A study led by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and published in this month’s issue of the scientific journal Health Affairs found that allotting funds to delayed aging research rather than individualized disease research would save the United States $7.1 trillion over the next 50 years.
The study, led by USC Schaeffer Director Dana Goldman, also included researchers from Harvard University, Columbia University and University of Illinois at Chicago. The analysts not only discovered the financial benefits of focusing on delayed aging research, but also found long-term effects these advances would have on population size. The amount of healthy adults over age 65 would increase by 5 percent per year, if more funds were spent on aging research.
Goldman said that if research on delayed aging continues, eventually human bodies could look younger than their chronological ages.
“People have long searched for the fountain of youth. We’re starting to understand at a basic cellular level how we accumulate age-related damage, the underlying biology of aging and the process of how cells grow, divide and age,” Goldman said.
Goldman noted that medical researchers have often been victims of their own achievements since advancing in the treatment for one disease usually results in the propagation of another.
“When we started looking into individual interventions for disease, we didn’t see the effect we thought we would. There were competing risks — if you save someone from one disease, they would end up getting something else,” Goldman said. “If we really want to make progress in expanding lifespan and healthy lives, we need to attack all diseases simultaneously. This is where delayed aging comes in.”
The study found that individually delaying either cancer or heart disease would not do much for the overall disabled population. Employing delayed aging research, however, will boost the amount of healthy adults older than age 65 to 11.7 million, ensuring a higher quality of life into old age.
Travis Eurick, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention who researches Alzheimer’s disease at the USC Davis School of Gerontology, was not surprised to hear the findings.
“Our culture definitely values the concept of youth, and as the baby boomers age, we will probably see [this research] take center stage,” Eurick said. “Research funding tends to be dispersed to fashionable topics, which I think could lead, and already has led, to increased research in aging.”
Helen Ma, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), expressed some skepticism over the viability of a projected population size under delayed aging.
“In order for us to effect these medical advances on society, our economic system would need to catch up fast. In its current state we wouldn’t be able to support such a top-heavy future population, considering that seniors are the fastest-growing age group to date,” Ma said.
Not all students are proponents of the suggested switch of research funding from cancer studies to aging studies.
“Even though delayed aging can make a big breakthrough in the medical field, I still believe funding cancer research is important; not all diseases manifest in old age,” said Crystal Tran, a sophomore majoring in biology.
Goldman asserted that some opponents are not taking into account that a higher quality of life delays the aging process.
“Some say, ‘Why would I want to live to 100, living to 80 is good enough.’ It’s the wrong view -— if you can give people healthy life, it’s in the better interest of society,” Goldman said.
The study’s findings also offer new opportunities for students who are passionate about the field.
“It’s definitely a field of study that’s important to delve into, and it makes me more aware that these sorts of studies will come up as I get older,” said Joseph Yoo, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry. “It’s honestly making me more excited for trying out research.”
“look younger than their chronological ages” – I think that is a gross misnomer. What WE today think is “looking like one’s chronological age” is just drawn from what we observe. If human beings in the near future look less “haggard” at a certain age than they are expected to nowadays, that will be the “look a la chronological” du jour THEN. There is no such thing as looking any age, only a perceived concept of how one “ought to look” based on perceived averages.
Quality of life is very important factor for the extension of life average. The right mentality for every man who respects himself is that we should try to live as longer as possible even beyond 100. In order to achieve this goal we should exercise regularly and follow a healthy diet and a relaxed life style. We should accept the fact that we grow up with grace and we shouldn’t try to act frivolously pretending something we’re not.

On Monday afternoon, USC’s Students for Justice in Palestine and the Political Student Assembly co-sponsored an event featuring author and activist Josh Ruebner.
Speak out · Josh Ruebner discusses his book Shattered Hopes: Obama’s Failure to Broker Israeli-Palestinian Peace Monday at the Campus Center. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Ruebner, a former Middle East analyst for the Congressional Research Service and the current national advocacy director of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, discussed his book, Shattered Hopes: Obama’s Failure to Broker Israeli-Palestinian Peace, which analyzes the Obama administration’s current policies on Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.
Ruebner began the discussion by exploring the recent history of conflict resolution, from the French colonization of Algeria to the Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland.
“Why do I raise these historical conflicts at the outset of my talk?” Ruebner asked the crowd of approximately 20 students. “I raise them because we hear that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is intrinsically and inherently more complex and difficult to resolve than other conflicts.”
Ruebner, however, said he disagreed with this sentiment.
 
“I don’t believe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is inherently more difficult to understand or resolve than decolonizing Algeria or ending apartheid in South Africa or arranging for power-sharing in Northern Ireland,” he said.
Though the discussion began by recounting the history of the conflict to the presence of more than 5 million Palestinian refugees around the world today, Ruebner ultimately focused on the numerous attempts made by the United States to broker peace in the contested region. He also frequently likened the laws governing the area to apartheid in South Africa.
“The reason why this peace process fails, and will continue to fail, is because the peace process has not been about ending Israel’s apartheid policies toward the Palestinians,” Ruebner said. “Rather, it has been about enforcing them.”
In comparing the Obama administration’s approach to brokering peace negotiations to those of past administrations, Ruebner highlighted instances in which Obama broke from the United States’ traditional stance on the conflict, including his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion.
“There is no doubt that President Barack Obama has had more understanding of and empathy with Palestinians and Palestinian-Americans,” Ruebner said. “Hands down.”
Ruebner also noted instances in which Obama’s administration aligned with past administrations, including his decision to increase the amount of military aid to Israel from $2.5 billion to $3.1 billion and pursuing peace negotiations in light of recent Israeli settlement expansion. To Ruebner, however, such policies continue to make the United States a “dishonest broker” in peace negotiations.
“Under international law, when you provide weapons to one side of a conflict, you have broken the laws of neutrality,” Ruebner said.
In closing, Ruebner compared the United States’ continued policies toward Israel and Palestine to a definition of insanity.
“It brings to mind Einstein’s definition of insanity — which is to do the same thing over and over again and expect that somehow you’re going to get a different result,” Ruebner said. “You’re not. That’s why we will have failure this time around as well.”
Despite the less than optimistic conclusion to the talk, many students said they appreciated the clear presentation of the contested issue.
“I thought it was very informative,” said Sean McGuire, a senior majoring in international relations and economics. “He did a really good job of laying out the policies that each of these administrations have pursued and juxtaposing them with the Obama administration’s policies.”
To Students for Justice in Palestine President Ifrah Sheikh, the presentation allowed students to examine the Obama administration from a variety of viewpoints.
“I really liked how he broke down in very clear, concise and specific points what Obama has done in the region, both positive and negative,” Sheikh said. “It’s very easy to focus on the negatives and not always look at the positives of what they’ve done.”

•	There is no “Palestine”. There might have been, but they chose war instead- time and again:
The would-have-been “Palestinians” would have had a state IN PEACE in 1937 with the Peel Plan, but they violently rejected it.
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1939 with the MacDonald White Paper, but they violently rejected it (and Jews would have even been restricted from BUYING land from Arabs).
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1948 with UN 181, but they violently rejected it (and actually claimed that the UN had no such mandate!).
They could have had a state IN PEACE in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza from 1948-1967 without any Jews- because the Arabs had ethnically cleansed every last one; but they violently rejected it. In fact, that’s exactly when they established Fatah (1959) and the PLO (1964).
They could have had a state IN PEACE after 1967, but instead, the entire Arab world issued the Khartoum Resolutions:
A. No peace with Israel
B. No recognition of Israel
C. No negotiations with Israel
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 2000 with the Oslo Accords, but they violently rejected it- as always.
And as soon as Israel pulled every single Israeli out of Gaza, what did the would-have-been “Palestinians” do? They immediately started shooting thousands of missiles into Israeli population centers, they elected Hamas (whose official platform calls for jihad with no negotiations until Israel is destroyed) to rule them, and they have dug tunnels crossing into the Negev to kill and kidnap Israelis.
And even afterwards, Ehud Olmert made his subsequent generous offer that went far beyond even that of Barak. The would-have-been “Palestinians” rejected it.
They had many chances.
They threw them all away because destroying Israel was higher on their priority list. It still is.
Oh well. That’s their choice.
Given that you support the Palestinians who openly advocate Jewish genocide (see their duly elected leaders clear-cut party covenants), you correspondingly do as well. It’s hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would openly advocate the liquidation of Jews, but you clearly do and it doesn’t seem to bother you a whit.
Moreover, it would be hard to believe that anyone would support second class status for women, the honor murder of teenage girls, the brutalization of gays and the suppression of dissenters. But you, as supporters of the Palestinians who regularly practice all of the above, are therefore complicit in these sexist, racist and fascist beliefs as well.
Why are you so bigoted, misogynist, anti-gay and such hater of Jews? Please tell us pray tell.
And if to be opposed to such garbage practiced by so many Muslims world-wide makes one an Islamophobe, count me and all who believe in freedom and hate sexism and bigotry vs Jews as a proud Islamophobe.
•	Apartheid = “apart” + “hood”. This is, and has been the Arabs’ policy; a Jew-free land. This is also why they ethnically cleansed Judea, Samaria, and Gaza of ALL Jews in 1948. It hasn’t been, nor is it, the Jewish policy, and over a million Arab citizens of Israel (and growing) are proof.
Yes children: Jews did live in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza- ALWAYS.
Well, obviously Jews lived here during Biblical times. We all know that.
If you look at the documents from the Cairo Geniza, dating back to the 9th century, you’ll find that there were Jews in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza.
If you look at travelers’ accounts from the Early Middle Ages, such as Nahmanides, Benjamin of Tudela, and a host of others, you’ll find that there were Jews in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza.
Rabbi Jechiel Ashkenazi, who was actually Sepharadi, purchased the Karite synagogue of Hebron in 1540 on behalf of the Sepharadi congregants.
If you read about Shabtai Tzvi, the false messiah of the 16th century, you’ll find that his “prophet” was Nathan of Gaza, where the center of his movement was located for a period.
In 1845, Dr. Ernst-Gustav Schultz, the Prussian Consul in Jerusalem, discussed the Jews living in Shechem (Nablus) and Hebron in his book, “Jerusalem, Eine Vorlesung”.
In fact, except for the periods of 1929-1931 and 1936-1968, there has been a significant Jewish presence in Hebron SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES.
The ONLY period of time where there were no Jews in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza was between 1948-1967, when the Arabs ethnically-cleansed ALL Jews from here.
And insisting that Judea be Jew-free again IS apartheid.
Bravo USC for allowing someone besides the Israelis to explain the Aparteid of the Occupied Territories. Sooner or later Israel with have to acknowledge these people exist along side themselves and that they are good honest people who deserve respect and kindness and above all humanity.
Now, don’t come back and talk about the few psychos that “Ruin It” for you. Israel has it fair share of psychos running the government. These are two sides equal in character and morals–time to accept it.
Why was there no quote or opinion of someone who disagreed with the speaker? I can appreciate that people agree with him, but I’m sure there’s opposition to what he said. The article shows a very one-sided recap of the event and I would hope that the Daily Trojan would be more conscious of that when publishing their content.

Actor and comedian Will Ferrell and Craig Pollard, founder of a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing college scholarships to cancer survivors, spoke to a packed crowd at Bovard Auditorium on Monday night.
Trojan Family mentors · USC alumni Will Ferrell and Craig Pollard share their careers, lifelong friendship and personal philosophies with students on Monday at Bovard Auditorium. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Ferrell and Pollard, both alumni of USC, came to speak as representatives of Pollard’s nonprofit, Cancer for College, for which Ferrell serves as a celebrity spokesperson. The two met during their time as students at USC when they were members of the same fraternity, Delta Tau Delta.
The discussion, moderated by David Belasco, co-director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and a professor in the Marshall School of Business, focused on Pollard’s process of creating his non-profit and the progression of Ferrell’s career.
“Everyone here has been affected by cancer, and everyone here has laughed at a Will Ferrell movie,” Belasco said to introduce the speakers.
After battling cancer twice — once at the age of 15 and again at 19 — Pollard came up with the idea of starting Cancer for College as his senior year project while attending the Marshall School of Business. In 1993, he held a golf tournament fundraiser in his backyard, and Cancer for College awarded its first scholarship of $500. Ferrell, a good friend of Pollard’s, has remained supportive of the organization throughout his comedy and acting career.
“I still have a copy of check Will gave me in 1992 for 50 bucks,” Pollard said.
The organization has now given approximately $2 million in scholarship funds to more than 2,000 students. The non-profit continues to hold an annual golf tournament in San Diego, which Ferrell hosts, and sells a sunscreen endorsed by Ferrell, for which all proceeds go to the charity.
“Craig came to me and said, ‘You’ve always dreamed of owning your own lotion company,’ and here we are,” Ferrell said. “It sells really well, and it works. It’s not just a stupid thing.”
The talk also touched on highlights of Ferrell’s career as an actor and comedian. Ferrell said that Pollard was often one of the few people in the audience during his first stand-up comedy gigs in the Los Angeles area.
Belasco related various aspects of the field of entrepreneurship to Ferrell’s struggles as a comedian before being cast on Saturday Night Live. Belasco also showed one of Ferrell’s preliminary audition tapes for the long-running NBC sketch comedy show in which he was asked to improvise a sketch using cat toys as props.
“There I was in that laughless void playing with cat toys and in my mind, I was thinking, ‘This is over,’” Ferrell said.
According to Belasco, Ferrell’s determination to succeed in the often-tedious entertainment field mirrors his most outstanding quality on stage.
“That is your most distinguishing characteristic: the risk. You are willing to do anything and humiliate yourself,” Belasco said.
Ferrell also discussed his experience as a student at USC. He acknowledged that times spent joking with his friends as a student prepared him for a career in entertainment.
“It’s not like you have a source or a confidante you can bounce ideas off of when it comes to comedy. You really just have to believe it,” Ferrell said. “In a way, my time here at school was a stage.”
The trailer for Ferrell’s new film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, was played before the start of the program, in addition to various clips related to Ferrell’s career at USC and as an actor. After a clip of a class taught by Belasco in which former USC head football coach Pete Carroll described a football practice that Ferrell attended, Carroll joined the discussion via Skype for a few moments to voice his support for Cancer for College.
Ferrell also joked about his athletic ability, in addition to voicing his support for, and impersonating, interim head football coach Ed Orgeron.
According to Ferrell, Pollard did not let his battle with cancer prevent him from taking advantage of all the social and academic opportunities that USC had to offer.
“All of us as his friends had no idea. He kind of kept all this to himself,” Ferrell said.
Cancer for College has begun to expand its services to providing scholarships to students dealing with health problems other than cancer after Pollard contracted a bacterial infection in 2006, which resulted in the amputation of both his legs. Cancer for College gave its first scholarship to an amputee later that year.
Ferrell joked with Pollard about his tendency to avoid bringing attention to his own medical issues.
“I had no idea you don’t have two legs. I just realized that now,” Ferrell said jokingly.
Pollard said that he hopes to expand Cancer for College to become a $10 million foundation in five years, and that working in the non-profit field has helped him realize his passions in life.
“It’s not about what you have, it’s about the people you love and its about making a difference in the world,” Pollard said.
Ferrell concluded the event by dressing up in full Trojan regalia and leading the USC Trojan Marching Band.

On Monday, USC freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week for the third consecutive week and the fourth time this season.
Making the grade · USC freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has excelled so far this season and ranks second on the team with 174 kills. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Nwanebu’s performance was integral in leading the Women of Troy to sweeps in both matches against Oregon State and Oregon. On Friday against the Beavers, Nwanebu posted seven kills and a .286 hitting percentage over three sets. She also had three blocks to go along with her offensive outburst.
Two days later at Oregon, Nwanebu surpassed her numbers from Friday and had a .273 hitting percentage, two digs, three blocks and a team-leading 11 kills. Across both matches, Nwanebu scored 3.50 points per set, hit .277 and had one block per set.
Nwanebu has stepped up her game at a critical time in the season for the Women of Troy. Over the last three weeks, USC played its first six conference matches of the season. Not surprisingly, the squad has gone undefeated in those six games, posting their best start to conference play in seven years.
Nwanebu is not the only USC freshman to pick up the award during this season. On Sept. 16, outside hitter Elise Ruddins was selected as Freshman of the Week after helping lead the Women of Troy to two wins in the USD Tournament. Ruddins was also named to the all-tournament team that week. The number of weekly honors for the team now stands at seven, as senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and senior libero Natalie Hagglund won Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week, respectively, one week ago.
Only one player has ever won the honor more than four times since the award’s inception in 2011: USC sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who won the award five times last season.
Assuming Nwanebu can keep up her current pace, she seems likely to surpass Bricio for most Freshman of the Week honors. USC will travel to Arizona State and Arizona this weekend to try to keep its 10-match winning streak alive.

It started around 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, roughly two hours before kickoff. USC coaches, players and players’ family members gathered around midfield at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for a pregame prayer and pep talk, led by interim head coach Ed Orgeron. The purpose, players said, was to emphasize the overarching theme that will drive this year’s Trojans to wherever they end up: family.
“It was a great feeling. The team that prays together stays together,” redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said after USC’s 38-31 victory over Arizona. “We are one big family and we wanted to bring the parents in and all pray together. Coach O emphasized that we are a unit, so it was great to bring everyone together.”
In the two weeks since he’s taken over as leader of the program, Orgeron has preached three things to his players: be physical up front, play with enthusiasm and have fun. All three attributes have been tenets of Orgeron’s coaching philosophy throughout his career, and players seem rejuvenated by the sudden infusion of energy following the dismissal of former head coach Lane Kiffin.
“He’s the definition of ‘Fight On’ and being a Trojan,” redshirt senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard said of Orgeron. “You can’t do anything but love him. He’ll get after you when you do something wrong, but once you start doing things right, there’s nobody that [will] be more excited for you than him. We’ll go through a wall for Coach O.”
To call Orgeron the anti-Kiffin would be fairly accurate. Kiffin was renowned for his knowledge of the Xs and Os and had total control over the Trojans’ offense during his three-plus seasons at USC. In his first game as interim head coach, what input did Orgeron give to offensive coordinator Clay Helton, who called the plays against Arizona?
“I didn’t have to say a word on the headsets, except ‘Atta boy, good job Cody, good job Clay,’” Orgeron said.
Where Kiffin was reserved on the sidelines during games, Orgeron was anything but on Thursday. Not only was he fired up himself, but he implored his players to join in on the high-fives and chest bumps, and the players by and large embraced this drastic change in sideline behavior.
“[Defensive linemen] know how Coach O is, so it’s funny seeing other guys getting hyped up now by some of the things he’s doing,” Kennard said. “It’s awesome seeing how infectious he can be to an entire team.”
Orgeron’s tactics have been effective, at least for one week, because his rah-rah persona seems 100 percent sincere, just as Kiffin’s stoicism was an indelible part of his identity.
Neither approach is inherently better or worse than the other; coaches such as Kansas State’s Bill Snyder and Stanford’s David Shaw have experienced tremendous success throughout their careers while maintaining a certain level of calm on the sidelines. But Orgeron’s style has certainly been effective in motivating this current group of players and has earned him the respect of the athletic administration.
“Ed is a very iconic figure around here. What impresses me is that he brings it every day,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said. “This is not a fake thing with him. He brings the energy every day, and I think our guys really appreciate it. He’s a great coach, and people like Ed. He’s a very likeable guy, and that’s a good thing right now.”
Haden is unquestionably a very smart man, and he chooses his words carefully. When speaking about Orgeron, the phrase “right now” seems most appropriate in discussing his suitableness as USC’s next head coach, sans the “interim” prefix.
I don’t know that Orgeron is the best candidate to become USC’s permanent head coach, and I don’t know that he isn’t. At this point, it’s far too early to make that kind of judgment, and Haden is very aware of this.
But Orgeron is the perfect coach for USC “right now.” At this juncture, USC does not need a coach; it needs a leader. This is not to say that Kiffin could not lead, but Orgeron is much better suited to pilot the team in a time of crisis. He’s the ideal candidate for the “break glass in case of emergency” situation the USC football program currently finds itself in.
After the win against Arizona, it seemed as though players were fighting among themselves to see who could give Orgeron the best compliment. Positive energy is always a good thing, but USC won’t be able to reach its goals this season based on good morale alone. There are still many issues the team has to deal with, such as its pass defense and lack of depth at wide receiver. Those areas must be fixed for the wins to start piling up.
But that doesn’t seem to be of much concern for USC players, who are merely happy to see their beloved Coach O enjoy success. In the competition for praising Orgeron, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler might have finished in first place:
“You want a coach that you would go to war for every time,” Kessler said. “[With Orgeron], and I don’t just speak for myself, I speak for the whole team, we would go to war for this guy any day of the week. When you can not only see but feel that he cares about you so much, that’s love right there. I couldn’t ask for a better head coach right now.”
And as of right now, how could it get any better than that?

Coming off of an emotional 38-31 victory over Arizona in interim head coach Ed Orgeron’s USC coaching debut, the USC football team looks to take advantage of its extra two days of rest as it prepares to play Notre Dame this weekend.
Well done · USC’s offensive line, led by junior center Marcus Martin (66), earned high praise after its strong performance against Arizona. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Fighting Irish, who finished the 2012 season ranked No. 2 in the nation, defeated the Trojans 22-13 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum last season to clinch a berth in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game.
Feelin’ good
Though the final score might not reflect it, USC played what, for the most part, was a very complete football game on Thursday. Despite a fourth-quarter rally in which Arizona took advantage of errors made by the USC defense, the team looked very good for most of the game, Orgeron was focused on the positive aspects of Thursday night.
“A lot of good things,” Orgeron said when asked what he took away from his first game as head coach at USC. “There are some things to fix on defense that I know we’re going to get fixed, but very positive, great feeling.”
Orgeron was chosen as the replacement for former head coach Lane Kiffin in large part because of the energy and enthusiasm he was expected to bring to the team, and he succeeded in that regard on Thursday.
“The energy Coach O brings and the passion he brings to everything he does, we responded well. The whole team loves it,” said redshirt senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard after the win.
Big blocks
The much-maligned USC offensive line has taken a fair amount of criticism this season for its inability to protect the Trojans’ many offensive weapons. But the unit had perhaps its best game of the season Thursday, and it got plenty of praise from Orgeron.
Not only did the offensive line open up holes for five different running backs that collectively, along with redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, amassed 249 rushing yards. More importantly, the line did not surrender a single sack for the first time all season.
On the final drive of the game, in need of enough first downs before the team could comfortably run out the clock, the Trojans’ offensive line pushed through the Wildcat defense and allowed the USC rushing attack to clinch the victory.
“I liked the way we ran the ball,” Orgeron said. “I thought the offensive line played well and won the game at the end.”
Just another game
Regarded as one of the greatest rivalries in all of college sports, Orgeron acknowledged that Saturday’s game against the Fighting Irish is certainly very important.
Orgeron said that he learned of the importance of the game during his first assistant coaching stint with USC between 1998 and 2004, when USC legend Marv Goux, who played linebacker at USC in the early 1950s and spent decades as an assistant coach, explained how much the rivalry meant to the school and alumni.
Despite the added importance placed on the game, though, Orgeron emphasized that the team’s approach would not change in the days leading up to Saturday.
“One of the things we talked about when we took over is that we’re going to treat every game as a separate game, one game at a time,” he said. “It just so happens that we play Notre Dame this week, but we need to control what we can control, play great fundamental football, and I’m sure we’re going to be ready to play Saturday night.”
Physical force
As a former defensive line coach, Orgeron knows a lot about big, physical defensive lines. And that’s just what he called Notre Dame’s.
“They’re very good on goal line defense,” Orgeron said. “We learned that last year.”
Orgeron was referencing the now-infamous goal line stand made by Notre Dame late in the fourth quarter of last season’s matchup, in which USC failed to score despite running four consecutive plays from the 1-yard line.
Orgeron knows even more pressure will be put on USC’s offensive line against Notre Dame this year, but he expressed confidence in his group’s ability to get the job done this time around.
“Just take care of what we can do,” he said. “Get better, one heartbeat, one team.”

In what is becoming one of the best rivalries in all of college athletics, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team avenged its early-season loss to crosstown rival No. 1 UCLA in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion to defend their SoCal Tournament championship in Irvine, Calif. this past weekend.
Clutch · Thanks to some late-game heroics from USC junior driver Kostas Genidounias, the Trojans were able to top the No. 1-ranked Bruins in the SoCal Tournament championship. Genidounias scored a team-high four goals. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (17-1) trailed the top-ranked Bruins for the majority of the game and were down 10-7 with 4:08 remaining before they began their comeback. The ensuing victory not only represented a comeback to win the game, but one to regain USC’s footing as the top team in the land.
It started with a power play goal by senior two-meter Connor Virjee, which was followed by a goal by senior driver Nikola Vavic. Finally, senior utility Mace Rapsey put in the equalizer to tie the match at 10-10 with 1:30 remaining.
But the Trojans’ work was not done, as UCLA (18-1) took the lead right back just 30 seconds later. Like so many times before, though, USC would not go away, and junior driver Kostas Genidounias broke the Bruins’ hearts with a goal just before the final buzzer to push the game to overtime.
The teams remained tied at 11 after neither team was able to score in the first overtime period. Genidounias opened up the scoring in the second overtime period to give USC its first lead of the game since holding a 1-0 lead in the first. The USC defense, led by senior goalie James Clark, was able to hold off the Bruins’ extra man advantage and maintain the lead to win another one-goal match 12-11 and bring home another SoCal Tournament title.
“I am very proud of our team,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “I am most proud of how hard our team played in those last three minutes. They really played with a true heart of a champion.”
Nikola Vavic and Genidounias both came up clutch in the win with four goals apiece and continued to lead the USC attack, just as they did all of last season. Virjee tallied two goals as well, while Clark had seven saves in goal.
By winning back-to-back SoCal titles, USC has now won 10 out of the last 11 SoCal crowns. The Trojans clinched their spot in the title match with a 10-6 win in the semifinals over No. 3-ranked Pacific, in which Vavic took over as USC’s all-time leading scorer.
The one-goal win over UCLA is also the fifth consecutive time that the two storied programs have had their game decided by only one goal, dating back to 2012.
USC has now won four of its last five games against UCLA. The last time both teams had a match decided by more than one goal was in 2011 when USC defeated UCLA 7-4 in the national championship game.
By defeating the top-ranked team in the country, USC is expected to reclaim its No. 1 ranking this week. UCLA earned its No. 1 ranking after snapping USC’s 41-game winning streak on Sept. 22 at the NorCal Tournament.
The two teams will meet at least once more on Nov. 21, when USC goes to Westwood for another epic clash.
“This win puts us in a good spot, but we have quite a bit of water polo to play,” Vavic said. “We could see all of these teams multiple times again in conference play and the NCAA tournament.”
The team returns home to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday for a pair of matches against nonconference opponents Loyola Marymount and Cal Lutheran. USC will play the Lions at 1 p.m. before jumping right back in the pool to take on the Kingsmen at 3 p.m.

Mi Cultura Night might be the only time one can find free Latin cuisine, a harpist, Bollywood and hip-hop dancers, Mariachi singers and Japanese drummers all in Ground Zero. The final extravaganza, which will conclude the Latina/o Student Assembly’s celebration of Hispanic Heritage month on Tuesday is a way to get USC students more familiar with Latino culture. When the event was first introduced, its sole purpose was to bring Latino culture to USC in a fun, entertaining way. Now, however, nearly a dozen cultures are represented at Mi Cultura Night, and that number continues to increase.

“On a greater scale, [Mi Cultura night] showcases not only Latino heritage but other cultures and backgrounds found at USC,” said Giovanni Navarrate, president of Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Incorporated. “It is a way to pay homage and celebrate Los Angeles and the cultures that make up its ethnic, racial and cultural DNA.”
Hermanas Unidas, Inc., a member organization in the LSA, a division of the USC Program Board, organized the first Mi Cultura Night in 2007.
“We constructed the skeleton of the event early on. We were able to add a different flair this year by incorporating more diverse performances, not just strictly Latino in order to celebrate other cultures on campus and in the Angeleno community,” Navarrate said about this year’s event.
The club organized the event to encourage more students to learn about and get involved with the LSA.
“One of LSA’s goals is not only to increase our visibility on campus through our programming and constructive dialogue but also to branch out to other organizations,” said John Mendoza, LSA Professional Affairs chair. “It embraces diversity. It displays unity. And it creates relationships between people who embody the solidarity that is the Trojan Family.”
A member of a bicultural household, LSA Executive Director Valerie Fernandez wants to showcase the diversity of Latino culture and she thinks that Mi Cultura Night can do that.
“I come from a Mexican and Salvadoran household; both are Latino heritages but they are very different from each other,” Fernandez said. “One thing the Latino Student Association [with] Mi Cultura Night intends to do is highlight differences in Latino culture. I think it’s awesome that … we provide a more inclusive representation of different cultures.”
The night provides students with an opportunity to participate in an expression of human solidarity through performances from various Hispanic cultures at the culmination of Hispanic Heritage Month.
“[It’s] a fusion of as many cultures as possible,” Fernandez said.
The changes in demographics and student backgrounds has prompted the organizers of Mi Cultura Night to continue adding new cultures to their mix.
“Times are changing and … we have to use this as a stage to present other peoples’ culture,” Navarrate said. “We want to cater to everyone.”
Mi Cultura Night this year will feature Breakthrough, USC’s premier hip-hop group, Bollywood dancers, a harpist, Japanese drummers, a jazz singer, a Mariachi band and more.
“[We] bring in performers from the student body and local community — who represent different cultures — [into] one venue where USC students, family and anyone in the surrounding neighborhood are able to take pride with performers they identify with and also be exposed to cultures outside their circle,” Mendoza said.
The night presents a chance for USC students to see some of the ways that students from various backgrounds connect with their culture in college.
“We are highlighting that having a designated month to celebrate the accomplishments of Latinos in America means celebrating other cultures from all over the world that make up a more encompassing picture of what, not one, but the many faces of America really look like — diverse.” Fernandez said. “It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle. This night is a reminder of how people stay connected with their culture even in college.”
Mi Cultura Night comes to USC tonight from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Ground Zero Performance Cafe.

For its 16th birthday, Yahoo decided to celebrate by changing the look of its email inbox. The result? The makeover made Yahoo’s inbox look cleaner, flatter and eerily familiar — if you compare Yahoo’s email interface side-by-side with that of Gmail’s. The setup and the spacing of the navigation and inbox sections are now strikingly similar.
Keeping up with Google · Yahoo celebrated its 16th anniversary by releasing a new user interface for its email users. The revamp bears an uncanny resemblance to the one currently used by Google’s Gmail. – Photo illustration by Ralf Cheung
 
But the two email platforms are not identical. Yahoo, unlike Gmail, plays around with icons in the navigation and transparency in the actual inbox section. Not to mention the fact that Gmail still has more customization to offer, especially when it comes to its Labs section — the “testing ground” for various email features in beta.
According to Email Marketing Reports, Yahoo has around 100 million fewer users than Gmail as of 2012. But after making the move to offer new usernames by clearing out accounts that have been inactive for more than a year, there’s a possibility that Yahoo could catch up. Maybe.
Despite Gmail’s popularity, it still isn’t perfect. It’s easy to forget to reply to emails, especially if you’ve already read an email. And were you one of the users affected by Google’s lengthy outage just a couple of weeks ago? Considering that Google handles an enormous amount of data, the incident was forgivable. But even one of the most capable companies on the planet hasn’t completely mastered the art of email.
So what might characterize the perfect email platform?
For one, the platform would have to vary from person to person. If we all operated the same way, most products would be designed perfectly by now. Some people, however, are terrible at checking their email. Others are not so great at replying. Regardless of your email habits, we’re getting closer to finding the best kind of inbox.
Scheduling, as seen from the Mailbox app, is definitely one of the more helpful email features out there that could improve the rate at which people reply. In the app, different swipes mean different things. Swipe right quickly, and you’ve marked an email as read. Swipe it to the right slowly, and the email has been deleted. But when you swipe left, you can schedule when you want your email to re-send — i.e. later today, this evening, next weekend, etc. It’s not a foolproof system, but once you get the hang of it, rescheduling when your emails arrive to your inbox can seriously improve how you communicate with email.
But perhaps designating when emails should arrive seems like a task in itself. Mail Pilot is both a mobile and desktop app that turns your inbox into a to-do list, so any unread emails turn into tasks that need to be completed. Emails that are put off are listed as past due and are prioritized. It’s a great idea, and effective if you want to improve how you check your email. The more emails you fail to read, however, the more tasks you’ll accumulate. And let’s face it — since emails aren’t graded, nor do they have an actual deadline, it’s tempting to put them off until later.
That’s where notifications come in. We already get push notifications — the pop-ups that come up on our smartphones — from our apps and email. Why not take it a step further and integrate Facebook-like notifications to email? With his project .Mail, designer Tobias van Schneider wants to make your inbox more like a social network, so that we feel more inclined to respond as we do when friends post on our timelines or comment on photos.
And like Facebook, algorithms for email could be yet another way to impel people to get through their emails quicker and more efficiently. Gmail already does something similar to this by marking certain emails important based on your previous interactions with the email address. But what about an inbox that places higher-priority emails at the top of your inbox? You wouldn’t miss a beat with people you communicate with frequently, but you might accidentally overlook important “cold emails” from job recruiters or people who want to connect with you.
As of now, my go-to email platform is Mailbox. It’s only available on iOS at the moment, but Mailbox’s founder, Gentry Underwood, has hinted that Mailbox on Android is on the startup’s to-do list, as well as an app for desktop.
Mailbox is not perfect yet, but as soon as the desktop version comes out, the email game could be changed forever by giving users the ability to switch between mobile and desktop without missing a single postponed email.
But until we find the panacea for email, there are some ways to improve your email experience now. In terms of extensions you can add to email, Boomerang is a Firefox plugin that allows you to schedule when you send and receive messages on Gmail. To track whether people read your emails or not, you can add Yesware to Gmail, which allows you to find out who opens your emails and click on any links in the email. There’s also Rapportive, which builds a rich profile of the person you are emailing, with links to their Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, personal website and other social media sites.
As helpful as all these features and extensions may be, they can be very overwhelming. If you really want to be good at emailing others, the best thing you can do is set aside two times during the day to do nothing but check your inbox and reply to emails, one after the other.
Email has come a long way. Despite the fact that it’s still not perfect, it’s hard to imagine what life would be like without email at this moment. How would you be able to apply for jobs? Reach out to professors? Communicate for group projects? Though Yahoo’s update wasn’t particularly monumental, it’s certainly a step “forward” in the right direction in the name of email.

As Asian comfort food goes, it’s hard to find an entree friendlier to American palates than tonkatsu. It’s a panko-breaded pork cutlet that’s deep-fried and served with a tangy, Worcestershire-like sauce. The dish was invented by the Japanese sometime in the early 19th century, and has become popular in both Japan and Korea.
Panna notta · Kimukatsu’s panna cotta doesn’t actually taste like the beloved Italian dessert, and its texture is reminiscent of paste. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Enter Kimukatsu, a Japanese chain of tonkatsu restaurants which recently moved into spacious digs in Culver City’s new Culver Crossroads retail center off Sepulveda Boulevard. What sets Kimukatsu’s tonkatsu apart from the layperson’s katsu is the method of preparation: Instead of a single breaded cutlet, Kimukatsu breads 25 layers of thinly sliced pork which have been folded together, breaded and slowly fried to seal in the juices. The restaurant claims that this process creates a more tender, juicier katsu. The concept sounds strange, but like raw tuna belly and deep-fried octopus balls, intrigue in Japanese cuisine tends to lend itself to pleasant results. Usually.
The first thing to notice before walking in through the glass doors of Kimukatsu is the large “Intent to Serve Alcoholic Beverages” notice posted conspicuously next to the door. It’s a sign — pardon the pun — that the restaurant doesn’t have all its affairs in order just yet.
Upon walking in, it becomes more evident that Kimukatsu is nowhere near ready for the clientele it’s anticipating. A massive oak bar imposes on a third of the restaurant’s space. Small, intimate booths line the walls and a handful of tables with tacky, mismatched steel chairs fill out the cramped center. Condiments are not uniformly distributed; a few tables are missing the ponzu vinaigrette, others the all-important tonkatsu sauce. There’s a distinction to be made between tasteful minimalism and simple carelessness. As first impressions go, Kimukatsu is already firmly entrenched in the latter category.
Like the restaurant’s ambiance, the menu is simple. Diners can choose from a handful of different katsu fillings (including cheese), toppings such as curry or mushrooms and a vast array of dipping sauces — none of which look appetizing enough to splurge the extra dollar for. Which leads to the next point: Kimukatsu’s entrees are rather expensive for what they are. A dinner portion of six ounces of katsu starts at $22; a lunch special portion of four ounces is $13.
The trend of dressing up working class dishes is not a foreign (or unpleasant) concept to anyone who’s had a hamburger from David Myers’ Comme Ca or thyme-dusted French fries with tarragon remoulade at 25 Degrees. But at $22 for a measly six ounces, a katsu should offer something special. Unfortunately for Kimukatsu’s tonkatsu, unless “something special” is “three days of agonizing food poisoning for a certain Daily Trojan editor,” it doesn’t.
The idea of making a tonkatsu “juicy” sounds a little counterintuitive at first — after all, a deep-fried, panko-crusted pork chop isn’t a medium-rare filet mignon. There are expectations of how certain foods should taste and feel, and to errantly thrust notions of textures that might be valid for one dish onto another is haphazard at best, a gimmicky atrocity at worst.
An extremely juicy tonkatsu doesn’t work for the single reason that a large part of the dish’s selling point is a substantive crunch. One bite into Kimukatsu’s tonkatsu and it’s clear they’ve completely lost sight of what makes good katsu. Though the top shines golden brown, moisture soaks up the bottom layer into an oily, mealy paste. The pork lacks substance — instead, the allegedly tender meat flakes away like bad tilapia.
The shift in texture is also present in the most basic part of the meal: the rice. Though the top of the bowl shines with lustrous, firm grains, the watery clump of inedible rice underneath exposes the cook’s amateurish execution. The accompanying miso soup is also overwhelmingly salty and poorly balanced. Kimukatsu does deserve some credit — to fail this much in properly preparing the most basic Japanese food staples takes some serious effort. To open what looks to be an incredibly expensive restaurant to serve food this bad takes a special kind of audacity.
Dessert only makes the ongoing texture nightmare a disturbing reality. The panna cotta (which, it should be noted, came highly recommended by a server) looks like a clump of ricotta cheese, and the texture and flavor was reminiscent of an incredibly stubborn tapioca pudding. The staff here has either never tried actual panna cotta or hates their customers. Or both.
So for all of the hype and hoopla about a “juicy” tonkatsu being served deep in Bruin territory, Kimukatsu utterly fails to understand what makes a good tonkatsu in the first place. The restaurant paid extremely close attention to a worthless detail and failed to address the big picture just about everywhere else. It’s a flashy concept engineered toward a growing generation of pretentious food elitists.
Kimukatsu would do well to focus on the foundations of what makes good, edible comfort food in an effort to crawl back up to mediocrity. Instead, the restaurant has plans to open another location in Westwood. Which is, if you think about it, just too perfect.

Another play about men. What an overdone topic, right? But no, apparently there’s still more left to be said about them, and how they interact with each other, and how -— without the presence of a woman in their lives — they will remain absolutely disgusting until they implode with their own failures. Not depressing and annoying enough yet? Then We Got Lucky might be the play for you. This new production will take two hours out of an audience member’s life only to say that the world is an awful place filled with average and common people.
Not so lucky · We Got Lucky explores themes of bromance but ultimately fails to offer any meaningful dialogue. The theater production runs Fridays through Sundays until Nov. 3 at the Working Stage in West Hollywood. – Photo courtesy of Philip Sokoloff
 
On paper, director Allen C. Gardner’s new show is an interesting attempt at a bromance. It’s set in a living room that never changes over the course of 10 years. In the living room, the play tracks the lives of Aaron and Brad, two young men who meet by accident over dinner with their girlfriends and end up living together. As the years go by, they become more and more inseparable, as well as more and more obnoxious.
The storyline is bland and cliched, the ultimate tale of a semi-dysfunctional brotherhood. The fact that the men living together are pigs in both the moral and physical sense, until a woman comes along, doesn’t help either of their cases. Nor does that endear them to the audience — sure, for half of a scene Aaron starts to live like a human being when he dates a girl, but then he ruins it because he can’t handle something in his life being clean for once. It’s discouraging to see — not because one might feel any sort of emotion for the characters, but because one starts to realize the horrible implications of what society would look like were men to actually behave this way.
No one could possibly predict where the show is going to end. Please read that with the deepest and most sincere sarcasm: the play actually drags on until it finally, inevitably finishes. One’s attention drifts between vague interest and insipid boredom until eventually it just moves to a sincere desire for the final curtain to fall. Unfortunately, by the fourth near-ending (and since it’s not Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the show really has no right to do that), the audience has gone from vaguely interested to looking at their watches waiting for curtain call so they can leave the theater and resume their lives.
The biggest problem with We Got Lucky is that, though the play has a few golden moments in the name of brotherhood, both characters are so irritatingly unlikable that it is impossible to feel the least bit of sympathy for either of them. Brad’s face — fixed in a constant state of sad or awkward — along with his demeanor stays exactly the same as the play drags on through 10 long years, making it harder and harder to sympathize with him. Aaron, though he does change, is initially so unpleasant that his change is not nearly enough to make up for his failings. He goes from a party boy to a coke-headed party boy to a party boy with a stable job. That’s progress, right? He is a bully, one who should be constantly slapped in the face for the duration of the entire show. The fact that Brad won’t do so becomes increasingly tiresome.
Still, We Got Lucky is not a complete failure; there are a few sweet drunken lines exchanged between the main characters, such as, “There are good ships and wood ships and ships that sail, and sh-t, but the best ships are friendships, and may they always be!” or, “Sex on the beach ends on the beach.” These humorous moments, along with a talented cast of minor characters, might put a sporadic smile on an audience member’s face if one is still paying attention, bringing the play up to solidly mediocre.
On the whole, We Got Lucky suffers from the severe lack of development and intelligence of the main characters. It’s hard to root for a set of protagonists who are so obviously incapable of dealing with their own lives. Still, the show does have moments that can be appreciated by the insanely disciplined human beings who can sit for long periods of time in small dark theaters without needing a breath of fresh air.

If you happened to be strolling down Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue last week, you might have stopped in your tracks to look at a 10-foot-long dog lying on its side, covered in ketchup and mustard. This is part of another protest hosted by Mercy for Animals. Though advocating for animal rights is a worthy cause, the tactics that animal rights organizations employ to advocate vegan and vegetarian diets must change direction.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
The vegetarian and vegan crusade has good intentions. PETA makes a valid point by highlighting the mistreatment of animals. According to PETA, stressful conditions for livestock are commonplace in the food industry. Small cages, jam-packed sheds and filthy feedlots are the mainstays of the industry. Animals lie around, are drugged to be fattened and kept alive in conditions that would otherwise kill them.
Though some might dispute the accuracy of these statements, other news sources verify PETA’s claim. The recent outbreak of salmonella at Foster Farm’s chicken plants, according to the Portland Oregonian, expanded to 300 cases in 20 states and Puerto Rico and further emphasizes PETA’s quest against animal cruelty. A letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Foster Farms stated, “Your establishment has failed to demonstrate that it has adequate controls in place to address salmonella in your poultry products.”
Though the cruelty might be real, the impassioned vegans and vegetarians of Mercy for Animals cannot expect to convince others to abstain from meat by guilting them into it. Vegans and vegetarians should cater to humans’ inherent selfishness  instead of sticking to the lofty altruistic reasons that most people cannot relate to.
Take the Foster Farms incident, for instance. While we might not care too much about the chickens suffering, the impact that it has on our health does stir change. As Los Angeles Times opinion writer Paul Whitefield said, “Can we at least agree that we shouldn’t allow the stuff we eat to make us sick? Even the penny-pinchers in Congress ought to be willing to sign on to that. As in: I’ll trade you a couple of aircraft carriers for some inspectors who’ll make sure that my chicken sandwich won’t kill me.”
Motives tend to stem from the self, from issues that will impact us as humans. Though PETA’s claim that caged animals, deprived of exercise, channel all their energy to producing flesh, eggs and milk for human consumption is frightening, the effect of consuming these animals that have been psychologically perturbed is the pivotal point for most people. Genetically altered foods, such as milk from rBST-treated cows, are looked for with caution on the market shelves for fear of what it might do to us rather than the animals.
This self-absorbed mindset toward what we eat is something that vegan and vegetarian activists ought to take advantage of.
Changing food culture based on the cruelty done to animals is noble, but ineffective.
If animal activists and vegetarian organizations want to avoid being labeled as radical groups, then they must redirect the way they approach the public. The signs that Mercy for Animals held up, featuring photos of kittens posing with fluffy chicks and a puppy and piglet snuggled next to each other read, “Why love one but eat the other? Choose Vegetarian.”
These arguments make it too easy for their opponents to simply answer that some animals are meant to be pets, while others are intended to be livestock.

I agree with a number of things you bring up in this article, Valerie. People are not convinced of things be being guilted into it and the animal advocacy movement should not engage in this type of activism.
However, I urge you to think more about the last statement you make that “some animals are meant to be pets while others are intended to be livestock.” The truth is, there’s no meaningful difference between animals we call pets and those considered food. Similar to the cats and dogs many of us welcome into our homes, chickens, pigs, and cows are able to suffer from pain and experience pleasure in many of the same ways. They are unique individuals with a desire to live and avoid pain and suffering. What we choose to eat may be a personal choice, but who we eat, isn’t.
Fortunately, it’s never been easier to go vegetarian (or eat more meat-free meals on Meatless Monday) with an abundance of of plant-based version to virtually any food imaginable. To see the video the meat industry doesn’t want you to see, visit http://www.meatvideo.org and for free vegetarian recipes check out http://www.chooseveg.com
This article should have been titled “PETA Needs a New Approach”…not vegetarians. I became a vegetarian several years ago for health reasons, and also because avoiding beef is better for the environment. I have never had a single interaction with PETA in my entire life. It sucks that animals get mistreated but that has nothing to do with why I’m a vegetarian. To imply that PETA represents the interests of all vegetarians is like implying that all rectangles are squares, which geometry shows us they’re not. All squares are rectangles but not every rectangle is a square. More than likely all members of PETA are vegetarians, not all vegetarians are idiots, er…members of PETA.

The annoying, shrill, sanctimonious tactics of PETA and drum-beating vegans make me want to eat more meat. I am fine with people making personal choices for themselves but i find it despicable when they imposed their own perceived taboos onto others.
When you take the life of another living creature, you are imposing on these animals. Why is that so hard to understand?
People that decry meat need to travel more to parts of the world where starvation is commonplace. Many ppl in the US need to appreciate and respect the plentiful food source we have – perhaps too plentiful – they take it for granted and get on their high horse about nothing.
BTW – are you also opposed to leather? How about the myriad number of products you use that “imposed” animal products in some manner be it testing or for their fats, etc. PETA and annoying vegans love to just TSK TSK others – that is their kick. This is also, BTW – what liberals love to do as well.

It is difficult to imagine a father hurting one of his own. It is even more difficult to imagine someone   who has abused his family member getting off lightly. The behavior of Saudi Arabian preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi does not reflect the actions of a good father, nor any respectable man, for that matter: al-Ghamdi raped, beat and tortured his own 5-year-old daughter, Lama, to death. But his punishment? Just eight years in prison and 800 lashes.
Though many have cried out against the leniency of his consequences, which the Court of Riyadh levied on Oct. 8, few have questioned the Saudi Arabian law that allows al-Ghamdi to go scot-free. This law, according to the Agence France Presse, asserts that “a father cannot be executed for murdering his children, nor can husbands be executed for murdering their wives” even though other acts of rape and murder can be punished by death.
This policy proves that the Saudi Arabian government does not recognize women as human beings — wives and children are seen as the property of a man, as dispensable as material goods.
This mentality is ludicrous. Some actions are simply immoral, regardless of who they are carried out by. It is inexcusable for a country to impose the death penalty upon robbers and adulterers but not upon rapists and murderers for the sole reason that the perpetrator is related to his victims. The enforcement of this policy entitles all married men in Saudi Arabia to carry out senseless murders without serious enough ramifications.
Just this year, human rights activists celebrated a ban on domestic violence as a “landmark decision in Saudi Arabia,” according to CNN. A Washington Post headline read, “Saudi Arabia launches powerful ad campaign against domestic violence.”
And Bandar al-Aiban, president of Saudi Arabia’s Human Rights Commission, told CNN, “this shows the kingdom is really moving forward with enacting laws that protect its citizens and residents and to make sure the kingdom is now in accordance with international obligations and international standards regarding human rights.”
But Lama’s death demonstrates that the international community has fallen prey to Saudi Arabia’s smoke and mirrors. These campaigns do not rectify the true problem, which is a blatant disregard for the rights of all women in Saudi Arabia. And these newly created domestic violence laws, though hailed as a step in the right direction, are a minuscule step in the big picture.
The Saudi Arabian government might appear sympathetic to the needs of women, but do not be fooled — these statements and laws only mask the presence of more complex human rights problems.  Saudi Arabia is still mired in issues relating to the mistreatment of women and the global society cannot consent to the irrationality of Sharia law.
For one, women in Saudi Arabia cannot drive without a male companion. They cannot travel alone, participate in athletic activities or work in some industries. Though the international community is obligated to pressure Saudi Arabia to implement harsher domestic violence laws, until the misogynistic culture changes within the country, it is difficult to expect progress.
Cases of rape against daughters or sons are not unique to Saudi Arabia. Most recently, the Jersey Journal reported how a New Jersey man “faces multiple counts of child abuse, endangering the welfare of a child, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault by contact” for the raping his two daughters.
Evidently, the fundamental difference between the United States and Saudi Arabia is the concept of justice. American citizens can depend on their judicial system to act fairly, handing down appropriate punishments. But in the case of Lama, whose life was stolen by the man who gave it to her, justice was not served.

Social and economic Conditions of Woman & Girls are very bad therefore, taking blood maney is good. Many state like Saudi failed to protect woment and child rights. They always protects their kindom and not citizen. They use Islam just a tool to rule.
Sameer,
You see things accurately.  Just as Muslims are using Islam throughout the Hindu world to destroy the Hindu culture and people so are they doing elsewhere.
I hope you will also inform the user that the same applies if it was a mother who killed a son. A mother cannot be killed for killing her son either. The reason is not that it is ok to kill them, but that the family has already lost one member, so it shouldn’t be forced to lose another. Will you want your government to kill your mother, because she killed your father?
So much for the “Religion of Peace”.
And watch another human get his head sawed off on YouTube.
Dont confuse a religion with a country that is acting strange. If a pope or cardinal is caught sexually assaulting a little boy, will you blame Christianity ? Of course not. Be fair in your judgement and leave your personal grunge aside. This is a serious matter that demands serious thoughts, not below-the-belt attacks against a religion that has nothing to do with such crime!
Ray,
You have no idea what you are talking about.  The Quran makes clear that women are men’s property.  This message is conveyed throughout the Quran.  Furthermore Islam’s prophet, Mohammed, raped women slaves and married 11 different women.
But here is what says it all:  Mohammed’s last wife, Aisha, was only six years old when he married her.  He consummated that marriage when she was nine and he was 54 thereby setting a standard which many Muslims follow to this day.
Ray, your a typical moral relativist; believing all religions are more or less the same and that people are not influenced, socialized or morally sculpted by their religion.  This is pretty funny when considering a high percentage of Muslims are forced to memorize the Quran and are thoroughly brainwashed by an Islamic society which permits no free thought.
You have a lot to learn Ray.
I applaud the writer in coming out and saying what is obvious. I get angry thinking we live in a world where sanctimonious feminists, liberals and any other spineless mouthpiece displays anger at an off color remarks a drunken Mel Gibson makes towards a female police officer, but then remain silent or “tolerant” on issues of blatant criminal abuse if the abuse is being committed in a non Western culture. This senseless rape as well as atrocities such as female genitalia mutilation need to be called out as the barbaric thinking of a bronze age culture and have no place in the modern world. Yet you will seldom hear many people, let alone feminists talk about this. Those mealy-mouthed cowards primarily save their vitriol for middle aged white men who do not conform to the strict guidelines in our ultra politically correct society.

USC has issued new sanctions on The Row after a string of hospital transports during what Student Affairs characterized as the “worst weekend of the semester.”
According to a memo sent from Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Beth Saul and Associate Director for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development Ray Carlos and obtained by the Daily Trojan, fraternities and sororities can only host registered events between Friday at 3 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m. Students will also be required to show USC identification in order to attend events.
Registered events must also be approved by the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon has also been placed on social probation, according to a statement from Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
Between Thursday and Sunday, ambulances transported seven people due to alcohol consumption as well as a female Loyola Marymount University student who was in serious condition after falling off a table at a party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Greek row · USC Student Affairs implemented changes to the Greek community that went into effect immediately. Sororities and fraternities can only host registered events between Friday at 3 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
“With regard to the case of a student from Loyola Marymount University injured at an unregistered party, the university has placed the chapter where the injury occurred on immediate social probation,” the statement said. “Social events at the chapter will be prohibited until this matter is resolved.  Student Affairs is in communication with the chapter’s national office to coordinate the response and possible disciplinary action.”
Carry also said that the case will be investigated by the Office of Student Judicial and Community Standards.
Four of the eight transports occurred on The Row, with another two occurring within two blocks, according to Dept. of Public Safety incident logs. An average of four people have been transported from The Row to a hospital each week.
An email from Interfraternity Council Executive Vice President Carlos Portela to fraternity presidents also said that the university’s “patience was running low” because of a high number of alcohol-related incidents.
Neither LAPD nor DPS Captain David Carlisle could disclose the name of the woman who fell. DPS also could not disclose the status of her health.
LAPD is currently investigating the incident.
“It is unfortunate to say this,” Portela wrote in the email, “but any sense of self-governance we were trying to keep up is no longer viable since this stance has come directly from the Student Affairs office.”
Portela wrote the sanctions will continue “indefinitely” and that he did not expect the restrictions to be lifted by Oct. 31.
President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Oliver Mittelstaedt declined to comment other than to say “our thoughts and prayers are with [the woman], her family and her friends as she recovers.”
The sanctions come after a recent increase in LAPD monitoring on The Row this semester.
Students in Greek life were told they were not allowed to comment on Row activities.
Annalise Mantz, Daniel Rothberg and Isabella Sayyah contributed to this report.
Updated at 8:55 p.m.: This post has been updated to include a statement from Vice Provost for Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry.
USC Risk Management 10.14.13

The Row is now dead. But the poor community members on Menlo will now be violated. We shall be ready for you.  Bring it!
To the above comments….Obviously the poem above was meant to be amusing and is no way an honest reflection of what fraternities think is acceptable behavior
Please clarify this ambiguous line, “Students in Greek life were told they were not allowed to comment on Row activities.” Told by whom? Comment to whom? Under threat of what consequences?
Dr. Grey Goose, you win.
Why punish the entire row for other houses mistakes? What about the houses who take an active stance on risk management? Is this fair to them? What’s stopping them from just not caring now that they know there is no PERSONAL accountability by the university and that they will be reprimanded whether or not they actually did anything wrong? Really disappointed in the University. You’re only ENCOURAGING this type of behavior with these blind, generalized punishments.
Uhhhh USC is a party school.  Not a a serious school.
very well written
How Nikias Stole Thursday
	by Dr. Grey Goose
Every Bro Down on 28th St Liked Raging a lot…
But Nikias, Who lived just south of The Row, Did NOT!
Nikias hated Raging! The whole Raging season!
Now, please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasn’t screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his drinking shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all,
May have been that his liver was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason, His liver or his shoes,
He stood there on Thursday Night Eve, hating those who drink brews,
Staring down from his office with a sour, sober frown,
At the black lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Bro down on The Row beneath,
Was busy now, preparing for the end of the week.
“And they’re stocking up on Prestige!” he snarled with a sneer,
“Tomorrow is Thursday! It’s practically here!”
Then he growled, with his President fingers nervously drumming,
“I MUST find some way to stop Thursday night from coming!”
For Tomorrow, he knew, all the USC girls and boys,
Would begin drinking bright and early. Their Thursday night they’d enjoy!
And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
Noise! Noise! Noise!
That’s one thing he hated! The NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Bros, young and old, would sit down to drink.
And they’d drink! And they’d drink! And they’d DRINK!
DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!
They would DRINK Prestige, and throw up in a New North sink.
Which was something Nikias couldn’t stand in the least!
And THEN They’d do something He liked least of all!
Every Bro down on The Row, the tall and the small,
Would stand close together, with house music sets playing.
They’d drink hand-in-hand. And the Bros would start raging!
They’d rage! And they’d rage! And they’d RAGE!
RAGE! RAGE! RAGE!
And the more Nikias thought of this Row ThursdayNightThing,
The more Nikias thought, “I must stop this whole thing!”
“Why, for three years I’ve put up with it now!”
“I MUST stop this Thursday from coming! But HOW?”
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
NIKIAS GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
“I know just what to do!” NIKIAS laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick white visor and a coat.
And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Nikias trick!”
“With this white coat and this visor, I look just like Lane Kiff!”
“All I need is a Row sexual assault…” Nikias looked around.
But, since Row sexual assaults are rare, there were none to be found.
Did that stop the old Nikias? No! Nikias simply said,
“I can’t find a sexual assault, but a drunk girl at SAE fell and hit her head!”
So he called his police squad, DPS. Then he took some DPS bikes,
On his map he drew X’s of all the frats they would strike.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
On a ramshackle Chariot And on he hopped, old C.L. Max.
Then Nikias said, “Giddap!” And the Chariot started down,
Toward the homes where the Bros Lay asnooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. 8balls of snow filled the air.
All the Bros were all dreaming sweet frat dreams without care.
When he came to the first little house on the square.
“This is stop number one,” the old C.L. Max hissed,
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
But, if pledges could do it, then so could Nikias.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Where the 30 racks of Natty Light all sat in a row.
“These 30 racks,” he grinned, “are the first things to go!”
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every beverage!
Slap bags! And handles! Andre! Keystone Light!
Vodka! Whiskey! Tequila! Oh my, what a sight!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then Nikias, very nimbly,
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the jello shots!
He took the jello syringes! He took the whole lot!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that C.L. Max even took their last dab of hash!
Then he stuffed all the alcohol up the chimney, what a sleuth.
“And NOW!” grinned Nikias, “I will stuff up the DJ booth!”
And the Grinch grabbed the DJ booth, and he started to shove,
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a freshman bro!
Little Johnny “Turn Down for What” Smith, fresh off his first line of blow.
The Grinch had been caught by this fraternity pledge,
Who’d come downstairs looking for more snow.
He stared at Nikias and said, “President, why,”
“Why are you taking our fun away? WHY?”
But, you know, that old C.L. Max was so smart and so slick,
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
“Why, my young scholar,” USC’s President said,
“If you keep partying like this you will surely end up dead!”
“So I’m taking it all back to Ralph’s, let me be clear.”
“I’m acting in your best interest. USC is no place to drink beer.”
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted his head,
And he got him some textbooks and he sent him to bed.
And when Johnny went to bed with his books,
C.L. Max went to the chimney with all the alcohol he took!
Then the last thing he grabbed was the freedom to rage!
Even for those who are of legal age.
And the one speck of alcohol That he left in the house,
Wouldn’t provide a solid buzz for even a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other frat houses
Leaving alcohol Much too small For even the other frat mouses!
It was quarter past dawn… All the Bros, still a-bed,
dreaming of Row Sluts giving good head,
He packed it up, all their illegal goods! The yayo! The alcohol!
The brownies! And the dabs! The Xanax! The Adderall!
Seven floors up! Up the side of Parking Structure A,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
“PoohPooh to the Bros!” he was Nikias-ishly humming.
“They’re finding out now that no Thursday night parties are coming!”
“They’re just waking up! I know just what they’ll do!”
“Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
Then the Bros down on 28th St will all cry BooHoo!”
“That’s a noise,” grinned Nikias, “That I simply MUST hear!”
So he paused. And Nikias put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over The Row.
It started in low. Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasn’t sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!
It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at 28th Street! Nikias popped his eyes!
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Every Bro down on The Row, the tall and the small,
Was partying! Without any regard for the rules at all!
He HADN’T stopped Thursday night from coming! IT CAME!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!
And Nikias, with his Nikias-feet ice-cold on The Row,
Stood puzzling and puzzling: “How could it be so?”
“It came without vodka! It came without Sailor Jerry!”
“It came without Absolut, Bacardi, and Smirnoff Berry!”
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Then Nikias thought of something he hadn’t before!
“Maybe Thursday night,” he thought, “doesn’t have to be such a bore.”
“Maybe Thursday night…perhaps…means a little bit more!”
And what happened then? Well…on The Row they say,
That Nikias’s liver went into overdrive that day!
And the minute his liver didn’t feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,
And he brought back the alcohol! The Row let out a cheer!
And he, HE HIMSELF! C.L Max shotgunned the first beer!
While a mostly entertaining take on the university’s response to row activities, “How Nikias Stole Thursday” also reflects the self-indulgent, destructive and de-humanizing attitude of frat brat mentality. Do you really believe your parents are spending tens of thousands of dollars on your privileged education so you can elevate partying to an art form?
No, this is NOT what parents are paying for.  After you graduate and are “living on your own dime…”
First off, I am in a fraternity and my parents do not pay for my education unlike yourself.  I work every single day and look to thursday night events and weekends as a source to “blow off steam”  you say self-indulgent, yet do not realize that every human being is self indulgent.  You say frat brat yet i work 12 hour days to sustain my habits and retain a 3.85, so please think before you decide to speak generally about something which you are clearly not knowledgeable in.  Doing so is unfair and is similar to what people have done throughout history as a means to persecute groups of people unfairly.
Blowing of steam…. Whatever you want to call it bro.
This largely amusing, but sexual assaults are NOT rare on the row. They in fact happen quite often. Not reported =/= that they didn’t happen.
Dude…several lines of your “poetry” actually SUPPORT these harsh sanctions (which is upsetting to me personally as a fellow RAGER!!)
For example:
“All I need is a Row sexual assault…” Nikias looked around.
 But, since Row sexual assaults are rare, there were none to be found”
You really think that USC’s president needs to LOOK for sexual assault as an excuse to stop our partying? Sexual assault occurs VERY regularly on the row. If you deny that, you’re either ignorant, or you are among the overly hormonal, impulse-driven little frat boys unable to distinguish “blackout drunk human being” from “viable sex partner.” Problem is a lot of you just DON’T know how to handle your liquor around hot girls. If you could, then maybe Nikias could let you #party #rage #DRINKDRINKDRINK to your heart’s content and liver’s dismay.  
Another segment from your piece:
“He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
“Why, my young scholar,” USC’s President said,
“If you keep partying like this you will surely end up dead!”
Honestly it happens. A good friend of mine from high school at another college died from alcohol intoxication a few weeks ago. Literally she just took too many shots, no drugs or anything, and she was one of those girls who never puked or seemed too drunk. Obviously most of us aren’t going to die from partying, but with the amount of transports to the HOSPITAL that we’ve had on a WEEKLY basis, it’s not really too off-base for USC to be worrying about kids dying here.
Then there’s this :
“It was quarter past dawn… All the Bros, still a-bed
dreaming of Row Sluts giving good head”
honestly guys…don’t apologize for partying. Apologize for your abhorrent attitudes toward women and human life. The girl who hit her head? Instead of including that mockingly in a poem, maybe consider the possible brain damage she and her family are dealing with, and acknowledge that it was a f**cking tragedy.
People like YOU are the reason why USC doesn’t want us to rage anymore. Get it together and GROW UP.
when you talk about “row sluts giving good head”, that’s what makes me happy the row is shut down. people like you and people who perpetrate this kind of behavior make me really disappointed in my school. if you’re having fun partying, that’s great. but don’t bring in all this misogynistic, reprehensible, “frat bro” behavior. especially when sexual assaults are so common. rethink yourself.
Only one review rings resoundingly through the resplendent valleys of Los Angeles:
“THE GOOSE IS LOOSE!”
Dr. Goose has, once again, emerged triumphant in the rap battle of poetry slam that is Row Politics at Southern California’s University. 
While Goose has faced harsh, inevitable criticism from humorless has-beens in the making, his artwork speaks for itself. 
Seriously though:
The dangers of the row are exactly that, predictable dangers that all members of these institutions agree to brave when they join said institution.  
For women: if you’re afraid that the row’s atmosphere may not be conducive to your lifestyle choices or goals, you could probably find a party in which you’re more interested by browsing through your ‘Contacts’ or LITERALLY on the walk from the row to campus.  Avoid it. If it’s such a toxic environment, then why are so many people there every Thursday through Saturday night? Could it be that they haven’t read your posts on this wall? Could it be they haven’t had the world illuminated properly by you? Or could it be that your opinions on the row are not fully formed, that you think sexual assault happens rampantly on the row because you heard from a friend who heard from a friend that that was the truth. I’m sure you’ve never actually been on the row if you’re throwing these blanket statements around so haphazardly. 
And just so you can understand exactly where I’m coming from, I’m a member of a fraternity house, and I find it quite insulting that you immediately eliminate any sense of individuality or accountability by making us all into one creature.  
The problem with this rationale is that you believe sexual assault to be something that happens EXCLUSIVELY on the row.  Would it not be just as ignorant if I were to say that, because most of the people who propagate school shootings at Universities spend long days alone in their dorm rooms, silently trying to have their political agendas heard on the internet, that EVERYONE who spends time posting their opinion on the internet is A SCHOOL SHOOTER (INCLUDING YOU!)? No, because that would be ILLOGICAL, much like the argument that a satirical poem in any way indicates an actual, real life level of toxicity on 28th street.
i obviously don’t think all sexual assaults happen on the row. the row itself is not the problem. misogynistic attitudes, as shown by that poem (yes i know it’s a joke) is what i find troubling. i just don’t think it’s right to make light of serious things like rape, assault, or this girl who now has possible brain damage.
rape happens very often. it’s not specifically a USC problem, but a college campus problem and a world problem. i’m sorry if you would prefer to ignore that fact.
but i think we at USC can do a better job of not contributing to these frat boy stereotypes. starting with not celebrating that poem.
Thank you for an actually ethically journalistic piece on this matter.
