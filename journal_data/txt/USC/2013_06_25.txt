When in doubt, always rap to the tune of Fresh Prince of Bel Air during an alien invasion. It’s just one takeaway from a hilarious musical version of the 1996 sci-fi summer action film, Independence Day, reimagined by 30 Minute Musicals at The Celebration Theatre as part of the 2013 Hollywood Fringe Festival. The musical is produced by Secondline Productions, the company behind a variety of other 30 minute musical versions of classic films, such as Jurassic Park, Top Gun and Home Alone.

Director, producer and writer Brooke Seguin infuses the story with upbeat musical numbers, well-worded satire and dancing The cast performs with high energy, poking fun at the diverse set of original characters from the film with spot-on impressions and exaggerations.
“We like to keep it real, interactive and in your face,” Seguin said.
The production is unique in that it is brilliantly simple. Staged in an intimate theatre that seats just 64 people, there are no sets or orchestra, just a live band in the background. Audience members  get up close and personal with performers, who enter and exit the stage hrough the theatre’s doors. Rather than feeling like mere onlookers, the audience feels follows the same journey as the characters.
Moreover, by using simple props such as baby dolls for characters’ children and a handmade paper moon, the production proves that simplicity not only creates more space for originality; It produces a sense of charm.
One of the most memorable musical numbers was “Blastronaut,” as Captain Steven Hiller (Tommy Hobson) fervently pays homage to black astronauts or what he calls, “blastronauts.” It is a hilarious, overdramatic gospel performance with cast members entering in choir gowns, holding pictures of historical black astronauts. During the number, Captain Hiller’s wife, Jasmine (Sixx Carter), an exotic dancer, puts the audience in stitches with her sexy moves and her strange obsession with dolphins.
Michael Bernardi’s impressions of Jeff Goldblum, who played David Levinson in the film, are spot-on. Bernardi perfected the actor’s awkward mannerisms with expert twitches and blinks. Levinson’s father, Julius, is played by the show’s director, producer and writer herself, who pulls off the Jewish, cigar-wielding character fashionably well.
Activist, writer and musician Chaz Bono stars as none other than President Thomas J. Whitmore, whose leadership helps take down the aliens, ultimately bringing about victory. The former Dancing with the Stars contestant surely indulges in his new musical element, delivering a strong performance as the core leader of the group.
Bono’s performance, in addition to dancing aliens that almost look like green Barneys and amusing space battles prove that elaborate props, sets and costumes are not necessary to keep audience members afloat and engaged. Rather, the production is simple, short and satisfying, rendering the half-hour-long musical very enjoyable.
“Everyone wants everything quick, fast,” Seguin asid. “They don’t want intermission and they want to laugh,” Seguin said.
And surely, simple and short does it. “It’s fast, it’s fun,” the cast sings at the opening of the show. People have busy lives and have places to be. Many do not have time to sit and watch a two-hour movie or musical. Thus, Seguin’s 30-minute musical brings in innovative and comedic performances within a reasonable time frame that is satisfying and fresh. Audience members have the opportunity to engage with the arts on a whole other level.
30 Minute Musical: Independence Day is just wrapping up production with two performances left on June 26 and 30. Tickets are $10. Up next for Secondline Productions is 30 Minute Musical: Hook, coming in August.
This is a great show, and the theatre space and simple props work perfectly.  A fantastic example of how ‘less is more’!

Bosnian Rainbows. The name recalls every other independent collaboration of musicians that decided to pick up instruments and brave the daunting world that is the music industry. It even smacks of hipster-dom by amalgamating two disparate words and mashing them to form something edgy or perhaps ironic.

It turns out that this collaboration — which features experienced musicians from entirely unique realms — is one with potential. On their eponymous album, Bosnian Rainbows isn’t trying to recreate an existing sound or rebel against music by inventing a new genre. Instead, it carries out an  experiment that demonstrates the result of two powerhouse musicians colliding and compromising in the attempt of forming a cohesive album. Bosnian Rainbows has potential and showcases multiple strengths throughout, but for no truly obvious reason, the album seems to fall just short.
The four-piece act hails from El Paso, Texas, and has been a project in the making for some time now. Bosnian Rainbows gets its roots from, most notably, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, the former guitarist of The Mars Volta and At The Drive-In. Rodriguez-Lopez, often described as a dynamic and dictatorial band leader, teamed up with Teri Gender Bender (born Teresa Suarez) of the garage-punk band Le Butcherettes. The result is a tortured, alternative rock sound that borrows heavily from electro-synth and psychedelic influences.
Undeniably, Gender Bender is the common thread throughout the album, weaving her passion, power and even softness through each track. She’s easily the standout on each track despite the effort from the guitar, keyboards and drums that support her. Her voice is shrill and piercing yet ghostly, as though she’s cooing but wielding a sharp knife. The vocals cut easily through the instrumentation, sometimes in a way that’s transcendental but just as often sending a pang of unease through the ear. She evokes the ’80s, channeling Blondie at times and Joan Jett at others. She even touches on Heart.
The album begins with a punch in “Eli,” a track that starts off humming eerily before churning into a perpetual crescendo that features Gender Bender’s signature wail amid a creeping synth line and darker guitar riff. The sound is initially a bit jarring; the synth is poppy like The Killers, the guitar would fit in with any of the European alt-rock that’s been migrating westward and Gender Bender is the punk puzzle piece that’s trying to fit in between.
As the album progresses, however, the signature sound created by these three distinct aspects starts to develop. Listeners need to let the album steep before it can be properly absorbed. “Turtle Neck” slows down the pace of the album and becomes a psychedelic rock anthem. The music sways and the vocals soothe — the entire track oozes and flows the way a lava lamp might. It almost makes you forget that Gender Bender is singing, “I don’t know, Turtle Neck, where you’ve been all my life.”
And it’s not just in “Turtle Neck” that the lyrics demonstrate confusing babble. In fact, they can be laughable. Despite its looming sound, on the first track, Gender Bender sings, “Eli, your eyes are black and white,” and proceeds to implore, “Why do you smile at me?” so incessantly that listeners are constantly waiting — even begging — for Eli to respond.
Though the sound is alluring and intriguing — a mix of sounds that haven’t been properly explored since the glory days of rock ‘n’ roll — the album can often feel like it’s being pulled in separate directions. Whether this is because of the clashing genres or two former band leaders that are learning to loosen their grip is impossible to tell. Regardless, many of the songs on the album begin in one direction and then completely transform into something different halfway through. Sometimes these tracks make a full circle, returning to their original sound, but often they’re content to be two different ideas that play tag team.
One of these dissonant tracks is “The Eye Fell In Love.” The vocals start out sultry yet assertive as a popping synth beat and a quivering guitar start to establish a beat in the background. The track seems to be following the trajectory of those that came before it and we’re following along as we learn all the letters of the alphabet that “The Eye” fell in love with when suddenly the instrumentation drops off. The song sails into an interlude before picking up the pace while Gender Bender delves into “oohs” and moans before the song abruptly ends.
Despite its inconsistencies, the album is an experience. It’s unafraid and bold, loud and brave with vocals and instruments that fight to be heard (although they often don’t need to try quite so hard). Bosnian Rainbows definitely taps into a nostalgic sound that’s a welcome change of pace from the patterns that up-and-coming musicians often fall into and it’s refreshing. And, with all the psychedelic influence, the name turns out to be pretty apt after all.

The La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museum
Amidst the hustle and bustle of urban L.A. lies a captivating piece of ancient history — with more than 3.5 million fossils, the La Brea Tar Pits feature the most extensive collection of extinct Ice Age plants and animals in the world. This option might be a bit less glamorous than the other summer suggestions, but it is no less entertaining.
The park is home to multiple bubbling asphalt seeps, the largest of which is filled with life-size statues of mammoths and mastodons. Its Plesitocene garden features plants and flowers that allow guests to get a glimpse of what the earth looked like during the last Ice Age. Additionally, visitors who stop by Project 23 can watch an ongoing excavation, where new fossils are found every day. The Page Museum displays the fossils that have been found at the park over the years, including those of camels, ground sloths, dire wolves, mammoths and saber-toothed cats, to name a few. The museum also features a peaceful atrium full of gingko trees and ferns.
The Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits is located at 5801 Wilshire Blvd. and is open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $12 for the public and $9 for students with I.D. There is no restaurant on-site, but check out Callender’s Grill, The Counter or Mixt Greens for delicious meals nearby. Parking is $7 on weekends and $9 during the week with $2 returned upon exit with validation from the museum, but street parking is also available nearby. Check out tarpits.org for more information.

In the minds of hip-hop aficionados, up-and-coming rapper J. Cole’s decision to move up the release date of his sophomore album Born Sinner to the same day as Kanye West’s highly anticipated Yeezus was tantamount to career suicide. Hip-hop is an unusually competitive musical genre that is artistically governed by the collision of personas and egos — even if, at times, those collisions are inadvertent.
Work at it · J. Cole enjoyed commercial success with “Work Out” from his debut album, but has amassed critical acclaim for his newest album. – Courtesty of Creative Commons
These collisions and their marketing machinations also manifest in the seemingly all-important realm of first-week album sales. In moving up the release date of his album to June 18, Cole was not attempting to challenge West directly, but to make a bold statement of his arrival as an artist, and the rapper’s viability to compete with established artists such as West.
It was a risky move on the part of Cole because his major label debut, 2011’s Cole World: The Sideline Story, was a false start. An uninspired mélange of attempted radio-friendly singles and incongruous production, the album showed promise but ultimately failed to deliver on the hype generated by Cole’s more highly touted mixtape efforts, including 2009’s The Warm Up and 2010’s Friday Night Lights. If Born Sinner had amounted to simply Sideline Story II, the predictions of career suicide would have read more like prophecy.
Instead, the Roc Nation signee returns to the formula that made his mixtapes so famous — an uncanny knack for tight, sample-heavy production paired with a fierce lyrical delivery dripping with the hunger of a rapper on the cusp of success. Cole takes these elements and glosses the proceedings with a polish worthy of a studio release.
“Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Cole,” barks the Fayetteville, North Carolina native, channeling the words of his boss and mentor Jay-Z. It’s the last line from the album’s intro “Villuminati,” in which a tempest of strings is tamed by thumping bass drum kicks and a string bass rendition of the opening of DJ E-Z Rock and Rob Base’s “It Takes Two.” The production is as sweeping and epic as anything in hip-hop since Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d. city.
The intro sets a darker tone for the album — a contrast to the brighter, pop-appealing efforts off Sideline Story like the single “Work Out.” While the catchy Paula Abdul-sampling affair led to Cole’s most successful single to date, the response to the song’s pop-friendly affectations was less appreciated in hip-hop purist’s circles.
One such critic was hip-hop legend Nas, whose acerbic reaction to Cole’s pop-friendly compromise was the subject of highlight track “Let Nas Down.” A jazzy, contorting alto saxophone refrain lays effortlessly over boom-bap drums as Cole recalls hearing the news of his idol’s disapproval: “Dion [producer No I.D.] called me when it dropped sounded sad but sincere / Told me ‘Nas heard your single and he hate that sh-t’ / Said ‘You the one yo, why you make that sh-t?’”
As if in response to the criticism, the singles on Born Sinner showcase Cole’s potential to craft thought-provoking singles with wider appeal, as opposed to his previous painful pop-pandering acrobatics. “Power Trip” and “Crooked Smile” are relatively complex treatments of love; the former is a man’s reconciliation with his moral shortcomings on account of his feelings for a woman, and the latter is an uplifting track that urges listeners to love themselves and celebrate their individuality.
The lyrical content of Born Sinner sees Cole attempt to reconcile the persona of a stereotypically successful rapper with deeply rooted Christian conceptions of personal morality. This dichotomy often manifests in his interactions with the familiar rap archetypes — for instance, the rejection of the silver-tongued stripper in “She Knows,” or justifying the purchase of a blinged-out Jesus chain in “Chaining Day.”
Many of these tracks dually function as metaphors for his relationship with his craft: how the seductive allure of fame and material wealth (in the form of becoming a radio-friendly hit-maker) is ultimately outweighed by a greater need to make music that is true to his original vision. Cole is the ultimate hip-hop purist, insofar that he equates the honesty of his musical expressions to a moral ideal. In these respects, Born Sinner seems almost desperate to prove Cole hasn’t sold out.
The first week tallies are in: according to Hits Daily Double, Yeezus sold 328,800 units, edging out Born Sinner, which had 297,922. The stakes were decidedly lower than in 2007, but the statement is clear: that despite Kanye’s genre-challenging genius and overwhelming celebrity hype, sometimes it’s the comfort of honest, well-crafted music of albums like Born Sinner that are capable of generating just as much anticipation. The tally at the very least confirms that J. Cole is more than just a one-and-done, so hip-hop fans should take comfort in the fact that Born Sinner is selling — and not selling out.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, June 19, and Monday, June 24. 
Crimes against a person
At 1:13 P.m. on June 24, a faculty member reported that, on June 19, a non-USC male claimed that she ran over his foot while exiting the University Village parking lot in her vehicle. She said he demanded that she give him money for medical expenses, and the faculty member complied, but she was not convinced that she did actually run over the male’s foot. She told DPS that she believes she might have been the victim of a scam. The faculty member did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to interview the male.
Crimes against property
At 2:16 p.m. on June 21, it was reported that suspect climbed through an unsecured bathroom window in a residence on 30th street to gain entry. The suspect removed jewelry, an iPod and an iPod player.
At 11:16 p.m. on June 20, a student in the Mardette Apartments on Portland Avenue reported that her roommate, also a student, entered her bedroom without permission and removed a candy bar. The reporting student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter, but she requested a report for documentation purposes because of on-going problems with her roommate.
At 3:10 p.m. on June 19, DPS officers monitoring surveillance cameras observed a suspect smash the front passenger side window of a vehicle parked near 30th and Figueroa streets and remove unidentified property from the front seat. Additional officers responded to the scene and detained the suspect along with a second suspect who was determined to have been acting as a lookout. Both suspects were then arrested and transported to 77th Street station for booking.
At 12:43 p.m. on June 19, a non-USC male reported that he left his girlfriend inside his parked vehicle while he serviced an ATM near Jefferson Boulevard and Catalina Street and when he returned, his wallet and a phone had been removed from the vehicle and she was gone.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:02 p.m. on June 24, DPS officers detained two suspects for trespassing near West Washington Boulevard and a subsequent check of their names revealed that one of them had an outstanding warrant. The suspect was arrested and transported to 77th Street station for booking.  The second suspect was advised against trespassing on university property and released.
At 4:43 a.m. on June 24, DPS officers on routine patrol were directed by a witness to a fire in a trash dumpster near Adams Boulevard and Figueroa Street. The officers used fire extinguishers, but the dumpster’s contents continued to smolder. LAFD was requested and Unit #15 finished putting out the fire.
At 7:10 p.m. on June 23, a student’s wallet was found at a gas station and turned in to DPS Lost & Found.
At 5:14 p.m. on June 22, a faculty member reported that a coworker was nearly struck by an unopened beer can that was thrown onto the roof of Phi Gamma Delta. No one witnessed the can being thrown and no suspects were located.
at 3:16 a.m. on June 22, DPS officers responded to a security guard who reported that he was verbally assaulted by a suspect inside the lobby of  Icon Plaza.  The suspect left the lobby prior to the officers’ arrival and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the building.
Great Week DT!  Thanks for the laughs
I love the girl that called DPS over the missing candy bar.   The girlfriend that disappears with the guys wallet and phone is also a classic.   People should know it rains full beer cans on 28th street all the time….

Students in the School of Cinematic Arts’ Interactive Media and Games Division expressed excitement over the new building, which publicly opened last week.
Featured attraction · The School of Cinematic Arts’ Interactive Media and Games Division includes video game design, which has been ranked No. 1 in the U.S. by the Princeton Review and U.S. and World News Report. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
“I think the new building is great for the interactive department,” said Bryan Zhang, an interactive media MFA student. “All of the spaces are new and clean and it’s got some nice computer labs.”
The school celebrated the opening of the building by hosting a panel discussion on June 12 featuring George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment Business.
The building will house SCA’s Interactive Media and Games Division. Students in the program create digital media scholarship, media art and games. The building features technology including a 3-D printer, industry-standard game testing rooms, motion detectors and touch-screen monitors.
“Personally, I would not expect a lot of the cool stuff they have in here to be out in the industry yet,” Zhang said, “so I think it’s cool that we have it here.”
School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley said the building’s technology will give USC students in the program a unique advantage.
“The School of Cinematic Arts is both industry-facing and future-focused,” Daley said. “The new Interactive Media Building allows our students to work in the same kind of cutting-edge facilities as the professionals, which makes them uniquely prepared for the entertainment industry of the 21st century and access to the latest, best technology allows our students and faculty to fully realize their storytelling vision, even as they imagine what the next technological breakthrough could be.”
The George Lucas Foundation donated $45 million of the $50 million needed to build the facility, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Walter Lee Williams, a former professor added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List for child sex crimes, was indicted June 19 in Los Angeles after being apprehended June 18 in eastern Mexico.
Williams was found in the Caribbean town of Playa del Carmen in the state of Quintana Roo. Authorities said he was not living under an assumed name.
The FBI said authorities have identified at least 10 victims between the ages of 9 and 17, all of whom are overseas.
Williams traveled extensively, and many of his victims are said to be citizens of developing countries. USC previously listed Williams as an expert on Belize, Cambodia, China, Laos, Malaysia and Mexico.
According to the Los Angeles Times, he fled Los Angeles in 2011 after an adult student told the Los Angeles Police Department that Williams was allegedly looking for minors to have sex with online. When Williams returned from a trip to the Philippines, the FBI seized his computer, which had evidence of sex crimes with minors.
There is currently no evidence that any illegal activity took place on campus.
As an academic, Williams was noted for his work on sexuality in Native American communities.
In addition, Williams started the Gay and Lesbian Review in 1996 and served as President of the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, helping to bring them to campus. During his time at USC, Williams served as an adviser for several student organizations, including the Lambda Grads, Shades of Troy and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Assembly.

The California Science Center Board of Directors unanimously approved a term sheet to give USC control of the lease through the end of 2111 after several meetings plagued with debate over control of parking lots.
Deliberation · More than 100 people came to support or oppose the lease terms agreement, which was approved unanimously. – Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
 
The primary difference between the approved terms and previous ones is that the university will make less money from parking spaces. The Exposition Park manager will work with USC to coordinate events and parking for events.
The approved lease stipulates that on game days, at least 600 spaces be reserved for museums visitors, that the Science Center receive at least $25 per space sold and that buses must be allowed to drop off museum patrons until three hours before a large event. The board of directors estimated that, under the previous agreement, the Exposition Park Improvement Fund that benefits from such parking payments would see revenue drop between $80,000 and $200,000 annually.
More than 100 people attended the meeting, with the crowd spilling out of the Loker Conference Center at one point. Many, especially community members affiliated with the USC Family of Schools, supported the new terms.
Some voiced discontent with the negotiated terms, including Pastor Leroy Sheppard of the Son Shine Bible Church on Century Boulevard and Western Avenue, who said the agreement does not benefit tax payers, and President of the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce Armen Ross. Some said the addition of the space shuttle Endeavor at the Science Center had brought more people to the museum, which meant it required more parking spaces in return.
The Board did not convene a closed session to discuss public comments before voting. Board member Billie Greer stressed the openness of the deliberations.
“Through rational and reasonable discussion … we have an agreement that meets the needs of all the museums,” Greer said. “This is important. These museums are treasures of the state, of the nation and of the world.”
Representatives of the university, the governor’s office and the museums in and around Exposition Park negotiated the terms and met more than two dozen times since March. The approved term sheet amends three contracts negotiated and released in December 2012: a nondisturbance agreement, a Coliseum lease option and a sports arena lease option.
Under the terms, USC assumes all of the Coliseum Commission’s financial obligations to the Science Center under the existing leases for the Coliseum and arena. USC will pay at least $51 million to the Science Center by 2054, and the rent can be adjusted to reflect changes in property value in 2055 if USC renews the lease, because USC plans to add about $100 million in renovations by then.
Some language from the university and those representing the museum’s interests pointed to the contentiousness over the lease agreement.
Last week, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden sent a statement through the USC Trojan athletics website urging fans to attend the meeting.
“We believe we have reached a reasonable deal that benefits all parties involved,” Haden wrote. “Despite what you may have read in the Los Angeles Times or heard from misinformed members of the public, this deal does not in any way hurt the museums in Exposition Park and in fact helps solve major financial problems looming over the Science Center should the deal not be approved.”
James R. Gilson, vice president and general counsel for the Natural History Museum, emphasized that hard work and communication will be required of all parties to see the agreement through.
Tom Sayles, USC’s senior vice president of university relations, appeared somewhat dour, but said he was pleased with the negotiations overall.
“Because of the transparent and open process, we were able to hear out all parties and we ended up with an agreement that was fair to all,” Sayles said. “We had a collaborative process.”

If Congress fails to reach a compromise by July 1, more than seven million college students will see their federally subsidized student loan interest rates double. With less than a week to go, Congress must act now and pass a bill that doesn’t tie interest rates to the market and keeps them at 3.4 percent. The House and Senate should support any one of the short-term proposals currently available  that will extend low interest rates for subsidized student loans, allowing themselves more time to pass long-term education reform.
Advocates of variable rates that fluctuate depending on market performance are shortsighted. Sure, the Federal Reserve’s 0.75 percent discount rate to banks is attractive now, but as the economy recovers, that figure will rise and leave students vulnerable to rate spikes. A dynamic interest rate would have parents and students guessing whether they can afford to take out loans and undermine Congress’ overall goal of increasing students’ access to higher education.
Setting loans to market rates would allow the government to profit at the expense of students as well. Minnesota Rep. John Kline’s Smarter Solutions for Students Act proposal illustrates how market-based interest rates are a smarter solution — for the government, that is, not students. According to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates, the United States would save $3.7 billion by following Kline’s variable-rate bill. However, the $3.7 billion saved would go toward reducing the national deficit, effectively asking students to pay for a deficit they didn’t create and removing funds that would have otherwise been invested in students’ educations.
Current levels of student debt are already at a record high of more than $1.1 trillion. According to Van Jones, president and founder of policy, economics and media think tank Rebuild the Dream, student debt is so high that it’s become a substantial hindrance to economic recovery.
“[Student debt] is preventing young people from buying homes and starting businesses,” Jones wrote in a CNN column.
A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York confirms that. The Fed found in April that 30-year-olds with student loans were less likely to have debts from big-ticket purchases such as home mortgages than 30-year-olds without student loans. Similar trends appear among 25-year-olds and auto loans as well.
Increasing interest rates on student loans would further depress the economy. What’s needed is a long-term solution, but market-based interest rates is not the way. Until Congress finds a better solution, a host of short-term proposals are available to give Congress more time without endangering students’ futures.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bill sets rates at 0.75 percent for one year so as to let students borrow at the same rate banks do. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand proposes allowing existing loans to be refinanced at today’s low rates. The Student Loan Fairness Act from Rep. Karen Bass permanently caps all federal loans at 3.4 percent and allows eligible borrowers to convert private loans into federal direct loans.
Even Sen. Jack Reed and Sen. Tom Harkin’s modest proposal, which simply extends the current 3.4 percent rate for two years by closing a few tax loopholes, is viable. But Congress must stop squabbling and act now before the July 1 deadline closes in.

Hassan Rouhani, the president-elect of Iran, has been hailed internationally as the moderate Iran needs to repair its relationship with the West, fix the failing Iranian economy and curb the political power of the clerical elites within the Persian nation.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
They’re wrong.
Rouhani, after his inauguration in August, will inherit a theocracy headed toward amassing nuclear capabilities. And unfortunately for Rouhani, there will be little he can do to stop this progression, because he does not actually wield much power in the government.
Michael Rubin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, put it best when he told the National Review that the president of Iran “has about as much sway … as a secretary of agriculture has over the Joint Chiefs of Staff.” And, last I checked, Tom Vilsack (that’s the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture) isn’t a household name.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields absolute power in the state, leads Iran. His decisions cannot be overturned by judicial or legislative review, even though those bodies do exist within Iran. Essentially, the supreme leader is unchecked in his ability to wield the power of the Iranian state. Thus, Rouhani will have about as much influence over Iranian programs as Vilsack does currently.
Therefore, on issues of Iran’s nuclear program, Rouhani will not be able to reform anything. Khamenei has stated time and again, according to the Anti-Defamation League, that Israel is a stain that must be wiped off the map, preferably with a nuclear weapon. With Khamenei’s level of vitriol and huge stockpiles of enriched uranium, according to this week’s issue of The Economist, Iran can develop a nuclear weapon at any time. Technically speaking, Iran has “breakout capability,” or the ability to rapidly enrich enough uranium to make a nuclear weapon.
This nuclear capability has not gone unopposed. Indeed, the West, led by the United States, has levied enormous sanctions on Iran. These sanctions, while not compelling the Iranian leaders to halt the program, have only hurt the populace, contributing to massive inflation and general economic malaise. On this problem as well, it is unlikely that Rouhani will be able to effect change. The U.S. and the West will only lower the sanctions against Iran if Iran gives up the nuclear program. Because Khamenei holds the keys to the nuclear program, he effectively holds the keys to the sanctions, and thus the economy as well.
Even if Rouhani had the ability to truly lead Iran, there is little evidence that he would move away from the extreme position currently endorsed by the Ayatollah. Rouhani might be branded a “moderate” by the media, but he is no moderate in the Western sense. Calling Rouhani a moderate, as Rubin notes, is like saying Attila the Hun is a moderate, when compared to Genghis Khan. The fact remains that Iran’s Guardian Council, which approves all candidates for the Presidential election, disqualified 98 percent of all candidates before the election. There is no way the Council will let through any actual moderates or anything close to resembling a liberal reformer.
Finally, there are significant roadblocks standing in the way of Rouhani and bringing actual change to Iran. In May 2011, international media outlets such as The New York Times reported that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had fallen into ill will with Khamenei after trying to move the country in a new direction. The Times was quick to point out that previous presidents who had clashed with the Ayatollah had seen their power undermined at every opportunity, and a gradual but severe fade from political relevancy and public life after they stepped down from the presidency. In time, Ahmadinejad fell back in line with the clerics in Tehran, and Iran has stayed on the same course toward nuclear armament and extremism since.
Should Rouhani attempt anything similar, the Ayatollah can also threaten to not back the new president in the elections four years from now. If the Ayatollah seriously backs another candidate, it is unlikely that Rouhani will be re-elected. Of course, the Guardian Council and the Ayatollah could prohibit this president from running again in the national elections, nipping any hopes for re-election in the bud.
The elections have shifted the focus away from the true sources of power within Iran. Without new clerical leadership, Iran will continue to head toward nuclear capability and an inevitable clash with the West.

It was not a banner year by any means for the USC baseball team, but one Trojan stood above the rest of the competition to earn First Team All-West Region honors for the 2013 season. Senior second baseman Adam Landecker was the bright spot on the 20-36 ballclub, putting up stellar numbers to close out his collegiate career.
Landecker, who hails from Calabasas High School in California, has been a cornerstone of the baseball program since his freshman season in 2010, playing in just one fewer game that year than in his 51-game campaign in his senior season.
Offensively, Landecker led the charge for the Trojans and was one of the best in the Pac-12 as well. His .351 batting average was enough to lead the USC lineup, and was the  second-highest mark in the Pac-12. The last time a Trojan batted over .350 was back in Landecker’s freshman season, when former teammate Ricky Oropesa hit .353. Landecker also drove in 25 runs, hit 18 doubles, one triple and two home runs in the year.
Landecker was just as impressive on the defensive side of things, using a slick glove and an accurate arm on his way to a .981 fielding percentage. His consistent presence at second base was critical for the right side of the Trojan infield, which went through a revolving door at first base for part of the season. With his performance in 2013, Landecker’s career fielding percentage improved to .968, a percentage he earned at multiple positions.
Landecker was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 21st round of the 2013 MLB first-year player draft, and is currently playing for the Gulf Coast Pirates, Pittsburgh’s rookie-ball affiliate. Landecker went 2-5 with a double, a triple and an RBI in his first game with Gulf Coast.
Over his 191-game Trojan career, Landecker posted a .311 batting average. Though primarily a table-setter, he drove in 68 runs in his collegiate career. His final Trojan stats include 30 doubles, 5 triples, three home runs and a solid on-base percentage of .394.
Landecker also received All-Pac-12 honorable mention honors for the 2013 season. He was also one of eight Pac-12 players to be named to the All-West Region first team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
You got that right. Not a banner year by the far reaches of the universe. Congrats to Landecker who the team
could have used five or six more of his play at bat and in the field. Now that the school from across town has
won the national title  what is Haden waiting for in finding a new head coach to get this program back to at
least respectability. It has become a disgrace since 2006 with the help of former AD Mike Garrett and presently
chair of the Athletic Dept. Patrick Haden .

Two USC men’s golfers, senior Sam Smith and freshman Yi Keun Chang, were named 2013 PING All-American honorable mention selections by the GCAA on Thursday. Being the team leaders in stroke average for the 2013 season, both were key players in getting the USC men’s golf team to the NCAA championships last year.

As a senior, Smith led the team in stroke average at 71.76 and was the Trojans’ top finisher for five consecutive events late in the season. During that stretch, he also got his first career win at the 2013 NCAA Pullman Regional. There, he finished 14 under par, shooting a 202 (62-64-76). His first two rounds established a new school record for the lowest score over 36 holes by any USC player. To round out Smith’s accomplishments, he also had nine top-20 finishes over the course of the season, the most on the team.
Chang, who finished the season with a stroke average of 71.78, had a team-best nine rounds in the 60s, including three rounds where he shot 66. Only a freshman, he had four top-10 finishes, a team high, including a win at the North Ranch Intercollegiate, where he finished with a two-under-par 211. In his collegiate debut, he finished fifth at the Pac-12 preview. Chang also had the best finish of any USC golfer at the NCAA championships with a 4-under 207, which was good enough for a tie for 16th place.
With Smith graduated, Chang poses a bright future for USC men’s golf as the team prepares for next spring.

Former USC running backs coach Todd McNair, the linchpin in the NCAA’s case against USC and Reggie Bush, wants to have his name cleared of any wrongdoing. But the NCAA is doing all it can to make sure that doesn’t happen.

The NCAA has been trying to keep 700 pages of documents concerning its investigation of USC and McNair under lock and key, while The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times have asked for the courts to disclose them to the public.
Last Wednesday, the NCAA argued that the documents should remain sealed, claiming that its investigation process would be compromised if the documents were made available to the public. The two major newspapers, meanwhile, referred to the First Amendment and California Rules of Court, arguing that “court records are presumptively open.”
A resolution between the two sides, either inside or outside of the courtroom, isn’t expected anytime soon.
When USC was punished in 2010 with a two-year postseason ban and lengthy scholarship reductions by the NCAA following alleged misconduct involving Bush’s recruitment, McNair was also banned from working for any NCAA school or contacting any potential recruits for one year. McNair hasn’t been able to find a job in football since he was punished by the NCAA.
The NCAA ruled that McNair had lied when he denied meeting Lloyd Lake, a wannabe sports agent who provided benefits to Bush. McNair appealed the decision and challenged the credibility of Lake, one of the NCAA’s key witnesses, but the NCAA appeals committee upheld the sanctions.
McNair then sued the NCAA in June 2011, seeking to recoup damages from supposed libel and slander, among a handful of other offenses.
Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller’s decision to rule in favor of McNair this past November when the NCAA sought to have McNair’s defamation claims dismissed seemed to be heavily influenced by the documents at issue, according to reports.
Shaller, a USC graduate, wrote in his decision that emails written by NCAA enforcement personnel related to McNair’s case “tend to show ill will or hatred” toward McNair.
One NCAA employee called McNair “a lying, morally bankrupt criminal … and a hypocrite of the highest order,” in one email referred to by Shaller in his decision.
Shaller also said that the actions of NCAA investigators were “malicious,” “over the top,” and demonstrated “a reckless disregard for the truth.”
The sanctions bestowed upon USC and McNair have already been roundly disparaged by some members of the sports media.
In December of 2011, before Shaller ruled in favor of McNair in the initial trial, ESPN Pac-12 reporter Ted Miller wrote, “It’s become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice … That’s the take of all clear-thinking people.”
If the documents, which also include interview and deposition transcripts, do give substantial evidence to the claim that the NCAA unfairly targeted McNair, it’ll be another recent black mark for the NCAA, which has also come under fire for botching its investigation of the University of Miami. In January, the NCAA had to temporarily halt its investigation of Miami after admitting it improperly obtained information to look into alleged violations by the Hurricanes’ football and men’s basketball programs.
For its part, USC has attempted to keep quiet and move on from the infamous sanctions. All traces of Bush were removed from Heritage Hall in 2010, and the Trojans are only sanctioned for one more season.
In his ruling last fall, Judge Shaller did note that McNair had “demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the defamation claim.”
Though the school has kept its distance from the McNair lawsuit, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden has intimated at various times that the school would revisit contesting the sanctions if new information came to light.
I don’t recall any allegations about improper recruitment.  The NCAA public report addressed institutional control, and ineligibility of student-athletes based on events that took place after enrollment.  This is an important distinction that warrants correction.
