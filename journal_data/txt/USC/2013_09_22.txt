The pair of wins improved the Trojans’ record to 10-0 on the season and advanced them to the winner’s bracket of the tournament on Sunday.
Against Diablo Valley, USC came out on top 18-5, going up 6-2 in the first period and never looking back. The Trojans never trailed against Diablo Valley and controlled every aspect of the game.
One of the early season trends for USC head coach Jovan Vavic’s team has been the constant rotation of his three goalkeepers: redshirt sophomore Aleck Ryner, senior James Clark and redshirt junior Paul Mitre. That trend continued against Diablo Valley, as the trio of goalies each played a near-equal amount of time and shut down the opposing attack.
In the second game, the Trojans faced one of the tournament’s surprise teams in the Pepperdine Waves, who earlier in the day upset the No. 7-ranked UC Irvine Anteaters.
The Waves put up a valiant fight, but the Trojans were simply too good defensively in a hard-fought 9-4. Senior utility man Mace Rapsey also came up big against Pepperdine, scoring two goals for the Trojans in the second quarter to put them up 5-2 and give them a bit of a cushion heading into the latter part of the game.
Some new faces stepped up for USC on Saturday, including junior utility man Ivan Kustic and junior driver Marc Vonderweidt. Kustic poured in four goals for the Trojans against Diablo Valley, while Vonderweidt had three against Diablo and another against Pepperdine.
Vonderweidt’s goal came at a crucial time for the Trojans against the Waves, as it stopped a rally by Pepperdine in the final period and cinched the victory for USC.
The victory over Diablo Valley marked the first game of the season in which senior standout Nikola Vavic did not score a goal. The Ranchos Palos Verdes native entered the tournament 18 goals away from taking over as USC’s all-time scoring leader. He drew within 17 with a goal against Pepperdine, meaning he might obtain the record at home next week, setting up a sweet homecoming for water polo fans.
This coming week, the Trojans will make their home opener and start a stretch of three straight games at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, beginning with two games against Princeton and Whittier College on Saturday, Sept. 28. Last season, USC beat Princeton in resounding fashion with a 22-5 victory at home.
Following its homestand, USC will travel to Irvine, Calif. for the SoCal Tournament on Oct. 12.

The USC women’s volleyball team took care of business in its final pre-conference game of the season, turning back Cal State Fullerton 3-0 Friday night to improve to 10-1.

The Women of Troy honored All-American middle blocker Emily Adams in between the second and third sets, raising her No. 9 to the rafters of the Galen Center. The squad did her proud in sweeping CSUF (25-19, 25-16, 25-23) to improve to 23-0 all-time against the Titans.
“We played really well. We had times of greatness and times where we had to step back and take a deep breath, but I think that happens with any young team,” senior libero Natalie Hagglund said.
Hagglund recorded 17 digs and was complemented nicely by senior outside hitter Sara Shaw, who notched a season-high 14 of her own. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio turned in another strong performance with 15 kills, and her freshman counterpart Ebony Nwanebu chipped in 10. Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard added seven.
USC suffered a critical loss, however, when junior setter Hayley Crone injured herself during the second set and had to be removed from the game. Freshman setter Alice Pizzasegola, who had split duties with Crone to start the season, filled in ably with 17 assists to go along with five digs.
USC head coach Mick Haley praised the team’s competitiveness following Crone’s injury and a strong push from Fullerton in the latter stages of the match.
“We were not in rhythm and we are still struggling to get a rhythm, so we were kind of drained. I really think it was the trajectory of our passes and then losing Hayley [Crone], of course, added to that stress,” Haley said. “But it was a 3-0 win. They had opportunities to come back and get us, but we were able to hold them off, and we were constantly adding points. This game was a confidence builder because we were able to come back and win without Hayley.”
The first set saw both teams battle to a 14-14 tie before USC pulled away. Shaw recorded a service ace in between kills by Olgard and Bricio to take the lead at 17-14, after which back-to-back Bricio aces gave the Women of Troy an insurmountable lead. USC sealed the set when junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer knocked down a kill and CSUF committed an attacking error.
USC stormed out of the gates in the second frame, posting a 16-9 lead on an Olgard kill. The Titans pushed hard but never came within more than five points of USC the rest of the way. A pair of CSUF attacking errors brought up match point, after which sophomore middle blocker Kiara Wright knocked down a kill to give USC the set 25-16.
“We had some players who had the chance to perform. Emily [Young] got to come in and set, which was incredible because she has not had that opportunity,” Hagglund said. “Kiara [Wright] came in and played awesome by hitting some great balls and had some big blocks. It was really cool to see.”
The combination of Crone’s injury and a strong Fullerton push made the third set challenging for USC, who at one point fell behind 16-14. Kills by Schraer and Shaw, however, pushed USC to a 22-19 lead, after which junior outside hitter Emily Young knocked down the last of her five kills to seal the match.
With crosstown rival No. 11 UCLA coming to the Galen Center this week, Haley stressed that his squad is still not performing at an optimal level, especially with regard to its offense.
“We can’t make so many errors,” Haley said. “I thought Fullerton provided us a chance to practice against a different offensive system, and that showed us two and three different timings. So our block jump timing had to be adjusted whether they set back row, front row or quick, and they did a nice job of alternating those. That is something we need to get better at.”

In the modern game of college football, there are basically three types of offenses that are widely used.
There’s the classic pro-style offense that uses a strong running game to wear out defenses and set up play-action passes. There’s the spread offense that utilizes a strong-armed pro-style quarterback and dynamic receivers. And there’s the hybrid spread scheme that employs a dual-threat signal-caller who could either distribute the ball to speedy skill players or take it upon himself to elude defenders in the open field.
With their victory over Utah State, the Trojans have now demonstrated that they can stop all three.
USC showed the ability to stifle pass-heavy playbooks by overpowering Hawai’i and Washington State, who combined for 79 pass attempts against the Trojans.
In dominating Boston College and its running back Andre Williams, who rushed for just 39 yards against USC after entering as the nation’s third-leading rusher, the Trojans’ gargantuan front seven indicated they wouldn’t be beat by a pro-style run-heavy system.
And on Saturday, USC overcame a prestigious mobile quarterback for what seemed like the first time in years by bottling up Utah State’s Chuckie Keeton, who’s totaled some impressive statistics in two-plus years as a starter for the Aggies.
Keeton was 21-of-39 for 179 yards and two touchdowns on Saturday, giving him a raw quarterback rating of 19.5 after he had averaged a QBR of 92.3 in the Aggies’ first three games.
Perhaps more importantly, Keeton was held to -15 yards on 12 carries. The longest rush Keeton had all day against the Trojans was his last, a six-yard pickup on Utah State’s failed fourth-and-nine attempt that spelled the end for the Aggies.
USC head coach Lane Kiffin credited defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s strategy to contain Keeton, which entailed aligning defensive ends and linebackers wide before having them angle in and rush tight to keep Keeton in a makeshift bottleneck in the pocket.
“Clancy had a great plan going in of condensing the rush lanes against him,” Kiffin said. “Anytime you have a great player at QB like they do, it’s going to be hard to take him out of the game … So many times Utah State had an opportunity to score but our defense just kept going out there.”
After just four games, it’s clear that Pendergast and his aggressive 5-2 scheme are a much better fit at USC, and could be just what the Trojans need to halt the ascension of those pesky avians in Eugene and those silly shrubberies from Palo Alto.
Under Monte Kiffin, the Trojans struggled mightily against quick quarterbacks who could run the read option or at least catch the attention of USC’s defense when they left the pocket.
Last year, USC’s season was derailed by a 39-36 loss to Arizona, as quarterback Matt Scott had 100 yards and a rushing touchdown on the ground in addition to 369 yards and three touchdowns through the air.
UCLA’s Brett Hundley didn’t exactly rip USC’s defense with his legs last November, as he gained just 10 rushing yards, but he did have two rushing touchdowns that proved pivotal in the Bruins’ 38-28 victory at the Rose Bowl.
And of course, there’s Oregon’s vaunted mile-a-minute offense that has recently torn USC to shreds and revolutionized college football.
Last year, the Ducks broke just about every offensive record held by USC’s opponents through the Trojans’ illustrious 125 years as a varsity football program. In what would be his final game against USC as Oregon’s head coach, Chip Kelly oversaw perhaps the most impressive performance of any team under his tutelage as the Ducks romped for 62 points and 730 yards. Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota was nearly flawless, completing 20-of-23 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns and rushing for 96 yards on 15 carries.
And even though that dismantling was truly a one-of-a-kind display, it wasn’t exactly an aberration. USC hasn’t held Oregon under 35 points since 2008.
Some might say that learning how to stop Stanford’s power-running attack is more vital to USC’s success. After all, the Trojans haven’t beaten the Cardinal since 2008, and a matchup against Stanford looms large on the schedule this season while USC gets to avoid Oregon.
But there are far more teams in college football incorporating the read-option into their offense, and it’s imperative that USC learns to contain those dual-threat gunslingers. Arizona, Utah and UCLA all feature quarterbacks who feel just as comfortable tucking the ball and running as they do setting their feet in the pocket.
When USC upset the Ducks 38-35 in Eugene in 2011, Oregon running backs Kenjon Barner and LaMichael James still managed to combine for more than 200 yards on 35 rushing attempts. But the Trojans bottled up quarterback Darron Thomas, who gained just five yards on nine carries, and no Oregon running play went for more than 17 yards.
As the Trojans enter the bulk of their Pac-12 slate, the defense will be tested each week by a variety of schemes in a conference that’s made its case for the deepest league in the country by going 29-4 against nonconference opponents this season.
“I think now in our conference, the offenses are better than they used to be,” Kiffin said after the victory over the Aggies. “I think we’re going to be tested in different ways from some high-powered offenses and today we passed that test.”
The team is preparing to face its toughest opponent — yet again — in Arizona State this Saturday. But I’m confident that at least the defense will show up to play in Tempe. The offense, you ask? Well, we’ll see.

The defense is fantastic and they are learning every week, progressing quite nicely, as they prep for the upcoming offenses. Sure wish I could say the same for the offense

In a game of wasted offensive chances caused by poor special teams play on both sides, USC turned in a superb game on defense and did just enough on offense to claim its third victory of the season in a sloppy 17-14 win over visiting Utah State.
Doing their part · The USC defense, led by redshirt junior linebacker and team captain Hayes Pullard (10), continues its stellar start to the season. Against Utah State, Pullard had five tackles and two pass breakups. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
A slew of penalties and missed opportunities prevented the Trojans (3-1) from turning the game into a rout in the fourth quarter, and the Aggies (2-2) hung around through the final minutes until USC’s defense punctured Utah State’s upset hopes by stopping quarterback Chuckie Keeton on a fourth-down scramble.
“We wanted to keep [Keeton] in front of us and not let him get to the sidelines,” freshman safety Su’a Cravens said. “When I saw [Keeton] go down, I was thinking, ‘That’s exactly how we planned it.’”
SCORING SUMMARY
USC opened up the scoring on its second drive of the game with a 1-yard run from redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden. Later in the second quarter, after a 55-yard scamper from Utah State tailback Joey DeMartino brought the ball to the USC 8-yard line, Keeton completed a slant route to a leaping Brandon Swindall to knot the score at seven apiece.
The teams then traded three-and-outs before USC used its grinding, two-back system to temporarily open up the passing game for redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler. Seven consecutive runs — four from Madden, three from freshman tailback Justin Davis — preceded a third-down conversion from junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and a 30-yard touchdown pass to redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble, who sailed undetected past Utah State’s safeties on a picturesque seam route down the middle to give USC a 14-7 advantage.
After halftime, the Aggies showcased the explosiveness that USC head coach Lane Kiffin had been wary of in practice all week. A nine play, 72-yard drive took just 3:23 off the clock and deadlocked the score at 14 midway through the third quarter, the first time USC had given up any points in the third quarter this year.
But after that, USC’s defense held Utah State in check through the end of the game, and junior kicker Andre Heidari provided the game-winning points for USC via a 25-yard field goal with 13:35 remaining.
NOT SO SPECIAL TEAMS
Outside of redshirt sophomore punter Kris Albarado, who pinned the Aggies inside their 20-yard line five times, the play of USC’s special teams was certainly not a strength. Heidari missed a 46-yard field goal in the third quarter, and the return teams failed to engineer any game-breaking plays.
But special teams were undoubtedly a larger issue for the Aggies. Utah State kicker Nick Diaz clanked a 37-yard field goal attempt off the right upright in the first quarter to keep the Aggies from cutting into USC’s 7-0 lead, marking the fourth consecutive game that the USC defense held its opponents scoreless in the opening quarter.
The Aggies also averaged just 34 yards per punt, including a botched 12-yard punt that gifted the Trojans great field position at Utah State’s 24-yard line as the clock turned into the fourth quarter.
USC seemed poised to put a touchdown on the board after a run by Madden and a reception by Grimble gave the Trojans a first-and-goal opportunity at the Aggies’ 8-yard line. But the Trojans only came away with Heidari’s field goal that edged the score to 17-14.
OFF DAY FOR OFFENSE
The USC rushing attack led by Madden and Davis, which averaged 196 yards per game and 4.5 yards per carry before Saturday, could only muster 118 rushing yards and 3.0 yards per carry against the Aggies. Madden finished with 93 yards on 24 carries, snapping his streak of three games with 100-plus rushing yards.
Kessler was 13-of-26 for 164 yards and one touchdown, and also fumbled shortly before halftime to deny the Trojans a chance to build up a multiple-possession lead.
The Trojans were held out of the end zone in the second half after Utah State repeatedly put eight men in the box in an attempt to stifle USC’s running game.
The scheme change left Lee and sophomore receiver Nelson Agholor outside with man-to-man coverage, a seemingly favorable position for the Trojans, but they failed to capitalize.
“There was a number of explosive plays in the passing game against their corners that we weren’t able to hit which would’ve dramatically changed the outcome of the game,” Kiffin said.
Lee let several deep balls slip through his hands and Kessler was off-target on a couple of long attempts to keep the Trojans from blowing the game open.
“I missed some throws and we dropped some balls and had some protection issues,” Kessler said. “Obviously, there is some stuff we missed and wished we had back.”
A particularly frustrating sequence for the Trojans saw them start three consecutive drives within Utah State’s 35-yard line, golden opportunities for USC to put the game away, only to score three total points.
“Obviously we would’ve liked to finish better offensively in the second half,” Kiffin said. “I did feel there was a rhythm early in the first half, and for whatever reason in the second half we weren’t able to establish that. Our defense kept getting us great field position and unfortunately we weren’t able to blow the game out at that point.”
DON’T BELIEVE THE HYPE
Keeton was largely kept in check despite occasionally flashing the dual-threat skills that had caused some minimal Heisman whispers. The senior finished 21-of-39 for 179 yards and two touchdowns, and was held to -15 rushing yards on 12 attempts.
“That’s just all the schemes with [defensive coordinator Clancy] Pendergast. He sets us up every week to play perfect,” redshirt junior defensive end George Uko said. “We had a good plan going the whole week with [defensive line coach Ed Orgeron] for inside tackles to push rush and outside people to align wide and just angle in and rush tight to keep [Keeton] in a tight box.”
Utah State had averaged 49.3 points, 550.3 yards and 29 first downs in its first three games, but the Trojans held them to just 14 points, 285 yards and 13 first downs. USC sacked Keeton four times and had 10 tackles for loss on the day.

Entrepreneur magazine ranked USC‘s Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies third on its list of Top 25 Undergraduate Colleges and Business Schools last week.
The Greif Center was ranked 10th  for the Top 25 Graduate Colleges.
The rankings, which were based on a Princeton Review survey of more than 2,000 colleges and universities between April and June of 2013, were determined based on factors including entrepreneurship programs, faculty, courses offered and mentorship programs.
Babson College and University of Houston claimed the top two undergraduate college ranking spots in the rankings.
Entrepreneur magazine’s ranking highlighted the program’s alumni business success post-graduation, as well as the number of mentorship programs and scholarships available to students.
The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies offers both a major and a minor in entrepreneurship and six mentorship programs. The school has offered the major program since 1971. Of the 50 percent of recent graduates who started businesses, 100 percent of them are still in business.
Currently, USC has five entrepreneurship organizations and clubs. Ninety-four percent of the Greif Center faculty are entrepreneurs themselves.

Famed statistician Nate Silver spoke to students and faculty in Bovard Auditorium on Friday morning in a presentation titled “Baseball and Politics are Data Driven.”
Numbers game · Writer and statistician Nate Silver speaks to students about the process of predicting outcomes on Friday at Bovard Auditorium. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Silver’s presentation was the first in a yearlong series of events made possible by the Dennis F. and Brooks Holt Distinguished Lecture, a speaker’s series. The event, put on by the Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Price School of Public Policy, drew students, faculty and members of the public for an hour-long lecture and Q & A with Silver.
Known for his extremely accurate predictions of election results over the last few years, Silver sold his original election prediction blog “538” to The New York Times, and later sold to ESPN.
He first gained national attention in 2008 when he correctly predicted both the primary election results and the presidential winner in 49 out of 50 states. In 2012, Silver topped his previous record and perfectly predicted the electoral map. Now, he’s taking the 538 blog to ESPN to bring his statistical knowledge to baseball.
Silver said his success stems from his ability to not only accurately interpret statistics, but also his ability to communicate this knowledge to others.
“As a statistician, you have to understand that however interesting your finding might be based on the statistical evidence, it won’t persuade anyone unless you have a wider audience,” he said. “I’m definitely far from the best statistician in the world, and I’m far from the best writer, but the overlap of those skills is what characterizes what I’ve tried to do.”
Silver began the presentation by describing the role technologies such as the printing press and the Internet have played in society. He discussed the importance of finding data that shows causation, not just correlation, the subject of his most recent book, The Signal and The Noise: Why Most Predictions Fail — But Some Don’t.
He concluded with a series of suggestions to help students navigate the data minefield and be aware of misleading information. Using a combination of graphs, jokes and well-timed Notre Dame jabs, Silver presented a lecture many students found entertaining.
Jack Knott, dean of the Price School, says making his expertise accessible is what sets Silver apart.
“Nate would be a great teacher. He is able to make statistics relevant to not just focusing on political elections, but because of his expertise in things like baseball and poker, he has a very special ability not only to do high level statistical analysis but to also communicate it in a way to a much broader audience,” Knott said.
Christian Patterson, a junior majoring in political science, said Silver’s unique style made the lecture engaging and fun.
“I thought that he was a very talented speaker,” he said. “His presentation made a very strong case for using statistics as a means of predicting election results.”
Knott also says that Silver’s outlook is the same view the Price School tries to instill in its students.
“Evidence-based public policy decision making is hugely important for our country — it’s not based just on ideology, or one partisan way of looking at something,” he said. “We offer courses that teach students to think in a probabilistic, statistical way about policy issues and about the role of information and the news media in information and decision making.”
Cat Duffy, a first year doctoral student in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, agreed.
“With the explosion of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, individuals are bombarded with information that is unfortunately presented as definitive fact, even when it lacks evidentiary proof,” Duffy said. “It’s important for students to recognize that being skeptical can be a virtue and recognizing that ‘not all information is created equal’ to ensure they make better and more informed decisions about the world around them.”
For Silver, statistics is not just about data, but also the perspective it can provide on how humans interact with their environment.
“To me, statistics do not just mean numbers,” he said. “It means an empirical way of looking at the world.”

New York University and USC have collaborated to create a breakthrough project in cancer treatment. Together, they have developed a new synthetic molecule that will disrupt the “conversation” between cancer cells in the human body.
According to a press release, the synthetic molecule created targets the interaction between two proteins, causing the genes to promote tumor progression. This compound was specifically designed to interrupt the type of molecular conversation within the cell that promotes the growth of cancer cells and tumor progression. The NYU team is lead by chemistry professor Paramajit Arora, and the USC team is led by the USC School of Pharmacy professor  Dr. Bogdan Olenyuk.
“Professor Paramjit Arora and I studied together at Caltech,” Olenyuk said. “He is an expert in bioorganic chemistry and chemical biology, specifically in the design of synthetic protein mimetics, and we have been working on this project since 2007.”
HBS1, the synthetic molecule described in their paper, limits tumor progression. The method required for locking the correct spiral helical shapes in synthetic strings of amino acids was developed at NYU.
“Our designed compound selectively disrupts expression of genes required for tumor progression and metastasis,” Olenyuk said.
The results from this research project could be tremendously important for the future in the scientific community.
“These results could dramatically improve several types of cancer therapies currently used in the clinic,” Olenyuk said.
Dr. Ramin Dubey, a member of Olenyuk’s team, who worked toward the development of small molecule therapeutics that targets angiogenesis, or formation of new blood vessels in tumors, was involved in development of two classes of molecules.
“Our approach works on transcriptional level of cancer progression by inhibiting the transcription factor HIF-1,” Dubey said. “Inhibiting the transcription factors directly is, in theory, a very powerful approach but not many practical examples are known for this strategy. Our work is a significant step in showing the practical relevance of this approach.”
Dr. Swati Kushal, a USC School of Pharmacology postdoctoral scholar, also contributed to the project by exploring the biological potential of the rationally designed compounds that can selectively disrupt the a transcription factor complex and hence down-regulate the expression of genes critical for tumor progression and metastasis.
“Our research has demonstrated the potential of designed protein secondary structure mimetics to become new research tools for disruption of protein-protein interfaces involved in transcription factor complex,” Kushal said.
The work will likely revolutionize the cancer treatment drug creation process.
“Of all the proteins in cells, less than 20 percent are considered as druggable,” Kushal said. “With the innovative approaches in hand, I would hope that it would be possible to raise this bar that would ultimately lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics.”
USC researcher Hanah Mesallati was involved in maintaining the cancer cell lines and carrying out in vitro cell-based assays, including viability and luciferase studies.
“The results of this research show that transcription factor protein domain mimetics can halt the growth of tumors in vivo,” Mesallati said. “Hopefully this research will eventually lead to the development of pharmaceutical agents, which will form part of an effective multi-drug chemotherapy regime.”

Kicks for Kids, a soccer league for young kids with developmental disabilities, played its first game Sunday at McCarthy Quad.
Started by Zade Shakir, the current president of the organization and a senior double majoring in biology and international relations, Kicks for Kids is a service organization dedicated to promoting a healthy and active lifestyle for children with disabilities in the greater Los Angeles area. Shakir founded the group in March after he attended USC’s annual Spirits in Action event, which is the university’s version of the Special Olympics. Shakir’s “buddy” at the event was diagnosed with autism, which inspired him to create more opportunities for children with developmental disabilities to participate in sports.
Shakir said there is a correlation between kids with developmental disabilities and obesity. To combat this correlation, Shakir wanted to create a social environment where children could run around and families could cheer them on. USC students involved in the program couldn’t agree more.
“I would like them to feel a sense of togetherness, like unity amongst other people,” said the programs’ marketing director Sharon D’Souza, a senior majoring in communication. “I think it’s really important that they understand the importance of being active and that they can still be active. Whatever barriers they’re facing, it shouldn’t hold them back.”
D’Souza said that the parents of these children work hard to pay for their kids’ medical bills and hoped that this event could help them stay active even with their families’ busy schedules.
The organization advertised to pull together more than 50 volunteers who signed up to help for the first game, according to D’Souza. They contacted all the occupational therapy professors and asked if they could present their organization to students, and many professors even offered extra credit to students for participating in Kicks for Kids. The organization also reached out to groups such as sororities and fraternities, which have service requirements.
“It’s really the epitome of Trojan Family. Everyone I’ve talked to about the program has been so helpful and so willing to go for it,” Shakir said.
Student volunteers at the event mentioned that there are a lot of recreational centers that do not provide special events for children with developmental disabilities, so when they found Kicks for Kids, they pounced on the opportunity to volunteer.
“I think every kid I talked to here said soccer is their favorite thing to do, and I know that can be a problem if you live in the inner city to get an opportunity to play,” said Tom Murphy, a junior majoring in economics and math.
The event was a great opportunity, not just for the children but for the volunteers as well.
“When I used to practice, I did not meet with a lot of autistic kids, and I’ve learned about them but I’ve never met them. It was a great experience to know how autistic kids at an older age are doing, how they do in society, how they do when they are with a lot of new people around,” said Charmi Patel, a graduate student studying occupational therapy.
Rima Al-Rabadi, a junior majoring in global health, said she has spent a lot of wtime working with kids with disabilities through her involvement with the USC Helenes. She thought Kicks for Kids would be another great way for students to simultaneously engage with the community and have a rewarding experience.
“I really enjoy having ‘buddies’ and getting to be a part of their lives,”  Al-Rabadi said. “I feel as though they teach me a lot as well. They’re always so happy, excited and ready to do whatever event we have planned for them to do.”

The University of Southern California is home to some of America’s best tailgates and traditions, a place where the weekends never end. There’s always something brewing on campus, whether it’s on The Row or at McCarthy Quad. Opportunities to socialize exist every minute of the day and night. So in the middle of all the mischief, it can get difficult to make time for oneself.
But as the nights get cooler and the sky a little gloomier this fall, pause. Breathe. During those overcast days spent making a cup of tea and finishing homework, relish in the best thing in this world: you.
This special playlist is made for the homebodies, the nighttime cereal-eaters, the incessant nappers, the quiet-time lovers. This is a sweater weather playlist to remind you that there’s nothing wrong with spending time alone.

“Lost in the Light” by Bahamas
Bahamas is the stage name of Canadian artist Afie Jurvanen. Unlike most indie-folk numbers that feature subdued vocals, Juravenen’s voice rings clearly in his songs. He brings his fans plenty of captivating selections in his most recent album, Barchords. “Lost in the Light,” in particular, has the ability to mesmerize and captivate listeners with simple lyrics and pure instrumentals. His work has earned him several well-deserved nominations at the 2013 Juno Awards.
“Wrapped in Piano Strings” by Radical Face 
Ben Cooper is the mysterious man behind Radical Face. His 2007 album, the fittingly titled Ghost, hosts 11 fascinating selections. Cooper’s eerie vocals manifest themselves in an instrumentation of various string and percussion instruments.
“A Change Is Gonna Come” by Ben Sollee
Kentucky-born gentleman Ben Sollee will woo you with this jazz-based number. The cello-laden intro and saxophone-savvy exit bring an upbeat rhythm to this selection, so savor this break from all the indie-folk melodies featured in this week’s “Traveler’s Tracks.”
“17” by Youth Lagoon
We’re back to the slower anthems with Youth Lagoon, the solo project of Boise, Idaho artist Trevor Powers. His appearance at this past summer’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival drew large crowds, as  festivalgoers flocked to hear Powers’ ghost-like vocals and uncanny synthesized beats. Though his lyrics are generally inaudible, they’re worth a closer listen. Some standout lines include: “When I was seventeen / My mother said to me / Don’t stop imagining, the day that you do is the day that you die,” and, “At least God doesn’t judge me by the thoughts that I find / The snakes I couldn’t find / I don’t want to find.”
“I’m Getting Ready” by Michael Kiwanuka
Blues singer Michael Kiwanuka’s voice has a texture of an entirely different era. Perhaps it is this characteristic that attracts listeners to Kiwanuka’s creations. “I’m Getting Ready,” the most popular track from his 2011 EP, reflects the style of ’60s soul artist Otis Redding. Especially since auto-tune dominates radio hits these days, Kiwanuka’s raw talent is refreshing.
“All the Years” by Wild Child
The ukulele-laden, happiness inducing tunes of folk-pop group Wild Child is a must-have for any relaxing playlist. The lyrics of this folk-pop group from Texas can melt even the coldest of hearts: “You, you know you mean the world to me / I can’t think of a better thing than growing old with you / You know I need you by my side / And everything seems better now with you here in my life.” Oh, and a note for the romantics: Share this one with your significant other. It’ll prove too cute to resist.
“Dear Marie” by John Mayer
Hints of tambourine, harmonica solos and Mayer’s sweet fingerpicking in this song will transport you to prairie fields. Despite the golden lyrics, my favorite snippet comes at 2:50, when Mayer simply croons a series of “Oh-oh”s and lets his guitar do the talking.
“Gray or Blue” by Jaymay
Jamie Seerman picked up the pseudonym Jaymay to distinguish herself from other artists. “Gray or Blue,” from one of her earliest albums, Autumn Fallin’, is a stunning arrangement of instruments such as the drums, guitar, piano, triangle and even the glockenspiel.
“If Only” by Fink
English artist Finian Greenhall started his career producing techno music and working as a DJ. But as Fink, he makes a structural shift by creating songs with a lullaby-like quality and deep, meaningful lyrics. In “If Only,” he sullenly croons, “I ain’t got the makings of / The man you deserve, I ain’t got the time / If only.” Fink’s songs have been featured in myriad popular television shows, such as Friday Night Lights, CSI: NY and Greek.

It’s a pity that Los Angeles doesn’t get a real fall. Bestselling author Jamie Ford’s sophomore release, Songs of Willow Frost, is a bittersweet chronicle of love and loss that almost begs to be read with a stiff glass of whiskey (or tea, for those underage) by a windowsill that overlooks a drizzly autumn day. In an ideal world, a soft jazz song would be playing in the background to seal the mood.
Sleepless in Seattle · Jamie Ford, author of Songs of Willow Frost, grew up in Seattle and incorporates elements of the city into his novel. – Courtesy of Jamie Ford
Set in Seattle in the 1920s and ’30s, before and after the stock market crash, Songs explores the relationship of a Chinese-American mother, Liu Song, and her estranged son, 12-year-old William Eng. William has lived in an orphanage for most of his life, but he still remembers his “Ah-ma,” who left him as a young child for unknown reasons. After he sees his mother on screen — now a famous “Oriental movie star” going by the stage name Willow Frost — he vows to find her and learn the truth about his heritage.
Ford is a talented storyteller, and Songs showcases his skill at bringing historic places and people to life. The pages are rich with descriptive prose that paints historic Seattle on a large and expressive canvas, as the plot interweaves William’s search to find his mother against Willow’s journey, which will lead her to give up her only son.
Songs will resonate with fans of Ford’s first novel, On the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, as the books share complementary strengths, tonally and thematically speaking. Both are love stories rooted in the past, yet unraveling in the present, full of sacrifice and longing. Each story is also inspired by the Chinese-American culture in Seattle, set in periods when the rights of Chinese-Americans were unfairly limited.
Unfortunately, the central characters in Songs do not feel as realized as those in Ford’s first novel. That is not to say that William or Liu Song seem static — far from it. They overflow with a distinct essence of the era and embody overarching themes that many people have experienced. Still, the characters at times feel like a means to an end: puppets, whose strings are thin enough that one might not notice them at first, until, that is, they are yanked to serve the novel’s purpose.
Songs is semi-autobiographical and that might be the book’s biggest strength and weakness. The ideas that these characters struggle with are real: Ford’s own mother was poor and couldn’t afford to give birth in a hospital. Ford’s grandmother was a U.S. citizen, who used the freedom America provided to her advantage and yet, as a minority, was unable to receive proper medical care. Both women proved to be resilient in their own ways and it is easy to see why Ford borrowed elements of each woman when writing Willow, especially.
Still, perhaps having such a personal connection to the characters might have made it too tempting to give Willow and her son a happy ending. On principle, there isn’t anything wrong with a happy ending — it’s hard to find someone who would object to a story that cuts likable characters a break. But there is a problem when that “happily ever after” feels forced.
In this case, the ends tie together too neatly. Willow has strong personality traits, yet she seems to stand by them firmly only when they suit the plot. Truly, if one were to go back to the beginning of the novel, it seems strange that she never tried to take William out of the orphanage after she became a star. Yes, there are reasons behind her decision to stay away. But at the same time, she had the means for some time to take William and go somewhere where they could be a family. Why, then, was it up to William to find her?
William’s best friend, Charlotte, also feels like a plot device at times. Her story is a powerful one: She is a blind girl whose abusive father adopts her in order to receive her government support check. But ultimately her role in the story seems to be written solely to spur William into action.
Still, despite these character flaws, the overall tapestry of the story is magnificent. Reading Songs is like stepping back in time. Ford has done his homework to create highly evocative descriptions of the period’s food, clothing and culture. He credits an exhaustive list of resources including Seattle’s Wing Luke Museum of the Asian American experience, the Museum of History & Industry, the Tacoma Public Library and University of Washington’s Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights Projects for helping him research the period, and it shows.
Indeed, Seattle at that time feels like its own character in the story. Songs might falter at times when it comes to Willow and William’s interaction, but throughout the novel, Seattle is living and breathing. Finishing the story, William and Willow might not stay with you long, but Seattle will. It comes alive through Ford’s story and it is magnificent.

One ability that movies have, when they are done right, is to take an issue that appears cut and dry and mine unexpected things from it. It is difficult to look past the horror of child abduction. With the Ariel Castro case all over the news earlier this year, the shocking nature of what terrible things some people are capable of doing to others is still fresh in our minds. Denis Villeneuve’s film Prisoners takes child abduction and explores it more deeply. The film, through great direction and writing, and even better acting, manages to follow two major threads related to the kidnapping. The first is a thread relating to the psychological impact something like this causes, bringing to light a spectrum of primal emotions. Films like these can be termed psychological suspense and horror, as the thought process involved in the attempt to apprehend such criminals can become very dark.

The story revolves around two characters. Hugh Jackman’s plays Keller Dover, the father whose daughter was abducted during Thanksgiving dinner. His struggle to do anything he can to get her back is one of the two pillars on which the movie stands, and it takes a very dark turn when he kidnaps the man who used to be a prime suspect and keeps him prisoner in an attempt to get answers out of him. His storyline drives the psychological questions the movie poses, both in the examination of his actions and the reactions of the people around him. The other character is Jake Gyllenhaal’s Detective Loki, the law enforcement officer in charge of the investigation. He plays the detective assigned to the case who has to simultaneously deal with the complicated case before him and the wild card that is Keller Dover. His story line drives the suspense aspect of the film as he attempts to unravel the web of what is going on around him.
As one begins to watch the film, it is Jackman’s character that stands out immediately. He plays a patriarch obsessed with disaster preparedness. Keller brims with an intensity that makes him never appear comfortable, even in the opening scenes where he is just having a Thanksgiving dinner with his family. That intensity explodes into anger as the situation with his daughter continues. So intense is that fire that, in the first act of the movie, it is hard to relate to him. His response to everything is short-tempered and violent. He seems insane when he plans to kidnap the wonderfully creepy Alex, played perfectly by Paul Dano.  As the film goes on, however, and the horror of the situation becomes clearer, Jackman’s violent outbursts seem less like the flailings of a madman and instead acts of almost powerless desperation against an unseen enemy.
It is that invisible enemy that transforms the investigative thread from a mere thriller into a true horror film. There is an idea in horror filmmaking that the unseen monster is always scarier than the one we can see. The audience’s imagination can usually imagine something much more terrifying than whatever the filmmakers are able to put on the screen. In Prisoners, one cannot see the crime being committed. The audience sees the girls in one scene and they are gone in the next. The audience doesn’t know who took them, where they are, or what happened to them. One sees a little more than the characters do, but not much. The audience only knows they were taken by someone. So the audience searches for whatever explanation it can — whatever way it can find to explain what happened — to imagine what kind of monster could do that. The families in the film are in similar disbelief while Gyllenhaal’s character struggles to stay clear-minded in the face of an emotional maelstrom.
It is through the great cast that the film employs that the viewer can fully observe the spectrum of responses invoked by the horror going on on-screen. A murderer’s row of character actors fills out the rest of the cast. Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo and the aforementioned Dano all evoke a heartbreaking spectrum of emotions, not to mention bales of the subtlety that Jackman lacks in his performance.
Villeneuve manages to merge the two aspects of  masterfully. Again, at first as the scenario is being set up, some of the notes seem a bit out of place. Jackman’s unease is a bit too obvious, the story a bit too formulaic. Villeneuve however begins his first American film with the same knack for intensity that has characterized his earlier offerings. Indeed the psychological cyclone that develops around Jackman’s character and the static electricity of suspense and horror that builds up around Gyllenhaal’s investigation finally collides, in large part through Roger Deakins’s masterful cinematography. That forms a perfect storm of intense, riveting and ultimately satisfying cinema.

On Sept. 12, the family of Rosa Esparza, a 52-year-old woman who died earlier this summer, filed a lawsuit against Six Flags Over Texas, according to ABC News. On July 19, Esparza was hurled 75 feet from a cart maneuvering twists and turns at over 60 miles per hour on the ride Texas Giant. Upon the amusement park’s announcement that the ride was would reopen, the family promptly filed suit accusing Six Flags of negligence and requesting at least $1 million in compensation.
The suit alleges that the T-shaped lap bar that is installed in the amusement park’s roller coasters and is intended to securely fasten riders in place had malfunctioned while Esparza was on the ride. Inspections of the Texas Giant following Esparza’s death confirmed the faulty lap bar, exposing inconsistencies and intermittent failures within various parts of the ride’s safety system.
Six Flags, however, maintains that there were no mechanical failures on the cart Esparza was riding. Instead, what has been highlighted in the issue is Esparza’s physique; debate has arisen over whether or not the lap bar was designed to secure someone of her weight, a 200-plus pounds supported by a mere 5-foot-2 frame, according to ABC News.
Esparza’s family is entirely correct in pursuing a suit against Six Flags. It is outrageous to pin the fault on Esparza for not being aware of her own weight in relation to the cart when the one responsibility maintained by roller coaster operators is to guarantee the safety of patrons through safety measure compliance.
One cannot be quick to assume that Esparza’s failure to comply with safety guidelines of weight measurements was her own fault. The truth of the matter is that a rider’s unfamiliarity with safety guidelines is credited entirely to the negligence and incompetence of roller coaster personnel in fulfilling their sole responsibility of ensuring patron safety on rides, thus rightfully pinning the family’s blame on the amusement park.
There have been numerous insensitive opinions asserting that the lawsuit is just an extension of “sue-happy” American culture, noting that Esparza is the only one who maintains responsibility for her death by failing to recognize that the ride was not designed to support someone of her stature.
This argument is outrageous and roots itself in pure ignorance; the indisputable fact of the matter is that the primary responsibility of amusement park personnel is to make certain that riders are familiar with safety measurements before they are seated in their cart. Furthermore, though it would behoove them to be aware of safety regulations, it is entirely irrelevant whether or not park patrons are familiar with these measurements — if an individual is unfit to be on a certain ride, personnel are fully responsible for knowing the lethal repercussions of breaching safety measurements and ensuring that that individual does not end up riding the roller coaster, period.
Another handful of critics are asserting that many overweight individuals often create a fuss over personnel stating that they will not be able to ride, and that this protest often leads to personnel simply allowing them to ride because they do not want to deal with the complaints. This comment makes it seem as though roller coaster operators are held up at gunpoint by overweight patrons and have no choice but to allow them to ride. But if there are personnel who allow unfit riders to ride solely because they raise hell over being told otherwise, it is self-explanatory that personnel is irresponsible and unfit to be monitoring the safety of patrons at an amusement park. The job of the personnel is to ensure rider safety, not to negate it.
According to statistics compiled by the Amusement Safety Organization, Esparza’s death is just one of many repeatedly reported at Six Flags attractions across the nation –— it seems that the entire system has the same problem of incompetent, ill-trained personnel. If the amusement park chain persists to fail in both addressing this issue and putting an end to the death counts that continue to accumulate year after year, then it very well may also cease to operate in the near future.

As a flight attendant for over 20 years I can tell you that it is squarely Six Flag’s fault mostly for the reasons that this blog writer stated but one important factor is what was missing. The family’s attorney is most likely incorrect that the lap bar failed. As Six Flags stated there was no mechanical failure. With large people such as the victim in this case the lap bar must go underneath the roll of the belly even if the passenger must lift up/push in/scoot back in seat momentarily until the bar goes underneath the belly roll and can then be pushed down low and tight across the passenger’s hip BONES. However it is not the responsibility of the passenger to know this. Thus Six Flags should be held 100% liable for failure to teach this to it’s employees and failure to follow through on supervision to be sure that it was applied.
The author of this article, I’d contend, has no real understanding of or experience in the amusement park industry.  
To enumerate the number of overstatements and falsities in this article would take more time than I have; however, I do wish to discuss a couple of key ones.  
I challenge the author to find any credible source (i.e. not some random CNN reporter whose goal, more often then not, is to make every story as sensational as possible) who agrees that Esparaza’s lapbar was “faulty.”  The failure of a hydraulic lapbar, such as the one on Texas Giant is almost statistically impossible.  There is zero evidence to suggest, beyond the hyperbole of the uninformed, that, in this specific case, Esparaza’s lapbar released or “came open” mid ride.  On the contrary, all credible reports point to the roller coaster train in question returning to the station with Esparaza’s lapbar in the locked position.  
Now, while there has been some discussion of an indicator light having been faulty and replaced in Esparaza’s seat sometime prior to the accident, that is not at all the same as a faulty restraint.  Firstly, the mere existence of a past repair in no way proves anything about the cause of this particular accident.  (Machines, including automobiles, computers, etc., are repaired many times over the course of their useful lives, and a repair in no way renders the repaired machine a definite hazard.)  Secondly, even if the indicator light were to have failed at the time of Esparaza’s death (which has not yet been proven), the indicator light is itself an auxiliary system that assists ride operators in their duties, but it in no way relates to the integrity of the lapbar itself.  And furthermore, a faulty indicator light by no means “expos[es] inconsistencies and intermittent failures within various parts of the ride’s safety system.”  The indicator light is, again, one small part of a much larger safety system, and there exist overlapping safety procedures to prevent the indicator light from being the sole obstacle to a horrendous accident.  
And by what logic does the author rule the ride operators “incompeten[t]?”  As others have already commented, there are numerous other parties at play here (including the designer of the train, Grestlauer), and it seems rash, to me, to rule the ride operators at fault without any real supporting evidence.  The causes of accidents are oftentimes fairly complex, involving the actions of multiple different parties rather than resting completely on the shoulders of one individual or that individual’s actions.  I fail to see how, from the isolation of his / her computer chair, the author can deem Six Flags personnel uniformly “incompetent” and “Ill-trained.”  Comments such as those merely further expose the author’s ignorance of the industry, including the extensive training Six Flags employees actually receive.  
As for the assertion that Esparaza’s death is “just one of many repeatedly reported at Six Flags attractions across the nation,” this is ludicrous, sensational journalism blather at its finest.  The number non-prexisting condition related deaths (i.e. those not due to a preexisting heart condition, for example, for which the victim was wholly responsible) that have occurred at Six Flags parks over the past decade can be counted on one hand.  When compared to the hundreds of millions of guests who have visited said Six Flags parks during that time period, this “death count” becomes perspectively infinitesimal.  
The fact is, excessive weight can and has been known to play a role in causing a particular rider to not fit properly within a particular ride’s “one size fits” all restraints.  (For those who are interested, take a look at the Perilous Plunge incident at Knott’s Berry Farm in 2001.)  Is it largely the responsibility of the ride operator(s) to ensure that a rider fits before allowing that rider to ride?  Absolutely.  And while I’d argue this is a shared responsibility with the rider (anyone who has been to an amusement park knows that there exists an abundance of posted riding instructions and safety guidelines, it being the riders’ duty to read these signs and ensure their compliance), I won’t go so far as to say Esparaza was at fault for her death.  But are ride operators / manufacturers  / designers reasonably expected to account for every outlying body type?  When the number of possible body types is nearly infinite in number, I think not.  If human foresight were that complete and perfect, there would be no problems in the world at all to speak of. 
In conclusion, I think it important to keep Esparaza’s death in perspective.  For every amusement park related death, amusement parks have proven safe for millions of other guests.  Amusement parks are statistically less dangerous than a whole host of other activities in which we participate regularly: driving, swimming, flying on a plane, etc.  And yet, for every fatality resulting from a car crash, does the population suddenly take to the Internet publishing outlandish articles that decry automobiles as death traps designed and manufactured by mean, incompetent human beings?  Of course not.  The world is not perfect, and no activity is free of at least some degree of risk.
I extend my deepest sympathies to Esparaza’s family and hope the amusement park industry can learn from this incident to ensure it never happens again.  I can’t help but feel it a disservice to Esparaza’s memory, however, to engage–as did, I feel, the author of this article–in wild speculation and emotionally-driven finger pointing.  This sort of pontificating does nothing for Esparaza, but it most certainly and unjustly disparages a whole host of innocent people who are trying to make a living and do good through the amusement park industry.  Who really benefits from that?
Well said.
I don’t think anyone is arguing that it was properly designed. I certainly didn’t. What’s being argued is that it operated as designed. That doesn’t mean it was designed properly. That’s why I say the responsibility falls to the Manufacturer. Of course Six Flags will be involved in the suit. But, I still have to go back to what I stated above, if the ride wasn’t being maintained and operated per the manufacturers guidelines, it would be Six Flags fault. If it was being maintained and operated per the manufacturers guidelines and the ride performed as designed, then it would be the manufacturers fault for a bad design.
If my car explodes due to a manufacturer defect, should I be responsible for injuries it causes?
Six flags hired professional engineers to deliver a safe ride. How was Six Flags supposed to know the restraint wouldn’t accommodate her?
Your car analogy does not have parity with the rollercoaster scenario. 
This is more like if a car manufacturer designed a tour bus and it turns out the seat belts have a design oversight where it does not fit properly for a reasonably wide range of body types. Then one day while on a tour, the tour company bus driver was involved in a collision (not caused by the bus driver, but a accident nonetheless). In that collision, most of the riders were ok but an obese person was thrown out of his seat and dies as a result of injuries. The family of the fat dead man has a legal cause to sue the bus manufacturer AND the bus tour company. The argument against the bus tour company is that a company that makes its money off such a critical piece of equipment, also needs to have their own safety measures in place to ensure a reasonable safe operating procedure.
A few years ago when it was discovered Toyota cars were experiencing brake failures, many car rental places immediately pulled Toyotas off their fleet – even before the official Toyota recall. the companies understood – even though they are not in the business of designing and manufacturing cars – they only rent them – that they could be also held liable for making business out of a faulty piece of equipment.
There’s a difference between being maintained properly and designed properly. If it wasn’t being maintained properly, it would be Six Flags fault. If it was being maintained properly and the ride performed as designed, then it would be the manufacturers fault. Six Flags didn’t design or manufacturer the ride. Nor, did they establish the procedures for operating the ride. Gerstlauer did. They are manufacturer and it seems to me that they would be the biggest one responsible here if the restraint performed as designed.
Your analysis is not entirely correct. Regardless who manufactures the ride, a ride is being SOLD to the public by Six Flags. Any rider who sustains injuries (or death in this case) can take action against Six Flags (as well as Gerstlauer). It is possible Six Flags may take action against Gerstlauer as well. 
The fact a human being died means it is a fool’s errand to even argue that the restraint was properly designed. Any engineer worth his salt needs to anticipate a wide range of body types for something like a roller coaster ride. Does this mean this ride is also unsafe for a 5’2″ male who weighs 200 lbs? That is ridiculous. If indeed Gerstlauer’s or Six Flags argument is that the ride is unsafe for someone – male or female – that fit that body description should be considered negligent right off the bat.

For decades, the world’s superpowers have operated under the pretense that chemical weapons should not be created or utilized in a time of war. Though this was agreed upon multiple decades ago, it seems as if a discussion over their validity must be held again. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has recently been under fire for his government’s supposed utilization of chemical weapons against rebels in the civil war. After weeks of will-we-or-won’t-we-strike debates, the United States and its allies have decided to try and work with the Syrian government in giving up and disabling the weapons in question, according to CNN. Allowing Assad to peacefully give up his chemical weapons in order to avoid a strike, however, is morally reprehensible and weakens the bargaining power of the United States.
Victoria Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
Most international laws and norms are enforced only by reciprocity, but some must be backed by force, and chemical weapons are an issue that absolutely requires enforcement and dissuasion through punishment.
One hundred and ninety countries have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which is administered by the United Nations, with Syria as the last signatory, according to paperwork filed with the U.N.  The CWC explicitly outlaws the creation, stockpile and use of chemical weapons. States, however, often sign international treaties such as this one because they are not backed by physical force. Politically speaking, it’s easy to sign a treaty and have no intention of meeting the provisions because there is no enforcement behind the treaty. For this reason, numerous international treaties rely on reciprocity, rather than force. Nevertheless, leaders blatantly disregard treaties such as those preventing the creation of weapons of mass destruction need to be brought back in line with the international community and punished so that they will not violate these laws again.
The reason that chemical weapons are illegal worldwide is because of the massive potential that the weapons have to inflict pain and death. Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote in his 1966 book, Arms and Influence, “Nuclear weapons make it possible to do monstrous violence to the enemy without first achieving victory.  Victory is no longer a prerequisite for hurting the enemy. One need not wait until he has won the war before inflicting ‘unendurable’ damages on his enemy.”
What the looming agreement between the U.S., Russia and Syria fails to do is act as a deterrent to the rest of the world to demonstrate the absolute “line in the sand,” as President Barack Obama repeatedly put it before Assad launched his gas attacks. The agreement, according to Foreign Policy, requires Assad to give up his chemical weapons to the international community but allows Assad to stay in power.
Thus, Assad will still be able to fight his bloody civil war, a war in which Assad has contributed to the deaths of more than 100,000 civilians and the flight of another 2 million, according to U.N. estimates. The problem with this plan is that it demonstrates that the international community is not willing to fight for the principles of human dignity and stop the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction.
To dictators or would-be aggressors with allies among the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, this deal demonstrates that powerful allies can prevent international intervention, even when those belligerents commit war crimes.
Weapons of mass destruction have long been considered a weapon of last resort, but for the U.S. to appease the demands of Russia and give Syria a free pass on using such weapons signals to these other countries that the U.S. will not stand by international rules of war, and might give them enough confidence to violate human dignity and use weapons of mass destruction in the hopes of maintaining their states.
It’s time for the international community and the U.S. to step up. Use of weapons of mass destruction cannot go unpunished.
