Undergraduate students pay a $64 student programming fee every semester to fund the Undergraduate Student Government’s budget, which stands at over $2.5 million for fiscal year 2023. At Tuesday’s Senate meeting, Alex Rohleder, the student-at-large member of USG’s Programming Fee Control Board, recommended a 7% increase to the student programming fee in 2024, amounting to an additional $4.48.
The PFCB is responsible for assisting the student body president in determining the cost of the student programming fee. The control board will look at a variety of factors including the current budget allocations, forecasted University admission and retention rates, forecasted University tuition, inflation and comparisons to other universities. 
Rohleder said that USC raises tuition approximately 5% annually, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $1 in October 2021 has the same buying power as $1.08 in October 2022, meaning the current inflation rate is around 8% and as such, USG will need their budget to increase similarly to the rising costs.
“To talk a little about the historical programming fee changes … in comparison to Stanford University, theirs functions similarly to ours,” Rohleder said. “$64 is what we charge each student and they charge $537, which is quite a difference, but just goes to show that there is quite a bit of room to increase our programming fee and still have it be quite modest in comparison to the other schools.”
The largest section  of budget allocations — $1,418,900 in 2023 — is distributed to the programming department. Each member committee and assembly therein presents an annual budget proposal to the budget allocation committee, who decides how much to allocate depending on how much USG can afford. At least three budget hearings are held each April, wherein account holders from each committee or assembly will present. 
“It would be cool if you could give everyone however much they wanted,” said chief financial officer Brian Stowe. “But we have a fixed sum of money so we have to make a judgment on how to allocate it.” 
Programming funds are split among twenty different assemblies and committees. The largest amount in FY 2023 is allocated to the Concerts committee at $574,300, in comparison to the Trojans Pride Committee which received $23,000. The funds that assemblies are given also vary; the Service Student Assembly got the least at $10,000 and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly received the most at $91,300.
When new committees and organizations are undergoing a trial period to become incorporated, they are given $5,000. This semester, the Middle Eastern and North African Student Association and the Joint Assembly of Military-Associated Students completed their trial period and have since been successfully incorporated as assemblies. They will present with other organizations in April for additional funding. 
The funding department, which Stowe oversees, holds an additional $349,000, broken up into a general and travel fund. This money is available to any student or Registered Student Organization that wants funding for an event for their organization or travel to an academic conference.
Students and RSOs must submit applications for funding at least five weeks prior to when the payment is needed and applications are approved on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once submitted, the funding team will assign the application to one of four funds: The Performing and Visual Arts Fund, the Philanthropy Fund, the Professional Fund and the Social, Recreation and Startup Fund each overseen by respective funding directors. 
Each organization can receive a maximum of $14,000 for each request. Funding proposals that are less than $5,000 only require the approval of the respective funding director, between $5,000 and $10,000 will require approval from the funding director and the chief financial officer, and between $10,000 and $14,000 will require the approval of all funding directors and the chief financial officer. 
At Tuesday’s Senate meeting, Stowe announced that they have processed 177 applications for funding and have used 98% of the allocated funds for the Social, Recreation and Startup Fund, 59% of the Performing and Visual Arts Fund, 66% of the Philanthropy Fund and 38% of the Professional Fund. 
The second largest part of the budget is the mandatory allocation of $409,800 toward students’ stipends and staff salaries. Per USG bylaws, students who receive stipends are paid in monthly installments and their salaries are decided by the Allocations committee each year. 
All salaries range from $1,000 to $9,000, with the highest-paying positions being the president and vice president and the lowest-paying positions being the assistant directors in the programming department, advocacy liaisons and elections commissioners. 
During the election period, each USG candidate is given a budget to spend as a part of their campaign; this expenditure totals to $13,850 allocated to elections. When a candidate submits their intent to run, they must also attach a preliminary campaign finance plan which will be published once approved by the elections commission. 
The ticket for the president and vice president campaign is given a combined $800, whereas each senatorial candidate is given $300 and a joint senatorial campaign is given a combined $400. 
“I think if they’re doing all of that with the $64 I think it’s a pretty efficient use of the money,” said Anh Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “If you’re able to get the people you need for the welcome-back concert and planning [other] events, and everything’s comfortable, I don’t see why $64 is unreasonable compared to the tuition and everything.”

You know what they say — what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. For USC’s defense, that truism could be the most positive outlook from its 47-24 loss in the Pac-12 Championship game Friday night.
Behind a hobbled sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams, the Trojans struggled to give some hope to the offense, giving up 533 total yards. Utah was 5-for-12 on third downs and averaged 9.1 yards per pass with only one turnover. 
The Utes’ 47 points were the third-most they’ve scored this season. Only Southern Utah and Colorado allowed more, two programs that are among the worst defensively in the country — the Buffaloes are second to last in the nation, the Thunderbirds 94th best in the FCS.
Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch was unavailable for comment after the game. Head Coach Lincoln Riley pointed out some missed opportunities. 
“I think tonight, defensively, we obviously played really well early, had a lot of momentum,” said Riley in a post game press conference Friday. “I thought really in the second half, it really changed. I felt like we were in position a lot defensively tonight. We dropped two or three very easy interceptions. I mean those are such big momentum plays.” 
It was a dream start for the defense. Utah scored three points in the first quarter and fumbled early in the second quarter. The rest of the game evolved into USC’s worst nightmare. 
The Trojans struggled to get to Utah’s junior quarterback Cameron Rising finishing with only one sack on the night. USC also had just three tackles for loss — a total that could have been increased as some tackles were missed in the backfield. 
Over 20 missed tackles marred the Trojans ability to get stops. Most of them came at the worst moments, including a 57-yard touchdown by sophomore Money Parks on a key 3rd-and-19 in the third quarter. 
“At the end of the game… We panicked a little bit. We got way too focused on trying to strip the ball or trying to make big plays as opposed to just getting them on the ground,” Riley said, “Our tackling was very poor at the end.” 
Coming into Friday night, the Trojans were in the midst of strong performances on defense in back-to-back games. 
USC held Notre Dame, who ran for 263 yards against then ranked No. 4 Clemson earlier in the season, to just 90 yards on the ground. The week before, a UCLA running attack that is statistically top five in the country had 204 rushing yards against the Trojans. 
But, USC’s pass defense was still a step behind.
Notre Dame’s sophomore quarterback Drew Pyne threw for a career-high 318 yards on a 88.5% completion rate. Even with three interceptions, the Bruins’ redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw for 309 yards, his second most this season. 
It was much of the same Friday night. Rising threw for 310 yards, the second most in his career, plus three touchdowns. His career high is 415 passing yards, which came against the Trojans in their earlier meeting this season. 
Missed chances on both sides of the ball hurt USC. Riley pointed out two specific instances where the Trojans didn’t capitalize on snatching the momentum. One of which came after the offense turned it over on downs moments after the Utes fumbled. 
“I mean just think how that game feels if offensively we go punch that in,” Riley said. “I mean those are big momentum plays that when you look back, so much can hinge on those. We drop a for sure interception and then I think they pop a score the very next play on a 3rd and long on a play we didn’t tackle very well. So I mean that’s the game right there.” 
In the most important game of the season, the side of the ball with the most questions coming into the year became the Achilles heel of the Trojans — a fitting end to USC’s College Football Playoff hopes. 
The Trojans will now turn their attention to what will likely be a New Year’s Six Bowl game.

After a week of flirting with a spot in the College Football Playoff, the magic for No. 4 USC ran out as the Trojans lost the Pac-12 Championship 47-24 to Utah Friday night.
“Obviously a disappointing night for us. You come as far as this team has come and this program has come in the last 12 months, you get that close to winning a championship and possibly much more and obviously to not get it done is a tough pill to swallow,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley following the game.
Injuries plagued USC from the get-go. Starting redshirt senior left guard Andrew Vorhees was ruled out before the start of the game. 
“I mean he’s one of the best offensive lineman in the country and so obviously not having him was a disappointment,” Riley said. “He’s really battled the last half of the season.”
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams tweaked his hamstring early in the game after a 59-yard run in the Trojans’ second drive of the game.
“You ever have a old rubber band? Yeah. Kind of felt like that,” Williams said. “The rest of the game, I felt it, but … a person that I admire is Kobe, and he always said ‘The game is bigger than what you’re feeling.’ And so I was in my head and encouraging myself that the game is bigger than what I was feeling.”
Williams was clearly limited after injuring his hamstring. The typically mobile quarterback was sacked a career-high 7 times.
“I mean, he was not even close to 50%. I definitely thought about taking him out,” Riley said. “He wouldn’t have let me and he didn’t let me and he wouldn’t even let me take him out at the end. In terms of guys I’ve coached at that position, it was maybe the gutsiest performance I’ve ever seen.”
Despite a strong first quarter, a defense that has struggled all season to tackle and prevent big plays proved to be, if anything, consistent. USC allowed more points than they had in any game this season. Three of Utah’s touchdowns came on plays over 50 yards, all in the second half.
“We dropped two or three very easy interceptions … And then at the end of the game, we got way too focused on trying to strip the ball or trying to make a play as opposed to just getting them on the ground,” Riley said. “And our tackling was very poor at the end.”
However, in the first quarter it was the Trojans who benefited from explosive plays and evaded tackles. On their opening drive, Williams made perhaps the most impressive throw of a season, which has been chock-full of impressive throws, on a 50-yard bomb to redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington. The Heisman favorite escaped a collapsing pocket and leapt into the air while releasing the ball to a wide open Washington.
“We obviously played really well early, had a lot of momentum. [Utah] seized it there in the second quarter,” Riley said.
After redshirt junior cornerback Max Williams caused a fumble in the second quarter, the Trojan offense turned the ball over on downs after gaining just 2 yards to set up Utah’s first touchdown of the game.
USC received the ball with 3:46 remaining in the first half and could have strung together a long, clock-chewing drive to end the half before the Utes started the second half with possession. However, Williams was sacked for the first time in the game and the Trojans punted.
The Utes took over with 1:40 remaining in the half, and finally got senior tight end Dalton Kincaid involved in the passing game. Junior quarterback Cameron Rising was poised in the pocket and accurate with his throws, eventually finding senior wide receiver Jaylen Dixon for a 4-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 17 at halftime.
Before Utah’s second drive of the third quarter, a video tribute to Aaron Lowe and Ty Jordan, two Utah football players who died last year, cued what has become a tradition among Utah fans. The “Moment of Loudness” saw the entire Utah bench empty in honor of their teammates. 
While the defense seemed to negate the recently-gained momentum in the opening plays of the drive, Rising hit Money Parks for a 57-yard touchdown on 3rd-and-19 to give Utah its first lead of the game. As Parks sprinted toward the end zone, the Utah section let out a roar that rivaled their “Moment of Loudness” just minutes before.
After the Utes extended their lead to 10 points a couple drives later, hope seemed to be rapidly running out for the Trojans. 
There were flashes of potential, including the Trojans’ only second-half touchdown drive where Williams picked up a crucial first down using his legs and tossed a touchdown to sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams to cut Utah’s lead to 3 points early in the fourth quarter.
However, Utah answered with a touchdown of their own, taking just 44 seconds to extend their lead back to 10 points. 
A drive that saw redshirt senior Brett Neilon go down with an injury and ended in Williams’ fourth interception of the season proved to be the nail in the coffin for USC. 
Neilon, who will be enshrined in USC football fans’ memories after his iconic push on a key fourth down against Oregon State earlier in the year, waved to the crowd as he was carted off of the field.
“Losing Neilon at the end when we had a little bit of momentum certainly hurt, too, because now, you’re shifting a lot of people and some of our depth showed up a little bit there at the end,” Riley said.
While the Trojans’ hopes at a College Football Playoff game are shattered, they will play in a bowl game. USC will find out which bowl game they are in and who they are playing on Sunday.
