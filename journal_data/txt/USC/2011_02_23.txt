After this week’s games at Arizona State and Arizona, the USC women’s basketball team could comfortably find itself in third place in the Pac-10, two games ahead of its closest competitors, with two games left in the regular season.
“Both games are very important,” said junior guard Ashley Corral. “This is a must-win road trip.”
The Women of Troy begin their road trip tonight against Arizona State. The two teams are currently tied for third place in the Pac-10 with 8-6 conference records.
If the Women of Troy continue their recent streak of hot shooting, they have a good chance of sweeping their opponents.
In last week’s game against California, the Women of Troy put on an offensive show.
They scored a season-high 50 points in the first half en route to an 80-67 win.
Two days earlier, USC hung around with No. 3 Stanford for most of the game, eventually falling behind late in a 78-64 loss that was closer than the score indicated.
“We came out shooting well both games,” Corral said. “Everybody’s finding their shot, finding their rhythm.”
Corral registered a career high, drilling seven three-pointers against Cal.
Sophomore guard Stefanie Gilbreath converted all four of her three-point attempts against Stanford, chipping in a total of 16 points.
That marked the first double-digit point total in Gilbreath’s USC career, which has been plagued by a variety of injuries.
According to senior center Kari LaPlante, who scored a season-high 15 points against Cal, Corral and Gilbreath have been key to USC’s offensive revival.
“It definitely helps us offensively … for Stefanie to get back in and do so well, and for [Corral] to find her stroke,” LaPlante said. “It’s exciting for the team and it relieves pressure from the post.”
The Sun Devils won the first meeting 62-61 in a game that marked the first home loss for the Women of Troy.
“We just came out very slow against [Arizona State] at home,” Corral said. “Their [defensive] pressure got to us. This time we have to focus on playing with poise, running through [their pressure] and getting to our offense.”
Senior guard Dymond Simon is the only Sun Devil to average double-digit points with 14.2 per game and also leads Arizona State with 2.7 assists per game.
The team currently owns a record of 16-9, and has four more games in the regular season, plus the Pac-10 tournament, to reach 20, the magic number.
Throughout the season, USC coach Michael Cooper has said that 20 wins will probably get the Women of Troy a bid to the NCAA tournament.
“We know our ultimate goal [of making the tournament], and we want that really, really bad,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos.

Through 27 games, trying to guess which USC men’s basketball team will show up to the arena has become an exercise in futility.
Will it be the team that took the court last weekend and easily dispatched both Bay Area schools on the road for the first time since 1992?
Pressure · Freshman guard Maurice Jones, who scored 22 points for USC against Cal and 10 against Stanford, will need to play just as well tonight. - Brandon Hui | Daily Troja 
Or will it be the team that squandered a season full of promise by dropping six of nine Pac-10 contests between Jan. 13 and Feb. 12?
In a season where instability has reigned supreme, if the Trojans (15-12, 7-7) can hang their hat on one positive pattern, it’s their ability to raise their level of play when the stakes are the highest.
Whether it was their two-point loss at then-No. 3 Kansas, their nail-biting upset of then-No. 18 Tennessee in Knoxville or their 73-56 drubbing Dec. 5 of a Texas team that is currently in the top five in the country, the Trojans have thrived under the brightest lights this season.
Tonight they will once again be thrust into the spotlight, when the No. 10 Arizona Wildcats (23-4, 12-2) come to the Galen Center.
Led by sophomore forward and former USC recruit Derrick Williams, second-year coach Sean Miller’s squad currently sits atop the Pac-10 conference standings heading into its second matchup with the Trojans at 7:30 p.m.
Williams is the likely front-runner to win this year’s Pac-10 player of the year award, pacing the Wildcats’ rise to national recognition with 19.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and an NCAA-high 9.27 free throw attempts per game.
On Saturday, the La Mirada, Calif. native secured Arizona’s last-second 87-86 victory over Washington not with his offense, but with a remarkable, game-saving block that quickly made the rounds on highlight shows everywhere.
Williams might be garnering most of the attention on the offensive side, but Arizona’s balanced scoring attack is aided by sophomore guard and former USC recruit Lamont Jones (9.7 PPG and 2.6 APG) and junior guard Kyle Fogg (8.4 PPG and 2.9 APG).
For USC, a recent lineup change by coach Kevin O’Neill added a noticeable spark to what had become a stagnant and predictable offense.
During the Trojans’ successful two-game trip last weekend at California and Stanford, O’Neill replaced freshman guard Maurice Jones with senior guard Donte Smith.
Jones, who started the team’s previous 25 games, seemed to hit a proverbial wall in his freshman season, averaging just 7.8 points and 4.4 assists per game in USC’s five games leading up to its Bay Area trip.
Coming off the bench for Smith, Jones scored 22 points with five three-point baskets in USC’s 78-75 victory over Cal on Thursday.
He then proved his one-game performance was not a fluke by scoring 10 points in the team’s 69-53 rout of Stanford on Saturday night.
But if the Trojans are to knock off the Wildcats in their second-to-last game at the Galen Center this season, junior Nikola Vucevic (17.1 points and 10.2 rebounds per game) will have to match the offensive intensity of his esteemed counterpart in Williams.
In USC’s three previous games against ranked teams this year, Vucevic has averaged only 13.6 points and six rebounds per game.
The Trojans conclude the home portion of their season Saturday afternoon against the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-16, 2-12).
Prior to the 4:30 p.m. contest, there will be a Senior Night Ceremony for guards Donte Smith and Marcus Simmons and forward Alex Stepheson.

I pretty much wrote off the USC men’s basketball team a while back, thinking it had two chances at making the NCAA tournament — slim and none.
But after defeating UCLA at the Galen Center in early January, I thought this year would be different.
A weak conference coupled with the play of midseason transfer guard Jio Fontan and the emergence of junior forward Nikola Vucevic, had given the Trojans life.
They clobbered then-No. 19 Texas at home (Texas is now No. 5 in the nation), went to the wire at No. 3 Kansas and eked out a victory at then-No. 19 Tennessee.
This all happened within a two-and-a-half week stretch, and I felt this was the year the basketball program had a legitimate shot to be dancing in March.
Then Oregon and bottom-dwelling Oregon State defeated USC. The Trojans followed up an empty road trip alternating wins and losses in their next four games.
Inconsistent play, an ineptness to solve a zone defense and an inability to make free-throws were their most glaring weaknesses.
That summed up the first half of conference play, and the second half didn’t start off any differently — a loss at UCLA and a home split with the Oregon schools made USC’s chances look even bleaker.
Then, after Valentine’s Day, something changed.
Maybe the USC basketball players were re-energized with all that chocolate, or maybe USC coach Kevin O’Neill had a change of heart.
Senior guard Donte Smith was inserted into the starting lineup and freshman guard Maurice Jones came off the bench for the first time all season.
And it worked.
Jones poured in 22 points off the bench, sparking USC to a 78-75 victory. At one point in the second half, he scored 16 points in just under six minutes.
With the win, the Trojans snapped their eight-game losing streak.
Next up: The Stanford Cardinal.
For the second consecutive game, Jones came off the bench and Smith was once again the starter.
It worked again.
USC convincingly defeated Stanford 69-53, and for the first time since 1992, it swept the Bay Area schools.
And for the first time since January 2008, the Trojans won back-to-back road games.
One simple lineup change translated to two wins on the road, and arguably two of USC’s most complete games this season.
The Trojans were in eighth place in the Pac-10, but now they sit in a tie for fourth place in the conference with Oregon.
With No. 10 Arizona and Washington still on its schedule (two teams that are projected to make the NCAA tournament), USC can bolster its resumé for the selection committee assuming it wins.
Pending these results, along with the games against Arizona State and Washington State, USC could receive a bye in the opening round of the Pac-10 Tournament.
And depending on their performance in the tournament, the Trojans have a shot at reaching 20 wins, which is the measuring stick for teams looking to punch their ticket to the Big Dance.
Now, it’s conceivable to think it’s possible.
I like what O’Neill has done, too.
Though Smith certainly gives the team a scoring threat off the bench, moving Jones to a sixth-man-type role changes the whole dynamic of a game.
His speed changes the tempo of the game and I see his role as literally a sparkplug off the bench.
The move also puts Fontan into more of a facilitator’s role, but also leaves Smith to do the same one thing O’Neill wants him to do: shoot.
As opposed to having basically two point guards (Jones and Fontan) in the backcourt, Smith spreads the floor with his shooting ability, and gives more room for Vucevic and senior forward Alex Stepheson to operate in the post.
As a whole, this move changes the entire complexion of the starting lineup, and it has certainly shown up in the stat sheet.
Since the change, Vucevic has averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds, while Stepheson has averaged 12.5 points and eight rebounds — both stats exceed their season averages to this point.
With the improved play of their two big men, along with rejuvenated guard play, the Trojans might be sniffing the finish line.
And despite all its troubles on the court (beating a zone defense, free-throw shooting) and off the court (guard Bryce Jones transferring), USC is certainly keeping its NCAA tournament hopes alive with its recent play.
The Trojans were down, but don’t count them out just yet. As the old adage goes, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.
Now, USC is certainly making a case with its play to finish strong and dance its way into March.
“In the Zone” runs Thursdays.  To comment on this article visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Trevor at trevor.wong@usc.edu. 
There is only one chance the team has of making the big dance. Need to win the last four games of the conf. schedule plus 1st round of the Pac-10 tourney to get to 20 wins if that will be enough. Beating Arizona tough enough
at home let alone sweeping in the state of Washington. Better bet to get an invite to the NIT still in doubt.

For the everyday college student, Twitter is the modern-day soapbox.
It is a place to express opinions, vent frustrations and share information. For most, it is raw, unfiltered thought, a forum for people to give their take on anything, often without consequences.
But for college athletes, the stakes are much higher. Often the highest profile students at their schools, athletes are seen as representatives of the entire institution. Twitter and other forms of social media might be a soapbox for them, but with one important difference.
When an athlete says something potentially inappropriate on Twitter, a lot more people take notice.
As a result, Twitter has meant trouble in recent years for some student-athletes at major universities. If athletes are getting attention for things they posted on Twitter, the publicity is rarely positive.
“Twitter has been both a blessing and a curse for anyone with a public profile, especially athletes,” said Jeff Fellenzer, who teaches Sports, Business and Media in Today’s Society at USC. “It allows you to connect directly with friends and fans, but the accounts are monitored now by mainstream media and team or school officials. This can be potentially damaging for athletes when they react with emotion and without a filter.”
The list of Twitter transgressions continues to grow. Last week, Auburn defensive back Jordan Spriggs reportedly attempted to solicit someone to write a paper for him. He tweeted: “man, who is good at writing papers?????????? I pay …”
Last year, University of Pittsburgh football player Elijah Fields was dismissed from the team for posting pictures of multiple bundles of cash on his Twitter account. One of the captions read: “Never knew Football was gon get me all this money. Sike I knew haha.”
Other examples include last year when Kentucky basketball player Josh Harrellson criticized coach John Calipari over Twitter. He was reprimanded and banned from using the social networking site. Mississippi State basketball coach Rick Stansbury banned his entire team from Twitter earlier this month because of a similar incident.
The majority of athletes’ tweets are harmless, but some, like the examples above, reflect poorly on schools. This has forced athletic departments and coaching staffs around the country to address the issue with their athletes. Some football programs, such as Boise State and Miami (Fl.) have banned athletes from using Twitter altogether while the season is in session.
USC, however, has no official policy regulating student-athletes’ Twitter use. Instead, like many schools, the university provides all new student-athletes with advice on how to use social networking sites appropriately. USC’s method is education rather than elimination.
“We believe students have First Amendment rights, that they are students and they do communicate through Facebook and Twitter and those other social media things,” said Tim Tessalone, the director of sports information at USC. “The main thing is that we say, ‘Be smart. Understand that because you’re a USC student-athlete, what you post on any of those types of sites has a greater impact than you might think.’”
Tessalone said there is always a chance the policy could change. But he also said the university understands that student-athletes will make mistakes.
“College is a time where you learn to make correct decisions, including what your online presence is,” Tessalone said.
Players’ Take on Twitter
Matt Barkley | Daily Trojan
For USC sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and UCLA sophomore safety Dietrich Riley, Twitter provides a safe and controlled avenue to connect with fans.
“I don’t really post straight-up tweets, like ‘this is what I’m doing’,” Barkley said. “But it is a fun way to interact, and I have quite a bit of followers so I enjoy interacting with them and sharing similarities.”
Likewise, Riley enjoys seeing the enthusiasm from the fans, alumni and the student body.
“Fans are really passionate and they really take a lot of pride in their school. It’s always good for me to get back at fans and just have a cool conversation with them,” he said.
Barkley and Riley both agree Twitter provides them more control over their interactions with fans and others online.
“On Facebook, if you do something wrong, say you comment on someone else’s picture, all your friends are bound to find out what happened because it shows up on their news feed,” Riley said. “[On Twitter] you can have it be private.”
Barkley and Riley understand they are high-profile figures. They are both very selective about what they post online.
Riley went so far as to say he treats it like he’s talking to the media, which, in a way, he is.
“We’re in L.A., we’re in a social media market,” Riley said. “So whatever you say, everyone is going to find out. So you must be able to represent yourself with character.”
Barkley said he thinks a lot about what he puts online.
“[The other night] I was debating if I should even start telling people about my Risk game,” Barkley said. “I’ve definitely held back on posting certain things because it might provoke wrong thoughts.”
Both players said their respective schools and athletic programs have talked to them about the need to exercise caution.
“Once incoming freshmen stepped foot on campus, we had a meeting,” Riley said. “They were talking about the disadvantages and the advantages to having Twitter.”
Barkley said he sees the potential danger of USC’s loose policy, but prefers being held accountable for his tweets rather than restricted.
“It is kind of a risk they’re taking, but in the grand scheme of things we are responsible,” Barkley said. “They don’t tell us what not to do but they do guide us, tell us to be smart. We’re smart enough to realize that whatever we post could hurt not only us but the whole team.”
Riley said being aware of future repercussions was also essential.
“You must be aware of your surroundings, wherever you’re at,” he said. “This stuff could really hurt you at the end.”
Fellenzer said Twitter’s informal nature sometimes trips up student-athletes. It is easy for them to forget that what they say is being read by more than just their friends and family.
“Your emotions can really get exposed on Twitter,” Fellenzer said. “Once it’s out there, once one person can see it and re-tweet it, then it can still go viral.”
Riley knows firsthand how Twitter can get your name in headlines for the wrong reasons.
Last month, Riley tweeted: “congrats to Coach Mike Johnson for joining the UCLA program and becoming our Offensive Coordinator.” The school had not yet officially announced Johnson’s hiring, nor had it parted ways with current offensive coordinator Norm Chow.
Riley said he saw the headline announcing Johnson’s hiring on Scout.com, assumed it was a fact and “automatically posted a tweet.” Riley received a text soon afterward from a UCLA media relations person.
“They just told me we’re not associated with Scout.com, so anyone can put anything on the Internet [even if] it’s false information,” Riley said. “If coach Neuheisel doesn’t quote it, if it doesn’t come from his mouth, then it’s false.”
The incident ended up being a learning experience for Riley. A similar situation arose a few weeks later when he heard UCLA had hired Joe Tresey as its defensive coordinator.
“I wanted to say congratulations or whatever but I wanted to make sure it was actually accurate,” Riley said.
Once Riley saw the news on UCLA’s official page, it was like a green light. He immediately posted a congratulatory tweet.

Leading up to last night’s game, USC coach Bill Ferguson expressed no concerns about his team’s ability to focus.
Fielding a veteran lineup that has both won games as underdogs and dropped games when heavily favored, the Trojans, with experience, have built their team identity this season around a collective passion and intensity.

As expected against a younger and inexperienced Cal State Northridge team, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (9-1) swept its third consecutive match, 25-21, 27-25, 25-19.
In what could have been pegged as a ‘trap’ game for the Trojans against an unranked, sub-.500 opponent, they managed to bear down and win three competitive sets on the road, winning for the first time in their last nine chances at the Matadome.
“To be honest, it wasn’t the easiest game to get the adrenaline flowing for,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin, who padded his impressive 12.06 assists per set average with an astounding 45 assists on Wednesday night. “There weren’t a lot of fans, and the building wasn’t the most aesthetically-pleasing place, but it was a crucial win for us.”
The heavy hitters from USC’s match against Pacific, senior outside hitter Tri Bourne and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, were rejoined once again by senior opposite Murphy Troy after his one-game hiatus due to the stomach flu.
All told, the trio combined for 42 of the Trojans’ 53 kills on the evening, terrorizing the Matadors’ porous defense.
“We thought they were going be susceptible to the back row quick attack, but they stopped us right away with that,” Ferguson said. “We did a nice job of changing on the fly and adjusting to that. At the beginning of the match, Northridge did a good job of blocking the middle, so we went outside with our hits.”
What handicapped the team for most of the game, however, was shoddy production from the Trojans’ servers.
The Trojans had to overcome 16 service errors compared to just two aces, both delivered by Troy.
In fact, at some points the service game faltered so much that the Trojans had to bring in a serving specialist, redshirt junior libero Brad Keenan, to help revitalize the attack.
“It was an off night [for the service game],” Ferguson said. “We have to do better serving on the road and be more consistent. Some of our errors were deep errors which means we were just missing. Our team’s volleyball IQ is so high that sometimes we over-think things. In some instances, [Troy] and [Ciarelli] tried to thread the needle a little too much.”  
A few minor mistakes in executing hits and serves aside, the Trojans accomplished a feat they have not for years.
They were able to close out tight sets in a manner which eluded them against Pepperdine. Their next test will come at No. 6 Long Beach State tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

USC received a notice of allegations from the NCAA on Wednesday concerning coach Lane Kiffin’s 14-month tenure at the University of Tennessee.
After a 22-month investigation into the Volunteers’ football and men’s basketball programs, the NCAA cited Kiffin for a failure to promote an atmosphere for compliance, a failure to monitor and impermissible recruiting activities.
“We have received from the NCAA a notice of allegations against Lane Kiffin pertaining to his tenure as the head football coach at Tennessee,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden in a statement. “The NCAA enforcement process provides for Tennessee and Lane to address those charges. Until that process is completed, it would be unfair and premature for me or USC to comment on this matter.”
Kiffin, as well as Tennessee, has 90 days to respond to the allegations before the hearing with the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions, which is scheduled for June 10 and 11 in Indianapolis.
According to a 26-page document released by Tennessee, Kiffin and his Volunteers coaching staff failed “to promote an atmosphere for compliance within the football program and [failed] to monitor the activities regarding compliance of several assistant football coaches.” One of those coaches might be current USC recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron.
From Jan. 3 through Jan. 9, 2010, Kiffin and his staff made impermissible telephone contact with five recruits — a total of 16 calls spanning 47 minutes.
Additionally, Kiffin allowed a recruiting intern, Steve Rubio, to accompany him on a recruiting trip to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., despite forewarning from the school’s football operations department.
On that trip, Rubio allegedly made “in-person, off-campus contact with high school administrators,” which, since he was an intern and a non-authorized off-campus recruiter, is a violation of NCAA rules.
“This trip and these contacts occurred after David Blackburn, the institution’s director of football operations, informed both Kiffin and Rubio on or about Oct. 10, 2009, that Rubio was not permitted to enter a high school’s property while accompanying a football coach on a recruiting trip,” the NCAA said.
Rubio, however, is an alum of the high school.
“We have received the notice of allegations,” Kiffin said in a statement. “On the advice of my legal counsel, we cannot comment other than to say we look forward to working through the process with the NCAA.”
In spite of the allegations, Haden’s support of Kiffin has not wavered in the slightest.
“Since his return to USC last year as our head football coach, Lane has been vigilant in making sure he and the football program follow the NCAA’s rules and compete the right way,” Haden said. “Lane has my support as our head football coach.”

Members of Alpha Delta Chi, USC’s Christian sorority, are currently house hunting.
ADChi members have been living at 1207 29th St. for four years, but after their former property manager failed to inform the new manager that the sorority wanted to renew its lease, the sorority must now look elsewhere for a house.
Goodbye · The girls of the Alpha Delta Chi sorority were notified in February that the new property manager had not continued their lease. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
“There was a change in property managers, and I guess the fact that we wanted to stay in the house just got lost in between,” said ADChi President Megan Mullis.
When Ashlee Humphrey, ADChi’s house manager, contacted the new property manager earlier this month, she learned the property manager had allowed others to sign a lease for the house. Humphrey said the new manager was never told that the sorority wanted to renew its lease.
“When I first called them, I was confused because I was so unsure of how that error occurred,” Humphrey said. “So, the first thing I thought was confusion as to how we don’t have a house anymore all of a sudden.”
Humphrey added she wasn’t angry, but was more concerned with finding a new house for the girls to live in.
“I started getting worried thinking of where the girls are going to live,” Humphrey said. “I’m not sure if I was really angry — I think my first thought was just, ‘What’s going to happen?’”
The sorority is currently pursuing a number of options for housing but does not have anything concrete yet.
Though the members are upset about the loss of their house, Mullis said she and the rest of the girls are maintaining positive attitudes.
“It’s already been uniting us over the loss with the search for something new, and it’s really caused us to be united in our trust of God and in prayer for a new house,” Mullis said.
Although Humphrey said she has grown quite attached to the house after living there for the last two years, she is looking forward to the possibilities a new house might bring.
“At first, I was a little sad because I’ve grown really attached to the house,” Humphrey said. “In the end, I’m excited because it means more girls will probably be able to live in.”
Siobhan Brugger, a sophomore majoring in music and health promotion and disease prevention studies, said she wants to live in the new house with the girls for the first time next year.
“We could be sad about it, but I know that the future is bright and I’m just excited for ADChi and what’s ahead,” Brugger said.
Humphrey said although the final housing decision will be made by both her and Mullis, they are still trying to involve all of the girls in the search process.
“So far, some of us have gone walking through the neighborhood looking for a house. We want to get input and make everyone involved in this,” Humphrey said.
Moving closer to The Row is another factor the girls are considering.
“We’d love to be closer to The Row, and be more involved there and grow relationships with other houses,” Brugger said.
The girls were told they have to be out of their current house by July 31. Mullis said they hope to move into their new house as soon as possible.

The beeps in the background during phone calls with family members constantly remind Heba Abdelgader, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), of the civil unrest in Libya.
Abdelgader, who was born in the United States, savors the time she has to talk to her family members in Libya, despite a beep throughout the conversation that tells her the government is tapping her call. Her conversations with family members typically last only one to two minutes.
Abdelgader’s parents recently moved back to Libya because of the recession, and are now caught up in the protests taking place there.
“Just recently they moved back to try to find new economic opportunities because of the bad economic situation in the U.S., and now they’re stuck in a revolution,” Abdelgader said.
Libya has been engulfed in turmoil since Feb. 15 when protests began against dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi, who has held power since 1969. The government responded to the protests with violence that shocked many.
“He’s not going to leave without inflicting every last bit of damage he can,” Abdelgader said.
The protests have been organized through e-mails and social media for almost a month, and have been primarily centered in Tripoli, the nation’s capital, and Benghazi, the second-largest city in Libya.
Abdelgader said her family has not been very active in the protests for fear of their safety.
“My mother’s been staying in the house. Someone has to stay at home because there have been reports of people breaking in,” Abdelgader said. “My dad and brother have been involved, but not as intensely as the people you see in the news.”
Qaddafi has brought in mercenaries from Zimbabwe, Chad, Sudan, Korea and Bangladesh to silence the protestors. They were given swords, guns and artillery weapons, which they have used to murder civilians, according to the Washington Post.
“In Tripoli, around Feb. 21, anybody out in the street or involved with the protests was being shot at,” Abdelgader said. “In Tajura, every time someone was shot, someone else would go try to pick up that body in order to bury it, and they were shot as well. Bodies literally started to pile up on each other.”
Qaddafi has claimed that the protestors are on drugs, bribed some civilians with cash and weapons to protest on his behalf and attempted to cover up the government’s violence, according to Rahma Abdelgader, Heba’s sister, who is currently in Tripoli and a witness of the events .
“Qaddafi removed all evidence of what has been going on,” Rahma Abdelgader said. “They even burned the bodies of people who had been killed in the streets. There are no funerals.”
In some places, however, protesting civilians have been aided by the military.
“The military joined the civilians,” Heba Abdelgader said. “They didn’t want to kill their own people. It would be like Americans killing Americans.”
Many, including the prime minister of Italy, have claimed that Qaddafi has lost hold on the eastern part of Libya, Qaddafi refuses to step down and the situation is worsening for those people who are in need of food and medical aid.
Heba Abdelgader is one of nearly 3,500 Libyans living in the United States, Canada and Europe who have started a group on Facebook called “Libyans” to get information to present news from Libya to the rest of the world.
“These are people with connections to any kind of information,” Heba Abdelgader said. “Everyone has been contacting their families who have then been messaging them pictures and videos of what’s going on.”
Heba Abdelgader said the turmoil in Libya has affected her life as a student.
“This is the most overwhelming situation I’ve ever had to deal with. Professors have been very understanding and thoughtful,” she said. “It’s very hard to live my everyday life knowing my direct family is at risk.”
Heba Abdelgader, however, has been busy contacting as many people and organizations as possible, including the news media, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and the American embassy in Libya to inform people about what’s occurring in Libya.
“I’ve never been this active about anything in my life,” Heba Abdelgader said. “Americans need to do something on behalf of the U.S., because the U.S. has done nothing so far aside from condemn Qaddafi’s actions.”
USC students interested in helping can petition and donate money through groups on Facebook, such as “Wear Red for Libya.”
Although Heba Abdelgader said Although Heba Abdelgader said she believes it will be difficult to change a government that has been occupied for so long by a dictator, she believes the people of Libya are ready for a democracy.
“I’m not sure when, but I think Qaddafi will be out. There’s too much political unrest,” Heba Abdelgader said. “This revolt has been long overdue.”

The best way to encourage students to attend class is to make sure lectures provide added value, student fellows of the Center for Excellence in Teaching said at a panel discussion Wednesday.
Attendance · Members of the Center for Excellence in Teaching suggested that teachers go beyond just using textbooks and refer to current events or pop culture in their lectures to encourage student attendance. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan 
The panel discussion, which was moderated by James Green, CET undergraduate fellow, included Becky Courter, a CET teaching assistant fellow, Joseph Dombrosky, the CET undergraduate fellows chair, and Colby Kennedy, a CET undergraduate fellow.
CET held the panel to receive feedback from students about attendance and to provide extra resources for professors who want to improve class attendance.
“There are three primary issues for students,” Green said. “Lack of interest in the class, lack of engagement insofar as participating and getting involved and lack of added value, in that students don’t feel their class experience is adding to their required textbook readings and the other parts of the course.”
Green said students can be classified into three categories: those who will attend class no matter what, those who never attend class and those who are somewhere in  between. The students who are in between often feel they have better things to do than attend class.
“They don’t feel the class is worth going to. Or [they have] other assignments or quizzes,” Green said. “It’s important that [faculty] create an environment that really encourages students to come to class.”
Some students said they have a difficult time going to class when they feel the information is verbatim from the textbook.
“What is the most productive way that I can spend my time,” said Frankie Bennett, a senior majoring in business administration. “When a professor is really interesting, of course I’ll be there every time. But when I’m being taught something I could learn faster outside of class, then it doesn’t make sense for to me to go.”
Courter said CET is trying to provide extra resources and ideas for professors to improve attendance. It falls on the professors, however, to care about attendance, and on the university to provide incentives for those professors to care.
“As a teacher if you care about your students, then you care if they show up,” Courter said.
TAs often play a large role in engaging students in the course content because they teach discussion sections that expand on professors’ lectures to a smaller number of students.
Courter said she tries to stay as comfortable as possible when she is teaching because she believes it makes students feel comfortable, too.
Wayne Glass, professor of international relations, said classroom attendance supports a healthy educational system.
“I want my classes to be exciting and active,” Glass said. “In some sense, that’s being successful; it’s a measure of my own success as a professional.”
In classes where attendance is high, professors encourage class discussion and interaction give frequent quizzes and assign small group work to replace powerpoint lectures, according to Green.
CET encourages professors and TAs to focus on adding value to their lectures by getting students interested in the subject through the use of varied media, such as the internet, pop culture and news articles that cater to student interest.
“Find a way to encourage students to learn more outside of class,” Green said. “You want to encourage students to come to class — not just to fulfill an attendance grade, but to learn.”

Winter. The air is crisp, Adam Sandler has a new movie in theaters and reports of a snowbound New York City stream through every news outlet. On nights like these, a crackling fire and a tall glass of beer can put the perfect spin on an otherwise bleak season. 
But what beer is ideal for the cold months? Nutty, brown ales and oatmeal stouts are the obvious winter drinks in density and malt content, but for those who can’t wait for beach season to commence, consider India Pale Ale.
Crisp, heavy on the alcohol and almost sadistically packed with hops, IPA is no halfhearted beer. Its very mention can inspire both shudders and sighs of elation. The legendary brew first rose to prominence with its 17th century production on East India Company ships, as the strong hop content ensures a longer lifespan for the beer.
If IPA was enough to sustain the crustiest of English sailors through typhoons and scurvy, surely it has a place in Los Angeles’ growing beer culture.
For connoisseurs, or those tired of tossing back a Blue Moon on Thursday nights, the wild world of IPAs is ripe for exploration. Here are four choice brews to begin with, depending on the conditioning of your taste buds.
Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA – Gaithersburg, Md.
Winner of the Gold Medal at the 2008 Stockholm Beer & Whiskey Festival, this widely available, world famous IPA is known for converting those afraid of the delectable hop burn. Here, the bones of the beer are far maltier in nature, offering a dainty sweetness of raisins and molasses that offsets the fury of hops perfectly.
A smoky shade of copper when poured into a glass, the 90 Minute IPA still wields that classic aftertaste of citrus and other tart fruits that generally define IPAs as a summer beer.
Though Dogfish Head only represents the gates of a thrilling class of beer, this particular brew could easily sustain one’s thirst for IPAs alone. The 90 Minute IPA can be found at Traddie’s, BevMo and other specialty beer stores.
   
Victory Hop Devil IPA – Downington, Pa.
A strange but indispensable IPA, this infamously bipolar beer from Pennsylvania’s Victory Brewing Company is the only one that I can confidently call “spicy.”
Aptly named for its fiery hop content, the Hop Devil reveals an elegant amber shade when poured but packs a sensorial wallop.
Lighter on citrus and packed with unique floral flavors, the beer’s initially vicious taste slowly reveals surprising hints of strawberries and caramel. By the first sip’s end, the Hop Devil becomes surprisingly sweet, more than most IPAs.
Like the fiercest of lovers, the Hop Devil can be a struggle to endure, but its nectarous climax is worth the ride. It can be found at BevMo.
 
Harpoon Leviathan Imperial IPA – Boston, Mass.
A masterpiece worthy of Sarte and Bertolucci. Whether you’ve tried one of Harpoon’s many beers or remember the brewery logo from The Departed’s numerous Boston sets, their Leviathan Imperial IPA is pure magic.
All the classic flavors are present, from the grapefruit peel down to the freshest of pine trees and evergreens. The 10-percent alcohol level gives the beer an unexpected kick, but its mouth-wateringly foamy head offsets this jolt with an inherent creaminess not found in most IPAs.
Whether on the slopes of Big Bear or on the beach at sunset, the Leviathan Imperial IPA is a beer of all seasons, sharp enough to satisfy the masochists and sweet enough to lull newcomers into bliss. Though sometimes hard to find beyond New England, it has appeared in California beer stores during the winter months.
 
Green Flash West Coast IPA – Vista, Calif.
If Dogfish Head favors a full body union of sweet and bitter flavors, the good folks at Green Flash err on the hoppier side of IPAs.
Their West Coast IPA is a brilliantly tart concoction, spiked with much grapefruit zest and even heavier on the pine scents.
The first sip feels wrought from the green earth itself, albeit in the most pleasantly aromatic way. Thankfully, the intense blast of plant flavors slowly surrenders to a soothing aftertaste of citrus, tropical fruits and even a hint of mint.
Green Flash can make a dishy companion for those planning camping trips. As a beer, it belongs in the same school as those naturally fermented root beers some might have traumatic memories of sampling in science classes.
Thankfully, Green Flash wields  more in flavor than Professor Quackenbush’s chemistry kits.  The West Coast IPA is readily available on tap at The Lab Gastropub.
All good choices but Pliny the Elder  and Stone IPA should be added. Although Sculpin might be my favorite. For something local try the many yummy ones for Eagle Rock Brewery.
Dogfish Head, a good choice all by itself.  And don’t forget Racer 5, another great IPA.

In recent years, the U.K. has arguably proved superior in producing female powerhouse crooners with fresh means of dominating the billboard charts such as Adele, Duffy and, of course, the illustrious Amy Winehouse.
American contender · Lauren Pritchard makes an authoritative first impression on the homefront with her debut album Wasted in Jackson. - Photo courtesy of Bobbie Gal 
Stateside, America has put forth a worthy effort of its own, delving into this soulful singer/songwriter genre with the emergence of artists like Rachael Yamagata and Alison Sudol from A Fine Frenzy. Still, none have come close to the global success of their British counterparts.
The game might change, though, with the arrival of a serious contender on the scene: Tennessee native Lauren Pritchard.
At the ripe age of 23, Pritchard sings with the eloquent soul of someone who has lived to see it all, and done it all as well.
Her debut album, Wasted in Jackson, is comprised of 11 short tracks that give a glimpse of her deepest desires, innermost secrets and painful past relationships.
Although the lyrics are not groundbreaking, Pritchard injects a tenacious quality into every word she sings, taking these would-be formulaic songs into a fresh and empowering realm.
The titular and standout track of the album, “Wasted in Jackson,” is a brutally honest insight into wanting to leave a deadbeat town. Pritchard sings, All I hear is stick around / Everybody gets wasted in Jackson / I don’t wanna waste in Jackson. The combination of her stirring and powerful vocals laid over the poppy melody of the album uplifts the somber premise of the song.
Pritchard cites legendary crooners like Al Green and Carole King as some of the influences behind her style. Indeed, her expansive musical tastes of soul, jazz, R&B and blues are vividly reflected through her own work. Incorporating catchy jazz piano riffs and a string ensemble, her quirky love song “Stuck,” the second single off her album, plays like a modern take on Green’s “Let’s Stay Together.”
Listeners can expect a whole spectrum of emotionally charged and sing-a-long worthy tracks from the punchy “Not The Drinking,” which deals with the end of a relationship, to the more upbeat and light-hearted “I Hope It’s You.”
Besides detailing relationships gone awry and situations beyond her control, Pritchard delves into more deeply-rooted issues in the track “Painkillers,” which, as the name suggests, explores the darkest moments of a person’s struggles with the most legalized drugs on the market.
But I know no painkillers make it go away / I tried it once before and it didn’t work for me / work and there’s no painkillers make it go away / if I tried to overdose / it would bring no change, Pritchard cries, lending the song a mournful resonance.
After leaving her home at a very young age, the road to Pritchard’s musical career has neither been the easiest nor the most conventional. While her peers were still attending high school, Pritchard was picking up odd jobs to fund her passion, including singing vocals for a reggae band and auditioning for roles in the musical theater circuit.
Most notable for playing the role of the teenage runaway Ilse in the coming-of-age hit musical Spring Awakening, Pritchard might have easily pursued a successful Broadway career or tried her hand at an acting job in Hollywood like ex-cast mates Lea Michele, Jenna Ushkowitz and Jonathan Groff, all of whom have joined the cast of Glee.
Instead, after a two-year run on Broadway, Pritchard has reclaimed her original dream of becoming a bona-fide musician.
Although her vibrato might be similar to some of today’s most soulful vocalists, including Adele and perhaps even Sia, Pritchard’s aesthetic is more a throwback to the 1990s golden era of female singer/songwriters. Her penchant for emotionally stripped yet unapologetic tracks comes off as a generous ode to some of the great lyricists of that era, from Fiona Apple to Alanis Morissette.
Pritchard’s talent is undeniable, and her debut album showcases more than just a pretty girl who can sing. It is a no-holds-barred and unreformed introduction to rival that of any competition from across the pond.

The caramel color found in cola drinks such as Coca-Cola is contaminated with carcinogens, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit consumer advocacy group.
The type of caramel coloring used for sodas isn’t what might come to mind when you think of the word “caramel.” Instead of simply melted or cooked sugar, “type IV” caramel coloring, the type used in sodas, is a combination of ammonium and sulfite compounds.
According to the CSPI’s report, this production method results in the creation of 2-methylimidazole and 4-methylimidazole, both of which are carcinogens,  cancer-causing agents shown to promote lung, liver and thyroid tumors in laboratory tests on mice and rats.
Here’s the million-dollar question, though: How much should we care?
Cancer is obviously a terrible and pervasive disease. But the running punchline with studies on carcinogens is that seemingly everything causes cancer. Am I seriously supposed to consider the fact that Wendy’s french fries are known to have carcinogens as a result of their browning in oil? That’s probably the last point on a long list of things I should worry about when eating fast-food fries.
Though the threat of carcinogenic foods might be very real, it seems consumers would benefit from taking a step back to analyze such news, rather than immediately buying into researchers’ findings.
It’s easy to get sucked into this type of consumer-as-victim news. My dad, for instance, always loves to spread the latest news of common consumer products resulting in illness or death. He called me last week, knowing that I had long ago taken a liking to Diet Cokes.
I figure there have got to be others like my dad out there, so, for the sake of unsure or misinformed consumers everywhere, this news needs to be put into context.
Although lab findings of tests performed on animals can be informative, the bottom line is still that humans aren’t mice (or rats). A laboratory researcher will point out that mice and rats work quite well as human analogues, as we have many of the same methods of processing chemicals and so forth.
But even assuming this is true, there are usually very significant differences between the tested experiences of lab animals and real human experiences.
The CPSI found statistically significant results in the group of “high-dose” male mice, which received a daily average dose of 170 milligrams of 4-methylimidazole per kilogram of body weight. The tests were conducted for 106 weeks.
If I had gone through the test, considering my body weight of around 73 kilograms, to achieve the same statistically significant results, I would have had to take an average dose of 12,410 milligrams of 4-MEI daily. Taking into account the average 20- ounce bottle of cola has about 200 micrograms of 4-MEI in it, I would have had to drink 62,050 20-ounce bottles of Diet Coke every day for 106 weeks to replicate test results.
And this is assuming that I react the same way as a mouse.
By so urgently and insistently connecting caramel food coloring to cancer, the CPSI is not simply raising awareness of a potential problem. It is fueling the “everything causes cancer” punchline, with the side effect being that jaded eaters stop caring about the truly important specifics of what’s in their food.
The presence of carcinogens in our cola is an important problem, but hitting the panic button without a balanced and realistic analysis, as the CPSI and various news outlets seem to be doing, is irresponsible. In all likelihood, it’s that tasty high-fructose corn syrup that’s going to kill you, not 4-MEI.
Even Michael Jacobson, the executive director of the CPSI, conceded that.
“Because 2- and 4-methylimidazole do not appear to be highly potent carcinogens, the 10 teaspoons of obesity-promoting high-fructose corn syrup in a can of cola should still be considered a much greater health risk,” he wrote on the Huffington Post.
Sometimes, it’s hard to draw the line for what news about food we should care about. We as consumers should strive to keep food manufacturers honest and accountable. But the subject of carcinogens often requires perspective. Should we be notifying our friends that our grilled burgers “might cause cancer” because they were cooked over a flame, which can create carcinogens, as well?
Like it or not, eating well requires thought and awareness. It pays to know who is making your food and how they’re making it. But it also pays to know when to not sweat the small stuff. The most recent caramel-color-cancer story is shocking and a great headline, but not much more.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I could go for a Diet Coke right about now.
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Food As Life,” runs Thursdays.
You worthless corporate suckup bastard, how much money did you get to publish coca colas point of view, I seriously hope that you get a taste of your own medicine and rot in hell.
Actually the black grilled meat does cause cancer , so yes you should be aware and tell your friends, the feel good poster fails to cite any scientific evidence or study and dismisses the concern, this is evident in that the author ignores well researched articles that note that broiling red meats is cancerous, less for poultry, none for veggies.
Since the author is wrong on that fact and then concludes should we say as well,  this is sheer ignorance. Its true that CPSI has its controversies and that the concentration of  an ingredient does play a role, but color is used to make a product look better, you should realize that natural ingredients can be carcinogenic too, however the math the person has used may be way off.

Sustainable food limited
Here’s something that should make you lose your appetite:  Only 6 percent of food served on USC’s campus is purchased from local producers.
Even less is organically grown or raised. The bread on that sandwich you’re eating likely came from a factory in Ohio, the meat from a slaughterhouse in Kansas and the tomato … well, who knows?
Recently, many USC students learned that eating sustainable foods — whether local or organic — is beneficial to the environment, farmers, ranchers and eaters.
Money spent on produce, meat and bread spurs the economy of your region and has a drastically lower footprint on the environment, since it does not need to travel by truck thousands of miles to reach your dinner plate.
Moreover, local food tends to come from small-scale growers rather than larger corporate growers who exploit their workers almost worse than their livestock.
Eric Schlosser, the co-producer of the hit documentary Food, Inc. and author of Fast Food Nation, and Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, emphasized these points in their lecture at Bovard.
Unfortunately,  the Visions & Voices event Feb. 9 was basically our university’s most expensive investment in sustainable food.
USC might have hosted sustainable food advocates, but in actuality it is doing little to progress the very movement it claims to champion.
Sustainable food on our campus is nearly nonexistent. Students can purchase pastries from the local Homeboy Bakery at Shop Café, organic snacks from the Law School Café or natural salads at Popovich. Meanwhile, roughly 30 percent of the food served at Lemonade is sustainable.
USC students have few sustainable food options outside of these limited venues.
Other universities, meanwhile, are winning the food fight for tastier, fresher and more sustainable dining options.
At the University of California, Berkeley, students can eat at Crossroad’s, an entirely organic dining hall.
Imagine if Everbody’s Kitchen served nothing but organic food.
Meanwhile, at Stanford, almost half of the school’s dining produce is organic or regionally grown.
Even UCLA is increasing organic and local options for its students and faculty.
Last week, USC’s Director of Hospitality, Kris Klinger, stated he wants to purchase the majority of our campus’ food from local markets.
The most effective way to accomplish Klinger’s goal is to convert one of USC’s many eateries into a fully sustainable restaurant.
Other universities have done just that with the widespread approval of students’ taste buds.
Just last month, the University of Pennsylvania opened Joe’s, a café serving fresh, local, seasonable produce and naturally raised meats. Ronald Tutor Hall Café and other venues have the infrastructure to achieve the same. But nothing is being done.
Let’s create a difference you can taste. We students are hungry for change.

Sophomore, political science
We had David Galaviz, USC’s Executive Director for Local Government Relations, on Platforum USC Issues Friday night (2/25), and I seem to remember he said something about trying to work more closely with the weekly Farmer’s Market to supply some food to the cafeterias.  So maybe things are on the way up…
I think it is really important to look where our food comes from and be a leader in sustainability.  Thank you Nick for bringing this issue to attention.
Nick,
I am a friend and fan of your dad’s, and he forwarded me your letter.  Excellent work!  Your letter is the exact same letter that I would have written!  Please keep up the great work, and tell your mom and dad that I am really proud of what you are working towards.

1924 was a banner year for USC. The university held its first formal homecoming ceremony, inaugurated the first school of international relations in the country and, on a stifling Wednesday in June, gathered to hear its first female commencement speaker, Aurelia Henry Reinhardt,  give her remarks.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
It is doubtful that the woman once dubbed, with subdued enthusiasm, “as distinguished a Unitarian as there is in the land” was a barn-burning orator, but that’s beside the point.
USC, a school whose very first valedictorian was a woman, a school that currently has a nearly 1:1 ratio of female to male students, a school whose female athletes have secured 23 national championships, was making a promising first step toward acknowledging the contributions of its female students.
Unfortunately, nearly a century has passed and except for a few lateral moves, USC has stayed in the ’20s.
Last week, USC announced that the main speaker for its 128th commencement ceremony will be Microsoft C.E.O. Steve Ballmer, a man known for his clout, wealth and almost frightening ebullience at speaking events.
You can find examples of his oratory styles on Youtube: Two of the most popular videos, “Steve Ballmer going crazy” and “Dance Monkey Boy,” feature him bounding around the stage like a bulldog in moonboots, screaming, “I LOVE THIS COMPANY!”
But Ballmer’s enthusiasm is not on trial here.
Since California’s foremost Unitarian spoke in 1924, a mere five women have been keynote speakers at the main commencement ceremony.
Reinhardt’s successor was Nancy Banks, who spoke at the 1973 midyear commencement (USC discontinued midyear ceremonies in 1981).
In the next decade, there was a spurt of female speakers — 1976, 1980 and 1983.
Twenty years after that, and most recently, Ruth Simmons, president of Brown University, spoke at the 2003 commencement ceremony at what she called — seemingly for lack of a better word — the most “exciting” university in California.
Since Simmons spoke, USC has grown beyond Simmons’ faint praise into a formidable university, in both academics and community.
It’s unfortunate, then, that despite the strides we have taken in rankings, prestige and diversity, our  women’s lib is still not up to snuff.
It’s certainly not for lack of successful Women of Troy alumnae.
Even if confined to Ballmer’s wheelhouse, there are presidents of publishing houses, a former Goldman Sachs chairwoman and C.E.O.s of numerous companies.
Outside of business, there are movie producers, actresses, national news anchors.
America Ferrera, Lisa Ling, Macy Gray — Trojan alumnae everywhere. And brushing past school loyalties, the country can still be plumbed for a first lady, female secretary of state, Oscar-winning director, etc.
They’re out there, to be sure.
Although obtaining a proportionate number of female speakers would be a nice feather in the university’s cap, there are certainly reasons other than knee-jerk feminism to revisit the selection process next year.
A female speaker could add a fresh perspective that has been lacking in some recent speeches.
After all, fame doesn’t guarantee public speaking skills, or even the ability to properly use the word “juxtapose.”
Some of our most famous speakers have been duds.
Former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner spent most of his 2000 address promoting the proliferation of a new–fangled technology called “electronic mail.” In 1998, Bill Cosby rather humorously berated the valedictorian for being a show-off.
As for Ballmer, we’ll just have to wait and see, and pray he doesn’t jump into our grandmothers’ laps.
And so, President Nikias, trustees, faculty, staff, esteemed guests and, of course, the Class of 2011, we wait in hope that the university changes its selection criteria and next time picks a speaker that represents the diversity of this university.

got hope? saruh palen for precedent 2012!!
Why can’t we promote a speaker who is a white, christian, man…is there a problem with that? Where is the tolerance?
I’m a woman and woman are irritating with harping on men all of the time. If it wasn’t for them this planet would be nothing……Women need to shut up and stop trying to be like men all of the time. CREATE your own without picking on what men do or don’t do…
Great research and point well made.  USC should care enough about promoting egalitariannism in all aspects of it’s university business
People need other things to be concerned about.
this is so true. usc needs a woman presence at commencement. one would hope that with a woman provost that things will start to change around her, especially because our new provost is a vibrant and outspoken leader for women’s rights and participates in gender studies and cfr events. however, year after year, man after man, we get the same looking speaker saying the same type of message. a woman would definitely be a nice change of pace. i would encourage us all to not this read this article and forget about this important message. instead demand more diversity for our commencement speaker. maybe this can be an issue the program board assemblies can work on. just a thought. we’ll let’s see who we get next year. maybe an out lesbian?! Ellen? naw, USC’s not ready for that one yet. baby steps
Congrats on a well-written article, and I totally agree. USC, how do you pick these speakers? Is there even a channel for any student input that any of us even know about? :(
you should contact the office of protocol and events..there is a planning committee that assists…i don’t think students sit on this panel if so probably someone from USG…a new president was elected…i would suggest contacting him and making this an issue…protocol link: http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/specialevents/commencement/contact.php

However cliché it sounds, college life is a time to meet people, develop relationships, try new things and generally enjoy the last four years of sheltered life before making the leap into the real world.
The first two years of university life should revolve more around college as a unique experience, instead of being dedicated purely to studying.
The last two years should focus on gaining useful job experience for life after graduation.
This divide might sound pointless, considering college students are adults and should be able to make their own decisions.
Unfortunately for today’s generation of college students, the amount of pressure placed on us to bolster our resumés throughout our four years of undergraduate study acts as an unavoidable hindrance to our remaining years of youth.
I’m not trying to say that our nation’s college populus should buy beer instead of textbooks.
If we do not enjoy ourselves now, however, we might find ourselves regretting our decisions when we are left to fend for ourselves in the “real world.”
Though I by no means consider myself an excessively proactive member of my class, I still managed to secure an internship, join the club ice hockey team and start my own student-run film production team by the end of my freshman year.
I have loved the experience I’ve gained from these activities, but when my schoolwork is piled on top of all of this, I end up with little or no free time to simply enjoy being in college.
I am only a sophomore, yet I already feel like a seasoned veteran of the workforce.
I am constantly overworked, held sleepless and forced to guzzle unhealthy amounts of caffeinated beverages  to complete all of my work.
Once midterms come around, I enter a semi-conscious caffeine-induced stupor.
The only times I get to relax and spend time with my friends are the few minutes between closing my textbook and passing out on the third floor of Leavey Library.
This needs to stop.
College students are almost obligated to sacrifice the last few years of their youth if they want any chance at finding a job after graduation.
According to one MSNBC article, one in five college students endures stress all or most of the time.
If college students do not attempt to reclaim their youthful bliss now, their work ethic will fizzle out when it actually matters: post-graduation.
With the help of the USC community, I am confident we can reclaim our waning youth.
Though most of this reclamation has to come from the individual, perhaps the college administration can make a strict divide between freshman/sophomore students and junior/senior students.
When students are inundated with “Career Day” and “Internship Fair” e-mails seemingly every day of the week, it is only a matter of time before any normal person’s conscience kicks in and youthful bliss turns into forced corporate grind.
If USC’s administration were to send these career-enhancing opportunities to just juniors and seniors, allowing freshman and sophomores to sign up for e–mail notifications at their own discretion, students would be more likely to enjoy the full  college experience.
Meanwhile, if such a policy were enacted, students will not be forced to deal with the gnawing sensation that we should be constantly enhancing our future careers. Instead, we can take time to wholeheartedly enjoy the college experience.
By encouraging underclassman to limit their extracurricular focus to strictly on-campus activities, USC could help students break from the stress’s grasp during the four years that should be the most enjoyable of our lives.

USC received a notice of allegations from the NCAA on Wednesday concerning coach Lane Kiffin’s 14-month tenure at the University of Tennessee.
As a result of the NCAA’s 22-month investigation into the Volunteers’ football and men’s basketball programs, Kiffin has been cited for a failure to promote an atmosphere for compliance, a failure to monitor and impermissible recruiting activities.
“We have received from the NCAA a notice of allegations against Lane Kiffin pertaining to his tenure as the head football coach at Tennessee,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden in a statement. “The NCAA enforcement process provides for Tennessee and Lane to address those charges. Until that process is completed, it would be unfair and premature for me or USC to comment on this matter.”
Kiffin, as well as Tennessee, will have 90 days to respond to the allegations before a scheduled hearing before the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions in Indianapolis is held on June 10-11.
According to a 26-page document released by Tennessee, Kiffin and his then-Volunteer coaching staff  failed “to promote an atmosphere for compliance within the football program and [failed] to monitor the activities regarding compliance of several assistant football coaches.” One of those coaches might be current USC recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron.
From Jan. 3 through Jan. 9 2010, Kiffin and his staff made impermissible telephone contact with five recruits – a total of 16 calls spanning 47 minutes.
Additionally, Kiffin allowed a recruiting intern, Steve Rubio, to accompany him on a recruiting trip to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., despite forewarning from the school’s football operations department. On that trip, Rubio allegedly made “in-person, off-campus contact with high school administrators,” which, as an intern and a non-authorized off-campus recruiter, is a violation of NCAA rules.
“This trip and these contacts occurred after David Blackburn, the institution’s director of football operations, informed both Kiffin and Rubio on or about October 10, 2009, that Rubio was not permitted to enter a high school’s property while accompanying a football coach on a recruiting trip,” said the NCAA.
Rubio, however, is in fact an alumnus of the high school.
“We have received the notice of allegations,” Kiffin said in a statement. “On the advice of my legal counsel, we cannot comment other than to say we look forward to working through the process with the NCAA.”
In spite of the allegations, Haden’s support of Kiffin has not wavered in the slightest.
“Since his return to USC last year as our head football coach, Lane has been vigilant in making sure he and the football program follow the NCAA’s rules and compete the right way,” Haden said. “Lane has my support as our head football coach.”
