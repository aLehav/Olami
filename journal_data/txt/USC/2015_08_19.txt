In the latest in a series of events that spell trouble for the Roski School of Art and Design’s M.F.A. program, esteemed Roski professor Sharon Lockhart resigned last week, further illuminating  the abhorrent structural issues within the program and reviving the conversation concerning the value of a graduate art education.
Lockhart’s resignation comes at the heels of the withdrawal of Roski’s entire M.F.A. Graduate Class of 2016 last spring in protest of various bureaucratic changes within the administration and the program they had initially enrolled in. Now infamously dubbed the “Roski Seven,” the students do not plan on returning, even after Dean Erica Muhl attempted to address their concerns in a letter sent as a response to the students’ initial dissent. In fact, the students responded by circulating a petition via Change.org that mandated Muhl resign, an appeal that has received more than 800 signatures.
The students’ choice reflected that their trust in the school they first enrolled in appeared to be nothing but a pipe dream, ruined by several changes made by administration. In addition to changing the name from the Roski School of Fine Art to the Roski School of Art and Design, a choice that illustrates the ever-increasing preference of design to fine art within higher education, several key faculty members have recently left and the curriculum has switched from emphasizing studio visits to emphasizing criticism and theory.
The fact that several professors — some even tenured — chose to leave the school abruptly in the last year and a half indicates massive internal problems within the school. Though Muhl said that the curriculum has been changed to meet the requests of the students, the fact that they will not return does not provide much confidence in Roski moving forward. The fine arts program itself was once highly regarded, but in light of the nationally covered news of the Roski Seven, it’s hard to imagine that the school’s name hasn’t been tarnished at least in some respect.
The students’ choice to leave their graduate degrees unfinished also begs the question if a degree is needed at all in order to be an artist in 2015, considering that many artists in both history and pop culture today have made a successful living without going to school for their craft. As tuition continues to rise and student debt comprises one of the most prominent issues in the 2016 presidential debate, the risk of student loans post-graduation does not appear to be worth it for some after all.
Additionally, as ever-expanding internet platforms continue to produce scores of talented new musicians, writers, directors, performers and artists every day, the need to tout a degree on a curriculum vitae is less important. Perhaps in more esteemed and private art circles nationwide the need for a degree is still relevant, but today it seems that both undergraduate and graduate degrees are unimpressive.
Some might argue that graduate education is crucial. Indeed, as more and more students are choosing to go to college and obtain their undergraduate degrees — according to the National Center for Education Statistics, enrollment rates have increased 24 percent from 2002 — the need for an even more prestigious degree seems important. As more saw the need for a master’s, however, the job market became inundated and oversaturated with similar degree-holding candidates, causing a hysteria within the job market for young millennials and even those in Generation X. A tradeoff was then born: the degree that created massive debt or the self-made work in the studio that provided a steady job.
Perhaps, Roski must save face by doing the unthinkable: provide free tuition for the next fortunate — or unfortunate, depending on how you look at it — artists seeking their master’s degree. Considering that New York City’s famous Cooper Union College, one of the few colleges that formerly offered a full ride to those 8 percent of applicants who were admitted, has just recently required students to pay, offering free tuition might be the only salvation for Roski in the end. This choice would not only encourage young artists — who would have thought a master’s degree unattainable due to their financial burdens — to apply, but also convey to the general public that the administration has seen their errors and are looking to repair the damage.
Ultimately, the Roski Seven, in addition to shedding some much-needed light on the school administration, have brought up relevant and pertinent questions regarding the usefulness and relevance of art school today.

As the beginning of the semester brings a collective sigh to students as they cut their five-figure tuition checks, nationwide conversations about reducing the cost of college become more critical. Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders recently introduced a cutting-edge way to reform the affordability of higher education. The solution is simple: eliminate tuition costs altogether. Sanders’s “College for All” act would provide four years of free education to students attending public colleges and universities, a proposal that opens the door to many needed conversations about education reform and forces fellow presidential candidates to express their stance.
Sanders’s message resonates with those burdened by loans.
“We have a crisis in higher education today. Too many of our young people cannot afford a college education, and those who are leaving college are faced with crushing debt,” Sanders said in a speech to American University students. “This is not what America is supposed to be about.”
Sanders recognizes a very important point that other candidates often overlook: Financial pressure has the ability to debilitate academic performance. According to Edvisors, a website that analyzes how students pay for college, 71 percent of recent college students with a bachelor’s degree will graduate with student debt.
The class of 2015 is the most indebted graduating class in history. Each recent graduate will pay back on average $35,000. Higher education is becoming less affordable, and thus less attainable.
Sanders’s legislative proposal came after President Barack Obama’s guarantee to make the first two years of community college free. Under Obama’s plan, “America’s College Promise,” students could attend community college at no cost as long as they maintain a 2.5 GPA and attend part-time. Sanders’s plan, the “College for All” act would tax Wall Street transactions, direct revenue toward college tuition, lower interest rates and increase work-study. Though economists dispute feasibility, many agree that Sanders’s ideas will shape Hillary Clinton’s education platform. He may be able to wield this influence because he is one of the first presidential candidates to blatantly state his view on education reform. And his influence over his fellow presidential candidates will only strengthen as the election progresses.
“Sanders can have an influence in terms of the kinds of issues that get attention, get talked about and eventually get picked up by the candidate that does become Democratic nominee and potentially the next president,” said Matthew Chingos, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, to the International Business Times.
Following Sanders’s education bill, fellow presidential candidates are starting to announce their views on education reform. Hillary Clinton introduced a new plan for making higher education more feasible for students, and Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley proposed freezing tuition rates in public institutions.
One thing is certain. There is no clear consensus in either political party on how to rebuild the current education system. Sanders’s proposal, however, propels fellow presidential candidates to take a stance on education reform, thus increasing the chance of real education reform.
While notable communities such as Beverly Hills have started to crack down on their residents for excessive water consumption, the progress is too slow to warrant the continuation of the #droughtshaming fad. Fines might be a good idea, but if we want any serious results out of Southern California, the region needs more action. Perhaps the next logical step is in the hands of the local city councils — punishments beyond the water company fines. Cutting off water to certain wasteful areas or households could be the next step in water conservation efforts, however harsh it may sound, but maybe that is what it will take to reduce our water footprint while we still have the resource.
Watch “Ivory Tower,” the documentary. Universities are exploiting federal student loan funding. 
The student debt crisis is the next financial crisis. $10/hr. jobs with over 1T$ in outstanding student loans. Gotta love it.
Mar 24, 2012 – Since 1985, the overall consumer price index has risen 115% while the college education inflation rate has risen nearly 500%. There are laws against price gouging, enforce them.
Any scheme to shovel more money into the equation will merely allow colleges to increase tuition that much faster than the overall rate of inflation.

Musical festivals are in high demand during the summer, and there’s no better way to close out the season than with one last outing at FYF music festival before the start of the fall semester. The highly anticipated FYF Fest, taking place Aug. 22 and 23, will attract musical tastemakers to the Los Angeles Sports Arena and Exposition Park, right in USC’s backyard. This year, the assorted lineup has quickly climbed in ranking among the nation’s most popular music festivals, garnering both well-known artists such as Frank Ocean, Morrissey and Solange, and rising musical acts, like USC’s very own KXSC Fest headliner, DJ Dodger Stadium and the Los Angeles born duo, Girlpool.
Founded by Sean Carlson in 2004, FYF started out with the punk rock scene in Echo Park. The event, however, quickly outgrew its former locations The Echo and Los Angeles Historic Park — starting in 2014, it moved next door to the USC campus.
Last year’s festival was hit with varying issues, including long wait time that created a chaotic, bottleneck entrance for event goers. Poorly planned pathways to and from each of the stages forced people to walk excessively on concrete throughout the day. The arena faced capacity issues, which barred excited patrons from enjoying highly anticipated acts. The festival, however, has learned from last year’s struggles and made improvements.
Max Miceli, a junior majoring in architecture, attended the festival last year and thought the layout was problematic.
“People would essentially crowd around these two doors to the arena and flooded inside as soon as they opened it. They
were trying to keep people from jumping over barriers, and overall it seemed like they weren’t ready for so many people.”
Miceli, however, said that they layout did not affect his overall enjoyment at the festival.
“I don’t think the specifics of my festival affected my overall experience. I missed half a musical act, but overall it was definitely a really fun and cool festival with some really good artists,” Miceli said.
This year’s festival features a revamped layout, with new pathways so audiences can attend the acts they want without hassle. Less travel on foot means more time to enjoy acts in their entirety, creating better engagement between the artist and the audience. An additional stage adds more excitement and variety to the lineup, while an extended closing time of 2 a.m. allows festival-goers to enjoy this two-day event late into the night. FYF also extended and relocated the food vendor lineup to a better location, meaning shorter wait times and happier stage-hoppers. With these improvements, attendees can expect a more efficient festival flow, and direct their attention toward this year’s impressive musical menagerie.
Veering away from its punk rock roots, FYF’s lineups, over the years, have broadened the festival to multiple genres and expanded their reach to more music enthusiasts. Whether it is electronica, rock or modern soul, FYF’s lineup caters to the city’s hodgepodge of musical tastes. Acts like Deerhunter, Thee Oh Sees, Belle & Sebastian and Spiritualized will entertain rock lovers in the crowd, providing a perfect soundtrack to accompany the skies of a typical sunset. Or, enjoy a bit of Mac DeMarco, but take fair warning: listening to him can lead to relaxation and lounging, in contrast to the festival’s hyped up vibes.
For those interested in music to dance along to, DJs including Jon Hopkins, Kaytranada and BADBADNOTGOOD inspire audiences to move around and shuffle to their sounds. Another highly anticipated act is Australian-born electronic musician, Flume, who is most well known for spinning tantalizing beats. Nicholas Jaar, well known as half of the duo forming Darkside, is set to play a DJ set that will be equally as compelling. For soul-crooning goodness and fiery vocals, artists such as Solange and D’Angelo & The Vanguard will be rolling out some smooth tunes.         If not for the aforementioned musical acts, come for the critically acclaimed headliners. The first night’s main act, R&B singer and rapper Frank Ocean, has not released an album since 2012, but with a rumored new album on the way, perhaps he will give the crowd a sneak peak. The following night, Morrissey, the former lead singer of The Smiths, is a show that will reveal to audience members, if they don’t know already, the massive influence of the band on rock music.
With general admission tickets at $175, a much more budget friendly price than tickets to Coachella or Lollapalooza, FYF Fest presents an eclectic lineup that is sure to offer something for everyone. In addition to this year’s upgrades, this music festival will not disappoint.

As of Summer 2015, more than $4.5 billion of President C.L. Max Nikias’s $6 billion fundraising the Campaign for the University of Southern California has been raised. The campaign is projected by USC’s Advancement Services to reach the $6 billion mark by 2018’s fiscal year.
Advancement Services has made major advancements in academic endowment for students and faculty, building projects and capital. The Campaign is aimed at  giving the fundraised money back to the students by funding aspects that will increase their quality of education.
Currently, 52 percent of the money raised has gone toward academic priorities for an improved learning experience, 34 percent toward endowment to attract esteemed faculty and fund scholarships for students and 14 percent toward capital.
The campaign has already made a significant impact on campus, with projects such as the Wallis Annenberg Hall and the upcoming Village at USC.

Joy Ofodu, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she thinks the fundraising was used well.
“There’s nothing not to like about the new Annenberg building,” Ofodu said. “It’s amazing. It was incredible to be given this sort of gift. It’s really impressive, and I definitely think the fundraising was well put.”
According to the Council for Aid to Education, USC ranked third last year in fundraising successes, bested only by Harvard and Stanford.
USC has been able to perform well over the years because of the efficient infrastructure of Advancement Services. It ranges from local sources abroad to international resources.
The team has built up a fundraising staff of 450 members, double the amount of staff from when the Campaign started.
Tracey Vanich, vice president for Advancement Services, said the department will be even more determined during its final $2 billion push.
”That’s really the biggest thing: boots on the ground, going out, making visits and contacting people . . . But we’re going to be doing even more of that now for the next $2 billion of the campaign.”
The School of Cinematic Arts and the Athletics Department have already surpassed their campaign goals, and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and Sol Price School of Public Policy are at 70 percent completion or higher in their own campaign efforts.
Parents and alumni are a huge help to the campaign, donating a total of almost $3 billion to campaign efforts.
Around 280,000 donors have made campaign gifts to date, with about 89 percent of those donors offering gifts less than $1,000.
“I think part of this story is not always the transformational gifts, but what we always like to say is, ‘Look, there’s a lot of smaller gifts that make up the success of this campaign,’” Vranich said.  “I think that gets lost sometimes when you hear all of these big gift announcements, but that’s a really good impact story for the Campaign.”
Nerses Aposhian, a 2014 graduate, donated because he wanted to give back to the school he went to so it could continue to grow.
“I wanted to be a part of something bigger,” Aposhian said. “My contribution was less than .1 percent of the campaign, but I did feel like if there are individuals like myself that can’t give much but can give what they want or what they can, I think that can raise not only a lot of money, but it also shows that it’s not only the wealthy that fund this campaign. It’s people just like you and I that want to be a part of something bigger that want to continue this tradition and that want to see USC excel beyond what it already has in the last 125 plus years.”
The medical enterprise is going to be a top priority for the Campaign over the next two years in order to foster technological advancements in human health. In the Campaign, $1.5 billion has already been raised for health sciences.
Six major gifts, along with collective contributions of smaller donations, have allowed the Keck School of Medicine to improve medical education, research and patient care efforts.
“This extraordinary support is a tremendous vote of confidence in the work we do every day at USC,” Nikias said in a statement released by USC News. “It reflects the passion of our wider community and its immense desire to see the University’s scholarly and creative work benefit society.”
When USC reaches the $6 billion mark the Campaign efforts will not stop.
In the long term, the Campaign fund is set to increase USC’s average annual fundraising efforts.  Before the campaign began, USC averaged about $284 million a year. According to Advancement Services, USC has been averaging in the $800 million  range annually for several years of the current fundraising campaign.
“I think when we finish that $6 billon, what we want to be able to say is, ‘Now what is the new normal?’” Vranich said. “There is always at a university like this, ‘What is the next project, what is the next big transformational [project], what faculty members do we want or what do we want to do with research?’  Every single dollar that comes in here counts towards the campaign — it doesn’t matter where it goes, but it all counts.”

The USC Trojan Family lost one of its all-time greats earlier this summer.
Former USC All-American running back and football legend Frank Gifford passed away of natural causes Aug. 9 at the age of 84.
Gifford lined up primarily in the Trojan backfield from 1949 to 1951, earning All-American and All-Conference honors in his final season, before being selected in the first round of the 1952 NFL draft by the New York Giants. Gifford led the team in scoring, rushing and total offense in his last year with the Trojans.
“He was the ultimate three-way player,” Sarkisian said. “We lost a great Trojan.”
Current USC quarterback Cody Kessler is connected to Gifford. Both came to USC from the town of of Bakersfield, and Kessler roomed with Gifford’s son, Cody, a former USC walk-on receiver, during his freshman year.
“RIP to Trojan great and Bakersfield football legend, Frank Gifford. You have always been an inspiration to me in my football career,” Kessler tweeted.
In 12 years with the Giants, Gifford garnered eight Pro Bowl selections, one NFL championship ring and one NFL MVP award.
The Santa Monica native later transitioned into the broadcast booth and became a marquee voice of football, serving as a commentator on “Monday Night Football” for over 25 years.
Gifford’s legacy in football is cemented at every level. Gifford made his way into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977. The former Trojan was chosen for the first USC Athletics Hall of Fame class in 1994, and had his jersey retired by the New York Giants in 2000.
Gifford is survived by his wife Kathie Lee; his five children, Cassidy, Cody, Jeff, Kyle and Victoria; and his five grandchildren.
Sad to see Frank go, but like he told me before he left, it was the only way he could escape Kathie Lee’s boney grasp…

This fall, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance will welcome its first class of freshmen majoring in dance.
Despite students’ presence, the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center will not be open for another year. Instead, students will mainly practice in a renovated studio in the Physical Education Building.
Kaufman Vice Dean Jodie Gates said the building will be worth the wait.
“It is a beautiful space with ample light, high ceilings, a sprung dance floor covered with a marley flooring specific for dance classes,” Gates said. “This dance studio also includes a piano, new mirrors and ballet barres. We have also renovated an additional space in the Allan Hancock Foundation Building that serves Kaufman by providing a dance studio with a sprung marley floor, mirrors and new ballet barres for our non-major student population.”
Though having dance majors will be new this fall, the Kaufman School has served non-majors and minors for the past two years.
“Currently we have several programs and courses in technique, training and critical studies for non-majors,” Gates said. “Since the Kaufman School opened its doors in 2013, we have served the campus by offering theory and practical courses in a variety of dance styles and interests. We offer two minor programs including ‘Dance in Popular Culture: Hip Hop, Urban and Social Dances’ as well as a ‘Minor in Dance.’ Additionally, we offer General Education courses that begin in the fall and have over 1,000 students enrolled in dance courses each year and over 45 students minoring in dance.”
Rob Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School of Music and the Kaufman School of Dance, noted that not having the dance building has halted some non-dance major classes.
“The only disadvantage [of the Physical Education Building] is that we had to eliminate some classes for non-dance majors to make space for the majors,” Cutietta said. “We will bring those back when the new building opens.”
Cutietta further noted how Kaufman has partnered with both Thornton and the School of Cinematic Arts to help integrate its students into the greater USC artistic community.
“Dance majors will choose to work with musicians or filmmakers/animators in their junior and senior years to truly make great art. Also, all students will take one music and one cinematic arts class during their first two years,” he said. “These partnerships are very important and were embedded into the curriculum.”
This spirit of collaboration is something Kaufman has made one of its goals.
“One of USC Kaufman’s core values is to provide an interdisciplinary education within the four-year intensive program in preparation for a career as a professional dancer, a choreographer for stage or cinematic arts, or an artist exploring the relationship between dance and music,” Gates said. “USC Kaufman develops the artist, innovator and entrepreneur so the curriculum is designed to cross over with business and science as well as all the arts.”
Satori Folkes-Stone, a freshman majoring in dance, said that though she was nervous at first, talking to faculty and saw their determination to make the new dancers great.
“It was kind of scary for me in the beginning because I [didn’t] know what to expect,” Folkes-Stone said. “After time and after going to our first reception and meeting our faculty and hearing what their mission was for the school and program and us as dancers, I think I was really confident that because it’s the first class, we’re actually going to have the best experience because [the faculty is] so adamant about making us successful at the end of our four years.”
Though the Kaufman School has been serving dance students already, Cutietta noted that the pioneering freshman class is special because of how diverse and well trained they are.
“They are different because they are all gifted and trained artists in dance,” Cutietta said.“Much like the music majors, these students bring years of training with them that is unique to their major.”
Gates agreed, and also lauded the adventurousness, physical talent and boldness of these students.
“The first class of students all have a curious mind and are open to exploration. They have the obvious physical talent coupled with a unique signature style,” Gates said.“They are that hybrid dancer/athlete that will help us define the next generation of dance makers.”
Folkes-Stone said she feels like she made a good school choice.
“I feel very really confident that things are going to go well,” Folkes-Stone said. ”I feel like I’m in good hands.”

Just around the corner · Sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson had 49 tackles, 10 deflections and one forced fumble on defense in addition to his success as a wide receiver and kick returner in his breakout freshman season. – Daily Trojan File Photo
Entering the 2015 college football season, the Trojan football team’s secondary appears to be a source of strength for the defense. A much-maligned group last season, especially after losses to Arizona State and UCLA when defensive backs were repeatedly burned, the 2015 secondary looks revamped and reenergized. Led by standout corner Adoree’ Jackson and veteran defensive back Kevon Seymour, this year’s unit will be a tough test for quarterbacks in the pass-happy Pac-12.
“This year, I believe the secondary will be a great strength for us, especially when you have someone like Adoree’ out there who can impact a game quickly,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said.
Last season, the Trojans’ back four had to withstand the loss of All-Pac-12 cornerback Josh Shaw to suspension as well as All-American safety Su’a Cravens, who was moved to a hybrid linebacker and nickel back position. The loss of these stalwarts left the secondary in flux and susceptible early in the season.
“We had growing pains in the secondary last year as we played a lot of youngsters who got better as the season went on,” Sarkisian said.
Right away, though, Jackson emerged as a shutdown corner, which gave the unit a much-needed boost as the season progressed.
This year, the script is flipped completely. Jackson comes in with one full year under his belt, and if recent practice is any indication, he will cut the field in half for opposing quarterbacks. On the other side is Seymour, a speedy veteran who has wowed coaches thus far in the summer sessions with his aggressiveness and physical play. Seymour, a local product out of Muir High School in Pasadena, has battled through injuries and inconsistent play throughout his tenure, but it looks as if he is finally putting it all together entering his final season as a Trojan.
The two cornerbacks will be buoyed by a plethora of young, talented safeties. Leon McQuay III is back for his junior season, and though he had some issues against UCLA last season, his athleticism and physical presence will earn him some time on the field. He will be part of a platoon to start the season with sophomore John Plattenburg, who impressed late in the season last year and continued his strong debut into the spring and summer sessions. Additionally, redshirt sophomore Chris Hawkins, who recently converted from corner to safety, will also vie for playing time.
The Trojans are both deep and young, as they have three highly touted freshmen who could play right away in the secondary. Prized recruit Iman Marshall is a physical defensive back who has already made waves with his play at cornerback. Additionally, the dynamic duo of freshman safeties Marvell Tell and Ykili Ross looks to be an imposing combination for the next few years.
This depth is a source of pride for the Trojans, who have struggled with injuries in the secondary in years past.

There is no doubt that Cody Kessler will be a focal point for the Trojans this season, and with him will be arguably one of the strongest offensive lines in the country. The line will return not only every starter from last season, but also their most valuable reserves.
The centerpiece of such a strong group also doubles as the actual center in senior standout Max Tuerk. All eyes will be on Tuerk as the season kicks off and he prepares to prove his readiness for the NFL.
The 6-foot-6 center has been placed on the watch list for the Lombardi Trophy, college football’s annual award for the best interior player. In addition to this award, Tuerk is also on the watch list for two others: the Rimington Trophy for top center and the Outland Trophy for top lineman.
Tuerk will be one of the Trojans’ most versatile players, with the ability to play any position on the line. The four-year starter played tackle and guard before eventually being moved to center last season, where he earned All-Pac-12 first-team honors.
“I think Max is the best center in the country,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said.
To complement Tuerk will be two first-team All-American freshmen returning as sophomores in Toa Lobendahn and Viane Talamaivao. Lobendahn played the first eight games of the 2014 season at left guard before transitioning to left tackle for the remainder of an injury-plagued season. Talamaivao started in the Trojans’ final 11 games as the right guard.
Both starting tackles will return for USC in juniors Chad Wheeler on the left side and Zach Banner on the right. Wheeler, who missed the final five games of the 2014 season with a knee injury, has been a two-year starter for the Trojans.
Sophomore guard Damien Mama will be returning for USC this season with four starts under his belt. He started the first two games at right guard, and ended the season by starting the last two games at left guard.
Another returner for the Trojans is sophomore Khaliel Rodgers. Rodgers is a center but versatile enough to play other positions along the line, as he demonstrated in three late season starts at left guard.
Last season, the team suffered from an injury-plagued line, but with every player expecting a full recovery, the offensive line should be able to reach its full potential.
“We are fortunate that all of our starters are back this year, as well as some players returning from injuries and some really good newcomers,” Sarkisian said.
Last year’s rough season for the Trojans could turn the team into one of the deepest and most versatile sets of offensive linemen in the country.
“I love our line’s overall athleticism, toughness and attitude, plus its versatility and depth,” Sarkisian said.
The line will be working under new offensive line coach Bob Connelly, who has 20 years of coaching experience.
“You have to be able to run the football, protect the quarterback and I think we can do that,” Sarkisian said.
Connelly’s most recent coaching job was in 2014 at Oklahoma State, but Connelly has also coached the offensive line at Arizona State, Washington State, UTEP and Alabama.
Connelly is familiar with Pac-12 football and has been able to improve the running game at each of his previous schools, and USC should be no exception.

The LGBTQ community has overcome many feats within the last year, most notably the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage following a Supreme Court decision in June. Though the legal rights of gay and lesbian citizens have been expanding in the United States, the fight for equality is far from over for the transgender community both nationwide and here at USC.
With the tremendous amount of coverage transgender activists have garnered this year, the trans movement has finally secured its placement in mainstream media. On July 15, TLC premiered the new reality series I Am Jazz, detailing the daily life of transgender teenager Jazz Jennings. Less than two weeks later, E! network debuted I Am Cait, a reality series documenting the gender transition of Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner. The premiere followed Jenner’s widely publicized Vanity Fair cover in June.
Even so, compared to the support that the gay and lesbian communities have received, many of us often forget about the ‘T’ in LGBTQ. And though the public seems to have become more tolerant of trans issues, transgender individuals deserve more than blind tolerance. The needs of all trans people must be provided before equality is met. Though Jenner’s Vanity Fair cover was met with overwhelming praise, the majority of comments were directed toward her “beauty” and physical appearance — as Jon Stewart stated on The Daily Show in regard to the public’s reaction: “Welcome to being a woman in America.”  At the risk of belittling Jenner’s valor, it must be noted that Jenner represents a small portion of the transgender community; Jenner’s financial privilege allowed her to acquire the expensive medical treatment necessary for transitioning, a luxury that many transgender citizens do not have.
Applauding Jenner’s “beauty” without first acknowledging her needs propagates the message that we only accept and validate our transgender citizens when they appeal to our society’s beauty binaries. Many transgender celebrities and allies have spoken out in regard to this stigma.
“There are many trans folks because of genetics and/or lack of material access who will never be able to embody these standards,” said Laverne Cox, actress and transgender advocate, in response to Jenner’s Vanity Fair cover.  “More importantly, many trans folks don’t want to embody them, and we shouldn’t have to be seen as ourselves and respected as ourselves.”
John Oliver devoted a segment on his show Last Week Tonight to transgender rights, arguing that we glorify transgender individuals on their “bravery” while simultaneously ignoring their demands. Indeed, we have established an unjust dichotomy between providing moral support and rejecting their needs when it makes us uncomfortable.  No two trans people or experiences are the same, just as no two cisgender — people whose gender identity agrees with their assigned sex at birth — individuals are.  If you’re unsure of what a trans person needs, ask — individually and respectfully.
Though some businesses and organizations are just now beginning to demonstrate their support for the trans movement, USC has already done a fair job in considering its transgender students — though there is definitely room for improvement.  The university’s LGBT Resource Center has done tremendous work providing for trans students. The USC Student Health Insurance Plan incorporates transgender medical needs under its coverage, which includes “clinician visits, medication, surgeries, diagnostic testing for pre-op and more.”
In addition, the University has established trans-friendly housing, including the Rainbow Floor in Century 2 Apartments, as well as single-residence housing, and has mapped all the gender-neutral restrooms on campus. However, though these on-campus offices serve our transgender students, the administration itself does almost nothing to advocate or promote LGBTQ rights. Evan Pensis, a senior majoring in piano performance and linguistics, expressed his disapproval regarding the administration’s lack of involvement in LGBTQ issues.
“Professional organizations for trans people have low to no visibility on campus,” Pensis said.  “The representation of trans in USC advertising and marketing is nonexistent.”
Pensis, who is also involved with RISE Alliance and the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion on campus, challenges the administration to speak up on trans rights.
“I urge USC and President Nikias to position themselves differently…To define leadership not in what’s been done before for trans and queer students, but to demonstrate leadership that respects and supports our LGBTQ students and allies.”
USC is notorious for its inconsistency regarding LGBTQ activism. It took five years and many legal battles for USC’s first Gay Student Union to be recognized as an official student organization in 1975. With the new school year upon us, it is imperative to stand together and demand that the administration speak out on these matters. President Nikias and the Board of Trustees must break the silence regarding trans-related issues. USC should vocalize support for the trans community and ensure that their comfort and safety are being met. Not all students wish to be confined to the gender binaries the school unconsciously places on campus. Trojans are not just “men” and “women”; we represent a wider span of individuality that should be acknowledged and celebrated.

The words “Southern California” and “national champions” have long been paired together. The Trojans are among the top 10 winningest teams in college football history. The impressive win count has been spurred by a long line of elite quarterbacks. The legacies of Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart, Mark Sanchez and Matt Barkley will forever be remembered in USC and college football history.
Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler is the latest play caller with a chance to lead the Trojans back to the national championship game. He enters the 2015 season on the heels of a breakout junior campaign in which he completed nearly 70 percent of his passes, setting a school record. His 39 touchdown passes tied Barkley’s 2011 record, and his 3,826 yard total was just shy of Palmer’s 2002 record.
“He has a chip on his shoulder, and I expect him to have another outstanding season,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “He has good vision and smarts, delivers a very accurate ball, is mobile, is able to make quick decisions and does a great job of leading our offense.”
Heisman hopeful · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler is considered to be a preseason candidate for the Heisman trophy. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Kessler has received some preseason Heisman buzz, and the Trojans are again ranked in the preseason top 10, but this scenario seems all too familiar. Barkley and the 2012 Trojans were the preseason No. 1 only to finish the season 7-6.
The 2015 Trojans, while still highly praised, do not enter the season with the same hype as the 2012 team. Kessler and the Trojans are still somewhat of an underdog with a lot left to prove. Though last season ended with a lot of promise, it was far from perfect.
The Trojans suffered their first loss at the hands of unranked Boston College and went on to lose to Arizona State, Utah and UCLA and had less than impressive wins over Arizona and Cal. Still, the Trojans’ 9-4 record will likely be a thing of the past.
Despite his record-breaking 2014 numbers, Kessler was never the best quarterback in the Pac-12, or even the most-talked about player on the team. UCLA’s Brett Hundley and Oregon’s Marcus Mariota were the dominant quarterbacks in the conference, and rightfully so. Mariota went on to win the Heisman trophy and Hundley handed USC a 38-20 loss.
NFL-bound wide receiver Nelson Agholor received a lot of buzz in 2014, as did breakout stars wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson and outside linebacker Su’a Cravens. Despite his success, Kessler seemed to always fly under the radar. The upcoming season should prove to be a different story.
Hundley and Mariota have both turned pro, leaving the Pac-12 wide open. USC will play both Oregon and UCLA in 2015 and has a chance to end a three-year losing streak to the Bruins. Kessler will be without Agholor, but Smith, Jackson and Cravens will all return and will be joined by one of the top recruiting classes in the nation.
Kessler and the Trojans have a lot to prove, as does head coach Steve Sarkisian, who is looking to improve upon his 9-4 record. But that seems to be the difference between the 2012 Trojans and the 2015 Trojans. The current team has a chip on its shoulder and has disappointing losses to avenge and more to prove. The Pac-12 is Kessler’s to win.
Taking the Pac-12 is far from an easy task, as emerging young quarterbacks Jared Goff and Anu Solomon look to rival Kessler for the top spot in the conference. However, Kessler’s experience as a three year starter gives him an edge over the newcomers.
“It’s always an advantage to have a senior quarterback leading your team,” Sarkisian said. “Nobody ever has had the kind of season Cody had last year and went as unnoticed as he did, but that serves as a great reminder for him this season.”

USC station · The Expo Park/USC Metro station, part of the Expo Line, is located directly across the street from Trousdale Parkway, making it easy for students to utilize L.A.’s public transportation. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Hollywood, sunny beaches and the Dodgers are just a few of the things Los Angeles is known for. What isn’t it known for? Stellar public transportation. For years, the city’s public transportation system has had a bad reputation, causing most Angelenos to rely on their cars without a second thought.
However, at just $1.75 per ride, the Los Angeles Metro offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to driving. The Metro light rail system is comprised of six lines primarily spreading across the metropolitan section of Los Angeles.
Additionally, the Metro is currently working to combat its limited access through several large extension projects. These include expanding the Gold Line to the Inland Empire, the Expo Line to Santa Monica, the Purple Line to Westwood and the Green Line to LAX.
So before you open your Uber app, check and see if where you’re going is Metro accessible. Here is a guide to where each line can take you.
Expo Line:
As the only line with stations directly next to USC, the Expo Line is crucial in Trojans’ public transportation use. Two stops, Expo Park/USC and Jefferson/USC, are easily accessible from campus. Take the Expo Line up to the 7th St./Metro Center station to peruse the FIGat7th shopping center, or to transfer to the Red or Purple lines to go further downtown. In the other direction, the Expo Line heads toward Culver City. And, starting in 2016, the line will give students a quick trip to the beach by extending all the way to downtown Santa Monica.
Red Line:
In order to access the Red Line from campus, students must take the Expo Line to the 7th St./Metro Center station and transfer. The Red Line provides access to Pershing Square, where students can grab food at Grand Central Market. It also goes north toward Hollywood, bringing riders to popular tourist and entertainment destinations including the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Universal City. On Saturdays and Sundays, passengers can take a shuttle directly from the Red Line’s Vermont/Sunset station to the Griffith Observatory.
Purple Line:
The Purple Line runs parallel to the Red Line until the Wilshire/Vermont station. While the Red Line continues north along Vermont Avenue, the Purple Line heads west along Wilshire Boulevard, eventually stopping at Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue. Both the Purple and Red Lines connect to Union Station, Los Angeles’ major transit hub, which is within walking distance to Olvera Street and Chinatown. They also stop at Civic Center, home to many cultural and political destinations, such as City Hall, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Gold Line:
The Gold Line, starting at Union Station, contains a diverse array of offerings. The line’s southern leg stops in Little Tokyo, Chinatown and the Arts District. The Little Tokyo/Arts District stop brings visitors to the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, beautiful murals in the historic Arts District and the Geffen Contemporary Museum, which is connected to MOCA. Heading north, the line goes through Pasadena, where Metro users can find more art in the Norton Simon Museum or window-shop along Colorado Boulevard.
Blue Line:
The Blue Line shares two stops with the Expo Line: 7th St./Metro Center and Pico. The Pico station’s primary draw is L.A. Live, which includes the Staples Center, the Grammy Museum and many dining options. The Los Angeles Convention Center is also nearby. The Blue Line runs south through Compton, where riders can exit at 103rd Street and admire the historic Watts Towers before continuing into Long Beach, which boasts the Aquarium of the Pacific.
Green Line:
The Green Line seems most removed from the heart of Los Angeles — it doesn’t directly connect to Downtown or Hollywood, instead running east to west in South Los Angeles. In order to reach the Green Line from USC, riders must take the Expo Line up to the Pico Station then take the Blue Line right back down until it meets the Green Line at Imperial/Wilmington. However, the money saved on an expensive airport shuttle may be worth the triple-train trip.
I’ll be taking the expo line from Culver City. Its great.

Fancy footwork · Senior midfielder Jamie Fink started all 21 games as a junior en route to earning All Pac-12 honors and will look to help her team back to the NCAA tournament in her final season. – Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
The USC women’s soccer program may not be ranked in the NSCAA Division I national preseason top 25, but there is a serious chance that the Women of Troy will be in the mix for the national title this season.
The team’s 2014 season came to a screeching halt in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, as the Women of Troy were close to advancing but fell to Pepperdine on penalty kicks following a 1-1 draw. Losing a penalty shootout in the NCAA Tournament is as painful as it gets, but it often makes a team stronger in the long run.
USC appears to be ready to make the leap from a top-tier team to a true national title contender. It would not be the first time such strides were made in the program’s history.
In 2007, the Women of Troy won the National Championship, the first and only national title USC has captured since the program’s inception in 1993.
That being said, it is not merely blind optimism leading the wave of positivity surrounding the 2015 installment of USC women’s soccer. The pieces are in place.
It all starts with second-year head coach Keidane McAlpine, a veteran who guided the Trojans to a 12-6-3 record in his first season at the helm. McAlpine made his way to Troy from Washington State, where he was named Pac-12 Coach of the Year in 2013 for his outstanding work with the WSU Cougars.
Exactly one-third of the Trojans’ roster is comprised of seniors, meaning there will be no shortage of experience and leadership in the locker room this season. The squad also welcomes a talented batch of freshmen, all in-state products with the exception of Swedish import Olga Langenskiöld.
Savannah Levin, a junior who is capable of playing in the midfield or up top, praised the team’s camaraderie as the 2015 season approaches.
“I am really excited for this season because the team’s chemistry on and off the field continues to grow,” Levin said. “Having a tight-knit team makes you want to compete for each other that much more.”
Looking back at the Trojans’ 2014 season, something is immediately apparent: McAlpine and company sure knew how to take care of business in non-conference play. The team opened with nine non-conference games, losing just one of those fixtures and outscoring their opponents 29-7 in the process.
One of the team’s most impressive wins of the 2014 season came in the form of a 2-1 win against Notre Dame in South Bend. The Irish claimed the No. 9 ranking in the country prior to the match, but the Trojans prevailed despite the fact that they were in enemy territory and were trailing at the half. Winning such contests early in the season can provide a team with tremendous momentum as it enters conference play.
It is also worth noting that the Women of Troy recorded two wins that day, one on the pitch and one on the recruiting front. Morgan Andrews, a midfielder for the Irish that day, has since transferred to USC and figures to be an integral member of the team moving forward. Andrews, who started every game during her two years with Notre Dame, was dominant for the Irish. She had six goals and five assists last season, playing her way to Second Team All-ACC status.
Andrews, a two-time Gatorade National Soccer Player of the Year recipient as a prep star in New Hampshire, is one of three transfers USC has reeled in this offseason. Sydney Myers and Amanda Rooney, formerly of Santa Clara and North Carolina, respectively, will join the Trojans’ midfield along with Andrews. The trio will bolster what was already a strong midfield corps.
As new faces enter the picture, though, some members of the team inevitably fade out of the equation.
Among the departures is standout goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, leaving a void between the pipes. Senior Faith Sugerman, sophomore Julia Murphy and redshirt junior Sammy Jo Prudhomme are all worthy candidates as successor to the goaltending throne.
The team opens play against Texas Tech and Florida State in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Aug. 21. The Seminoles are the top-ranked team in the land after winning the 2014 National Title, but FSU is not the only elite team the Trojans will face before jumping into conference play. The team will also travel to Durham, North Carolina in early September to take on perennial powerhouses Duke and North Carolina.
Though the fans may like to look ahead at the schedule in search of the marquee matchups, the team takes things one game — even one drill — at a time.
“We have a new team motto this year that refers to sticking in the moment and dedicating ourselves to that time,” Levin said. “I think continuing to build on what we’ve learned so far and focusing on the details will help us continue to improve.”

Popular anonymous messaging app Yik Yak has been called many things — chief among them “inflammatory,” “disgusting” and “downright racist.” Certainly, the anonymity of the app has created an odd mixture of humorous-meets-hurtful that can isolate communities, marginalize minorities and enable cyberbullying across campuses. But Yik Yak’s latest update, complete with the addition of photos and a phone number verification system, strips back a layer of the incognito nature of the app in a laudable effort to make it less abhorrent and more newsworthy — and if it works, it could pave the way for the evolution of our interactions with news.
Some have expressed skepticism that Yik Yak will actually be used for serious news. This is, after all, the same social media app that regularly posts gems like “If you think about it poop is just the sparknotes of everything you ate” and “Just realized that beef jerky is cow raisin.”
But consider that few believed that Snapchat could provide an avenue for constant selfie-snapping while simultaneously presenting stories from CNN, the Daily Mail and National Geographic. And few believed that BuzzFeed could offer both clickbait content about the fingernails of Disney princesses and intensely thought-provoking news and opinion articles.
Perhaps Yik Yak, too, will use photos to legitimize a dual use to meld humorous everyday happenings with newsworthy campus issues, such as safety alerts and construction on campus. Given the mission to package social media and news that social networks such as Facebook attempt to create, Yik Yak developers might be thinking along similar lines to create a one-stop shop to combine campus news and life.
A shift to news for Yik Yak would also increase students’ awareness of campus happenings in real time. And due to Yik Yak’s popularity, posts will reach a large audience immediately. When a user posts about a car accident on a local street, a secret concert about to occur or free food at an event (possibly the most important type of news story for the hungry undergraduate), students can actually respond immediately. It’s Twitter, but for college.
The beauty of community-created content is that there’s no guesswork about catering to the college audience; the community gives immediate, and sometimes brutal, feedback. No one cares about that lecture you posted about? You’ll be downvoted to oblivion. Post the menu at Parkside, however, and you may be awarded with a high Yakarma score.
Skeptics point out that Yik Yak’s anonymity — the heart of its ability to cause real harm to students — poses a significant problem in attempting to report news. If Yik Yak became a substantial provider of community-created news, any post could be taken at face value as true. Such a lack of verification does, indeed, hinder the legitimacy of Yik Yak; however, the design of Yik Yak’s rating system allows peers to downvote inaccurate posts and sort out low-rated posts. This requires a community to act collectively to affirm or deny statements, but considering that the campus community is the lifeblood of Yik Yak, such action is not impossible. Millennials may not care as much about the accuracy of information as they do the community aspect of responding to crises in real time; perhaps the trade-off between credibility and immediacy is worth it.
Despite the potentially game-changing effect of Yik Yak’s update, it’s important to consider Yik Yak in context; we should take care that Yik Yak’s new update, at the very least, does not worsen the offense that many associate with the app. Yik Yak’s move to incorporate pictures into posts could have ruined the app (nude photos, anyone?), but by banning pictures with faces of people, Yik Yak provides some sort of protection against cyberbullying. Though such a measure is not foolproof, app developers have realized the effects of their app design on students’ lives.
Maybe Yik Yak will remain an outlet where entitlement and ignorance reign and insensitive comments overshadow positive ones. But maybe, if we are willing, it can change.

USC’s changes to the general education requirements will take effect starting with this year’s incoming freshman class.
These changes will not affect students enrolled in the University before the Fall 2015 semester, or incoming transfer students.
Originally, a request to review and revise  the general education requirements  came from the office of former Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett. Over the course of three years, a number of faculty committees convened to outline a rough proposal for the new model that was then passed, allowing for the process of implementation to begin.
Dr. Richard Fliegel, associate dean for Undergraduate Programs, said, that though the past general education model was good, curriculums are never fully static and updates and revisions are made from time to time.
“It was not a result of dissatisfaction with the previous program,” Fliegel said. “That program was not only considered very successful at USC, but it was lauded by other institutions as well, as a model.”
While slight changes have been made to the categories from the 1996-2014 model, including the addition of quantitative reasoning, the actual course material will remain similar.
The new classes in the “Core Literacies” category will be: “The Arts,” “Humanistic Inquiry,” “Social Analysis,” “Life Sciences,” “Physical Sciences” and “Quantitative Reasoning.”
New students will now be required to take two additional general education classes: “Citizenship in the Global Era” and “Traditions and Historical Foundations.”
The diversity requirement used in the old core curriculum will now be a “Global Perspectives” category. The category’s classes will deal with the same issues and inquiries as the diversity requirement but through a wider scope.
“Traditions and Historical Foundations” will provide foundational context by examining societal development. Working in tandem, “Citizenship in the Global Era” will explore contemporary social, political, economic and cultural issues outside of the United States in an effort to cultivate a coherent understanding of globalization. Both courses do not require taking additional classes. Rather than adding courses to students workloads, GE’s will have designated tags indicating that global perspectives requirements can be met by passing these courses.
Daniel Newman, a freshman majoring in real estate development, said the new update will make students even more well rounded.
“I think it’s really a great thing for all of us students, because it makes us much more well rounded, which I think is very important to being a Trojan,” Newman said. “In general, being a person in this world, you need to be able to speak to many different people about many different things, and I feel like these new GE requirements are one more step towards being the ultimate well-rounded person.”
An exciting attribute of the new model is that students will be able to fulfill some of their general education requirements by taking classes across the university’s professional schools, as well as Dornsife College. This change now provides students with an opportunity to start completing their majors earlier, by enrolling in classes that overlap with their general education requirements.
“The committees, both the design committee and the implementation groups, were very, very committed to the idea that it should not delay graduation, “ Fliegel said. “They also made a very concerted effort to make sure that a larger number of classes could be used to be both general education requirements and major and minor requirements.  That was possible under the old program, too, but the number of courses that did that were many fewer than there are now for the new categories.”
Incoming freshmen are also expected to enroll in a “General Education Seminar” during their first year at the University.
The purpose of the seminar is to ensure that students will have at least two small classes, the other being Writing 150, during their first year.
The seminars most closely resemble the “Arts and Letters” requirement from the old model, but have less than two-thirds the maximum capacity of the former general education catagory’s classes.
Over 100 general seminars will be available, with topics ranging from arts and humanities to life sciences and quantitative reasoning. Some examples from the “Seminar in the Arts” are “Authenticity and Popular Music” and “The Dream in Poetry.”
With the seminars, students can earn credit for any one of the six “Core Literacy” requirements.
Newman added that he is anxious for the change, but he trusts USC’s decision.
“[The update is] kind of scary, but I have my trust in USC,” Newman said. “I know they’ve obviously done a lot of research and preparation to make sure that the change isn’t too drastic and that we’re all ready for this.”

Just keep digging · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio brings veteran experience to the roster as a three-year starter. The Pac-12 All Star looks to add a conference title to her resume. – Brian Ji| Daily Trojan
The USC women’s volleyball team will look to improve from its 16-16 overall record from 2014, one of the program’s more disappointing campaigns in recent history.
In 2015, the Women of Troy were tabbed to finish fifth in the preseason Pac-12 Coaches Poll, though they, along with head coach Mick Haley, will try to prove they are capable of finishing toward the top half of the conference.
The Women of Troy are also one of a conference record nine Pac-12 teams ranked in the AVCA Top 25 Coaches Poll with USC slotted at No. 22
USC will have some big shoes to fill, especially with the departure of first-team All-American and 2013 AVCA National Freshman of the Year Ebony Nwanebu, who opted to transfer closer to home and play for Texas for her final two years.
Experience was something that the Women of Troy lacked last season, as 11 of the 16 players listed on the 2014 roster were underclassmen. In 2015, however, USC has that experience, returning five starters, including senior captain and All-American Samantha Bricio.
The 6-foot-2 outside hitter enters her final year at USC hoping to add a national championship to her already star-studded résumé. The soon to be four-year starter from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, is coming off a 2014 campaign in which she was named to the AVCA All-America 2nd Team, AVCA Pacific South All-Region Team and Pac-12 All-Conference Team. Bricio was the only player who started all 32 matches for USC last season, leading the team with 514 kills and 4.28 kills per set on a .257 hitting percentage, while adding 2.88 digs per set. The senior will look to have an even greater impact during her final season in Trojan uniform.
The only other senior on the squad is 6-foot-4 middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, who earned a Pac-12 All-Conference Honorable Mention nod after averaging 1.60 kills per set and 0.98 blocks per set. Ogoms, always a steady force at the net for USC, set career highs in all statistical categories last season, leading the team in blocks and coming in second on the team in hitting percentage (.363).
The class of 2017 is headlined by a trio of juniors who spent the last season gaining valuable experience playing in expanded roles on the court.
One of those experienced returnees is libero Taylor Whittingham, whose emergence last season from serving sub to defensive stalwart in the back row anchored the Women of Troy’s defense Whittingham, a 5-foot-8 junior from Rancho Santa Margarita, California, had some big shoes to fill after USC’s career digs leader and First-Team All-American Natalie Hagglund graduated in 2013. After playing in all 32 matches last season, Whittingham led both the team and the Pac-12 conference with 4.97 digs per set.
Another player that saw increased playing time last season was 5-foot-10 junior setter Alice Pizzasegola. The Italian import also played in all 32 matches last season and led  USC with 6.13 assists per set.
Perhaps USC’s biggest secret weapon this season comes in the form of 6-foot-3 junior outside hitter Elise Ruddins. A versatile player with a good understanding of the game, Ruddins will look to have a breakout season. Ruddins was rated the No. 2 ranked high school recruit in the nation by PrepVolleyball.com in 2013, but injuries and inconsistent play the last two years have hindered her performance. But the 2014 Pac-12 Academic Honorable Mention honoree did secure the second starting outside hitter position early on last season and started 19 out of 22 matches, averaging 1.83 kills per set which was good enough for fourth on the team. After a healthy offseason and with more confidence under her belt, Ruddins will look to make a big leap in her third year at Troy and solidify her spot in the Trojan rotation.
The Women of Troy will also welcome five highly touted freshmen to USC this fall. The 2015 incoming freshman class was well regarded, with three of the five players in the Top 50 Senior Aces coming out of high school.
Headlining this talented group of freshmen is 6-0 setter Baylee Johnson. The Dayton, Ohio native played for Northern Kentucky Volleyball Club and was the No. 28-ranked Senior Ace by PrepVolleyball.com out of Centerville HS, where she was named to all-league, all-state and all-region teams throughout her prep career. The dynamic setter, who brings a physical presence at the net, enrolled early at USC in early 2015 and has been competing with the Women of Troy throughout spring training.
The highest-ranked recruit of the class is outside hitter Alyse Ford, who came in as the No. 16-ranked prep recruit out of Mater Dei HS in Santa Ana, California where she was named the 2014 CIF Co-Player of the Year.  Ford is a high-flying attacker and could play a significant role in the Trojan lineup this season, whether it be hitting in the front or out of the back row.
Ultimately, with five new freshmen and one transfer, there are many new faces on this revamped Women of Troy squad. But with a breadth of experience in the veteran players and the fresh energy of these newcomers, look for the USC women’s volleyball team to jump back into the national spotlight this fall and make big strides in the 2015 season.
USC will open up the 2015 season by hosting a pair of non-conference tournaments, including the season-opening Women of Troy Baden Invitational Aug. 28-29 at the Galen Center. The Women of Troy will kick off the season in a rematch against North Carolina on Friday, Aug. 28.
The discussion starts with the fact five players have left the team with eligibility left. Besides Ebony W. who was a star, there
was Lauryn Gillis from Indiana a highly recruited freshman from last season. Anne Marie –   Schmidt left after a sophomore year,
Brittany Ambercrombie who had good height was a frosh, and Kelly Wimmer a libero. Something wrong in the program when
players desert the ship along with the fact it was a very mediocre season in 2014. There is a lack of stature on the outside when
your new setter is taller than they are. A real story would be to find out what is happening with all these transfers.

In a much-needed move for institutional acceptance of transgender and gender-fluid individuals, prospective University of California students will have the option to choose among six gender identities when applying for admission. The gender identities include: male, female, trans male, trans female, gender queer/gender non-conforming and different identity. As the UC system transforms the increased public visibility into institutional reform, USC must also follow in its footsteps.
The recent spotlight on transgender issues has led some to believe that media representation translates to real solutions for the transgender community. However, invisibility is not this community’s biggest obstacle: According to a survey conducted by the Center for American Progress, 64 percent of transgender individuals were victims of sexual assault. Delegitimizing gender nonconforming individuals by leaving them out of formal documentation contributes to the stigma of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals that can lead to very real consequences.
The UC system did not solve these problems by introducing more gender identities. But the school system did legitimize the identity of individuals who do not identify with the gender binary, which can be the small part of a greater movement to destigmatize gender nonconformity at an institutional level.
At USC and other universities, students have resisted institutional silence about non-female and non-male identifying individuals by introducing themselves with preferred gender pronouns. This practice allows non-conforming individuals to introduce themselves in new social circles. USC can respond to this sign that students want greater tolerance by allowing more gender identities when applying — a sort of self-identified preferred gender pronoun that enables self-expression.
USC, despite popular opinion, is also familiar with social justice advocacy. The University’s Residential Education program emphasizes inclusion as a core value, stating, “We value the individual differences of members within our community by creating opportunities for members to embrace and understand the complex backgrounds, ideas, experiences and lifestyles of others.” If the administration fully believes in this concept, it should allow gender to be inclusive.
As USC churns out thousands of educated students every year into the workforce after graduation, the University must consider its social responsibility to the greater community. USC has the opportunity to set an example, as the UC system has, of what tolerance looks like. Having pioneered so many other initiatives that lead to social change, USC can be the leader of the movement for greater acceptance of gender nonconforming individuals.
To continue to place students into discretely “male” or “female” boxes demonstrates a university that ignores the diversity of the student population that it fights so hard to recruit and promote. The University has continually evolved to meet the needs of students in many ways, but when it comes to recognizing identities, USC still seems stuck in the past. It’s time to validate the identities of students, and not just because it’s socially expedient to do so.

Cal State Long Beach student Bryant Trinh found himself nearly $3,000 short after his Venmo account was hacked this past June. Trinh is just one of the growing list of Venmo users who have become victim to theft. Venmo, the up-and-coming internet wallet, provides users with a streamlined payment process for transferring money across bank accounts. The application has popularized itself amongst college students and young adults, allowing users to split checks and bills conveniently across smartphone devices. Despite the security concerns that accompany the application, Venmo provides a highly convenient service for college students.
Venmo critics cite its faulty security measures and poor customer service as reasons for not using the social media-oriented financial service. Complex security measures are evidently forgone for the efficient interface and usability of the mobile payment service. Venmo’s lack of immediate and responsive customer service also adds to the unreliability of the application.
Though criticism of Venmo’s security measures are warranted, the issues surrounding the application are not new to the world of financial services. In 2014, Target’s systems were hacked into and millions of gigabytes of personal information and credit card data were stolen in one of the largest hacking scandals of the century. Not long after, high-end department store Neiman Marcus suffered a similar fate, losing the credit card information of more than a million of its customers to hackers. Even the federal government fell victim to the thievery of hackers when confidential information of over 20 million Americans was stolen from a government database.
Security breaches regarding sensitive information are a fault of the victim’s security measures, but the hackers are to blame as well. The high profile cases regarding Target, Neiman Marcus and the U.S. government demonstrate that even the most rigid forms of internet security are unable to stop some hackers. Thus, Venmo is not particularly negligent of the privacy and protection of their users, but simply newer to the game and suffering from issues that even the most established of companies still face.
Criticizing Venmo’s security measures and uninstalling the application might be too rash of a decision for now. Venmo truly is an innovative and convenient way to streamline the payment process between multiple parties with a few admitted flaws in security.
Tricia Xu, a junior majoring in business administration, says that she uses Venmo to split restaurant bills among her and her friends.
“It alleviated the awkward need to remind your friends to pay you back,” said Xu, who is among the growing mass of students at USC who regularly utilize Venmo for similar purposes.
Despite Venmo’s faults, the application is still functional and efficient. Monetary transactions can be made and received at an instant with one’s mobile device. Moreover, Venmo’s transaction system has propelled America even further into becoming a cashless society.
Prior to Venmo, borrowing and transferring cash efficiently was considered a taxing inconvenience in a society in which fewer and fewer people carry physical money. Now, Venmo offers one of the most convenient solutions to the matter and is here to stay. Despite qualms about Venmo security measures, the application is still fairly young and is constantly improving. Update 6.13.0 of Venmo now sends security codes to its users when accounts are signed in to unfamiliar devices, showing that the company is indeed working to enhance its security measures and protect its customers.
Though Venmo users do bear the risk of hacking and thievery, these risks are hardly any different from the risks associated with traditional credit cards. Venmo consistently makes bug fixes and fortifies security measures in order to strengthen its online security. With its constant improvements and the fluidity it offers to the money transferring process, users should continue to enjoy the luxuries of efficiency and convenience provided by the application.
The credit card as a tool of monetary transaction surely created skepticism during its early stages but is now a commonly accepted medium of payment. Much like the credit card, Venmo should  expect to establish itself just as strongly within the wallets of Americans.

After two consecutive finishes at the bottom of the Pac-12, the USC men’s basketball program is expected to improve this year with its young core returning intact. The Trojans are looking to establish a culture under head coach Andy Enfield but have so far failed to put it all together.
The Trojans will be led by junior forward Nikola Jovanovic and junior guard Julian Jacobs, with major contributions from sophomore guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart. The team also expects to see improvements from other players such as forward Malik Martin and guard Malik Marquetti, two sophomores who showed flashes of potential during their freshman seasons but were too inconsistent to keep regular playing time. Redshirt junior forward Darion Clark and redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt provided energy and shooting, respectively, and performed well both off the bench and as starters for the team.
Jacobs emerged as the leader of the group last season as a captain, especially once McLaughlin was lost for the season to injury in February. Jacobs’ vocal leadership will be crucial for the young team moving forward. The team is also hoping that McLaughlin can return and be an explosive point guard for the Trojans. Pairing McLaughlin with Jacobs will give the Trojans a formidable backcourt that can lead the team and take pressure off the other players.
McLaughlin’s return to health will be key for the Trojans. He can perform not just as a point guard who gets his own shot, but also as a player who can create opportunities for others. With McLaughlin as the established point and Jacobs as the leader of the team, the other players can  also fall into more established roles. Stewart can develop into an athletic defensive stopper, Reinhardt into a true scorer, and Jovanovic as the  go-to big.
“I think that along with being great ball players, having high- character guys in a program is just as important, if not more, to attaining success. That’s the direction this program is heading in,” Jacobs said. “This year you’ll see a more experienced team and one that doesn’t lack depth inside. We’re the exact same team as last year, just faster, stronger and can shoot better.”
Along with this returning core, the Trojans will welcome two freshmen who will give the team much needed depth in the front court. Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright, a pair of 6-foot-10 and 6-foot-11 forwards, respectively, will join the team next season. These two four-star players will not only help the Trojans on the court with their talent, but their merit will also help attract other high-profile recruits to a program trying to get back to its winning ways. Neither of these freshmen expects to be a star player right off the bat, however, and the Trojans should not expect to be drastically better right away.
Metu has also put in work outside of USC and recently put on a show at the Drew League. In one particular performance, he scored 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in one of the most impressive performances of the tournament. If Metu can consistently put up solid numbers like this at the collegiate level, he could become a  go-to player for the Trojans and give the guards a weapon to throw the ball to in the middle.
The team is also adding a player to the roster who will not be eligible to play for another year. Ex-Louisville guard Shaqquan Aaron will be transferring to USC this season and will have three years of eligibility remaining after he sits out a season. Aaron was a top 50 recruit coming out of high school but failed to find minutes in the rotation at Louisville.
These additions might not turn around the program right away, but they will help build up the reputation of basketball at USC and bring in other talented players.
The Trojans will look to their most established players to set the tone early on.
“As far as my role, leading is what I’ll have to do best no matter what that entails,” Jacobs said. “This team is hungry from the first man to the last.”
The Trojans should see some improvement next season after another year with the core intact. The team continues to add talent, but it will take a while for a losing program to  attract the type of talent that will allow the team compete with other top schools in the Pac-12. If USC is able to keep its core together for another year and continues to add talent through transfers and recruiting, the Trojans should be able to have something to cheer for in the near future.

At downtown Los Angeles’ Arts District, food is definitely an art form. New restaurants have popped up throughout  the area, each trying to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing cuisine. EdiBOL, which opened over the summer, is one of the newest additions to the Arts District’s wide array of culinary hot spots.
EdiBOL focuses on food served in bowls, from salads (coolBOLs) to rice dishes (hotBOLs) and an assortment of other small dishes (littleBOLs).  The owner, Andrea Uyeda, serves only locally sourced, seasonal ingredients to create the freshest and most flavorful dishes possible. Though the menu has an Asian feel to it, each dish is completely one-of-a-kind and each bite has a flavor of its own.
For any restaurant, location is key to success, and Edibol’s prime spot in One Santa Fe ensures a promising future. The newly built development is comprised of luxury apartments, boutique stores and restaurants that meld together to create a popular place to live or visit that inspires creativity and generates positive thoughts. There are many other establishments opening up this summer in One Santa Fe, including AmazeBowl and Grow, a fresh produce grocery store. The complex is made up of many great elements; red accents on the white buildings give the property a unique edge that intrigues pedestrians and urges them to explore the area. The restaurant is easy to locate, and the site offers free parking, which is incentive enough to explore the area.
EdiBOL’s interior décor captures the essence of the Arts District. The industrial-style restaurant is composed of concrete pillars, visible vents and pipes lining the ceiling, which harmoniously accompany the deep blue color used throughout the eatery. The dark wood found on the back wall and on the counter at the bar gives the restaurant a calm atmosphere. Blue-and-gray marbled tabletops and zigzag patterns found on certain parts of the wall are a reminder of the unique and creative setting. Even the restaurant’s logo, a circle with its name written inside it — “edi” written small and “BOL” written largely underneath it — is a fun play on the fact that the menu consists solely of food served in bowls and encapsulates the creativity of the restaurant as whole.
 
The restaurant’s service matches the cool and relaxed atmosphere that the  decor has created. Waiters are helpful and take the time to explain the menu and help you order as the unusual dish titles are a bit confusing at first glance. The calmness of the waiters has no effect on the speed of service; the food is prepared and delivered as quickly as possible, which is evident in the freshness of the meal.
Just like everything else about the restaurant, the menu is very unique. Each dish is completely different from the next, but they all have an incredible variety of flavors. The restaurant’s creator, Andrea Uyeda, handpicks the ingredients. She chooses only the best fruits and vegetables of the season to maximize the freshness of each dish. There are other interesting components in the dishes as well, from togarashi to rajas. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that many of the ingredients in the dishes are slightly strange; the staff is very helpful in describing flavors and dishes as a whole. They give great ideas of what the dish will taste like, whether it will be spicy or plain and if there are any overwhelming flavors. The most popular dishes on the menu are the BOLicious and the pretzel grilled cheese.
In the honey citrus coolBOL and BOLicious with shrimp, it is clear that a lot of thought goes into the ingredients in each dish. Each component of the two dishes blends together so that every bite is a combination of fresh produce and unique taste, making the entire experience of eating a BOL exciting.
One especially intriguing item on the menu is the poached egg, which is a part of some of the hotBOLs and can be added to any coolBOL. The egg appears to be fried in breadcrumbs, but the crispy brown outside is so much lighter than that found on most fried food items. The egg’s perfectly crisp outside is juxtaposed with the soft and runny inside, making it a very distinctive addition to any dish.
The menu also includes great drinks and desserts, drinkaBOLs and crumBOLs, respectively, and a selection of “little BOLs,” which allow you to mix and match several small dishes for your meal. The menu is relatively reasonable, averaging about $9 for a filling and flavorful bowl.
EdiBOL is an excellent spot for a nice, and not too time consuming, lunch, dinner, weekday breakfast or weekend brunch that will definitely please taste buds and leave customers feeling healthy and happy.

“I, Too, Am USC” Facebook page
In the latest development in the controversy between the College Republicans and the “I, Too, Am USC” social media campaign, the president of the College Republicans, Jacob Ellenhorn, interviewed with The College Fix in June.
The interview closely follows the campaign’s May post, which spotlighted comments made by the College Republicans to criticize “I, Too, Am USC.” In response to the campaign’s creation of a safe space for marginalized communities on campus, these students posted unsolicited, discriminatory remarks as a way to further discredit minority students. In doing so, said members show that they are threatened when people, who are usually excluded and disenfranchised, are given a platform to support and empower one another.
Amid the racist, elitist overtones of the discussion present in both Ellenhorn’s interview and the original comments is a conscious disregard for the prevalence of white privilege and entitlement on campus.
One of the College Republicans members posted a meme stating: “I fight on because I am tired of getting weird looks for saying that I am a Republican and that I love my country.” By drawing a comparison to their own “victimization” as Republicans, many of whom are male and white, these specific members of the College Republicans discount the experiences of minority students.
Claiming to be a minority does not make one a minority — it is not a label to be thrown on for the sake of momentary advantage. Moreover, other comments said that the students featured in the social media campaign “live under ISIS,” and that “USG takes this group very seriously and funds them and their events with our money.” Referring to the USG funds as “their” money is an example of such entitlement; at the same time, their statement also puts minority students in the group of “other.”
These students’ actions provide proof of inherent and deliberate intolerance toward minority students, which, in turn, illustrates the legitimate need for the visibility that “I, Too, Am USC,” provides to minority students and their struggles. Their posts feature people of color, different sexual orientations, gender identities and socioeconomic backgrounds pointing out instances of very real, systemic discrimination.
A meme of a sophomore student quotes him saying, “I fight on because I know that I belong here just as much as any other student, and yet I constantly have to prove it.” A statement like this does not serve to undermine or discredit another campus group. To those who posted on the  College Republicans page: inclusion on a university campus should not be so unsettling.
In an interview with The College Fix following the comments made on the Facebook page, Ellenhorn claimed, “There is all of this talk about creating safe places for people to express themselves, but if you had an opinion different than them you are not allowed.” But having an unpopular opinion does not equate to experiencing social injustice firsthand, and most importantly, the social media campaign is not comprised of a series of opinions but rather experiences. In calling himself and his organization a minority, Ellenhorn is not only contradicting himself and his reductive remarks, but he is also using the label as a “get-out-of-jail-free” card. These members have a critically important role to play in terms of inclusivity. Though they are, in most cases, unable to experience or speak on systemic oppression, it does not exclude them from being an ally to the cause.
There is actually a place for all College Republicans to show solidarity. These students are more than welcome to do what students of color, different sexual orientations, gender identities and socioeconomic backgrounds do in any other campus space — create their own place and include themselves. Yet by denying the marginalization of minorities, they are choosing to contribute to discrimination on campus. This type of ignorance does nothing but reinforce oppressive boundaries and further isolate USC students from one another.
By labeling themselves as a “minority” for the case of argument, the USC College Republicans are appropriating experiences of systemic racism, sexism and classism onto that of their own false struggle. They do so with the use of tongue-in-cheek diction and memes to belittle such appropriation. Instead of apologizing for their racist and uncalled-for statements, these students continue to fight on for discrimination and still have the audacity to cry out for inclusion.
What is the victim class going to do for attention when Obama leaves office?
Do you really know the republican group members personally? Why not just create your own groups like they have?

Failed attempts at policy reform have led America to reach its tipping point. Too many ideas and too little time has caused the American people to solely rely on theory rather than applied practice, and millennials are set up to face the worst set of ramifications.
Last month, the Center for American Progress released a study that found 20 universities to be responsible for the a fifth of all graduate school debt — with USC listed as No. 5, with students having amassed $460 million in graduate student loan debt.
The exorbitant amount of borrowed money has contributed to the question many students, faculty, parents and bystanders have: Is USC irresponsible for steadily increasing tuition, and if so, why? But a deeper understanding of the interplay between federal and privatized loans and university tuition reveal a flawed system of increased demand and disproportionate tuition rates.
For hundreds of years, America has prided itself on the concept of the American Dream. But with constant partisan divide stopping the effective execution of plans, Americans are no longer reaping success after years of hard work and are becoming less incentivized to do more with the American Dream out of reach.
In the midst of the forthcoming presidential election, many candidates have promised policy reform for debt-free college programs by insinuating that Gen Y’ers will no longer be burdened by high college tuition. This is sadly false. In reality, doling out hollow promises for free education without feasible plans and with limited federal funding only allows the cycle of increased student debt to persist. And while this issue continues, millennials are precluded from fully contributing to American markets.
College debt came under fire last year when Andrew Rossi released the documentary Ivory Tower,  explaining the businesslike nature of colleges. Though nothing has changed since, recently released staff reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York can help explain why both colleges and students are so caught up in the never-ending cycle of rising tuition and higher student debt.
Over the past century, USC has steadily raised the cost of both undergraduate and graduate tuition, but much of the rhetoric behind this steady increase has to do with an interlinked relationship between higher tuition costs and increased loan demands.
As explained in the Federal Reserve reports, higher tuition costs increase loan demand, but loan supply also affects tuition costs. This is can be explained through the pass-through effect, in which colleges adjust to the economic circumstance by counteracting increased costs and the increased availability of loans by raising tuition.
“We find that institutions more exposed to changes in the subsidized federal loan program increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes, with a sizable pass-through effect on tuition of about 65 percent,” the June staff report stated.
The more readily available loans are, the more college will cost and the more likely institutions are to increase tuition disproportionately. The report identifies a positive correlation between higher tuition and available student credit. The study finds that though it appears student loans would benefit students, they actually are detrimental because they create a ripple effect in incentivizing colleges to raise tuition repeatedly. The study also explains that Pell Grants specifically seem to have driven tuition higher because Pell Grants don’t require as much payment as other loans.
The rhetoric and analytical data that the staff reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may explain why students at USC and other colleges in the nation are struggling to pay tuition. The system is the law of supply and demand in reverse: Too much access to borrowed money equals higher tuition rates and less student enrollment.
It isn’t really colleges that are responsible or the greater availability of loans. It’s an overall flawed approach to gearing millennials toward better jobs. Colleges and USC should not falter in these failed cycles of increasing student tuition. In an effort to help the millennials and the economy, universities should consider decreasing tuition so students are not trapped in the cycle of borrowed debt.

Rebound · Junior guard Jordan Adams and the Women of Troy look to improve on their early first round exit from the Pac-12 tournament. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
After coming off a .500 season and losing their top three scorers and best two rebounders, it would be easy for the Women of Troy to panic looking toward the future.
The USC women’s basketball team approaches the upcoming season as an opportunity to improve and challenge itself everyday, even months before the season begins.
“Winning is a state of mind. It’s an attitude,”  USC women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke  said. “I think everything that we’re doing now in strength and conditioning is toward that winning.”
Coming off a 15-15 (7-11 Pac-12) campaign one year ago, in which they fell in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament, the Women of Troy look to return to the conference champion form they were in just two years ago and need to rely on a roster with much turnover.
USC lost several players last season, including graduates Alexyz Vaioletama, the team’s leading scorer averaging 12 points per game, and Kaneisha Horn, an All-Pac-12 Defensive honorable mention selection. The team also lost two transfers and four other players who left the team.
“At the end of the day, it takes experience, the veteran players that we still have helping out the freshmen,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It also takes coaches taking our time to teach players lessons that we want them to know.”
Part of the incoming freshman class ready to make the quick transition to collegiate ball is left-handed New Zealand guard Khaedin Taito, who played for her national team at the under-16, -17 and -18 levels.
Taito is one of four incoming foreign recruits, adding to freshman Australian forward Dani MIlisic and freshman guard Candela Abejón from Spain, as well as Harvard transfer graduate student Temi Fagbenle, from London, England.
“Most of the foreign recruits don’t know about Stanford, they don’t care who Cal is, they’re just coming in as a USC Trojan to beat any opponent they’re going to play against,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It doesn’t matter who you’re facing, if you do what you’re supposed to do and stick to the game plan, you can beat anyone on any given day.”
After opening the first half of last season with a 11-5 record, the Women of Troy went on to drop 10 of the last 14, a tally that Cooper-Dyke realizes cannot be repeated.
“We need to be mentally tougher and be able to endure the season, understanding that our season could end in March or it could end in April,” Cooper-Dyke said. “This offseason we worked a lot on mental toughness, on strengthening and, of course, conditioning.”
Though the season is still months out, the third-year coach said the summer sessions are pivotal for her team to work on their cardiovascular training and learning the heart of her system.
“Some of those small things that end up being important, we want to teach those during the summer access period so that we’re not dealing with those during the season,” Cooper-Dyke said. “During the season we can focus on what offense we’re going to run, what defense we want to run, but the concepts they have down and the terminology they have down.“
As for plans to utilize this new and improved conditioning program,Cooper-Dyke emphasized that her team will be more athletic than in the past and can use its training to get up and down the court more often.
“I love the guard style, but you can’t get out and run unless you’re playing great defense,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We need to get back to our roots and cause some turnovers with our defense and that will allow us to get out on our fast breaks.”
Though some people spent their summers relaxing in various vacation spots, Cooper-Dyke racked up the airline miles traveling to over eight different states ranging from Oregon to South Carolina — but not in search of the perfect beach day.
“Between camps and recruiting and really trying to get the right players for our program, I’ve been doing nothing more than working 24 hours a day,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The Women of Troy look to capitalize on their coach’s pursuit as the team’s quest for a second Pac-12 title continues this winter.
Lost a great deal of respect for Coach Cooper after last season. Too many excuses along the way. Her recruiting has become a non factor having to bring in all these foreign players w/o one top local or out of state talent.

Per an agreement made with Fox Sports months ago, USC is in an “exploratory phase” regarding the naming rights of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and other possible affiliated sales.
The stadium has avoided corporate sponsorship for nearly a century, and the idea of a name change has drawn media attention. Despite recent speculation, however, concerns about a “Pepsi Memorial Coliseum” or a “MasterCard Memorial Coliseum” may be premature. Sponsorship options that do not necessarily involve the Coliseum’s naming rights are also on the table, such as the sale of the university-owned 110 freeway sign, particular event sponsorships, field opportunities and the sale of other affiliated resources. The outcome depends largely on the best package procured by Fox Sports. Currently, a change in naming rights could earn USC an estimated $3 million to $7 million per year.
Because the University has a $70 million obligation to make improvements to the stadium, all revenue from a resulting sponsorship will be put back into the upkeep and maintenance of the facility.
Joe Furin, Coliseum general manager, said the University is still exploring which direction to take the necessary renovation and that all current plans are only tentative and closed to the public.
Furin insisted that no matter the outcome of a resource sale, “Memorial Coliseum” would remain part of the stadium’s name. The Coliseum’s memorial designation was assigned when it opened in 1923 to honor WWI veterans and was later broadened to include all veterans.
The Coliseum’s history also contains such worldwide events as the 1932 Olympic games, an event that according to Furin “put the city on the map.”
As L.A. grew, the stadium attracted teams like the Dodgers and the Rams. There is currently discussion surrounding the possibility for the stadium to host an NFL football team, as part of USC’s initiative to revitalize the Coliseum and potentially finance renovations as well.

As California trudges through its most painful drought in history, many residents of the state have shown reluctance in contributing to the water conservation effort. These individuals have resisted in favor of continuing to water their lawns and maintain picturesque yards. And though it is important to understand that simply taking shorter showers will not solve the problem, the consequences for water overconsumption are graver than ever. Water wasters are taxed for their behaviors not only via mandated fines, but also by unfair pressure from social media.
In droughts of the past, a subconscious awareness of saving water would be enough. But this time, Californians now have bigger problems to face: The state is running out of water, and it’s running out fast. In fact, according to Jay Famiglietti, a senior water scientist whose research was featured in a viral Newsweek article, California only has a year’s worth of water left — meaning we need to find a feasible solution now. Casual household solutions, like shorter showers, unfortunately, are too insignificant to be frontrunners in the race to find fixes to the problem.
Today, environmental activists have found a new platform to express their disapproval: Twitter. With its versatile hashtag, Twitter proves itself the perfect medium to draw attention to a problem of this nature. Not only can users upload pictures, but they can also voice their own opinions in short, 140-character blurbs. And this is exactly what the people have done as their part in solving California’s drought.
The concept of #droughtshaming first took the state by storm in May of this year and has proven to be an extremely popular method to embarrass neighbors, celebrities, local authorities and institutions for their extravagant water consumption. Users often upload pictures of wasteful water situations, caption them with locations of these crimes and tag it accordingly before posting their tweets for the world to see.
This trend does not actually serve any good to the community at large. Once the picture is posted, viewers can only get a good laugh out of the situation. There is no follow-up action after the fact, nor is there any sort of real activism associated with this hashtag. Furthermore, the most common targets of the trend are celebrities or authorities, individuals who have little chance of actually being shamed into water conservation, even if they see their own properties being attacked in the trend. As a social justice platform, Twitter falls short in this instance.
The hashtag has also backfired in the state, drawing attention to the class struggle in certain metropolitan areas. As a side effect of this blame game, income disparities have become more conspicuous. Earlier this year, Gov. Jerry Brown made drastic moves to reduce statewide water consumption by 25 percent of the 2013 statistics, with fines for those who exceeded the limits. In the city of Los Angeles, these fines have made all the difference, visibly. Lower-income neighborhoods who do not wish to pay larger bills let their yards brown, while notoriously high-income neighborhoods continue watering their lawns to maintain the picturesque look of their property. The hashtag only serves as a harsh reminder of the division in the area, rather than creating unity to boost water conservation efforts.
While notable communities such as Beverly Hills have started to crack down on their residents for excessive water consumption, the progress is too slow to warrant the continuation of the #droughtshaming fad. Fines might be a good idea, but if we want any serious results out of Southern California, the region needs more action.
Perhaps the next logical step is in the hands of the local city councils — punishments beyond the water company fines. Cutting off water to certain wasteful areas or households, however harsh it might sound, may be what it will take to reduce our water footprint.

Trojans may have just had 14 weeks off from school, but in that time USC has hardly been sitting idle.
While students were taking the opportunity to work, intern or just catch up on some sleep, the University has opened a new school, reached more than $4.5 billion in its $6 billion fundraising campaign, continued work on a multitude of construction projects and founded a controversially established Alzheimer’s center.
Last year was no different. In the inaugural issue of Fall 2014, the Daily Trojan featured the changes that had been made that summer — the building of the Wallis Annenberg Hall, destruction of the former University Village and USC’s gradual transition from party school to elite university.
There’s a reason “Conquest” is one of the Spirit of Troy’s most famous songs. On the field and off, USC is always looking to dominate and won’t stop until it’s one of the premiere academic and research institutes in the country. In this welcome issue, we highlight both the good and the bad of USC’s quest. The Rossier School of Education is helping to improve the education of local children through a new charter school, and a new dance program will broaden USC’s education in the arts. But at the same time, USC’s ambition to lead in the biological sciences have led to accusations of academic poaching, and the Roski School of Art and Design’s new direction has left some students out in the cold.
As the University is changing, the Daily Trojan is aiming to evolve along with it. More complicated stories and a more diverse student body have necessitated more sophisticated methods of reporting.
Because of this, we are continually seeking to improve our online presence. This semester, our multimedia will no longer be confined to the occasional video or podcast. Accompanying stories online will be media-rich, interactive elements including maps, timelines, infographics and videos. If you’re reading this in print, I encourage you to go online and see how much deeper the stories can get with the added benefit of technology.
Just as the depth of our online content will be extended, so will its breadth. In addition to the print stories that appear online, we will cover unique web stories and add four new blogs to our existing five. In continuing our focus on blogs that began last semester, we aim to go past informing students and welcome them to a community with opinions on fashion, food, music and more.
Regardless of technological advances, the Daily Trojan remains committed to the integrity of reporting that has been at its foundation for its 100-plus year history. In a return to tradition, we have formed a nine-member Editorial Board that will weigh in on one issue of importance to our campus and community each week —  our first editorial appears in this issue. The Daily Trojan has a voice, and with it comes a responsibility to help ensure a well-informed student body.
But though we aim to continually evolve, one thing will remain constant: The Daily Trojan’s primary goal will always be to serve readers to the best of our abilities.

Design by Mollie Berg.
As thousands of USC students learned last month when they opened their USC e-bill, tuition increased by $951 for the Fall 2015 semester. The latest in a trend that has persisted for the last 10 years, USC’s tuition hikes put the University’s lack of transparency concerning tuition expenditures under the microscope as students pay more without learning why.
It appears the University expects students to trust that increases in tuition are necessary to maintain its quality of education. But national research points to the arbitrary nature of increases in private research university tuition. According to the Bowen effect, established by economist Howard Bowen, universities increase tuition not because they are forced to do so, but rather because they have the ability to do so without affecting the number of students attending. Colleges exploit the extraordinary demand for higher education by raising the price of attendance at a rate exceeding that of inflation.
Assuming USC follows this model, its tuition increases benefit the University at the expense of students. The tuition hikes take advantage of the near necessity of a college education in today’s professional landscape while demonstrating an unacceptable lack of appreciation for students’ circumstances. USC already charges one of the highest tuition rates in the United States, and as a nonprofit organization committed to its students, it should be mindful of their diverse financial backgrounds.
It’s possible USC doesn’t follow this model. However, it’s impossible to know as students have no clear resource to find out how their tuition dollars are being spent. Given already high and annually increasing rates, it is irresponsible for the University not to be transparent about its spending.
Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, if USC had been increasing tuition solely for inflation since 1995 — the earliest year for which tuition data is available from USC — fall tuition should have increased from $9,123 in 1995 to $14,285 in 2015. At $24,732 for the Fall 2015 semester, USC has more than $10,000 to explain in extra cost of attendance.
USC’s method of informing students of tuition hikes — a higher number on the semester bill — also demonstrates that the University is out of touch with students’ needs. This lack of communication between students and the University is apparent in the prominent “Subject to Change Without Notice” disclaimer displayed on the USC Schedule of Classes “Tuition and Fees” page.
If USC is increasing tuition exclusively to pay for the rising cost of education, there should be standard procedures to inform students well in advance of how much tuition will increase and the reasons for the increase. Some families, especially those who may be struggling to pay already, might be put over the edge by this sort of tuition hike. Regardless of whether USC has raised tuition arbitrarily, tuition hikes still contribute to an environment in which a better standard of education is based on the income of one’s parents. USC’s efforts to attract the most talented students via high school programs, grants and scholarships will be ineffective if the baseline tuition is so high that many students cannot afford it.
In a time when income inequality and student loans are major talking points for presidential candidates and education leaders alike, creating a system in which students from more affluent backgrounds have an advantage is unethical. Tuition hikes blatantly ignore the needs of what the University refers to as its primary responsibility in its mission statement: the students.
If the University wants to stay true to its mission, it must do two things: First, only raise tuition when it serves a concrete purpose that will benefit each individual student. Second, proactively communicate to students a breakdown of how their money is being spent. Indeed, if USC is genuinely using this extra money for necessary student costs, there is no reason for the University not to be transparent.

After a summer filled with laughs (Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck), tears (Inside Out), screams of terror (Jurassic World) and flops (Terminator Genisys), this fall’s new releases are about to hit the screen. Though films with darker content are typically released in the fall, there are also several new films that will provide some great laughs. Here is an introduction to the top 10 most promising films for the fall.
1. Black Mass (Sept. 18)
Johnny Depp, who is either a master of disguise or equipped with an excellent make-up team, is riveting yet terrifying in the released previews for Black Mass. Depp portrays real-life American gangster Whitey Bulger, who became an FBI informant working out of South Boston. With strong supporting casting — Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson and Kevin Bacon — this rattling film is sure to be a dramatic shift from Depp’s recent trend of box office and critical misses.
2. Everest (Sept. 18)
Based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, which killed eight climbers and left several others stranded, this dramatic film promises plot twists and a big climax. The main focus of the film will be the survival attempts of the two exhibition groups who climbed the mountain during those fateful days, one led by Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhall) and the other led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke).
3. The Intern (Sept. 25)
After playing stunning characters in the woeful world of Les Misérables and the not so hopeful future of Interstellar, Anne Hathaway steps into a more uplifting setting. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers, this charming, comedic film stars Hathaway, Nat Wolff, Adam DeVine and Robert De Niro. Jules Ostin, portrayed by Hathaway, is the founder and CEO of a fashion e-commerce company: a little neurotic, incredibly stressed and overworked. Though the woman struggling to juggle it all is a cliché seen many times on screen, the film looks to be made a little more interesting with the addition of Ben Whittaker, played by De Niro, a senior who will intern at Ostin’s youthful firm through a community outreach program. Throughout the film, it is Whittaker who will help Ostin open herself up to the world.
4. Steve Jobs (Oct. 9)
Due to overwhelmingly negative reviews of Jobs, the 2013 biopic featuring Ashton Kutcher, from viewers and former Apple employees, it was a surprise that a new cinematic attempt at piecing together the complicated life of Apple’s cofounder followed so soon. For the majority of 2014, the bulk of press about the upcoming second-attempt biopic were the changes in directors and cast. This was coupled with a major studio change, from Sony to Universal Pictures. Out of all that drama comes a picture directed by Danny Boyle and starring Michael Fassbender. This new biopic, in which audiences can catch a glimpse of Job’s overly analytical yet incredibly fascinating personality, appears much more promising than the 2013 version.
5. Goosebumps (Oct. 16)
After a long struggle to get it done, the Goosebumps movie is finally here, in what is clearly going to be the Halloween movie of the year. Early previews have shown that viewers should be prepared for lots of laughs, as Jack Black takes on the leading role as Goosebumps author R.L. Stine. Additionally, many adventures show Black and the children of the film, portrayed by Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush, chasing down the ghosts and monsters who have accidentally been released from the books and are wreaking havoc all over town.
6. The Peanuts Movie (Nov. 6)
To commemorate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip, a live action version is making its way to the big screen. The whole gang joins Charlie Brown as he tries to gather the courage to finally make a move on the Little Red-Haired Girl. This film looks to have no shortage of laughs as early previews of the film show Charlie trying as hard as he can to change for his object of affection, with hilariously disastrous results.
7. By the Sea (Nov. 13)
Subtract the mass shootouts against enemy firms and assassination attempts, yet keep the plot about a couple trying to keep their waning marriage alive, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith becomes the idyllic By the Sea. The film marks power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie-Pitt’s reunion on the big screen. Though both Pitts produced the film, Jolie-Pitt also wrote and directed it. By the Sea hasn’t had a huge marketing campaign — some film stills have been released, but the majority of excitement has been raised by speculation from the fans. While Jolie-Pitt’s directorial skills received mixed reviews from Unbroken, By the Sea seems incredibly promising in its romantic plotline and choice of actors. Since on-screen chemistry was undeniable in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, there’s a chance this feat by the same actors can achieve the same appeal.
8. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 (Nov. 20)
In the much-anticipated last installment of the Hunger Games film series, Katniss and crew are ready to obliterate President Snow and end the Games. The frenzy from fans about the final film has reached skyrocketing heights, but the main concern is whether the last installment will justify the hype. The decision to split the third book into two films has been mixed, with some critics claiming it unnecessary, especially since Mockingjay: Part 1 received average reviews and seemed to fall short of expectations.
9. Victor Frankenstein (Nov. 25)
After nearly two years of production and release delays, the Frankenstein movie has arrived. James McAvoy stars as the titular character, a young medical student, while Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor, who has been known as Victor’s assistant from previous Frankenstein horror films. The 2015 film is told from Igor’s perspective, and though no previews have been released thus far, expect a dark and profound performance from Radcliffe.
10. The Good Dinosaur (Nov. 25)
With smash hit Inside Out dominating the box office, Pixar is looking to continue the magic by doing something they have never done before — release two films in one year. Created by those who worked on Finding Nemo and Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur tells the tale of Arlo, a young Apatosaurus becomes lost after using his father, and on his way home befriends a Tarzan-esque little boy who he names Spot. The film looks very endearing with quintessential Pixar tearjerker moments. As Pixar has been relying on an overabundant amount of sequels for the past couple of years, The Good Dinosaur promises to take audiences on an original adventure.

Though down one top ten NFL draft pick from 2014, the rejuvenated USC football team adds a new wave of talent to pack a punch on the defensive line this season. With the departure of newly minted New York Jet Leonard Williams, several players will vie to take up the mantle at defensive end and join redshirt seniors Antwaun Woods and Delvon Simmons on the frontline in 2015 — among them, five-star recruit Rasheem Green and redshirt senior Claude Pelon.
Woods and Simmons are set to return as the primary rushers up the middle in defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s 3-4 scheme. In 2014, Woods tallied 37 total tackles during the regular season at nose tackle, while Simmons brought the ball carrier down a total of 44 times last year. Despite the loss of their All-Pac-12 teammate, head coach Steve Sarkisian firmly believes that Woods and Simmons can lead the charge of the Trojan defense.
“We lost a generational player in Leonard, but we are thankful that this year’s defensive line has a nice mix of veterans and talented young players,” Sarkisian said.
After playing backup to Woods and Simmons for all of the 2014 season, during which he recorded 19 tackles, Pelon will attempt to shift from defensive tackle to defensive end in order to fill the void left by Williams. Though he has yet to see any in-game snaps at defensive end in his career, Pelon believes the transition will be seamless.
Like Pelon, Green will also rotate between defensive tackle and defensive end this upcoming season. Green enters the USC football program a highly touted newcomer from Gardena, California powerhouse Junipero Serra High School. After collecting 46 tackles during his senior year, half of which were for losses, Rivals.com ranked Green fourth in the country among strongside defensive linemen for the class of 2015. Now, Green will aim to seize the opportunity and garner playing time from Sarkisian right out of the gate.
“There is lots of senior leadership, while at the same time the new players will be hungry to push for playing time,” Sarkisian said.
As a true freshmen joining the Trojans, the difference in the football team’s depth from previous years will be particularly noticeable on the defensive line. Whereas Williams played what Sarkisian called an “astronomical” number of snaps while USC faced NCAA scholarship sanctions, the second-year head coach will be able to look beyond Woods, Simmons and Pelon to the likes of Green and freshmen Noah Jefferson and Christian Rector. Sarkisian believes the veterans and newcomers alike will be able to hold their own.
“This [recruiting] class, I think, in the end, is going to win a lot of football games for us,” Sarkisian said. “How much they contribute as true freshmen as compared to when they contribute as maybe a junior or senior, I think that remains to be seen quite honestly.”
With a beefed up front line, Sarkisian, Wilcox and the Trojans will hope to improve from 46th overall in points allowed en route to national contention. The reloaded defensive line will look to bring the heat to Arkansas State on Sept. 5.

The Pac-12 Championship Game. That’s my expectation for this upcoming season. Not a national championship or one of the four national playoff spots, or even winning the Pac-12 Championship. Just getting to the conference title game. That should be the barometer for a successful season in the Coliseum.
That’s not saying that a Pac-12 title or a top four finish is out of reach — they are very real possibilities. But USC can fall short of that and still have a successful season in my book.
The goal has to be progress for the Trojans, and the next step for USC is winning the Pac-12 South.
It wouldn’t be the first Pac-12 South Championship for USC. The Trojans actually finished atop the division standings in 2011, the inaugural season of the expanded conference. But that was while USC was still ineligible for postseason play.
The Trojans have to play great to come out on top. Arizona, UCLA and Arizona State all made the Preseason USA Today  Coaches Poll along with the Trojans, and Utah being ranked at No. 30, so the conference slate will be a slugfest — heck, Colorado is even projected to be halfway decent!
Great doesn’t necessarily mean flawless, though.
Additionally, USC will have to face both of the North division heavyweights with Oregon making the cross-division schedule for the first time since 2012. Throw in a Notre Dame team that Sports Illustrated has ranked as high as fourth in the country and USC probably has the toughest potential path to the playoff out of the conference.
These six heavy hitters are split evenly between home and away games.
The Stanford matchup in particular worries me. USC’s past two victories over the Cardinal might indicate that the power balance in California has shifted back to the South, but both of those wins were pretty unlikely — certainly the upset at the Coliseum two years ago but even last year’s win at Stanford that featured a pair of Cardinal missed field goals and lost fumbles. Stanford is certainly coming off a down year, finishing 8-5 after making BCS Bowl appearances each of the previous four seasons. According to SB Nation’s advanced stat on projected wins, Stanford should have finished last year with 1.4 more wins than it did based off of its total statistical output, indicating that last year’s dip was more of an aberration. I expect Stanford to see big improvements this year, and that should be a tough test early at home. The other matchup that worries me is Arizona. USC defenses have historically had problems with mobile quarterbacks, from Vince Young at the 2006 Rose Bowl to Brett Hundley the last three seasons. The Wildcats’ Anu Solomon looks to be the most likely version of last year’s Tyler Murphy of Boston College.
Unlike Stanford, SB Nation’s adjusted win projection said Arizona should have finished with 2.5 fewer wins than it did last year in its unlikely run to the division title, and the Wildcats will probably regress back toward the mean this year. But like Stanford, Arizona was a late missed field goal away from beating ’SC last year.
Maybe this is just a gut feeling, but I think USC will get up for Oregon and Notre Dame. The Oregon matchup is hard to gauge because it’s been so long since USC has been up there. But if that’s the only time USC goes into a game ranked slightly lower than an opponent, it will probably give the Trojans a mental edge. The Notre Dame game should be much closer than last year’s 49-14 win, but I think that goes to show that the Fighting Irish aren’t on USC’s level.
Arizona State is due for a whooping. No mercy spared after last year.
And of course, the most important of them all. Coach Steve Sarkisian proved that he took back L.A. this past spring by landing the best recruiting class in the nation and nabbing all the best talent Southern California had to offer. It’s time for that to bear fruit on the field. The three-year losing streak to UCLA is almost unthinkable, and for any class of USC football players to graduate without a victory over the archrival is blasphemous. The Trojans have honestly been on the same level with UCLA these past three years, so the Bruins are due for a regression head-to-head, and the loss of the aforementioned Trojan killer Hundley will totally change the dynamic of the game. USC will beat UCLA this season.
There isn’t a game on paper — maybe with the exception of Oregon — that the Trojans shouldn’t win. But looking at the season as a whole, something will probably go wrong, and all of those tests won’t add up to a perfect season.
So that’s why I’m going with an 11-3 prediction. 10-2 in the regular season, winning the Pac-12 South, beating Oregon once but not twice, then capping off the season with a New Year’s Six bowl victory.
Coming off a good but not great 9-4 campaign last season, a No. 1 ranked recruiting class according many media polls and with Sarkisian’s first year now behind him, the pressure will certainly increase for him to bring home a national championship.
But it’s important to remember that this is still a rebuilding program. This is a team that hasn’t legitimately been on that level since 2008, and last year’s class was the first full recruiting class USC has taken since the three-season NCAA imposed recruiting caps.
That’s why the goal has to be progress. Sarkisian by no means should be on the hot seat if the team falls a touchdown short of the conference title or the College Football Playoff. But if the Trojans put up another 9-4 season and play second fiddle in the South to UCLA, then that becomes a real concern going forward.
The key is remembering that a national championship isn’t the only thing to be proud of as a sports fan.
Of course, it’s much easier for me to say this as a junior rather than a senior, but I really think the 2016 season will be USC’s best chance at a national title. The Trojans just aren’t there yet.
But I wouldn’t mind being wrong.

On a late afternoon in July, the Roski Master of Fine Arts class of 2015 gathered inside the graduate student fine arts building that had been their studio, their classroom and their meeting place for two years. Paint covered the walls and each had his or her own studio once filled with everything from paint to black lights, woodwork and sculptures. But now, two days before the students were to vacate the space permanently, many of the studios were empty and locked, with remnants of unfinished projects scattered in the hallway.
What was left of this once-robust artist workspace, the students said, is a metaphor for a master’s program that began to crumble around them. It’s for that reason that one July afternoon, they authored a petition and letter to President C.L. Max Nikias, Provost Michael Quick and Trustee Edward Roski calling for the resignation of Erica Muhl, dean of the Roski School of Art and Design.
“The program that we had signed on for and the program that was internationally renowned for nearly a decade no longer exists as we leave here,” said 2015 M.F.A. graduate Alli Miller.
Muhl became dean of the Roski School in 2013 and, according to students, her leadership has taken the M.F.A. program on a downward trajectory.
The 2016 Roski class made headlines in May when all seven members resigned from the program because of “the University’s unethical treatment of students,” specifically regarding changes made to the curriculum and receiving of teacher assistantships.
In a statement released that same month addressing the withdrawal of the class of 2015 Muhl said:  “I regret that several of our M.F.A. students have stated they will leave the program over issues that were presented to us and that we considered to have been resolved.”
Muhl declined to be interviewed for this story.
In their petition, the class of 2015 expresses solidarity with its first year cohorts and echoes its frustration with the Roski administration. The students said the petition also mirrors the concerns expressed in a letter of support for the 2016 students authored by the USC M.F.A. Alumni, 2005-2014.
In May, all but one member of the 2015 graduating class boycotted commencement.
“This is the only thing we can do, but it was a last resort,” said 2015 M.F.A. graduate Veli-Matti Hoikka. “Our point is partially as the graduating class to echo the complaint of the dropped out class and convince the public at large that [the class of 2016] was   not incorrect or misled, and the experience we had was similarly flawed.”
The petition has garnered more than 800 signatures including John Gordon, former dean of the Roski School from 1981-1987, and many prominent members of the art community, including MOCA Curator Bennett Simpson, artist Martha Rosler and artist and UCLA photography professor and USC graduate Catherine Opie.
Quick responded to the class of 2015’s letter, thanking the students for voicing their concern and stating the narrative of the class of 2016 was portrayed inaccurately.
“No curriculum changes were made after the students arrived at USC, and the only change made, months earlier, was a course substitution in the summer schedule,” Quick said in the letter. “I’m afraid that the [students in the class of 2016] were given very bad advice. We all hope that they will decide to rejoin the school in the future.”

The First Signs of Trouble
The class of 2015 said the troubles began long before these two actions were ever made public.
In August 2014 the students submitted proposals for summer travel, but by the end of the fall semester the Roski administration was silent about the trip they funded in previous years. From there, students said, the cracks in the program only deepened.
In December 2014, core faculty member Frances Stark left the program, and shortly thereafter, A.L. Steiner stepped down as program director. It wasn’t until January, when both the 2015 and 2016 studio art MFA students met with Muhl for the first time, that they were told there was no funding for them to travel this summer.
Meanwhile, the students said curricular changes continued to take place without consultation with any of the core faculty members. The class of 2015 said they were required to take two new classes that were master’s of arts classes — which did not include a studio component — rather than the fine arts classes they expected.
While their first year cohort was fighting to get teaching assistantships, the class of 2015 was struggling with the assistantships they had been given; oftentimes they were placed in critical studies classes rather than the studio art classes better suited to their skill set. M.F.A. student Sofía Londoño said she TA’d the same class three times.
Meanwhile, faculty continued to leave. In February, Dwayne Moser, the program coordinator, resigned. By the start of the summer semester, all the core faculty with whom the students had worked closely had departed and summer classes were being taught by adjuncts.
Questions About the Future
The class of 2015 said they are concerned about the future of the studio art M.F.A. program, particularly given the school’s recent emphasis on technological integration.
Muhl, who served for 23 years as tenured faculty in the Thornton School before her appointment as Dean of the Roski School, now concurrently works as director of the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy. The program launched in Fall 2014, and integrates studies in art, design and computer science, as well as business and venture management.
There is only one student enrolled in the M.F.A. studio art program next year, and she is coming to USC as part of the International Artist fellowship. Miller said the student, HaeAhn Kwon, is from Seoul, South Korea, and studied alongside Miller as an undergraduate at Cooper Union. Though some members of the class of 2015 have spoken with Kwon, they say she appears reluctant to make judgments about the program until she arrives.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in June, Muhl said the school had suspended recruitment efforts for the time being.
As their tumultuous second year at USC comes to a close, students are also concerned for their future and the potential devaluing of an M.F.A. degree from USC.
“When I started, this program was robust,” Hoikka said. “I didn’t expect it to break down as I was pedaling for more speed, and I feel angry that I lost a lot of momentum because this fell apart.”

Easy ’SC Cruisin’ · USC students can now easily open the new Campus Cruiser app on any Apple or Android device to catch a ride back home. The new application aims to cut down on wait times. – Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
USC Transportation’s Campus Cruiser program has launched a phone application and website this past July that allows Trojans to request a Cruiser from their laptops and mobile devices, replacing the previous system in which students had to call for a ride.
Tony Mazza, Transportation director, said the new resources will improve the Campus Cruiser experience.
“The goal for implementing this system is to continue to find opportunities to improve the program, and this system will better align our program with the technology available today,” Mazza said. “It makes sense to have a smartphone app where you can request calls.”
Amri Rigby, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, said the app makes it more simple to request a ride.
“The Campus Cruiser app is very convenient and makes setting up rides much easier than before,” Rigby said.
The app, downloadable on both Android and iOS platforms, allows users to not only request a Cruiser, but also see who is driving it, when it will be arriving, where it is and what vehicle will be used so that your Cruiser can be easily identified. In addition to the app, a website was also created to give Trojans another platform to request a ride. At the end of the ride, users can provide feedback about their Cruiser experience.
The new website and app aims to be  convenient and eliminate communication errors that have resulted in incorrect pick-ups or  directions. Users can input their pick-up location and arrival destination in the app to avoid these mistakes.
Kathrina Ruiz, a sophomore majoring in political science, said the app saves time.
“I love the app because I don’t have to wait through long lines on the phone just to put a request in for a Cruiser,” Ruiz said. “It’s also great because I can see when the Cruiser is arriving and the route.”
Mazza emphasized that the ability for users to input the description of their location will reduce missed pickups and gain efficiencies in the dispatching operation.  Furthermore, the system has the ability to indicate descriptions of pick-up locations, which will tell you where you should wait if you are at a particular building.
After putting significant time and research into creating an app to serve users, USC Transportation chose safe ride program RideCell to handle requests for Cruisers. RideCell also provides software for safe ride programs at other universities and uses a model that is similar to popular app-based ridesharing services Uber and Lyft. Like Uber and Lyft, the Campus Cruiser app allows users to rate their ride and track it in real-time.
Before the app, students were able to track their Cruiser’s arrival through SMS text message updates and through an online call tracking platform, TransNET. It was useful for some students; however, if a Cruiser were to arrive earlier than the quoted time, there was no way to notify students besides the notification at arrival. This created confusion and led drivers to wait around, wasting valuable time to start new journeys during high-demand times.
This app and website project is one of the many recent improvements that USC Transportation has been making to the Campus Cruiser program. Over the course of the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters, Campus Cruiser extended their service boundaries, increased the number of employees and vehicles, and partnered with Uber to eliminate wait times on busy weekend nights. The app is one of the next big steps for Campus Cruiser’s initiative to meet demands for the future.  It will really be put to the test this coming fall semester.
“Ultimately, the goal of our program is to provide safe and efficient transportation to our students, and we will continue to research opportunities that will help us achieve that goal,” Mazza said.

For thousands of school children (and some college students), the first day of school means one stressful decision: a first-day-of-school outfit. 
At the Daily Trojan this year, we had to make similar decisions, only our style wasn’t fashion — it was grammar. 
Every publication has a “style” — the way it writes certain words and phrases, or if it writes them at all. Most supplement individual “style rules” with what has become the style bible: the AP Style Guide. Though whether to say “e-mail” or “email” may sound trivial, having a pre-determined style ensures that a publication stays consistent, has a distinct voice and avoids confusing readers.
Though there are some completely arbitrary ones, the vast majority of style rules have a logic inherent in them. For the uninitiated, whether a publication uses an Oxford comma (the first rule of journalistic style: don’t) — or even what an Oxford comma is — is completely irrelevant. But for a journalist who is trying to tell a story in most concise way possible, there is absolutely no reason for extra symbols that disrupt the text. 
As the times change, so does what can be considered good grammar taste. There’s a reason AP releases a new guide each year. To keep up with these changes, this semester we’re committed to developing a new Style Guide for the Daily Trojan, rules chosen both in light of tradition of what the paper has previously done and editors’ own personal preferences. And I can assure you that for every style rule the Daily Trojan has, thought has been put into exactly why we want to do it that way.
To create this guide we’ve had to do three things: write down traditional rules the paper has always followed and we’d like to maintain, solidify new rules that we’ve never had a policy on and change some of our old policies as we welcome in a new era.
Creating the beginnings of this style guide meant a lot of arguments over grammar between the managing editors and me, and also made us realize just how much we all love the minutiae of writing. And since we all have such strong opinions, what better way to express it than through our own grammar blog?
Just don’t get us started on Trojan F/family.

Welcome to the Daily Trojan’s new and improved blog section! Last semester, we rolled out a new website that allowed us to launch six blogs aimed to build our online presence. Over the summer, we’ve made a few changes that we hope will enhance this section and appeal to a variety of interests that span across campus. We’re excited to introduce four new blogs — Behind the Desk, SC Style, Commas Saves Lives and Trojan Tunes — in addition to continuing DeeTs, Troy Meets World, DT Photo Blog, Trojan Timeout and SCrumptious. 
As the University’s independent student newspaper, it’s imperative to us that we are completely transparent with our readers. We spend a lot of time in the newsroom — you can find us on fourth floor of the Student Union after 5 p.m. every weekday — so we wanted to give you an inside look at what we do here with a new weekly blog, Behind the Desk. We hope that it will provide a sense of transparency by offering editors a forum to share what’s most important to them and their section, as well as give the opportunity to explain editorial decisions they have made. 
For all you fashion lovers out there, SC Style will highlight the newest trends from Fashion Week runways to USC’s campus. With Trojan Tunes, commentary on the latest albums and the perfect playlists will be posted. Comma Saves Lives invites readers into the exciting world of copy editing where the grammar police of the newsroom engage in heated debates over the use of commas versus semicolons. 
This semester, we will build upon our existing blogs by expanding our presence on campus and beyond. The main blog, DeeTs, will feature everything from top ten study location on campus lists to anecdotes offering a glimpse into the everyday lives of SC students. We also hope to incorporate more multimedia, such as polls and quizzes, to make the blog more interactive. 
Troy Meets World will bring readers adventurous tales of fellow Trojans studying around the globe. Every week, snapshots following a certain theme will be posted, sent by students based in cities from London to Rio de Janeiro. The DT Photo Blog will continue to capture images of campus life, complete with the week’s greatest events in photos. Trojan Timeout will give a rundown of drama from the sports arena, from campus competitions to international games. Last but not least, readers can head over to SCrumptious for a taste of SC with student-friendly recipes and local restaurant and cafe reviews. 
We hope that these Daily Trojan blogs will continue to serve as a forum for students to express themselves, keep up with student life and enjoy creative pieces by fellow Trojans here on campus and around the globe.  
Sincerely,
Emily Goldberg and Valerie Yu
Fall ’15 Blog Editors of the Daily Trojan

All of the hustle and bustle of move-­in week got you looking for an easy way to unwind and refresh? All settled into your dorm or apartment but not yet willing to settle for the dining halls? Try these light and easy recipes that you can whip up without the need for any electric kitchen appliances.
Breakfast/snack: Fresh fruit and yogurt
Stop by Fresh & Easy, or if your parents are still around, have them drive you to Ralph’s to stock up on some fresh fruits and yogurt (also any items that are a bit heavier to lug to your dorm like a pack of water or pop).
Opt for either a large container of yogurt—I like plain and vanilla greek yogurt—or individual containers of yogurt you can toss after eating (if you don’t have bowls or don’t want to have bowls to wash).
Rinse and cut larger pieces of fruit like strawberries and toss them into your bowl or cup of yogurt. Feel free to add some nuts for added protein or honey for added sweetness. Pair with coffee for a morning energy boost.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Lunch: Salad
Salads can be light, refreshing, customizable and perfect for a hot and busy day in L.A. In a bowl, toss together washed lettuce (you can grab a bag of chopped lettuce or spinach at Fresh & Easy) and any veggies or additions you like. As a fan of the BLT, I threw together a lettuce, tomato, avocado, bacon and chicken salad. If you don’t have a stove to cook chicken or bacon, you can sub for other sources of protein or buy precooked chicken. And if you’re really craving bacon (because who doesn’t love bacon?), then toss a few slices into your microwave to cook.
Sometimes, I like to add in nuts, cheese or even fruit. If you’ve got some leftover strawberries, tossing together spinach, strawberries, walnuts, feta and/or figs with a light vinaigrette makes for a great light salad as well.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Beverage: Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade 
Mixing a bit of strawberry lemonade with sparkling water (I use the Fresh & Easy version of both) with strawberries or lemons is a great way to cool off and indulge in a quick and delicious beverage.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
And for dinner…
Head to the dining halls! If you’re new to campus or back for another year, make a stop at Parkside, Cafe 84 or EVK to check out what’s available, meet other new students or catch up with your friends on their summer adventures!
Keep checking SCrumptious this semester for awesome recipes, ideas, nearby restaurant reviews and food tips to get you through a tasty new semester!

Arranging a lineup and planning an outfit go hand in hand for music festival attendees. Let’s not pretend that Coachella’s music festival is the only display of popular street fashion. Located in the heart of Los Angeles, the FYF Festival is sure to be a hub of the latest fashion trends.
If you are feeling pressure about fitting in at FYF, don’t. Let me tell you what you can expect. Around every corner, someone will be dressed in overalls. These people will hold up the bathroom lines because, let’s face it, overalls are impractical for quick stops, but, hey, they’re hip.
Next, there’s the pineapple print. The pineapple has been around for centuries but this summer, it has a lot of popularity. No one is quite sure why, but pineapples are all the rage.
Sunglasses will be crucial because FYF takes place in the daytime. May I suggest any rounded frame glasses? The John Lennon-look for sunglasses is taking festivals around the country by storm. Keep your makeup light—you will probably sweat it off, but try out a dramatic lip. On the scale from natural to Kylie Jenner, you want to fall right on Rhianna.
Some accessories have run their course in festival fashion. Flash tattoos were once a commodity, but now they sit at the bottom of our drawers, reminders of how we spent ten dollars on one sticker. Another overplayed accessory: the sun hat. They were popular at one point in time, but they block 95 percent of your vision, so leave them at home. Oh, I almost forgot—please no flower crowns! I know it can be tempting to throw them on top of your head on your way out the door but they are a dead giveaway that you’re a festival newb.
If you’re still freaking out over FYF fashion, calm down. Part of fitting in with fashion is standing out. Don’t have overalls, pineapple print, or John Lennon shades on hand? Check the outfits below for inspiration!

When I think back to my first days as a USC student, there are songs that I instantly associate with the unique feelings of being a nervous and wide-eyed freshman. To this day, when I listen to these songs I’m instantly overwhelmed with the same emotions I felt back then when I was trying to get settled into a new environment.
Many students have songs that they associate with their first days as an official Trojan. They may have been songs your friend showed you right before you left for school, or maybe they were the songs that you listened to when you were homesick because you’ve known all the words since you were a kid. For me, there’s a love-hate relationship with the songs that bring back the memories of being a new freshman on campus. I’m sure many students can remember how stressful, albeit eventful that had been.
Some of the songs on my freshman year playlist were oldies but goodies, some were new at the time, some were already slightly outdated, but I played them all over and over again during my first few days at USC. To most people, these songs would have no clear theme or connection because where else would you hear Migos played right after a Billie Holiday track. Or some Tim McGraw followed by Slim Shady? To me, however, these songs represented all the emotions I experienced those first few days. A lot of it had to do with me being homesick for the first week or so, and these songs reminded me of home.
I hope every student will be able to look back on the songs that made them feel like they did when they were new to USC. These songs are a couple of tunes that I’ve been listening to lately, as I’m getting ready to go back to school. In May, I’ll be able to listen to this playlist and remember exactly how I felt at the beginning of the fall semester. Like last year, these songs include a wide variety of genres and styles, but they represent how I feel going into sophomore year. This playlist should provide a good point to find songs that will help you remember this crucial time in every student’s life.
Songs:
CHA CHA – D.R.A.M.
Panic Cord – G Frsh (Prod. By HUCCI)
Dontcha – The Internet
Talladega – Eric Church
Crash My Party – Luke Bryan
Apartment – Young the Giant
Mean Streets – Tennis
The Golden State – City and Colour

Maintaining a healthy weight, managing money, and keeping track of to-do lists while juggling academics and extracurriculars is something that many college students struggle with. These five innovative apps alleviate some of those responsibilities from students.
1. Evernote: The perfect place to jot down lecture notes or simply passing thoughts, Evernote is an application that will help keep life organized. In addition to its text note and photo note functionalities, Evernote offers many features and provides a solid solution to list keeping on the go. Evernote also sports a scanning feature that imports handwritten notes and paper documents at a high contrast to ensure maximum readability. Additionally, Moleskine and Evernote have partnered on a product line for individuals who still prefer traditional pen and paper note taking. These Evernote notebooks by Moleskine are entirely compatible with the Evernote app and are considered the first smart-notebooks of their kind. Syncing across nearly all platforms and devices, Evernote is perfect for the student wanting to travel light without sacrificing the option of studying at anytime, anywhere.
2. Acorns: Financial stability is a key component to a stress-free life. Beginning to invest at a young age can pay dividends in the long run, and Acorns is the application for that. Targeting millennials who are looking to put their money to work, Acorns rounds up spare change and invests it in portfolios of users’ choosing. For example, if coffee was purchased for $2.35, Acorns would round up to $3.00 and invest $0.65 in the stock market on the user’s behalf in a fund of his or her choosing. It doesn’t seem like much, but spare change adds up over time, particularly when it could be accruing interest. Acorns offers five portfolios, all with varying levels of risk, managed by Nobel Prize-winning economist, Harry Markowitz. Acorns is already flourishing among millennial investors as it allows individuals under 24 to trade without fees and commissions. Beginner investors should not be turned away either as Acorns makes it incredibly easy. Seasoned investors will find Acorns’ appeal as well. This is the app for the money-savvy student.
3. Google Drive: Google Drive is more than just a platform for group PowerPoints and last-minute lab reports. Compatible with almost any file type, it’s one of the best cloud storage services currently available. USC students are given 10 terabytes of Google Drive cloud storage by the University with their email address. That amount of storage is more than even most computer science majors know what to do with, so taking advantage of the perks is encouraged. There is no better pocket companion for making some last-minute edits or working on the go than through the Google Drive app.
4. Clear: The daily grind can become pretty hectic, and Clear is an excellent app for keeping you organized, setting important reminders and keeping lists to remain on task. Clear is unique in that created items can be sorted by priority, whether they are reminders to head down to Leavey Library for study sessions or to purchase supplies on a list at the bookstore. It is an app that will noticeably increase productivity and can be tailored to meet the level of structure all users appreciate in their own life. With an intuitive user interface and a minimal design worthy of a Tumblr blog, Clear will definitely appeal to many students.
5. Lose It!: The concept of the “freshman fifteen” is daunting for most incoming students, so for those concerned about future health habits, look to the app Lose It! This app helps users maintain a healthy lifestyle by making it incredibly easy to keep a log of both diet and exercise. When logging food consumption, users can select from a pre-existing catalog of food items or opt to create their own unique food items. To make it even easier, Lose It! also sports the ability to scan bar codes if users wish to be very particular about logging their diet. Lose It! calculates a daily calorie goal for each user depending on height, weight, daily exercise and weight goals. With this information, a healthy dietary plan with a completion date is created for the user. This app is also great for simply maintaining a healthy weight. Healthy living is for everyone, especially new college students, and Lose It! is well worth the download.
A good one, Grant!
A very useful set of apps.  Great suggestions!  I also like Wunderlist for task management.

Hands on at Hybrid High · A charter school student learns through experimentation during her class at the school’s downtown L.A. campus. – Photo courtesy of Chris Shinn
The Rossier School of Education plans to open its second charter school, USC East College Prep, this month. The school will serve students in the Lincoln Heights area, where USC’s Health Science Campus is located.
USC East College Prep is the successor to USC Hybrid High, Rossier’s charter school in downtown Los Angeles. This fall, USC Hybrid High will serve 450 students, grades 9-12, introducing its first senior class.
Ednovate, a charter management organization, operates both schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Karen Gallagher, dean of Rossier, said that the charter schools strive to enhance urban education.
“Our mission is to improve learning in urban education, locally, nationally and globally,” Gallagher said. “We felt that this was an opportunity to bring in kids . . . starting in the 9th grade [and] give them high quality teachers, college prep curriculum and . . . individualized learning.”
According to Gallagher, 80 percent of the students attending USC Hybrid High are eligible for free and reduced lunch. Demographically, Gallagher said about 60 percent of the first charter school is Latino and 35 percent is African American, with about 30 percent English language learners.
Gallagher said the charter schools are creating a positive multigenerational change. The aim is to influence students to think ahead about how they will use their careers so they can comfortably support themselves and their potential families.
“Not only will [the students] improve and have a better life . . . but their children and their grandchildren will benefit,” Gallagher said.
Ednovate CEO Oliver Sicat said the charter schools follow their own curriculum, which gives them the opportunity to be more innovative.
“We get to be more innovative because we can take more risks,” Sicat said. “We don’t have to use the district’s curriculum. We take very calculated risks that get to pay off, but we have a lot more flexibility and autonomy in how we prepare our students for college.”
In addition to a need for improved education, L.A. families’ high demand for more schooling options catalyzed the foundation of  the new charter schools. Before the location was set for USC East College Prep, 250 families had showed interest in attending, according to Gallagher.
USC East College Prep is aiming for 140 students in its inaugural 9th grade class, Gallagher said.
The new school will follow the instructional model, continue to integrate technology in the classroom and promote individualized learning.
District 1 Councilmember Gilbert Cedillo said the charter schools are not only helping individual students, but also whole communities.
“I’d like to commend USC for helping improve the communities of the First Council District,” Cedillo said in a statement released by USC News. “Some of the communities in my district have been challenged with access to college, either because no one in their family has ever attended college or because they frankly don’t see it as an option. With the establishment of this new school, I hope the pipeline to college will be established for residents in the surrounding communities, creating more access and opportunities for our bright students.”
USC East College Prep will not be the last USC charter school.
“We have plans to open up three more [schools],” Gallagher said. “We hope to open up each year after this next school.”
Sicat said that having more schools means more growth for the schools.
“When you have more teachers trying to attack the same problem . . . we’ll learn faster or innovate faster,” Sicat said.
The USC charter schools help the Rossier School of Education students learn as well.
“We’re studying these [schools] to see not only what we can help the schools to do better, but also how we can do a better job preparing teachers or principals and so on, so it’s a really great relationship,” Gallagher said.

Last month, federal judges in Virginia voted to uphold a Confederate flag ban on new Virginia license plates —  the latest in a series of actions taken by southern states to decide whether to fly the Confederate flag. Indeed, the national debate over the Confederate flag that followed in wake of the June 17 Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting has stirred controversy and discussions about the symbol that shooter Dylann Roof appeared to hold so dear.
The Confederate flag, like many symbols, means wildly different things to different people based on their cultural upbringing. It can represent pride, conviction, equality and unity. It can also represent intolerance, hatred, discrimination and separatism.
A person’s individual interpretation of what it stands for is rooted in his or her cultural and social experience, education and resulting understanding of the symbol. But perhaps bringing the issue closer to home — to campus, even — will show us that symbols are owned by those who claim allegiance.
Negative perceptions that result from symbols are valid, especially within the context of the Confederate flag. But that perception must be tempered with rationality. When people are offended, they have two choices: They can feel upset and decide that they are being attacked individually, or they can question why they feel offended and the motivations behind the perceived offense and begin a dialogue. Let’s begin that dialogue here.
Take the Bruin, for example. To many loyal Trojans, the Bruin represents something that must be vanquished again each November — the enemy. There is a tradition of rivalry, a long-standing dislike of the Bruin for being blue while we are cardinal, for being public while we are private, for being awful at sports while we have 135 Olympic Gold medals.
This tradition exists because it is expected to continue and is actively promoted. We have our differences, but these should be celebrated, not criticized, on both ends of the aisle. What matters is the good that both universities do for their students, the city of Los Angeles, the United States and the world. As long as both universities are promoting higher education and making leaders and entrepreneurs out of young adults, they are performing their roles admirably. If we are so similar, then why do we insist on annually attempting to cause thousands of dollars of damage to their sacred icon, their symbol of self?
If we were to distance ourselves from the social pressure to personify them as “the other,” we’d find that they are as easy to befriend, get to know and engage with as any other Trojan. So let’s not tarnish the Bruin, either. Respect the Bruin as we want Tommy Trojan to be respected.
It is easy to classify a group uniformly as “the other,” especially for both social justice advocates and traditionalists. It is also wrong. It leads to the negative things that some symbols come to represent – intolerance, hatred, discrimination and separatism. We must remember that Americans who live in the South are still Americans. They are our fellows and equals even if they hold opinions and perceptions that clash with our own.
The Confederate flag is often viewed as both a symbol of hate and a celebration of slavery by those who do not identify with it. However, to many individuals who live in the South, the flag isn’t a symbol of slavery or hatred, it’s a symbol of pride. To many of them, it is the flag of their ancestors, a flag that has a prominent spot in their history and identity.
While the Confederate flag and the conflict over slavery and states’ rights does not equate to the rivalry between two neighboring universities, each group has its own very different interpretation of what the symbol means.
It should be the group that identifies most with the symbol that determine its meaning. We wouldn’t want Bruins telling us what to do with Tommy and Traveler or outlining what they really represent. Those icons are ours, and it is our right to revere them, display them and declare what they mean to us as a part of our heritage.
That being said, there should be dialogue between social justice advocates and traditionalists that uncovers the reason behind the drastically different views of the same image. After all, if one simply categorizes another as the enemy, there isn’t much reason to get to know them. That trend of categorization, which lends itself to the cycle of hate, can only be vanquished through acceptance of and engagement with “the other” as “the equal.”

The University of California, San Diego sued USC over research data and grants after former UCSD professor and researcher Paul Aisen left San Diego to work at Southern California. On July 24, San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith Hayes ruled in favor of UCSD, giving the school control over a project on Alzheimer’s disease.
At UCSD, Aisen led the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study, funded by the National Institute on Aging. The research centered around a clinical trial that determines whether a drug developed by the pharmaceutical corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, can prevent or slow Alzheimer’s by blocking a protein buildup in the brain.
UCSD claims that USC, Aisen and eight colleagues worked together to take data gathered on more than 1,000 patients, as well as an estimated $100 million in funding, to a new USC Alzheimer’s study center.
In speaking of his decision to move, Aisen told the Los Angeles Times that financial problems at UCSD impeded the expansion of his research. He said USC is more flexible and allows him to “optimize” his work.
Research universities commonly recruit faculty from other schools. Consequently, the losing school also has to forfeit the overhead funding that the researcher’s grant was paying his or her institution. When investigative teams leave for new universities, if they take their grants with them, the new university typically receives those funds that cover research facilities and administrative support.
In early August after the court ruling, Eli Lilly and Company decided to shift their funding from UCSD to USC.
According to Provost Michael Quick, the research, not research grant politics, must come first.
“Dr. Aisen is very concerned that if UCSD has sole control over [the data], there might be patient safety and data safety issues,” Quick said.
Aisen and his team want to be in charge of managing the data, regardless of which university’s patronage they work under.
In early July, USC requested in a Superior Court in San Diego that UCSD be blocked from access to the study’s data. The judge denied the request.
USC maintains that collaborative research is the ultimate goal. Therefore, President C. L. Max Nikias is still continuing to try and better the school’s reputation in biomedical sciences, from upgrading infrastructure to recruiting top-notch faculty.
According to Quick, the highest priority should be preserving Alzheimer’s patients’ hope for the research going forward. For this reason, Quick is concerned about research getting sidetracked by the trial.
“[The lawsuit] has the potential of causing distress for all the patients on these clinical trials,” Quick said.
NIH officials would not comment on the litigation, but NIA spokesperson Barbara Cire said, “We do want to assure participants, the ADC’s network of sites and the research community that we are aware of the situation and are working to ensure that operations continue, with a focus on participant safety and data integrity and utility,” Cire said.
Researchers switching schools — and taking grants with them — is common. Quick said UCSD’s reaction, therefore, came as a surprise.
“The lawsuit is a really blunt instrument for dealing with this,” Quick said. “In academia, we tend to want to solve things without having to go that route, and I’m still hopeful we can work this out.”
The lawsuit is filed because USC was trying to lock UCSD and everyone else out of the data through a series of dirty tricks around an Amazon Cloud account. How low and controversial can USC get and who are they expecting to fool?

Swimming in success · Sophomore goalie McQuin Baron and the Trojans look to avenge last season’s championship loss to the rival Bruins. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Though the men’s water polo team might have had a vacation from classes, they’ve had a busy summer both in the pool and in the news.
USA Today recently rated USC the top university for men’s water polo. This honor was bestowed on the university based on both its athletic prowess as well as its academic reputation.
USC has won a total of nine national championships with an unmatched six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
Last year, the Trojans fell just short in an upset by crosstown rival UCLA in the championship game. The team complemented their deep playoff run with a successful regular season in which they finished with an overall record of 24-7.
Over the past two seasons, the Trojans have combined for an impressive record of 52-11 as well as the 2014 national championship.
A main reason for USC’s dominant history is head coach Jovan Vavic. Vavic has served as both the men’s and women’s coach for the past 20 years at USC and has seen tremendous success in his time as part of the Trojan Family.
Vavic has a win percentage of .868, which equals an outstanding record of 448-68. The impressive streak of championships that only recently came to an end with a second place finish, the Trojans extended their streak of nearly 10 season in which the team has not finished lower than second in the country, dating back to 2005.
As a team included in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, Vavic has a record of 311-66, a win percentage of .825 against Federation teams since 1995. Outside of the MPSF, Vavic has recorded only two losses in his 19-year career.
Not only has Vavic seen success coaching each of the men’s and women’s teams, he has also won both championships in the same year four times,  most recently in the 2012-13 season.
His 13 national championships make Vavic the coach with the most national championships of any coach in USC’s decorated athletic history. Vavic has also been named coach of the year 12 times nationally and 10 times by the MPSF.
Vavic’s success has rubbed off on his players as well. Ten of his players have won the Cutino Award, the most prestigious award in water polo.
In the pool, the Trojans have been just as successful this summer.
In July, recent graduate Nikola Vavic and current goalie McQuin Baron helped the U.S. Men’s team secure their place in the 2016 Rio Olympics with a semifinal win over Canada in the Pan American Games. Team USA went on to win the championship with a win over future host Brazil in the final.
The men’s water polo team will return to the pool this fall in hopes of bringing back another national title to USC.

It takes a village · The USC Village, slated to open in fall 2017, has made much progress since the spring semester ended. The new Village is just one of the many building projects USC is currently working on. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
With the start of a new school year just around the corner, returning students might be able to spot several new additions made to the campus since they last saw it. This past summer, the USC’s construction on a number of its capital projects has continued to progress on schedule.
The Kaufman School of Dance will be welcoming its first B.F.A. class this fall, and progress on the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, located along West Jefferson Boulevard, has proceeded on schedule to be completed by Fall 2016. In the meantime, the incoming students will utilize temporary dance studios being prepared in both the Physical Education Building and the Hancock Auditorium and Museum. Even though construction on these studios began just a few months ago, they will be ready just in time for the fall semester.
This past October saw the start of a new project on Downey Way and McClintock Avenue: the Michelson Center for Convergent Biosciences. This new building is expected to be completed in two years and will serve as a new space for research. The facilities will be available to students within both the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Viterbi School of Engineering to encourage collaboration in biological sciences and biomedical engineering.
Similarly, the Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall, located at the corner where Exposition Boulevard and Figueroa Street meet, will be completed in May 2016. As a result of the Fertitta’s generous donation to the Campaign for USC, this five-story building will provide the Marshall School of Business with a total of 1,046 more classroom seats, as well as 50 breakout rooms.
Another capital project supported through the Campaign is USC’s highly anticipated Village. According to Craig Keys, associate senior vice president for civic engagement, construction is on schedule with 25 percent of the project complete and will be ready in Fall 2017. In just two years, 1.2 million square feet of retail shops, classroom space, dining and student housing, along with two levels of subterranean parking, will stand tall on Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard. While this project will surely have a lasting effect on USC’s students and the city once it is completed, it has already begun to affect the community by creating 4,000 construction-related jobs.
To accommodate for the expanding campus, construction on the Shrine parking structure will begin this upcoming fall and is expected to be ready for use in Fall 2016. Located on West Jefferson Boulevard, this project will provide the University Park Campus with 1,300 more parking spaces that can be used conveniently for events at the Shrine Auditorium, athletic events and the new residence halls at the Village. Moreover, it will expand availability for short-term parking as well as long-term permit parking.
In preparation for the new academic year that will begin on Aug. 24, Leavey Library, located on West 35th Street, underwent renovations this past summer, which included fresh paint on the second floor as well as the stairwell for all floors. Additionally, the second floor will be showcasing newly-installed carpets, upgraded computers and two new study rooms.
As a few long-awaited buildings near the end of their preparation, new construction projects are being planned at the same time.

With a new academic year ahead of them, President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler shared their upcoming plans and goals for the Undergraduate Student Government with the Daily Trojan. These include, among other things, addressing students’ mental health concerns, the rising costs of college tuition and USG’s accessibility.
Sampath — the co-chair for a national mental health working group with the National Campus Leadership Council, a nonprofit which connects student body presidents with each other — said the team plans to explore  possible strategies to combat student mental health issues.
“Mental health matters because we go to a beautiful university where students seem like they have perfect lives, but beneath the exterior, there’s a lot of internal issues everyone grapples with,” Sampath said. “We have to end the stigma on mental health, and we plan to devote this year to doing so. Our USG Academic Culture Assembly and Wellness Affairs committee will run mental health campaigns, programs and advocate for improved resources on campus for all students to benefit from.”
Alongside mental health, the other two major issues both Sampath and Fowler plan to tackle are sexual assault and college affordability.
“Mental health, sexual assault and college affordability are three big areas [where] we are going to focus our advocacy efforts,” Fowler said. “We have already begun setting up meetings, working on programming and researching these issues more so that, come fall, we have great momentum to really create real results.”
Sampath added her thoughts on the rising costs of college tuition, which she claims could affect current and future Trojans.
“I’m particularly excited about college affordability and taking a look at the rising cost of tuition at USC because it’s a problem which will affect current and future generations of Trojans — especially ones who come from lower or middle-class families and are doing everything in their power to continue attending USC,” Sampath said.
Other upcoming USG projects are the creation of a textbook advisory committee, a student events security fee, a relocation for the disability services office, gender neutral bathrooms, increased funding for recreational sports and a shuttle to LAX during holiday breaks.
Sampath said that a key method in making these changes is to look at the solutions other universities have implemented.
“I always keep my eyes and ears open for news stories,” Sampath said. “I love researching what other universities do in order for us to improve our own campus. I’m constantly scouring the internet or newspapers to see what Stanford, Georgetown, Yale or other campuses are up to.”
This summer, Sampath and Fowler traveled to Washington, D.C., for the NCLC Presidential Leadership Summit, where they met other student leaders and shared ideas for campus policy.
“Many students at other universities experience similar situations and, as a result of that conference, we have a network of people who are also passionate about creating the best university experience for students,” Fowler said. “We are already sharing presentations, proposals and guides and using each other as springboards to universally activate change.”
Sampath said that USC’s national presence this summer should not be the exception, but the rule.
“USC’s student government hasn’t exactly played this role at a national level before. We want this to be the standard from here on out,” Sampath said. “This is one of the reasons why we are hosting the PAC-12 Leadership Summit this fall, which will host the student government leaders of PAC-12 schools. We want to bring the minds devoted to improving student life together to learn from each other.”
Overall, Sampath and Fowler emphasized the accessible nature of their student government.
“I don’t want to prioritize one group of students over another group of students or some needs over other students’ needs,” Fowler said. “Every student on campus is different, and there are enough of us in USG to be able to delegate roles and get everybody’s voice on campus heard.”
Sampath voiced her advocacy for those oftentimes overlooked by USG.
“I said this in my inauguration speech, but I really do care about the invisible Trojan,” Sampath said. “There are students on campus who don’t feel like they are heard or don’t feel like USC cares about their voice, and we want to speak up for them. We need to make them visible.”
“We have to end the stigma on mental health”, they said, loudly
proclaiming it!
(Sadly, they did not listen to their own voices.)

Late last month, social media platform Yik Yak announced its intent to start including pictures along with posts. Yik Yak, an anonymous bulletin board, has invited controversy since its inception due to many reports of cyberbullying and offensive language. Though the public should allow time for the company to shed its negative image and adopt an inclusive identity, this new feature fails to move Yik Yak forward and ultimately creates a more derisive environment.
Unlike its counterpart, Whisper, which allows users to post completely anonymously from anywhere in the world, Yik Yak provides a more personal atmosphere due to posts that can only be viewed within a 1.5-mile radius. Because of this, the app is popular in communities, especially college campuses, with users validating each post with an up or down vote. According to CEO Tyler Droll, it is the college students who often engage in discussion and debate over campus topics that have requested the addition of photos along with their “yaks.”
The reality is, prior to the addition of images on Yik Yak, reports of dangerous users had already put the company under scrutiny. In October 2014, police officers arrested a user for threatening to “kill everyone in Penn State Main.” University of Michigan discovered in April that a Yik Yak user in its community posted an apparent suicide note. Not to mention, at Utica College, an army of people spewed directed slurs at the campus’ transgender population. These are some of the many incidents which have propelled the public to believe that the mere existence of Yik Yak is highly detrimental to the student population.
The addition of pictures on Yik Yak fights fire with fire. Granted, posting each photo comes with many Yik Yak-imposed safeguards. For instance, any picture containing a face or signs of nudity will be immediately revoked. These restrictions are seemingly put in place to ensure the safety of Yik Yak users; however, they also silently confirm the existence and inevitability of malicious content. Obviously, setting the availability of each board to such a narrow proximity increases the likelihood of targeted posts. And now, internet bullies are equipped with two different kinds of weapons: text and images.
Perhaps the biggest contributor to Yik Yak’s nastiness is in the very fabric of the app’s construction. Anonymity will always give endless power to cruelly mock and make threats. As psychiatrist Dr. Keith Ablow put it, “Psychologically, Yik Yak actually removes all pretense of being a person with empathy, genuinely connected to other human beings.” No amount of innovation, especially not the addition of photos, will steer Yik Yak toward a path of humanity.
Even at its very best, Yik Yak is still irresponsible. Users commenting on their mundane lives are part of a faceless mob, ready to attack by force of voting or posting.
To educate this crowd, Yik Yak’s endeavors should include teaching its users the effects of each publication, no matter how mundane. In contrast, the photo feature does nothing to strengthen Yik Yak’s moral compass. Once an image is posted to cyberspace, the poster has no idea about how his or her picture has traveled.
That being said, Yik Yak aims to foster patches of communities, and its growth thus far on college campuses seems to be an indomitable force — the app is found on more than 1,500 campuses. Communities, however, are made up of people who deserve the respect of one another. Yik Yak’s injustices cannot simply be eradicated by the new picture feature, and by not teaching users the responsibility of mindful language, Yik Yak fails to progress. New strategy, please.

One of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s most ambitious goals is to get Los Angeles out of the housing crisis.
That’s why standing in front of Circa, a $500 million dollar luxury complex whose grandeur prompts comparisons to Times Square, the mayor celebrated a cultural renaissance in the city last month as well as an economic revitalization of downtown Los Angeles. However, just a few days later, he was silent about nearby Skid Row activists protesting both delays in the construction of affordable housing projects as well as the recent passage of city ordinances 56.11 and 63.44, which criminalize homeless encampments in the area.
Garcetti’s silence on city ordinances 56.11 and 63.44 reinforces accusations of Los Angeles’ history of housing discrimination; the bills grant legal authority for the seizure of homeless encampments and codify a “cleansing” of public areas at the expense of local residents. Violators are given 24 hours to remove all belongings from public sidewalks before their houses can be legally dismantled and their possessions destroyed. Without the means to pay fines and purchase housing, an entire community’s history and way of life have become illegal under city law.
For a mayor who promised to build 100,000 new houses by 2021, this criminalization of homelessness underscores the city’s hostility to impoverished residents. A lack of compassionate policy solutions to the housing crunch sweeps away poor, primarily black and Latino residents’ property in the name of “economic revitalization.”
The mayor is right about the need for housing solutions. Los Angeles is known for problems with housing equality, from its vacancy rate, which is lower than New York City’s, to its stunted housing permits per capita, which is lower than San Francisco’s. The majority of the city’s homeless remain primarily black and Latino, and minority families with discounted housing vouchers face traditional hostility in newer, suburban neighborhoods. The city’s notoriously brutal treatment of Skid Row residents and anemic municipal support for subsidized housing only worsen the rent/wage discrepancy and hike up the city’s historically high poverty rates. The establishment of 650 luxury condominiums, however, is an inappropriate response to housing inequities, and Garcetti’s lack of constructive dialogue only makes the city’s horrendous history of housing abuse all the more apparent.
Harassment of the homeless downtown takes after a history of housing discrimination in the city. A 1968 epidemic of overt refusals of home sales and bank loans to black home buyers prompted the Fair Housing reforms in 1968, and almost two decades later, police crackdowns on Skid Row destroyed entire communities and left them without support or housing solutions.
But even the fatal March shooting of a black homeless Skid Row resident raised questions over the brutal Los Angeles Police Department tactics in the area; while Los Angeles has taken large strides from the overt discrimination from the 1940s, the city’s languid response to homelessness and police brutality mark a tradition of neglect. The municipal government’s obsession with “cleaning the streets” and victimizing the homeless creates violent living conditions for those already struggling to survive.
Today, the homeless spike in Los Angeles presents uncomfortable discussions about race and class amid the city’s remarkable economic and cultural growth. While construction cranes and new businesses dot the skylines of Century City, Santa Monica and downtown L.A., homeless shelters and housing projects support less than a third of the city’s homeless population. The mayor’s race for a new, cleaner town prompts questions over what his cleansing entails; Garcetti’s lack of response to police crackdowns on people’s homes and pandering to luxury business development hints at a vision for the city which excludes the needs of the minority groups who require it most.
Los Angeles’ homeless need homes, not forced relocation policies that pressure them to leave. Affordable housing models have already been proven in large metropolitan areas to provide the poor with shelter and reduce stress on social services, but over 50 percent of Los Angeles’ homeless budget ends up in the hands of the police.
Utah’s Housing First program, which provided thousands of homeless residents with homes, saved tens of thousands of dollars in social services all while treating people with basic respect. Los Angeles may be a completely different beast, but it certainly needs more humane solutions to poverty than current policies. As it increases its rapid pace of Downtown development, the city must not lose sight of a population struggling to find their own home.
At USC, students take classes two metro stops away from one of the largest homeless populations in the United States. On a closed campus at one of America’s finest research institutions, it is easy to forget the privilege of living in a house, much less finding a home.
Especially in a city enjoying a massive surge in urban development, students must look beyond “economic revitalization” rhetoric and search for the families and the faces impacted by Los Angeles’ race towards urbanization. Organizations for housing sustainability in immigrant and low-income neighborhoods are fighting to preserve a way of life in a city already difficult to live in. Finding solutions to an unsustainable housing system may be a requisite first step toward building the city as a home for everyone.

Clean and simple · Minimalist tactics include of getting rid of anything deemed unnecessary, including extravagant decoration. – Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
A new school year often brings a new place of residence. No matter if the move is to a dorm room, apartment or house, it is the perfect opportunity to get rid of clutter that has been piling up for years. The recent trend in organization has had hoarders everywhere questioning whether they really need that ceramic elephant collecting dust on the bookshelf or the bathing suit that hasn’t been worn in 10 years. Whether the student is a freshman or an upperclassman, college is undoubtedly one of the most crucial times to employ a minimalist attitude.
1. Don’t need it? Don’t keep it. First, question the need for all belongings. This goes for clothes, decorations, furniture and so on. If the items are used all the time, then they, of course, should be kept. If not, out they go.
The trick with this is to be as brutal as possible. The hardest is eliminating sentimental stuff. If something has a specific memory attached to it, hold on to the positive thoughts while disposing of the object. Memories and relationships are not tied to material goods, but it is hard to realize that until unnecessary things are purged. Ultimately, fewer possessions will help clear mental space.
2. Think about the psychology. Psychologists have studied the effects of minimalism on everyday life. It is theorized that a desire to hoard is something that has been passed down through evolution. Animals that hoarded food may at one time have had a survival advantage. By collecting more food than necessary, those animals could ensure they would have enough to sustain them in the long run. This tactic to hoard to survive, however, clearly is not necessary anymore. Now, scientists suggest that our desire to hold onto little and meaningless items may even be a symptom of anxiety, distress and loss.
Psychologist Jim Stone wrote in Psychology Today that “Perhaps minimalism isn’t about minimizing the amount of stuff we own. Maybe at its core it’s more about maximizing the amount of time, attention and energy we have available for the most important things in our lives.” Minimalism is a positive means of reducing dependence on material possessions and focusing energies on relationships with others. This will funnel into trying exciting new things and not feeling tied down.
3. Tidy Up. Another way to practice minimalism is to simply tidy up. When organizing a room or apartment, apply the rule of five. This rule states that every scheduled cleaning, five personal possessions must be thrown out. This can be something as small as a pair of shoes or as big as a rug or piece of furniture that you simply don’t need. This is a method that doesn’t seem as extreme as purging all belongings. It slowly eliminates clutter, and if cleaning days are regularly scheduled, it won’t take long to really reduce the number of unnecessary items in a very visible way.
4. When decorating, do so sparingly. Covering every possible surface and inch of your wall with pictures, trinkets and banners isn’t the only way to convey taste and create a unique space. Instead, try to limit decor to just one or two photos.
Every USC student in Los Angeles is subjected to intense advertising, making it hard to resist a materialistic outlook on life in such a wealthy city. Adopting a minimalist lifestyle, however, combats this temptation. By organizing spaces and cutting down unneeded items, everyone can focus on future successes, by starting with the little things.

Every year, Welcome Week showcases a wide range of activities during orientation. Directed at incoming freshman and transfer students, the festivities are an introduction to the quintessential USC experience.
This year’s Welcome Week promises the same excitement as before, with events starting on move in day. Events range from pool parties and dances to the more formal Convocation.
Aug. 19: From 5 to 7 p.m., the Ronald Tutor Campus Center will host Taste of ’SC. At this event, expect free food from vendors all over Los Angeles and live musical performances. It is the perfect time to take a break from unpacking boxes and interact with other new Trojans.
Aug. 20: Graduation might close out a college career, but convocation is where President C. L.  Max Nikias gives his congratulations and well wishes for officially becoming a Trojan. From 7:30 to 9 a.m., all new students and parents are invited to a pancake breakfast, followed by a welcoming convocation ceremony.
At Convocation, students are divided into their respective schools, giving a visual representation of the diversity in academia at USC. The individual schools will later host their own events. The events provide the chance to learn more about the faculty, who will attend the events as well. Plus, it is yet another opportunity for free food.
During the early evening, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Bovard Auditorium presents a initiative unique to USC — Vision and Voices. The inaugural program for the year, Spark!, features DJ duo Urban Assault, Lula Dance Company, award-winning writers and poets, acclaimed musicians and USC faculty. As a bonus for attendance, free Vision and Voices t-shirts and bags will be handed out.
To conclude the evening, RSG will host a highlighter dance in McCarthy Quad. Starting at 9 p.m., students can line up to receive a free white t-shirt and neon accessories that will light up the night. Dancing makes the night special, but more than anything it is yet another opportunity to meet fellow new students.
Aug. 21: An integral part of the USC experience is the school pride shared among students. To pass on the traditions, spirit organization Trojan Knights share USC traditions at TCC 450. This will also teach attendees how to get involved as fans during game days.
To showcase the wide variety of USC cheers and chants, there will be a Coliseum rally from 6 to 8 p.m. Students can meet at Tommy Trojan, where there will be a class photo and a routine by the Song Girls. Though the frenetic energy will be palpable, it is just a peek of what is to come at football games.
To close out the night, find the 9 p.m. to midnight pool party at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. This gathering will, of course, include free food and upbeat music and will also highlight one of the athletic complexes USC has to offer.
Aug. 22: Saturday is the day to learn about Greek life. If you’re interested in learning more about some of the largest and oldest student organizations on campus, attend the Panhellenic Recruitment Orientation at Bovard Auditorium from 3 to 5 p.m. or the IFC All Row Greek barbecue at Alumni Park from 4 to 6 p.m. Questions can be answered about involvement and rush procedures at these sessions in a more laidback environment.
The nighttime program is quite possibly the biggest event of Welcome Week. On one end of McCarthy Quad, the carnival includes a ferris wheel, delicious food and carnival games. On the other end, a concert features a well-known musical artist. Past musical acts include Katy Perry, White Panda and Cobra Starship. This event runs from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Aug. 23: The next day,  beginning at 8 a.m., Residential Education holds its first 5K run from Tommy Trojan. All finishers will receive a medal, and all participants get a race bib.
From 7 to 9 p.m., head over to McCarthy Quad for the concert’s companion event. The Welcome Back Comedy Show features a string of comedians telling their best jokes. Past guests have included Jay Pharoah, Nasim Pedrad and Joel McHale.
Aug. 24: Monday is the official first day of classes and also presents the chance to develop some college level skills. Doheny Library teaches a crash course in library research from 10 to 11 a.m. Upcoming papers depend on good research, and tips from this session can help with a successful college career.
Aug. 25: Tuesday will bring more useful tips at the Physical Education Building from 5 to 6 p.m. Stress is inevitable with tests, papers and projects. This session teaches students how to relax their minds and bodies through breathing exercises and yoga techniques.
Aug. 26: Stretching from Trousdale Parkway to Alumni Park, the involvement fair is a way to get acquainted with student clubs and organizations on campus. The fair, held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., is the perfect opportunity for students to seek their niche on campus.
