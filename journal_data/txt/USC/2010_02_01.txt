Coachella might be back with a cross-genre vengence this year, but the biggest bomb is festival founder Paul Tollett’s latest news for would-be festivalgoers: no single day passes for 2010.
Though $269 for three days is far from peanuts, this year’s undercard lineup comes stacked with interesting, diverse talent from cult legends to fledgling pioneers. Here are eight small-print acts that could constitute a trip to the desert come April.
Devo – Could there be a more appropriate time for the fathers of “de-evolution” to play than after decades of political nihilsm and corporate saturation? Mark Mothersbaugh and Co. will bring their plastic hats and a brand new live setup to the festival on Saturday. Be ready to rock out to classics like “Uncontrollable Urge” and “Whip It,” and subsequently lament our societal regression in the parking lot.
The XX – The sexiest music of 2009 comes from four dark-clothed London youngsters whose stripped-down, minimalist composition make Vampire Weekend sound like Aerosmith. An eerie world of nighttime sounds, icy guitars, and deep purrs, The XX’s debut writhes with memorables like “Crystalised”, “Shelter”, and many others. One can only pray their Saturday set will begin after sundown.
Grace Jones – For those who remember the Jamaican goddess’s turn as Mayday in “A View To A Kill”, Jones’ return to the eye of music and fashion is nothing short of thrilling. With a new album and a stage show that would put Lady Gaga to shame, Jones will open the weekend on Friday, and hopefully pull generously from her twin 80s masterworks “Nightclubbing” and “Island Life”.
Sly and the Family Stone – Every Coachella has its miracle act. 2008 got Prince, 2009 had Leonard Cohen, and 2010 promises to bring Sly and his posse to the polo fields on Sunday. That is, if the reclusive funk god decides to show up. Still, even if the announcement of a Sly Stone event comes rife with uncertainty, the mere possibility of hearing “If You Want Me To Stay” is worth staking out a decent stage spot.
Proxy – Even as “hard” house music begins to eat itself, Proxy, Russia’s answer to Justice and The Bloody Beetroots, wields the power to “Destroy” a venue in minutes. As a survivor of a Berlin basement show, I can only express the furious energy of a Proxy set by trying to remember the last time I sweat so hard, and coming up with nothing. Friday’s crowd will not be ready for this Eastern import.
Charlotte Gainsbourg – For those of us trying to shake the final images of Antichrist from our heads, a listen to Gainsbourg’s new LP, “IRM”, will help the processs. Collaborating with Beck this time (her last disc, “5:55” was produced by Air), and coming off a near fatal brain hemmorage, Gainsbourg has produced a haunting, darkly sensuous work of trauma and rejuvenation. The album marks her considerable ascendency from “Lemon Incest” and deserves to be heard live during Gainsbourg’s Sunday slot.
Miike Snow – Hailing from the cold of Stockholm, Andrew Wyatt’s new band sounds exactly like its place of origin: crystaline, foresty, and endearing. This is contemporary electropop at its finest, with unusually stellar songwriting on tracks like “Animal” and “Burial”. In other words, Miike Snow, who will perform on Sunday, are the kind of thrillingly unique, emerging talent that one expects Coachella to deliver time and again. Check out their online video series “Live in the Woods”, and keep your mittens closeby.
Aeroplane – The resurrection of disco has been groped by everyone from Cut Copy to LCD Soundsystem, but no act has embraced the throbbing, cosmic spirits of Giorgio Moroder and Cerrone with more passion than Aeroplane. Slated for Friday, the Belgian duo first gained acclaim for their masterful remix of Friendly Fires’ “Paris” in 2008, but their original compositions like “Pacific Air Race” and “Above The Clouds” are the stuff of heavenly sweet, acid dreams.

The recent economic slump has freshmen more worried than ever about financing their education and has even led some to change their attitudes about majors and careers, according to an annual survey published by UCLA researchers.
The Cooperative Institute Research Program Freshman Survey, conducted by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute, surveyed 220,000 students from 297 four-year universities across the country last fall about their attitudes on a range of topics related to their lifestyles and life goals. The results were statistically adjusted to represent the 1.4 million freshmen who entered college in the fall of 2009.
The survey found that two-thirds of freshmen were somewhat or majorly concerned about paying tuition and other school-related expenses; the percentage is at its highest in more than a decade. More freshmen than in recent years said the amount of financial aid they received was a top consideration in choosing schools, and more freshmen said they considered financial security when deciding majors and careers to pursue.
Darnell Cole, associate professor of education and an expert on student experiences and performance, said the increase in anxiety about paying for college stems from factors such as rising tuition costs and a decrease in the availability of scholarships and grants.
“I think the phenomenon is straightforward,” Cole said. “College tuition has been increasing for the last five to 10 years, and the rate of students taking financial aid has increased. I would imagine that the increase in anxiety is enhanced by the economic downturn.”
For some USC freshmen, the anxieties associated with paying for college and finding a good job afterward are issues they can relate to. 
“In terms of finances, that was a top priority in deciding where I would go to college,” said Alyssa Hargrave, a freshman majoring in animation.
Andrew Cho, a freshman majoring in biology who has federal and private loans, said the financial aid he received from USC was a deciding factor in his decision to pick USC over a UC school. With a recent change to his parents’ income, however, he is concerned about the financial aid he will get in the future.
“I’m a bit worried,” Cho said. “Last year, my parents were starting a business, and I got a lot of financial aid. This year, we’re already established so I’m a little worried about how that will affect the financial aid.”
Tony Tang, a freshman international student majoring in business administration, said paying for college is not a major concern for him because he has not been hit as hard by the economic downturn.
“I’m actually not that worried because my parents work in Canada, and I feel like the economic situation is much better in Canada than in California and in the U.S. as a whole.”
The concern about paying for school seems to be more prevalent among current freshmen than those who started school even just four years ago.
Alex Hall, a senior majoring in geography, said she was not worried about paying for college and is not worried now either. She is, however, worried that her choice of major might not give her the best opportunity to find a job.
“I’m really concerned about getting a job,” Hall said. “I’m thinking about going to grad school now because it’s so hard finding jobs.”
Hall said she would have considered majoring in business if she had anticipated that the job market would not be promising.
“I would have probably picked business because I would have been able to start my own business and make my own rules,” she said.
But according to the survey, freshmen are actually less likely to choose a business major now than ever before — the number of freshmen pursuing business majors dropped from 17 percent in 2008 to 14 percent last year, a 35-year low. 
Pedro Matos, assistant professor of finance at the Marshall School of Business, said part of the reason for the decrease in freshmen pursuing  careers in business is a decline in business job opportunities like investment banking.
“The banks have stopped hiring for [investment banking assistant] programs for the last two or three years,” he said. “Those programs are frozen.”
Despite the negative vibe surrounding the business world, Michael Lin-Brande, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he is still considering pursuing a career in business. Though he admits there is a lot of uncertainty in the job market, he is confident the situation will get better.
“The economy is bad right now, but eventually it’s going to get better because the economy goes in cycles of booms and busts,” he said. “I’m thinking like in three years it will recover.”
Next to purchasing a home, a college education is probably going to be the largest expense/investment that a family can expect in their lifetime. If you have more than one child attending college, the education expense is going to be even more.
Given the uncertainty of the economy over the past year and a half, I think it is natural for students attending college to have concerns about how they are going to cover the costs. Especially, if they have parents that are at risk of being laid off or are relying upon investment returns to cover the expenses.
The silver lining is that Colleges and Universities nationwide understand the concerns of the families and students and try to put steps in place to mitigate the financial impact for them. Some approaches being utilized can include an increase in work study awards, an emergency fund/loan to help get a family through a single semester, or just being flexible when it comes to paying for tuition (monthly payment plans and extensions).
The hope would be that some of these programs can provide relief for students and keep as many of them moving forward with their educational goals as possible.
[…] Freshmen increasingly concerned about cost of tuition, survey … […]

Often lauded for its international appeal and outreach, USC took another step toward becoming a global university last week, establishing an exchange program between USC and members of the National Assembly of Korea.
Last week, Dean Howard Gillman of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and Korean National Assembly Secretary General Park Kye-Dong signed a memorandum of understanding to establish the exchange program between the National Assembly and USC’s Korean Studies Institute.
The exchange program — the most extensive program the Korean National Assembly has signed with any American university — will bring members of the National Assembly to USC and give students an unparalleled chance to learn about Korean culture and politics.
“Through this exchange program, members from the National Assembly will come to USC to attend classes, guest lectures, engage in seminars and workshops and generally promote a greater awareness and encourage an informed dialogue about U.S.-Korean issues among our students and in the surrounding communities,” Gillman wrote in an e-mail.
This memorandum will allow students and faculty to connect with influential Korean political figures who will begin to come to campus in the near future.
David Kang, director of the Korean Studies Institute, said he is excited both for the opportunity for Korean political leaders to visit USC and for the possibilities this relationship hold for the Korean National Assembly.  He hopes students will one day be able to hold an internship in Korea with a National Assembly member and enjoy lectures not only from politicians but also from Korean movie stars.
“What we are trying to do at USC and the Korean Institute is to prepare students for the next generation of leaders … Having real interactions that go back and forth will give students another aspect of how USC is at the forefront of being a global university,” Kang said.
This exchange program will not only greatly enhance USC students’ and faculties’ understanding of Korean issues — the National Assembly will also benefit as well.
According to Gillman, the signing of the memorandum indicates the desire of the Korean National Assembly to partner with USC and to take advantage of the opportunities available here.
Kang agreed, noting that Korea currently has a young democracy that will improve through its connection with USC, giving members of the National Assembly a chance to learn about American democracy.
“This MOU is broader and serves a larger constituency than anything that the National Assembly has signed with any think tank or educational institution in the U.S.,” Gillman wrote. “The strength of any university is its commitment to engaging in and producing research that is non-partisan and makes an invaluable contribution to much-needed discourse on important issues.”
Currently, the Korean Studies Institute is located at the Ahn House on campus, but it will soon open a branch office in Koreatown on Wilshire Boulevard. This location will provide easier access for the National Assembly members and will help expand the program to the Los Angeles Korean community.
“This is a great opportunity to expand relationships with the larger Los Angeles community,” Kang said.

President Steven B. Sample and Cindy McCain were recognized at the Rossier School of Education’s Centennial Gala Monday night for their contributions to global education.

McCain, who attended USC for her undergraduate degree in education and graduate degree in special education, was awarded the Dean’s Alumni Achievement Award.
“I’m so touched and so honored because never did I ever think I would be here at this stage in my life receiving an honor from this school,” she said.
McCain has led several humanitarian trips to improve the educational opportunities of children worldwide. During her time at USC, she volunteered for local special education programs.
“It was really a good time to be a part of it all,” she said of her experience and involvement in efforts to get federal funding for special needs children and provide them with proper educations.
“When you’re young, you don’t realize how it’s shaping you, what it’s doing for you and really how much you have gained from the experience of being here. Being able to look back on it now, it’s shaped certainly my attitude toward global involvement and doing what I do around the world,” McCain said.
McCain, who taught children with disabilities at an Arizona high school after her graduation, said she plans to return to teaching when things settle down.
“I miss it actually,” she said. “I’ll go back to teaching because I really enjoy it.”
The gala was part of the 100th anniversary celebration of the USC Rossier School of Education.
“It is fitting that during our centennial year, we pay tribute to two such committed educators,” Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher said in a statement. “Both Mrs. McCain’s and President Sample’s professional work and personal passion exemplify the USC Rossier School’s mission to improve educational outcomes locally, nationally and globally.”
At the gala, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) presented the Dean’s Alumni Achievement Award to his wife, whose Global Educator Fellowship will enable aspiring teachers and school educators to contribute to the education of youth on a global level.
“Someone will have the opportunity to do what I do,” Cindy McCain said. “The one thing that I have learned from all of this is that people to people and educator to educator around the world, when they see a U.S. educator coming, in some way it’s like everything is going to be so much better. We’re not the answer to everything, but we certainly are willing to give it our all and work hard for it.”
Sample was honored for transforming USC into a global university during his 19 years as its president and for his contributions to teaching and mentoring students throughout his career.
“In some ways, it gives me more credit than I deserve,” Sample said. “What I like about it is the whole academic community here at USC has been behind this globalization, both in the ways we teach and in the ways we do research. I’m honored, I’m humbled, I probably don’t deserve it, but I’ll take it.”
Sample’s Global Educator Fellowship will be offered to Rossier doctoral candidates for international study in Latin America and the Pacific Rim, where he co-founded the Association of Pacific Rim Universities for the advancement of international collaborative research.
“We get more international students now than any other American university, which I think is good for our domestic students,” Sample said. “It exposes them to different cultures and different peoples in a way that nothing else really can.”
Sample said he feels the entire university is strengthened by the advancements of the Rossier School under Dean Karen Symms Gallagher and benefits the Trojan family.
Along with the awards presented to Sample and McCain, the proceeds from the gala will go toward fellowships established in honor of both the award recipients. The fellowships will benefit future Rossier students.
“The gift of education is a gift of life,” McCain said.

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis squad (4-0, 0-0) won in every sense of the word this weekend.
Top · Senior Jason McNaughton played No. 1 doubles this weekend. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
On Sunday, the Trojans faced off against No. 73 Yale University (1-1, 0-0) and swept the Bulldogs 7-0.
In doubles, freshman J.T. Sundling made his season debut after recovering from mononucleosis. He teamed up with senior Robert Farah and defeated their Yale counterparts — freshmen John Huang and Marc Powers — 8-1.
Sundling and Farah had only played together once — in practice — before the match, but USC coach Peter Smith was not wary of placing the experienced senior with the newcomer.
“When you’re good, you’re good, and Rob’s a good doubles player,” Smith said in explaining the pairing.
Sundling was a highly sought-after recruit himself, qualifying for a berth in last year’s U.S. Open doubles draw alongside Trojan sophomore Daniel Nguyen.
Sundling said he was pleased with his performance Sunday.
“It felt really good to be playing again,” Sundling said. “I played pretty well, I was pretty happy with the way that I served.”
In other action, juniors Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma sealed the doubles point by winning the last four games of the pro set to defeat Yale’s Calvin Bennett-led pairing 8-5.
With Sundling active, sophomore Daniel Nguyen and senior Jason McNaughton moved up to the No. 1 spot but were unable to complete the sweep, losing to sophomores Erik Blumenkranz and Joel Samaha 8-5.
In singles, USC gained an early advantage when Bennett was forced to retire from his match with Poldma leading 4-1 in the first set because of an ankle injury.
The rest of the Trojans did not drop a set with Kecki, Nguyen, Lucassen and Farah all out-matching their opponents.
Johnson finished off the day with a hard-fought victory over Powers 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in an intense match.
On Saturday, USC cruised to a 4-1 victory in the first round of the tournament against No. 49 Vanderbilt (4-2, 0-0) on Saturday.
Doubles action started off with McNaughton and Nguyen easily defeating the Vanderbilt pairing of sophomore Charlie Jones and freshman Ryan Lipman 8-2.
Following their example, USC’s No. 13 combo of senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson triumphed 8-5 over juniors Adam Baker and Alex Zotov to secure the doubles point.
In singles play, the top three positions exerted their will with straight-set victories. No. 1 Steve Johnson defeated No. 29 Lipman 6-3, 6-2, and Poldma and Farah secured solid wins.
Zotov defeated No. 47 USC sophomore Matt Kecki 6-4, 6-2 for the only blemish on the final tally.
The victories sealed the ITA Kick-Off Championship for USC and a berth to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships starting Feb. 12 in  Charlottesville, Va.
But before heading East, USC has some business to care of at home.
Today, the Trojans host a match against UC Irvine (3-1, 0-0) at 1:30 p.m. The Anteaters’ only loss was against No. 26 University of Washington.
Smith wants to approach the UCI match as an opportunity to give his younger players meaningful experience.
“We want Peter, Kecki and J.T. to get comfortable competing and winning,” Smith said.
During this stretch of non-conference home matches, USC has successfully defended its court against teams giving their best shots in hopes of knocking off the top-ranked Trojans.
UCI will be no different, and, even though USC will be big favorites, Smith explains that they plan on being fully prepared for the Anteater attack.
“Opponents play very well against us, we know that, and we’re ready for that,” Smith said.

USC women’s swimming and diving team held its winning streak against No. 5 California (153-147) on Friday but fell to an unstoppable No. 4 Stanford on Saturday (119–179).

In the second match in as many days, the Women of Troy were in for a quick turnaround after Friday’s dual meet with Cal, but with the knowledge that Stanford would be a tougher competitor.
“It’s a hard two-day meet especially after being so excited about beating Cal and then to come back the next day and face Stanford,” junior Presley Bard said during Saturday’s Stanford meet.
Freshman distance star Hayley Anderson managed to edge the competition in the 1,000-yard freestyle in 9:45.72 but was unable to back it up in the 500-yard freestyle where she and Stanford junior Kelsey Ditto fought until the last stroke. Anderson took second in a 4:46.51, just .11 seconds behind Ditto.
“Hayley may have lost the 500 but she showed a lot of growth as a freshman,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said.
Sophomore Katinka Hozzsu came second in the 200-yard freestyle in a time of 1:46.40 and was out-touched by Stanford junior Kate Dwelley (1:46.19).
Junior Lyndsay DePaul snatched a new USC pool record in the 100-yard butterfly in a time of 52.72, edging Stanford’s senior Olympian Elaine Breeden.
“DePaul’s 100 fly was definitely a highlight of [the Stanford] meet,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
Bard claimed first in the 100-yard backstroke (53.71) and second in the 200-yard backstroke (1:58.64), despite improving upon her time by two seconds from the day before.
Friday’s meet against Cal didn’t appear to start off well, with the Women of Troy being edged by Cal in the 200-yard medley relay, and Anderson coming second to Cal’s 2008 Olympian senior Lauren Boyle in the 1000-yard freestyle.
Junior Presley Bard and DePaul, however, helped the team come back from the starting slump by winning five events between them. Bard won the                                          100-yard backstroke (53.68), the 100-yard freestyle (49.53) and the 200-yard backstroke (2:00.07).
DePaul led a 1-2-4 in the         200-yard butterfly in a 1:55.62, with freshman Yumi So coming second (1:57.75) and sophomore Tanya Krisman taking fourth (1:58.40). In DePaul’s next event, the 100-yard butterfly, she scored first place and earned a new pool record in a time of 52.86.
Hosszu also claimed a USC pool record in the 200-yard freestyle in a time of 1:46.34. Hozzsu battled until the very end against Cal’s Olympic silver medalist sophomore Sara Isakovic, who touched a marginal .28 seconds behind Hosszu.
Anderson came back hard in the 500-yard freestyle to redeem her loss earlier in the meet and won in a pool record time of 4:45.15, with Hosszu touching a breath behind her (4:45.20). The previous pool record (4:45.85) was held by USC Olympian Lindsay Benko and was set in 1998.
Freshmen Ariel Rittenhouse won both the 1-meter and 3-meter springboard for women’s diving team. The Trojans swept the 3-meter event, with sophomores Victoria Ishimatsu and Michela Fossati-Bellani taking second and third respectively.
“Overall, the [Stanford] meet was disappointing, but we were good versus Cal,” Salo said. “We have a young squad who are still learning how to swim tough back-to-back meets against top competitors like Stanford and Cal.”

Stan Holt cost the USC men’s basketball team Saturday’s game against the Oregon Ducks.
Holt didn’t score a single point, grab one rebound or dish out an assist. He didn’t turn the ball over or miss an assignment on defense.
In fact, Holt didn’t play a single minute. 
But while he was sitting on USC’s bench during the second half of the Trojans-Ducks game in Eugene, Ore., Holt did inexplicably shout at referee Bobby McRoy.
McRoy proceeded to blow his whistle and hold up a “T” sign with his hands. Holt received the technical foul and an immediate trip to his team’s locker room.
On the other end, Oregon converted two free throws and scored the game’s next six points to pull away from a USC team that had fought back to tie the score just moments before Holt opened his mouth.
Oregon defeated the Trojans 67-57, handing USC its second consecutive conference loss.
So although Holt didn’t see any action on the court, he found a way to manage himself into trouble on the sideline.
Literally.
Stan Holt was the USC men’s basketball team manager.
And if you’re wondering, yes, apparently team managers can get technical fouls.
And yes, they can cost teams victories too.
While there are very few exceptions for technical fouls in my book, this one might just take the cake for the worst technical foul I’ve ever heard of. In order to understand the extremity of Holt’s mistake, the situation needs to be put into context.
Two nights prior to the Oregon game, USC lost a close contest to Oregon State, 51-45. In a year where the best USC can do is win the regular-season Pac-10 title, every loss is huge.
The Trojans needed a win against the Ducks to stay as close to the top of the Pac-10 as possible.
Trailing most of the game Saturday, USC used a 9-0 rally in the second half, highlighted by senior guard Dwight Lewis’ key steal and layup, to tie the score at 47 with 5:43 left to play. Although Oregon scored on its next possession, USC was hitting on all cylinders heading into the game’s final minutes.
That is until Holt, a third-year USC graduate student, decided to have a say in the matter.
Holt was signaled for the technical foul with 4:35 left, and all too quickly the momentum USC had built up over the entire half was gone.
And so was the game.
“We were on a run right then, and [the technical] deterred us from having a chance to win,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said.
“After that, the momentum was all theirs,” Lewis said.
O’Neill dismissed Holt from his position following the game. The graduate student, who was in his third season with the USC basketball team, is gone from the program, according to the coach.
Although O’Neill tried to put some of the blame on himself for the call, he doesn’t deserve any of the blame at all. A team manager simply can’t put himself in a position to receive a technical.
In my book, there are only two types of people in basketball that can justifiably receive technical fouls. (The following does not include fouls received within the game’s final two minutes, when no technical foul is worth the points lost.)
You either have to be one of the best players on your team or the head coach. If you don’t fit into either one of those categories, you should never get a “T” thrown your way by the referee.
Here’s my reasoning.
Obviously, a technical foul is giving away free points to the opposition. The only players that can make those points up at a high rate are star players who can score at will.
For example, if I’m watching a Lakers game and Kobe gets a technical, I’m not happy about it, but I’m not too upset because I know within any given possession, Kobe can put the ball through the hoop.
But if I’m watching that same game and Sasha Vujacic gets called for a technical foul, I’m furious.
As for head coaches, they can use technical fouls as a rallying cry for their team. The fouls can be somewhat inspirational and light a fire for a struggling group that needs a wake-up call.
And that’s it. No one else should cost their team valuable points — including you, Rasheed Wallace.
Last time I checked, Holt isn’t USC’s star player or head coach.
A team manager receiving a technical is like a water boy getting an unsportsmanlike penalty during a football game or a batboy getting thrown out of a baseball game.
It’s just preposterous.
Holt’s ill-advised technical foul during such a crucial point of the game in what has already been a trying year for O’Neill’s program was inexcusable.
And now the basketball team has to pay the price for yet another mistake by someone who is no longer in the program.
“Soft Hands” runs on Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Jon at jhaber@usc.edu.
Correction: The column originally stated the number of years Stan Holt had worked for the USC men’s basketball team. This was the third season Holt had worked for the team, not the second. The column also originally stated that Holt shouted obscenities at the referee.   
KO should be fired for his poor gameplanning.  To blame the manager for this loss is laughable.  Who do you blame the loss to Oregon State on?? 
There’s a reason why KO has not succeeded in the college game anywhere he has gone. Bring back Tim! Fire Garrett.
then again…..maybe you should concentrate on baseball.  LOL
In spite of what your fellow students think…and in spite of your incredible knowledge of baseball…I think you did a fantastic job on this article.  Keep up the good work.
“Holt did inexplicably shout obscenities at referee Bobby McRoy.” …… Really? is this fact? Is there irrefutable proof of this. What kind of journalism is this. You report facts as facts and allegations as allegations. Stan should not have said anything at all but perhaps its possible the ref heard the wrong person? I mean he did have his eyes on the game right? I am not sure how you got this job but I can only hope you are the only moron attending USC for Stan’s sake.
As a journalist myself, I would have to say this is a trashy piece of work. You should be ashamed of yourself for producing such a piece of work — claiming that the entire loss of the basketball team versus Oregon was solely the faults of the student manager. This is a team sport from the minute the game begins until the last buzzer. Every single action of the team can affect the outcome of the game. A missed layup early in the first half, a bad pass can change the game, and so on. To punish this student manager by firing him is a sad reflection on Coach O’Neill – he should be ashamed of himself as well. This is about upholding integrity, allowing people to make mistakes, and moving on. I am so ashamed and horribly disheartened by Coach O.
A shallow and poorly developed piece of journalism from Mr. Haber. The technical was not the sole or even primary reason SC lost this game, even if it has been offered as an excuse by the team.  To also argue that technical fouls be reserved just for star players or coaches is also silly logic. The dismissal of the student manager should be better explored since that is a direct reflection of O’Neil and his coaching.
What a terrible Column. Yes, Holt was out of place and should be fired for such a stupid action. People get fired for mistakes all of the time and this one was a doozy. However, the players on the court control whether or not they win or lose. A technical foul cost them a few points, but using it as an excuse for a loss will cost the team a hell of a lot more than that. I’ve never read your stuff before Jon, but this was very amateur. I’ve read better columns by 15 year old bloggers.
Saying the student manager cost the Trojans the game is ridiculous. As you noted he didn’t play a single minute. Oregon was the better team and beat USC. This loss falls on the coaches and players.
Student manager – out of place yes, responsible for game loss, don’t know, didn’t watch the game, but with 4:35 mintues left, think not.  Keyword, student, there to learn, if he was an athlete would he be off the team? Student managers work hard, and are human and will make mistakes and are there to learn, sorry to hear the coach does not have it in him to coach him too. I am sorry to hear that a pac ten title is more important than teaching a student manager about technical fouls.
Cop out – the techincal foul was with 4:35 minutes left, that was enough time for the team to win or lose the game on the court, and not blame a student manager. Did the foul help, no, would they have to work harder, yes, but I think it is a cop out to blame the student manager for the game. It is up to the coach and the team to maintain the run and momentum. Know it is hard to get back, but not impossible.
Should the student manager have known better? don’t know, it is up to the coach to have taught him, but this is college basketball, important yes, but worth firing a student manager for a mistake, don’t know. Has he been warned?
What examples have been set? What instruction has previously been put out there by the coach? Not enough answers in your article. I think the coach and the manager know the answers to these questions. And when sportsmanship is put back in lots of sports, we won’t have as many technical fouls to worry about.
The declaration that the technical foul cost USC the game is simply not true. Unlike others commenting on the situation, I was at the game. In fact, I was sitting in the front row(press row) directly behind Mr Holt. I saw the refereel whip around in response to something that was said and without hesitation, called a technical foul. The technical foul did not cause a change in possession because Oregon already had the ball. Porter made both free throws so the difference in the game was 2 points. These 2 points were no more significant than any of the missed field goals or turn overs that led to Oregon scores. The notion that USC lost the game because of the technical foul is simply not true.  They lost by 10.

He might be playing professional basketball about 2,000 miles from his old college stomping grounds, but, at heart Chicago Bulls rookie Taj Gibson is still very much a USC Trojan.
Surprise success · Former Trojan Taj Gibson, pictured here last year against California, was selected 26th overall by the Bulls in the 2009 NBA draft with few expectations. Gibson has surprised critics and played well. - Daily Trojan file photo
“I miss going to class, meeting new people everyday and the games at the Galen Center,” Gibson said before a recent game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “I miss it a lot.”
Gibson still carries a backpack, but, instead of holding school supplies, the bright pink backpack Gibson is forced to wear by his teammates as a form of NBA rookie initiation is designed to serve as a constant reminder that he is merely a first-year player.
Gibson might only be a rookie, but he is not playing like one. He has started the majority of the Bulls’ games and is ranked second among NBA rookies in rebounds per game. He was also selected to play in the annual T-Mobile Rookie Challenge Game during All-Star Weekend.
“Taj really brings energy,” Bulls point guard Derrick Rose said. “He is someone who plays hard, gets rebounds and knows how to score.”
Part of the reason Gibson has been able to have such an immediate impact in the NBA is because he played for three years at USC under coach Tim Floyd, who was a head coach in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls and New Orleans Hornets.
“Going to USC got me mentally and physically prepared. [Coach Tim Floyd] taught me a lot about the NBA style of play,” Gibson said. “It is a big adjustment. You have to play against different guys, pay attention to details and take care of your body.”
When the Bulls drafted Gibson with the 26th pick in the first round of the 2009 NBA draft, Gibson left behind an extensive legacy at USC. He helped the Trojans achieve school records with three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and 20-win seasons. Gibson was the 2009 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. He finished his career as USC’s all-time leader in blocked shots and second on USC’s all-time rebounding list.
“[Gibson] was a [three] year player at USC, which helped his maturity coming into the league,” Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro said. “He is a great kid. He is always bringing effort. He will make a number of mistakes because he is young, but it is not for a lack of effort or intensity.”
USC’s streak of three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances will end this season as a result of self-imposed sanctions, stemming from NCAA rule violations involving Gibson’s former USC teammate, O.J. Mayo.
“I was kind of pissed,” Gibson said about his reaction to the sanctions. “I was really upset because half of the guys there this year did not have anything to do with that. There are a bunch of new guys. I felt especially bad for the seniors.”
When Gibson has been in town to play against the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers, he has gone to the Galen Center to see his former teammates.
“I saw them on campus the other day,” Gibson said. “They are still keeping their heads high, trying to win the Pac-10. The team is good. They have a bunch of good players that will have a bright future in the NBA. It is a shame that, when everybody finally got healthy, they announced the sanctions.”
The post positions have been an area of strength for this year’s Trojans, largely because of the experience that the players gained from competing with Gibson in practice last season.
“Practicing against Taj helped me a lot,” USC forward Nikola Vucevic said. “In the beginning, when I was guarding him, there was not a lot I could do to stop him. He is a great player, and he is strong. Over time, I was able to stop him a little more. We used to play one-on-one during practice, and he would play hard, push me and foul me. It really helped me improve.”
Anyone who believed distance is weakening the bond between Gibson and USC would be mistaken.
“I am really looking forward to football season and seeing what [coach Lane] Kiffin is going to do,” Gibson said.

Will Mel Gibson ever come back to us? Viewers find themselves pondering this question long before the opening credits of Edge of Darkness ever begin to fall. Two hours later, the question lingers. What has become of the zealous figure on the horizon who once ran down bandits in a police interceptor recklessly, repeatedly spoiled Danny Glover’s retirement plans and attempted to pass as the muck-stained father of Scotland?
On edge · Det. Thomas Craven (Gibson, above) attempts to find his daughters killer in Edge of Darkness. The film is a remake of Director Martin Cambell’s 1985 BBC miniseries of the same name. - Photo courtesy of Warner Brothers Pictures 
Here, in Martin Campbell’s adaptation of his own 1985 miniseries, Gibson turns up as Det. Thomas Craven, a stalwart in the Boston police force and father of Emma Craven (Bojana Novakovic), who has just returned home for a spontaneous visit. Within minutes, their reunion is inconveniently cut short when Emma’s stomach is blown apart by two shotgun-wielding thugs.
Of course, the murder reeks of white-collar undercurrents, chiefly a nuclear energy corporation called Northmoor. Audiences soon learn that Emma, an employee at Northmoor, became involved with a group of activists devoted to exposing sinister, secret projects within the company facilities that involve right-wing politicians, foreign adversaries and lots and lots of money.
Had the headquarters of Northmoor been housed in a looming skyscraper or even a warehouse such projects might come as a surprise. Instead, the massive headquarters sits atop a wooded hill, overlooking a glassy lake, serenaded by the screams of feral wildlife. The last time rural Massachusetts looked so evil, the local policemen were crushing Giles Corey to death with boulders.
Still, the film has a sizeable running time to fill and sends Craven hurtling across the bay state, shaking down Emma’s various acquaintances for information. These include her boyfriend (Shawn Roberts), who introduces himself by initiating a knife fight, a stammering co-worker (Caterina Scorsone) and her grinning boss, Jack Bennett (Danny Huston, who has not been this loathsome since his turn as an animalistic killer in The Proposition).
The film’s director partnered with Boston local William Monahan, who wrote 2006’s The Departed, to tell a familiar story in a time of rising public animosity toward big business. The decision is relevant and smart, but, mystifyingly, the film lacks any hint of rage. Even if corporate crime is not enough to get the blood boiling, surely the calculated murder of a young girl is.
Worse yet, the fire that Campbell and Monahan fail to harness seems to have smoldered out in Gibson’s performance as well. Even as he holds his beloved daughter, drenched with her blood, Gibson’s emotional response seems more appropriate for an undercooked chicken breast. Far milder predicaments have sent the actor into pits of fury and dejection so palpable that viewers cannot help but suffer with him.
Perhaps it then makes sense that the film’s strongest bits involve a similarly detached individual, Mr. Jedburgh (Ray Winstone). Stocky but sharp and strong as an ox, Jedburgh turns up on Craven’s doorstep with information regarding his daughter’s death, all the while making no attempt to hide his identity as a bagman for Northmoor. Both childless, though by different means, the men have little to do but ponder their own lonely disaffection, between the everyday fistfights and car chases and before one decides to kill the other. Their encounters are more therapy sessions than bargaining meetings.
To describe Edge of Darkness as a thriller about a dead child is accurate, only the child is Gibson himself. The last few years have clearly taken a tremendous toll on the man, who appears here as a shadow of the actor he once was. Acknowledging Craven’s very public struggle for justice, the film asks whether it is best to emerge from despondency victimized and bloody or resilient with guns blazing.
Even after one viewing, Gibson still seems the ideal man for the part, but his long-awaited leap forward from infamy is a false one. The firearms are all here, but Gibson remains on the cross.

If the Grammys telecast Sunday and the recent Golden Globe Awards taught us anything, it’s that products that are mass produced to possess inherent widespread appeal have become synonymous with award-winning talent. 
Of course, it’s been this way for some time, and to harp on the grotesque nature of voyeurism and shameless self-promotion in relation to celebrities who were born into this era is futile. What is intriguing, however, is when modern celebrity conduct is projected onto the figureheads of past generations, as seen in Los Angeles this past weekend.
To promote her memoir Just Kids, which was released Jan. 19, seminal punk pioneer and avant-garde poet Patti Smith conducted a mini publicity tour around the city that included a discussion at the Hammer Museum on American artist Harry Smith and two in-store readings — at West Hollywood’s Book Soup and Skylight Books in Los Feliz, Calif.
But to pair the phrase “publicity tour” with “Patti Smith” instantaneously forms a grand oxymoron, for Smith is hardly a celebrity in the modern sense of the word.
“Celebrity back then was not like now. People in rock ‘n’ roll and poets and artists weren’t afflicted with the same sense of celebrity,” Smith said as she stood before a modest lectern crammed into the corner of Book Soup. “There are so many misconceptions, as if we were giant movie stars or something all hanging out with each other.”
For Smith, the act of writing Just Kids was not a well-planned money-making ploy centered around an exclusive tell-all that would hastily rise to the top of best-seller charts. Rather, Smith spilled her thoughts and memories onto the page for one person only — her one-time lover, long-time friend and creative soulmate Robert Mapplethorpe.
“Robert died on March 9, 1989, and, on March 8, I promised Robert I would write this book,” Smith said. “I promised Robert I would write our story because I was the only one who could tell it.”
Just Kids, which marks Smith’s first work of published prose, details the musician/poet’s life as an aimless New York City bohemian in the late ’60s, her first taste of fame in the ’70s and, most significant, her relationship with Mapplethorpe, a photographer known for his stark black-and-white portraits that often featured subversive subjects like homoeroticism and S&M bondage.
Chelsea walls · Patti Smith’s new book, Just Kids, documents the years she and Robert Mapplethorpe spent as artists in New York City. - Photo courtesy of Ecco Publishing 
Smith met Mapplethorpe while she was working a minimum-wage job at Bretano’s bookstore and sleeping on park benches. Together, they pooled their meager earnings and rented an apartment that, according to Smith, was covered with psychotic scribbling and had a stove full of dirty syringes. They could not afford to attend shows at famed venues like the Fillmore East and, instead, would stand outside to catch snippets of the action.
Both artists supported each other’s work. Smith claims it was Mapplethorpe who suggested Smith record an album; it was also Mapplethorpe who was responsible for crafting one of the most famous album covers of all time — Smith’s 1975 debut Horses, the record that simultaneously sparked her fame and acknowledged his photographic talent.
“I never thought I would have a record,” Smith said. “I grew up in the ’50s, where the boys had driver’s ed. and the girls had home ec.”
In 1969, the couple moved into the Chelsea Hotel, a refuge for musicians like Janis Joplin, poets like Allen Ginsberg and numerous Warholian artists.
“At the Chelsea Hotel, the difference between the rock stars and the rest of us [was] the rock stars had bigger rooms,” Smith said. “Celebrity was mostly saved for giant pop stars and movie stars.”
When Smith writes of the Chelsea, she writes of a generation where artists were revered — not obsessively photographed — and art was still at the forefront of society.
It’s a state of mind she still possess, apparent in the sincerity she displayed when responding to attendees’ attempts to snap pictures and record videos for their YouTube pages.
“Please, only take one picture,” Smith said. “It makes me really self-conscious, and I look terrible today.”
But once Smith gave an impromptu performance of “My Blakean Year” and left the lectern, the pushing, line-cutting and grumbling commenced, as the hundreds of attendees rushed to have Smith sign their copies of Just Kids. It was as if the signed hardcover book was more important than the storytelling and performance that had just taken place — as if this signed packet of paper or iPhone-recorded video would deem one culturally significant.
For those of us who grew up in the age where celebrities were meant to be oogled rather than admired, this rings true. But considering most of the Book Soup audience lived through Smith’s era, it’s evident this way of being has become adopted as standard protocol.
At the beginning of this year’s Grammys celebration, Lady Gaga’s flamboyant emcee hammered this point home, proclaiming that Gaga and her music are turning “all of you into monsters.” It was poignant, spot-on commentary — we are goo-goo for Gaga, preoccupied with whatever fashion or stage antic she’ll pull next.
What we’re not preoccupied with, however, is how Stephanie Germanotta became Lady Gaga. But as Smith reminds us, most celebrities were not born into fame.
“People say to me, ‘You hung out with a lot of famous people — Robert Mapplethorpe, Jim Carol and all of these different people,’” she explained. “But nobody was famous then. We were all young and struggling.”
It is within this struggle that makes and inspires the artist, and it is within this struggle that the artist’s true story lies. But just as Twitter delivers information in a matter of seconds, present day artists want success as quickly as one can download a song from iTunes, leaving no time to perfect their craft or define who they truly are. One can only imagine what Lady Gaga would sing about if she too spent her nights penniless on streets of Manhattan like Smith did at age 21.
In the first chapter of Just Kids, Smith writes of her devotion to art and her need for being an artist at a young age: “I knew I had been transformed, moved by the revelation that human beings create art, that to be an artist was to see what others could not.”
It was this notion that pushed Smith to live the quintessential artist’s life of constantly feeding creativity and slumming to get by. And at one point in time, this notion was not a romantic dream as it is now in our black-and-white world of instant success or immediate failure. Instead, it was a conceivable lifestyle more exciting than fame itself.
As the book jacket of Smith’s memoir so elegantly states, “Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy” — dedicated to both Robert Mapplethorpe and the decline of a 20th century renaissance.

On Sunday night, the Recording Academy took the opportunity to dispel any criticism that it was “old” and “out-of-touch” by producing a colorful display of electric performances, heartfelt tributes and surprise collaborations at the 2010 Grammy Awards.
The drama for the evening was set, as industry folk and viewers at home debated which pop diva — Beyoncé, Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift — would steal the show. And when it was all said and done, music’s biggest night ended with a Queen B, a country princess and a royally snubbed Lady Gaga.
With 10 nominations — the most of any artist this year — Beyoncé dazzled with her engaging and over-the-top rendition of “If I Were a Boy,” segueing for just a minute into a cover of Alanis Morrisette’s girl power anthem “You Oughta Know.”
Amid clouds of smoke, the Sasha Fierce star emerged onstage with an impressive fleet of male soldiers, but it was her vocals and studded costume that showed, without a doubt, who was high in command.
The star went home with six awards, including best female pop vocal performance for her ballad “Halo,” and broke the record for most Grammys won in a single night by a female artist.
Not too bad, B.
Taylor Swift was also modestly decorated with Grammy hardware. The singer graced the Grammy stage three times: once to perform with Stevie Nicks and twice more to accept her awards, which included the show’s most coveted prize, album of the year, for her sophomore effort, Fearless.
The night’s best performance, however, wasn’t by Taylor Swift or Beyoncé but instead the show’s opener. Within six minutes of going live, pop supernova Lady Gaga transported an arena filled with famous peers, anxious fans and stuffy record executives to the Fame Factory — making them all her little monsters. From high-energy choreography to her personal manifestation of monster moves, the sight seemed to be plucked right out of a Tony award-winning production.
Gaga’s inspired theatrics were in full effect as dancers draped in nude leotards were dragged on the floor and a screaming Gaga was thrown into a burning steel funnel, only to reappear completely cindered yet still in control. As a new-wave gay icon, Gaga sang a duet with Elton John, which blended her monster masterpiece “Speechless” with John’s classic “Your Song.” On her first Grammy performance, Gaga demonstrated her unique ability to move and inspire the masses.
Unfortunately for her, the performance was a little too late. While Gaga might have made believers out of the audience that night, the starlet only received two awards out of her six nominations, both in dance categories — an outcome that shocked critics and music fans alike. Some even contested that Swift’s top honor was awarded to the wrong lady.
Even still, relevance seemed to be the running theme of the night. Each performance and presentation played perfectly to a year’s worth of momentous events: the fight for music education, Haiti relief and, of course, the passing of music legend Michael Jackson, who was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Recording Academy.
An eclectic pack of music all-stars — Celine Dion, Smokey Robinson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson and Usher — led another memorable Grammy moment by joining forces to sing a new version of “We are the World” for a 3-D Michael Jackson tribute.
The collection of star power was fitting to tribute the lifetime legacy of music Jackson left behind. With each pitch-perfect note, the Grammy veterans brought heavy emotion that nicely complemented the night’s more silly performances, such as the futuristic robot display during the Black Eyed Peas’ “Imma Be” and “I Gotta Feeling.”
To raise funds for Haiti earthquake victims, opera man Andrea Bocelli and Mary J. Blige also teamed up to sing a stirring duet of Simon & Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” which will be available to download on iTunes.
Rounding out what was definitely a ladies night, Pink’s performance of “Glitter In The Air” can’t be forgotten. She balanced high-flying stunts with grace and beauty as she plummeted into a pool center stage, then rose above the audience to drench her colleagues with water, which she obviously didn’t care about. Though she didn’t win an award, Pink, a resilient rocker for over a decade, shifted more musical credibility in her pocket.
Over a three-and-a-half-hour-long affair, the Grammy show lacked any dreary buzzkill that has become a common disease for award shows of its type. Show producers pulled acts from all genres and combined a selective roster of legendary and contemporary acts in a way that was not just old versus new.
With music award shows like the MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards resting on controversy and style, the Grammys offered substance, bringing social reference and entertainment to a platform fitting of the power of music.
Will the steam behind the Lady Gaga bandwagon ever let up? By no means, was she the stand out star. She stuck to her tired and true formula of recycled dance moves, scantily clad Nicola Formichetti styled atrocities considered “fashion”, and crazy antics at a piano…I would definitely not call that the performance of the night; had Elton John not done the duet & had the piano not been so epic, the performance would have been remembered as lackluster at best. Down with Gaga!
Great article Christopher! You covered everything wonderful about the Grammy’s Sunday night! And yes, I agree Lady Gaga was the true winner of the night…with or without the award. It was a magic night in Lala Land.

President Obama’s proposed budget for the 2011 fiscal year, given to Congress today, includes a 6.2 percent overall increase to education spending, part of which will give a significant boost to the Pell Grant program.
Of the $107 billion budgeted for education, training, employment and social services, $2.13 billion will go to higher education and $38.19 billion to student financial assistance, as shown in a New York Times interactive graphic.
The Pell Grant program alone, which annually awards grants for low-income college students, will receive $17 billion, and the maximum Pell Grant would increase from $5,550 to $5,710, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In addition, the funding increase could give approximately 1 million more students access to Pell Grants, according to an earlier Los Angeles Times article.
Obama also reiterated a proposal to make the Pell Grant program an entitlement program, guaranteeing grants to all those whose income falls below a certain level, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.

This past week, the gay community had a lot to cheer about with regards to their favorite stars.
High off the season’s ecstatic award show recognition for Glee, Jane Lynch, the actress behind fiery cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester on Fox’s hit show, announced that she and her partner set a date to be married in May. A nod to her T.V. cast and soon-to-be life partner, Lynch noted, “It’s good to be on the winning team.” 
Also, in a transformative moment that took place on the Grammy stage Sunday, the Recording Academy topped the shock value from even one of its most controversial on stage collaborations — Eminem and Elton John in 2001 — by pairing up the famously gay crooner with a new icon, Lady Gaga. With crystallized sunglasses, burning stage sets and pristine vocals in full effect, the performance was as much of a deep political and social statement as it was a spectacle. Recently, Gaga has been heavily active in the movement for gay rights as the group’s glittery poster child.
But while the current stereotype classifies most people in Hollywood and the entertainment industry to be nothing but raging liberals, that is realistically not the case. While the gay community might have taken two steps forward this week, they also took one giant step back after being hit by the business with a huge, bold-faced reality: rejection.
Vying for a coveted 30-second commercial spot during this year’s Super Bowl festivities, gay dating website, ManCrunch.com, was denied a space by CBS. The network offered the swift explanation that the site’s commercial — which featured two men in sports jerseys, a shared potato chip bowl and a steamy couch make-out session — simply didn’t fall “within its broadcast standards for Super Bowl Sunday.”
With the network’s broadcast standards not clearly outlined, some argued the rationale was instead a simple matter of discrimination. In addition to the ad from ManCrunch.com, another gay-themed commercial was also rejected.
Shocker.
To add to CBS’s defense, the network claimed that the rejection was also based partly on financial concerns, expressing the fact that its sales department couldn’t verify ManCrunch.com’s credit status, a shaky situation for  something that comes with a hefty $2.5 million dollar price tag. With over $40 million dollars raised from investors however, the dating site defends that they could not only have made the payment easily, but they could have also paid CBS in cash.
Nice try guys.
Regardless of monetary complications, it can still be argued that over the years the network’s standard for commercials is highly inconsistent and plays to a double standard.
In 2003, a racy Miller Lite commercial was allowed to air on Super Bowl Sunday featuring two attractive, voluptuous women wrestling in a water fountain, clothes being ripped off until both were in their underwear as they argued over which was the better quality of the beer brand: “great taste” or “less filling.” Though that year’s Super Bowl was broadcast on ABC, it’s a fair bet that guy-on-guy fountain wrestling wouldn’t have had the same appeal on either station.
Clearly, the conflict seems to be content-based, and CBS’s sketchy response is the network’s roundabout way of admitting this. But though it may seem blatantly discriminatory, CBS does have every right to freely pick and choose whatever content they deem appropriate for its broadcast or, perhaps more fittingly, what they think will better please audiences at home and pay the bills.
With behind-the-scenes dealings such as this, Hollywood’s perceived spirit of progressive liberalism and open acceptance to diversity (racial, sexual and otherwise) almost seems like a myth. In fact, in this case upholding fairness and equality undoubtedly comes second to CBS’s need to drive a bottom line.
Given all the recent hoopla  and frenzy over controversial gay acts on television, including Adam Lambert’s primetime American Music Awards performance, CBS executives might have very well made an informed decision not based on their own personal opinions, but what they felt their audience would want to see during commercials.
But for an event as highly publicized as the Super Bowl, the network missed a chance to change perceptions and provide 30 seconds of face time to millions of Americans who might still be uncomfortable with gay rights. A simple commercial could have been the industry’s transformational step to making the topic less taboo.
It is no small wonder that, in the past, the sports world and gay culture haven’t widely crossed paths. It could have been CBS’s crowning moment to change that.
Christopher Agutos is a junior majoring in public relations and poltical science.  His column “Pop Life” runs Tuesdays.
Yes it would still be “graphic” if a man and woman were kissing. However, since a significant portion of the population thinks it is wrong for two men to be kissing, and nobody thinks it’s wrong for a man and woman to be kissing=CBS makes a decision. Not rocket science.
Gays want to densensitize us all so that two men kissing does not make people uncomfortable. But you can’t change reality. That will never look right, to a lot of people. Because it brings up serious questions about society and our place in it, and the role homosexuals play.
So the commercial includes graphic video of a couple of dudes making out, and you wonder why CBS might choose not to air it? As you note in the article, CBS has every right to pick and choose the ads they show. They are undoubtedly going to think twice about airing an ad that could disgust the audience and cause people to click away (as that would decrease the viewership and value of the other ads). So it seems you implore CBS to show the ad anyway, as some sort of charity for homosexuals? The pro-gay movement is far from penniless and disadvantaged; if they think the challenge they face is a PR problem, they should pony up the money for some issue ads.
is it a “graphic video” because two guys are kissing? would it still be “graphic” if a man and woman were kissing? that’s the real issue at stake here…as it seems that the company was willing to pay cash. this may just be more evidence that homosexuals are in fact an at-risk minority. homosexual money is no good at cbs…go to the back of the bus…except of course you mr. geffen.
My point was that the problem for the pro-gay movement is NOT a PR problem. They are supporting a wrong cause — trying to improve the image of homosexuality by “educating” or “desensitizing” the public is a foolish idea. Because homosexuality isn’t just another hairstyle or another flavor of ice cream — it’s a choice that is qualitatively and demonstrably worse than the alternative. Do you think CBS would accept an ad that tries to convince the audience that smoking is healthy, or that eating junk food is good for you?
This piece perpetuates the myth that Americans are “uncomfortable with gay rights” and we need the all-knowing media (perhaps such noteworthies as Elton John and Lady Gaga) to bring us along. In point of fact, most Americans have no problem with treating everyone fairly regardless of who they sleep with. Just because most Americans do not agree with every point on Lady Gaga’s particular political agenda does not mean they require “sensitivity training” of the kind this ad offered.

Cancel any plans for spring break in Surf City this year, the fun is all dried up.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The Huntington Beach City Council voted last week to ban all drinking games from new businesses and from those renewing their entertainment licenses in an effort to improve the city’s “party town” image.
Yes, that means no more beer pong.
The ban started as a voluntary request last fall from Police Chief Kenneth Small, asking bars and other existing businesses to ban the games or risk losing their entertainment permits.
It has now become a citywide rule that is in the “best interest of the community,” according to police Capt. Chuck Thomas, who also says that beer pong encourages “excessive drinking.”
The main issue for Huntington Beach officials is not the drinking games, it’s the excessive drunkenness of some of the bar-goers.
“We had patrons that go to the bar at 2 a.m. spill back out onto the streets and into residential neighborhoods … going to the bathroom right in front of other people’s lawns,” said Councilman Don Hansen.
Sadly, these patrons aren’t your average freshman binge drinker. This ban is for businesses where the majority of people are well above the legal drinking age. According to U. S. law, citizens are officially deemed “responsible” enough to drink at the age of 21. If people are behaving irresponsibly, officials need to punish the real crimes, rather than placing such strict rules on 21-year-old adults at establishments built for the purpose of consuming alcohol.
At what point is this government intervention taking it a little bit too far? No current laws establish that the way one consumes alcohol can be controlled, until now. Several laws do exist, however, that address one’s behavior in public. Maybe it’s time for the Huntington Beach police to buckle down on public intoxication and drunk driving. And they should examine current laws that prohibit public urination.
If the real problem is unruly drunks at 2 a.m., why blame it on a friendly game of beer pong?
Beer pong’s popularity has skyrocketed in recent years, with the current World Series of Beer Pong drawing over 800 participants from all over the United States and Canada to play for a $50,000 prize in Las Vegas. On many campuses, including USC, beer pong and other games like flip cup are staples at any party.
Though the rules vary, in most beer pong games the table consists of six to 10 cups partially filled with beer on each end. So for both sides, an average of four to six beers are used per game. This means the average single player consumes two beers, though it is usually even less because the game is played in couples.
One beer? Huntington Beach officials think eliminating one beer from a player’s night will solve all of their binge drinking problems?
Huntington Beach has been plagued with excessive drinking for years, as a result of the young, hip beach town culture and the renovated Downtown area that enables the partying. In 2009, 34 percent of total arrests were for driving under the influence, and community residents consistently complain about late-night incidents caused by the rowdy crowds. No one can blame them for wanting to change this image, but the issue is whether it can be done more efficiently.
Regardless of if bar-goers can play their favorite game, they will still consume alcohol, either in different forms at the same bar or in a drinking game at home.
With this ban being enacted on a citywide level, it could easily be adopted by other cities and, even more likely, universities. So what would this mean for USC?
A ban on these games around campus, however, might even prove to have more disastrous results. On The Row, a game of beer pong is the alternative for many people to taking shots of hard liquor, a much more dangerous practice.
If the problem truly is the unruly behavior of bar patrons, this regulation seems misguided. We can only hope that officials take a closer look at the cause of unruly behavior and binge drinking before enacting laws that play too much of a parental role and potentially put a damper on our Thursday nights.

It should be the job of the bar to monitor its customers alcohol consumption. Though adults entering a bar do inherit the responsibility of good judgment when entering a bar, the establishment should assume some as well. With the privilege of serving alcohol comes the responsibility of maintaining a safe environment. Shifting the blame for poor behavior towards beer pong is no better then turning a cold shoulder on the subject all together. 
Beer pong does not permit excessive drinking anymore then $1 draft / $2 shot specials and happy hour does. The solution is simple: bars need to reposition a member of the staff to monitor the beer pong area. Utilize tournament style play with brackets, where individuals take turns at the table. The fact is that beer pong drives traffic into bars and makes for a fun atmosphere. Eliminating the game will only hurt business.

Well the people brought the ban on themselves. It’s not the cities fault if people over drink.

Click image to view a slideshow of the concert.
To celebrate Tuesday release of its Kemado Records debut album, The Soft Pack, Long Beach-via-San Diego band The Soft Pack hopped in the F-Yeah Fest van Saturday planning to play ten shows in 14 hours. While a schedule such as that might be normal for an unsigned band at SXSW — last year, The Mae Shi played 16 shows in three days—it’s unheard-of in L.A., even for a PR gig. Filling in legitimate shows with plug-ins at house parties and in parking lots, The Soft Pack’s day was an adventure no underground music fan could pass up.
Stop four on The Soft Pack’s 10-show day found the well-dressed foursome playing Fingerprints’ first in-store concert of 2010. The independent record store in Long Beach, Calif., one of the last of its kind in the greater Los Angeles area, was a hometown stop for the uniquely Southern California garage band.
With a face-full of Fenders and button-up collared shirts, The Soft Pack might look like a West Coast Vampire Weekend, but after loading in late and ripping through five high-powered rock songs, the band proved its latest efforts are anything but prep-school chic.
With fuzz-free fender strumming and frenetic early-punk drumming on a 2-piece stand-up kit, The Soft Pack combine all the raw youth energy of old Los Angeles punk with the sophistication and cleanliness of early-surf rock songs. And while many bands watered down similar influences to make late 90s California punk, The Soft Pack broadcast it in its most pure and enjoyable form.
After working up a decent-sized sweat on the rickety Fingerprints stage, the band sprinted back into the van and shipped off to the next location, which was on the beach a few blocks away.
Several house parties and impromptu concerts with other local bands later, The Soft Pack completed its 10th show of the day after midnight at a hard-to-find gallery somewhere near where Silverlake meets Glendale. Fourteen hours after it started, the greatest record-promotion idea to hit Los Angeles’ underground in a long time came to an end.

The meat market that is known as the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama is the final opportunity for college football players to wow NFL coaches and executives with their in-game abilities.
…and with their performances in Saturday’s game, combined with a mostly-strong week of practices under the tutelage of the Miami Dolphins coaching staff, who led the South team, the four USC Trojans that participated all appeared to make favorable impressions.
Running back Stafon Johnson returned from his well-documented freak-weightlifting accident to play in his first game since the near-death experience that crushed his larynx in September. Though Johnson only rushed for three yards on four carries, he showed some explosiveness and athleticism during the week and proved he can pass block.
Johnson may still go undrafted as he was only projected as a fourth or fifth round pick prior to the injury, but showing he wouldn’t shy away from contact and that there was no tentativeness could very well earn him an invite to training camp (if he doesn’t petition the NCAA for another year of eligibility as he has said he wouldn’t).
Down in the trenches, center Jeff Byers did what would have been helpful for left tackle Charles Brown, who traveled to Mobile but did not play due to a calf injury – he suited up. Byers did nothing spectacular in the game. Although he was the lead blocker on a long gain by Tulane’s Jeremy Williams, his only true highlight was recovering South teammate Tim Tebow’s second fumble.
However, during the week, Byers displayed his versatility by moving between the center and two guard positions and likely improved his draft stock, especially considering the dearth of solid interior lineman prospects this year.
For Brown, after not having the best season, a strong week of practice and a solid performance in Saturday’s game, especially if he could have used his athleticism and been the one tackle to keep the game-MVP, Michigan’s Brandon Graham, from causing havoc in the backfield, could have pushed him from an end-of-the-first or second round pick to the 15-25 pick range.
Tight end Anthony McCoy may have done the most to improve his draft position by repeatedly beating linebackers in practice and showing that he could block in both the run and passing games. If you watch the highlights below closely, you will notice that McCoy has his man locked up in every one of the selected clips that he is on the field.
He finished with only one catch for four yards but likely would have more if he didn’t have Tim Tebow throwing to him. At 6-foot-5, 250 pounds, McCoy has the size to be a blocking tight end in the NFL, but if he can show consistent hands and produce a solid 40-yard dash time, his stock could continue to rise.
With one play, safety Taylor Mays boosted his draft stock. After scouts continually questioned Mays’ ability to make the big play catching the ball rather than solely going for the big hit, Mays showed exactly what they wanted, reading a pass from Oregon State’s Sean Canfield perfectly, breaking on the ball, and intercepting the pass.
Though he didn’t have a great week of practice in pass coverage, that one play probably allowed at least one team to fall in love with him enough to make him a mid-first round choice. Mays continued to show his tremendous run-support abilities during practice and also in the game when he nailed Central Michigan quarterback Dan LeFevour during a scramble on a 4th-and-goal play early in the fourth quarter.
He did just enough to have some team sitting between the No. 10 and No. 20 overall picks salivating come April. And when all is said and done, he and 6-8 other Trojans will likely hear their names called during the two day NFL Draft held in New York.
