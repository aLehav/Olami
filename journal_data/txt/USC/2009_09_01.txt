What do you bring to a football stadium to go watch a game?
If you’re talking about the Sept. 12 matchup between USC and Ohio State, you’ll need seat cushions, drinks and a grill for tailgating — and a whole lot of cash. Tickets for the game will cost at least four times the average face value of $63 — and those prices are strictly for the nosebleed seats.
Main event · The Trojans must travel to Columbus, Ohio, to face the Buckeyes in one of their most highly touted games this season. Fans trying to buy tickets now, however, will be have to pay large sums. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
With a  capacity of 102,000 in Ohio Stadium, you might think that finding reasonably priced tickets for the game would be a none-too-strenuous feat. Not so, it turns out. Field-level seating, available only in the long-sold out contest, starts at $1,000. Seats on the 50-yard line — only two are advertised for purchase — are being offered on resale site StubHub.com for no less than $5,000 apiece.
“Unfortunately, that’s the way of the world,” said Bill Jones, assistant athletic director for ticketing at Ohio State, in an interview with the Columbus Dispatch. “We don’t have a whole lot of control over it.”
It makes sense that the game would draw a crowd. OSU and USC boast two of the most storied legacies in all of college sports, and the pair’s on-field rivalry is legendary. Having played 22 times in the last 70-odd years, the matchup is a close one, with USC just barely holding the edge, 12-10.
Of course, fans will recall that last year’s game was a blowout, with USC dominating an overmatched Buckeye team 35-3 at the Coliseum. The losing team in this year’s match is likely out of the national championship picture, so it’s understandable that the Buckeye faithful would demand a premium price for parting with their tickets to next Saturday’s game.
Still, those familiar with ticket resale admit that the prices being charged for seats are becoming excessive.
“Ohio State fans [just] don’t often part with their tickets,” said StubHub spokesman Sean Pate. “You’re seeing some serious advantage for the seller.”
Southwest Airlines, anticipating a crush of USC fans to attend regardless of cost, has added a flight to its regularly scheduled service, going so far as to offer a nonstop weekender that runs directly between LAX and Columbus.
With game ticket prices that almost demand a second student loan, it seems likely that much of the Trojan faithful will spend this game rooting from the cheapest seats they can get: the ones in their living rooms.

Cornerback Shareece Wright will be forced to sit out for the season because of academic ineligibility, coach Pete Carroll announced on USC’s website an hour after practice Monday.
“Shareece didn’t get it done,” Carroll said. “He didn’t get the GPA he needed to get.”

Carroll told reporters immediately following practice that Wright was nursing a knee injury and that he didn’t expect the corner to play in USC’s season opener Saturday against San Jose State at the Coliseum. About an hour later, the news that Wright would in fact miss the entire season was released.
Senior Josh Pinkard will move from safety to cornerback to fill in for Wright. The 6-foot-1, 215-pound Pinkard returned to USC for his sixth year of eligibility in 2009 hoping to play safety full time. But late last week, Carroll made the decision to move Pinkard back to cornerback, a position where the senior started 11 games last season, because the coach was unsure whether Wright would be ready for the start of the season.
“I think if [Pinkard] had his way, he would like to play all the time at safety,” Carroll said after practice, before Wright’s ineligibility was announced. “But more importantly, he wants to play all the time. And the rotation with the other guys, he wasn’t going to get to play all the time.”
Senior Will Harris will start alongside senior Taylor Mays at the safety positions.
“It kind of worked out for both [Pinkard and Harris],” Carroll said. “Will has had a great camp and has played like a starter all throughout camp … They’ll both have a chance to be full-time players.”
Because of Pinkard’s size and strength at the corner position, Carroll now has extra options in calling plays for his defense. Just like he did last season, Carroll plans on using Pinkard’s ability to mix up his defensive schemes and attacks.
“We’ve incorporated some stuff,” Carroll said. “He plays nickel[back] too, where he can blitz and cover slots and do a lot of cool stuff in there. He’s such a versatile football player that we do utilize him in a unique way.”
u
Junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, who is expected to miss six to eight weeks with a broken collarbone he suffered during Saturday’s scrimmage, will be in a harness for about a week to avoid surgery.
“He’s real uncomfortable right now and will be for another week or so,” Carroll said. “But he’s ready to work his way back and battle back from it.”
With Johnson out, redshirt junior Damian Williams will start Saturday at the flanker position, where Johnson had been slated to start, and redshirt junior David Ausberry will move into the starting lineup at split end, the position vacated by Williams. Still, coaches are looking toward other receivers to step up in Johnson’s absence.
“We’re losing a guy that had the big playmaking ability and the deep-threat speed and toughness that he showed,” said receivers coach John Morton. “But all the rest of the receivers have got the same thing. Now, guys have to step up and play [Johnson’s] role.”
Two likely candidates to get more playing time due to Johnson’s injury are redshirt freshman Brice Butler, who had four catches for 66 yards during Saturday’s scrimmage, and freshman De’Von Flournoy.
u
Redshirt junior C.J. Gable and redshirt freshman Curtis McNeal will return kickoffs for the Trojans. Before his injury, Johnson was expected to figure into the mix alongside Gable.
Williams and junior tailback Joe McKnight will handle punt returns, with Williams getting the nod ahead of McKnight because Carroll has been very impressed with the receiver’s security in catching the football and his playmaking ability after he makes the catch.
“After he catches, we want to see what he can do back there,” Carroll said of Williams. “Joe’s definitely in it. Joe’s had a great camp at catching the football. And we want both guys to return punts.”
Redshirt junior Billy O’Malley will be the starting punter, junior Jacob Harfman will kickoff and redshirt senior Jordan Congdon will do the placekicking.

Matt Barkley is not like you or me. He may never have been, but he certainly never will be from now on.
I’m not trying to dehumanize the great freshman hope, who has been just as impressive in interviews as he has been on the field. Every time that I have talked to him, he has been easy to converse with and seems comfortable with the demands that have been thrust upon him. He breaks the archetype of the present-day 18-year-old while simultaneously reminding you of his young age every so often.
For better or worse, that description also fits his play behind center. When you’re watching him, it’s easy to forget that he’s a freshman until he does something, well, freshman-like.
As USC’s new starting quarterback, Barkley now faces the unenviable task of having his mindset rewired to make sure he’s ready for the season. Normal students might be accepted for their faults or shortcomings, but any flaw in Barkley’s approach will be poked and prodded by the coaching staff, as well as the media.
The biggest change Barkley will have to make on the field is to rein in his gunslinger mentality, which has been a point of emphasis since his arrival last spring. While he has shown flashes of brilliance, his highlight reel plays have been marred by turnovers and errant throws that are a result of his confident style of play.
But trying to change Barkley’s playing method seems unfair, if not hypocritical, of USC coach Pete Carroll.
What’s at stake for the Trojans is clear, as USC is 47-0 in its last 47 games in which it had fewer turnovers than the opposing team. Carroll’s system demands that the quarterback act as a point guard, spreading the ball around to his various weapons.
In the past, players who try to be world-beaters have tended to struggle under Carroll’s reign.
“All the quarterbacks have to stop trying too hard,” Carroll said after Saturday’s mock game at the Coliseum. “That will continue to be the issue for anyone who plays for us.”
Although Carroll’s demands may make sense, his approach has at times been baffling. Despite tabbing someone less than a year removed from high school as the starting quarterback, Carroll has said he won’t have tempered expectations for the offense or a higher tolerance for turnovers.
This is to be expected from the known gunslinger, who threw eight interceptions during fall camp?
If Carroll had wanted a caretaker to the offense, Aaron Corp would have more than fulfilled the role. The redshirt sophomore was virtually flawless in fall camp, showing a maturity by distributing the ball and knowing when to get rid of it. Corp’s biggest mistake may have been being unlucky enough to suffer a cracked fibula that helped cede the stage to Barkley.
But Carroll saw something in Barkley that was undeniable. He has a moxie about him, a command of the offense generally unseen in players his age. He may take his fair share of risks, but he has a chance to make good on almost any throw he attempts.
The bar is set high (and rightfully so), and there will be plenty of bitter moments to accompany the sweet ones, a fact that the coaching staff and fans should digest now instead of midseason. Carroll even seems to acknowledge that he is demanding more than what’s reasonable from Barkley.
“To think, how could he possibly be a finished product at this point? But we’re kind of expecting it,” Carroll said after Saturday’s scrimmage.
The problem in trying to curtail Barkley’s turnovers is that it’s not a matter of simply telling him “stop doing that.” Barkley’s freewheeling style goes back to his days at Mater Dei, where he was a four-year starter and called upon to jumpstart the offense.
Barkley said he wants to get to the point where he is thinking less on the field, but that’s difficult when your instincts are telling you to make throws that would put you in the coach’s doghouse.
The rewiring experiment has been somewhat successful so far, as Barkley eschewed chucking the ball deep for more reasonable routes at Saturday’s scrimmage. But at times he was still tentative, which is easy to understand when he’s trying to compute a wealth of information and make a throw in only a few seconds.
What might be best for Barkley is finding a middle ground. Fellow gunslinger Mark Sanchez looked most comfortable last year when he found a balance between picking apart defenses and making the occasional big throw.
“You’re not going to get those home runs every play, and when you get them you have to take them,” Barkley said. “But the shallow routes will open things up.”
Until Barkley finds his center, a more reasonable course of action might be to focus on bouncing back from disappointment. Whenever Sanchez threw an interception last year, he had a look on his face as though he had just accidentally broken every trophy in Heritage Hall. Barkley will have enough weight on him as a freshman, so figuring out how to take some of it off will be key.
USC fans might not afford him the same luxury, as they demand a near elite-level performance every week from their quarterback.
But above all, Barkley should be allowed to be true to himself.
It’s taken him pretty far up to this point.

In light of the pending NCAA investigation into the USC football and basketball programs, the question on everyone’s mind has been, “How?”
How could this have slipped through the cracks of one of the most prestigious athletic and academic universities in the country? And, if true, how could something that seems so overwhelmingly wrong have been allowed to occur?
Long gone · Former men’s basketball coach Tim Floyd resigned from the team in June amid allegations that he gave cash to a confidant of O.J. Mayo’s. The public relations storm around the university has been fierce. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Controversies such as those facing USC are a dime a dozen these days, as the media uncovers deeper information at increasingly lower levels and smaller institutions. Most recently, Michigan’s football program was accused of exceeding practice time limits. Last week, Memphis’s basketball program was forced to vacate all 38 of its wins from the 2007-08 season because of an SAT violation likely involving former guard Derrick Rose.
The public relations impact from the accusation of violations — even if they are only accusations — are nightmarish for universities. In the Trojans’ case, doubt has entered the minds of those who hoped USC would be a pillar in these dark times for college athletics.
The allegations levied against USC involving improper allowances and recruiting violations regarding former USC guard O.J. Mayo surfaced last year. The allegations against former running back Reggie Bush broke nearly three years ago.
Despite the fact that no decision has come from the NCAA regarding alleged USC infractions, round-the-clock media coverage has hurt the reputation of the university.
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, knows all too well the impact of the claims and the deep-seated impact of the reports.
“There are a couple of things we know — [these accusations are] not what the president wants, that’s not what the trustees want, that’s not what you or I want,” Jackson said in an interview this summer. “Some individuals do stupid things, and it definitely sullies the reputation of the university.”
The public relations impact has been felt everywhere, from the highest university officials to the average student, whose own reputation sometimes rests upon that of the university they have chosen to attend.
“I love the team so much, and I love the school so much, but at the same time, it’s disappointing to me that this kind of stuff happens, because it makes us look bad,” said David Johnson, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering.
Many students who have seen the effects of the scandal wreak havoc on the credibility of the school remain conflicted about what they should be feeling.
“You don’t want your school to look bad because your school is supposed to be a representation of you,” Johnson said.
Daniel Weidlein, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies, also finds fault in the scandals, but wants to stay optimistic.
“Whenever there is a scandal, I want to believe that the person is innocent,” Weidlein said. “I try to find other ways to rationalize it, like, ‘Oh, I’m sure every other school is doing it because USC is under such a spotlight.’”
Weidlein also sees a visible decrease in not only his own interest in the basketball team, but in others’ interests as well.
“I feel like I hardly want to go to basketball games this season,” Weidlein said. “Among people who care about sports, interest has definitely decreased.”
In the future lies a conclusion to the story — a way to remedy the public opinion of the university — but when or where that will come, even Jackson does not know.
“You wish these things could be brought to a conclusion and I think nobody wants to bring it more to a conclusion than we do,” Jackson said. “But life goes on, and you just know that that’s hanging out there. Look at these things, they just drag on forever,”
James Grant, executive director of USC public relations, sees the light at the end of the tunnel.
“We’re all just monitoring the situation and we’re hoping for a good and fair outcome,” Grant said.
The place where the university hurts most as a result of such allegations is in the eyes of the public, and, for the time being, university public relations are somewhat powerless to combat any of the rumors or allegations that have arisen until they are satisfied with their own investigation.
“These kinds of things are always fodder for talk radio and personal opinion; those things will happen, but we will wait until the process is concluded,” Grant said.
He recognizes that it is hard for the university to effect a large change in public opinion when the facts have not all come out.
“In our pledging to get to the bottom of it and clarify what happened when, that’s our attempt to assure everybody that we do care about these things, and expect everyone that works here to adhere to the standards that are set,” Grant said.
It may be some time until Grant and Jackson can see the investigation all the way through and begin the healing process that will likely be needed to remedy the hit the university has taken in the court of public opinion.

In the bathroom of the Arclight Cinema in Hollywood, two women with graying hair and beaded scarves draped over their shoulders chatted excitedly 15 minutes prior to the screening of Taking Woodstock.
“Where were you during Woodstock?” one asked the other, to which she replied with a detailed description of a weekend 40 years past.
Trippin’ · Director Ang Lee takes a behind-the-scenes approach with the Woodstock festival in his latest film, Taking Woodstock. The film stars Demetri Martin (center) and features a cameo by Paul Dano (right). - Photo courtesy of Focus Features
It’s nothing short of amazing how an unprecedented music event has become as legendary and historically significant as John F. Kennedy’s assassination or Sept. 11. The Woodstock Music and Art Festival has come to define not only a generation, but also a radical social movement, spawning copycat festivals and films attempting to capture the event’s original magic.
Yet Ang Lee’s Taking Woodstock — the release of which nearly coincided with the music and art festival’s 40th anniversary — is not about how the paisley-clad counterculture turned upstate New York into a peace-loving disaster zone in August 1969, but the mostly true story of how Woodstock almost never happened if it weren’t for the small faction of naively open-minded townspeople.
Adapted from the memoir of the same name, Taking Woodstock follows a young Jewish man named Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin). A former New York City designer, Elliot has returned to upstate New York to help his Russian-Jewish parents run their dilapidated motel. While in town, Elliot hears that the neighboring town of Woodstock pulled its permits on a “hippie music festival.” Knowing this is his chance to save his parents and their motel from foreclosure, Elliot contacts the concert promoters about using his parent’s land, and the rest is history.
Lee paints an honest portrait of white rural America, one that possesses a bit more color on his palate than the wheat-hued terrain of Brokeback Mountain. The opening of Taking Woodstock is small-town beauty at its finest: open roads, vast fields and storefronts radiating rustic charm.
While Lee’s quiet sensibility as a filmmaker is utilized well in the film’s first half, it falters when Taking Woodstock gains — or should gain — momentum as the colorful caravan of society misfits invades the rural town. As the number of hippies increases, Lee attempts to encapsulate the myriad of activities and conversations with split-screen cinematography. This ultimately backfires, muddling the action and overwhelming the audience instead of capturing the buzzing energy of the crowd.
Though Taking Woodstock lacks with its painfully dull protagonist — Martin’s static performance leaves a lot to be desired — the film features a number of memorable performances from its quirky peripheral players.
As Billy, a young Vietnam veteran fresh from the battlefield, Emile Hirsch channels Christopher Walken a la The Deer Hunter, his eyes constantly darting, searching and brimming with emotion. Hirsch conquers everything from loud, expletive-laden outbursts to mellow, nostalgia-driven monologues with ease; if  only he lingered longer on screen, his performance would be Oscar-nomination worthy.
While focusing on Elliot and his overdue awakening makes for a touching story, one cannot help but wonder how electrifying Taking Woodstock would have been if it followed Hirsch’s troubled Vietnam vet or Liev Scheiber’s gentle and wise transvestite, Vilma.
Much of the film’s comical scenes also stem from the Earthlight Players, an avant-garde acting troupe of Vassar graduates  that lives in the motel’s run-down barn. The troupe’s shining moment is its updated version of Anton Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya, where the performers fully disrobe before an audience of conservative townsfolk, provoking an excited Billy to follow suit.
Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) also makes a hilariously authentic cameo. Dano’s soft voice and carefree demeanor translates well into the poncho-clad Californian hippie who introduces Elliot to LSD and all the psychedelia associated with the drug: highly contrasted hues, swirling visuals and a disembodied sensation that causes Elliot to question where his arms are.
Outside the theater, long after the closing credits have rolled, the two women from the bathroom stalls wrap their scarves tighter around their necks, shaking their heads as they converse.
“If you want to know what Woodstock was like, go watch Woodstock,” one says to the other.
For those flower children looking to relive the era for which they yearn, a documentary like Woodstock is undeniably a better fit. But for those who missed out on donning fringed vests and long locks and feeling like you were a part of something “big,” Taking Woodstock provides a shallow glimpse into the counterculture that fascinated millions.
While not the most factual or informative exposé on the revolutionary event, Taking Woodstock offers a slightly more stimulating experience than staying home with your Janis Joplin records.

You know that ditsy, naïve, overly cheerful girl in class you just can’t stand? That’s Colbie Caillat on her sophomore album, Breakthrough, a dim-witted collection of redundant, uninspired and excessively sunny boy-crush songs.
I’ll be the first to admit my soft spot for Colbie Caillat and her deliciously raspy voice; Coco was a solid feel-good debut album with a variety of catchy and laid-back (though by no means revolutionary) acoustic pop songs. So when Breakthrough came out last week, I wanted to like it. I really did.
Breaking point · Colbie Caillat’s sophomore album, Breakthrough, is a disappointing follow-up to her catchy debut record, Coco. - Photo courtesy of Universal Music Group 
But where Coco was warm and refreshing, Breakthrough is trite and sluggish — so much so that it’s almost impossible to get through. OK, Caillat, we get it: You’re a Cali-girl with a nice tan and blonde hair, you like boys and you love to feel ooey-gooey inside.
There’s a point when sweet becomes too sweet and ooey-gooey becomes just plain sticky. Breakthrough reaches that point — fast.
The album’s first single, “Fallin’ For You,” says a lot about the record as a whole. The tune is formulaic and forgettable, not to mention sappy and unimaginative (I’ve been spendin’ all my time / Just thinkin’ ‘bout you / I don’t know what to do / I think I’m fallin’ for you). Still, it’s one of the less annoying songs on the album.
A few other tolerable songs on the record include opener “I Won’t,” and possibly the only song on the album that entertains the idea that we experience emotions other than love-struck giddiness, “I Never Told You.”
Breakthrough also includes a previously written song, “Droplets,” featuring honey-voiced singer-songwriter Jason Reeves. The song is a bright moment on the otherwise dull record; still, the album version is rather disappointing, over-produced and nowhere near as magical as the acoustic version.
The rest of Breakthrough is remarkable only in its extraordinary ability to make you want to gag — one warm, fuzzy, monotonous song after another. One can only digest so much sappiness before feelings of extreme nausea begin to take hold.
“You Got Me” is the album’s standout cringe-inducing track, an unbearably bland number with lyrics to insult your intelligence: I like you, I like you, Caillat divulges. Oh, I just can’t get enough. Well, we can, and we do — in the first 10 seconds of the song.
Breakthrough falls victim not only to the sophomore slump, but also to the offenses repeated time and time again by the pop music industry. The album is repetitive, uninspired and lacking in depth, never failing to give off the impression that it was written by a 13-year-old girl in her bedroom.
Caillat is the kind of person who’s really hard to hate, someone so bubbly and laid-back that it’s almost impossible to imagine anyone ever shaking his fists in fury at the sound of her name.
But after the torture she put me through with Breakthrough, she might just have to watch her back. I’m slow to forgive.

Bob Marley’s religion is love. Mine is a YouTube video.
According to my Facebook, I place my faith in a 90-second clip of Arcade Fire’s performance in an elevator. In actuality, this is not entirely the truth — I love many other bands just as well. Also according to Facebook, my “activities” are solely “Twitter.” Sure, this is how I spend the majority of my free time, but honestly, I sometimes do leave my laptop — some days I go running, read books, write for the Daily Trojan, etc.
These discrepancies in my own Facebook “info” section raise a variety of queries. What can you truly gather from someone’s “About Me?”  How much does the quote beneath their profile picture describe their outlook on life?
Facebook stalking is a unique art, and I happen to be the next Picasso. As both an ADD-college student and a woman, I am especially inclined to overanalyze the words (or lack thereof) with which my Facebook friends have chosen to sculpt their online personas. I may seem a bit obsessed, but the judgments I pass as a result of a profile once-over are probably ideas you’ve courted once or twice, consciously or not.
If there is one digital mishap that immediately turns me off, it is when someone sprinkles his or her profile with clichés. Sure, some are witty, but most give me the impression that the writer lacks a broad sense of culture. If I read, “live-laugh-love,” I think, “die-cry-hate.” If your music taste is “everything except country,” I ask you to reasonably defend why you hate Johnny Cash yet listen to thrash metal.
Perhaps the most upsettingly uninteresting of all Facebook lines is “too many to list.” I read this as one of two things. It is either: A) You have no idea what you’re talking about — read: you know you like movies, you just don’t know which ones — or B) You are lazy, and now if I want to get to know you, I actually have to talk to you. Rough.
It may sound cynical and somewhat ridiculous, but if you think about how plugged in our society has become, a prerequisite to a developing friendship is Facebook chemistry. If an interest is piqued, the stalking is inevitable — and you do not want to disappoint.
If you hit it off with a strange guy at a party, he will likely friend request you the next day (assuming he remembers your last name). Because of Facebook and all its glory, said stranger can not only see what you look like when he is sober, but can also determine if you two share common interests. Even though we we live in a digital age that makes it impossible to withhold even the slightest bit of information from acquaintances, mystery is still key. Truth be told, it is possible to convey aspects of your personality without hating on the genre that brought us “Redneck Woman.”
Perhaps the most telling response to any of the thought-provoking questions Facebook begs is the text entered just below one’s profile picture. This unnamed area has achieved a reputation as somewhere to write a quote or lyric too important for your regular info page, and as something that is truly “about yourself.” The best choice of words I have ever read in this section was simply, “Something about myself.” Mind-blowing.
The key to a Facebook that receives praise from the general community is that it is vaguely too cool — too cool to list every single band or movie the user has ever been exposed to, too cool to say the trying-to-be-cool “I don’t read” in response to “Favorite Books.” Above all, it is too cool to possibly have as much time and energy put into its production as my analytical skills should warrant.
You may or may not choose to admit it, but your Facebook is more about who you wish you were than who you actually are. You are given a blank slate upon which to define yourself, and there is a whole new set of social guidelines to abide by. Honesty is key, but partial honesty is what keeps the curiosity alive. There is a reason that my profile has a link to a beautiful music video under “Religion” instead of just the word “Facebook.”

When hardcore-rock bands go acoustic, the result usually falls somewhere between the cheesiness of hair-metal love ballads — Poison’s “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” — and the autotune-free whining of unplugged frontmen — Saosin’s “Seven Years (acoustic).” But when LA-based rockers The Bronx decided to make an acoustic album, instead of converting their high-energy jams into listless covers, they channeled the sound they experienced as native Angelenos into original mariachi songs and created a Mexican alter ego that has taken a course all its own.

The Bronx has been an integral part of LA’s music scene since 2003’s self-titled album introduced a heart-thumping blend of East Coast hardcore and California garage punk that defies genre labels. Unlike their contemporaries, The Bronx has little interest in financial gain, image or overproduced recording techniques, and despite signing with Island/Def Jam, their second self-titled album was released through their own label, White Drugs. In 2007, after countless international tours and shows in venues from bars to barns, The Bronx announced plans for two upcoming albums.
The first, another self-titled recording, was released in November of last year and found the heavy-rock five piece giving its vicious riffs more classic rock texture. The second, a self-described mariachi album, was slightly more ambitious. While playing shows in cities around the world, The Bronx became Mariachi el Bronx, turning their respect for the oomping soundtrack of LA’s ethnic neighborhoods into their own English-language mariachi songs. Once back home, the non-Hispanic members of The Bronx added traditional Mexican instruments and new members to play them — including the son of David Hidalgo of Los Lobos. The band bought authentic black velvet mariachi outfits and debuted the results of the cultural mixture to unsuspecting fans at Bronx shows.
Finally, after a year and a half of showing off, Mariachi el Bronx’s debut album, el Bronx, finally hits record stores today, showcasing a hybrid sound that aligns itself with our multi-cultural megalopolis as much as with our neighbors to the south.
Trying to make a regional Mexican album while keeping cred as a hardcore band is a feat in and of itself, but Mariachi el Bronx prove its true interest in the Mexican music that swirled around the band members growing up in Los Angeles. They created an album that captures the essence of Chicano life near the border without offending citizens on either side. Although its concept plays off the different types of Hispanic music present in LA, el Bronx is, compositionally, a rock album. The tempo and structure of each song is the same as other high-energy Bronx songs, but with vihuelas replacing electric guitars and rock riffs masterfully replaced with authentic Mexican sons — or sounds.
Opening song “Cell Mates” characterizes the album, ripping in with fanfare trumpets and intense strums of an acoustic guitar that, for an instant, could be heard during a walk down Olvera Street. But then singer Matt Caughthran comes in with melodic English-language lyrics and instantly turns what could have been a disastrous, tacky mariachi attempt into a complex, catchy and compelling piece that transmits a message of love and hope. Other regional Mexican music shines through as well, like the jarocho style of Veracruz found in “Quinceanera” or the simple guitar-only essence of bolero in “Sleepwalking.”
The concept behind Mariachi el Bronx is brilliant. The album infuses acoustic Bronx-punk with a variety of traditional Mexican sounds like an Echo Park sidestreet. The mix is so right-on, the music might as well be blaring from the speakers of a Hispanic neighbor’s birthday party. Where el Bronx, falters, however, is in its themes. Although its beats and riffs are whitewashed to some degree, the overly dramatic themes of traditional Spanish-language songs remain throughout. Instead of trying to portray a true taste of life around the Mexican-American border, Mariachi el Bronx falls victim to extreme romantic notions, which detracts from its musical message. Definitely worth listening to, but not to be taken seriously, el Bronx is a product of its creators’ upbringing in an increasingly mixed-up world.

Exactly one year ago this week, the USC campus was abuzz in political activity. Both major political parties had just finished their conventions, Barack Obama and John McCain had both hit the campaign trail in earnest and the entire Trojan community was caught up in the excitement of a historic presidential election to a degree that had not been seen in decades.
What a difference a year makes.
Seven months after being sworn into office, President Obama’s sky-high approval ratings from voters have settled down to earth, and he faces growing opposition to both his domestic and foreign policy priorities. Republicans have begun to find their voice in opposition to the Obama agenda, but they are still only beginning the much more difficult process of formulating an alternative set of policy proposals for the nation. There’s no question that the exhilaration of the campaign trail is difficult to reproduce during the arduous process of governing, but particularly after the thrilling peaks of the 2008 presidential campaign, the valleys of 2009 seem particularly steep.
The challenge for USC students — and for young people across the country — is to rev up the levels of energy and enthusiasm we saw during last year’s campaign, perhaps not to the same dizzying heights of an election season, but to a level necessary to help enact the policy changes that energized a campus — and a generation — last year. As much time and effort that proponents of both major party candidates poured into the campaigns, winning an election is a easy task compared to the challenge of making necessary policy change. A political campaign is ultimately nothing more than a means to an end, an important step toward achieving progress for a community, a nation or a planet. The real work has still barely begun.
Campaigns are exciting, but so is the victory that comes from resolving a community’s health care, education or public safety challenges. If either party’s supporters were to muster even a fraction of the enthusiasm for these policy debates in the months after the election that they displayed for their candidates in the months preceding that vote, the result would be felt at every level of government. Politicians know that most voters quickly lose interest once the campaign is past, but those who stay involved can have a disproportionate impact.
The USC community — from President Sample on down — has demonstrated a commendable willingness to stay involved. The number of students and faculty members who devote their time and efforts toward transforming the neighborhoods that surround campus is nothing short of inspirational. But a lesson that we all should have learned from the 2008 election is that even this level of volunteerism and community engagement must work hand in hand with broader political involvement. There are only so many at-risk youth that even the most dedicated of us can teach to read, only so many shut-ins to whom even the most tireless of us can deliver meals. The challenge of enacting widespread change begins with political debate that leads to policy resolution and ultimately, to real-world change.
Just as the USC campus is characterized by the countless efforts to improve our community, it is also the scene of dozens of gatherings — both scheduled and impromptu — where just these types of political and policy dialogues take place every day. Starting tomorrow, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Daily Trojan, in partnership with the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Political Student Assembly, will kick off our third semester of Students Talk Back political lunches, where off-campus policy and political experts join students to discuss the issues being debated in Washington, Sacramento and across the nation. We hope you’ll join us for free food, smart and civil dialogue and the chance to be part of the change for which we all fought in last year’s election.
Dan Schnur is the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. The semester’s first Students Talk Back political lunch takes place tomorrow in the Senior Commons Room (enter through EVK cafeteria). The lunch buffet begins at 11:30 a.m., and the political discussion will run from noon-1:00 p.m.

With speeches here and interviews there, let’s face it: All that ever sticks with us are sound bites — short, 10-second remarks that get straight to the point. In politics, there are obviously quite a few notable ones: President Barack Obama’s “We are the change we’ve been waiting for;” Richard Nixon’s “I’m not a crook;” George W. Bush’s “We’ve found the weapons of mass destruction;” and, of course, Bill Clinton’s “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”
Likewise, in Hollywood the sound bite works just as nicely and holds just as much power and influence. Back in 2001, the everyday MTV viewer gawked at a maturing Britney Spears when she boldly proclaimed, “I’m not a little girl anymore.” In 2005, the media and the American public latched on to Tom Cruise’s manic “I’m in love” couch confession on the most bizarre episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show to date. And two years later, audiences rolled their eyes as a teary-eyed Tyra Banks defensively told the tabloids, “Kiss my fat ass!” after they poked fun at her weight gain.
In every scenario, unsurprisingly, an outpour of media attention resulted — all from just a quick, snappy little one-liner.
Tinseltown’s newest “it” girl, actress Megan Fox, has also apparently mastered the craft, producing a sound bite last week that made headlines across every major news outlet.
With a calculated coyness and self-aware bi-curiosity, Fox, who was promoting her upcoming new film Jennifer’s Body, admitted of her on-screen kiss with co-star Amanda Seyfried, “I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing her in the movie than kissing any of the other people that I had to kiss.”
In the interview, Fox also made sure not to forget to mention the “laughing and giggling fits” she and Seyfried shared “in-between takes.”
Wait. Megan Fox. Kissing. Giggling fits. OK, OK, you’ve got our attention.
While Fox intelligently enticed her typical, lascivious male fan to pay a ridiculous 13 bucks at the Grove to see the flick (and he will), her tongue-in-cheek admission does more than serve as a sexually charged marketing strategy.
Rather, it follows a pattern of sexualized female stars eager to garner media attention, fame and box office dollars at the cost of exploiting a social community that is currently fighting to be taken more seriously.
Fox, a drop-dead knockout all her own, has exhausted her own good-looking self-promotion and has moved on to using the idea of lesbianism as a crutch. It sells, and Fox isn’t the only one guilty.
In the latest episode of the E! reality show Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, LA celebutante Kourtney Kardashian also plays the rating game, as she drunkenly leans on a lesbian at a Miami nightclub and (with calculated self-awareness) eventually kisses her, only to regret her actions later, saying, “I’m so embarrassed.”
Surely though, the producers of the popular program aren’t regretting a thing. The people at E! are probably sitting pretty with stupid grins on their faces, predicting a huge ratings boost any minute now.
And there’s Katy Perry, whose “I Kissed A Girl” mega-anthem brought bisexuality and faux lesbianism to the forefront of mainstream music, commanding the top spot last summer on the Billboard Hot 100 for a total of seven consecutive weeks. While the song was critically and commercially successful, music magazine Rolling Stone blasted Perry for abusing “chick-on-chick exploits” in an insensitive effort to push records and more explicitly, “get a dude’s attention.”
Simply, in Hollywood, the young models for today’s culture — sadly, Fox, Kardashian and Perry — demonstrate that lesbian lifestyles are synonymous with playful promiscuity (both on and off screen), intoxicated flirting and wild cross-gender experimentation.
What? It’s not all about pillow fights, feathers flying around and girls in their underwear? Katy Perry, you tricked us.
Awareness is one positive result that can be attributed to Fox and Perry’s unashamed, barefaced “art,” as they bring the unconventional issue to the entertainment platform. However, for the lesbian community to gain legitimate respect and move forward with their social movement, Hollywood-generated imagery has to adopt a more inclusive appeal and move away from the needs of its current greatest consumer: the average, 20-year-old male college student.
Fox’s trivializing sound bite, though certainly not completely ill-intentioned, is another road block. Today’s perceptions hurt Fox’s own famous friends, such as actress Lindsay Lohan and DJ Samantha Ronson, who have shared an on-and-off-again romantic relationship for more than a year.
Though Lohan once spoke candidly of her relationship with Ronson with openly gay comedian Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the speculation of its validity is ongoing. Whether it’s real or fake, who knows — the idea of Lohan in relationship with another woman sounds so unbelievably far-fetched because of the sensationalized view of lesbians other Hollywood starlets have worked to create.
People aren’t buying it, and they can’t be blamed for that. They point the finger at another attention-hungry fembot eager to swap spit with her beautiful clone to sign a movie deal. The new fad picked up by Fox and others has made it incredibly difficult for some women, including Lohan and Ronson, to speak the truth.
In Fox’s new movie, she plays a monster that runs rampant eating all her male classmates. Now that’s a sound bite.

As the stakes for standardized tests continue to rise, a new nonprofit organization will offer free preparation courses to disadvantaged high school students in Los Angeles in the hopes of improving their college opportunities.
SEE College Prep — which provides SAT preparation programs to low-income students through partnerships with existing college programs — hopes to use USC as its base of operations.
SEE hopes work with USC students to help students gain entrance into four-year colleges. The organization will be coordinating with a federally funded program that offers grants to poor students.
“Our hope is that USC will more or less be the hub of [SEE] in the Los Angeles area,” said Garrett Neiman, the Stanford student who founded SEE and scored a 2400 on his SAT.
SEE  has already established programs in other parts of the state, with partnerships at Stanford University and UC Irvine. SEE offers a five-week, 42-hour program and curriculum designed by students from Stanford, according to the programs website.
“This last summer we helped over 500 students,” said Austin Hay, a USC sophomore majoring in environmental engineering and SEE’s vice president of programs. “The average improvement score was 240 points.”
As SEE expands into Southern California, Neiman hopes USC students will be a driving force in the program, both as tutors and volunteers.
The main obstacle to finding volunteers is their test scores, Hay said, because SEE requires students to score in the 99th percentile across the board. As a result, many applicants are ineligible from the beginning.
But Hay said he is still attempting to gather interest for the launch next summer. SEE is currently seeking tutors, recruiters, managers and advertisers.
“Students would find it fulfilling to help [other] students, who are not as privileged, get into a school like USC,” Hay said.
Laura Welch, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she knew students who didn’t take the SAT because of the cost, and said she would be interested in helping kids in similar situations by working as a tutor for SEE.
“Especially since we’re so fortunate to be here,” Welch said. “[By taking SEE], it doesn’t matter where you come from or your financial situation.”
According to Neiman, SEE also helps the communities where students take the nonprofit classes by recruiting the program’s top graduates as tutors.
“By bringing back role models from those communities, we give students access to peers who really made it,” Neiman said.

One night last year, Noel Arreola, an undecided sophomore, waited for a Campus Cruiser that never came.
“A cruiser never came at all and I ended up walking because I wasn’t sure what had happened,” Arreola said.
Cellular · Students using Campus Cruiser will now receive a text or a call when the cruiser arrives, rather than waiting for it outside. - Carlos Acenas | Daily Trojan
Another time last year, Arreola called Campus Cruiser, a free taxi service for USC students, before it closed and was still on hold at
2:45 a.m., past the program’s hours of operation.
But this past Saturday night, Arreola received a phone call to notify her that her cruiser had arrived at her pickup location, part of Campus Cruiser’s new initiative to notify students with an automated text message or phone call once their cars have arrived.
The changes to the Campus Cruiser system mean students will no longer have to wait outside for their rides or miss pickups altogether — an issue that was common before this fall.
“For whatever reason, people were missing their cruisers, so we thought this was a better way they could get to Cruiser on time,” said Campus Cruiser Manager John Zajac.
Campus Cruiser started the system at the recommendation of USC students and tested it during the summer.
Cruiser is also providing a new phone line that allows students to immediately check the status of requested rides by putting in a confirmation number or the first letters of their last name.
“Based on feedback from students, USG, URSC, and really from all campus cruisers that work in the program, it came to our attention that it was something that the students really wanted,” said Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation.
During the initial testing stages, Zajac said the service provider was not consistently sending the callback messages to students, but since the start of this semester, most students seem to be receiving their notifications.
“Everyone is extremely pleased with the program … the reliability has been 100 percent and I think it’s going to be a huge enhancement to the program,” Mazza said.
After analyzing data from the first week of the school year, Mazza said the automated phone callback was requested more often than the text message.
Between Thursday and Sunday, Mazza said, Cruiser recorded 1,345 telephone notifications and 493 text message notifications.
Mazza added that the first weekend of the academic year is typically the busiest for Campus Cruiser.
Campus Cruiser received 4,064 calls during the first week of classes from August 24-30, Mazza said.
The notification system also seems to have made Cruiser more efficient, and Zajac said fewer students have been missing their cruisers.
Cruiser driver Julius Cotton, a junior majoring in business and critical studies, said he thinks it is unsafe for students to wait outside for five to 10 minutes for a car later at night, especially alone.
Cotton said he thinks the new notification system that goes directly to the students even if they aren’t outside, will help solve that issue.
“It will make sure that people are getting their cruisers and it will also increase safety because people aren’t just being left stranded, as some people might have felt before,” said driver Alyssa Whitcomb, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning.
While Cruiser averaged 8.9 minutes to pick up passengers during the first week, 14 percent of calls took longer than 15 minutes to receive a cruiser pickup, Mazza said.
“We will see the number of students that have to wait an excess of 15 minutes begin to diminish after we get up to the number of students that we need to staff the program, which is 120. The goal is to do that by Sept. 15,” Mazza said.
Though Mazza is still working to decrease the wait time for rides, Cruiser drivers say they have received only positive feedback about the new system already in place.
“Most of the people that I pick up are actually really excited that they get [a notification] because sometimes they get left if they don’t make it on time,” Whitcomb said.
Whitcomb noted most people do not realize that cruisers will leave after five minutes if their passengers do not show up.
According to Whitcomb, Campus Cruiser has increased the number of its employees in order to handle more calls. Despite the recent improvements, however, some students still found problems with Cruiser.
Sophomores Tiffany Tsai and Esmeralda Ayala live on a tram route, and sometimes Campus Cruiser refuses to provide them with transportation services.
“I understand that they’re trying to save cruisers for other people, but I don’t want to take the tram by myself to a place that I really don’t know,” said Ayala, a sophomore majoring in mathematics.
Ayala says she thinks Cruiser should provide rides even along tram routes, especially for students traveling alone or late at night.
Lisa Ren, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics, said she would like Campus Cruiser to provide additional phone lines for students to request pickups, as students are often placed on hold.
To help ease transportation troubles even more, USC Transportation is also working on a partnership with Zim Ride, a program to match commuters through social networking sites like Facebook to coordinate rides to and from campus. The Zim Ride program should be in place in about 30 days and only students and employees will be able to access it, Mazza said.
The department will also add six Zipcars to the 16 existing vehicles on campus within about 30 days, Mazza said. Another six Zipcars will be placed around USC’s northern campus by the City of Los Angeles, for a total of 28 available cars and around the USC campuses.

Despite fears that the economic downturn would affect this semester’s Greek recruitment numbers, representatives from the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council said membership growth for the fall semester remained steady.
“This summer we were looking at the numbers at other universities and [when] we saw drops anywhere we were terrified, but our numbers were fairly strong,” said Blessing Waung, Panhellenic president.
IFC said it had 1,020 men participate in fall rush and offered a total of 468 bids, representing a slight jump from the 438 of the previous year.
This fall also marked the first time IFC was able to keep track of all men who rushed a fraternity by using a newly created online database system.
“This is the first time we’ve had substantive data. In the past it wasn’t tracked with this kind of precision,” IFC President Nick Hamada said.
Additionally, instead of closing the rush process Sunday after bid night, as in previous years, IFC ruled that interested fraternities could use this week as a secondary bid period, during which they can extend bids to men who may not have received one during the original bid process. Hamada said he hoped this would give chapters the chance to retain potential pledges.
Panhellenic rushed 842 women, demonstrating a registration rate consistent with the numbers from last year, but only accepted a class of 539 bids, a 7 percent decrease compared with 579 from last fall.
Waung said she attributed the decrease in recruitment to the various financial troubles students are experiencing.
“We at Panhellenic have to adapt to the economy in the same ways as other organizations,” Waung said.
Although sorority recruitment numbers were down, Panhellenic Vice President of Recruitment Hilary Veit said this decrease was marginal compared to other universities, where chapters are losing hundreds of potential new members.
As part of their efforts to deal with the economic downturn, Waung said Panhellenic focused on being more upfront about sorority dues and stressing long-term financial benefits, such as living in their chapter’s house.
Christina Pushaw, a sophomore majoring in history who dropped out of rush, said finances were a consideration in her decision, as she would have to pay her own dues.
“I really would have to feel totally sure about joining a house before I spent my own money on it,” she said. “Whereas if my parents were paying for it, it might be a different story.”
Kelly Williams, a sophomore majoring in print journalism who also dropped out of rush, said she thought most prospective pledges would have known about the finances beforehand.
“I don’t feel like any girl is going to join a sorority and not know that there are dues. Everyone is well aware going in to it that there is a financial commitment as well as a time commitment,” she said.
Still, some girls think joining a sorority is worth it, despite the cost.
Hailey Andrews, a transfer student and sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, said when she discussed college with her parents she first decided to save money to pay for sorority recruitment and dues.
“My parents always told me they’d help pay for college, but I had to pay for dues if I wanted to join a sorority,” Andrews said. “I think knowing I did it on my own makes it even more fulfilling.”
Panhellenic is planning to work with individual chapters to provide scholarships if students interested in joining a sorority are seriously concerned about paying for the dues.
“We’re trying to save money in our budget wherever possible to have some sort of surplus to allocate for scholarships,” Veit said.
Waung noted one of her goals for the semester is to establish a yearly Panhellenic scholarship in memory of Adrianna Bachan, the freshman from the Pi Beta Phi sorority who was killed in a hit-and-run last spring.

Two weeks after his trial began, the Los Angeles man accused of fatally stabbing USC student Bryan Frost last fall was found guilty of second-degree murder Monday afternoon.
Travion Ford, 25, now faces 16 years to life in state prison for the Sept. 18 incident, when Frost slammed a metal gate closed near the intersection of 29th Street and Orchard Avenue, sparking a fight between the two.
After the men initially fought, Ford ran inside his mother’s apartment and retrieved a knife, which he used to stab Frost during a second alteraction.
Frost, who was 23 years old and a cinema student, later died of a stab wound to the heart, Deputy District Attorney Kennes Ma said in his opening statement Aug. 20.
Although the 12-person jury did not convict Ford of first-degree murder — the most severe charge he faced — it did reject his attorney’s argument that her client stabbed Frost, a former West Point cadet, to protect his own life.
“The only reason Mr. Ford used deadly force was because he felt his life was in danger and he would die,” Diane Butko, Ford’s attorney, said in her opening statement.
Ma said he thought the jury’s ruling was fair.
“Obviously I wouldn’t have argued for murder if I didn’t think there was evidence for it,” he said. “I really believe the jury made the correct decision based on the evidence.”
Anquenette Young, Ford’s fiancée and the mother of his 4-month-old son, was shocked by the jury’s decision.
“That’s not fair,” she said after learning of the verdict.
Frost’s mother Paige Lee, who traveled to Los Angeles from Idaho with other members of his family and friends for the trial, said she and Frost’s father, Jere Frost, were “grateful” for the ruling.
“It’s so hard, because nothing is going to bring my son back, but certainly you want to see the truth be told,” she said. “To have Bryan be vindicated in all of this … he was the victim. He was not the bad guy here. He was the victim.”
Still, Lee said the day was filled with mixed emotions.
“It’s kind of a lose, win, lose,” she said. “We win the verdict, but we still lost because we’ll never have him back.”
Ford is due back in court for his sentencing Oct. 29. At that point, Frost’s family will be given the opportunity to address Ford. Ma said the family planned to return to Los Angeles in order to do so.

As the Station fire continues to grow — more than doubling in size Sunday night — USC has extended an offer of support to students and families who may be affected.
The fire, which started burning Aug. 26 and had spread across 105,000 acres  by Monday night, forced evacuations in several towns in northeast Los Angeles County and displaced many USC students and their families.

USC sent an email Monday afternoon to students whose permanent addresses are in the areas threatened by the fire.
The email, sent by Andrea Torres, director of student support and advocacy in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, offered support and counseling for students victimized by the fire.
Burning in the Angeles National Forest and surrounding areas, the fire had destroyed 53 structures including residences as of 6 p.m. Monday, according
to the County of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management.
The fire was also threatening Mt. Wilson and the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where USC has a 60-foot solar tower. Mt. Wilson hosts TV and radio towers and multimillion-dollar astronomy projects from other schools, as well.
The Station fire ­— the largest of eight fires currently burning in the state — was only 5 percent contained as of Monday night.

With the smoke from the Station fire highly visible from USC’s campus, officials are warning of the health issues the fires could cause for students.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department has issued five air-quality alerts since the fire began. The alerts warn children, the elderly and those with heart and respiratory diseases to be especially cautious and not go outside.

Los Angeles County health authorities are also telling residents to stay inside and avoid outdoor activities because of air polluted by wildfire smoke and ash.
“Even if there’s no visible smoke or odor, the air quality is not good for sensitive individuals throughout the entire county,” said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
Though many schools around Los Angeles — including in Altadena, La Canada, Flintridge, La Crescenta, Tujunga and Sunland — have suspended outdoor activities, USC has not issued any official precaution to suspend outdoor activities and the USC football scrimmage occurred as scheduled on Saturday.
“Nobody has mentioned any kind of air-quality issues that need to be addressed in that way,” said James Grant, executive director of USC media relations.
Still, some USC athletes have taken it upon themselves to avoid training outdoors. USC Triathlon team member Anthony So sent an email out to all the triathlon members advising them not to train over the weekend, or to instead work out at the beach where the air is cleaner.
“Training in such poor air quality does nothing to help the body,” said So, a senior majoring in theatre. “There is no such thing as resistance training for your lung capacity via smoke and ash inhalation.”
Triathlon team member Natalie Hwang did not heed her teammate’s warning until she was in the middle of her workout.
“I was planning on riding up to Griffith Park but when I got halfway to Griffith Park and I still couldn’t see the observatory, I decided my lungs shouldn’t be taking in that air,” said Hwang, a junior majoring in engineering.
Some students are experiencing allergies and asthma irritation.
“The first day of the fires I sneezed a lot,” said Andrea Santos, a junior majoring in theatre. “I would get out of class and I’d be riding my bike and I’d have to stop…so that I wouldn’t crash.”
Rebecca Suzuki, a sophomore majoring in stage management, had adolescent asthma and has been experiencing recurring symptoms since the fire began.
“In the morning I walked out and it was kind of smoky and you couldn’t see as well and it smelled really strong,” Suzuki said. “I really try to avoid the air when it’s this poor quality.”
Fielding held a conference call Thursday to discuss air quality and heat concerns. According to Fielding, high temperatures and low winds have worsened the air quality, pushing smoke closer to the ground and not allowing it to escape from the basin.
“The greatest concern is that the smoke is composed largely of very small particles that can go deep into the lung tissue,” Fielding said. “The particles cause irritation … Eye irritation and coughing and can exacerbate asthma attacks and those are the ones that can lead to bronchitis or other respiratory problems.”
