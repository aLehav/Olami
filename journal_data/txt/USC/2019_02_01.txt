A women’s soccer mural in the John McKay Center proudly flaunts the program’s history on big glass squares: two national championships, 14 All-Americans and 77 All-Pac-12 Conference players. At the end of her collegiate career, senior forward Leah Pruitt has checked nearly all the boxes. 
And if the wall was keeping count of professional players, she would have raised that number, too. 
It was the 75th minute of the 2016 Women’s College Cup Championship when Pruitt chased down the ball as it headed out of bounds, kept it on the field and beat a defender to cross it to an open teammate for USC’s second goal of the game, which broke a 1-1 tie to secure the title.   
“Ninety-five percent of the people who play the game would see that ball heading toward out of bounds, and they would stop running,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “They would slow down; they would give up on it; they would wait for the throw-in.”
But Pruitt’s competitive edge wouldn’t let her watch the ball roll away, and her unparalleled speed propelled her to save it. McAlpine reflected on the brilliance of that assist, noting “the pace, the power, the drive, the determination.”  
And it was only Pruitt’s first year as a Trojan. 
By her junior year, she earned All Pac-12 honors and rounded it out with All-American recognition as a senior.
Much of Pruitt’s success can be credited to one factor: Defenders don’t want to deal with her. She will outrun players, shove anyone who shoves her and play the entire field to control the ball. Her six game-winning goals this season — the most in the Pac-12, —have proven that defenders can’t contain her.
“She’s a beast,” McAlpine said. “She’s so powerful. But, she’s so elusive.”
She never gives up on a play, and she’s been the same player since she was seven years old, when she touched the ball for the first time. Jalen Woodward, junior midfielder and Pruitt’s best friend, remembers playing against her in elementary school, even though they didn’t meet and become friends until they played at USC.
“She was always someone that we had to mark and make sure we knew where she was,” Woodward said. “She was always on our scouting reports because she was so good, even at a young age.” 
Pruitt’s speed puts her above the rest, bringing out her natural drive to win and a competitive streak that can’t — and shouldn’t — be suppressed. 
“She’s a competitor like no other,” Woodward said, without hesitation.
But off the field, she’s just Leah, walking around campus with her soft, easygoing smile, emanating a joy as contagious as the effort she puts into practice and bringing laughter to every team meeting. Pruitt’s personality flickers during competition when she gets trucked by a defender and stands right back up, flashing that powerful smile. 
“It’s amazing to give that kind of effort all the time, be exhausted all the time, but smile through any and everything that happens,” McAlpine said.
She’s dynamic and selfless — a combination that drives her as a forward to defend from up top and help her teammates out all over the field.
“I know my teammates are going to work hard for me,” Pruitt said. “So I want to work hard for them. I’ll chase down any ball.”
Pruitt leads by example, always giving her best on every rep of every drill in practice, and it shows on the field. Whether it’s the first minute of the game or the last in overtime, she’s working as if the game is on the line and pushing her teammates to do the same. Pruitt has never been the most vocal, but when she speaks, people listen. 
“People look [to her] to fuel their own fire,” Woodward said. 
It’s only fitting that she’s the team motivator, the same role that Pruitt takes on in her hyper-athletic family of five. When she doesn’t feel like getting up to work out, she’ll do it anyway. 
“She knows what she wants, and she knows in order to get it, she has to work hard,” said Pruitt’s father, Aaron. “That’s a motivational factor for myself, my wife, her brother and sister. It always has been.” 
It comes from those early weekend mornings when the Pruitt household started rumbling at 7 a.m. to get the girls to soccer, her brother to wrestling practice and parents to the gym. As a former Division I athlete, her father always stressed the importance of getting up and starting days early. They hardly ever slept in. 
It was probably this very drive that pushed her to transfer from San Diego State after her freshman year. According to McAlpine, she could sense there was something more for her. 
Pruitt’s undying commitment to her career flew her and her father from Los Angeles to Chicago on Jan. 10 for the National Women’s Soccer League Draft. They were expecting her to get drafted in the second or third round, until they were assigned the first seats in the front row, right in the corner. They moved to sit with Ally Prisock, Pruitt’s teammate at USC and fellow draftee, but organizers promptly moved them back to their assigned seats. 
That’s when Aaron knew Leah’s name would be called quicker than they thought. 
And it was — in the first round, fifth overall to the North Carolina Courage. McAlpine had a good feeling that Pruitt wouldn’t get past the sixth pick, but he let her have the raw experience. 
“It was really surreal,” Pruitt said in reflection. 
Her father wasn’t shocked. He watched his youngest daughter, who had always wanted to play professional soccer, wrap her new team’s scarf around her neck, absorbing the emotions of the moment. 
“To have one of her goals in life be fulfilled, and to be there firsthand and see it — it was tremendous,” Aaron said.
Pruitt stood in front of viewers across the country and thanked her supporters from USC. On Feb. 28, she’ll be leaving behind the only state she’s ever called home to begin her career as a professional athlete, while finishing two online classes at USC to graduate in May. She’ll earn a degree in sociology and a minor in forensics and criminality. 
“I feel the same,” Pruitt said of going pro. “I’m not gonna feel like a pro until I’m there, playing with the best players I’ve ever played with. Right now, I don’t really have a name for myself there, so I’m just working to keep doing what I do to get minutes.”
In his 18-year head coaching career, McAlpine has seen impressive Trojan talent come and go — namely Amy Rodriguez, the first overall pick in 2009 and current U.S. Women’s National Team forward, along with midfielder Morgan Andrews, the third overall pick in 2017. But to him, Pruitt still stands in a category of her own. 
“I think there are players that have gone pro from here that are maybe more talented, just individually [on the ball],” McAlpine said. “But I have a hard time thinking that any of them will have a better career because of her joy and the way she’s gonna work at being the best.”

No. 15 USC men’s volleyball took down the Princeton Tigers in a 3-0 victory at Galen Center Thursday night.
Senior outside hitters Jack Wyett and Ryan Moss led the Trojans offensively with 12 kills each, and sophomore setter Chris Hall aided with 31 assists. Wyett and freshman outside hitter Brandon Browning anchored the defense with 5 and 4 digs, respectively. Senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso, typically an asset on the hardwood, was on the sidelines for an injury. but he is expected to be back to play against UC Irvine Saturday.
The first set stayed close with the two teams trading small leads until the Trojans pulled ahead 19-14. The Tigers narrowed the gap once again to put the score at 19-17, but never fully caught up, allowing USC to secure a 25-22 victory.
The second set mirrored the first, with neither team picking up a strong lead at the start until USC scored 4 consecutive points for a 14-7 lead and stayed ahead for the remainder of the set. The Tigers did keep things interesting, narrowing in on the Trojans 24-22, but USC scored the last point for a 25-22 finish.
Princeton scored the first point of the third set and USC answered back to ultimately keep the lead for the entire set. Although the Tigers kept up, they never managed to change the lead and USC went uncontested for a 25-21 set.
“Tonight I think we played with a lot of consistency,” Moss said. “I was really proud of Browning, who stepped into the starting role and played really well. [Sophomore libero] Cole Paxson came in the third set and played really well, so it was a full team effort, and I think we played a complete match which is what we want to do.
Even though the score slipped a few times, the Trojans reclaimed their leads with poise.
“We got knocked on our heels a couple times with some service errors and sloppy plays, but we were able to bring it back, which was good to see,” Moss said.
On Saturday, the Trojans travel to No. 4 UC Irvine, who they upset 3-1 last week even though the Trojans were unranked and the Anteaters were No. 3.
Unless any drastic changes are made to UC Irvine’s roster, the Trojans will not prepare for the game any differently.
“I think it’s really on how we play on our side,” Moss said. “If we play our best game, and everybody clicks and we get into that mentality and emotional mindset, that lets us play our best volleyball. That’s all we really need to focus on is that consistent level of play, regardless of the opponent. We need to bring the same mentality to every game,” Moss said.
The match will begin at 7 p.m. Saturday in Irvine at the Bren Events Center. 
“We’re going to be at their place, we expect it to be loud and we expect that they’ll want to get revenge, so we’re prepared for a fight. We’re ready to go in there and compete really hard,” Moss said.

Finally. 
Finally, Trojan football has someone in charge of their offense. Finally, USC Athletics has made a choice that fans will back. Finally, the future of USC football has a glimmer of hope. 
Former North Texas offensive coordinator Graham Harrell is certainly a welcome addition to the coaching staff. The best part about the hire is that it reconciles much of the pain from the loss of Kliff Kingsbury, who left USC for the Arizona Cardinals a month after he was hired. It’s important to acknowledge that Harrell is no Kingsbury; the former NTU coach has yet to prove himself in a Power Five conference. While he doesn’t have a long track record,  Harrell certainly brings a very intriguing resume to the table.
I have no doubts that implementing an air-raid offense is the right choice for the Trojans going into the 2019 season. This is why I — like most fans and alumni — was so excited about the Kingsbury hire. 
First and foremost, the 2019 Trojans’ ground game is largely up in the air. The loss of former senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware significantly hurts the Trojans’ run game. Left on the back personnel are rising juniors Stephen Carr and Vavae Malepeai. Both are solid backs, but come with flaws.
Malepeai is a gritty, goal-line type of back. He found that niche last season, after pounding in touchdowns from a couple yards out and converting on third and short. It’s unlikely that he will be a consistent first-down player. Last season, he filled a necessary spot for the Trojans, and he did a great job at it. But at the same time, that doesn’t mean he can step up and fill the first string spot in 2019.
Carr is a different story — he is the preeminent candidate to fill the starting spot. He has a lot of potential and could prove to be a success for the Trojans this upcoming season. The main problem: He has to stay healthy. Carr has proven to be one of the more injury-prone players for USC, but an injury at a crucial point of the season could be devastating for the Trojans.
Much like Kingsbury, Harrell has spent time working under the air-raid king and current Washington State head coach Mike Leach. Harrell’s experience with Leach led him to implement the pass-heavy offense at North Texas, and it worked like a charm. 
Harrell’s first season with the Mean Green in 2016 resulted in an abysmal 117th rank in total offense. Three years later, his offense finished at No. 20 in the nation for the same statistic. 
What’s most impressive is that Harrell managed to mount that statistic improvement while playing against “elite” teams like Incarnate Word and Liberty. That was obviously a joke. I recognize that his stats must be taken with a grain of salt, but a 97-place improvement has to turn some heads. 
As for USC’s passing game, it has weapons. Rising sophomore JT Daniels will be an all-star quarterback if he gets the proper coaching direction. That’s where Harrell comes in. The former NTU OC developed quarterback Mason Fine into Conference USA’s Offensive Player of the Year in 2017 and 2018. 
Daniels is surrounded by a wealth of receivers in rising sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown, senior Michael Pittman and redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns. I have no doubt that given the right guidance from a coach who has air-raid offense down to a science and the ability to develop quarterbacks, Daniels and his teammates will thrive in 2019.
USC’s defense is another concern. Losing senior captains in linebackers Cam Smith, Porter Gustin, cornerback Ajene Harris and safety Marvell Tell III is not an easy blow to recover from. But if I had to choose one USC coach to put all my faith in, it would be defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast. 
I don’t doubt that Pendergast will find a core of young talent in rising sophomores cornerback Olaijah Griffin, lineman Jay Tufele and safety Talanoa Hufanga to lead the defense in August. But even if he doesn’t, and the defense becomes a major flaw in USC’s playbook, an air-raid offense is the perfect remedy. Having the ability to get the ball down the field and into the end zone fast could prove to be invaluable, and it would mitigate some of the growing pains the defense could experience this year.
Harrell was hired on Wednesday and will have to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible to start working with the Trojans. National Signing Day is Feb. 6, and spring practices start in March. 
For Trojan fans, there is finally some hope for the 2019 football season.

As everyone knows, figuring out what to wear and how to maintain your personal style as a college student can be extremely difficult, from the limited dorm closet space that we all inevitably get as freshmen, to the difficulty that comes with the realization that you may have to leave some of your favorite pieces at home. If you’re unlucky enough to have an 8 a.m. class like I am, deciding on an outfit that complements your personal style is simply impossible when you wake up 10 minutes before class starts. And that’s not to mention the agony of finding the time and money to purchase trendy clothing on a college student’s budget. 
However, I’ve found that the most efficient way to dress in college is to find basic pieces that can be styled with pretty much anything. For me, this means a go-to white T-shirt and a trusty pair of jeans. Other great basics to have at your disposal are blazers, jean jackets, black dresses, leggings and leather jackets. These basics can help alleviate the stress of finding something to wear quickly and save closet space because they can be styled in so many different ways. 
Wardrobe basics always sounded great to me except for the obvious question: Where do I find high-quality basics? I’ve decided to share some of my favorite stores that have helped shape my college wardrobe. 
It can be hard to spend a lot of money on a single item, but I’ve found some stores whose products are long-lasting and affordable. First, one of my all-time favorite stores is Madewell; its relaxed styles, along its basics, are some of my essentials every time I shop. I prefer this brand when it comes to jeans and classic T-shirts that provide the best and most comfortable look. 
For trendier pieces, I tend to favor stores like Zara or Topshop. These are perfect when searching for an edgier look that’s quick and inexpensive. I also tend to use these stores to buy quirky accessories to complement the basics that I have established in my closet. Buying on-trend accessories is a great alternative to buying full pieces because it allows me to save money and space for classic pieces that I’ll get more use out of. 
Although I do love shopping at fast fashion stores like Zara, I am also working on being more environmentally conscientious as a consumer. I have recently come to love products from environmentally sustainable brands and have become more prone to spending more on a product that is sustainable. My favorite sustainable brands so far are Reformation for basics like jeans, T-shirt dresses and even some occasion dresses, and Everlane for T-shirts and shoes (their day heels are the most comfortable heels you’ll ever wear).
I’ve come to love these brands not only because of their ethical production and values, but also because I’ve found some of my favorite basic pieces, season after season, from these labels. I am shopping these brands year-round for my new favorite piece, and I feel comfortable spending more for higher quality pieces because I know they will be a better value and last much longer.
As someone who loves to shop, I am always happy when I find a store I can depend on for reliable and on-trend products that elevate my personal style. Being a college student has definitely tested my ability to maintain my style and love for fashion on top of all my other responsibilities, but I have found that these brands allow me to still enjoy fashion while streamlining the process of buying and wearing different styles.
Above all, I love the capacity of these brands and stores to build an entire wardrobe perfect for a busy college student that still wants to have a unique personal style.

New shows are flooding the podcast industry on a daily basis, and the comedy genre is no exception. Since comedy is rooted in great writing and joke delivery, podcasting is a perfect medium for the genre. 
Podcasts have quickly become a rite of passage for comedians. Finding the true gems among a sea of shows means going beyond the podcasts coming from popular celebrities, such as the veteran show “WTF with Marc Maron” or the newly debuted “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” (both of which are unequivocally great shows). Instead, these four shows are ones that probably won’t ever be featured on Apple Podcasts’ homepage — their humor bucks the mainstream with highly engaging, original content. Listening to any of the following podcasts is sure to brighten your day with an hour of comedy gold. 

Dr. Gameshow
Comedy podcast network Earwolf has no shortage of hilarious content, but one show that is often overlooked in its catalogue is the inimitable “Dr. Gameshow.” Small-time comedians Jo Firestone and Manolo Moreno host the show, and their contrasting personalities bring the podcast to life. Moreno’s self-deprecating, gloomy attitude is reminiscent of Eeyore from “Winnie the Pooh,” while Firestone boasts a quirky, devil-may-care disposition. 
Each week, the hosts play listener-submitted games, usually with call-in contestants and a guest comedian. The games always verge on absurdity, but that makes them all the more enjoyable. Examples include “Werewolf Elton John,” where contestants are asked to sing Elton John songs while slowly turning into werewolves, and “Alaska? I’ll Ask Her,” where contestants guess whether or not a town name is a fictional or real city in Alaska. 
The show’s devoted fanbase is as much a mainstay as the hosts — the podcast, by its nature, involves listeners at every opportunity. Their irreverent interactions with the hosts are as hilarious as the hosts themselves, and the hosts’ choice to allow listeners to take the reins of the show at times makes it a uniquely community-oriented podcast. Though Earwolf sadly canceled the show at the end of 2018, its archive features 63 full-length episodes. 
DELETE THIS!
From WNYC, this social media podcast offers perceptive commentary on the digital age through a omedic lens. Its hosts are popular YouTuber Hank Green of “vlogbrothers” fame, who has over 790,000 followers on Twitter, and his social media-averse wife Katherine. Green is a frequent Twitter user, and on “DELETE THIS!” he reviews each of his oft-misguided tweets with Katherine’s help. Green always realizes how his passion for a topic in the moment can cause him to tweet something he regrets later, and his wife makes him delete at least one tweet each week. 
“DELETE THIS!” offers a critical look into how we can tailor social media to our own needs, rather than succumbing to algorithms designed to keep us using social networks as often as possible. This nuanced examination of the internet age doesn’t prevent the show from being exceedingly humorous, however. The couple has such natural chemistry, and neither is afraid to speak candidly about their lives and relationship. Together, they become a comedy duo that makes you laugh out loud while being endearing and heartwarming at the same time.

Off-Book
Another offering from Earwolf, “Off-Book: The Improvised Musical” is an adventurous delight. Improv is a genre that wonderfully adapts itself to the podcasting medium. Through sound effects and great acting, podcasts create expansive, imaginative worlds without worrying about the lack of visuals. “Off-Book” takes full advantage of this. 
Hosts Zach Reino and Jess McKenna are experienced improvisers from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. On top of this, they are impressive singers and voice actors, which allows them to create characters in many different voice registers and improvise songs from almost any genre. The musicals the two create each week are impressive in their range and creativity, and while the plots and songs are imperfect due to their on-the-spot nature, the catchiest tunes will often stick, and the stories take on thematic elements that deepen their quality. 
The best comedy moments come when Reino and McKenna don’t try to act like they are performing a real, developed musical — the cracks in the stories and the hosts’ hasty attempts to cover them up are just as funny as the punchlines themselves. For theater nerds and comedy lovers alike, putting on an “Off-Book” episode means an hour of nonstop fun. 

Wooden Overcoats
This British sitcom sets itself up for success with an uncanny, darkly humorous premise: On a small island in the English Channel, Rudyard Funn lives comfortably as the isle’s only funeral director — until rival Eric Chapman moves to town and sets up another funeral home just across the street. The two begin to rejoice over every death the island sees, and compete for the affection (and business) of the deceased’s family. This storyline proves to be absurd when the show’s narrator is revealed to be a mouse who fancies herself as a budding journalist, documenting the funeral directors’ travails. 
As the series progresses over three seasons, listeners become increasingly invested in the show’s wide cast of recurring characters, including Rudyard’s sister, Antigone, who displays nihilistic tendencies and a deep obsession with embalming fluids, and the town’s mayor, Desmond Desmond, whose frustrating and bumbling idiocy creates amusing situations for the two funeral directors to navigate. Unlike podcast genres like true crime and interview shows that have become discouragingly oversaturated, the audio drama market is wide open. “Wooden Overcoats” follows in the footsteps of other fictional podcasts like “Welcome to Night Vale” and “The Truth” to produce one of the strongest offerings the genre has to date.

The Los Angeles Times screening of “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” welcomed five key creatives to discuss the film’s production with Times subscribers Wednesday at The Montalbán.  After the movie, Times senior writer Jeffrey Fleishman held a Q&A session with writer Phil Lord, producer Christopher Miller and directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman in front of an audience of nearly 800. 
Lord and Miller have operated as a filmmaking duo since their days as classmates at Dartmouth College. Some of their previous collaborations include “21 Jump Street,” “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” and “The Lego Movie.” Ramsey made his feature-length directorial debut with the “Rise of the Guardians” in 2012. For Persichetti and Rothman, “Into the Spider-Verse” was their directorial debut. 
Fleishman kicked off the conversation by asking Lord and Miller about the film’s beginnings. According to Lord, Sony executives approached the pair four years ago with a proposal to write and direct an animated Spider-Man movie. 
The two had one request: The film would center around Miles Morales. Morales, an Afro-Latino teenager from New York, first appeared in the Ultimate Fallout series in 2011. The pair believed Morales would be fitting as an updated version of the relatable Peter Parker character that inspired them to make the film in the first place.
“The idea of a superhero who’s like us, who’s an ordinary person who does extraordinary things, is powerful,” Lord said. “Before him, superheroes were gods, billionaires, people who came down to save us. Peter Parker — he’s somebody who was just like us and had to learn to save himself and save others.”
Rothman said he wanted to make a superhero movie that was both organic and realistic. To do this, he made sure to focus on the many different relationships that shape Morales’ character, particularly his family and the various versions of Spider-Man from alternate universes. 
“It was a just a series of encounters in his life that had different life experiences and represented a wide swatch of culture, race and sex,” Rothman said. “But really, it was just about trying to show through this diversity that we all have something in common.”
Rothman originally planned to include more friction and bickering between characters in the film, but in the midst of production, he found the film worked better with a friendlier dynamic.
“The movie works better when the characters kind of like each other,” he said. “Once we started to make the movie a little bit more open-hearted, then it just started to work better.”
To wrap up the conversation, Ramsey and Rothman stressed the importance of imperfection in screenwriting and filmmaking. They said that a good scene shouldn’t feel like the viewer is consuming a work of art; rather, they should feel like they’re witnessing an organic interaction between two people.
“Sometimes we don’t have to have the perfect line here if we can isolate the emotion,” Rothman said. “Sometimes people just don’t have the right words.”

From the day students set foot on campus, USC instills in them the importance of using education for the greater good. Regardless of major, students are encouraged to be community-minded individuals and use their privileges to assist those in need.
The Keck School of Medicine’s new Office of Social Justice is a refreshing reaffirmation of the University’s commitment to social responsibility and community service. In establishing this program, Keck reminds students that they must uphold the duty to apply their knowledge to better the world around them.
At a school nestled in the heart of Los Angeles, USC students are uniquely situated to observe the issues that Angelenos face first-hand and find ways to mitigate these problems. Health-related social justice issues like accessible health care have long plagued L.A. and the broader U.S. The Office of Social Justice aims to help students directly impact surrounding communities through initiatives centered on these issues. 
The Office of Social Justice will focus in particular on the South and East L.A. communities, both of which are underserved in the health sector. 
Keck already provides health services targeting health care accessibility issues in these communities, such as the Keck Human Rights Clinic, which provides medical and psychological evaluations to asylum-seeking survivors of human rights abuses. However, the creation of the Office of Social Justice formalizes Keck’s dedication to achieving social justice. By doing so, Keck ensures that these social justice initiatives continue to be prioritized within the school. 
On a larger scale, integrating social justice with health care will provide much-needed reform in the medical field. Racism in the health care industry has been proven to compromise medical treatment of black women — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black mothers are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications than white mothers.  
This illustrates the need to establish programs like the Office for Social Justice at Keck and medical centers so that it can ensure more responsible medical practices. 
As a fairly new program, the Office will undoubtedly face many hurdles as it finds its role within Keck. However, the school has proven its willingness to accept feedback and adapt accordingly. 
Newly appointed associate dean of the Office of Social Justice Ricky Bluthenthal will launch a listening tour, in which he plans to discuss expectations and intentions for the new office with Keck students, staff and other  community members and leaders. This tour demonstrates a commitment to respecting a variety of input, especially student voices, during this process of constructing the Office’s future plans. 
Keck’s establishment of the Office of Social Justice is a positive step toward recognition of the needs of the community. Though USC is often criticized for not being mindful of the surrounding L.A. community, the Office of Social Justice is proof that USC is recommitting to its core values of service and social responsibility.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will begin piloting a new drop-in advising program next week where students can meet with advisors without making appointments. 
The Dornsife Express Advising Service will allow students to talk with advisers every Thursday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at the Grace Ford Salvatori Hall for questions regarding topics like foreign language requirements, STARS reports and majors or minors. 
The current advising policy at Dornsife requires students to sign up for 30-minute appointments to meet with an adviser in person, according to Dornsife academic adviser Lila Mendoza , who proposed the new program. 
Since Dornsife is the largest school at USC, she said it can be difficult for students to schedule appointments or have their emails answered in a timely manner. She suggested the drop-in advising program last semester to help students get simple questions answered quickly without taking appointments away from other students who need them for mandatory advisement or more complicated questions. 
“For the students who have those quick 10-minute questions, they take up those 30-minute sessions that we could be using to meet with the students who have bigger questions regarding their schedule,” Mendoza said. “Maybe they didn’t pass a course, and we really need those 30 minutes to get to the nitty gritty stuff.” 
Viannda Hawkins, the associate director of advising for Dornsife, said students often have to email their advisers with questions if they can’t sign up for a 30-minute appointment, which can lead to miscommunication or delayed responses. She said the Express Advising Service will allow students to get their questions answered more efficiently. 
“I also feel that oftentimes with emails, there’s always a chance of misinterpretation and [the question] not being completely understood versus face-to-face you can explain the information,” Hawkins said. “The student can ask more follow-up questions, and an adviser can ask follow-up questions, and then we can determine what is the best course of action.” 
Hawkins said if a question cannot be answered in drop-in advising, the student will be referred to their personal adviser. 
Antonia Le, a freshman majoring in applied  and computational mathematics, said she hopes the program will eventually add more sessions throughout the week, so more students can participate. 
“The timing of [the Express Advising Service] is not great for everyone, so I feel that if it were offered on more days or if it went for a longer time on Thursdays, then more people could take advantage of what looks like a really good opportunity,” Le said. 
Hawkins said the advising office will track the number of students who participate and the types of questions they ask, so they can make improvements. Participating advisers will also be able to give feedback on the program.

The Undergraduate Student Government held its first-ever Senate Forum at Grace Salvatori Hall Thursday. The event gave student voters the opportunity to learn more about the 11 senatorial tickets running for office. 
According to USG bylaws, Senate candidates may run individually or in a group. Tickets with two or three candidates can campaign together on similar platform points, but each candidate is ultimately still competing against the others to be one of the 12 USG senators. During the voting period, a total of 20 candidates will be listed on the ballots individually. Only one incumbent candidate, sophomore Gabriel Savage, is running for re-election.
After each ticket introduced its platform at the forum, audience members asked questions and clarified legislation propositions before moving on to the next candidates.
The tickets discussed topics like mental health treatment funding and sustainability, as well as transparency and accountability with USG and the University administration.
The forum was moderated by juniors Rosa Wang and Montana Houston. Houston emphasized the importance of USG introducing the event.
“This forum is very instrumental in helping students make a decision because this allows students the opportunity to ask their questions directly,” Houston told the Daily Trojan after the forum. “[The candidates’] platform points on the [USG] website are pretty vague, so this is a great opportunity to get some elaboration on their points.” 
Many of the tickets addressed the connection between USG and the student body. Sophomores Hailey Robertson and Ben Rosenthal and freshman Julian Kuffour, who are running on a ticket together, spoke about the need for communication between USG and the undergraduate population.
“There’s a large disconnect between what people who are not in USG think about the school, what people in USG think and then what the administration does as a result of that,” Rosenthal said. 
Senate candidate Quinn Cunniff, a sophomore majoring in accounting, seeks to make changes in USG’s structure to increase accountability.
“Corruption ends with transparency, and I will provide that,” Cunniff said. 
Cunniff is skeptical about USG’s ability to perform in a transparent manner, and wants to represent students who think similarly.
“I think that I translate a lot of the sentiment of what the students feel like,” Cunniff said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There’s a reason turnout is so low. It’s because people don’t have … faith in the student government.” 
Sara Tamadon, a sophomore majoring in social sciences, said some audience members thought the forum could have been a longer event. 
“It’s really unfortunate that [the candidates] didn’t have enough time … some of the candidates were rushed,” Tamadon said. “They were definitely all well-prepared. I felt I had a good solid sense of all of the [candidates] who came to speak. I now feel like I have a better idea of who I’m going to vote for.”

The Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs is kicking off Black History Month Friday evening with F.R.O. Fest, which stands for “Films Reflecting Ourselves.” The festival is the second annual student film screening hosted by CBCSA at the Fisher Museum of Art. 
The theme of this year’s festival is “defining blackness.” CBCSA Assistant Director Theo Fowles said he created the festival last year in honor of the center’s 40th anniversary. 
“As a [School of Cinematic Arts] alum, I thought [F.R.O. Fest] would be an amazing opportunity for us to highlight … students of color, specifically black students that were writing, directing and producing here on campus,” Fowles said. 
Fowles said CBCSA received 12 film submissions this year. Six films spanning a variety of topics from gang rivalries to online dating were named “official selections,” and four other films received honorable mentions. Following a presentation of the six films, audience members will have an opportunity to hear from the creators in a panel discussion hosted by two students. 
Rhayme Spencer, a senior majoring in theatre, will be one of the co-hosts, along with Saphia Jackson, a senior majoring in public policy. Spencer, who is pursuing a cinematic arts minor, said he asked to host after Fowles approached him for help with the festival. 
“We will have one representative from each film to talk about the process and how much work and dedication … went into every single project,” Spencer said. “[We want to] open … a dialogue between creators and the audience.” 
Spencer said he also helped select this year’s films, which cover a variety of styles, from feature-length shorts to music videos. He said he thinks the festival is an important platform for black creators to see their work recognized, especially during awards season.
“It’s always nice to see people of color on screen doing literally anything,” Spencer said. “I think it’s nice to have this festival, so people who show up and watch these films can relate to something.” 
Jabree Webber, a third-year graduate student studying cinematic arts, film and television production, is one of this year’s filmmakers. Her film, “It Happened One Night,” follows the story of a woman who has been sexually assaulted in a future where Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case, has been overturned. 
Webber said she was inspired to make the film after she heard about sexual misconduct allegations against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. She said she set a budget of $2,500 for the film because that was the minimum amount allocated to former patients of Tyndall’s in the University’s $215 million settlement last October. 
“Having learned recently about all the allegations, I felt charged to continue the conversation and raise awareness about sexual assault,” Webber said. “In the film, it sort of explores how she is offered a settlement as well, and she has to grapple with taking it as a way to … erase the damage that has been done to her.” 
Webber, who produced, wrote and directed her film, spoke about the importance of including a story of sexual assault in this year’s lineup.
“As a black woman, I feel like we are often not included in the conversation when it comes to assault,” Webber said. “I really think that this film is important to include … It shows us being vulnerable.” 
Brianna Devons, a junior majoring in communication, co-wrote and directed a music video to “Fireworks in Tha Hood,” a 2015 song by singer and rapper Ventage about her experience growing up in Inglewood. The short film explores the rivalry between the Bloods and Crips gangs, set in a hunter-gatherer-like society in the woods. 
“I felt like her message [was] so powerful that it needed a visual component to it,” Devons said. 
Devons, who is currently in Rome and unable to attend the festival, said she hopes F.R.O. Fest will bring the USC community together. 
“I feel like at USC … there’s a secondary space for the black community,” Devons said. “Hopefully the people that attend the festival will not just be black people, but people that are interested in hearing these stories.” 
Fowles said the festival received an increased number of submissions from last year, and he hopes F.R.O. Fest continues to grow. He said next year, submissions may open up to recent alumni in addition to current students. 
“What I want people to consistently get … through F.R.O. Fest is that blackness looks different ways to different people,” Fowles said. “It’s oftentimes what people don’t expect it to be … so I wanted to be able to highlight those stories … through film.” 
This story is part of the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.

The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission decided the Michaela & Meagan presidential ticket did not violate the Elections Code after holding a hearing Monday, according to the Elections Code infraction decision. The vote was unanimous.
Allegra Gutierrez, USG assistant director of graphics, filed the complaint against vice presidential candidate Meagan Lane. According to the infraction decision, she claimed presidential candidate Michaela Murphy and Lane “knowingly posted on their website” that students can visit them in the USG office for more information about their campaign. 
This allegedly violated Article XIII in the USG Elections Code. According to Elections Code XIII.A.2., “No campaign planning or related activities may occur within the USG office.” According to Senior Director of Communications Fern Leon-Ramos, the USG office is meant to be a non-partisan space, so no campaign-related discussion should be held in the office. 
Murphy described the incident as an “oversight on our part,” and said the information was online for no more than 24 hours.
“When we were setting up the website, … you have to put in your place of business,” Murphy said. “We had just listed TCC 224 [the USG office] because that was an address that we could use. It wound up popping up on our contact page. Before it was brought to our attention, we didn’t realize that it could be interpreted as us encouraging students to come to the USG office during our senatorial office hours to talk to us about campaign-related discussion, which is absolutely something neither of us would have encouraged.” 
According to Leon-Ramos, Lane had Sen. Manda Bwerevu stand as her witness at the hearing. Bwerevu supported Lane and affirmed that no one came into the USG office to talk to Murphy and Lane about their campaign. 
Therefore, since the Elections Commission found that a violation of the Elections Code had not occurred, the commission unanimously voted to not impose sanctions on the Michaela & Meagan presidential ticket. 
“It was just a mistake on [Murphy and Lane’s] end, but it only happened digitally,” Leon-Ramos said. “No one actually followed through, and they didn’t actually end up talking about their campaign in their office. They were asked to take it off the website, and it was already taken off the website at that point.” 
Allegra Gutierrez did not respond to request for comment by time of publication.
