With under four minutes left in the fourth quarter, there wasn’t much left to see for the fans at the Coliseum who sweated through the entirety of USC’s win over Western Michigan on Saturday.
Junior safety Marvell Tell III had just scored USC’s seventh touchdown of the game on a pick-six to put the Trojans ahead of Western Michigan 48-31, and fans started heading for the exits.
But before freshman placekicker Chase McGrath kicked the final extra point, head coach Clay Helton curiously called a timeout. Then, he yelled at redshirt sophomore long snapper Jake Olson.
“Are you ready?” Helton asked. “Let’s get this done.”
Fans who wanted to beat the traffic stayed in their seats. Media members who just wanted the game to end perked both ears up. The announcers on the Pac-12 Network started giving background on Olson. His name was introduced over the public-address system to the roar of the crowd. Slowly, the realization of what was about to happen drifted through the Coliseum: A blind man was about to participate in a real, live college football game.
Olson took a few practice snaps with redshirt junior placeholder Wyatt Schmidt, and then he was out there. On the field. In a game. Next thing he knew, he was lined up, the whistle had blown and it was “go time.” He didn’t even have time to be nervous.
“Wyatt told me to put my hands on the ball and called the cadence right away,” Olson said. “There wasn’t much time to think about anything.”
Of course, the snap was perfect. Of course, the kick was good. And in the ensuing hours and days, Olson’s moment of a lifetime has gone viral, making the rounds on social media and earning him airtime on ESPN and an interview with The New York Times.
“What a pressure player,” Helton said. “Was that not a perfect snap? I’m very proud of him. He’s put a ton of work in.”
To fully understand the gravity of that snap, you need to know what Olson went through to get to that moment. How he was diagnosed with retinoblastoma — a cancer of the retina — at birth, causing him to lose his left eye at 10 months. How the cancer came back eight separate times despite rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and other treatment. How, at age 12, his right eye was removed to prevent the cancer from spreading to the brain, rendering him completely blind.
But the die-hard USC fan from Huntington Beach was determined to not just live while blind, but also accomplish his dream: wear the Cardinal and Gold on Saturdays. So he learned how to long-snap, perfecting the position over a summer in high school.
“When I first started I couldn’t snap the ball,” Olson told the Daily Trojan in 2015. “I didn’t know what the heck I was doing. It took two or three months of really practicing hard to start seeing some progress.”
Remarkably, he progressed enough to earn the starting long snapper position at Orange Lutheran, a football powerhouse in Orange County. And soon, he not only found himself at USC through a scholarship with Swim With Mike, an organization that helps physically challenged athletes attend college, but he also made the football team.
He redshirted his first season, spending time on the practice field working on his snaps. And in one practice in fall of 2015, then-head coach Steve Sarkisian told Olson to jump in and snap the ball in a live field goal drill for the first time.
“I felt ready,” Olson said. “It was something I did thousands of times. It was not letting the situation get in your head … Just do the same thing you always do.”
Perhaps as a precursor to his first snap in a live game, that attempt was also perfect — as if there was ever any doubt. On Saturday, his family was in attendance, and they were probably more nervous than he was.
“I didn’t want them to put him in when the game was so close because I didn’t want that pressure for him, even though I’m sure he would’ve done fine,” said Jake’s mother, Cindy, standing outside the USC locker room following the game.
She was quick to add that she was speaking for herself and not her son, who does not lack any confidence. A few weeks ago, Olson was with his family in Atlanta across from the College Football Hall of Fame and the city where the National Championship Game will be played next January, for a speaking engagement, and officials offered to give him a tour. But Olson declined.
“I’m coming back in January with my team,” Olson said, according to his mother. “That’s when we’re going to do it.”
But Olson also has a sense of humility and appreciation for the opportunities he’s received. It took a concerted effort to set up Saturday’s moment, with Helton reaching out to Western Michigan head coach Tim Lester before the game, offering to not rush the Broncos’ first extra point attempt if Lester would tell his players to back off during Olson’s snap. Lester agreed.
“I told my guys, ‘This opportunity for Jake is bigger than the game, you know?’” Lester told USA TODAY.
Indeed, the moment was bigger than sports. On the scoreboard, it was merely a point — but for Olson, it was a dream come true. On Saturday, he showed that blindness can’t stop him from doing what he loves. From celebrating with his teammates on the field to being interviewed in the press conference room, Olson was treated to the full college football experience — not just as a 12-year-old when he spent a day with former head coach Pete Carroll and the football team before his surgery, but as an actual player on the official USC roster.  
“This has come full circle because he got up there being on the team and actually contributing to his team,” Cindy Olson said.
We probably haven’t seen the last of Olson yet, as Helton said he would try to work him into more games. Regardless, Olson has already done without eyesight what most of others haven’t done with vision.
And on Saturday, instead of reporters peppering redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold with questions in the postgame press conference room, it was Olson who answered question after question — on getting the opportunity to play, on the emotions of walking on the field, on what surprised him and on his life coming full-circle. One-by-one, he gave thought-out, elaborate answers, but it was his last answer — the one in response to coming full-circle — that drew nods from Helton and junior running back Ronald Jones II and sucked the air out of the packed room.  
“I just think there’s a beauty in it,” he said. “If you can’t see how God works things out, then I think you’re the blind one.”

The last two matches for the women’s soccer team could best be described as a roller coaster. The No. 12 Trojans split their two games over the weekend, topping Missouri and falling to Kansas.
On Friday, the Trojans started their road trip in Columbia, Mo. facing off against the Tigers. Going into the game, the Trojans knew they needed to apply pressure for the entirety of the game, establish their back line and capitalize on scoring opportunities. 
The first half was a struggle for the Trojans. Going up against a makeshift defense — as a result of four Mizzou injuries — USC may have been expected to dominate against the Tigers early on. However, two substantial missed scoring opportunities resulted in a scoreless first half. 
Although the Trojans missed opportunities on offense, they were able to establish a reliable defense and limit Mizzou to four shots on net. The Tigers were left scoreless in the first half thanks to a magnificent diving save by redshirt freshman Kaylie Collins and a goal line stop on a corner kick by sophomore defender Julia Bingham.
In the second half, the Trojans came out strong. Thirty seconds in, freshman forward Tara McKeown found the back of the net on a cross from redshirt junior midfielder Sydney Myers to give the Trojans the lead. 
After taking the lead, the Trojans did not take their feet off the pedal. Eight minutes later, the team struck again as freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo put away a cross from fellow freshman Tara McKeown. The Trojans’ goals marked both McKeown’s and DeMelo’s first scores in Cardinal and Gold.
The second half saw a dominant USC performance. But head coach Keidane McAlpine was still not satisfied with the way his team played. 
“It was not our best performance, but it was good to get a result tonight on the road,” McAlpine said. “We hope to get better as we head into our game on Sunday at Kansas.”
If USC wants to continue to win, it must demonstrate intensity from minute one until minute 90. McAlpine and company knew that as they headed to Kansas to battle the Jayhawks. 
USC’s gameplay against the Jayhawks was surprisingly similar to its performance against the Tigers a couple of days prior — a lackluster first half followed by a roaring second half on offense. Unfortunately for the Trojans, this time they weren’t so lucky, as Kansas went up early with a goal from sophomore forward Katie McClure in the 13th minute. 
Moving into the second half, the Trojans managed to put shots on net and create scoring opportunities, but were met with resistance. In the 69th minute, the Trojans played a ball back to keeper Kaylie Collins, who was unable to field the pass. The ball bounced into the Trojans’ net to put the Jayhawks up by 2. 
In the 74th minute, Trojans redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony capitalized on a penalty kick to halve KU’s lead. The Trojans outshot the Jayhawks 13-6, five of which came from Anthony. Nonetheless, they were unable convert on their scoring opportunities to tie the score and fell to Kansas 2-1. 
“I was very disappointed with our performance in the first half,” McAlpine said. “We did not bring enough energy to compete in a game of this magnitude. We played a better second half, but when you give away 45 minutes to a good team, you don’t give yourself the best chance to win, and that’s the lesson that we learned tonight.”
This game means a lot for the No. 7 Trojans, as a loss to an unranked Kansas will likely drop them in the rankings. The Trojans concluded their road trip in Kansas and return to Los Angeles to prepare for a two-game stretch against Santa Clara and Iowa State.

The No. 19 USC women’s volleyball team went 1-2 at the Bluejay Invitational this past weekend at Creighton University. Each of the four teams participating in the invitational entered undefeated, and they all suffered at least one loss during the weekend. The invitational tournament dropped the Trojans’ overall season record to 4-2.
After starting the season unranked for the first time since the AVCA polls began, USC came out with a chip on its shoulders and went undefeated through its first tournament. That performance earned the team a No. 18 ranking in the poll the following week. 
The Trojans opened their weekend against Northern Iowa. It took four sets — three going into extra points — for the Panthers to top the Trojans (26-24, 30-28, 17-25, 26-24). 
The loss against Northern Iowa was the first time USC lost to one of the opponents — UNI, Kentucky and Creighton — in the four-year run of the Bluejay Invitational. 
Senior opposite Brittany Abercrombie recorded 16 kills,  the most on the team, which matched her career high. She also swung a .520 hitting percentage, her career best. 
Despite the Trojans out-serving (six to three aces), out-blocking (13.5 to 8.0) and out-hitting (.235 to .196) the Panthers, UNI took advantage of USC’s errors and scored critical points late in sets to take the match. The two stayed even throughout the majority of the match, with the score tied 41 times throughout. 
Junior libero Victoria Garrick recorded a career-high 27 digs and sophomore setter Cindy Marina recorded her second double-double of the season. 
The next day, USC came out and surprised its host, No. 7 Creighton, by sweeping the Bluejays (26-24, 25-16, 25-18). It was the Trojans’ first sweep of the season. 
Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier led everyone with a 23-kill performance. She hit .476 and recorded an ace. As a team, USC out-hit Creighton .353 to .204. It was the fourth plus-.350 hitting performance for USC in five matches. The Trojans dominated the Bluejays, recording 54 kills to their 34. 
Later that day, USC faced off against No. 13 Kentucky. The Wildcats bested the Trojans in four sets (25-16, 11-25, 25-19, 25-19). While the first two matches of the invitational featured a number of tied scores, none of the sets against the Wildcats was closely contested. In USC’s one win, the Trojans broke away early, holding off Kentucky to merely 11 points. For the first time this season, USC lost sets by more than two points. On a positive note for USC, the team only committed 16 errors to UK’s 20 errors. 
Lanier led the team with 15 kills and two aces. Senior opposite Niki Withers put up her own career-high .476 hitting percentage. Withers recorded 13 kills, second- most for the team. Abercrombie recorded 10 kills and two blocks. Garrick notched another career high, this time with seven assists. 
The Trojans now look to add more wins to their record as they head north to Santa Barbara to face Arkansas, UC Santa Barbara and Yale at the UCSB Thunderdome Classic this weekend.

After a 49-31 win over Western Michigan in a blistering Coliseum on Saturday, USC shifted its focus to beating Stanford on Tuesday. In his post-practice press conference, head coach Clay Helton praised the upcoming opponent. 
“Having a chance to watch them the past few days, it’s the same thing as usual,” Helton said. “It’s a very well-disciplined, very physical team under [head coach] David Shaw.” 
The Trojans’ first Pac-12 game will be a big test and will tell a lot about where the team stands at the moment. 
Darnold looks to bounce back
In what was hyped up to be the beginning of redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s Heisman campaign, the quarterback had what he considered a bad day. While Darnold threw for 289 yards, he also threw two interceptions.
“I think my emotions kind of got the best of me there,” Darnold said. “I thought I made the right decisions but I just need to put the ball in a better placement.” 
While Darnold wishes he had some throws back, he’s moved on, focusing on preparing for Stanford instead. 
“The thing I love about Sam Darnold is that he’s always so hard on himself,” Helton said. “He’s a perfectionist and wants to do better.”
Defense Looks to Step Up 
After receiving praise all spring and fall camp, USC’s defense struggled out of the gate. Helton cited mental mistakes that contributed to their poor defensive performance. 
“We had some alignment errors, lost gap control and then we missed a tackle or two out in space,” Helton said. “If you combine any of those three things, it’s going to make for a hard day, but we let all three of them happen.” 
Junior running back Bryce Love will lead the Stanford rushing attack, and USC’s defense must find answers after giving up 263 rushing yards to the Broncos. 
USC’s defense let its frustration spill over into Tuesday as a handful of scuffles broke out. Junior cornerback Isaiah Langley and redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns got into it after a whistle, and then later on redshirt freshman wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe mixed it up with sophomore cornerback Jack Jones.
“I know defensively they’re mad,” Helton said. “They’re ready to play. They have a pride about playing good physical football and that wasn’t them on Saturday.” 
After the extra pushing and shoving, Helton called his team to huddle up. 
“This field is about competition,” he said. “But I just wanted to remind them to make sure that we’re making good decisions in games and not a decision that will cost us 15 yards.” 
Repeat the Running Game 
After gaining 232 yards on the ground in the season opener, the Trojans look to continue their success running the ball. Junior running back Ronald Jones II led the group, but the coaching staff emphasized that the depth of the group is an asset. Freshman Stephen Carr broke off a long touchdown run in his USC debut, redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai was productive when he had the ball and the coaches also trust junior Aca’Cedric Ware. 
“We feel really good about having four running backs that we can hand the ball off,” Martin said. “They are a really close knit group. No one is mad about the other guy getting balls and reps. They’re all playing and we’re really happy about where we are at the running back position.” 
Rankings Slip 
The latest AP Rankings came out on Tuesday. The new rankings have the Trojans falling from No. 4 to No. 6 in the country. Stanford’s rank stayed at No. 14. 
Injury Report
After suffering a knee contusion in the first half against Western Michigan, junior offensive lineman Chuma Edoga fought through pain and finished the game. On Tuesday, he was limited in practice. Helton said he will most likely be available on Saturday, but won’t see the same number of snaps. 
Redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe played but was still a little banged up on Saturday. As he gets healthier, Helton says he will be integrated more into the passing game. 
Freshman safety Bubba Bolden is doubtful after injuring his knee on Saturday.

Veteran quarterback Philip Rivers dropping a pass into the awaiting arms of Travis Benjamin for a 45-yard touchdown was the concluding scene of the team’s opening drive against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 3 of the NFL preseason. That was exactly what Los Angeles Chargers fans want to see prior to the regular season opener.
Rivers completed all six of his passes for 85 yards, and defensive standouts Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram combined to suddenly thwart the Rams’ first drive. Bosa thumped the Rams’ presumed starter Jared Goff on the Chargers’ 8-yard line, forcing a fumble that Ingram picked up and returned the other way for a touchdown.
The last time the Rams consistently had good days was during the era of quarterback Kurt Warner. The Rams’ Aaron Donald and Todd Gurley are exciting to watch, but this Chargers group is particularly intriguing. If there’s ever been a time in the past decade to begin watching the Chargers, it’s now. Bosa, Ingram, Rivers and a group of promising youngsters feature as playmakers. 
This season will hint whether or not the Chargers have built well through recent drafts with the performances of tight end Hunter Henry and wide receivers Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and Tyrell Williams, as well as guards Dan Feeney and Forrest Lamp in 2017. The 2015 undrafted rookie Williams was a massive steal, as shown by his 1,000-plus receiving yards in 2016. Ingram and Bosa figure to be a scary duo for opposing offenses. Starting 11 games in 2016, running back Melvin Gordon provided San Diego with a strong, tough runner who helped take pressure off Rivers. It feels like this Chargers roster is closer than you would think to a playoff berth. 
But the results in the next few seasons are going to come down to what Rivers has left in the tank and how long he can keep playing. In three years or more, the Chargers could have a legitimate shot in the playoffs, but at age 35, Rivers is not getting any younger. Last season, he threw 21 interceptions, his highest total in his career. If the Chargers want to have any chance to make some noise in 2017, the North Carolina State legend needs to be near his best, which means he will have to further scrutinize his gunslinging mentality.
The Chargers’ defense proved itself against the run in 2016, ranking 10th in the league for total rushing yards allowed. The Bolts’ pass coverage definitely has room to improve, although a strong pass rush covered some of its weaknesses. 
Yes, the Chargers aren’t built to win now, and their inability to seal a postseason berth in January would be partially attributed to the competitiveness of the AFC West. The Oakland Raiders, with a healthy Derek Carr, are among the best teams in the AFC. Andy Reid has led the Kansas City Chiefs to the postseason three out of the four years he’s been head coach. The Denver Broncos don’t have a sure-fire difference-maker at quarterback, but you can usually count on their defense to carry a notable burden. Having to go against each of these teams, accounting for half of their entire schedule, puts the Chargers in arduous positions most weeks. 
The truly difficult regular season games for the Chargers will occur on the road, facing the New England Patriots and Dallas Cowboys. You never know when Rivers can get hot and pull off a show that takes down a top dog, but sometimes the weaker sides can outplay Rivers and co. That’s why the Bolts can’t afford to sleep on a home competition against the Cleveland Browns and an away game at Jacksonville.
New Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn has a rich history in coaching, particularly extensive time spent as a running backs coach. And there’s a possibility he can elevate Gordon’s game to the next level. The downside of Lynn’s resume is that he has very little head coaching experience, serving as the interim head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 2016 for one game after Rex Ryan’s firing, but his energy and understanding should mesh well with the players.
“This business is all about being a leader of men and getting guys to follow you,” former Chargers great LaDainian Tomlinson said in an interview with the Chargers’ website.  “A-Lynn certainly had that quality when he was my running backs coach.  And it helps that he played the game.  He knows what players go through, and he can relate to all of us.”
The Chargers open the regular season against the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. Lynn hopes to begin a spectacular journey that will be remembered for ages to come. More tangibly, perhaps the results in 2017 will mark the beginning of something special in Los Angeles.

If your USC party schedule doesn’t include a living room environment with live jazz and focused listening, it may be time for you to expand your horizons.
The Portland Street Sessions offer a different way to engage with music than typical party concerts around campus, creating a setting designed for guests to have increased interaction with the artists. 
Founder Zev Shearn-Nance, who graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music in May, said he got the idea for the concert series as soon as he moved into an off-campus house in 2016.
“It just occured to me that this space could be utilized really well for this concert concept,” Shearn-Nance said. “So I ran the idea by everybody and people seemed down, and over time more and more people started getting excited about it.”
That momentum has brought some amazing jazz musicians through Portland Street, such as Louis Cole, who has worked with Thundercat and opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the past. Grammy-winning artist Jacob Collier’s performance was especially notable; he played at the house for hours and then stayed to interact with the crowd.
“It was so lucky that we got him to perform here,” said Remi Wolf, a senior in the popular music program who runs the group’s various social media accounts. “The fact that he was down to do this house party in this relatively small space, it was just so awesome.”
On Friday, saxophonist Alex Hahn stopped by the Portland Street Sessions while touring for his upcoming album, Emerging. The album, which will be released on Friday, includes classical and cinematic influences, adding new layers to the complex jazz harmonies. 
After Hahn impressed the audience with dynamic cuts from the album alongside his band, he noted how the venue’s intimate setting allowed for a more rewarding experience. 
“For the environment to be about listening, and about the music, that’s something that’s super special,” Hahn said. 
Hahn graduated from the Thornton School of Music in 2016, and is still plugged into the community of musicians at the school. He says his fellow students gave him significant growth in his artistry. 
“Everybody’s helping each other out, everybody just wants to play and learn … it was a great environment for me,” Hahn said. “Everybody was always so encouraging.”
Shearn-Nance and Hahn have played together in the past during their time at USC, and on Friday the party’s host hopped on the drums to back up his guest. This type of seamless collaboration is encouraged at the Portland Street Sessions, especially in the jam sessions that follow every performance. 
“Last time, there was a random guy who was walking down the street and just heard [us because] the windows were open and he was so stoked,” said Larry Scanniello, a senior majoring in pop music who lives at the house. “He came in and he was jamming, and he was a genuinely good bass player! He really could play.”
The Portland Street Sessions is entirely student-run, receiving no administrative or financial support from USC. It’s a nonprofit in the truest sense: Listeners don’t pay to get in, and artists aren’t paid to play. 
“As a musician myself, that’s really important to me,” Shearn-Nantz said. “I tend to not feel very good about performing for free when I know that concert promoter over there is making money, that doesn’t really make sense. But because no one is making money out of this enterprise … we’ve been able to have some incredible musicians who typically would get paid quite a lot to perform.”
For someone who isn’t as well-acquainted with jazz, Scanniello believes attending a live show is the best way to fall in love with the genre. 
“Seeing jazz live, it’s a totally different animal than listening to the recording,” Scanniello said. “You can see the communication between everybody … it’s just more intense because so much of it is improvised. It’s just that aspect, always wondering what’s going to happen next.”
Hahn pointed out the range of styles in the genre, ensuring there’s an artist out there for everyone. 
“Saying the word ‘jazz’ doesn’t mean a certain thing,” Hahn said. “There’s so much jazz out there, from Robert Glasper collaborating with hip-hop artists to Wynton Marsalis, who’s playing Dixieland tunes from the ’10s and the ’20s. I think that’s a big part of why jazz going forward, or really since it was created, has been so successful.”
The Portland Street Sessions take place twice a month, with a new performer slated for each night. Avant-jazz/post-rock group Hunter Gather will be taking the stage at the next show on Sept. 22, along with singer-songwriter Madison Douglas, a current pop music performance student at USC.

On a hot Monday afternoon, Rabbit Crew Coffee & Tea provides a nice refuge in downtown Los Angeles. The modern, trendy cafe is minimalistic in design and offers tons of natural light for visitors. Small succulents adorn the table tops next to books and laptops as people work, study and chat all the while consuming drinks and snacks to escape the heat awaiting them outside. 
Inside, the lush decor and natural theme are manifest in a picturesque moss wall, a perfect addition to any Instagram feed. The actual coffee bar is made of gray granite, white wood and glistening stainless steel appliances. The simplicity of the bar is matched by the no-fuss menu and contains coffees, teas and small appetizers for customers to order. A variety of cold and hot drinks are listed as well as an assortment of avocado toasts. For hot days, depending on one’s mood, it would be fitting to order Rabbit Crew’s cold brew, a strong, flavorful dark roast; or the matcha green tea iced latte, a refreshing thirst quencher. Looking throughout the cafe, the latte is a popular order. 
For those who have been searching for a boba place, Rabbit Crew is also a place to visit. Every drink comes with the option of adding boba for $1. The boba is just the right amount of soft, easy to eat but also chewy enough. 
A selection of avocado toasts awaits customers as part of Rabbit Crew’s brunch menu. The classic avocado toast consists of a piece of sourdough bread topped with sliced avocados, cherry tomatoes and chives, topped with a poached egg and finished with a sprinkle of peppercorn. The yolk runs smoothly across the piece of  toast once it is broken and makes for a nice addition that ties all the flavors together. The peppercorn adds a hint of spice to the otherwise creamy and sweet avocado toast. It is definitely one of the highlights of Rabbit Crew’s menu. 
Aside from the classic avocado toast, Rabbit Crew’s brunch menu also offers salmon and crab salad toasts. The salmon toast is accompanied by a bed of avocado, and garnished with tomatoes, pickled onions, sesame seeds and basil. It’s a particularly filling toast that is simultaneously spicy and sour. The crab salad toast is extremely decadent, made with heaps of blue crab and embellished with slices of cucumber, tomato, onions and a huge slice of avocado on top. The crab salad toast is definitely a must-try for those looking to treat themselves out.
The prices are reasonable and first-time customers get a discount, the perfect incentive for people who have yet to visit. In terms of convenience, Rabbit Crew is located right off Interstate 10, on South Santa Fe Avenue, a mere 10 minutes from campus and at the edge of the Arts District. 
Overall, Rabbit Crew has a warm, welcoming atmosphere, friendly baristas, reasonably good drinks and fantastic avocado toasts. It is yet another trendy coffee house people should add to their repertoire of L.A. coffee joints.

I don’t know why I volunteered to write this column, because I don’t do well with honesty. 
Some people find writing to be a cathartic experience, working out their trials and tribulations through the act of putting pen to paper, and then feel completely comfortable sharing this private slice of their mind with an audience of strangers. I am not one of those people. I don’t even like revealing my feelings in a one-on-one setting, much less letting my inner turmoil become a piece of performance art open for public consumption. 
Actually, I’m more the type to bottle, cork, stopper, tamp down any semblance of sentimentality until it’s buried so deep in the recesses of my consciousness that even I am incapable of accessing it, unless armed with a narcotic cocktail. Unhealthy? Perhaps. I forecast an emergency trip to the therapist for an emotional enema in my future. 
But I don’t want to give off the wrong impression here. I’m not some cold, unfeeling psychopath, incapable of empathy or affection. Au contraire: I feel often — and deeply. But you won’t find my heart on my sleeve; you’ll probably find it after fending off thorny hedges, crocodile-infested moats and a fire-breathing dragon. And no, no one hurt me. I’m merely taking preemptive measures to ensure that I won’t get hurt in the first place. 
Not to say that I shy away from displays of vulnerability, as long as they’re on someone else’s part. I pride myself on being a great listener, advice-dispenser and general go-to person for unloading an emotional burden. But as soon as the expectation of reciprocation arises, I’m dodging questions better than Neo dodging bullets. I’m a master at deflection, either by volleying the inquiry back, skirting the subject entirely or answering in a tone so saturated with sarcasm that no one could possibly take me seriously. When faced with a question loaded with any sort of significance or gravitas, my response is usually along the lines of, “Sorry I forgot to mention, but I’m headed to Havana tomorrow for three months.” 
Humor and irony are my tactical weapons, which, if you couldn’t tell, I’m deploying right here and now. Even my genuine statements are often coated with a thin layer of sardonicism, so that you can give me the benefit of the doubt, and I can retain plausible deniability. This dynamic has become so entrenched in my interactions that I’ve caught a searching side-eye directed my way and a skeptical smile lingering after I cast a simple “I like your shirt” toward a friend. 
So I guess that’s why I volunteered to write this column. I won’t lie and say that my relationships with friends and family haven’t suffered as a result of my inability to open up. I want to work on letting my guard down more easily. I don’t want to be forced to follow up with a “No, really, I’m serious” when I compliment someone’s clothing choice. Years down the line, I don’t want to regret keeping everyone I care about at arm’s length. 
Full disclosure: I was close to copping out and instead writing about my favorite books. Certainly, it would’ve been much easier than agonizing over this article, which was filled with false starts, second guesses and many (metaphorical) crumpled balls of paper tossed into the wastebasket. But no one wants to listen to me wax poetic about Infinite Jest; we are inherently curious about the misadventures, misgivings and misfortunes of others — if only to fulfill our daily schadenfreude quota. So who am I to deny the masses? 
Just one request: If you ever encounter me in real life, please, do us both a favor and pretend you never read this.

I don’t necessarily oppose the Los Angeles City Council’s replacement of Columbus Day with “Indigenous People’s Day” on the city calendar — I’ve always thought a “John Smith Day” or “John Winthrop Day” would be more appropriate of an American holiday, and the Italian Americans the holiday was originally meant to appease are now thoroughly integrated into American society — but I don’t really support the measure either. Let me explain.
Christopher Columbus was personally responsible for innumerable crimes against the Taino Indians of Santo Domingo. He enslaved and murdered countless numbers of them in his lust for gold and land. His fateful landing made possible the subsequent wars and plagues that killed millions of the Americas’ original inhabitants during the European conquest. It’s all true.
But do we also reject the sovereignty and right to exist of all the nations of the Americas, including the United States, because of the slaughter that led to their founding? Do we reject our own heritage — and the good it’s done — because it was watered with blood?
This moral complexity is important, and it is very hard to accept. The fact that the United States was founded upon the conquest of Native American territory, slavery and other human rights violations, doesn’t by any means justify these actions. However, it does mean that the legacy and heritage of the United States will forever be intertwined with the injustices which have always accompanied the human experience.
Because America is so hopelessly morally compromised, it could seem proper to reject loyalty and patriotism out of a concern for higher, loftier ends like justice and human rights, or at least to hide the crazy uncle in the attic, and root out any memorials dedicated to the worst excesses of American sins — to remove holidays and monuments honoring Christopher Columbus, Andrew Jackson, and Robert E. Lee.
Many come to that conclusion and have taken that second route of erasure, including the members of the Los Angeles City Council who voted for the replacement of Columbus Day. I’m not arguing that they shouldn’t value the rights and legacy of Native Americans and should not act on this. But I do worry about the unwillingness of many elements on the elite American left to accept the moral complexity of the American past, and of the human condition.
We at USC take as our mascot the name of the Trojans, a mythic people immortalized in Virgil’s Aeneid. The Trojans and their leader, Aeneas, epitomized the moral complexity of statecraft and history. They sailed from the ruins of Troy to the shores of Italy, and conquered it in a brutal war with the native Latins.
But the victorious Trojans would found the city that, so the legend goes, over the course of centuries would become the mighty Roman Republic, a political order that would bring order to the Mediterranean world. The American story’s dilemma is not as different as one might think.
I don’t know if the later Romans ever rejected the legacy of Aeneas for his crimes. But many Americans reject Columbus for his crimes — justifiably — but I would argue shortsightedly. The logic that rejects Christopher Columbus, Andrew Jackson, and Robert E. Lee need only go a little further to reject John Winthrop, Alexander Hamilton and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
I, for one, would rather accept the fraught nature of political morality. Alexander Hamilton had an interesting way of putting it: “’Tis the portion of man, assigned to him by the eternal allotment of Providence, that every good which he enjoys shall be alloyed with ills, that every source of his bliss shall be a source of his affliction.” 
Columbus committed great crimes and paved the way for greater crimes. But the political order that has arisen because of that has done untold good for its own citizens and for the world. So many of us, unlike Hamilton, spurn that moral complexity; perhaps that explains why we Americans are bad at this whole politics thing.

Well said.  
Total lunacy to attempt to wipe the slate of history clean.  
Anyone with any sense or knowledge of history knows how torn Robert E Lee was very torn with the decision he faced…his father was one of Washington’s generals, his family invested in making it a “united” states.  Context…State rights meant more than Federal rights.
In Columbus time there was different morals in play than today.  To cut off our legacy to them, to forget these lessons of history is to embark our culture to repeat them someday in the future…

There’s a few things that almost all public schoolchildren know. It was 1492 when Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue on the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. What they might not know is that Columbus’ actions propelled the genocide of millions of Native Americans — that his own writings reveal his motivations to seize gold and enslave those that he encountered. His subjugation led to the devastation and destruction of Native American communities that have now endured centuries of trauma. It ripped open one of the largest historical wounds in humanity. By any standard, it was deplorable.
So when the Los Angeles City Council changed Columbus Day to Indigenous People’s Day, it sent Angelenos an important message: We are better than our past, and we will strive to be better than our present. 
It amazes many that, given Columbus’ history and Los Angeles’ progressivism, it took so long for the city to stop its endorsed celebration of a man who perpetuated so much violence. 
Unfortunately, the move has been met by distaste by many who view it as yet another effort by the left to instill political correctness in everyday life. TheWall Street Journal  Editorial Board said of the move, “If we honored only saints, few would make it onto pedestal.” Yes, indeed — but that is the point of those whose names have become national days of celebration. The presence of Christopher Columbus among the only two other federal holidays named after historical leaders, Martin Luther King Jr. and George Washington, is an insult to our modern values.
It is true that many of the most instrumental figures in our nation’s history committed acts that are despicable by today’s standards. Many of our founding fathers owned slaves, like Thomas Jefferson — and, as a Smithsonian Magazine piece points out, “embraced the worst forms of racism to justify slavery.” Former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, beloved and revered for his New Deal programs, also signed the executive order to send over 100,000 Japanese Americans to internment camps. Even Aristotle thought Asiatic barbarians were naturally slavish. 
Yet, the recognition that some great leaders have also committed cardinal sins should not be a reason to keep the memorialization of these figures in place. It justifies the opposite. The renaming of Columbus Day is not an attempt to expunge the parts of history that run contrary to modern values. It is, instead, an attempt to correct the revisionist history that so often allows us to forget the darker side to our collective past. It recognizes that early American history is written by colonial winners, who have every reason to glorify their conquest and genocide — but that does not mean that we should continue the tradition. It ensures that future generations engage in thoughtful conversation about our national history and who we should choose to celebrate. Most importantly, it is a signal of respect toward Native Americans, for whom Columbus Day and Thanksgiving have only added emotional insult to centuries of injury. 
The effects of the the City Council’s decision certainly comes with political consequences. The Wall Street Journal  Editorial Board posited, “We wonder if the council knows it has given President Trump a political gift.” And so it has — the president and political right will surely seize the name change as evidence of the leftist totalitarian regime of political correctness. But that is no reason to fail to stand up for what is right. Los Angeles is making a bold statement, even though it would not have been seen as so before Donald Trump’s presidency. 
An insidious undercurrent ripples beneath the widespread conservative outrage at the renaming of Columbus Day — the notion that, just as removing Confederate general Robert E. Lee statutes will erase our national identity, so too will changing Columbus Day. But that claim entails the troubling assumption that our national identity is dictated to us by a genocidal conqueror. 
 Over 500 years later, with the tribulations of American history, I think we are better than that. I am proud that Los Angeles, in the face of the rise of racial hatred and white supremacy, has determined that it is better than that. This is what resistance looks like.

BTW Don. My dad retired as a CDR. US Navy in 1968. He flew the Douglas Navy jets in the 1950’s then moved over to multi-engine aircraft and finished his US Naval Aviator career as a C-130 jockey.  He was born in Norfolk, VA and we were stationed at Norfolk NAS Sept 1961 – August 1965. My sister and I went to St. Pius X Catholic School.  I used to FLY4FUN. So we do have something in common.  :-)
Nothing wrong with “National Indiginous Peoples” Day, but I see no reason to delete Columbus Day, George Washington’s Birthday or any other holiday that honors our country. The Confederation, its officials, officers and soldiers sought to destroy the Union, so one can see that the time to honor that act is over. As part of history, that deserves preserving and displaying Confederate art and sculpture – in museums.
Columbus and Washington made us possible, and if both acted according to what was moral and ethical in their time, but no in later times, that is no reason to repudiate them or remove display of the honors we owe them.
Columbus?? his nefarious rule over helpless natives……..the murder, the rapes, the forced pregnancies, the robbery…….and so on……..is NOTHING to be celebrated and should be studied as what NOT to do………..
Washington is fine….a hero…….trying and succeeding in enabling freedom and liberty……..
Columbus? all he did was provide a helpless group of people as victims for sex crazed, uncut Spaniards to spread their degenerate seed…….and to kill, murder. destroy and violate lands and people they should have studied and respected…
You are WRONG…..completely and severally…..too bad you cant be prosecuted for……..” opinions “
Dave, Are you serious? Or being sarcastic? I genuinely cannot tell. If serious, I guess some would agree with you, but it then becomes your moral duty to leave the US and go live elsewhere, lest you be considered profiting from the sins of Christopher Columbus.
Wrong in the Civil War comment Don. The South didn’t invade the North. The North fired the first shot at FT Dumpster from tax ship that was there to collect the 40% taxes for being a part of the Union. The North had more black slaves and tested them poorly compared to the Southerners who treated their slave very well, all things considered.   The northern bias of our education system has done you and most kids in America a disservice. The liberals changed they history books around 1960.  Money and power is what caused the Civil War. The North wanted more money from the southern businesses and stayed, and they wanted to take away the power of the purse from the southern states. The northern states bureaucrats were a bunch of conniving, nefarious creeps.
Thanks, Katman, for your interesting and unique view of US history at that time. I learn something every day from the comments here at this website.

On Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump formally rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, causing uncertainty and worry for many undocumented students such as sophomore Valeria Resendiz.
“My mom just always told me to not tell anyone about my status because she was afraid people would find out,” Resendiz said. “My parents always tried to keep information from us because they believed that the more we knew that the more it would put us in a vulnerable position.”
President Max C. L. Nikias issued a statement to the USC community on Monday in response to the impending announcement on the DACA program, an immigration policy implemented under the administration of former President Barack Obama in June 2012. The legislation allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of relief from deportation and eligibility for a work permit.
“USC is committed to continuing to work closely with all of our students to ensure that we are meeting their financial and academic needs, particularly those needs that might arise from changes in DACA,” Nikias said in the letter.
However, the rescinding still creates an unclear future for almost 800,000 young adults who are at risk for deportation — some of whom attend USC.
Nikias emphasized his own personal experience in the letter, as both he and his wife immigrated to the U.S., and the impact that American higher education had on his life.
Provost Michael Quick released a memorandum on DACA last week, outlining the legal and financial resources available to students who are DACA recipients. In the memo, Quick tasked Assistant Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez Brake with “navigating and facilitating support resources” at the campus cultural centers. In addition, he pointed students toward the Gould Legal Immigration Clinic and the Financial Aid Office to address any financial or legal conflicts that may come as a result of the decision.
“I want to reaffirm our unequivocal support for everyone in our community, regardless of immigration status or national origin,” Quick wrote in the memo. “We remain committed to our shared values of diversity, inclusion, and non-discrimination.”
Resendiz was born in Mexico but came to the United States when she was less than one year old. Resendiz says she has faced a lot of emotional stress because of her undocumented status. As for the future, Resendiz feels unclear.
“I would like that Congress comes up with something permanent that could find a way to make an immigration reform that would allow everyone an equal chance and the equal opportunities they deserve,” Resendiz said. 
For most undocumented and minority students, the cultural centers, such as Asian Pacific American Student Services (APASS), El Centro Chicano and the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs (CBCSA) are a safe haven and a home away from home. 
APASS Director Jonathan Wang said the DACA decision hits close to home in the Asian American community.
“[The DACA] decision now has created an environment that is unsafe and reinforces that there is a type of person that the government is focusing on as allowable or as a American,” Wang said.
Statistics show that one in 10 Asian Americans are undocumented, Wang said. He said many of these students are now left confused and wary about what the future looks like. 
“I think that overall there is a sense of uneasiness as to how the next six months will look like and whether they will be able to apply,” Wang said. “Six months from now we are not sure what the future looks like. For a lot of these students, parents and communities place a lot of hope on their students being here, and now there are a lot of concerns.” 
Marbella Pleitez, a junior studying political economy, felt anxious and conflicted upon hearing the news on DACA. Pleitez was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was 8 years old.
“I never knew that being undocumented was going to be a barrier, until I got to college,” Pleitez said. “I faced the language barrier, and I also had to get adjusted to the environment.” 
At a young age, Pleitez was confident about her enrollment at a university one day.  But, if it wasn’t for DACA, Pleitez acknowledged she wouldn’t be at USC.
“What would the U.S do without immigrants? Who is going to work in the fields? No — the U.S is in need of us.” Pleitez said.   
What gives foreign nationals the right to infiltrate our country and then smuggle in their children so that US taxpayers can subsidize their education?
Agreed….but blame the parents NOT the kids who have come to know NOTHING other than being Americans…..modify DACA…..give DACA’s RESPOPNSIBLITY ( military service, public service etc ) for them to EARN and ACHIEVE citizenship……..THAT is what is needed………
Unless you have a criminal record or some other major infractions or ties to terrorist organizations like Antifa, BAMN, BLM, ot others, you don’t have anything to worry about.  What you do need to do is be sure your paperwork is in order and current.  The alt-left media and the Democratic Party are lying to you when they say that President Trump is going to deport law abiding DREAMers.  If you read the document that President Trump made available, you’ll know that he is on your side.  The illegal executive order that Obama signed is being challenged in the federal court system by many states, and if this issue isn’t addressed via President Trump’s “nudging Congress to act” the courts are going to declare the Obama executive order as illegal and then you’ll be in much more trouble with the risk of deportation.  So be happy that we all have a President who has our interests at heart.  
As for Nikias’s story he came here legally.
If you were so interested in becoming a legal immigrant, why haven’t you applied for citizenship? The threat of deportation the Democrats hold over you is just that, a threat, and meant to manipulate you to hate conservatives.  Deportation is not an action that anyone would enforce unless you exhibit criminal behavior.  Remember that.
There are no shortcuts to citizenship, so your path to citizenship will be planned, but you will not get to jump to the front of the line. You will have to go through the process.  It is fair and just.  Just ask any legal immigrant who did go through the process of legal immigration?  Don’t be afraid. Don’t give up, but do make sure your paperwork is up to date, and get your citizenship path started.
Good luck.
you make many great points.  I am a naturalized citizen, took two years for my parents to complete all the paperwork…had interview with FBI to make sure I was not a Nazi or communist.  The whole issue is upside down.  Good points you made.

With President Donald Trump’s recent decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigration has become a topic of debate and discussion in the recent political climate, in regards to refugees, undocumented individuals and their experiences.
On Tuesday evening, students, professors and community members gathered for a Visions and Voices event titled “Borders, Bans, Walls, and Welcomes: U.S. Immigration Today.” 
Featuring Leilani Chan, founding artistic director of TeAda Productions, Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, and USC professor Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, the conversation focused on the immigrant experience, DACA and refugees.
The talk was moderated by Roberto Suro, a USC professor and author of Writing Immigration: Scholars and Journalists in Dialogue.
Suro started the conversation with DACA, a program that legally allows undocumented immigrants to work and live in the U.S.,  saying that it focuses on an important human connection to immigration policy.
“The issue of the Dreamers obliges us to think about immigration in terms of our kin, our neighbors, our classmates, our colleagues, our fellow Trojans,” Suro said. “It’s way of thinking about immigration as an element of policy that involves people who are already here, who are already part of our families, who are already part of our communities.”
Pastor also emphasized the importance of DACA through a personal anecdote about a young woman who he saw benefit from the policy.
 “DACA gave a bunch of young people a future — it allowed them to see themselves as part of a society that they grew up in, that they feel they are a part of, that they want to contribute to,” Pastor said. “The thing that we need to realize is that what this decision today did in its celebration of cruelty as public policy is to try to strip away people’s ability to imagine their future in the only country they’ve known.” 
Pastor added that he does not see Trump’s decision as being rooted in rational policy.
Both Noorani and Chan spoke about their professional work in the field of immigration reform. Noorani spoke about his work with the National Immigration Forum and in states such as Ohio and Iowa, which are struggling with the cultural changes that come with shifting demographics.
“For us as an organization, we really approached this with the idea that for the majority of Americans, the immigration debate isn’t about politics or policy,” Noorani said. “It’s not about politics and policy but about culture and values.” 
Chan talked about her experiences with TeAda Productions, a theater company that works with communities to collect stories about immigration and puts them on a stage.
Panel members stressed that a mass deportation would not solve problems, and instead would hurt the American economy.
“The best way to … make sure the undocumented worker, the legal immigrant worker and the American worker are not being exploited is to level the playing field so that everyone is competing for the same job at the same wage with the same legal status,” Noorani said.

On Tuesday night, the USG Senate approved the allocation of $10,000 for students affected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program policy change that will help fund their reapplication fee.
After President Donald Trump’s announcement to phase out DACA, Dunn urged decisive action.
“I will make it my absolute personal mission to ensure that every student’s needs are met,” Dunn said.
Dunn credited the writing of the DACA proposal to Vanessa Gomez Brake, the associate dean of religious life. 
The proposal states, “With the latest news from the White House, the emergency fund is as important as ever.” Dunn also highlighted prescribed actions for DACA students in the proposal.
“Any USC students who are already on DACA and have a renewal date in the next six months are being instructed to complete their renewal documentation before Oct. 5 of this year,” the proposal said.
The reapplication fee for DACA students is $500, and the $10,000 will be distributed to students for whom this cost is a heavy burden.
The senate also confirmed USG President Austin Dunn’s Chief Justice nominee, Charlynn Yeung. 
Last week, Dunn nominated Yeung to be the new chief justice of USC Student Judicial Affairs, pending Senate approval. She was confirmed unanimously by the Senate Tuesday night without debate or dissent.
Dunn also detailed some of the issues that he has been working on personally. One of the central issues that he hopes to address is sexual assault prevention.
“We want to educate our student leaders of our over 100 student organizations on campus to be effective bystanders,” Dunn said.
An ambitious goal that Dunn presented was more effective utilization of space on campus. However, he acknowledged, that it will be complicated.
“It is probably going to be the most difficult project I’ve worked on,” Dunn said. 
He explained, though, that the aim is focused.
“The ultimate goal is just to meet the needs of every single community or student that needs a resource center or lounge,” Dunn said.

With the expansion of social media, new tools and marketing conditions are now playing a large part in promoting brands, organizations and individuals. Reach, a new student organization focused on social media and online networking, aims to help those interested in these social networks by creating a space for influencers and digital marketers.
Markian Benhamou, a sophomore majoring in business administration, founded Reach because of his social media experience. As a social media influencer with over one million followers on Facebook, Benhamou realized that USC lacked a social media community — and he sought to change that. 
He conceived the idea of creating Reach during Spring 2017 and planned its debut throughout the summer with the help of a small team. He believes Reach has the potential to expand and eventually become the voice of USC.
 “Social media is a huge part of most [business to consumer] companies, and it’s been a completely new trend so I think it is crucial to have such a community here,” Benhamou said. “So, I talked with a few of my friends who are also passionate about social media and wanted to create this first organization here.” 
One of Reach’s team members is Xavier Di Petta, a junior majoring in business administration, who leads the digital marketing side of Reach. Di Petta’s role is to bring in Los Angeles’ best digital marketers and advise Reach members on a variety of projects. Di Petta has also been involved with other organizations at USC like Society 53, Spark SC and the Expat Society.
“I really like getting involved on campus and being in different clubs,” Di Petta said. “When Markian presented me with the opportunity, I thought it was a fantastic idea and I wanted to be a part of it regardless. There are really two sides to social media; it is influencers and digital marketing.” 
Di Petta has gained experience in the digital marketing field through freelance projects, working on mobile applications and raising $2 million for a startup. Apart from his involvement with multiple USC clubs, he is the founder of Well&Well, an agency that handles digital marketing for large brands.  
Reach team members plan to host workshops to teach members about how to build a following, manage Instagram pages, create viral content and market themselves as influencers. These workshops will feature guest speakers such as viral expert James Shamsi, along with social media influencers like Yes Theory, Nas Daily, Gabe Erwin and growth hackers like Jonathan Gaurano.
Matt Dajer, cofounder and producer of Yes Theory, expressed excitement about Reach and saw it as a platform for USC students to get a step ahead in the world of social media.
“When we were in college, we wish we had had resources other than the internet to help us learn skills around social media,” Dajer wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Digital is the future and influencer marketing will soon be a billion-dollar industry. If making online content is something you’re passionate about, then [this] kind of club is a once in a lifetime opportunity.”
Reach will help its members develop necessary skills during workshops, where they will work together on projects and ultimately try and build something that could potentially go viral. They also plan to organize social mixers for the members to network and establish connections with one another.
“We will have projects where we get everyone in the organization to build something together, whether it is Facebook skits or a viral video at USC,” Benhamou said. “In the end, we just want to make it a family-like community and build a strong relationship with everyone.”
The head of operations for Reach is Anirudh Kaushik, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration. Kaushik’s role is to facilitate the events that Reach will be organizing throughout the semester and give its members the best experience they can get.
“USC is in a prime location for such a club with Hollywood near it and Los Angeles is basically where there is a high concentration of content creators,” Kaushik said. “And with Markian’s reach into these communities, [we] can bridge that connection between existing influencers and upcoming influencers at USC.” 
Additionally, the club also plans on focusing on outreach within the University and creating a positive public image. 
“It is our first year, so we want to make sure that our impression … would be a good, strong one,” said Selina Lee, Reach’s community outreach director.
