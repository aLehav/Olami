The United States District Court of Central California denied a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed $215 million class-action settlement brought by victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall Thursday, according to District Court minutes obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
USC reached the proposed settlement, which will distribute tiered compensation to all former patients of Tyndall, if passed. The University agreed to file the settlement in February 2019. 
Though 650 victims have filed suits against Tyndall and the University, the agreement outlined a settlement distribution for an estimated 17,000 former patients. The agreement also included a series of reforms the University must implement with regard to sexual or racial misconduct complaints.
“The Court’s primary concerns with the proposed settlement, and the reasons for the Court’s decision to deny the motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, are two-fold,” the court wrote in an order to USC. “The Court and class members lack information about certain key components of the settlement, and the Court believes that some of the procedures for administering the settlement are unfair or inadequate.”
According to the order, the court expressed concerns with the “informational deficiencies” in the agreement. In particular, the court alleges the settlement does not adequately explain the pro rata reductions in the second and third tiers, which vary in amount depending on how much information former Tyndall patients are willing to bring forward. 
“The Court would be concerned about class members being misled into believing that their award will be higher than their actual amount of compensation received,” the court wrote. “Simply put, the current description is inadequate to inform class members about the estimated variation in their potential recovery.”
Moreover, the court said it is concerned with who will determine the adjustments made to compensations within each tier and when they will be made.
In addition to concerns regarding victim compensation, the court requested the University submit all relevant information regarding Tyndall’s personnel file, complaints made during his employment and USC’s knowledge, or lack thereof, over the past three decades.
“Such information would be necessary for the Court to satisfy its burden under Rule 23 — to ensure that notice to class members of the proposed settlement would be appropriate,” the court wrote. 
The court said class members should be provided with more information before moving forward with the settlement.
“Class members need to know exactly what USC’s responsibilities would be on an ongoing basis to monitor, prevent and respond to abuse committed by staff or other professionals employed by the school,” the court wrote. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said it will work to address the  concerns raised by the court. 
“We continue to believe that the federal class action settlement offers a fair and reliable alternative to individual litigation in state court,” USC wrote. “This settlement is designed to provide relief in a manner that respects the dignity and privacy of all women impacted by this experience, by allowing them to receive compensation without the difficulty or uncertainty of a public trial, regardless of when their visits occurred.”
According to the order, the University providing more information in the settlement may influence whether or not individuals decide to remain part of it. 
“The decision of many class members whether to remain in the settlement class may turn on the adequacy of the equitable measures in the settlement, and without knowing what USC would be bound to do on a granular level, class members would be deprived of the opportunity to voice their concerns about the equitable relief reached by the Committee,” the court wrote. 
Additionally, the court was concerned with procedural practices with the settlement. It claims the decision-making process, where the court nominates a retired judge to make settlement determinations as a Special Master, may result in arbitrary decisions.
Alternatively, the court recommended a committee of three individuals, including the Special Master, an OB/GYN and a forensic psychologist.
The court ordered USC to file renewed motions for preliminary approval and for the appointment of a special master within 30 days of Thursday. The court also asked the University to address the concerns and ordered parties to review all documents pertaining to the complaints against Tyndall within seven days of the order.

The First Generation Student Union held a solidarity rally Thursday to express their frustrations about the lack of resources available to first-generation students. The event was held at Tommy Trojan with more than 50 students and faculty in attendance. 
Members of multiple organizations, including the Latinx Student Association, Black Student Association, Center for Political Future and USC College Democrats attended in support of the rally.
“The purpose of this rally is really more so empowerment and reassurance among the first-generation community, especially now more than ever in light of recent events,” said FGSU president Valentin Avila.
Throughout the rally, students chanted, “Let’s be realistic, we’re not a statistic.” 
Organizers said this was in reference to how the University promotes diversity and a high acceptance rate of first-generation students, who constitute 17% of the student body, yet offers little to no resources for them.
“Especially when we’re talking about how [the USC administration] boasts about the first-gen community,” said freshman Jennifer Jimenez, the programming chair of FGSU. “They are proud of their diverse population, but what are [they] doing to serve communities of color or minority communities?”
Avila said he feels the University has improperly addressed the first-gen population and the barriers to education they face.
“There’s that disconnect among the administration and our population,” Avila said. “We are [some] of the most resilient and tenacious people out there, but I’m tired of having this used as a justification for the way they treat us.”
FGSU lead organizer Miriham Antonio said the point of the rally was to address first-generation concerns and advocate for more scholarships and a first-generation office on campus. Currently, the University offers the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, Trojan Guardian Scholars and First-Generation Mentor Program for first-generation students. 
“There is currently no physical meeting space for first-generation students,” Antonio said. “As a reminder, UCLA, Stanford and [other universities] have a first-gen office, so it’s appalling that USC, with the money that they have, have not created this.”
During the rally, Antonio and Rogers read out a letter — which was also posted on change.org — addressed to President-elect Carol Folt. As of Thursday night, there were 62 signatures on the change.org petition. The letter called for updated information about first-generation resources on the USC website, provision of affordable professional clothing and training, a textbook lending system, scholarship and program funding and translation services for first-generation parents.
The letter also called for increased transparency and accountability from the administration in working with first-generation students to better address resource concerns.
“We ask USC to create an official first-generation advisory board, in which first-generation student representatives can meet with all diversity and inclusion directors to voice the needs of first-generation students,” said FGSU treasurer Kwaku Rogers. “In the past, the concerns and needs of the first-generation community on campus have not been acknowledged or heard.”
Multiple student advocates spoke to the crowd about their unique experiences as first-generation students. 
Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Omar Garcia said he will continue to advocate for the needs of those at the rally. 
“I’ve realized very quickly that I was alone … statistically I’m supposed to drop out within the next two years,” said Garcia, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Getting here is only half the battle, and I want to end the journey … with everyone here.”
Omar was the only USG Senator that spoke at the event. President Trenton Stone, Vice President Mahin Tahsin and other USG executive board members stopped by the rally intermittently, and the Black Student Assembly co-sponsored the event on behalf of USG.
Stone said external assemblies and committees within USG’s branches choose which events to co-sponsor.
“For this rally specifically, BSA co-sponsored the rally, so that falls under the larger USG umbrella, just as if any other organization co-sponsored an event,” Stone said. “Each group … will actually process and do the co-sponsorship, but they do it on behalf of USG. They act on behalf of USG, but it’s their own group and under their own discretion to do that sponsorship.”
Trista Beard, the associate director for the Norman Topping Scholarship — a scholarship specifically for local and first-generation students — said that the rally was not inspired by the recent college admissions scandal, which USC was at the forefront of. Instead, the rally was a long-running FGSU project.
Jimenez said she agreed with Beard, but that the scandal was a contributing reason for why this rally was essential to her. 
”There has been multiple efforts in the past … but [the scandal] wasn’t … the main purpose,” Jimenez said. “It reminded us that [resources for first-gen students] is what we’re advocating for.” 
Antonio said the rally’s timing was also necessary, as the University is undergoing extensive leadership changes.
“The rally is necessary especially now that we [have] just sworn in a new USC president and since she’s choosing the new provost,” Antonio said. “I think this is the right time to bring attention to the concerns of first-gen students who have felt like … they have been neglected by past USC leadership.”

USC hired Nielsen Merksamer Parrinello Gross and Leoni LLP, a San Francisco-based lobbying firm, March 1 to oppose legislation introduced to the California Assembly that would create a one-year window for lawyers to revive cases that are time-barred by California’s statute of limitations.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote, “Universities routinely contract with lobbying firms to assist with policy or legislative matters.”
In February, USC filed an agreement to settle a $215 million class-action lawsuit, which detailed the amounts that are to be distributed to all former patients of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who has been sued for sexual assault and misconduct by more than 650 women through state and federal courts. The allegations made against Tyndall first came to light last May in a Los Angeles Times investigation, which detailed decades of abuse while Tyndall was employed at the Engemann Student Health Center.
With the firm, the University is working to lobby against Assembly Bill 1510, which was introduced by Assemblymember Eloise Gomez Reyes of Grand Terrace Feb. 22. If passed, AB 1510 would allow victims of Tyndall’s abuse to seek claims, despite the previously established statute of limitations.
The current statute of limitations is determined by AB 1619, which was put into effect on Jan. 1, extends the statute for adult victims of sexual assault from two to 10 years after the assault. The bill also grants adult victims up to three years to file suit after discovery for actions.
According to the bill, the one-year window issued by AB 1510 would be made only for claims for damages “arising out of sexual assault or misconduct by a physician occurring at a student health center.” Victims whose claims expire prior to Jan. 1, 2020, would have until Jan. 1, 2021, to file their lapsed claim for damages. 
AB 1510 can apply to the plaintiffs seeking to file suit in the Tyndall case, as well as the 21 plaintiffs who have come forward against former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly and the University. According to the complaint obtained by the Daily Trojan, these plaintiffs, most of whom identify as gay or bisexual, alleged that Kelly sexually harassed them during appointments at Engemann.
According to Assembly Judiciary Committee Chair Mark Stone’s policy analysis, which was presented during a hearing of AB 1510 April 9, the bill can potentially bring claims that have been voided due to the current statute of limitations.
“While the bill does not name USC or Dr. Tyndall, the bill clearly seeks to allow the USC victims, in particular, to revive claims barred by the statute of limitations in effect,” Stone wrote in his analysis, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan. “Sponsored by the Consumer Attorneys of California, the bill has the support of several consumer, civil rights and women’s groups.”
Stone wrote that the University opposes AB 1510 because the bill might “disrupt” the pending federal class-action settlement.
“[It would be] in part by encouraging members of the class to opt out of the settlement in order to bring or join a separate civil action,” Stone wrote. “[The bill] creates a one-year window in which certain victims of sexual assault may revive claims for damages that are otherwise time-barred by a statute of limitations.”
According to Stone’s documents, USC officials responded to the court in a letter of opposition to AB 1510, claiming it would interfere with the University’s settlement and compensation distribution. 
“[The bill is] a blatant attempt to interfere with the proposed federal settlement and all the beneficial provisions found within the settlement,” USC wrote. “The federal settlement includes a monetary remedy for every single member of the class regardless of whether the claim is facially barred by the statute of limitations.” 
According to Stone’s analysis, USC wrote that while University officials appreciate the intention of AB 1510, the bill would bring harm to individuals in the settlement. 
“[Though] California has led the nation in enacting progressive legislation in support of survivors of sexual assault and sexual misconduct … The proposed legislation [AB 1510] is unnecessary and harmful to California plaintiffs,” USC wrote.
Stone said that the legislature should consider the complexity behind sexual assault claims.
“In recent years, the legislature has attempted to take account of the fact that typical statutes of limitation — which require a plaintiff to bring an action within a reasonable period of time — fail to accommodate the complex and delayed process of dealing with, and sometimes even remembering, sexual abuse and assault,” Stone wrote.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Gloria Allred, a women’s rights attorney representing 62 plaintiffs in the Tyndall case, said hiring the lobbying firm worsens the harm done to victims.
“It is despicable that for decades, USC allowed Dr. Tyndall to sexually assault young USC students for whom USC had responsibility, and that now, to make matters worse, USC is hiring a lobbyist to try to prevent legislation which would allow many victims to recover damages which resulted from USC[’s] own malfeasance,” Allred wrote.                           
John Manly, an attorney representing several other victims, said it is unfortunate that USC hired the same firm that USA Swimming hired to lobby against bills that aimed to protect swimmers from “predatory” coaches. 
Manly said lobbying against the legislation would harm victims who spoke out after the statute of limitations expired. 
“These women didn’t come forward earlier, not because they sat on their rights, but because they didn’t know that what Tyndall was doing was abuse,” Manly said. “He was a really effective and pernicious perpetrator … There is a mountain of evidence the University knew, and [USC] covered it up.”
According to Consumer Attorneys of California, AB 1510’s sponsor, the bill would provide victims the opportunity to seek justice against the University and Tyndall. 
“[It] will give sexual assault student victims … a chance to have their civil claims heard in court by clearly reviving potentially lapsed claims for a short period of one year,” the CAOC wrote in its letter of support of the bill. “USC’s failure to investigate and address complaints of Dr. Tyndall’s sexual assault on students allowed him to continue to assault hundreds of students over the years. These victims need justice.”

Nearly 70 members of USC Forward, a coalition of community organizers, local residents, students and alumni, marched from Jefferson Boulevard to Bovard Auditorium Thursday. Several organizers presented University Chief of Staff Dennis Cornell with a sleeping bag — as a representation of the displaced South Los Angeles residents — scribbled with student concerns and demands.
Cornell accepted the sleeping bag following a nearly six-minute confrontation with the organizers, who marched Tuesday to deliver a list of demands to incoming President-elect Carol Folt. Cornell said the University responded to the coalition’s demands regarding graduate student unionization efforts, but the University would not address concerns from the surrounding community.
“You’re actually not in this community,” Cornell said to the organizers. “You’re actually in another community on the other side of town.”
On Tuesday, USC Forward pledged to march again if the University did not respond to their demands within 48 hours following that day’s march. USC sent an official letter on Thursday morning; however, the University only penned the letter in response to the one graduate student whose name was signed at the end of the document. Due to the University’s lack of timely response, USC Forward marched Thursday.
Demonstrators began protesting Saturday with the creation of “Tent City,” a group of 10 tents situated along Jefferson, where the organizers have been camping out in 24/7.
Protesters held signs Thursday that read “School of Injustice,” “USC For All (Not Ju$t for Few),” and “USC School of Displacement,” as they marched the entirety of “Tent City” down Trousdale Parkway.
In the letter delivered to the University Tuesday, the organization called for admission accessibility, housing affordability, community benefits, campus safety and labor rights.
Throughout the week-long demonstration, USC Forward encouraged students to jot down their concerns and demands for the University on the sleeping bag. On the sleeping bag, students wrote that USC should recognize student and worker unionization efforts and take accountability for the gentrification and displacement that persist in surrounding communities. 
When the sleeping bag was presented to Cornell Thursday, he said the issue of unionizing is not new to the administration and that the University will answer those concerns. 
“This is not a new circumstance for us,” Cornell said. “Our response … is not to the leaders of the union, its to our graduate students. Our deference is to our graduate students, and that’s what we responded to.” 
In a response to USC Forward’s letter, Vice Provost Marty Levine wrote that the McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative, the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, the USC Strategic Plan — which houses research on local homelessness — among other initiatives, all show the University’s commitment to USC Forward’s demands.
Regarding the construction of USC Village and concerns regarding local gentrification, Levine said USC Village has provided many benefits for the community, such as economic prosperity and providing nearly $20 million for affordable housing. 
“The benefits also included building a state-of-the-art fire station for the neighborhood,”  Levine wrote. “Development of the community benefit plans included local residents and stakeholders.”
Cue Jn’Marie, a pastor from Church Without Walls in Skid Row, has lived in neighborhoods in Los Angeles such as Crenshaw and Watts. Jn’Marie said he and other local residents want to support students and displaced community members. 
 “We will not be satisfied until we get a meeting, a sit-down meeting with the president,” Jn-Marie said. “You’re telling me I don’t live here … I live in this state. I live in this city. I’ve lived in this community.”
In a statement following the protest Tuesday, USC said the president’s office received USC Forward’s list of demands and that it had been working on these issues long before the demonstrations began. 
“The University’s singular focus continues to be the students, patients and community we serve,” the statement read. “As noted on the change.usc.edu web site, many of the ideas and suggestions made in the letter are already well underway.”
During the protest, local residents, students and members of the Service Employees International Union and Alliance for Californians for Community Empowerment held a banner that read “USC Accountability Now.”
“Today, I came to support mostly,” said Kameron Hurt, a junior majoring in international relations. “We had some great speakers, I helped hold some signs and gave my voice as an undergraduate student to this cause because it is good for undergraduate students to get involved, and it’s even better when they work with the community.”
Nathaniel Hyman, a sophomore majoring in public policy, said although he is in favor of USC Forward, he is concerned with the vagueness of their demands.
“They are not quantitative metrics with those demands,” Hyman said. “But, I support the sentiment behind all of these, and I’m glad they’re forcing the University to make a conversation on them, and I think once we have this conversation we can go into trying to make sure the school is more representative of the population surrounding the University.” 
Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas said DPS had conversations with the demonstrators throughout the week and knew they would be holding a protest on campus Thursday. Thomas asked the protesters to finish their demonstration to allow students to get to class without disruption and said they were cooperative. 
Protestors left their tents in Hahn Plaza for DPS to donate.
“We were willing to facilitate them exercising the First Amendment,” Thomas said. “They did exactly what they told us they were going to do, and things worked out. 
Coral Itzcalli, a spokesperson for USC Forward, said the demonstration was confirmation that various groups are united in protesting the University administration. Though the “Tent City” demonstration has ended, the organization will continue to communicate with the administration.
“USC’s response to what’s going on in their own campus is laughable … This idea that they care about students is obviously false,” Itzcalli said. “USC is doing what USC does, which is using its money and its power not to help their students but figure out how to rig the system so it can continue to get away with it, whether it’s turning a blind eye to the sexual harassment or assault on campus.”

USC Hillel removed its name from the Nice Jewish Queers’ Passover Drag Show Facebook event page just before the event occurred Tuesday. USC Hillel said they removed their name because the NJQ added USC Jewish Voice for Peace as a co-sponsor. Hillel 
Hillel International restricts partnerships with organizations, like JVP, that do not support Israel’s existence as a Jewish state, allegedly causing the removal of NJQ’s status as a USC Hillel affiliated organization from the event Facebook page description.
“Upon learning that ‘Nice Jewish Queers’ was co-planning and co-sponsoring its Passover Drag Show with University of Southern California’s Queer and Ally student assembly and USC’s Jewish Voice for Peace Chapter, USC Hillel forced NJQ to stop referring to itself as a Hillel-affiliated organization,” Ariella Amit wrote in a public statement on behalf of Open Hillel, a organization focused on fostering openness and inclusivity within the Hillel community.
In the statement, Open Hillel called for USC Hillel and Hillel International to “reaffiliate with NJQ without preconditions and revoke the Standards of Partnership.” 
USC Hillel clarified NJQ’s status as a USC Hillel organization in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
“Contrary to misinformation, Nice Jewish Queers remains an affiliate organization of USC Hillel,” the statement read. “USC Hillel disassociated from an event organized by Nice Jewish Queers because Jewish Voices for Peace was added as a co-sponsor without coordination with the primary event sponsors.”
Amit, who helped organize the event on behalf of NJQ and is employed at USC Hillel, said JVP was added as an event sponsor after initial planning had already taken place. QuASA was a co-sponsor since the beginning of the planning process and helped fund the event.
“So I think that these standards of partnership prioritize Hillel’s Israel advocacy over the interests of students, and that is harmful to the organization, and a lot of it’s students who are already marginalized by their identities,” Amit said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Roy Pankey, the student who emceed the event, said he was surprised by the addition of the JVP sponsorship. He said he first learned of the sponsorship was when the logo was placed in the header image of the event Facebook page.
“In several preliminary discussions and meetings about the drag show, JVP was never mentioned as a sponsor,” said Pankey, a junior majoring in journalism. “If JVP had been mentioned, somebody from Hillel would’ve definitely spoken up.”
Students who attended the drag show said the event itself did not contain any political tension and went as planned. Concerns only rose before and after, said Lucy Allen, a  junior majoring in cinema and media studies who performed in the show.
Students primary concerns are focused on increasing USC Hillel’s inclusivity.
“I find it problematic that Hillel claims to be this safe space for Jewish students on campus but then heads up this rhetoric that makes Jewishness is synonymous with support for Israel,” said Allen. “A lot of people myself included is not at all the case on critical support for Israel and I find it really objectionable.”

The Women of Troy will conclude their regular season with one last opportunity to seize the Pac-12 regular-season title and claim the conference tournament’s top seed spot with a meeting against Arizona State Saturday. Prior to the match, the Trojans will honor four seniors who are competing in their last regular season match. 
USC’s Senior Day game will celebrate the careers and contributions of attackers Emily Concialdi, Amanda Flayhan and Gabbi Klein, and defender Jackie Gilbert in pre-game ceremonies. The seniors hope to help the team one last time by securing the conference regular season title as they conclude their collegiate careers. 
“Going into the Pac-12 tournament, we are focusing on playing together and pushing each other every practice,” sophomore goalie Riley Hertford said. “We know what we need to work on and that we can make the changes.” 
Hertford posted nine saves and had a pair of ground balls during the last match against ASU. 
The Trojans will enter their weekend match ranked No. 16 in the IWLCA coaches poll for the 51st consecutive week with a 13-3 overall season record. Additionally, the Trojans lead the Pac-12 and are 10th in the NCAA in scoring defense with an 8.30 goals-against average.
The Trojans logged the first and only shutout in both the program and Pac-12’s history with a 16-0 victory over Oregon last weekend at McAlister Field. During their 2013 season, the fewest goals ever allowed by USC was in a 19-1 victory over Fresno State. 
With their hearts set on their chance to claim the tournament title, the Women of Troy want to compete as the powerhouse they were earlier in the season when they last met with the Sun Devils. USC successfully collected its seventh-straight conference-opening victory on a 15-3 win over Arizona State. Moreover, USC’s overall record against Arizona State is 4-0 all-time and 2-0 all-time in the state of Arizona. 
Despite a loss against USC, the Sun Devils have impressive and  dominant offensive skills that have made them a competitive foe this season. The Sun Devils currently hold fifth place in the league standings with room to fluctuate in the rankings depending on this week’s results. ASU is scheduled to play San Diego State in a midweek non-conference matchup before facing the Trojans.  
Among ASU’s key players is junior attacker Kerri Clayton, the Devils’ offensive leader with 32 goals and 43 points this season. ASU’s top distributor is sophomore midfielder Emily Glagolevis, who holds an impressive season record of 18 points and 23 assists. 
Another notable player who leads the team is sophomore midfielder Kylie Kroeger with 27 draw controls and 13 caused turnovers. Sheranks second with 28 ground balls. Finally, one of the Devils’ helping hands in defense this season is junior goalkeeper Berkeley Bonneau, who tops all Devils with 37 ground balls and a .477 save percentage. 
The match against familiar foe in ASU should bring out USC’s top players who have made their presence known on the field all season long. USC’s team leader is sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff who has racked up 42 points on 36 goals and six assists this season. Huff has also accumulated 29 ground balls and 25 caused turnovers. Following closely behind Huff’s impressive record this season is sophomore midfielder Sophia Donovan, who has added 40 points on 27 goals for the Trojans. 
“We know what we need to work on and that we can make the changes,” Hertford said. “We are so close to our goals and I am confident that the team is ready to put in the work to achieve them.”
The Trojans will face ASU at McAlister Field at 2 p.m. Saturday on Senior Day.

Next week, the golf postseason will start for the No. 6-ranked USC men’s squad as they enter the Pac-12 tournament Monday. They hope to achieve the same level of success as the women’s team did this past week at the women’s Pac-12 championship.
In the Pac-12 tournament, the No. 1-ranked Women of Troy dominated the competition, winning the conference championship by a resounding 11 strokes over No. 2 Arizona. The Trojans were the only team to finish under par overall and showed the conference why they are the top-ranked team in the nation. The win was the women’s sixth Pac-12 title and the sixth win of the season overall.  
Head coach Justin Silverstein was happy with the team’s outing.
“It went really well even though the course was really tough and tricky,” Silverstein said. “We limited bogeys, got a lot of pars and did a really good job playing consistently.”
Sophomore Gabriela Ruffels led the way for the Trojans, finishing at 3 under for the tournament, which was good for a third place finish individually. Ruffels’ outstanding performance through the first two days culminated in a score of 68 on the third day. That score was the second lowest overall in the entire tournament, setting her apart from the rest of the field. Junior Allisen Corpuz, sophomore Jennifer Chang and sophomore Alyaa Abdulghany also finished in the top seven individually. 
“I think all five of us [starters] are really good players, and we prepared the right way so that we could put out a good performance,” Corpuz said.
Corpuz, who had one of her best outings of the season at the tournament, will look to continue her success as the postseason progresses at regionals.
Four of the women were also named to the All-Pac-12 First Team, including Chang, Ruffels, sophomore Amelia Garvey and freshman Malia Nam. Even though the program is already dominating the NCAA, these underclassmen show that the team will only improve.
The women hope to continue their elite play at regionals, where they seek to earn a spot in the NCAA championships, which will be held in May at the University of Arkansas.
“Stanford has two of the best four players in the world, which is always huge,” Silverstein said. “And Arizona played really well this past week at the Pac-12 tourney.”  
As for other dangerous teams, Silverstein will be looking out for Texas, which has been on USC’s tail for the No. 1 spot the whole season along with Florida, Wake Forest and Duke.
If rankings hold USC in the No. 1 spot, the women will head up to Cle Elum, Wash. and the Tumble Creek Golf Course for regionals in just a couple weeks.  
“The course at Cle Elum is really hard and tough but suits us well,” Silverstein said. “The conditions will be tough because it will be windier than usual.”
The men will enter the Pac-12 tournament play April 22 and will most likely face stiffer competition than the women. Although the men won the Pac-12 title in 2018, this year they will have to deal with No. 2-ranked Arizona State, who have won their last three tournaments.
The Trojans just competed in the Western Intercollegiate tournament, finishing fourth overall in the field behind the aforementioned Cal and first place Stanford.  
Their outing was definitely not what the team was looking for as a rough second day of play hindered them from hanging onto the third place spot.
For No. 1-ranked amateur senior Justin Suh, the tournament was also not his best performance, finishing in seventh after he couldn’t recover from a 74 on the second day of play.  Although sophomore Kaito Onishi and freshman Cameron Henry finished in the top five, Suh ended up in seventh after he couldn’t recover from a 74 on the second day of play.  
Overall, the team did not perform terribly, but with both Arizona State and now Stanford heating up as the postseason approaches, USC’s title defense is in danger.
As in the past, the team will rely on Suh to carry them in the postseason.  He is still the world’s top-ranked amateur and in the team’s one tournament without him this season, the squad suffered a rough 10th place finish. For the men to succeed next week, the rest of the team will have to step up their game.  
The road to Arkansas and the NCAA championships appears to be very tough for the men’s squad, but it has both the talent and the skills to pull it off. First, however, the Trojans must try to defend their Pac-12 title against a very competitive field next week.

In sports, emotions often get the best of us. In the heat of the moment, with two teams stacked with some of the best talent in the world competing for the precious win, it’s easy to lose sight of proper behavior.
The wonderful thing about sports is that, to an extent, each sport has a way of policing itself, aside from the official’s interjection. Some are more blatant than others. Take hockey, for example. If you land a dirty hit on a star player, you better be ready to fight. In baseball, if you disrespect a pitcher by throwing your bat toward them after putting a ball into the bleachers, you better walk up to your next at bat with some extra padding.
These are the “unwritten rules.” There is a degree of respect in these rules that causes players to take action when they are disrespected. It doesn’t matter if a penalty is called or a player is ejected — the game has now become personal.
Yesterday, fans witnessed baseball’s unwritten rules in action. In a close game between the Royals and White Sox, Sox shortstop Tim Anderson launched a home run, threw his bat towards his dugout and exchanged frustrated words and looks with both the Royals catcher and pitcher.
I hope Anderson wore extra padding when he came up again in the sixth. Royals pitcher Brad Keller, abiding by the unwritten rules, delivered a 92 mph fastball to Anderson’s backside. As expected, the benches cleared, tempers flared and the managers were at each other’s throats.
In response to the incident, USA Today wrote an article titled “MLB’s problem: Let the kids play … or adhere to unwritten rules?” I want to address that question in this column. The unwritten rules of sports are essential to the game. Maybe that’s because I’m from Michigan and grew up playing hockey with Canadians. Hockey easily has the most vicious unwritten rules among major sports. It’s been that way for a long time. 
Permitting fighting among players gives the game a way of policing itself and an outlet to release frustration. Referee interjection can only go so far, however players will be punished accordingly. The fear of having a player like Bob Probert or Darren McCarty give you the business if you land a dirty hit or show up a player is enough to prevent a lot of players from exhibiting that disrespect.
The same goes for baseball. The problem in baseball is that the umpire’s interjection is flawed. In hockey, players are allowed to settle their beef and are then given five minute penalties for fighting. There’s nothing like that in baseball. The umpire either tosses the player or he doesn’t. It is a complete judgement call, and too often that judgement is unfair. 
It’s tough to look for a perfect solution in an imperfect situation. Players will never stop pimping homers, hitting each other or clearing the bench. If MLB wants to take action, it needs to devise a solution that allows for these unwritten rules to exist while standardizing a way to deal with players enforcing the unwritten rules. 
Personally, I’m fine with how baseball runs right now. It’s not a perfect solution of punishment, but baseball is an imperfect game. Balls and strikes aren’t perfect, and neither are ejections. 
A lot of fans, along with MLB, worry about players getting hurt from a pitcher beaming the batter. There is a good way to prevent most of that: Bring yourself back down to earth, and don’t disrespect the pitcher. I realize that this won’t solve all of the problems, but it is a good way to mitigate at least a significant portion of the risk. 
My verdict: Adhere to the unwritten rules, but don’t let things get out of hand.

Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Home of flower crowns and perfectly curated Instagram photos. A sanctuary for artists and drug-using music lovers. Above all, an escape from the mundanity of everyday life — at least for those lucky enough to be able to afford a ticket.
Coachella’s decades-long history is perhaps the most interesting in contemporary festival culture. 
Beginning as a rock festival hosting headliners like Beck and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coachella quickly evolved into a cultural phenomenon. It was commodified, from art installations acting as backdrops for influencer marketing posts to the profound recognition an artist receives after performing on one of the five main stages. Despite its injection into pop culture, Coachella remains a wonderfully human experience.
This year’s show was nothing short of revolutionary. Its headliners — Childish Gambino, Tame Impala and Ariana Grande — were each unparalleled in their own ways. None of the three was initially well-received as a headliner of the prestigious festival. While Grande’s performance faltered, the two others broke new ground and silenced naysayers. 
Gambino took an intimate approach to his set, literally hovering over the audience before engaging with them directly, even offering a joint to a lucky fan in the front row. What followed was a string of his biggest hits and most vulnerable deep cuts. Similarly, Tame Impala’s performance saw frontman Kevin Parker hiding behind mind-numbing visuals that gave the music space to breathe. 
Surprisingly, it was the smaller acts from this year’s roster that shone the brightest. 
Indie rock and EDM were the main draws of the festival with acts Rüfüs Du Sol, Gesaffelstein, Polo & Pan and King Princess drawing huge crowds to their sets. Bringing with them a sense of individuality, charisma and charm, each artist was able to completely captivate audiences for hourlong sets that often felt like a passing moment.
One of the biggest breakthroughs, however, was rising hip-hop rapper-singer Lizzo. Through songs about self-love and positivity, the Minneapolis-based artist incited a euphoric frenzy — one that only grew louder throughout the duration of the set. Lizzo was able to get her message across to the audience loudly and clearly, despite minor technical difficulties. 
She even asserted, “When I’m headlining next time, I’m gonna need my motherfucking ears to work.” 
After this performance, a headlining set from Lizzo at any other festival should be welcomed with open arms.
In the audience was fan and peer Janelle Monáe, who brought out Lizzo and Philly rapper Tierra Whack during her own spectacular set on Friday. Monae’s performance was akin to that of Beyoncé’s at Coachella 2018, blending her immaculate vocals with moves reminiscent of a Bruno Mars show. At the same time, Monáe’s performance felt innovative, original and inspiring. Both her set and Lizzo’s converged thematically, drawing upon ideas of unity and transcendence.
Coachella is not what it has become because of the glossy Instagrams and the endless pot of ticket revenue. It is not measured by likes or by the beautifully assembled outfits. It is a memorable experience simply because it brings hundreds of thousands of people together for a shared desire of togetherness and escapism.
Lizzo herself encapsulates the message of the festival best, saying: “I want people to feel that closeness, because if you can love me as much as you do without knowing me, and without me being like this archetype of modern beauty in media, then you can love yourself.”
This year’s Coachella, as is the case in most years, was a bop.

Daily Trojan: You’re at the beginning of your music career with a bright future ahead of you. What does your music mean to you at this moment?
Golden Landis Von Jones: To me, music is everything. The fact that I’m able to make music every single day and live a lifestyle that I enjoy is all I ever want. Everything else comes extra. Music is my expression, my outlet and my favorite thing to do.
DT: Has music always been something present in your life, or is it something you picked up later?
G: I sang in the choir in middle school and high school, and, with that, its importance in my life has grown with my own growth. 
DT: What drives you to make music? Where does your inspiration come from? 
G: I’m a little bit more reserved emotionally, and music is an outlet for me to channel how I really feel, and I want to make sure other people can feel that, too. A sense of relatability in melodies, tones and lyrics is channeled and created through the human experience. 
DT: Aside from being a musician, you’re also a student. What keeps you committed to school rather than pursuing music full-time?
G: I really didn’t know that things were going to happen so fast when I came to USC. I had anticipated not finishing school all the way through. I could’ve taken a leave of absence after my first semester to focus heavily on music, but I wanted to round off the school year to further develop the relationships I’ve made here. I love being on campus, and I think being a student keeps me grounded. Yes, I might be doing a big show, but at the end of the day, I’m running back to my dorm, just like everybody else. 
DT: Do you have any other musicians or people you see as mentors, considering you’re entering this industry at such a young age? Where do you turn to when you feel lost?
G: The person who got me my record deal, [producer] D.A. Doman, is an incredible mentor and role model. Although he isn’t an artist and is more of a producer and songwriter, I can always go to him with any question I have. My biggest mentor though has to be Paperboy, who is a rapper, store owner, sneaker influencer. He is the person who got me into recording music. He really helped me grow as a person, and I attribute a lot of my maturity and development to him. 
DT: Many of your songs are very high-energy. How does 24kGoldn rewind and relax when he’s stressed?
G: I like to do face masks. I think it’s incredibly important to take time and do things for yourself. For the past two months, I was in the studio every single day writing songs for other people. I felt like I was getting to the point of burning out, so I had to put things into perspective and take a step back. It’s O.K. to sometimes lay in bed, hit the dab pen and watch Netflix all day. Sometimes you need that, and it can never be something you feel bad about. 
DT: Do you have certain songs you listen to when you want to destress? 
G: Yeah, I have a chill playlist! It has a lot of Frank Ocean. 
DT: Do you see those genres inspiring your own music ever? 
G: Recently, yes. Before I would only listen to hip-hop or rap all the time. The music that I currently have out is very high-energy, like “Valentino,” but those were recorded over a year ago and don’t exactly reflect the person I have become since then. They’re still important for people to listen to, and I’m glad that they can represent that time in my life. However, I have a new song that will be out on SoundCloud called “Lot to Lose,” which is completely different. 
DT: Do you think this evolution of style is reflective of your own personal maturity since entering college and living in Los Angeles? 
G: I think that’s definitely how it’s going, but it also has a lot to do with my own personal experimentation with styles of music. I think I’m starting to find my style, but I don’t ever want to be constricted by one genre. You don’t need to just do one thing and stick to it. I’m not that type of person.
DT: How would you describe your music to someone who has never heard it?
G: That’s tough because depending on what song you listen to my music can be described different ways. I think it’s something that people just have to decide themselves when they listen. 
DT: Finally, where does 24kGoldn go from here?
G: I think the goal is to just have more people hear my music. I believe that what I’m making is quality, and I think that other people who hear my music understand that.
