Many of USC’s graduate schools have the most prominent academic schools and programs in their field, according to the U.S. News & World Report’s 2014 ranking, released Tuesday.
Several USC schools and programs were ranked among the top-10 schools. The report ranks both individual programs and schools nationally.
Both the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy and the Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy held onto their No. 1 rankings. The Division of Biokinesology and Physical Therapy has held this spot since 2004. The Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy has been No. 1 for 11 of the last 15 years.

The university’s medical programs were also recognized. The School of Pharmacy was ranked No. 10 and the Keck School of Medicine jumped up three places to No. 31.
The Price School of Public Policy received a No. 6 ranking among other schools with programs focused on public affairs. The Viterbi School of Engineering was ranked at No. 9.
Four additional graduate schools also made the report’s top 20: the School of Social Work at No. 11, the Rossier School of Education at No. 17, the Gould School of Law at No. 18 and the Viterbi’s Department of Computer Science Ph.D. program at No. 20.
USC also ranked in programs including earth sciences, business, fine arts, English literature, psychology, biological sciences and economics.
Though The Hollywood Reporter ranked the School of Cinematic Arts as No. 1 among other film schools in the country in 2012, the U.S. News & World Report ranking did not evaluate the school.
The report annually evaluates graduate programs in only business, law, medicine, engineering and education. This year, the report began ranking social sciences and humanities and library and information studies graduate programs, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Admission selectivity, job-placement statistics and expert opinions on the program are weighed into the decision ranking. More than 1,200 programs and nearly 15,000 academics and professionals were surveyed for the data during fall 2012 and early 2013.
Boy, what happend to the Business School?
Marshall’s MBA program hasn’t been ranked anywhere near the top in any recent year
The numbers you have generated for some of the rankings might be a little misleading. U.S. News updates the rankings every year for some schools and divisions; but not all of them.
The numbers for Biokinesiology, Occupational Therapy, Pharmacy, and Social Work reflect the rankings for 2012(information collected in 2011) so we are talking about old data. U.S. News publishes the data but explains in the methodology section that they are using old numbers. I think it is very important to share that information with your readers.

Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution Tuesday night that will add a new assembly with a focus on environmental issues into Program Board.
Deliberation · Undergraduate Student Government Parlimentarian Justin Farshidi and Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Arkfeld deliberate the addition of the Green Student Assembly to Program Board on Tuesday night. — Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The resolution, drafted by Residential Senator Sona Shah, Assistant Director of the Political Student Assembly Justin Bogda and the Director of university affairs and USG President-elect Christian Kurth, will recognize the Green Student Assembly as the ninth official assembly on the USC Program Board and will centralize the diverse environmental organizations at the university into one cohesive unit.
The eight other committees that fall under Program Board are the Academic Culture Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, International Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, Political Student Assembly, Latina/o Student Assembly, Queer and Ally Student Assembly and Women’s Student Assembly.
USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad said centralization can provide a solution to the problems that many organizations are currently facing.
“Right now we have several passionate environmental organizations on campus, but they don’t have a lot of visibility and are not funded as much as they are supposed to be,” Prasad said.
Groups such as Global Environmental Brigades, SC Outfitters and CALPIRG, for example, will be able to benefit by joining forces.
“A lot of them end up being smaller groups and not necessarily a cohesive unit,” Prasad said. “They just don’t have enough resources.”
SC Outfitters Will Getz, a junior majoring in chemistry and East Asian area studies, said GSA will give them a larger presence on campus.
“Being part of the assembly will give us more depth and involvement among other student organizations within Student Affairs and allow us to take a leadership role in the environment outside of the things we already do,” Getz said.
Prasad said the goal of competing with other Pac-12 schools also helped fuel the decision to draft the resolution.
“A majority of the schools we compete with have some sort of centralized organization for students that promotes sustainability efforts,” Prasad said. “We were kind of behind in that sense. For the last two or three years, people have been trying to find the best way to combat that issue on campus.”
Justin Bogda is confident that this unification will pave the way for an exciting future in sustainability projects for USC.
“There’s a real value in numbers and collaboration; environmentalism is all about unity,” Bogda said. “We won’t fix any environmental problems unless we get everybody in on the same initiatives and working toward the same common goal of cleaning up our environment.”
The GSA will receive funding from Program Board, which is supported by USG’s student-programming fee. Bogda said this extra funding will allow the GSA to reach new heights in on-campus sustainability efforts.
“The Green Student Assembly can plan and sponsor a variety of events working with both the community outside of USC and students in our community garden,” Bogda said.
Though many on Program Board expressed excitement over the newly formed assembly,  Christiana Morgenroth, a junior majoring in film and television production, said the centralization could lead to a decreased sense of individuality.
“I can imagine that, to put all these groups together to try to centralize them, certain goals that individual organizations may have wanted to achieve will fall by the wayside,” Morgenroth said. “Some compromise will be needed; larger goals will have a stronger backing [than smaller goals].”
Chapter Chair for USC CALPIRG Roshni Ashoj, however, said her organization is excited to collaborate with USC’s other green clubs.
“We at CALPIRG are really excited,” Ashoj said. “I don’t think [having different programs] will be an issue. All the organizations have similar goals. This will be more of a resource because we’re all working toward a sustainable and green future and we’d be helping each other out rather than taking away.”
Bogda said that financially, the groups within the GSA can maintain some independence. Within the GSA’s annual budget, which will  be used to plan events, member organizations can apply to receive individual funding. All the assembly’s member organizations can receive up to 25 percent of the assembly’s total funds.
Despite all the progress that has already occurred, both Prasad and Bogda acknowledge that more work needs to be done. Prasad said the trial program for the Green Student Assembly is slated to begin in the spring 2014 semester and be fully implemented in fall 2014.
Though it is still early, Bogda remains optimistic about the future of the Green Student Assembly and said it will infuse the campus with a new way of thinking.
“We will promote a culture of sustainability, of environmental awareness, both on campus and in the community,” Bogda said. “We want to change the way students think about the way they treat their waste, the way they consume product [and] the way they interact with the community around them.”
One of the Green Student Assembly’s first events will be observing Earth Week through a series of events beginning April 13. The series is dedicated to bringing environmental awareness to campus.

A panel of students, faculty and staff Tuesday offered solutions to improving the on-campus bike lanes, but did not reach any definite solutions.
The event was part of the Office of Campus Activities’ monthly Campus Conversation series held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Room 450. The panel was moderated by Associate Senior Vice President of the Career and Protective Services Charlie Lane and  drew a crowd of approximately 20 students.
Safety first · A student rides on Childs Way in the early afternoon. Some students and faculty want to expand the bike lanes around campus. — Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
The panelists, including student leaders and faculty and Dept. of Public Safety members, evaluated the effectiveness of the bike lanes. The bike lanes, which are a joint project by USC Student Affairs and the Undergraduate Student Government, were added on Trousdale Parkway at the beginning of the fall 2012 semester. The lanes stretch from McClintock to 34th streets, and are enforced Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. In a given day, there are approximately 12,000 bikes on campus, Lane said.
Alison Kendall, the principal architect of Kendall Planning + Design, the firm hired by USC, to assess possible solutions to bike collisions and parking problems, said bike lanes increase campus safety by regulate biker traffic.
“By providing a bike circulation and master plan on campus, we will be able to prevent many bike conflicts,” Kendall said. “Most cyclists on campus have never used a bike before coming to USC — that accounts for a lot of the problems we’re seeing now.”
All panelists acknowledged that, though the bike lanes were an effective first step, improvements still need to be made in regulating and enforcing them.
“Bikers like the bike lanes because they can move more efficiently than navigating through people. The issue that we’re seeing is the implementation of these lanes. It takes USC students a long time to adjust to these changes. This applies to both pedestrians and bikers,” USG President Mikey Geragos said.
Director of the Office for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Paula Swinford attributed the slow assimilation to these changes because of the mindset of young adults.
“It’s very hard to get an 18-year-old to follow the rules when the rules are flexible,” Swinford said. “They begin to think that the rules don’t matter unless [they] see DPS.”
Though Swinford believes the strict implementation is necessary, DPS Chief John Thomas said he does not want to enforce the bike lanes by handing out traffic citations.
“[DPS] purposefully doesn’t want to go down that path,” Thomas said. “It does have an impact because that provides order, but that’s not the ideal model. We prefer the culture to adhere to it. We’re just not at that point yet.”
Thomas also attributed the disinterest in citing students to the fact that patrolling the bike lanes is very time-consuming and expensive for the department.
Assistant Director of Campus Affairs Logan Heley, though not a fan of citations, said educating students about the rules was necessary for improving the bike lanes.
Heley and his committee are currently working on creating a section during freshman orientation where incoming students complete homework and watch a video about on-campus bicycle safety. Heley is also looking to start a bike student ambassador program where students patrol fellow students on the bike lanes.
Geragos agreed that, in some cases, peer regulation is more likely to change students’ habits than reprimands from DPS.
“Students have to make it their goal for other students to understand how the process is working,” Geragos said. “Once you see the system working as it’s supposed to, it benefits everyone involved. It’s our job as students to let them know that there are systems in place that they need to follow.”
Kendall panelists advocated to expand the bike lanes around campus to extend the uniformity of the policy, while other panelists, like Swinford, thought setting limits on the amount of bikes on campus was the best course of action.
“It would be very convenient for me to park my car in front my building, but I don’t because there’s rules about that,” Swinford said. “If there were more rules about bikes we could really see a shift among students.”
Many students had mixed reactions about regulating bike lanes in the coming semesters. Camille Wu, a junior majoring in public policy, management and business, said she believes biking will continue to be an integral aspect of the university’s culture, even if the bike lanes are regulated.
“Biking is an important and healthy lifestyle choice,” said Wu, who rode a bike last semester but does not ride it as frequently now. “Creating a campus that is both bicycle-safe and pedestrian-friendly can help contribute to that. That’s something that the campus should emphasize.”
Some students said the bike lanes could not easily be implemented with just educational tools.
“It’s not an education issue. Instead it’s an experience and reinforcement issue,” said Alex Elavitt, a Ph.D. candidate in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism communication program who commutes to campus on bike. “There are different bike cultures on campus: those who regularly bike on the road versus cruising bikers. Cruisers are the ones who cause issues and collide with others.”
Though many students spoke from a daily on-campus perspective, one of the most passionate audience member reactions did not come from a student. Otto Khera, the senior manager of research and evaluation at the Center for Scholarly Technology, noted that the regulation of bike lanes served an important function on campus, but it should not come at the expense of encouraging greater bike movement off-campus.
“I hope we don’t lose sight of what our civic responsibility is. USC students are the most courteous and professional students out there — except when it comes to biking,” Khera said. “There’s a sea of change out there: The number of bikers is growing, the city is adding more bike lanes and if we really try we can show everyone that even in the most unlikely place — the center of busy L.A. — bikes can thrive in here as well.”
We need more bike lanes and bike racks please!
Racks belong below your neck line and not on the ground with a tire stuck in it
Rather than addressing the bike “problem” on campus, I want to hear if the university has anything to say about the growing police presence the surrounding neighborhood ticketing bikers. At least once a month (typically at the end of the month), bike cops are stationed at the corner of Orchard and 30th Street, ticketing students who do not come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I understand that it’s the law to come to a stop but I do not think it is an appropriate allocation of resources and that LAPD is taking advantage of stereotypically wealthy students with these tickets. 
In addition, this morning, 6 LAPD and 2 DPS officers were stationed at the corner of Jefferson and McClintok forcing bikers to get off their bikes and walk them across the intersection. Once again, I understand that it is the law but this seems an even bigger waste of police and university resources. And it’s not even the end of the with LAPD trying to meet some sort of quota…
@ Annoyed,
The law is the law!
In a given day, there are approximately 12,000 bikes on campus, Lane said.  The quality of life and safety of the University suffers because so many uncaring and irresponsible bicycle riders (not cyclists) that flood the area.  
I hope LAPD and DPS send more officers to instill some common sense and pick up bloody students after they crash and collide with each other, vehicles, and pedestrians.
When are we getting that floating monorail they always promised?
Peer regulation… yes!

A one-person comedy show is a slippery slope of potential for either success, or disaster. Since there is only one performer on stage, there is absolutely no distraction for the audience if the jokes are falling flat, or if said performer messes up their routine.
Dayna Dooley, star of DAYNALAND, scrambles from scene to scene playing a variety of different and quirky characters. — Courtesy of Sandra Kuker
Considering how difficult it is to perform in a solo show, it is impressive that Dayna Dooley, an actress, singer, spokesmodel and writer native to Southern California, had the courage to create her very own one-woman show titled Daynaland. The show is advertised as a “trip to the nuttiest place on earth”, and is designed to showcase Dooley’s comedic versatility by having her portray nine distinctly different female characters from around the world. The show also claims to “merge the power of digital media with the intimacy and spontaneity of live theatre”.
 The problem with these claims is that they are not fulfilled in the show. Although Dooley clearly put a lot of heart and effort into her performance, the whole thing did not tie together the way a successful one-person piece of theatre should.
For starters, the advertised “media” aspect of the show consisted of three painted theatre flats onto which a series of pre-recorded videos were projected intermittently throughout the performance. Indeed, the opening of the show was a pre-recorded video of Dooley as an “incompetent tour guide” character that introduced the audience to the different woman and locations right before the new skit would begin. Later on, once a skit would end, the projection would show the previous character appearing on the screen, and vaguely interacting with all of the other characters that came before her.
The issue with this technique was the fact that it detracted, rather than added, to the show. It was a very interesting concept, but unfortunately the conversations that the characters had amongst themselves on the screen were stilted, awkward, and were quite visibly just a time-filler, while Dooley changed into her next costume.
 In addition, this use of technology brought with it an awkward number of technical errors. From backgrounds not loading fast enough, to the mouse cursor still being visible on screen, the whole thing felt unrehearsed and unprofessional.
The late, lengthy and noisy set-changes did little to help detract from these mistakes. Lighting operator Ray Taylor Smith was either late for his cues, or seemed to forget when to turn the lights on and off – often leaving the crew to fumble around the stage in darkness, or rather fleeing offstage as the main lights were turned on before they were supposed to.
These mistakes led to an alienating effect during the character transitions, and the momentum and aura of theatrically suspended disbelief that each skit had previously gained was quickly lost.
This was unfortunate, as many of the skits were not as strong as they should have been for a professional performance at such an esteemed venue, as the Stella Adler Theatre. Though Dooley clearly put a lot of energy and passion into her work, the overall effect was unfortunately not a successful one.
For starters, Dooley utilized different accents and dialects to coincide with the “travelling” concept of the show. Unfortunately, her accents kept failing at random moments during her performance, and were merely caricatures of accents, rather than the proper versions of executing them. Also, though Dooley’s characters were technically “distinct” from each other in that they dressed differently, talked about different subject matters and had unique quirks about them, ultimately Dooley seemed to be playing a different variation of the same person. Her jokes, catchphrases and scenarios were all very repetitive – going from phrases like “Don’t you judge me” to simple repetitions of “I did, mhm I did tell you”. The first few times, these sassy turn of phrases were very funny and effective, but after hearing them over and over throughout different sketches, the humor got old very quickly.
Accompanying this repetitive nature of the show, Dooley also lacked a sense of balance in her performances. While she did have a good and noticeable stage presence, Dooley seemed to lose focus.
The final baffling aspect of the show was the sudden switch from stand-up comedy style characters and subjects to subjects and characters of a much more serious, and dark nature. With no warning or effective transition, Dooley jumped from a funny, ridiculous stripper character, to playing a mentally handicapped girl talking about how she wished to be “normal”. This sudden, stark contrast would have been believable and powerful had there been an underlying theme to the show, but since the characters weren’t linked to each other in any regard, these sudden mood shifts were graceless at best, and slightly offensive at worst.
Now, it’s a shame that the whole of the show did not play out the way that Dooley envisioned it, considering her obvious talent and passion for her work. In an interview after the show, Dooley even mentioned her struggles and continual perseverance in the face of rejection in regards to this show.
“LA and this business is all no, no, no,” said Dooley as she tearfully thanked her producer Derrick D. Pete for believing in her and helping her finance the show.
And even though the entirety of the performance did not quite click and flow, it did contain some golden highlights that were both funny and impressive. For example, Dooley elicited many laughs from her portrayal of sassy stripper proudly bragging about her children’s future stripping careers, as well as showed off her incredible operatic range whilst playing a diva opera-singer.
Perhaps with a bit more focus, less jitteriness and nervousness on stage, and a lot more rehearsal (especially on the side of the crew), Daynaland could truly live up to its potential. Either way, it’s truly an experience within itself.

The USC women’s lacrosse team, in its first home game in nearly three weeks, hopes to recover from a close road loss to No. 18 Stanford as it prepares to take on Temple on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field.
Playing well · Freshman Caroline Cordrey (above) finished with a game-high four goals in USC’s 17-12 loss against No. 18 Stanford. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After opening their inaugural season with four home games, including a matchup against No. 4 Northwestern at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to start their season, the Women of Troy (4-4, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) have been competing on the road, alternating between wins and losses to finish 2-2 on the road trip.
Following a 12-7 win over UC Davis (1-4, 0-3 MPSF) led by five goals from USC freshman midfield Amanda Johansen, the Women of Troy lost 17-12 to No. 18 Stanford (4-2, 1-0 MPSF) on March 8.
USC was able to outscore the Cardinal 8-6 in the second half but suffered its first conference loss despite four goals by freshman attack Caroline Cordrey and five points (three goals, two assists) from freshman attack Caroline de Lyra.
The Women of Troy are 2-1 at McAlister Field this season, having won their last two home games against Presbyterian (1-6) and Saint Mary’s College (2-3, 1-3 MPSF) by a combined 29 goals. They hope to take down a Temple team (4-1) that is coming off its first loss in its first away game of the season, a 14-10 defeat to Stanford.
“Everyone’s excited to not be traveling anymore,” freshman defense Courtney Tarleton said. “It’s really exhausting being on plane rides the whole time, so it feels good to finally be playing back in California.”
De Lyra leads the Women of Troy in points (49), goals (28) and assists (21). Johansen has 21 goals on the season along with nine ground balls and 51 draw controls, while Cordrey has scored 19 goals, including two game-winners and seven free-position goals in 10 attempts. USC as a team is outscoring its opponents 115-98, scoring a goal on almost half of its shots and is currently 4-1 against unranked opponents.
The Owls, who are in the middle of a three-game road trip in California, are led by Kellee Pace’s 11 goals, while Charlott Swavola and Jaymie Tabor have 10 goals each. They are outscoring their opponents 65-45 on the season.
“Temple’s a really phenomenal team,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “They’re playing really well this season. We’re just excited at the opportunity to try and improve from our Stanford game. We didn’t start the game off as well as we would like to, and the second half showed we can compete, so it’s just really a matter for us to come out and play for a full 60 minutes. That’s our focus going into the game.”
After they take on Temple, the Women of Troy have another home game at McAlister Field on Saturday against Marquette (2-3) at noon, then they travel to Rhode Island to face Bryant (1-3) on Tuesday, March 19.

The Pac-12 tournament is here. For USC and a handful of other teams, it represents a last-ditch effort at a Cinderella run to March Madness. For the five squads currently in position to make the NCAA tournament — the Arizona Wildcats, UCLA Bruins, Cal Golden Bears, Colorado Buffaloes and Oregon Ducks — it’s basically bracket posturing and bragging rights.
In other words, the Trojans have significantly more to play for than their higher-seeded counterparts. USC has shown an ability to compete with anyone in the conference, beating the Bruins and Wildcats and falling to the Ducks in overtime. Technically speaking, they have a shot at pulling off a major upset and running the table against the rest of the Pac-12. Only the Utah Utes, Oregon State Beavers and Washington State Cougars are essentially dead on arrival in terms of making that improbable feat a reality.
But in the real world? It’s not going to happen for the Trojans.
In fact, not even USC’s opening-round game against 10th-seeded Utah is a gimme. That has nothing to do with the indefinite suspensions of redshirt junior forward Dewayne Dedmon and senior center James Blasczyk. No, it has more to do with the fact that the Trojans really haven’t played very well of late.
They pulled off the massive upset over Arizona, no doubt an impressive win. But, they’ve lost four of six after a four-game winning streak, and the blowout loss to last-place Washington State to end the regular season was far from an encouraging sign.
Realistically, the Trojans’        Pac-12 tournament path features a solid win over the Utes followed by a double-digit loss to the second-seeded Golden Bears. USC doesn’t need Dedmon to beat Utah, despite the fact that he turned in a 13-point, 13-rebound, five-block performance in their last matchup. Utah just isn’t a very good basketball team and Dedmon isn’t consistent enough to be counted on for a repeat of that statline, anyway.
But, assuming senior point guard Jio Fontan keeps his turnovers to a minimum and junior J.T. Terrell provides his usual scoring punch, USC should be able to take down Utah. It might be a nail-biter, but I expect the Trojans to take care of business because they’re simply more talented.
After that, things don’t look so hot. Cal defeated USC in both meetings this season, including a 76-68 come-from-behind victory that ended the Trojans’ winning streak. The Golden Bears have the Pac-12 player of the year in junior guard Allen Crabbe, who averaged 18.6 points and six rebounds per game this season.
The closest sort of player USC can counter with is Terrell, who is playing much better lately but still lacks Crabbe’s level of consistency. Cal is also coming into the tournament on a hot streak, winning seven of its last eight games.
In the NFL, it’s tough to beat the same team three times in one year. The same can’t be said in college athletics. Either you’re capable of pulling off an upset or you’re not. USC is capable, but the numbers are stacked against them.
Second-tier Pac-12 squads, such as Arizona State, Stanford and Washington, are in the same boat. And though the Pac-12 as a whole really isn’t too top-heavy, I still don’t foresee many upsets in the mix. Top-seeded UCLA will beat the winner of No. 8-seed Stanford vs. No. 9-seed Arizona State. Arizona won’t have much trouble on its side of the bracket.
Cal and Oregon would most certainly be vulnerable against Colorado, Arizona State or Stanford, but they’ve got easier matchups against the winner of USC/Utah and Washington/Washington State, respectively.
It’s the easy thing to say, but I expect the Pac-12 tournament to be decided among its top-four seeds — UCLA against Arizona, Cal against Oregon. From there, I’d look for the Wildcats to upend an inexperienced Bruins squad and for Cal to take down the slumping Ducks, who ended the regular season with back-to-back losses.
The Pac-12 championship game will then come down to Arizona’s ability to slow down Crabbe: He exploded for 31 points in a 77-69 road victory over the Wildcats on Feb. 10. I expect Arizona will do a significantly better job in that department (and that Crabbe won’t shoot 12-of-15 again), and the Wildcats will take the conference title in pretty comfortable fashion.
If Arizona is able to take down UCLA and Cal, it could do wonders for the team’s seeding in the NCAA tournament. ESPN’s Joe Lunardi currently lists the Wildcats as a five-seed, but if they win the Pac-12, look for them to be in contention for a third or fourth seed.
As for USC, nothing short of a miraculous run would put the team in contention for even an NIT appearance. The Trojans can take solace in their significant strides from last season, though, as well as the fact that Pac-12 teams like Arizona have a very real chance at making some March Madness noise.

We should learn fom the cross-town rival to do what should be done ,
(1) In football. They hire in a new  coach. Tough coaching in the warm San Bernandino. Good discipline. No fancy recruits. They move up to the Top 20 at the end of the season. Still, they are humble. Watch for them in the coming season.
As for us, we are not even rated.
(2) In basketball. They have good records. But they make changes in coaching when needed. A day ago, they had fired the coach. And this man wins more games than our last two coaches in 10 years.
As for us, we have good players. And we just do not play good ball. Finally we decided to find another coach.
When will we learn to do what is best for our players ?

The USC football team took the field for practice Tuesday without incumbent sophomore quarterback Max Wittek and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee. Both players suffered knee injuries on Saturday and were forced to sit out of the weekend scrimmage, but head coach Lane Kiffin is optimistic about both players returning to practice before next week.
“[The injuries] are not serious,” Kiffin said. “We anticipate both of them being back, if not this week, then the next two days of practice.”

Wittek tried to make the best of his time off the practice field and focused on improving other aspects of his game.
“I’m going to try to spend as much time mentally with my teammates, a lot more film work with individual players,” Wittek said.
The absence of Wittek in particular was an intriguing wrinkle in the battle for the starting quarterback job. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler and incoming freshman quarterback Max Browne were given additional reps in Wittek’s stead, to                  mixed results.
Browne in particular struggled, throwing two interceptions to safety and fellow freshman Su’a Cravens during 11-on-11 drills. Browne said his miscues were a result of the speed of the game and the learning curve in transitioning from high school to the college level. On some plays, it seemed Browne checked down without going through his progressions.
“Every single play, your head’s spinning … and you’re thinking so much,” Browne said. “Once I get comfortable with the offense I don’t think it’ll happen.”
Browne was not the only player struggling in practice — the entire team looked beleaguered following their first full practice in pads.
“[Tuesday was] unfortunately not one of our better practices,” Kiffin said. “It’s easy to come out energized the first two days of spring without pads. … Today was a little warmer, and being out in full pads for a long practice was good for us, good for our guys to realize that obviously we have a long way to go.”
One of the few bright spots of the practice was the play of Cravens, whose on-field intensity translated into two interceptions. Cravens, who stands 6-foot-3 and weighs in at a solid 220 pounds, has been described as looking like a college senior by assistant coaches. His play also resembles that of a more experienced player, a fact Cravens attributes to new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s system.
“When you’re thinking too much, you play slow,” Cravens said. “The playbook’s really simple, and [Pendergast] keeps it really easy for us to not think too much and just play.”
Kiffin was especially pleased with Cravens’ play and mentality, comparing his drive and quick jump on the learning curve to that of former Trojan standout wide receiver Robert Woods and cornerback Nickell Robey.
“[Cravens] is just so natural,” Kiffin said. “He went from making the two interceptions, one off the deep post and one off the edge just beating the back. He’s a special player.”
With the departure of senior safety T.J. McDonald and Robey to the NFL draft, Cravens’ early play is an encouraging development for a defense that seeks to adopt a new identity in the coming season.

The numbers are disturbing, to say the least. In USC’s last six games heading into its matchup Tuesday night with Pepperdine, the Trojan pitching staff had amassed an abysmal 6.12 ERA.
Make that a 6.41 ERA in their last seven games.
USC suffered another bullpen implosion Tuesday evening against Pepperdine, surrendering eight runs out of their bullpen in a 9-4 loss to the Waves, its sixth loss in the last seven games.
“It’s almost like flipping a coin,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said of the inconsistency in the bullpen. “You don’t know which guy you’re gonna get when you bring him in. Because they’ve all performed well at one point, but they’ve all performed poorly, too.”
In their opening nine games of the season, the Trojan pitching staff was stellar, putting up a 2.96 ERA over 82 impressive innings. But since then, their ERA has ballooned to 4.31, and their record has correspondingly dropped from 6-3 to 7-9.
Most of the Trojans’ struggles on the mound have come out of their youthful bullpen. As Hubbs is fond of pointing out, USC has had only had three poor starts in its 16 games this year. But of the six pitchers to have seen significant time out of the ‘pen this year, four are underclassmen and three are freshman. While each have dazzled at times, including during the recent rough stretch, they have also struggled through bouts of tremendous inconsistency.
“It’s a confidence thing,” sophomore pitcher Nigel Nootbaar said. “I know they have good stuff — these freshman have a lot of talent. They just have to trust their stuff and throw strikes.”
Against Pepperdine, freshman starter Brent Wheatley lasted just two innings. He allowed one unearned run but was wildly erratic and removed in favor of fellow freshman Marc Huberman. One of the more reliable relievers for USC in the past week, Huberman let up two runs over three innings, allowing Pepperdine to tie the game at three apiece.
Later, fellow freshman Kyle Davis came in and was smacked around. He gave up five runs on four hits — including a double and a homer — over just two-thirds of an inning, and also walked and hit a batter.
“Our pitchers really just have to trust themselves to throw strikes,” sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs said, echoing the comments of Nootbaar. “I know as a hitter that with runners on base, it’s up to the pitcher to throw strikes. And our pitchers have to trust that if they get the ball over the plate, they’ll get guys out.”
As Stubbs can attest to, for all of the Trojans’ struggles on the mound, they have scuffled almost as much at the plate. USC had nine hits to Pepperdine’s 10, but the Waves outscored the Trojans by five. That discrepancy has become somewhat of a trend in recent games for USC. On Sunday, UCLA outhit the Trojans 10-5 and outscored them by a margin of 6-1. A week ago against Cal State Fullerton, the Titans outhit USC 15-10, but outscored them 11-4.
“Let the game come to you, that’s what we have to do,” Hubbs said. “We can’t press at the plate, especially with runners on. It seems like we have a few guys hitting really well, but they’re always the ones on base and we can’t bring them in.”

Looking to extend its winning ways, the USC women’s tennis team took down the University of Texas at Marks Stadium with a 7-0 victory on Tuesday afternoon.
The Women of Troy opened up the match in strong fashion during the doubles point against a better-than-advertised Longhorn team.
“This has to be the most under-ranked team of all-time,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said of Texas. “They’re really talented, but they just haven’t got out of the blocks. And going back to when they played in the National Team Indoors, you can lose three [games] and that’s what Texas did. … There goes the confidence and momentum you have.”
Although USC swept through the doubles round easily with all three teams winning their respective matches, Texas showed off the talent of a top program early on.
The Longhorns (3-7) came out firing in the singles’ round as sophomore Zoë Scandalis dropped the first game without notching a point against sophomore Noel Scott. Scandalis would recover from her early deficit to take hold of the first set by a 6-1 margin, but Scott bounced back to steal the second set 6-4.
In the only three-set match of the day, Scandalis took the last two games to close out the set (and the match) by a 6-4 score.
“I was proud of our girls that we didn’t come out asleep, and we came to play today,” Gallien said.
The bottom part of the singles’ matches provided USC with the early win with slots four through six all winning.
Junior Gabriella DeSimone faced off against Elizabeth Begley and quickly found herself in a 3-0 hole in the first set. DeSimone turned the set with her hustle and determination and won the six-straight points to close out the set 6-3.
The junior finished off Begley in the second set by the same 6-3 margin to add to USC’s point total.
“They are a good team and the record doesn’t show how good they are, so we knew we had to come out here firing,” DeSimone said. “We had a tough couple of weeks, including our match last week against UCLA, so it’s good to get back on top.”
Sophomore Giuliana Olmos may have been at a height disadvantage against 5-foot-11 sophomore Lina Padegimaite, but it didn’t show on the court. Olmos, who has been tough to beat so far this season, won the match on court five by a score of 6-1, 6-3.
“I played her in the doubles match, so I got a feel for her game,” Olmos said of her opponent. “Our match was a lot closer than the score, with most of our matches going to deuce. I knew that I had to stay tough during the big points to pull it out.“
Last week’s Pac-12 player of the week, freshman Ellie Yates, did her job in the six spot with her 6-2, 6-0 defeat of Texas’ Lana Groenvynck.
Speaking of awards, sophomore Sabrina Santamaria was named this week’s Pac-12 player of the week and she put in a great comeback effort to topple Texas’ Breaunna Addison on court two.
Struggling with her form early on in the match, Santamaria continued to battle back despite being down for the entire first set. The sophomore rallied to force a tiebreaker against Addison, which she proceeded to win easily to win the set. From then on, Santamaria took control of the match and finished the second set with a 6-0 sweep.
Senior Danielle Lao had a hard-fought match in singles against Texas’ lone senior, Aeriel Ellis. The two upperclassmen were battling shot for shot throughout the two sets with the momentum shifting with each point.
The country’s No. 8 player prevailed, though, as Lao finished the match strong and completed a 6-4, 6-4 victory to complete the 7-0 win over Texas.
With a weekend slate featuring Pac-12 opponents Colorado and Utah, USC will look to continue its strong start in Pac-12 play.

Crazy seems to be the new normal for the USC men’s basketball team. Whether it be a stunning road win over UCLA or a jarring 25-point loss to Pac-12 bottom-dweller Washington State to conclude the regular season, there have been few instances where the Trojans have lived up to their “average” 9-9 conference record.
Leadership needed · Senior point guard Jio Fontan scored 13 points in USC’s last meeting against Utah. With the suspensions of big men Dewayne Dedmon and James Blasczyk, the Trojans will again turn to their guards. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
This might just be good thing, since the Trojans (14-17, 9-9 in Pac-12 play) will need a performance that is nothing short of special to find success this week, as they head to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 tournament.
USC earned the seventh seed in the tournament and will face the 10th-seeded Utah Utes (13-17, 5-13 in Pac-12) in the first round on Wednesday at 6 p.m. USC is all but certain to miss the NCAA tournament, unless it wins four games in four days to take home the Pac-12 championship.
“We’ve proven that we can play and beat the best teams in the conference,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “We’ve beaten UCLA, we’ve beaten Arizona and I like our path in the tournament [and] our bracket. We’re just gonna take it one game at a time and see what happens on Wednesday with Utah.“
USC will need to narrow its focus this week after the school indefinitely suspended senior center James Blasczyk and junior forward Dewayne Dedmon from all team activities on Monday for violating a team rule. Cantu confirmed Monday that both will not play against Utah, but their statuses, if USC wins and advances, has not yet been determined. USC players were not made available to the media following Monday’s practice, the final session at the Galen Center before the Trojans left for Vegas Tuesday morning.
Blasczyk has played sparingly (seven minutes per game), but Dedmon leads the Trojans with seven rebounds per game to go with 2.1 blocks per contest, the third-highest total in                           the Pac-12. The loss of the two 7-footers leaves USC with 7-foot-2 junior Omar Oraby as the only center left on the roster. Oraby is playing just 13.9 minutes per game, but could double that if the big man out of Cairo avoids foul trouble. Conditioning is also an issue, but Cantu is making preparations.
“[Oraby will] use those timeouts, use those free throws and dead balls to catch his breath and be able to play a lot more minutes than he’s been playing,” Cantu said.
The Trojans defeated Utah     76-59 in Salt Lake City in January, a game that turned out to be former USC head coach Kevin O’Neill’s last before his firing on Jan. 14. The Trojans shot 50 percent from the field in that game while limiting the Utes to a 37.5 percent clip.
USC’s leading scorer in Utah was junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell, who also poured in 18 points in the 76-51 loss at Washington State.
The Wake Forest transfer is averaging 16 points over USC’s past seven games, shooting 43.6 percent from the field in those contests after making just 34.6 percent of his tries during USC’s first 24 games. His 2.5 3-pointers per game in conference play lead the Pac-12.
A step up in performance will be needed from senior forward Eric Wise. Along with senior point guard Jio Fontan, Wise was named Pac-12 honorable mention on Monday. But the UC Irvine transfer scored just seven points in each of USC’s losses at Washington and Washington State, shooting 25 percent on the two-game trip.
Fontan, as he has been all season, will be relied upon to run the point and make the sort of crisp passes that helped him finish second in the Pac-12 with 5.2 assists per game.
O’Neill constantly praised USC’s depth before the season, and USC’s new eight-man rotation will need to adjust to take over Blasczyk and Dedmon’s combined 29.3 minutes per game.
“That’s the good thing about our team, having talent [and] having depth,” Cantu said. “Other guys have opportunities, and they need to step up and play.”
Cantu mentioned senior forwards Aaron Fuller and Renaldo Woolridge as the candidates to receive increased playing time to fill in for the void in the post.
If the Trojans defeat Utah, they will play on Thursday evening against the second-seeded Cal Golden Bears, who beat the Trojans in both of the team’s meetings this season.
Boo Trojans. You’d think they’d change their name, too, since its more commonly associated with condoms than an ancient civilization.

Since the beginning of the entertainment industry, there have always been celebrities that just can’t seem to keep themselves out of trouble. Certain artists court controversy as often as they court producers, and some even end up making a career based more on bad press than actual talent.
Seemingly living by the ethos of “there’s no such thing as bad press,” the celebrities in this week’s New Noise have had their fair share of public beef with other celebrities, but still manage to drop some pretty great tracks every now and then. Now that’s some serious multitasking.
Ghostface Killah: “The Sure Shot (Parts 1 & 2)”
The crazy-talented Ghostface Killah has made his own name in the music world, with his solo efforts being just as lauded as his work with the Wu-Tang Clan. The rapper also has been involved in a couple of incidents, including with Biggie, Mase (remember him?) and 50 Cent. His most recent effort is a collaborative album with producer/Renaissance man Adrian Younge entitled Twelve Reasons to Die. The record is produced by fellow Clan member RZA and is set for release on April 16. The second single dropped from the album so far is “The Sure Shot (Parts 1 & 2),” a double-bomb song for the price of one. The two-part track is a mini-drama in and of itself — Part 1 is a resplendent intro that conjures up an image of a red carpet being rolled out, while Part 2 shoots out with dramatic keys that let you know that Mr. Killah has officially arrived. The beat just doesn’t quit and the cymbal-heavy percussion actually sounds real, as opposed to sounding like it was created by the push of a button. Ghostface’s flow is furious as usual and he rhymes words before you can even digest what he said. I’d hate to be told off by the guy.

Drake: “5AM in Toronto”
The Canadian rapper first gained fame playing Jimmy Brooks (aka Wheelchair Jimmy) on Degrassi: The Next Generation. Since his first EP in 2009, Drake has enjoyed huge success in the music world, but not without a load of beef so big that it might as well be a steak. The guy has had so many issues with other celebrities that he has his own feuds section on Wikipedia. That’s when you know you’ve made it.
Pusha T, Common, Ludacris, Chris Brown and Charlamagne Tha God (is that seriously someone’s handle?) comprise the lucky guys that made Drake’s page. Drake must’ve “eenie meenie miny moe”-ed his way to Chris Brown recently, because that’s who he’s dredging up new fighting words for in his new track, “5AM in Toronto.”
The song is produced by Boi-1da and features his usual idiosyncratic and confident flow. The beat is the star of the track: heavy, hollow and hard-hitting, banging against a booming bass that holds up Drake’s raps. There’s a borderline-raver synth in the background, but somehow it works with the resonating beat and ends up being the perfect accompaniment. There are a few lyrics that are raising eyebrows for their Chris Brown/Rihanna implications, along with lines that seem to refer to Common, The Weeknd and even MTV’s recent “Hottest MC” list. “5AM in Toronto:” when the dissing happens.

Lupe Fiasco: “Light Blue”
Perhaps Lupe Fiasco takes the crown in this round as the most controversial artist. After all, the other celebs featured here beefed with other celebs — Fiasco has been taking on the President of the United States, and that definitely requires a special kind of audacity.
Most recently, heads everywhere were being furiously scratched at the fact that Fiasco, who famously told CBS in 2011 that “the biggest terrorist is Obama in the United States of America,” was booked for performing at an Obama inauguration bash in Washington, D.C. What’s weirder is that Fiasco actually showed up and performed.
But of course, in true Fiasco style, he did his anti-war song “Words I Never Said” for 30 minutes, throwing in some serious shade to the POTUS. After going on an anti-Obama bluster-rap for some time, Fiasco was finally escorted off the stage and, thankfully, he’s bringing his focus back to music as of late.
Fiasco goes hard in “Light Blue,” a song with a menacing confidence that has background music made for an X-Files episode. The slimy melting synth in the background is the perfect contrast to the chopped up chorus and gives the track its serious flair. Lupe’s upcoming album Testuo & Youth is to be released sometime this year, but “Light Blue” is not off the LP.

Ciara: “Body Party”
And now for something completely different! Ciara rose to fame in 2004 by “1-2 Step”-ing into all of our hearts, but she hasn’t been bulletproof from the rumor mill, either. The singer has been rumored to have beefed with Keri Hilson, Beyoncé and Rihanna (common denominator much?).
The Ciara-Rihanna beef seemed to have been filed away, but recently it fired up again with a picture Rihanna posted on her Instagram of her and her friends apparently laughing at a video of Ciara doing an a cappella version of “Body Party.” Sounds pretty tame (and lame), and thankfully Ciara hasn’t fed the flames yet.
“Body Party” is actually a delectable trip down the ’90s R&B lane. The song features a slow-mo sample of Ghost Town DJ’s classic hit “My Boo” and was produced by Mike WiLL Made It (who needs a new name). The sound is a vintage R&B bedroom song, sounding like it could be a B-side to something off of Janet Jackson’s Velvet Rope. The song has minimal autotune, which makes the track sound even more ’90s and authentic.
There are times that Ciara’s vocals suggest that the melody is a key or two too high for her range, but the perfect sampling and retro vibe of the song make up for any slights. If “Body Party” was a TV show, it’d be one of those programs that was only played after 11 p.m. on Friday nights. And I mean that in the most non-greasy way possible.

In a way, the grand opening of LA Spice is a homecoming for owner LeAnne Schwartz. Though new to the cafe scene, Schwartz has been serving up casual gourmet food to Angelenos for 25 years under her catering company of the same name.

Schwartz, who is used to hosting the party, said it was a pleasant surprise to have longtime customers and associates flock to the newly christened cafe to lend their support and spread the word about the cafe’s fresh California cuisine and relaxed environment.
“Twice today, old customers and business associates have come in,” Schwratz said. “It’s almost like having my own party; so many people have been coming by.”
One of those customers, Sharon Terrell-Brown, has known Schwartz for 32 years. She even had her wedding (and her daughter’s) catered by Schwartz.
“Her flavors are the best. She always has something different,” Terrell-Brown said. “Every time she had a party, people would come for the party, but they stayed for the food.”
Schwartz said she got the idea to open a cafe after she started looking into moving her catering business closer to her house. The space in Culver City she found was great, but was larger than what she needed for the catering company. Rather than look elsewhere or consider subletting though, she was struck with a better idea.
“I thought, ‘What if we opened a restaurant at the same time?’” Schwartz said. “It wasn’t a big business plan — we just had extra space — and I’d always wanted to do this.”
LA Spice’s menu features a selection as diverse as the city. The menu transitions seamlessly from a garden goat-cheese omelet with asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes to curried chicken croissants topped with currants, toasted walnuts and Fuji apple-curry dressing.
“We’re talking California cuisine with all of the fresh farmers market ingredients,” Schwartz said. “We have so many things here that they don’t have anywhere else. We want to bring those fresh foods in with all of the different styles and influences and then make them ours.”
Schwartz, a Los Angeles native who worked the hamburger stands on the pier at Redondo Beach in high school, said she developed a passion for cuisine at an early age.
“I grew up doing a lot of baking and cooking at home. My mom was always interested in whatever was new,” Schwartz said. “[Anything] new and fun and just with a lot of California influences like tacos or whatever Asian cuisine was coming in style. She’d try out everything.”
To help her bring this casual gourmet vision to LA Spice, Schwartz recruited Executive Chef Joachim Weritz, a classically trained chef who uses his expertise to give everyday California cuisine an upgrade.
He takes basic cafe staples and makes them feel like something celebrities in Malibu would munch on. His The Adult Not PB & J for example is a far cry from what your mother used to put in your lunch box, incorporating a home-made nut butter (a mix of pistachio, chia, hemp seed, flax seed, cashews and almonds) smeared atop a generous spread of pinot noir grape jam.
For Weritz, the most important thing for him is to incorporate fresh,  local food. He makes it a point to visit the Culver City or Santa Monica markets at least once a week and also plans to vary LA Spice’s menu based on the season, with the spring menu, set to debut on March 21.
Currently, he said one of his favorite options on the menu is Ariba Chilaquiles.
“It’s the perfect hangover dish if you’re a little tipsy. We make it with very fresh corn tortillas, fresh guajillo salsa, which is mild but very flavorful, a Mexican fried egg on top with red onions. Delicious,” Weritz said.
True to its varied, Los Angeles roots, the cafe also caters to those who eat gluten-free, which is important for manager Chiara Issa-O’Connell.
“The worst is going to a bakery in the morning knowing you’re not going to get a donut or a muffin because it’s not gluten-free,” Issa-O’Connell said.
Even the cafe’s decor embodies Southern California style, capturing a laid-back, yet sophisticated feel. Still, the interior is as much a reflection on Schwartz as it is on Los Angeles.
“I’m a casual person in my life. I like my jeans and my T-shirts and sweaters,” Schwartz said. “For me, this is a place where you can come, meet friends and have a delicious dining experience.”
Fittingly, the cafe has a warm and inviting feel to it, with soft yellow walls and big open windows, which overlook Culver City’s main drag. It’s the little details though, such as the zinc tables, which have a softer feel than stainless steel, or the different types of chairs, which are painted in orange to make them feel unique yet aesthetically pleasing, that give the restaurant a sense of character and space.
Comfortable environments like this are sustained by loyal clientele, of which Terrell-Brown promises to be. For her first visit, she ordered LA Spice’s Indian Spinach soup. She paused a moment to savor the broth before settling on her verdict.
“It’s delicious,” she said with a smile. “Nice and spicy.”
Is there a reason why the article doesn’t give the location of the place reviewed?

Pilot. Doctor. Lawyer. Real-life con man Frank Abagnale Jr. managed to trick his way into all three of these occupations before he could legally vote.
Jack of all trades · Stephen Anthony plays Frank Abagnale Jr. in Catch Me If You Can. While evading the FBI, Abagnale takes on many different identities including a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor. — Courtesy of Carol Rosegg
 
Needless to say, Abagnale didn’t lead a quiet life and fittingly, Catch Me If You Can, which opens its doors at the Pantages Theatre on March 12, takes his unbelievable story and translates it perfectly into the glitz and glam of a Broadway musical.
For those unfamiliar with the plot, Abagnale Jr. decides to run away from home at the age of 16 following his parents’ divorce. As he makes a new life for himself as a check-forging con artist, he finds love in Brenda Strong (Aubrey Mae Davis), a co-worker he met when he was impersonating a doctor, and forges a dear friendship with the FBI agent determined to track him down to put him in prison.
Abagnale’s unbelievably true story was first made popular in a 2002 film of the same name, starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. Though audiences might be skeptical about paying for a show that already garnered success as a movie, actor Ben Laxton, who plays Agent Dollar, one of the officers on the manhunt for Frank, said that the Broadway show gives a new flair to the now-classic story.
“The show gives us the opportunity to break the fourth wall and talk to the audience,” Laxton said. “We hit the main events, but as an audience member you feel like you’re a part of the con in a way.”
Laxton, who also serves as the understudy for Frank, said playing Frank is no easy task.
“Frank is the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Laxton said. “He almost never leaves the stage, he sings almost every song,” he said. “It’s amazing to watch Stephen [Anthony] do it every single night so consistently … Putting it into practice is definitely different than just rehearsing.”
Laxton seems up for the challenge, though. A recent graduate from Belmont University, he’s taken on numerous roles, including the lead of the raunchy puppet comedy Avenue Q. As this is both Laxton’s and the show’s first national tour, the actor said he has made it a point to take in the experience and watch how the show evolves over the course of the tour.
“I’m just living the dream right now. Everyone in the cast gets along really well. It feels like I’m on vacation with 30 of my closest friends,” Laxton said. “I’ve never been to L.A., so I’m really excited to see the sites. We have people from all over, so every city we go to we have at least one person who can recommend where to go and what to do.”
One of the curious parts of taking this production on the road is observing how various aspects of the show affect audiences differently depending on where they’re from. Laxton said that Brenda and her Southern belle family in particular, are received with varying levels of enthusiasm and understanding.
“They’re such specific characters. In some areas, people think they’re seeing their neighbors; in some areas, they aren’t as familiar,” Laxton said. “They’re Louisiana parents, so Georgia audiences are more familiar than Denver.”
As an added bonus, the 1960s timeline of the show plays on America’s current obsession with the Mad Men era. Laxton said the time period could definitely be aiding the success of the show, but regardless of what is trending now, he believes it’s story that’s here to stay.
“I think it’s a story that needs to be told over and over again. It’s fun —being in the ’60s, it is very glamorous,” he said. “The writers were inspired by the one scene in the movie where [Frank] comes walking out with all the stewardesses. They just said, ‘We have to write a musical about this.’”
Interestingly, Laxton said the entire cast had the opportunity to meet the real-life Frank Abagnale Jr. to get a better perspective on his life.
Though many might watch the show and get caught up in the drama of the scandals, Laxton said Abagnale looks at his life through a different set of eyes.
“He doesn’t want to be remembered for pulling off all these cons and being cool. He wants to be remembered for turning his life around, for making something of himself and working with the FBI, to make back every dollar that he’s stolen,” Laxton said. “He wants the fact that he redeemed himself and paid his debt to society to be the lesson.”
Even the most ridiculous parts of Abagnale’s life story — forging payroll checks, crisscrossing the country for free, convincing his fiancee’s parents that he’s both a doctor and a lawyer — are moments that, though fascinating to study, were never really planned.
“[Abagnale] never intended to do all the things that he did. He forged checks because he figured out that as long as he kept writing checks people would cash them. It’s really about a lonely kid figuring out how to move on,” Laxton said.
Perhaps though, Abagnale’s complex personality is what makes him resonate with audiences the most. Abagnale is not your typical bad guy, after all; rather, he’s a figure who gets caught in his own web of lies.
Thankfully, the musical offers a way for anyone to experience the ride without all of the consequences.

Monday afternoon, just hours before New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s proposed ban on large sugary drinks was to take effect, a state judge blocked the measure because of the law’s “arbitrary and capricious” nature.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
The court held that the city’s Board of Health encroached on the authority of the City Council in its approval of the law, a ruling that Bloomberg and the city almost immediately vowed to appeal.
Despite Bloomberg’s vociferous opposition to the decision, the court’s ruling was a sound one not only in its legal reasoning but also in its prevention of the growth of the nanny state and erosion of personal freedom.
The city ordinance, which was set to go into effect midnight on Monday, would have banned the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces throughout the city, albeit with a few exceptions made because of the regulation of some establishments by the state as opposed to the city.
Bloomberg’s high-profile ban was frightening in its implications for government’s growing power to regulate individuals’ freedom of choice. It is, and always should be, a person’s own decision whether they want to eat or drink something, regardless of the potential ill effects on their health.
The proposed ban was an example of New York City’s government grossly overstepping its bounds, but it was also something that would have done very little to curb what the mayor cited as the city’s “obesity epidemic.”
Though drinking too much soda has been proven to cause negative health effects, it is just one of many contributors to obesity. Obesity is a result not of one too many extra-large Dr Peppers, but also of generally poor eating habits and an overall lack of exercise.
With this in mind, it is clear that it is up to the individual to decide whether they will allow themselves to become or remain overweight, from drinking too much soda or otherwise.
Bloomberg’s proposed ban seems to ignore this. In fact, instead of compelling individuals to take health into their own hands, the measure shifts the blame for obesity to the establishments that sell sugary drinks, casting the government as the omnipotent guardian of people’s health.
This trend toward government involvement in all aspects of life is dangerous and counterintuitive to personal responsibility. In an age where people blame their ills on anything and anyone other than themselves, Bloomberg’s proposal only contributes to the trend by treating citizens like children incapable of making their own decisions.
Not only is such a ban an unjust and absurd intrusion of government power on individual freedom of choice, it is just another example of misdirected resources and government ineffectiveness. In a city plagued by such serious problems as poverty and inadequate public schools, Bloomberg’s focus on banning the sale of large sugary drinks is a complete waste of effort and money.
Instead of focusing on whether a person buys an 18-ounce Coke at the movies, maybe the city should concentrate on using its resources to reduce crime and provide better educations for kids. Unfortunately, Bloomberg’s vow to appeal the decision means that even more of the city’s money will go toward legal fees instead of back to New Yorkers.
A man interviewed by CNN on the streets of New York could not have summed it up any better: “I don’t care how much soda people drink — there are bigger issues in this city than people drinking sugar … I mean, look around us. Isn’t there more that our mayor can concentrate on than sugar?”
That the average citizen can recognize the flaws of such efforts by Bloomberg provides hope that the court will uphold its reversal of the ban. At the end of the day, the ban would bring nothing other than a dangerous expansion of government power while de-emphasizing the need for people to make smart decisions for themselves.

Bloomberg sits on the toilet thinking up ways to irritate and control people for his own enjoyment, while the whole time drawing public attention to himself that he craves so much !!!!!!  OY VEY!
Our local Gulp-Grabber court decision is below, compliments of the NY Times. While most media focus on the “arbitrary and capricious” standard, I believe there is a far larger one that the judge identifies and writes about.
 “The rule would not only violate the separation of powers doctrine, it would eviscerate it.”

On Friday, an Arizona state court upheld most provisions of House Bill 2281, a measure that suspended race-related courses, such as  Mexican-American studies, in Tucson public schools. The bill aims to remove courses intended for particular ethnic groups with the promotion of ethnic solidarity.
The author of the bill, Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne, called the ruling on HB 2281 a “victory for ensuring that public education is not held captive to radical, political elements and that students treat each other as individuals — not on the basis of the race they were born into.”
But rather evidently, the legislature passed constitutionally dubious HB 2281 in order to inhibit the awareness and advancement of Mexican-American identity. Even the judge who upheld the law noted this: “This single-minded focus on terminating the [Mexican-American studies] program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” U.S. Circuit Court Judge Wallace Tashima wrote.
With Asian-American studies and African-American studies standard choices for pupils across the United States, it is absurd for Arizona to ban Mexican-American studies. First, the classes are not forced upon students. Second, giving students the option of learning about an entirely different heritage actually enriches them.
Moreover, if students are confined to cookie-cutter content pertaining to only Caucasian settlers and innovators in their history courses, society cannot develop a culturally aware generation. Especially in a globalizing world, it is important for our students to learn about the plights and successes of other ethic groups.
And such ethnic studies appear to have positive effects for students: A University of Arizona report found that students in Tucson’s Mexican-American studies program had better test scores and graduation rates than those who did not participate, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Furthermore, HB 2281 reflects the racial tensions and prejudice within Arizona. In the past, many have argued that Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other officials have promoted a slew of measures aimed at suppressing Latinos in Arizona. From the controversial passage of the anti-illegal immigrant Senate Bill 1070 (which many claimed promoted racial profiling by law enforcement) to a more recent executive order prohibiting undocumented immigrants with temporary legal status in the United States from receiving state or local benefits, the work of Arizona’s leaders with regard to Latino citizens is questionable.
Luckily, the law is being challenged by Mexican-American studies student Nicholas Dominguez and his mother Margarita; the case is bound to reach the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to The Huffington Post.
Hopefully, the judicial system will appropriately strike down HB 2281 in the future and allow diverse cultural studies to continue in Arizona and across the country. The Arizona heat might sear the earth, but we cannot allow any individual or court to burn away the great strides civil rights leaders have made in this country.

I am fine with offering courses that study ethnicities – however I do think if we are going to do this then we have to be comprehensive about it. Why do universities never offer a White America Studies? How about a course that studies all the great contributions made by Caucasians throughout history? If we really are saying it is possible to study a group of people with their ethnicity as the common bond – then let’s start having courses that study and celebrate white people. Is it we never do this because it would become obvious to a child that such “studies” are very superficial when we draw these ethnic boundaries across society based on ethnicity?
