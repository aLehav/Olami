The Women of Troy entered the season ranked No. 1 in the nation and expected to hold that spot until season’s end. What they did not expect, however, was an early-season loss to formerly No. 9-ranked San Diego that sent them toppling down to No. 5.

But that’s what they got, and after three grueling road tournaments, the USC women’s volleyball team will make its long-awaited return to the Galen Center on Wednesday to host  UC Irvine.
The Women of Troy will square off against the Anteaters Wednesday and Cal State Fullerton Friday before beginning conference play next Wednesday against UCLA.
Despite suffering its first loss of the season, USC rebounded with a strong showing in the Saturday doubleheader, posting a 3-1 victory over UC Santa Barbara before knocking off Eastern Washington in a three-set sweep to improve to 8-1.
“We’re taking a slow and very focused approach in trying to get our team better,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “I expect Irvine to be good. They played well against us last spring. I expect them to come ready to play.”
Successful offseason recruiting and back-to-back sweeps of its opening two tournaments earned the Women of Troy their No. 1 ranking, and the team has received important contributions from seniors and freshmen alike. It is this hype that has motivated opponents to deliver stiff competition.
“Every team so far has tried to pick on something, so I’m sure [Irvine] will find something to pick on,” Haley said. “Those are the challenges that help us get better if we accept them. I feel like they’ll have a game plan and come after us and try to win this match.”
A combined 24 kills from freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard proved not to be enough on Friday against the Toreros, as the defense failed to contain a powerful USD attack. The team rebounded quickly, however, with unyielding performances against UC Santa Barbara and Eastern Washington that saw the Women of Troy drop just one of seven sets.
Senior libero Natalie Hagglund was named to an all-tournament team after recording 61 digs in the three matches, including 28 in the victory over Santa Barbara. She was joined by freshman Elise Ruddins, who notched a stellar 24 kills against UCSB and 14 against Eastern Washington to lead the team in both games.
Class standing has proven to be immaterial to USC’s success, as virtually all of Haley’s lineup combinations have produced excellent results against a wide array of opponents.
“We tried to employ a system at the beginning of the season where the upperclassmen were supposed to be leaders and the lowerclassmen would be followers,” Hagglund said. “But it’s actually switched a little bit. The younger players are developing their own leadership roles and bringing their own positive aspects of their game to the team.”
Haley, always one to emphasize improvement, noted that opponents are just as focused on USC’s strengths as he is, which will add to the difficulty of the team’s matches going forward.
“It will be a challenge for us, and it will be fun for us to play at home,” Haley said.
“I hope we serve very well, and I’m hoping to have our passing be improved. I’m looking forward to seeing how our blocking holds up because we’ve been working very hard with our blocking.”
It remains to be seen how well the team’s current dynamic will fare against strong conference opponents, but Haley is optimistic about his team’s prospects.
“This week is our last week before the conference,” Haley said. “We have two matches, and we need to be improving through each of them. I’ve got players challenging for playing time, so that will also be an interesting thing to watch.”

The bottom line is the national playoffs that shows what kind of year the team had. Probably a half-dozen teams
from the Pac – 12 will make the tournament so rankings mean little during the season. The Trojans have only one
good win this pre-conference vs. Purdue back there. Losing to San Diego in only four sets is very disheartening.
Think Haley is making a mistake a la Kiffin in using two setters in every match where you need repetition to gain
confidence in placement of the ball for the hitters.
that should say who almost**** lost to San Diego. Texas did beat San Diego in 5 sets. But nonetheless, San Diego is a very good squad. 
I don’t understand the cockiness of USC. I hate the tone in athletic articles and even this one. “USC was stunned by San Diego”
No, USC was beaten by a very good San Diego team. They were expected by many to win that game.
USC did NOT start the season ranked #1.. That was Texas, who also lost to San Diego.
Which means, USC’s loss to San Diego shouldn’t become that much of a surprise (currently San Diego is ranked #2 in the nation)
As for your picture, Hayley Crone doesn’t even play in the front row this year. Yet you say Crone’s blocking is ‘key’ for the Women of Troy this year.
It wasn’t expected for USC to go undefeated and be #1 the whole year. Have you followed volleyball recently? It’s nearly impossible to go through Pac-12 play undefeated, let alone the entire season.
Check your facts.

In the midst of all the excitement surrounding the hiring of USC men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield, I remained a bit wary. As the old saying goes, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. This time I wanted to remain impervious to the standard optimism associated with a new hire, and yet another promise of establishing a formidable USC basketball program.
The first time I was fooled was a result of the magical Elite Eight run that was supposed to be just a taste of the Henry Bibby era, only to regress spectacularly from that point. Then it was Bibby’s star-studded recruiting class headlined by Nick Young and Gabe Pruitt, which supposedly signaled a new direction for a program mired in mediocrity.
Then Tim Floyd was anointed as the savior, and the Trojan faithful expected him to work magic similar to his success with Marcus Fizer and Iowa State. The Galen Center was going to usher in a new era and O.J. Mayo’s commitment was an indication that USC could now attract a high caliber of talent. When that failed, Kevin O’Neill was going to restore integrity and discipline to the program, using a low-tempo, defense-oriented approach to replicate Tony Bennett’s success at Washington State.
Whether it’s been ineffective coaching, careless errors, academic apathy or allegations of impropriety, there has always been an impediment to USC ascending to the top of the college basketball world. Each time my confidence in USC basketball and dreams of Pac-12 championships galore were crushed by these unfortunate realities.
So this time, when Enfield was hired during Dunk City mania and the pinnacle of Florida Gulf Coast University’s hype, I resolved to stay realistic, and not let my inner fan get in the way of rational thinking. I pointed to the lack of effective half court sets run by Enfield in his team’s magical tournament run and the very real possibility that FGCU’s success was a flash in the pan, as they had lost twice to a marginal Lipscomb team in the regular season.
I promised I would not fall prey to the Enfield’s exciting vision and interesting backstory and I would temper expectations until it was evident that he could both talk the talk and walk the walk. I remained guarded when his impressive resume was recited ad nauseum after his hire. I ignored the temptation for excitement after his first press conference. I stayed grounded in past experiences as he talked about his grandiose, but completely realistic, vision for the future.
We’re only a short while into Enfield’s tenure, and I find my level of enthusiasm and excitement rising to unprecedented heights. With every statement issued and each tweet posted, my outlook on the team improves. I haven’t felt this type of excitement about USC basketball since Daniel Hackett bottled up Kevin Durant in the tournament upset of Texas.
This sudden buoyancy is more than just a fan’s unwavering optimism and confidence in his team; it is a feeling that this time is going to be different — that Andy Enfield is going to finally be the guy to put the Trojans back on track.
Whether it is on the recruiting trail or on the red carpet at the ESPYs, Enfield has the “it factor.”
On the recruiting front, USC is actively pursuing elite talent, such as Mater Dei prospect Stanley Johnson, for the first time since Floyd resigned. On Monday, Johnson released his list of top five schools, with USC making the cut alongside powerhouse Kentucky. Enfield’s undeniable magnetism and charisma is already yielding results, as five-star point guard Jordan McLaughlin spurned Kansas and UCLA to commit to USC. This will give USC a long-term solution at point guard for the first time since Brandon Glanville led the Trojans over a decade ago.
It’s more than just recruiting. Granted, O’Neill’s penchant for the quick fix turned USC into “Transfer U” and left the cupboard fairly empty, but Enfield’s up-tempo style is conducive to doing less with more. Though the majority of the excitement revolves around the future of Trojan basketball, it will be interesting to see if Enfield can replicate his success at FGCU in his first season at USC, using a fast-paced system to compensate for a competitive disadvantage in talent.
Junior guard Byron Wesley will serve as a model for future wings, utilizing his athleticism and open-court ability to finally fulfill his immense potential as a college guard. Senior guard J.T. Terrell will demonstrate how a shooter can flourish when freed of restraint and given a long leash. The 2013-14 season might not yield a championship, but it can cement the idea that Enfield is the coach of the future. Some of this exuberance can be chalked up to a die-hard fan’s resolute hope that his team will finally succeed, but there is also more than just that this time.
So far, it looks as if there is legitimate cause for excitement, that Enfield can deliver on his promise to the Trojan faithful, and can eventually have the team running and gunning toward conference and national championships.

All of last week, following their shocking loss to the Washington State Cougars, every aspect of the football program seemed to have a dark cloud hovering above it. Miscommunication on the team seemed to run rampant, and USC head coach Lane Kiffin had to coach amidst calls for his dismissal.
Scoreboard · USC junior wide receiver Marqise Lee scored a touchdown against Boston College, his first since Nov. 17 in a 38-28 loss against UCLA. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
But one week, and one lopsided win, has appeared to make a world of difference. USC came out on Saturday and trounced Boston College 35-7, and all seems well again in Troy. The team will have to hope for a similar effort against the visiting Utah State Aggies, a team many believe to be one of the most underrated in the nation.
LONG OVERDUE
“It was a minute,” junior receiver Marqise Lee said when asked how much time had passed since he last found the end zone.
His 80-yard touchdown in the second quarter against Boston College was a symbol of good things to come for the Trojan offense, which finally seemed to find its groove following two frustrating weeks in which the unit did not seem to be able to muster any sort of consistent attack.
“It felt good to score and actually get in the end zone and put some points on the board for the offense,” Lee said. “We’ve just got to stay focused on our game.”
ALL SETTLED
A big part of being able to score touchdowns and put some points on the scoreboard seemed to be the newfound confidence of redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler. Following a  back-and-forth two-week battle for the starting position with redshirt sophomore Max Wittek in which the two quarterbacks split game time and practice reps with the first team unit, Kessler was given full reins and control of the offense leading into Boston College, and it seemed to pay off.
“I definitely feel more comfortable and feel a lot more settled,” Kessler said. “I feel more established with the [first team] and we’re getting better and better as we go through the season.”
Kessler was stellar against the Eagles but will need to play even better against an extremely confusing and versatile Aggies defense.
“Utah State is one of those teams you have to watch a lot of film and know where every guy is,” Kessler added. “They just move around a lot, but I’m excited for the challenge.”
The Aggies have one of the most perplexing defenses in college football, prone to overpowering offensive lines on one play and then lining up just one defensive lineman on the next. Regardless of which tactic they use more often, the success or failure of the Trojans will depend mainly on the offensive line.
“I trust in my offensive line 100 percent,” Kessler said. “They’re going to handle whatever [Utah State] brings.”
ONCE IS ENOUGH
When Kiffin was asked after practice if university president C. L. Max Nikias will call the Trojans’ first offensive play for the second consecutive week, Kiffin did not hesitate in his response.
“Not again,” Kiffin said. “He’s 0-for-1.”
Regardless of whether or not he uses Nikias on Saturday, Kiffin had plenty of success calling plays against Boston College, as the Trojans gained more than 500 yards of offense with a near 50-50 split of rushing and passing yards.
A big component of that successful offensive attack has been the potent run game, highlighted by redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden, who on Saturday became the first USC running back since the legendary Marcus Allen with three consecutive 100-yard rushing games to open the season.
Madden’s breakout this season has taken many by surprise, but not Kiffin or the rest of the Trojan coaching staff.
“When we had seen him in practice, it was clear he was an every-down back,” Kiffin said. “It’s hard to start better than he has.”
Another back with great promise but who has yet to see action for the Trojans this season is senior Silas Redd. The Penn State transfer missed his third straight game last week, leading some to wonder if a redshirt might be coming his way, making him ineligible for the rest of this season.
“I don’t know that [a redshirt is being considered],” Kiffin said. “We’re hopeful he plays this week.”
Though Redd’s presence has been missed, the emergence of freshman tailback Justin Davis has made up for Redd’s absence. Davis is second on the team with 172 rushing yards on 26 carries, and leads the Trojans with two rushing touchdowns.

Two hundred blue and gold balloons rose to the heavens during a moment of silence at the UCLA-Nebraska football game to honor UCLA football player Nick Pasquale, who passed away on Sept. 8.

This sparked an emotional        41-21 victory for the Bruins over Nebraska, scoring 38 straight points after tailing 21-3 in the second quarter.
“Our goal today was to honor Nick,” UCLA coach Jim Mora said after the game. “Our goal today was to come out here and have our players reflect on everything he meant to us and everything that was great about him so that his family sitting at home … We did it for your son. We did it for your son.”
Nebraska also showed their respect by bearing Pasquale’s No. 36 on their helmets, while the Bruins had patches of his number on their jerseys.
There is a motto that comes from Pasquale’s hometown, San Clemente, Calif., that has brought his family, friends and the entire community together: One team. One town.
Even though USC and UCLA are rivals, they are still part of one football community. The Trojans showed their respect for the Bruins by honoring Pasquale before Saturday’s game against Boston College with a moment of silence.
Boston College quarterback Chase Rettig, who was Pasquale’s teammate at San Clemente, also wore an “NP” sticker in his honor.
USC sand volleyball player Alexa Strange, who was friends with Pasquale in high school, holds cherished memories about the guy they called “Pacman.”
“Nick had a contagious smile,” Strange said. “Ask anyone who knew him, and that’s probably what they would say first. It was the type of smile that made you smile regardless of how you felt or what you were doing. He was the type of guy that was always pretty sure of himself and knew who he was. He had everything going for him, and was one of the kindest and greatest people I’ve ever known, inside and out. So many people loved and cared about Nick.”
The rest of the Pac-12 football community also came together this past weekend to commemorate the great legacy that Pasquale put together as a stand-out all-county high school player and walk-on at UCLA.
Oregon’s entire team signed and sent a giant card to Pasquale’s family to show their respect, and the California coaches also sent condolences the family.
Other college football players, many of whom were Pasquale’s teammates in high school, also honored him in various ways, such as wearing his number on some part of their uniforms, eye black, or a simple point to the sky.
Utah quarterback Travis Wilson, who was one of Pasquale’s best friends in high school, played Saturday’s game against Oregon State in his honor and turned in perhaps the best performance of his career with five touchdowns, two passing and three rushing. Following each touchdown, Wilson pointed skyward in remembrance of his close friend.
“He really wasn’t the biggest kid and wasn’t the strongest kid on the field, but he had the biggest heart I’ve ever known in anybody,” Wilson told the Utah Desert News. “He definitely taught me some great lessons, and I’ll definitely never forget about him. It was a big loss for me and I’m definitely going to miss him a lot.”
More than 1,000 people, including Wilson, UCLA players and coaches, and USC walk-on wide receiver Christian Tober, a high school teammate, memorialized Pasquale in a service on Sunday in San Clemente.
“As a young kid on varsity [at San Clemente High School], he was one of the only older guys that accepted me and was nice to me,” Arizona kicker Bret Miller, a former high school teammate, said of his friend. “He was such a                     kind-hearted guy, always putting smiles on people’s faces. He will forever live in my heart as an amazing friend and teammate.”

R.I.P. 
…But I didn’t know the Daily Trojan was turning into the Daily Bruin? I’m not acting insensitive at all. Last year, in Apr. 2012, when those 2 Chinese engineering, grad students were slain, I read a lot of insensitive comments by UCLA people, I presume. In the LA Times, they wrote comments like, “too bad ‘The Festival Books’ went to SC…why would they want to host an event like that in the ghetto?…I guess USC is good at buying off football players, let alone The Festival of books, cheat on!…well, at least here in Westwood, we don’t have murders happening up the street.” 
I do not gloat at things like this. However, after reading comments like that, I cannot and will not show any empathy towards THEM.

USG held its first weekly meeting of the semester Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The public meeting discusses items on its agenda including the 2013-2014 concert schedule, nomination of USG Justices and funding for student organizations on campus.
Assistant Director of the Concerts Committee, Chardae Davis, reported this fall’s Welcome Back Concert yielded the highest attendance on record. Her committee hopes to elevate the profile of on-campus concerts this year.
“We’re currently securing an artist for Conquest, and planning ahead for Springfest,” Davis said. “We want to make sure we have the best artists possible.”
President Christian Kurth announced the appointment of four new USG justices, whose nominations will be confirmed by a Senate-wide vote next Tuesday.
USG justices serve as  arbitrators for cases of abuse or misbehavior within the organization. Their appointment lasts until their graduation.
Junior Anaeis Ebrehimi Masihi, one of the four nominees, served as a delegate for the Alumni Association last year. She said she feels excited about the possibility of increasing her involvement in USG.
“I wanted to have a more  hands- on role in student government, so I decided to apply,” Ebrehimi said. “[USG President] Christian Kurth called and left me a very enthusiastic voicemail, so I called back right away and accepted.”
The meeting also featured a presentation from Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom detailing USG’s fall budget.
“The financial state of the organization is positive. We’re enthusiastic about increased funding in the funding boards, which is up about 10 percent this year,” VanWoerkom said. “We have more money to give to student orgs than ever before, and we’re really excited about it.”
USG funding boards give financial aid to USC student organizations — up to $4,000 for the fall semester. USG encourages interested organizations to apply for funding.
USG Greek Senator Logan Heley directly addressed all attendees who were not USG members regarding Program Board funding.
“I’d encourage all of you to talk to your friends about USG [Program Board] funding. We’ve still got some money in the pot, so let’s put it toward good causes,” Heley said.

Paul R. Ignatius, the former Secretary of the Navy, gave a lecture on Tuesday entitled “Personal Leadership in Government & Business” to a group of students about the significance of personal leadership.
Igniting fire · USC alumnus and naval veteran Paul Ignatius discusses the notion of leadership to students Tuesday at Waite Phillips Hall. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Ignatius’s lecture, hosted by the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Department of Political Science, focused on using examples from past and present world events, as well as from his own experiences in order to instruct attendees on how to be effective, respectable leaders.
“The concept of leadership is more than a matter of giving orders and expecting an immediate response,” Ignatius said.
Throughout the lecture, Ignatius stressed the importance of patience, communication and interpersonal relationships in successful leadership.
After graduating from USC, Ignatius served as a World War II naval officer and earned an MBA from Harvard University. He was in active service for both the Kennedy and Johnson presidential administrations and worked for eight years as an Assistant Secretary of the Army before becoming Secretary of the Navy.
After his work in the government, he served as president of the Washington Post for two years and president of the Air Transportation Association for 15 years. He is also the author of On Board: My Life in the Navy, Government, and Business.
Ignatius urged students to try to understand the individuals that they are working with in order to lead more successfully. He said that by knowing the people in the situation, one is able to delegate certain responsibilities to certain individuals confidently and ensure that the individual will be able to get the job done.
“Don’t do everything yourself, delegate it to others,” Ignatius said. “Delegation is not abdication, rather, [delegation] implies reciprocity.”
Some students found Ignatius’s advice on delegation particularly eye-opening.
“I feel like there’s a notion these days that in order to be successful, you have to take on a leadership role and do everything yourself,” said Ivy Lam, a  freshman  majoring in business administration. “So it was really cool to hear someone as experienced and intelligent as [Ignatius] talk about the importance of making connections and delegating responsibilities as a way to be successful.”
Many attendees were in the class “Leadership in World Politics,” taught by Professor Richard Dekmejian. Anyone, however, was welcome to attend.
“I thought that his speech was particularly interesting because of all that he’s accomplished,” said Ashley Modell, an undecided freshman who sat in on the lecture. “His long list of accomplishments almost made what he was saying more believable and more valuable to me. I just sat in on his lecture, not a part of the class, and I felt that the information was still just as valuable to me.”
Ignatius also told attendees to view things from a less self-centered perspective.
“Try to see things as others see them, and not as you see them,” Ignatius said. “It is terribly important to view circumstances as someone else would view them, rather than as you do.”
To illustrate his point , Ignatius provided the example of the Vietnam War, pinpointing the reason for the failure on the United States’ tendency to only think of the Vietnamese army as a mirror of their own. He noted that the major escalation of the war came from the United States’ inability to fully comprehend the other side.
“It was really cool how [Ignatius] gave exact examples from American politics and related them back to the basic elements of how to be a good leader on a level that was easy for us students to relate to,” said Larke Nimocks, an undecided freshman.
Miranda Hearst, a freshman majoring in communication, also enjoyed Ignatius’s use of real world events to explain his points.
“It wasn’t like he was just feeding us tips and information without any substance to them,” Hearst said. “He was giving us real-world examples of how this information is actually useful and has been valuable in the past.”
Ignatius ended his lecture with a simple adage.
“Do the right thing,” he urged. “Even though it may be a hard choice.”

Morley Winograd, a senior fellow at the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy, and Geoffrey Cowan, former dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, addressed students in a lecture entitled “Privacy, Entertainment and the Millennial Generation” on Tuesday.
Generation gap · Author and former White House official Morey Winograd discusses how millennials will change and adapt to social media. – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
 
Winograd, who recently published an e-book entitled Millennial Majority, is an expert on the millennial generation.
Around 20 students, many of whom were part of Cowan’s ASCJ 100 elective, “The Changing World of Communication and Journalism,” attended the event.
The discussion started with the role the millennial generation has played and will play in politics. Winograd cited mobility as the key to this generation’s lifestyle. Those under 30  struggle with the choice between individual freedom and collective responsibility, Winograd said.
The notion of collective action has been ingrained into society from everything regarding the way people assess traffic with Waze to the choices people make for a meal with Yelp. Organizing society has changed from electing experts to relying on the wisdom of a group. This idea of communion is something Winograd expressed as a defining point of the millennial generation. Even the definitions of bad and good are more trusted if they come from a group than if they come from an individual.
Winograd honed in on how millennials are incapable of making decisions for themselves. Most students in the room agreed they would rather read a review on movie-rating website Rotten Tomatoes than trust a movie review in a newspaper. Some said that they would choose Rotten Tomatoes because it incorporates a group of opinions versus newspaper articles.
The conversation soon shifted from the material students choose to read about movies to the medium on  which they read articles. Students said they relied on apps such as Fandango and Flixster to help them choose a movie.
“All of those apps assume that there is wisdom in the group, and that it is smarter than being experts,” Winograd said of the trend toward digital media.
Students at the talk tended to agree with Winograd’s analysis of their generation.
“The USC community is greatly affected by this concept, because I can’t really name many people that aren’t involved in social networking. People are really influenced by social sharing, often distracting them from their classwork,” Raquel Zsupnik, a junior majoring in communication who works for the CCLP, said. “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s just because we’re so used to so much technology surrounding us that we don’t know anything different.”
Students also acknowledged the harms associated with social media and the amount of personal information released to the public. In spite of this, nearly all claimed even this couldn’t prevent them from updating their Facebook or sending a tweet.
“You’re the generation most willing to trade off privacy for benefits,” Winograd said.
For the USC community, the benefits seem to outweigh the cost of privacy.
“Personally for me, as a business administration major, it’s just going to have an impact on how I see entrepreneurial opportunities. This shows that social media has changed the world of journalism, which is definitely something to take into account when picking out your major,” freshman Cubby Sporrong said.
Others saw social media affecting students past college and in future careers.
“Students could have both positive and negative views on social media, but either way it’ll just shape the way students do things with careers in the future,” Avae Masaniai, a sophomore majoring in communication, said.
As USC students and the rest of the millennial generation embrace the growing role of collective decision-making     and social media in their lives, Winograd stressed the “ability to tell stories,” as he said it will be valuable for the future of media.
“America will never be the same,” Winograd said.

Students living on W. 28th St, better known as The Row, will find extra company on certain days this semester in the form of Los Angeles Police Department officers.
According to USC Interfraternity Council Vice President of Judicial Affairs Carlos Portela, the IFC, working in conjunction with LAPD and the Dept. of Public Safety, have been in talks since the spring 2013 semester about ways to reduce crime on The Row.
The changes in policy enforcement, which Portela said were brought about due to “LAPD wanting to step up their efforts in this area,” will concern the health and safety of students on The Row.
Portela estimated that roughly 10 officers were on The Row on Thursday, Sept. 12, and that the number would remain relatively consistent for future nights when  fraternities host parties on The Row.
“Regulations are still the same except that IFC is working with DPS and LAPD to communicate better,” he said. “On a night where there are events, IFC and DPS officers are constantly communicating.”
The inclusion of LAPD officers on The Row marks a change from previous years, when LAPD largely left regulation of the area to DPS officers.
“LAPD will not give the students the benefit of the doubt,” Portela said, noting that DPS officers are “hoping more to educate students” than to use strictly punitive measures.
LAPD did not respond to requests for comment.
DPS officers will continue to have a presence on The Row in addition to the LAPD police force, which will be present during  particularly high-risk nights. The two departments will meet at least once a week to discuss security.
“Some students do not respect DPS,” Panhellenic Council Vice President of Judicial Affairs Teddy Leatherman said. “I think sometimes there needs to be a little extra reinforcement, but I don’t think it’s necessary for them to be there at all times.”
The LAPD officers will have jurisdiction to issue citations to those caught violating the law, including those drinking in public or carrying open containers of alcohol.
“Without some type of  enforcement, you rarely get compliance,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. “We want to maintain order on The Row and keep it civil so that everyone can have fun on The Row without the binge drinking that we have seen in previous years.”
Carlisle said that students have been told in the past how to “socialize within the law” in the form of fliers handed out on the street.
All sorority houses within jurisdiction of Panhellenic Council are dry, so the new LAPD presence will primarily affect fraternity houses. According to Leatherman,  Panhellenic Council is throwing full support behind the IFC in its cooperation with authorities.
Increased police presence might also have an impact on Greek tailgating events. Portela said that though drinking on public property has never been technically allowed, its prohibition will be more strictly enforced.
“In the coming weeks, we will see much more enforcement on that end,” he said. “So, some houses will have to tailgate indoors.”
Despite LAPD presence, the decision to break up parties and general student security will continue to fall primarily within DPS’s jurisdiction.
“LAPD has not broken down any parties on The Row this year,” Portela said. “It’s DPS’s role before LAPD on that end.”
Both Portela and Leatherman confirmed that neither IFC nor Panhellenic Council requested LAPD presence.
“They came on their own,” Leatherman said. “They want to be on The Row, and they have the right to be there.”
In addition to the officers, two paramedics will be stationed on The Row, and water bottles will be handed out to “avoid incidents with people drinking too much,” Portela said.
The changes were not brought on by any particular incident, but rather by an increased focus on decreasing emergency medical calls to The Row, Portela said.
It remains uncertain whether additional procedural changes will occur over time. Leatherman said that some of the policies are not yet finalized.
“There will only be changes necessary if we don’t see a change in attitudes and education,” Portela said. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean things will get worse.”
It remains to be seen what effect these changes will have on social events on the street, but Leatherman said that Greek life is about more than partying.
“It’s going to remain a fun, social place and it will give back to the community,” she said. “I think The Row can remain the same.”
Students had strong opinions about LAPD’s new involvement.
“It’s unnecessary for the LAPD to be on The Row,” said Abiola Oseni, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I feel like they can do better things with the tax payers’ money. We already have DPS officers on The Row, and I don’t feel unsafe on The Row now, so I don’t feel like they need to have an increased presence there.”
Others said that stricter monitoring would only force secretive drinking, which could be even worse.
“It’s going to do more harm than good,” said a sophomore majoring in biology who wished to remain anonymous said. “People are just going to pre-game, and when you pre-game  super hard, you have no idea how the alcohol is going to affect you.”
Some students, however, defended the new presence of LAPD officers.
“There is kind of a problem in terms of the amount of drinking and the problems that come with how much goes on The Row,” a sophomore majoring in economics who wished to remain anonymous said. “This might help it get down to a level that’s more acceptable.”
One graduate student who did not want to be named said she had attended USC for her undergraduate studies and recalled that this reflects a larger trend in Row security.
She said that when she arrived at USC in 2009, it was “absolutely hectic” on The Row, with students partying in the streets. But as time passed, she said, DPS ramped up its role, causing many older students to avoid The Row. She said that she believes changes such as greater enforcement will cause a change in the school’s image — for better or worse.
“This changes the whole dynamic of USC,” she said. “Sometimes it feels like they’re more out to get us than help us.”

Maybe if these whining, spoiled, juvenile behaving students started to act more like responsible adults LAPD wouldn’t need to be there.  They should release all the calls made to LAPD in that area especially during football season from students being drunk, belligerent and gangsters beginning to infiltrate the area.  Yes, I agree LAPD could be elsewhere.   I wish someone would take video of the behavior of these immature USC students and post it all over the internet so parents can see how their money is being wasted at this expensive school on their brats
USC is making great strides in developing a social atmosphere in keeping with its academic rise. What is missing, though, is self-policing by Greek houses in relation to drinking. The houses themselves, as in other universities, need to be responsible for turning away those that pre-game and are obviously drunk, underage drinkers and be responsible to ensure there is no drinking to excess at their houses. Graduated layered consequences for infractions by the houses can be established.
Fraternities can be provided every measure of support to create fun events that do not involve excessive alcohol use or drinking by minors. 
If USC is serious about public drinking to excess, alums and parents need to be reminded to leave their full bars at home, rather than transport them to under their tents on game day. This can be requested as an effort to support USC’s well placed efforts to raise the bar for social behavior.
Great, bottles of water to mix with my scotch.   How about some ice?
I will pray for you and hope you repent of all your sins; especially, fornicating and drinking late at night when you should be studying.
Sorry for partying

Remember the good old days, when you could just collide with a stranger in the frozen food aisle and fall hopelessly in love? Neither do I. You know why? Because real life is not scripted in Hollywood and these serendipitous meetings don’t happen to the majority of the population.
That’s also why the modern trend of dating through mobile phone applications has become a common occurrence. Granted, certain mobile apps are regarded as ways to find no-strings-attached hookups. That is one road a digital dater can take — but it’s not the only road.
One such app that has gained a recent boost in popularity is Tinder. Developed by local entrepreneurs Sean Rad, Justin Mateen, Jonathan Badeen and Christopher Gulczunski, Tinder has seen a rapid increase in users since its Sept. 14, 2012 release. Mateen and Rad are USC alumni and as a result, the University of Southern California was one of the first colleges to which Tinder was introduced.
As the fastest-growing free dating app in the United States, dating through Tinder has recently come under fire. Two million matches are made every day, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Such rapid matchmaking can’t actually be considered legitimate dating, can it?
Tinder is a uniquely designed application. It appeals to the instant gratification that enthralls our generation by employing a swipe-to-the-left, swipe-to-the-right user interface. Judgment can be passed upon another in less than a second; some Tinder users seem to do this mindlessly, as someone would judge the hotness of a passersby on the way to class. Others take a minute or two for photo analysis and careful consideration of personality potential.
No matter your method of attack, all you have to do is pass your finger to the left to say “Nope” or flick it to the right to indicate you’ve “Liked” the other person — using Tinder really is that simple.
Or is it? There’s a subtle art to creating a profile that will catch the eyes — and right-swishing fingers — of others. Yes, that professionally done headshot makes you look real pretty, but c’mon, this is L.A., and headshots are a dime a dozen. Choose a photo in which you look presentable but also make sure it’s indicative of how you look on a day-to-day basis; there’s nothing worse than pulling a Catfish and pretending to be someone else through social media.
Tinder is also constructed to sync itself with your Facebook profile. Don’t worry, though: The app won’t post to your profile or announce to your entire newsfeed that you’ve begun using a dating service. Instead, Tinder uses the movies, books, films and other random stuff you’ve “Liked” on Facebook to match you up with other Tinder users of your preferred gender.
Mutual friends also factor into the equation, with the intention that these components will combine with physical attraction to ensure a better match. Users are only allowed to chat with each other when the Liking has been mutual. As a result, the harsh blow of rejection is somewhat softened. No match means no meaningless chat.
At this point, you might be asking yourself whether using an app such as Tinder is a good idea. After all, let’s consider the facts: You’re smart, funny, cute, all that good stuff. Why shouldn’t you be able to just meet someone in real life, through a normal situation, without the help of technology?
That’s just it, though. What is a normal circumstance? Who cares if you and your boyfriend or girlfriend or whoever met through an app or at Starbucks? It’s 2013. Stranger things have occurred.
I’ve used Tinder. I’ve also used Grindr. Yeah, I’ll admit it. As an uncertain, nervous sophomore entering the confusing and intimidating social sphere of gay collegiate life, Grindr was useful. It was a way to show myself that there were plenty of other guys around me who were just like me. Well, maybe not just like me, because I think we can all agree Grindr can get a little sketchy. For the readers who don’t know, Grindr is a location-based dating application that’s exclusively for gay men of all ages (and when I say all, I really do mean all).
In addition to Grindr and Tinder, there are countless other dating apps, some just for straight people, some just for lesbians, some just for gay guys and every other combination of people seeking romance that you could think of. So, back to the larger issue at hand: Does the usage of a mobile dating application diminish the validity of a relationship?
My answer is no, it does not diminish anything at all. L.A., as is the case with any other metropolis, is filled with people. Yet so much distance exists between these people that sometimes it does take an outside influence to bring them together. It shouldn’t matter whether that influence is a mutual friend or a mobile app or a dating website or pure dumb luck while out in public.
That’s why Tinder is actually really great. You’re taking fate into your own hands and making a direct effort to find someone based upon your own interests and social spheres.
How else would a West Coast university student meet an Ivy League graduate who just moved to the area? In what other way could a painter and a financial consultant realize they both like the Facebook pages for curly fries, Nietzsche and Lolcats?
If you’re still doubting the validity of a spark ignited by Tinder, consider this: Nana Meriwether, the 2012 Miss USA and an all-around hot mama, was on a July front page of the New York Post confirming that she has used Tinder. Enough said.

The Naked And Famous might someday live up to the two adjectives that constitute its band name, but for now, the alternative electro-pop group from New Zealand hasn’t yet made it.
Not quite famous and not at all naked (in the lyrical sense, due to an insane amount of production), the five band members recently made the jump from Auckland to Los Angeles, which — given the glitz and shimmer that their music exudes — feels much more appropriate.
A slew of genres could be used to classify the band’s sound: indie-pop, electro, synthpop and alternative rock, to name a few. The band mashes all of the genres together to create a sound that works just as often as it doesn’t. They borrow simplicity from the xx, drama from Radiohead, pop from MGMT and Foster The People and indie credibility from Passion Pit. It doesn’t sound too bad, but striking a proper balance between successful musical influences is something The Naked And Famous hasn’t yet accomplished.
The Naked And Famous emerged as indie-pop darlings in 2010 with their debut album, Passive Me, Aggressive You. Their two singles “Young Blood” and “Punching In a Dream” were summer synth hits that resonated with the mainstream hipster crowd. In the two songs, they mastered the formula for tracks that were a perfect hybrid of dancing jubilation and rebellious angst. Now, with In Rolling Waves, the band is challenged with pushing the envelope.
“Hearts Like Ours,” the new album’s clear single, sounds like 2010’s “Young Blood” after being roused from a nap. The enthusiastic cries of “Yeah, yeah, yeah” on the latter track could easily be sliced into the former without disrupting any of its existing features. On “Hearts,” however, backup “aahs” fill the fleeting voids between lines, easy fodder for swaying and swooning concert-goers. Perhaps their signature wordless singalong cries are a key component of their infectious electro-pop hipster anthems. “Half awake and almost dead / Keeping empty beds elsewhere,” lead singer Alisa Xayalith coos on the track, “We’re yet to bleed / All the time and energy.” Her words drip with a longing to communicate the familiar teenage feelings of being misunderstood.
The rest of the album’s lyrics hold as much potency as anything Lana del Rey’s ever concocted, which isn’t saying much. Just like indie queen Lana del Rey, The Naked and Famous are particularly apt at delivering vapid lyrics meant to evoke feelings of sadness, angst and rejection. In the end, however, both acts still make catchy tunes.
Xayalith, a feisty, self-described “little runt” (per Twitter), can sound sharp, and her voice is undoubtedly piercing. Her straining vocals on the hard-hitting indie pop jams “Young Blood” and “Punching In A Dream” carried the band’s debut effort, but on In Rolling Waves, Xayalith shines when she’s not trying so hard to sing a song she can simultaneously dance to.
In the title track, “Rolling Waves,” she tones it down a notch and eases into a breathy lull, a sound that’s enabled a recent rise in female vocalists (see: Lorde, Grimes, Haim, etc.). Xayalith isn’t quite cool enough to step into that elite pixie-vixen category; she’s too busy teeming with angst and Karen O-envy. The singer even ditched her pitch-black hair for slate gray four months ago and chopped it into a bob three weeks ago (is it a coincidence that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer dyed her short locks blonde at the beginning of this year?).
Regardless, Xayalith definitely demonstrates that she’s not all sass, speed and energy on Rolling Waves. Her voice floats against the synth line like a harp bouncing off an electric guitar, and the result is entrancing. When the soft tinkling of piano keys emerge toward the end, her voice echoes, undulating continuously like her repetition of “rolling waves” until the song fades into silence.
On “What We Want,” she shares her powerful pipes with backup harmonies that channel Broadway’s Rent and mews against an acoustic guitar and violin on the ultimate track, “A Small Reunion.” It’s a change of pace from her shrill riot-shriek, and one that trades her sugary pop sound for something that almost has depth.
The effort falters when Xayalith and guitarist Thom Powers dabble in the call-and-response style in “The Mess.” It’s a tired tactic that seeks to emulate arguing lovers but is cheapened by its sappy lyrics. “I’m swelling and eager,” Powers sings and Xayalith counters, nodding to album’s loose aquatic theme, “I’m the raging sea.” “I’ve had it up to here now,” he calls again drowsily. “I’m so tired of your needs,” she cries. The song comes across like a couple’s quarrel that doesn’t have much substance. It breaks away from balladry and into a screeching synth line with chants attempting oomph, but the duet never achieves its desired level of dimension.
In Rolling Waves is a solid effort, but doesn’t exhibit much range from the New Zealand outfit — but at least it’s comforting that the album strives to be great.

Whether he was menacing Patricia Arquette as a lust-murdering mob enforcer in True Romance, fending off a barrage of Scottish obscenities as In The Loop’s impulsive armchair general or lending his gruff, careworn voice to the tantrum-prone Carol in Where the Wild Things Are, James Gandolfini built his career around playing characters with volcanic tempers.
Can’t get Enough · Julia Louis-Dreyfuss (right) plays the role of Eva, a Los Angeles massage therapist whose love interest (Gandolfini, not pictured) turns out to be the dreaded ex-husband of a close friend. – Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Films
In Enough Said, writer-director Nicole Holofcener’s perceptive, heartfelt comedy about the hazards of middle-aged love, the late actor reveals his range by convincingly inhabiting the soul of a man far removed from the likes of Tony Soprano: a sweet, mild-mannered schlub who only gets miffed when he has to pick the onions out of his guacamole.
Enough Said marks Holofcener’s return to the big screen after a three-year dalliance with Parks and Recreation and Mike White and Laura Dern’s underappreciated HBO series Enlightened. It opens with a day in the life of Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a high-strung masseuse and single mother determined to sort out her life before her teenage daughter (Tracey Fairaway) departs for college. She’s also dealing with a difficult new client: the beautiful but pretentious Marianne (Holofcener’s on-screen muse Catherine Keener), a celebrity poet who offers prosaic life lessons (and free food from her garden) before launching into well-rehearsed tirades against her boorish ex-husband.
While attending a dinner party on the advice of her best friend Sarah (Toni Collette, finally getting to use her natural Australian accent), Eva meets the shy, self-effacing Albert (Gandolfini), another soon-to-be empty nester who works as an archivist at a nearby museum of television history. The two divorcées hit it off, and before long their flirtations blossom into a full-blown courtship. A second chance at lifelong love seems assured, at least until Eva realizes that Albert is actually Marianne’s first husband, a revelation that causes her to fixate on his every flaw and foible, from his weight problem to his strange aversion to end tables.
That plot twist might seem a tad contrived, but there’s much more to Enough Said than its deceptively simple narrative would suggest. Like Woody Allen, another longtime chronicler of first world problems, Holofcener is extremely adept at creating relatable, lived-in spaces for her characters to inhabit. By allowing Albert and Eva room to develop without the need for much in the way of requisite drama, they become like old friends with pressing business, the kind you wouldn’t dream of turning away.
Holofcener also has a gift for writing gender-specific dialogue that sounds both witty and naturalistic. That’s a welcome rarity, especially in the realm of romantic comedies, which too often read like sitcoms with muted laugh tracks. Holofcener’s last film, 2010’s Please Give, was an unexpectedly poignant look at the nature of middle-class guilt in the first years of the recession.
Dreyfus, who’s only appeared in a handful of movies since the end of Seinfeld in 1998, does an excellent job capturing the queasy, rudderless feeling of a mother struggling to let go of her only child. Some viewers might find her character’s nervous tics and mercurial attitude grating, but it’s important to remember that this is a woman who feels like her entire world is coming to an end.
One of the film’s greatest strengths comes from its willingness to let Dreyfus and Gandolfini’s odd-couple chemistry ferment into what feels like a realistic, warts-and-all relationship. The entire plot is really just an excuse to watch these two play off each other, and both actors embrace their roles with tender, awkward gusto. The scene where they lie in bed together and gently analyze each other’s imperfections carries more dramatic heft and insight than any on-screen pairing you’re likely to see this year.
Keener, a veteran of four previous Holofcener-helmed projects, gives the finest performance of the movie with the exception of Gandolfini, elevating what could have been a stereotypical hag into a humane, fully realized character, while Collette and Ben Falcone (the undercover air marshal in Bridesmaids) provide the majority of the laughs as Sarah and her romantically hapless husband.
In the end though, Enough Said belongs to Gandolfini, and not just because of the full-screen dedication that plays over the closing credits. He was up to something here, polishing his comedic chops for the second act of his post-Sopranos career, something we will never see save for this film and one more, Animal Rescue with Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace, scheduled for release sometime next year. There’s a gentleness in his eyes when he’s playing Albert, a warmth that was tempered in the past by harder times and heavier roles. It exists now as a reminder of an enormous talent that was taken far too soon.

In response to “Petraeus unfit to mentor USC students”
Self-proclaimed radical, Jayel Aheram, recently wrote an article for the Daily Trojan stating his belief that General Petraeus is unfit to mentor USC veterans.  His article is rife with hypotheticals, speculation and unsubstantiated “facts,” and the crux of his argument is an out-of-context quote from Marine veteran, Ian Daily, who is quoted as saying that Petraeus is “out-of-touch” and “disconnected” from those who served under him; it is implied that this makes him unfit to mentor veterans. Daily clarified his position by saying, “[H]is presence and influence at USC has been instrumental in bringing veterans’ issues to the forefront of the administration’s attention, and cannot be understated. The vast majority of veterans at USC have been supportive of his appointment both to the faculty and as an adviser to the Veterans Association.” While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I must now express mine as to why Aheram is unfit to cast judgment on General Petraeus.
Aheram does not represent the voices of USC’s veterans. In fact, he is the lone individual who has expressed that reservation to us. His attack is even more surprising because he is not a participant in the Veterans Association. For someone who has no interest in the USCVA, why does he have an interest in its faculty adviser? His biased position is in stark contrast to that of the majority of our members.  Marlene Julye, a Navy veteran, understands that “it is important to have an opinion, but it is equally important to produce a well researched and balanced editorial that allows readers to obtain the full picture … it is often easier to say what people should do, when they do not have to step into their shoes.” What Aheram fails to consider is that every service member experiences the military differently and, because of that, he should have refrained from presuming that the veteran community agrees with his opinion. It does not.
In March 2013, General Petraeus spoke at the USC ROTC/Veterans Reception. It was his first public speech since he resigned from the CIA. There, he not only apologized for the mistake that led to his resignation, but vowed “to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which [he] subscribed before slipping [his] moorings and, as best as possible, to make amends to those [he] has hurt and let down.” Since joining the USC faculty in July, General Petraeus has actively lived up to his promise to make amends, and advocating for veterans is just the beginning.
In a Wall Street Journal article, General Petraeus details the complexities of integrating veterans into the job force. “[S]imply providing a job may not be the optimal solution, because the issue for these men and women isn’t just jobs. It’s careers.” That statement echoes our viewpoint — that USC is the launching point for our future careers. Having an adviser who understands our unique needs is a valuable asset that reflects the high standard expected in every USC faculty member. Kraig Patriquin, an Army veteran, feels that “student-faculty relationships are an integral part of higher education. I am honored to have the man I took orders from during my three tours in Iraq as my new faculty adviser.”
In short, General Petraeus has already had a profound impact on the veteran community at USC. He has been an advocate of veteran issues from day one and an inspiration to all of our members. The USCVA is honored to have him as our faculty adviser and we look forward to the progress we will make together.

Bully for you, Junior Birdman! General Petraeus stands among our finest wartime leaders.  Great male leaders have a unique magnetism for adventurous women.  I’m not sure I don’t envy that magnetism.
Stand tall.
Fight On!

Making personal attacks on a Veteran for voicing his opinion; classy.
Aheram’s article certainly has it’s flaws but claiming he is trying to speak on behalf of all veterans is absurd. That is exactly what you are trying to do by speaking for the USCVA.  Aheram is perfectly fit to judge the hiring of Petraeus; and you should know this as a law student.
The USCVA needs a drastic “surge”. 
Sadly, the community college I transfered from (with a $100K endowment) has a better veteran program than USC.
In short, what “profound impact” has Petraeus had on the USCVA?
Are the number of yellow ribbon program recipients still less than 1/10 of the school’s veterans?
What does the USCVA do to promote mental health? 
I used to be a big fan of Petraeus and I hope he can restore his grace while making the USCVA relevant..

When students of human resources teacher Idalia Hernandez Ramos sat down for class one August day at their high school in northern Mexico, they assumed the lesson would be just like any other. Hernandez would probably give a lecture — or maybe a pop quiz. As the class unfolded, however, the students realized that Hernandez had a more important matter to settle.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Hernandez’s lesson for the day revolved around social media and how the misuse of social media can cause conflict and in some cases, the need for revenge. Hernandez had come across derogatory tweets about her posted on Twitter. The posts were written by one of her students sitting in class that day, and as that student and the rest of the world was about to find out, Hernandez had no intention of letting it slide.
Instead, Hernandez returned fire using none other than the same social media techniques that the student had used to insult her. As Hernandez began her confrontation, student bystanders pulled out their smartphones and captured the drama in an eight-minute video that has since gone viral and garnered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube.
The video begins with Hernandez presenting the lesson for the day, but quickly escalates when Hernandez asks the offending student — who is unnamed because she is a minor — to read a statement about social media. Hernandez then proceeds to interrogate her about the harmfulness of social media and demand why the student had posted insults about her on Twitter.
She also demands that the student apologize to her in front of the cameras, to which the clearly embarrassed student admits that she was wrong to post such insults. But Hernandez won’t stop there — no, not without calling the offending student and another student who shared the posts “cowards,” repeating the vulgar insults back to the students and saying: “Listen to me well: I will not allow anyone to call me that, especially a young brat like you and you.”
Though Hernandez’s attack was not necessarily unwarranted, it was certainly inappropriate and outrageously excessive. Not only was the student humiliated in front of her friends and peers, but now also in the eyes of hundreds of thousands of online viewers. The Internet allows for that humiliation to extend so far beyond the classroom, a punishment that the student, who had already admitted to and apologized for the tweets, does not deserve.
Not only was Hernandez unfair to the student — she was downright rude to the entire class. The teacher attempted to make an example out of one student who disrespected her, but in doing so, she disrespected the rest of the students and their academic ambitions. Hernandez made a mockery of the classroom and deviated from undoubtedly important lesson plans in order to execute her own revenge.
No matter how angry she might have been, Hernandez should not pit students against each other and involve herself in a social media war with said students. As an educator, she should have been above that.
Her primary focus should have centered around her students and ensuring that they are able to learn in an academic environment each day. The student deserved to be chastised for her unkind posts, yes — but not in a way that would so publicly humiliate her. Hernandez behaved in an unprofessional manner when she allowed students to record the confrontation on their cameras, which basically encouraged posting and sharing the video.
Social media sites have already affected many aspects of everyday life, but what goes on inside of the classroom should be an exception. Both students and teachers should focus on providing the best possible learning experience and on maintaining an academic atmosphere at all times. Allowing students or teachers to record the goings-on of the classroom and turn them into social media sensations is simply irresponsible and unproductive to students’ educations.
Since the incident happened in August, Hernandez has been put on administrative leave, and the student was suspended for two weeks. The case is currently being reviewed by Mexican courts, but it might take up to four months for Hernandez’s fate to be decided.

I am not sure this was excessive. The reason there is such unbridled meanness on the internet is because quite frankly – a lot of bratty cowards tweet and post from the safety and comfort behind their desk but forget if they truly have the courage of their convictions – they can look a person in the eye face  to face and also claim they were in the right. I am tired people tweeting stuff they would not have the courage to say in front of people. For all the cyberbullies – i would love for them to be forced to read what they themselves have actually written.
