The Undergraduate Student Government introduced a resolution tackling campus climate reform at its weekly meeting Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. On Monday, the same resolution was presented to the Graduate Student Government, adding to the conversation about campus diversity that has gathered momentum over the past few weeks.
The members and directors of various student assemblies — among them the Latina/o Student Assembly, APASA, Women’s Student Assembly, Diversity Affairs and the USG Senate —  authored the resolution. USG President Rini Sampath, also a key author, led the presentation of the resolution.
Sampath began by showing a photo of herself when she received her USC acceptance letter, using it to illustrate the difference between the experience she expected and the one she has had.

“This is a picture of me looking pretty disheveled at 17, clutching my USC acceptance letter because I was so, so stoked to get into this school,” Sampath said. “I was beyond happy. It was my dream school. And I’m sure many in this room know that feeling, of being able to get accepted into one of the best universities in the country.”
Moira Turner, director of diversity affairs, also showed a past photo of herself.
“This is my freshman year, with a couple of my friends, and I was super excited to be part of the USC campus, really starting to get my foot in the water with USG,” Turner said.
Sampath and Turner then discussed the idea of the Trojan Family, and how it is vitally embedded in USC culture.
“[The Trojan Family] has this underlying notion of inclusivity, having everyone be part of this very large family, a ‘happy family’ kind of thing,” Turner said.
Sampath elaborated on the University’s public commitment to diversity and how it relates to reality.
“The word ‘diversity’ pops out a lot in the marketing materials,” Sampath said. “We talk about having one of the most diverse student bodies, a huge international student community. But in reality, what does the word ‘diversity’ actually mean? Is it just a marketing ploy to get students into the room? What are we doing to support those diverse groups of students? Are they feeling left out? Excluded?”

The reality of the campus climate, Sampath argued, is much different from that depicted in the materials  presented by the University.
“This conversation isn’t anything new — we’ve been having it for years now,” she said.
Sampath showed video of an incident in May 2013, where more than 70 LAPD officers, some in riot gear, responded to a noise complaint and shut down a student party. The result was a sit-in at Tommy Trojan led by then-student Nate Howard and other supporters. They spoke out about how students on campus were feeling, holding signs with slogans such as “I want to be a part of the Trojan Family” and “Why does the color of my skin matter?”
Sampath also talked about the “I, Too, Am USC” campaign, in which students spoke out against micro-aggressions experienced on campus. Sampath showed another image of student harassment in which students appeared to be carrying a fake gun and mocking Arab culture.
Sampath and Turner went on to express frustration at the progress made with the Awujo house, a space for programming centered on the African diaspora. The resolution to institute the House, Sampath mentioned, was passed a year ago but and has gathered little administrative support since.
Before presenting the resolution, Sampath concluded by explaining the process of advocacy at USC.

“Student input is gathered through forums and meetings, student government meets with administrators [and] then there starts to be unsustainable change because we hear no responses — there is no action on their side and an incident occurs. It is a continual loop,” Sampath said. “That’s why we need your support to create sustainable activism and get the administration to make a commitment to reform USC.”
The resolution calls for a series of actions from the University administration, including the hiring of a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion and on additional Title IX investigator, a $100 million fund to support underrepresented students and tenured faculty positions for underrepresented minorities, additional resources for cultural centers and mandatory diversity and cultural competency training for graduate students, student leaders and faculty.
USG will vote on the resolution during their meeting next Tuesday.
She is a liar and I would never hire. She will be nothing but trouble.
Sampath needs to start answering the real questions. How much money has she made from recent television and media appearances regarding her story? Why has she refused to publicly name the house that “harassed” her? She has a very radical agenda that she wants to push on students on the campus.
So groups representing underrepresented students demand a $100 million fund be established to support underrepresented students. It’s a stick-up! lulz
USC Student Government President selective on application of racism on campus
UNIVERSITY MUST TAKE ACTION AGAINST RACIST HATE GROUP MEChA de USC!
AS A CONCERNED MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY I HAVE PREPARED THIS STATEMENT AS A DESI OPPOSING THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT’S SELECTIVE CALLS TO JUSTICE AGAINST RACISM!
The United States has long defended the pursuit of liberty against those driven by reckless hate, possessed by the worst of tyranny. Government by the people, for the people, is a moral imperative for any free society.
Yet across the campuses of the United State’s great academic institutions, an enemy of freedom lurks in the shadows of multiculturalism. The organization known as Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan is one of the largest student groups in the country. Under the guise of community service, MEChA has secured legitimacy and power in academic governments across the country, including USC and LA Trade Tech. 
Although considerable, MEChA’s philanthropy does not excuse its extreme and racist agenda. For too long MEChA has gone unanswered for the hateful proclamations of its founding document known as El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan. Created in 1969, this belligerent manifesto has been hailed as quintessential to MEChA philosophy in official documents recent as 2014 by MEChA de USC & Mecha de LA Trade Tech .
In short, El Plan de Aztlan calls for the seizure of the southwestern United States. In subscribing to this document, MEChA refuses to recognize American sovereignty, convinced the United States illegally occupies the ancient birthplace of the Aztecs, known as Aztlan: “Aztlan belongs to those who plant
the seeds, water the fields and gather the crops and not to the foreign Europeans. We don’t recognize capricious frontiers on the bronze continent. ” According to the plan, MEChA intends to revolt against our institutions and our way of life: “Lands rightfully ours will be fought for and defended. Land and realty ownership will be acquired by the community for the people’s welfare. Economic ties of responsibility must be secured by nationalism and the Chicano defense units.” 
MEChA’s plan promotes hate for the “gringo,”  as the organization looks upon Americans as evil invaders of its land: “Those institutions which are fattened by our brothers to provide employment and political pork barrels for the gringo will do so only as acts of liberation and for La Causa. For the very young there will no longer be acts of juvenile delinquency, but revolutionary acts.” 
Amazingly, MEChA has grown to significant numbers in recent years, infiltrating hundreds of colleges and high schools, brainwashing students with its sick racial fanaticism. Based upon a complete analysis of El Plan, it appears as if the organization’s ultimate goal seems to be a national division and violent race war. 
Like the Nazis, MEChA advocates ethnic nationalism as a call to arms, seeking political power outside the established institutions of this country. “Political liberation can only come through independent action on our part, since the two-party system is the same animal with two heads that feed from the same trough. Where we are a majority, we will control; where we are a minority, we will represent a pressure group; nationally, we will represent one party: La Familia de La Raza!” 
This is nothing short of a declaration of war as El Plan de Aztlan calls for the formation of a new apartheid regime in place of the United States government. “We declare the independence of our mestizo nation. We are a bronze people with a bronze culture. Before the world, before all of North America, before all our brothers in the bronze continent, we are a nation,we are a union of free pueblos, we are Aztlan. Por La Raza todo. Fuera de La Raza nada.” (Translation: “For the
race everything, for those outside the race nothing.” )
Conceived in hate, fueled by racism and fixed on treacherous revolution, MEChA is a danger to the intellectual and moral standing of USC and LA Trade Tech.
Ethnic segregation and racial nationalism are the ways of fascists and have no place at USC or LA Trade Tech. If MEChA does not publicly renounce the hateful proclamations of El Plan de Aztlan, then
its funding must be frozen and official status revoked. Like the Aryan Nations and the Ku Klux Klan, MEChA’s manifesto subscribes to a philosophy of racism, violence and treason.
The founding ideals of the United States, equality and justice, and the guiding principles of USC and LA Trade Tech, tolerance and diversity, are simply incompatible with MEChA’s beliefs. In this historic choice between tolerance and bigotry, we must hold MEChA accountable for its rhetoric, sending a clear and simple message: USC & LA Trade Tech are havens of learning, diversity and tolerance, not a front for racism, treason and fascism.
VIVA Donald Trump!
Hey biggestboss562, I just have one question for you: how does it feel to be so wrong? You don’t have to respond, and looking at your previous comments on other posts that feature Latina/os as well as your “VIVA Donald Trump” at the end of your message (which really was the icing on the cake), it’s really not worth my time and energy to engage with you. But just know that you are so very wrong, racist, xenophobic, and actual garbage.
Vanessa Diaz you are ignorant per your statement. I will publicly debate you or any illegal alien enabling group you are affiliated with. I will leave you with a quote from one of my favorite politicians, Pete Wilson, I love his authorization of CA Prop 187!  “I was right then, I’m right now. I think time has proven me right” – Pete Wilson

Spurred by the increase in campus shooting incidents in recent years, the Department of Public Safety has transitioned to a new protocol where officers immediately respond to active shooting situations on campus.
In the past, DPS officers would set up a perimeter around the shooting area until a SWAT team from LAPD arrived. Now, DPS officers will immediately engage in order to detain the shooter and tend to injured victims.
This decision was made mainly to provide a quicker response to an active shooter. The former protocol required DPS dispatchers to call in a LAPD SWAT team, located in downtown Los Angeles. According to Deputy Chief David Carlisle, it would take this team at least 20 minutes to gear up and drive to campus, during which time lives would be unnecessarily lost.
“A typical shooting situation lasts for three to five minutes total,” Carlisle said. “In that situation, time equals lives. We simply can’t afford to wait for LAPD to make it here.”
DPS officers are now expected to be prepared to respond to an active shooter situation at any time. In order to meet this expectation, the department puts each officer through Multiple Assault Counter-Terrorism Action Capabilities training. Every officer repeats the training annually, and the department carries out a variety of live-action training drills in campus buildings during University breaks.
MACTAC training teaches a variety of skills for handling a shooting situation, such as holding a formation when entering a building or breaking down a barricaded door. One of the main points emphasized in this training is specialized medical skills — such as how to make a tourniquet — so that officers can help stabilize victims until ambulances arrive on the scene.
“This is ongoing training, so it’s something that we want our officers to continue to repeat and relearn,” said Sergeant Ricardo Gonzalez, who is in charge of training DPS officers in MACTAC techniques. “Our focus has been on educating the officers so that they feel prepared. I think we’re ready.”
Though DPS will serve as the first responders on the scene, LAPD will still be called in to support DPS officers. The MACTAC training that DPS officers receive is the same training that LAPD officers receive for dealing with terrorist activity in the Los Angeles area. Both departments trained together over the summer in order to work together fluidly if an active shooter situation were to occur on campus.
These trainings teach officers to focus first on stopping the shooter, and then tending to victims’ medical needs. In another change to previous protocol, when ambulances are called to the scene, medical workers will be able to immediately enter the building. This decision was also made due to the necessity of a rapid response in order to save victims’ lives.
“In this type of situation, every minute matters,” Carlisle said. “We’re making adjustments that will hopefully cut down our response time so that we can be as effective as possible. It’s all about reacting and being able to react quickly.”
Even with these changes, Carlisle fears that DPS won’t be able to arrive quickly enough to stop the shooter, who will likely either flee the scene or commit suicide once police arrive. This means that students, staff and faculty must be equally trained in how to react to an active shooter situation. DPS has begun training faculty members using a program called “Run, Hide, Fight,” which earned its name from the three options any student or faculty member has during an active shooter situation. Its training involves developing spacial awareness of where a person can hide in a room and how to emotionally prepare for defending oneself against a shooter.
DPS is also offering to extend this training beyond faculty to student organizations. Carlisle said he and his department accept the fact that they can’t prevent a shooter situation, but they are continuing to seek out options to lower the risks and improve their response to such a crisis.
“This is a high-risk, low-likelihood situation,” Carlisle said. “But we have to take every precaution we can to keep our students and our faculty safe. We prepare for the worst, and then hope for the best — that we’ll never have to use this [training].”
I still have not heard a police/law enforcement officer speak out against guns.  Does any law enforcement officer and/or department support gun control?  Fire firefighters speak against the danger of fires (and fireworks are prohibited in many areas), doctors speak against the ills of bad diet and lack of exercise… do law enforcement officers not want to support a safer society (and “work environment” for themselves)?
“Carlisle said he and his department accept the fact that they can’t
prevent a shooter situation, but they are continuing to seek out options
 to lower the risks and improve their response to such a crisis.”
I would have to think that gun control would be one of those “options to lower the risks [of shooter situations]”

Water you waiting for? · Avery McEvoy, director of advocacy for ESA, speaks in front of Tommy Trojan on Tuesday afternoon. – Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
The Environmental Student Assembly hosted an event, “Water You Doing About the Drought,” Tuesday that encouraged students and faculty to decrease their water consumption and contribute to drought mitigation efforts.
Between noon and 2 p.m. in front of Tommy Trojan, ESA members displayed informational posters and several five-gallon jugs of water to illustrate the average amount of water used in performing different activities and making everyday products. Turning on air conditioners, for example, consumes five gallons of water every eight minutes; 500 gallons are required to produce a single hamburger patty.
The event drew a large crowd of supporters, many of whom signed pledges promising to reduce their personal “water footprints,” their total direct and indirect consumption.
Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
Some easy suggestions for curtailing water usage include taking shorter showers, only washing full loads of laundry and turning off faucets whenever possible.
Joy Ofodu, a sophomore majoring in communication who attended the event, said that she will use the shower timer that was given to her by USC Housing more often.
“It’s really helpful. You realize you don’t need any more time than [the timer] gives you,” Ofodu said.
Other suggestions included dietary changes.
“The best way [to limit water use] is to eat vegetarian,” said Avery McEvoy, director of advocacy for ESA.
McEvoy said this is because there are many indirect factors that go into livestock production, such as the water required to make the food they eat. McEvoy acknowledged, however, that consuming meat is a difficult habit for many to break.
The ESA is part of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, and was established in 2014 to advocate sustainability goals. Some of ESA’s events include the popular farmer’s market held on campus every Wednesday and its signature “Earth Month” awareness campaign in April. The organization meets weekly on Tuesdays in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
“Our goal is to merge the environmental community with the undergraduate student body as a whole,” said Elliott Wezerek, assistant director of ESA. “We want to create a green culture here at USC.”
Many Californians are well-aware of the drought’s severity and of the need for residents to sharply reduce their water footprints and have already experienced government-mandated restrictions on water use. USC itself must take steps to decrease its consumption by 16 percent per Los Angeles regulations.
USC Housing has already worked toward reaching this goal, installing low-flow showerheads and toilets, as well as more efficient washing machines in residence halls. Yet in order for these conservation efforts to succeed, students must ultimately bear the responsibility of cutting back on their water usage.
“We all have to be more mindful of when we’re wasting water,” said Cristian Guzman, an undeclared junior. “We have to re-examine whether or not we are actually using water wisely.”

An all-USC student film crew wrote, directed and produced a short film, Madaran, which is now being submitted to film festivals worldwide. The film follows the true story of an Iranian mother who has to decide whether or not to execute her son’s killer.
Rayka Zehtabchi, a senior majoring in film production, was inspired by the story when she first read about it in The Guardian. The story’s images stuck in her mind, and she was struck by the strength of the woman in the story, whose character resembled her mother in her resiliency and fragility. An Iranian-American herself, Zehtabchi was so moved by the story that she decided she had to make it a film.
“Both of my parents are Iranian, and so that was part of the reason I was so inspired with the story,” she said.  “The older I get, the more interested I become with my own culture and the more I want to be involved in it.”
Zehtabchi finally got the opportunity to write and workshop the script in one of her introduction to screenwriting courses. During the spring semester of 2015, Zehtabchi took CTPR 310: Intermediate Production with Rachel Ward, in which she had an assignment to write and direct a five-minute short film with a budget of $1,500. Having received positive feedback on her script, Zehtabchi chose to follow through with Madaran and officially make it a movie.
The day they were supposed to start the shoot, however, Zehtabchi’s father passed away after a long battle with cancer. The group had to cancel the project, and Zehtabchi left school to take a weeklong break. After returning to USC, she opted out of making the film, and instead, she did a scene study in which she analyzed one of her characters as if a journalist were interviewing them. However, Zehtabchi said something told her that she had to push through with her original idea.
“I didn’t want to miss out of making anything, even if I was in a very unsound mental state,” she said. “I wasn’t doing too well emotionally, but I decided I still wanted to make something, and I worked with some of my group mates to create the short film based on the film I originally wanted to make.”
Determined, Zehtabchi got together with a team of USC students to help her during the summer. Avery Regen and Nicholas de Bellis, both seniors majoring in film and television production were the producers; Sam Davis, a senior majoring in film and television production, was the cinematographer and editor; and Adrian Ehlman, a senior majoring in film and television production served as sound designer. Mehrdad Sarlak, a graduate of MIT, was the executive producer.
Though Zehtabchi personally identified with the story because of her Iranian descent, her group members felt just as passionate.
“Rayka is my friend, and what happened was really horrible. She didn’t get to make the film she wanted to make,” Regen said. “We had that chance, so she should have the chance, too. It was a really good idea, and it was really well thought out.”
Because the movie was shot outside of the classroom and after the class had ended, the group could not enjoy the usual perks SCA students get from USC. Without access to cameras, lights, insurance or the computer lab, the students had to rely on themselves and the principles they have learned in class to make their project a reality.
“Things were a little bit more real world and less academic, so there was more pressure to perform and to do well,” de Bellis said.
With the help of SCA faculty and staff, the group started a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $6,000. The students scouted for actors and ended up with a cast and crew of more than 80 people, most of them of Iranian descent. They shot the movie in San Pedro and edited it throughout the summer of 2015. The group has recently submitted it to various international film festivals, including the Sundance Film Festival, hoping it will open doors for them.
Madaran was created as a proof of concept film, a short film with the intention of eventually becoming a feature length film.  The group hopes that they can get funded with a budget that is much larger and that they can eventually turn their short film into a longer movie.

We saw flashes of brilliance from USC last Saturday. Adoree’ Jackson’s long touchdown catch, Jalen Greene’s first touchdown, Juju    Smith–Schuster’s creative lateral to Jackson on a kickoff return. It was a taste of all the talent USC has on its roster, of all the potential USC has to blow teams out of the water.
But we also saw a lot of instances where the Trojans were, quite frankly, outmatched. This year’s Trojan squad is a great team, but Notre Dame showed that it too was a very talented group. At the end of the day, it wasn’t the distractions from a crazy week, or the incompetency of the coaching staff, that was the difference between victory and defeat for the Trojans. For the first time all season, with all due respect to Stanford and Washington, it really looked like USC was beaten by a more talented team.
It’s hard to calculate what impact the off-the-field distractions and coaching change had on the game. But it wouldn’t have been that surprising if USC had lost 41-31 to Notre Dame if Steve Sarkisian was still the head coach and there wasn’t a recurrence of his personal issues in the middle of the season.
The reaction certainly would have been different. Instead of praising the players for overcoming adversity and giving their best effort in a tough situation, we’d be calling it another bad loss under the disappointing Sark era.
Of course, we shouldn’t hold Clay Helton to same standard after one week of preparation. When Ed Orgeron had his first game as an interim head coach two years ago, he at least had a sort of bye week. Orgeron’s first game wasn’t until the Thursday night the week after he took over. When Helton took over for Oregeron as interim head coach the first time, Helton had the usual bowl game preparation time to set up a game plan. When Helton was named the interim head coach for the second time on Sunday, Oct. 11, he only had six days before his first game.
But the problem against Notre Dame wasn’t the game plan. The Trojans brought a balanced attack of passing and running, plus a pair of trick plays. The problem was not stopping the Fighting Irish.
As previously discussed in this space, there’s been a lot of criticism of defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, especially given the relatively poor results of the defense in two of the team’s three losses. The criticism is usually that Wilcox is too conservative, doesn’t blitz enough and plays too much zone coverage.
But if I had any criticism of the scheme from Saturday, it would be for not doing those things enough. The problem wasn’t that Notre Dame had too much time to build drives; the problem was USC got beat over the top on a bunch of big plays.
Jackson’s touchdown catch and run was fantastic, and really changed the dynamic of the game. But defensively, the touchdown pass he let up to Will Fuller basically negated that. It was a play where the Trojans were in man-to-man defense, there wasn’t help over the top from the safeties and Jackson just got beat. For someone as athletic as Jackson to just get outplayed like that shows how athletic Fuller is.
That was only the second time Jackson was burned by Fuller. During the Irish’s game-tying drive, Jackson needed to commit a pass interference penalty to stop Fuller from another touchdown catch, but that drive — which featured another major pass interference on a long ball — ultimately did end in seven points. Throw in another big 45-yard pass to Fuller in single coverage to set up the Irish’s last field goal, plus USC getting burned on a double pass during a touchdown drive — which maybe the Trojans should have seen coming, but the Irish must have practiced one all week and their defense still bit on USC’s —and that’s 24 points the defense could have prevented with more conservative coverage.
Irish quarterback DeShone Kizer was sacked four times but also showed a fair amount of mobility and certainly wasn’t picking apart USC’s zone coverage. Bringing more pressure would have just made the Trojans more vulnerable to big plays.
Offensively, it’s easy to look at the end of the game and say USC didn’t have enough of a sense of urgency. And granted, on the final drive of the game, Cody Kessler probably did go to his check-downs too many times instead of airing it out. But the real problem was the two interceptions he had earlier in the game. One of them was a deflected ball in relatively tight coverage; one of them was a spectacular play by an Irish defensive back. All in all, credit to the Irish secondary for causing the turnovers rather than blame Kessler for not showing up in the big game when it mattered most. If Kessler really pushed it more on the final drive, the Trojans would have had a marginally better chance of coming back, but he was more likely to have just ended up with a third interception.
With all that being said, USC can still win the Pac-12 South. There’s no doubt in my mind that USC can upset Utah this weekend. No. 3 still seems awfully high for Utah given the lack of attention it had going into the season, but the Utes have earned their way to first place in the South division standings. If USC can win that game and see Utah lose one more time in conference, the Trojans then control their destiny to the conference title game, as hard as that is to believe.
Regardless of the game plan, the playcalling, or who is deciding those two, the Trojans will face teams that are on par or better than them talent wise. Even for a school as proud as USC, that will be true against teams like Notre Dame with comparable tradition and teams like Utah without it. That’s just the landscape of college football. So each loss doesn’t need to be a crushing blow to our reputation or recruiting abilities. And despite all the drama, the Trojans still have the chance to make their mark in the conference race.

Under center · Quarterbacks Max Browne (left) and Cody Kessler (right) lead the team in the wake of the third coaching change in as many years. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Despite their three and three start to the season, the Trojans practiced with one goal Tuesday — to win the Pac-12 South title.
The team’s demeanor in practice parallels their dedication to interim head coach Clay Helton, who has remained optimistic about the season. The players’ impressive effort Tuesday signified that Helton has inspired them to the extent that they view him as USC’s head coach in the future.
“I think right now, my plan is for Helton to be the head coach, and I think that everyone on board is the same way,” said redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Browne. Browne, who just applied to graduate school, said that USC is “100 percent” where he will be playing in his collegiate future. “Everyone except for [Athletic Director] Pat [Haden] is kind of on the same page with that, and we’ve got to go out there and win some ball games. But it’s one week at a time, and we’re taking it from there.”
The Trojans have relied on Helton and veteran player leadership to guide them through this difficult time. Seniors, who have been through numerous coaching changes at USC already, have taken it upon themselves to create a culture of resilience on the team.
“As long as leaders such as myself are confident — as long as Cody Kessler is confident and JuJu Smith-Schuster is confident — the other guys will follow their leadership,” right tackle Zach Banner said. “It starts with the coach. Coach Helton has the best personality in college football. He’s really confident. We have six more games coming up that we have to win. And you know what? I am as confident as he is, so everything underneath me is the same.”
Banner said that as disappointing as their record may be, the team is still excited about their position in the conference. He added that USC’s goals start with beating a “monster” Pac-12 South opponent this week in   No. 3 Utah.
“We know if we win out one week at a time that our chances are pretty high of winning that South title,” Banner said.
“The guys inspired me today. Coming out here and having practiced like that after a tough loss, you can tell when and how much they want to win and represent the Trojan Family,” Helton said. “They want to get better as a team. We truly believe we are a great team, and that is something we’re really going to need as we prepare to play a good Utah team.”
Because the receiving corps has been depleted by injuries, wide receivers coach Tee Martin has had to utilize talents such as cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who wore a red offensive practice jersey today, and ex-quarterback Jalen Greene at the wide out position.
Receivers Darreus Rogers, who left in the second half of the Notre Dame game with a hamstring injury, and Steven Mitchell Jr., who did not play because of his ankle, did not practice on Tuesday.
“The thing about Jalen [Greene] is that he is really intelligent, and we try to utilize all of his talent: throwing the ball a couple times this year and obviously as a receiver,” Martin said.
Helton added that Jackson, who exemplified his speed during an electric 83-yard touchdown Saturday, would play a “major roll” in the USC offense for the rest of the season.
“Whenever he touches the ball, everyone holds their breath, and that gives us a great advantage on offense,” Helton said.
Similar opportunities have arisen for freshmen such as slot receiver Deontay Burnett, who stepped up and performed in his first start at USC. Burnett, who made notable catches against the Irish, hopes that his production when on the field will prove that he can be a “big-time player” who will not “shy away from the moment” when given the chance.
“It was a surreal moment for me. Just getting my first start at USC and having a few big catches in a big time rivalry game was amazing,” said Burnett, who had three catches for 53 yards. “I felt like I was overlooked because of all the talent, but I didn’t let that stop me from working and keeping a good work ethic. I knew I had the mindset that I can play here.”
Offensive tackle Chad Wheeler did not practice because of concussion-like symptoms. Safety John Plattenburg, tight end Taylor McNamara and linebacker Michael Hutchings did not practice due to illness. Tailback Tre Madden did not practice again because of a sore knee.
“This team is practicing their butts off. There is no quit in them, and that is what we stress. We are going to fight on through every game of the season,” Helton said. “These guys compete and they want to show the world how good they are. You really get worried if you come out here and they are not chippy and they don’t have that madness in them when they go play.”
Like two of USC’s losses this season, the Trojans’ loss to Notre Dame will not impede their ability to compete for a Pac-12 South title — which gives USC players the fight to persevere through a stunning coaching change and two straight losses.
Helton said that Notre Dame’s defense was similar to that of Arizona State in that they constantly loaded the box, which prompted USC to pass and Kessler to accumulate more than 365 yards passing. Though Helton noted that USC put up significantly higher offensive numbers than many of Notre Dame’s previous opponents, he admitted that it wasn’t enough.
“At the end of the day, it is our responsibility as a coaching staff to do what is best for our players to put points on the board and outscore our opponent,” Helton said. “We did not Saturday. We needed to find a way to get 42.”
Helton acknowledged that eliminating “critical mistakes” such as blocked punts, missed field goals and penalties were heavily emphasized in today’s practice.
“I’ve been here six years now. And you know Los Angeles, you know USC, you know the Trojan Family and you know that the expectations are to win and that is what we are going to do,” Helton said. “We look forward to having a great second half of the season. I know exactly what the job entails and what the job demands, and I’m excited everyday I wake up to coach these guys because there is no quit in these guys and there is no quit in me.”

Night of Inspirational and Soulful Expression, otherwise known as NOISE, hosted by USC’s Saved By Grace Gospel Choir, is an annual evening of artistry that focuses on displaying the talent present in the USC community. The event will include an opening act by the gospel choir, followed by performances from passionate students all over campus with acts including singing, spoken word, monologues and dance.
“NOISE is a night to inspire fellow Trojans,” said Ashley Siris, co-director of Saved By Grace. “Through spoken word, original songs and new interpretations of popular songs, NOISE gives Trojans a platform to freely express themselves and allows those who witness the event to share in a spiritually moving experience while here at USC.”
Though hosted by a gospel choir, NOISE is open to people of all races, religions and walks of life. Additionally, NOISE is a an event that touches on various topics, including issues relating to social justice; however, it focuses primarily on the meaningful expression of oneself, whether or not topics are related to social issues.
“All types of expression are welcome and displayed in our show. The USC student body is also socially conscious so we do have acts that speak out on the injustices that are present nationally and internationally,” said Saved By Grace member Ify Anene. “However, what ultimately determines the selection of certain acts within our show is if we see that it reflects soulful and truthful expression of oneself.”
The Saved By Grace Gospel Choir is the only gospel choir at USC that welcomes individuals from all backgrounds. The musical ensemble was founded in 1998 under the name USC Gospel Choir. A student organization under the Black Student Assembly, the gospel choir aims to “raise Christian awareness through worship and spiritual fellowship.”
The choir performs every year at various campus events such as Trojan Family Weekend, SChristian Connection and the Black and Latino Symposium. In the past, the group has released records such as 15 Years of Music & Ministry, a compilation of two modern arrangements of classic church hymns.
With the purpose of inspiring and connecting people together, this night of soulful expression will be an event that will leave a lasting impression on the USC community. Not only does it open the student body’s eyes to the wealth of talent here on campus, but it also connects completely different individuals together to hear about universal themes and meaningful topics. The NOISE event is an opportunity for students to participate in an exciting night of expression and diversity, while supporting talented gospel choir singers in the community.
NOISE will take place Wednesday at Ground Zero Performance Café from 7-9 p.m.

Located Downtown in the Santa Fe Building on 6th Street and Main Street, The Main Barre has an immediate cool factor. The street was bustling with city sounds and nighttime energy when I arrived at the building for my 7:15 p.m. class. I was buzzed in the door and made my way to the elevator, expecting the studio to be a calm oasis in the middle of Downtown. Instead, I could hear music blasting as I rode the elevator up to the fourth floor studio.
Audra Skaates welcomed me into the studio, and I was amazed at the space — a beautiful loft with a grand view of the city’s skyline. The lights were dim, and an instructor was teaching a small class on the barre. The studio really was an oasis in the middle of the city’s cacophony, even with the blasting music.
Skaates opened the studio just after graduating from college. She was familiar with the area, as she spent her days teaching barre at other studios and nights bartending Downtown; Skaates jokes that her friends often tell her she went from one bar to the next. Despite initial reservations about the location, Skaates was eager to open her own place, and fell in love with the location. She saw the opening in the Santa Fe Building, brainstormed names for the studio during her shift at the bar, submitted her application when she got home that night and heard back from the building just hours later. With that, Skaates had opened the first barre studio in Downtown.
Part of what helped The Main Barre succeed during its formative years was Skaates’s tenacity and passion for her new studio. Determined to make The Main Barre a success, Skaates threw herself into the business side, handing out flyers and business cards and creating relationships with nearby businesses and clients. Though Skaates admits she wears many hats, her enterpreneurial spirit and ability to make relationships are what keep the studio a success today. Skaates knows almost every client’s name — if they’re a new face, she makes sure to introduce herself. The combination of her bubbly personality and passion for fitness is completely enchanting, and is a characteristic that is evident in her attitude toward her staff and her students.
The instructor of my class, Liz, immediately introduced herself when I walked in the door with a bubbly enthusiasm that mirrored Skaates’s. I hadn’t done barre before, so I was filled with both excitement and nerves; I knew from other classes that I wasn’t very flexible but was confident that I’d be able to keep up. Liz gave me the basics of what would happen in the class and told me not to worry if my legs shook during an exercise — that was a good thing. I wasn’t worried, as I didn’t think anything could be worse than the pilates class I had taken a few weeks earlier.
I chose a spot in the back corner, close to the mirrors so I could watch and follow the others in the class; little did I know my location became a benefit so I could watch myself too. Surprised to see two sets of weights next to my mat, it immediately became clear that this class would be more physically intense than I imagined. Liz started the class off with some stretching, incorporating several ballet moves and positions that brought me back to the dance class I had when I was six. The weights came into play during the arm section of the class, which incorporated more arm workouts than I knew existed. The end of the arm exercises was a welcome relief until Liz instructed us that it was time for legs.
The studio has two different barres, one for more experienced and adventurous students, and one for me. I am not flexible, so I took the opportunity to use the lower barre. The rest of the class effortlessly swung their legs onto the barres. I, on the other hand, carefully assisted my stiff leg into the same position, trying my best to hide my strain. Liz then had us do several leg exercises, as we folded our bodies into several positions, incorporating bands and balls into the workout. Though I was initially excited to use the exercise balls — they reminded me of dodgeballs in middle school — it quickly became clear that this was going to be the part of the workout I struggled with most. The rest of the class looked graceful and seemed to hold their ball between their knees with ease, while I was constantly adjusting my ball to keep it in place. This is where my experience with dodgeball actually came in handy, as I discreetly caught my falling ball several times before it hit the ground. It didn’t help that despite my initial confidence at the beginning of class, my legs were shaking like leaves.
I was most excited for the core exercises, which came next, as they’re my favorite part of my usual workout. We once again used the exercise balls, this time putting them behind our backs for some crunches and curls. I had fun toward the beginning of this section, as I kept up pretty well with Liz and the experienced students — until the workout continued. We did more curls. We did curls with our legs bent, with our legs extended, with our legs in the air and with legs alternating. I could not have been happier when Liz dimmed the lights, turned down the pop music she had been blasting and announced it was time to rest, relax and stretch. I took a minute to reflect the class and came to a conclusion: Though I definitely wasn’t a dancer, I wanted that dancer’s body. And I knew that The Main Barre would give it to me. In my one class, I fell in love with barre, the challenge it posed and the environment Skaates had created.
A single class at The Main Barre costs $20, with various other packages offered. The studio provides morning and evening classes Monday through Friday, as well as a few morning classes on weekends. Currently three different classes are offered for a variety of workouts: The Main Body, Candlelight Flow and Rock Hard Glutes & Abs.

After parting ways with his brothers Kevin and Nick and coming back from his 2011 solo album Fastlife, Joe Jonas is back in the music industry with a new sound and crew. His new band DNCE features Jonas as frontman, drummer Jack Lawless, guitarist JinJoo Lee and keyboardist/bassist Cole Whittle. The group encompasses a James Brown-esque vibe with its 1970s soul and funk sound in their first single, “Cake by the Ocean,” which was released on iTunes Sept. 18. The rest of DNCE’s album, SWAAY EP, is set to be released this Friday.
Jonas describes the band’s sound as a “silky, swaggering piece of groove-heavy pop built on disco-jangly riffs but saturated with plenty of pure emotion and undeniable soul.” The Los Angeles-based artists came together this past summer as “the next best thing for when you’re too drunk to spell ‘dance.’” Using Earth, Wind & Fire as inspiration for their R&B rhythm, DNCE strives to make their music the life of the party, mixing different beats to create a unified sound that transcends any club to make the audience feel like one, similar to the four different personas maintained in the band.
Known for being the former lead guitarist for Jordin Sparks, Lee starred as the opening act for the Jonas Brothers’ world tour in 2009. She arose as a self-taught prodigy who played for her older siblings’ band, POS and even performed with Jonas during his 2011 Fastlife tour. Lee also performed alongside musicians Charli XCX and CeeLo Green through which she learned to contribute her unique sound to a larger collection of talent.
Lawless, another ex-tourmate of Jonas, developed such an infatuation with playing drums that he withdrew from college and substituted for the Jonas Brothers’ drummer who quit during their 2006 tour. Later, Lawless was promoted to the band’s full-time drummer.
Unlike the other two, Whittle got his start separate from the Jonas Brothers as he and his roommate from the Berklee College of Music founded a band, Semi Precious Weapons. Whittle’s band turned from an underground party band to Lady Gaga’s special guest for her 2009 to 2011 Monster Ball tour. Before forming DNCE, Lee, Lawless and Whittle’s talents all landed them huge gigs with established artists.
As for the former Jonas Brother, Joe is said to have been formulating this group project for the last five to six years, but needed “time to hit the reset button and figure out what [he] wanted to do next.” After the Jonas Brothers broke up in 2013, he gravitated toward DJing as he performed under the pseudonym “DJ Danger” from nightclubs in Las Vegas to Lollapalooza in Chicago last year. Two years after he publicly launched his career, he transitioned from electronic dance music to a disco-inspired, soul sensation that emerged from “Cake by the Ocean” and will likely surface in the remaining tracks of the EP.
Jonas reveals that the inspiration behind “Cake by the Ocean” was from a realization that “his Swedish collaborators Mattman & Robin had misspoken the name of a tropical cocktail — what they were really after was Sex on the Beach.” Despite the miscommunication, this single’s infectious beats convey a message that promotes “the shedding of self-consciousness,” as Jonas put it. SWAAY EP aims to push its listeners past their comfort zone. The music captivates the audience with the fluidity of its pop, disco and soul components, almost as relaxing as the actual tropical cocktail.

In an unassuming building on Spring Street lies an elegant French paradise in what was once the lobby of the Hotel Stowell, a trendy hotel Charlie Chaplin called home when he was just starting his acting career. Le Petit Paris opened barely a month ago, but it is already making a name for itself as the “most French” restaurant in Los Angeles.
Cannes restaurateurs Fanny and David Rolland brought new life to the historic building while maintaining its most distinctive features. The iron bass doors hide rows of small cafe tables covered in generously sized wine glasses and bottles of olive oil. Large, donut-shaped crystal chandeliers sparkle overhead. A grand staircase leads patrons to an even more stylish second floor with a bar and plenty of comfortable armchairs to lounge in if a table is too formal. Red velvet chairs at the bar create an inviting atmosphere unlike the more uptight French establishments around town. The portrait next to the downstairs bar of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby toasting viewers with a martini will surely make patrons feel like they’re in the company of friends.
The beauty of the restaurant is in the details. From the fresh red roses decorating each table to pink salt next to the pepper, Le Petit Paris spared no expense in presentation. Small black lamps with laser cutouts of the Eiffel Tower sets the mood downstairs. Batchelder tiles from the Hotel Stowell complement the gold crown molding of the black pillars. It may sound like a lot to take in — and it is at first — but the space is large and surprisingly not claustrophobic.
Le Petit Paris’ website offers reservations, but there were plenty of tables open downstairs. The second floor is only open for dinner. The brunch selection ranges from the usual suspects — organic eggs and French toast — to full dinner entrees such as salmon, burgers and steak. Mimosas, various hot beverages and freshly squeezed juices are also available.
The sweet smell of the French toast reached the table before the plate did. Two pieces of French toast were adorned with fresh berries and powdered sugar and served with a sweet, whipped butter and syrup. The toast was soft and surprisingly not dry. Though the cultural authenticity of French toast is up for debate, the tastiness of Le Petit Paris’s version is not.
For a lighter, though still equally filling meal, the assorted fresh fruit platter is a great option. The dish looks small but it is deeply filled with cut fruit. There are also freshly squeezed green juice options with avocado, spinach and pineapple. However, with chocolate crepes on the menu, fruit might not be the most attractive option.
The salmon steak was the final dish and the only one that was more fitting for lunch than breakfast. Despite the menu not stating anything other than what the plate would have, there was an assumption that the meal would have, well, more. The salmon was paired with a small sprinkling of vegetables and a delectable white lemon sauce that deserves its own standing ovation. The fish was cooked to perfection; however, the portion size was very small. It was easily finished in four bites. Perhaps that would not have been the case if the salmon were average. It was amazing but gone far too soon.
It’s no secret that the Americans are obsessed with the French, and Le Petit Paris plays with that fact. The restaurant’s beauty is in the details, from the history to the decor to the menu options. The food isn’t overpriced and is well worth it for the taste. The staff was very pleasant and attentive without being pushy despite the lack of patrons dining in the restaurant. Le Petit Paris, located in a nice little corner of Downtown, embodies everything people admire about the French.

The ongoing civil conflict in Syria has displaced thousands of Syrians and forced them to flee their homes to traverse across borders, only to be met with backlash and violence. More than 7.6 million have been displaced within Syria’s borders and more than 4 million have fled the country, seeking refuge all over the world, mainly in Europe. The Obama administration has pledged to take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees for the fiscal year. But despite being one of the world’s wealthiest countries, the United States takes relatively few refugees.
Instead of turning away Syrians, the United States should welcome them with open arms —  not only on a humanitarian basis, but also on a diplomatic basis that will improve the reputation of the United States in the Middle East, an area that has historically viewed the U.S. in a negative light. On a local scale, a growing number of refugees have been relocated to California, including Los Angeles. As residents of L.A., the USC community has a responsibility to make accommodations to provide these refugees with funds, care packages and welcome arms.
A total of 1,500 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States since the start of the civil war in 2011. Fifty refugees have been relocated to the Sacramento area, 53 to San Diego and 19 to Los Angeles. Though President Obama has agreed to admit at least 10,000 refugees, this is a small number compared to other wealthy European countries such as Germany (800,000), Serbia and Kosovo (52,000+) and Sweden (80,000+). Neighboring countries of Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have accepted million of refugees, but due to economic and political instability, refugees are forced to relocate to safer buffer zones that will provide food and shelter.
However, an increasing number of clashes at European borders has prompted policymakers to dispatch riot police. Refugees are also receiving backlash from locals who are reporting refugees to police. Others attempt to profit from refugees by selling them tents and other supplies instead of donating out of a sense of basic human decency.
The United States should be a role model for humanitarianism to show that it has learned from the past. Unfortunately, history repeats itself — the United States turned away thousands of Jews during the Holocaust and now we are accepting an allotted amount of Syrians and turning away the rest of them in a modern-day genocide.
The resettlement of refugees in the United States is a long, complicated process. Syrian refugees are subject to intense interrogation to ensure they do not pose security threats, which rests on the assumption that all Syrians are potential terrorists. Perhaps the problem is the hypersensitivity Americans have toward Muslims and terrorism. The correlation to bigotry is based on the association of religious principles.
The Syrian narrative is one of irrefutable hardships and tests of survival caused by evacuation from a war-stricken, broken country that will take many years to mend. Many refugees fleeing to Europe by sea face capsized boats, stolen money and starvation along the journey to freedom.
Refugees arrive here with little to nothing, carrying their belongings on their backs and pleading for their lives. It is unfair, unethical and inhumane for the privileged to ignore the problem. Once the refugees arrive, a caseworker helps them attain Social Security cards, apply for food stamps and sign up for medical services. They are also enrolled in employment preparation programs and classes acquainting them with U.S. customs. L.A. has one of the largest Syrian communities in the United States, making it a great place for refugees to settle.
A majority of the USC community is privileged, and as a student body, we can make tremendous efforts to support Syrian refugees in L.A. The best way to help is to donate and, volunteer with committees that directly help the refugees. The International Rescue Committee of Los Angeles helps with refugee resettlement, providing immediate aid, immigration services, education and more. On campus, Ansar Service Partnership, a Muslim community service organization, is holding a Syrian refugee fundraiser on Thursday. Service clubs like the Ansar Service Partnership are easy to get involved with. If change does not take place on a political level, it is our duty as citizens to rebuild the social framework of our communities through welfare programs, which directly affect those who need it the most.
The USA is already a model of humanitarian. The USA borrows more annually than it sends out in foreign aid. There is no government budget to help these refugees. No only does the USA have the most debt in the world, increasingly no one outside the Federal reserve wants to buy new debt! Is the plan to have the city of Los Angeles default on pensions to help refugees? Money in LA does not magically appear for refugees. The city budget is full of trade offs.
These people seem like victims at first. Soon you’ll see them come and settle in with tax payer money, the government will not inform them enough about the separation of church and state and how secular governments treat religion. They’ll get mad when they can’t practice Syria’s version of Sharia law and it will enrage their youth to join terrorist groups like ISIS. This is the cycle of Muslim immigrants. They come but they don’t want to understand. They simply want to plant their medieval culture and refuse ours while enjoying the benefits our western culture provides. We can’t continue to absorb these people and the problems they bring. No thanks! 
To all you Syrian refugees. Go to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, or UAE and if they don’t accept you, you’ll discover just how good Allah is as well as your Muslim brethren. Then when you come to an epiphany, you can renounce your religion and join the secular western world.
The incidence of rape in Sweden has skyrocketed since the liberal democrats passed immigration reform ten years ago as has the incidence of violent crime.  Malmo, Sweden is no longer safe for Jews.
In France there are large no-go zones thanks to Muslim immigration and the incidence of anti-Semitism is unlike anything seen since WWII.
Muslim immigration in Germany is putting a massive strain on Germany’s financial system.  In the US female genital mutilation is skyrocketing as is polygamy.  Demands for halal meat and for Sharia law are unrelenting and Sharia law is even being used in many Muslim communities creating a two-tiered legal system – one for Muslims that is entirely inconsistent with British law.
Muslims, generally speaking, have little interest in embracing our values and freedoms.  Mostly they are interested in subverting our ways and replacing them with theirs.  
We should help the Syrian refugees:  The Christian ones for they will be forever thankful, productive members of our societies.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace
– will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an
alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that
emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a
band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.
ìi
Why are they not going to a Muslim
country as they already are flooding Europe, go to Holland and see what is happening.  Who is to say there is not going to be some problems down
the road with the strong beliefs they have as if you are not a Muslin than you dead.
Watch out for the bad ones that
Blow themselves up and take good
people with them that’s what I am
afraid of.
A better question would be why can’t a rich Arab country help out?…like Bahrain,Oman,Saudi Arabia,or UAE.They are invaders not refugees!!!!! And where are the women and children?…. This is a Trojan horse don’t be fooled people.
The rich Muslim countries refuse to take in the Syrian refugees because they want them to emigrate to Europe and North America to further spread Islam. The future culture wars in Europe (and perhaps the U.S.) will be brutal and deadly.
why aren’t they going to China,Russian or India?
We can’t even take care of our Veterans in a timely fashion as this Country is so broke nor our own citizens being homeless and a much needed System for the Mentally ill.
President Obama says bring the refugees in and make it thousands and thousands.  I say does he know
how to count.  Surely he knows some math, so that being said does he plan to pay for these refugees welfare with his own money?  Excuse me President Obama but it sounds like you are dumping the cost on American People again.  While you were President you had power to close the border with Mexico and no
you let them flood California and they
kept going.
I am very sorry I voted for you!
I wonder what would happen if things were reversed ….

The author missed out on the really good reason for the USA to accept  more refugees from Syria.
These refugees are fleeing a war between “good Jihadis” ( according to the US government) bad Jihadis  (according to the US government) and the Syrian armed forces.
These “bad jihadis” came into being in Iraq after the “liberation ” of Iraq by G W Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their followers.
If that idiotic clown from Texas had not been given the power ( by the US voters) to go out and destroy a complete country
(Iraq ) it’s infrastructure and law enforcement authorities this would not have happened.
So,…… you guys caused the problem, now you own it.
Time to step up to the plate ( as you guys love to say) and accept ownership !
Do not get sucked in with the “humanitarian” aspects of this dumb proposition. ISLAM will never be in accordance with Western Democratic values. Accept only apostates and deport those that practice and promote ISLAM.
You have to consider this article was written by a girl named Erum. Persians, who generally have an easier time coexisting with secularism, probably think they can expect the same from their Arab counterparts. Not so. Nonetheless, this rhetoric is everywhere though. Journalists and progressives in America always mention the cliche, “we always accept refugees, that’s just what America does”, or “we’re a melting pot and therefore they’re entitled to come under any circumstances!”. Beyond cliche, these statements are really obnoxious. It’s to say that America’s majority is not allowed have any objectivity and has to abide by these principals in order to live up to some reputation of tolerance and multiculturalism. It also implies that we cant adjust our principals based on the climate of our country’s immigration problems and mitigate these things before they get out of hand.
Great sob story about the plight of refugees, but you ignore one thing. Islam breeds terrorists. It’s in their book. Refugees would perhaps be more readily welcomed if they didn’t come with an agenda to Islamise their host countries. No sane person wants neighbours who belong to a religion (the only religion) whose followers go about killing in the name of their ‘god’ claiming justification of their scriptures. I know the claim that most are moderate – but how can we tell who they are?
Here’s an idea – accept only those refugees who publically renounce Islam & deport them if they change their mind.
Please, give us an in context quote from said book where they should be terrorist.
He can’t. He’s just heard a few buzz words from Fox News and Rush Limbaugh. 
Quran 9:5
I figured that’s what you’d say. That’s what you guys always say. 
This verse was revealed towards the end of the revelation period and relates to a limited context. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious. One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur’an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur’an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. 
So again, you’ve only heard a few buzz words like all the others like you always do.
Also, don’t think for a minute that the Bible doesn’t have similar verses that, when taken of context, are just as sinister. 
I FIGURED THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD SAY. Funny thing is that the terrorists disagree with you. And so does Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi and his followers. Not to mention the perpetrators of a terrorist act recently committed in my own country by followers of the paedophile ‘prophet’. It appears that convoluted textual obfuscation has apparently escaped Muslim understanding for the past 1400 years and is now trotted out in a vain attempt to give Islam some legitimacy. The evidence of the fruit of Islam is plain for all to see – even someone like you – so wake up. Islam has nothing of value to offer anyone. I suggest you leave it and bring you kids up under any other religion and at least avoid the possibility of them also becoming terrorists. If you think Islam is a peaceful  religion (choke) then you had better spend your energy telling Muslims where they have got it wrong. Meanwhile I will to continue to judge Islam by the evidence I see in the world media and by the activity of terrorists at home.
The word you’re looking for is “Pedophile.” It’s  difficult to take someone seriously when they can’t be bothered to spell words correctly.  I didn’t at any time say Islam is the religion of peace. There is no religion of peace and my son will decide on his own what religion to follow if any at all. I follow none of them. Christianity has nothing of value to offer anyone. You were asked to bring up a quote with context and you failed.
The spelling is correct – just not US English. You need to get out more. The context that I gave you is the reality of the daily outworking of the paedophile prophet’s so called religion. No point recycling tired Muslim theological arguments when the fruit is obvious to all. Christianity is at least valid (evidenced through fulfilled prophecy). No instructions to kill or subjugate anyone in Christianity. Old Testament doesn’t count since mention of war, killing etc. are obviously historical descriptive not prescriptive.
Lol. You’re one of those folks that says “Old Testament doesn’t count.”‘ Your Bible isn’t all peaches and sunshine. The old Testament counts when you want to use the Bible to justify hating someone or something. 
Thought you might be.
Bring something new to your same old tired argument and you might be more fun.

When I proposed the idea of a column based on freedoms at universities, my editor and I both felt that we were taking a risk on finding enough material to run a biweekly column. However, it appears that freedom of speech has become a rather fashionable topic in media narratives concerning college campuses in America. From a CNN opinion piece back in March regarding the expulsion of University of Oklahoma fraternity members caught singing racist chants on video, to the coddled co-eds narrative so carefully crafted by The Atlantic, and the discourse that followed, to, most recently, another piece published by The Atlantic, “The Anti-Free Speech Movement at UCLA,” mainstream media outlets have begun to lament the tragic death of free speech at the hand of liberal students on college campuses across the nation.
That free speech is under attack on college campuses is an idea perpetuated without regard to the context of the subject and the power dynamics that require the protection of liberties in the first place. For actual students on college campuses, these instances in which their voices take on a new dimension of power are small but hard-fought victories.
Let’s return to the most recent instance at UCLA. On Oct. 6, the UCLA chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon hosted a “Kanye Western” themed party for which many dressed in some variation of a Kanye West or Kim Kardashian costume. Many students, largely organized by the Black Bruins (Afrikan Student Union), protested this dress code as a blatant appropriation of black culture that perpetuates harmful stereotypes. In response, university administration suspended social activities for the greek organizations that co-hosted the events. In the article published by The Atlantic, this suspension is viewed as evidence of an egregious transgression of free speech, the edge of the slippery slope down on which all civil liberties have begun to slide in higher education institutions across America.
In other words, the social calendar of a fraternity and a sorority is apparently more crucial to civil liberties at a university than the voices of its underrepresented black students. The university’s response to the widespread protests of its students, from whom it charges roughly $13,000 a year each for tuition and fees, is somehow a threat to First Amendment rights everywhere. When we act like freedom of speech is under attack because greek organizations are put on social probation for hosting events with racist overtones, we completely lose sight of the true beauty and power of free speech as a protected liberty.
Perhaps the most confounding aspect of The Atlantic’s “Anti-Free Speech Movement at UCLA” piece is author Conor Friedersdorf’s suggestion that the student protests stem from a naive ignorance of the activist legacy that shaped their campus. He writes, “A half-century ago, student activists at the University of California clashed with administrators during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, a series of events that would greatly expand free-speech rights of people at public colleges and universities.” Friedersdorf refers to the protests against the Kanye Western party as “UC student activists [squandering] their inheritance.”
Apparently unbeknownst to Friedersdorf, another very important chapter of UC student activism a half-century ago, especially at UCLA, was the foundation of groups such as the Afrikan Student Union itself. One visit to the Black Bruins’ webpage would have informed him about the union’s foundation in 1966, influenced by the ideology of the influential UCLA Black Panther Party — UCLA student Bunchy Carter would later go on to found the Southern California chapter of the Black Panthers — and its legacy of advocacy projects to combat “the low admissions rates of Afrikan students at UCLA while continuing to advance the rights and overall quality of life for all students.”
It is probably safe to say that the student activists in question did not forget this legacy.
In fact, war-on-free-speech rhetoric often relies on the idea that students these days have no idea what is at stake for themselves — that their activism comes out of nowhere and is not connected to a historic struggle. But the contemporary fight against microaggressions carries the weight of a long history of marginalized student groups trying to improve campus environment for students in the future. This struggle is just as important as — and in fact deeply intertwined with — the protection of civil liberties. After all, there is no point in protecting students’ right to free speech and to freedom of assembly only to hinder any real results of their activism.
Kristen Woodruff is a senior majoring in classics. Her column, “Old School, New Tricks,” runs  every other Wednesday.
I was skeptical as I first began reading, but I tried to keep an open mind.  I then came across the words “power dynamics,” and immediately realized that my early skepticism was entirely justified.  With each successive paragraph, the correctness of that skepticism was only further reinforced.  
The author then closes by using the term “microaggressions,” and concluding that the civil liberties of some students can only be protected by violating the civil liberties of other students.  Because their right to free speech is contingent on the censorship of their classmates.  If people are allowed to disagree, then there exists the possibility of agendas being frustrated, and we certainly can’t have that.
Perhaps we can start calling it, “open source speech”
There is lots of rhetoric here, but the argument boils down this: “Bad speech isn’t free speech.”  The response is obvious–who gets to decide what’s bad speech?  You and everyone who agrees with you, presumably?
I, and many others, find the views held by most professors and students at California universitites to be naive, short-sighted, and disgustingly self-indulgent.  It’d be awfully nice to shut that crowd up with some carefully designed laws.  But, that’s not an option as long as we have the First Amendment.  And neither is it an option for UCLA administrators to shut down a frat for engaging in crude humor at the (well-deserved) expense of a couple celebrities.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to my scrumptious soulmate: the avocado. Yes, avocados are very much part of the green health craze that I previously discussed, but they also hold a place near and dear to my heart. Not only are they powerhouses packed full of 20 nutrients, including potassium and Vitamin B, but they are also low in sugar, full of fiber and are filled with monounsaturated fat, a “good” fat that helps lower cholesterol levels, decreases your risk of heart disease as well as improve brain activity.
According to the Huffington Post, a single avocado contains 975 milligrams of potassium, which is crazy because a banana, well-known for being exceptionally loaded with potassium, has about half that, with 487 milligrams per large fruit.
That being said, avocados are also one of the most versatile food options out there –– they can be combined, blended, sliced, smeared or enjoyed au naturel. Check out a few of my favorite college dishes that showcase this green gift sent from above.
This is quite easily one of the simplest creations out there, but also one of the tastiest combinations ever to be made. You simply take toast and smear on avocado like you would a spread. I like adding some chili flakes on top and a little squeeze of lemon. Balsamic vinaigrette and tomatoes also pair very nicely.  
This dish only requires an egg, avocado and an oven. With a spoon, carve out a hole in the middle of two avocado halves. Lay the halves on a baking dish and carefully crack one egg into each slice. Bake this in an oven for 15 minutes or more depending on how cooked you enjoy your eggs. When it’s ready you can add salt and pepper. Also, if you’re a fan of poached eggs, you can easily poach one and then add it to the cut center of an avocado.
Avocados can be easily paired with any type of fruit for a rich taste of sweetness and creamy satisfaction. Though it sounds counterintuitive, I like mixing avocados with watermelon and feta cheese. It is a simple mix that can be prepared quickly if you have the ingredients. I also love eating avocado salads with figs and kale, which pair really nicely with the taste of avocado. Below are two recipes that have my stamp of approval.

Because it’s packed with healthy fats, avocado has a creamy texture that accentuated when mixed with ice and fruit into a smoothie. It makes the consistency yogurt-like, but incorporates added nutritional benefits. I like adding blueberry, raspberry, strawberry and mango to mine. Even if you throw some kale in there, the flavor will be masked by the smoothness of the avocado and the berries. Sprinkle a few chia seeds on top for some added love.
Blend avocados in a blender with chickpeas, olive oil and a bit of tahini. You’ll have an incredible, easy-to-make spread, perfect for crackers or carrots. As we all know, an avocado a day keeps the bad cholesterol away!

At USC and around L.A., students rely on Uber instead of public transportation, something that would rarely happen in Madrid.
As an exchange student coming from Europe, I expected my life to be quite different here in the United States. That is what I came for, to experience new things, to a great extent. However, I am discovering that there are some differences between my life here, and my life in Europe that I would have never anticipated. In this post, I will explain a few things that, some  insignificant, that make my life different than how it is in Spain.
Hello!
If we want to be polite, greeting someone is the first thing to do. But how should I greet this cool friend I just met? There a few differences between how people greet each other in the U.S. compared to Spain. Here, I am afraid you can only shake his hand. If you are close friends, you may have some kind high-five or fist bump. If she is a girl, you can give her a little hug. But what about kisses? In Spain, men shake hands, but if you are meeting a woman, you will usually give her two kisses, one on each cheek. Honestly, I am not a very effusive person, but I think that giving a couple of kisses does not require much effort. Every time I see a boy and a girl meeting on campus, it looks like there is some affection repressed in that half hug. Come on, you are not meeting the First Lady.
Where do you want to go?
“Whatever, just ask for an Uber,” USC students say. Traveling long distances within the city is a Los Angeles-specific issue. In a huge, hectic city like Los Angeles it is shocking that there is no efficient public transportation system. A car will be your first choice for transportation most of the time. I miss walking around cities in Spain. We also take a car or public transportation sometimes, but you are still able to go from one place to another by simply wandering, even in big cities like Madrid. Nevertheless, it is still admirable how well Uber, Lyft and similar apps work. We have not even been able to make them legal in Spain.
The Rule of Apple
Seriously, is Apple giving out devices somewhere on campus? I still cannot believe how overwhelming their control of the market is, at least among young people in L.A. Having neither an iPhone nor Mac  I feel like a being from another planet rather than from another country. Do not panic, we also have Apple in Europe, but people use other brands as well. There is more technological diversity. Here it is just a wide ocean of iPhones, iPads and Macbooks. A few weeks ago one of my professors asked in class if there was anybody who did not own an Apple device. OK, I confess I did not dare to raise my hand. It was far too intimidating.
Free refills
This is truly one of the greatest inventions you have made. No joke, I love it. Fast food restaurants are starting to offer free refills in Spain, but it is not very widespread yet. I know it is not that big of a deal, but being able to stand up after finishing your food to get another drink gives a weird sense of satisfaction. As a business student, I should know that a refill is anything but free, however it lets you feel like you have the power. It also helps me to understand a little bit more about why people in the U.S. are drinking all day. Whether it contains coffee, tea or water, almost every student brings some type of reusable bottle around campus — and not any bottle — the more sophisticated, the better. I guess I will have to get rid of my simple plastic bottle soon.
Overall, it turns out that moving to the U.S. involved more adaptation than speaking another language. That means more chances for me to learn, so I am happy with that. However, I’m not saying I will buy an iPhone.
