In the wake of the killings of two graduate students in April, the Department of Public Safety will increase its presence on campus and emphasize student awareness.

Viterbi School of Engineering students Ying Wu and Ming Qu, both 23 years old and from China, were found shot dead in a car on Raymond Avenue near the intersection of 27th Street.
Thirty Los Angeles Police Department officers have been added to the University Park area in collaboration with DPS. The number of officers on foot, biking and in plainclothes surveillance details will also increase, according to DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas.
“[USC] has undertaken an aggressive education campaign to inform students of the risks of leaving property unattended, dorm rooms unlocked, property exposed within vehicles, walking alone at night and over-consuming alcoholic beverages,” DPS Captain Steve Alegre said.
Though many see the additional police presence as a big step for safety, Alegre said student awareness of personal safety is currently the most important factor. DPS has always urged students to be aware of their surroundings, but the school has enacted further measures in light of the April murders.
According to Sgt. Jamie Bennett of the LAPD, one of the biggest improvements students will notice in the fall is the presence of officers on campus.
“LAPD is going to be on campus; we are there to make you safer,” Bennett said. “My hope is that it is a deterrent to criminals to have us on campus.”
Campus Cruiser has also increased the number of drivers for the fall semester.
According to DPS Captain David Carlisle, the additional police presence and safety awareness project is part of a continuing campaign to help the university become the safest campus in America.
“While eliminating all crime may be unrealistic, it will continue to be our primary goal,” Carlisle said. “Until we accomplish our goal, we will not be satisfied.”
DPS sees student awareness as the first step toward reaching this goal.
“It is always important to remember that often the key to safety … is smart decision-making by the students,” Thomas said. “Public safety is a partnership, and students can help DPS by making smart decisions that won’t increase their likelihood of becoming the victim of a crime.”
The recent crimes near campus have shocked some students into paying more attention to their surroundings.
“I never really understood how dangerous the surrounding areas of campus were until the tragic deaths of two USC students,” said Christine Doh, a senior majoring in visual anthropology. “It definitely made me more aware of my surroundings.”
Other students who already see and feel the presence of DPS on and off campus said increased DPS and police presence would be a welcome addition.
“I’ve never felt uneasy on or immediately off of campus. It feels like every couple of seconds a DPS officer is passing in a car or chariot, and for that they definitely deserve to be recognized,” said Matt Cook, a senior majoring in kinesiology. “Even in the wee hours of the morning, the yellow coats are posted up at every corner guiding me home.”
What’s the point of putting more patrols on-campus when the shooting you keep referencing took place over a mile off-campus? Most of the violent crime ‘SC is victim to occurs off-campus in the 2 miles surrounding. Now all the criminals know to stay off campus & focus on the surrounding area, where it will take the PD a good 5 mins to get off campus & on-scene. Brilliant!
An article in the LA times shortly after the killings in April stated that USC is picking up the bill for the extra officers that are being shifted in.
well, considering it’s the local residents’ fault we need the extra patrols, they should definitely be the ones paying for them.
So who is paying for this extra patrolling by LAPD? I hope the local resident/tax payers aren’t getting stuck with this bill.

Religious Trojan football fans might remember the setbacks fullback Ryan Powdrell experienced following his broken ankle in ‘06, an injury that took him out for the remainder of the season.
Powdrell went on to play again in the NFL, but many athletes aren’t as fortunate. Often times, an injury as pedestrian as Powdrell’s broken bone can be enough to endanger an athlete’s promising career.
Debilitating injuries occasionally sustained by student-athletes not only break their spirits and bones, but can also break their banks: post-injury, many powerhouse universities choose to discontinue students’ athletic scholarships, forcing student-athletes and their families to pay full medical expenses and tuition to a school their son or daughter no longer plays for.
In response to these situations, State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima) authored Senate Bill 1525, the “Student-Athlete Bill of Rights,” to ease the financial burden on injured student-athletes at USC and at other California universities.
Padilla’s bill applies to California university athletics programs with annual media revenues greater than $10 million. If it passes the legislature and is signed into law, the bill would mandate that athletic programs provide equivalent academic scholarships to injured student-athletes, as well as subsidies for their medical care.
“Neither personal injury nor poverty should dim the dreams of a student-athlete pursuing a college degree,” Padilla said. “I am a legislator in California. and I have a duty to protect all Californians — including student athletes in our colleges and universities.”
This bill, if made a reality, would impact USC, as well as Stanford University, UC Berkeley and UCLA’s athletic programs, and force the schools to fund programs solely through their media revenue. The USC athletic department did not respond to requests for comment, but the Sacramento Bee reported that the university only recently withdrew opposition to the bill.
Some in the USC community wonder how this bill could alter the future of Trojan athletics. Many, like Jordyn Holman, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, believe that the bill would be a much-needed expenditure for California collegiate athletics programs.
“It is a university’s responsibility to take care of their students. Schools bring athletes to their programs not only to win games but also to get an education,” Holman said. “This mandate would add an extra level of security for athletes and would alleviate the stigma of being washed-out.”
As an exciting USC football season approaches, and just after more than 35 Trojan athletes competed for Olympic gold at the 2012 London Olympic Games, students like freshman biological sciences major Kaitlin McGillivray remain hopeful about the fate of SB 1525.
An avid follower of Trojan athletics, McGillivray sees the bill as a way to further connect USC’s top-notch academic and athletic reputations.
“Athletics at USC are something to be proud of,” McGillivray said. “The sheer number of Trojan fans across the world speaks volumes of the caliber of the athletics department.”

The Dharma Civilization Foundation established the first chair of Hindu Studies in the United States at USC in June. The $3.24 million gift to the School of Religion created the Swami Vivekananda Visiting Faculty in Hindu Studies and the Dharma Civilization Foundation Chair in Hindu Studies.
The school expects to name a chair by January 2013.
The Dharma Civilization Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on the study of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, chose USC because of its high population of Indian students, as well as its increasing reputation as an elite university, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said.
“As one of the preeminent universities in the Pacific Rim, we aspire to develop institutional strengths in the study of Asian religions, and this chair is a major step towards fulfilling that goal,” Soni said.
Duncan Williams, who serves as the chair of the School of Religion, said the creation of a new chair displays the school’s desire to include religions from all parts of the world.
“We are looking at things in a global way by creating a religious studies program that isn’t biased toward one part of the world,” Williams said. “We aim for a multi-faith and global religious studies program that takes advantage of our place and moment as we position ourselves to be the intellectual hub for the Asia-Pacific century.”
The new position might also serve as a national model for universities working toward narrowing in on the study of a specific religion, Soni said.
“American universities are increasingly engaging with ethnic and religious communities in order to develop scholarly programs focused on particular regions and religions,” Soni said. “This new chair provides a national model for how universities and communities can work together to fulfill their shared goals of research, policy and advocacy.”
Director of Hindu Student Life Bharathwaj Nandakumar said he expects the addition to enhance spiritual life on campus.
“Since a lot of the Indian population at USC are Hindus, this chair will be a wonderful spiritual guide for the students here,” Nandakumar said.
Soni said the chair should benefit the studies of all students interested in theology, not only those interested in Hinduism.
“For students interested in studying religion broadly conceived, and Hinduism specifically, this chair will provide invaluable resources in teaching, research, travel and community engagement,” Soni said.
Indian students said being recognized with the chair is an honor that will assist with providing unity, pride and opportunities for growth the community’s growth.
“This chair is a sign of USC’s expanding diversity,” Pavitra Krishnamani, president of the USC Hindu Student Organization, said. “It helps students get a more varied view on the world while inside our gates. We have always had a large population of Hindu students, but I don’t think we have been properly represented in USC’s academia prior to this appointment.”
Robin O’Neal, a 2012 graduate who majored in philosophy and religion, said this chair is important for USC’s diversity.
“USC has a significant international student population, so in creating the Hindu Chair, the university is recognizing and responding to a void in the program,” O’Neal said. “As a school, we seek to accurately portray our community to the outside world while making each tenant of the Trojan Family feel equally valued.”

A new online resource for transgender students facing discrimination and homelessness came from an unlikely source: one USC student’s blog on Tumblr, a popular social media website.
Listings · Anyone can offer housing to transgender people through the website, which was created by a gender studies major. People from as far away as Australia and the United Kingdom have started using the site. – Photo Illustration by Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
Dylan, a junior majoring in gender studies who asked his last name remain anonymous, said the idea for his website, called the Transgender Housing Network, came from browsing Tumblr.
“I noticed that many of the people I followed on Tumblr who identified as transgender needed a place to stay for a night or more, and I thought that it would be fantastic and convenient to have an aggregate of these listings all in one place,” Dylan said.
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said the blog is not only a good resource for transgender students, but also a way for them to network and socialize without the fear of discrimination.
“The website clearly illustrates how LGBTQ people are being discriminated [against] and kicked out of their families,” Vigil said. “Two people might have trouble finding housing and are able to connect with each other to share their experiences on the site.”
Dylan said he hopes to encourage USC students, regardless of their gender identity, to post on Facebook or THN as long as they are willing to host transgender individuals who need a place to stay.
“Any USC student who is willing to host someone should try to educate themselves about transgender issues and be the best ally possible to whoever they are hosting,” Dylan said. “THN is trying to create safe spaces for transgender individuals, especially if they are struggling with homelessness and similar issues.”
The services of THN are exclusively for those who identify as transgender, although anyone is able to offer housing through the Tumblr page.
Despite the praise the site has received, THN faces some struggles. Currently, Dylan is the only one running THN. And with a part-time job, a spot on the Trojan Marching Band and a full course load scheduled for the fall, it is hard for him to dedicate enough time to running the site.
“These issues could be overcome if I had more people involved in the organization, but this is also difficult because I really, truly want to make sure that everyone directly involved with the network is transgender,” Dylan said.
Mellissa Linton, executive director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly and a junior majoring in American studies and ethnicity and English, also said the transgender community is more often neglected than other groups in the LGBTQ spectrum.
“Since trans are most often neglected in the queer movement, the website provides a safe place to build a network and community,” Linton said, “They are often subjected to violence on the streets [without a place to stay].”
Another obstacle is that many LGBT organizations are not equipped, prepared or willing to take necessary steps to make transgender students welcome and safe.
“Although the ‘T’ is included in the LGBT acronym, it is unfortunately often forgotten. My hope for THN is to not only build trans allies and help cisgender people [one who is not transgender] become better allies, but to build something within the trans community that really specifically caters to the needs of trans people,” Dylan said.
In the future, Dylan said he hopes to make THN a non-profit organization.
“This [non-profit status] would allow us to accept donations and thus pay for a number of services, like web hosting and web design, as well as a number of other things,” Dylan said.
What a concept ! What agreat idea !!!!!!!! I hope whom ever is running this program will contact me as i want to perhaps help in the future .
Kappa Sig still has rooms available

To the cheers of students, alumni and administrators, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission voted 8-1 on May 14 to approve a new lease that gives USC control of day-to-day operations for the 89-year-old facility. The agreement, however, still faces several challenges.
Obstacles · A master lease agreement, giving USC operational control of the Coliseum, is pending state approval and is the subject of a lawsuit. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
The master lease the commission and the university agreed to is still pending approval from several state agencies. Under the lease agreement, USC would manage the facility, although the Coliseum Commission would remain the landlord.
Additionally, the Los Angeles Times and the first amendment group Californians Aware filed a lawsuit in July calling for a new vote on the deal. The suit claims that the Coliseum Commission did not comply with state laws requiring it to hold open meetings and release certain public records.
The time frame for approving the lease remains unclear. Kristina Raspe, vice president for real estate development and asset management at USC, gave the conservative estimate that an agreement should be ironed out in about six weeks.
Melissa Figueroa, deputy secretary of communications for the State and Consumer Services Agency, one of the bodies reviewing the lease, said that there is no timeline for a decision and that negotiations are ongoing.
The state must approve a handful of contingencies, including the lease of six parking lots. Raspe said they are also negotiating a 57-year extension of the lease option and a non-disturbance agreement, which would allow the contract to remain in effect if the commission dissolves.
Figueroa said the agency is evaluating the lease by determining if it is in the state’s best interest.
“You have to make sure everything is legal and accounted for and, like I said, in the best interest of all parties, mainly the party that’s looking out for themselves, which is the state,” Figueroa said.
According to Raspe, the other bodies that will review the lease are the Department of General Services and the Sixth District Agricultural Association, the formal name for the California Science Center.
As officials in Sacramento pore over the 93-page master lease, the agreement between the commission and USC faces questions closer to home.
On July 18, the Los Angeles Times and Californians Aware filed a lawsuit against the Coliseum Commission. USC was not named in the lawsuit.
The suit claims that the commission violated California’s Ralph M. Brown Act by negotiating the lease in closed sessions and the Public Records Act by not releasing certain public documents. The Brown Act provides the public with the right to attend local governmental meetings.
“In the face of a strong public interest and in the wake of the recent scandals, the Coliseum Commission restricted public access to information about the deal, conducting nearly all of its discussions about the lease behind closed doors, in violation of the Brown Act,” Nancy Sullivan, the Times’ vice president of communications, said in an email. “In addition, the Commission delayed its responses to the Times’ public records requests, often for months at a time, and refused to release other records in violation of the California Public Records Act.”
Sullivan also said that the Times attempted to remedy the alleged violations before pursuing litigation, but the commission was unwilling to do so.
Don Knabe, Los Angeles County supervisor and Coliseum Commission president, said he believes the negotiation process for the master lease did not violate the law.
“We have three different attorneys looking at us all the time, so we feel very comfortable that the lawsuit has no merit,” Knabe said.
Los Angeles Councilmember Bernard Parks, the only commissioner to vote against approving the master lease, said more could have been done to involve the public in the negotiations with USC.
“The general perception of those on the commission was that it was sufficient public access to rely on the L.A. Times story and the information that was placed on their website,” Parks said. “Admittedly, no one ever looks on their website. And admittedly, most community people couldn’t find the Coliseum Commission office with a map.”
Knabe, however, said the commission included the public during negotiations.
“Clearly there was a public record, public testimony and public options,” Knabe said.
Thomas J. Faughnan, legal counsel for the commission, responded to the lawsuit’s claims in a letter dated July 3. He wrote that the public had an opportunity to comment on the lease at every commission meeting since October 2011.
“Assertions by the L.A. Times not withstanding, the Commission has always intended this process of considering to amend and restate the USC lease to be transparent and public,” Faughnan wrote. “The Commission’s actions demonstrate this intention.”
According to Terry Francke, general counsel for Californians Aware, the lawsuit calls for a new public vote on the lease.
“The idea is to go back to the drawing board, so to speak, let the community know what the discussion was that led up to the first vote, give the community the opportunity to react and comment and then take another vote,” Francke said. “It may well be the exact same outcome. But at least it will be a decision based on disclosed deliberation.”
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Superior Court said a trial setting conference to set a hearing date for the lawsuit is scheduled for Oct. 25.
Raspe said the lawsuit has not affected the university’s negotiations with the state.
I hope to join the lawsuit and force USC to sell beer and wine margaritas again at future home games as a condition of USC taking over the Coliseum

Young voters are less enthusiastic about voting in the 2012 presidential election than they were in the 2008 election, according to a new Gallup poll. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters between the ages of 18 and 29 say they are “definitely likely” to vote, a 20 percentage point decrease from October 2008.
According to Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the large decrease in percentage points might be attributed to the nature of the 2008 election.
“The 2008 election was a very exciting one,” Schnur said. “Young people were just more excited about the 2008 election than any other campaign since 1984 or maybe even 1968. Those elections don’t come around all that often and are dependent on different societal challenges.”
Though the dynamic of this election is different from 2008, Schnur said he still sees students excited about participating in the upcoming presidential election.
“We’ll hold between 20 to 25 events this fall, almost all directed to the presidential election,” Schnur said. “The feedback we’re getting from students is that they want even more.”
Michael Wang, a senior majoring in political science, said discussing hot-button issues, such as gay marriage, immigration and health care, might help get students involved.
“Generally, once kids go back to school, they get more excited about the election while they’re talking about it in class,” Wang said.
Aaron Taxy, a junior majoring in international relations and president of the USC College Democrats, said the struggling economy could also draw the attention of young voters.
“Economically, things are getting better, but at the same time young people are facing an economy recovering from the recession,” Taxy said. “The reality of a hard economy will be an important gateway for students to get involved in our democracy.”
Ultimately, the participation of young voters will be determined by the interaction they have with their peers, experts said.
“The best way to reach a young voter is through another young voter,” Schnur said. “For college students who are interested in the election, they have an additional responsibility to reach out to their colleagues in a way that older people certainly can’t.”
With several months left before the November election, Schnur said youth involvement could increase.
“I know the Gallup poll showed that young voters aren’t particularly excited about this campaign, but the best thing about young people is that they are unpredictable,” Schnur said. “They may surprise us this upcoming election.”

Excitement is high at the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the completion of a new building that will house the Institute for Multimedia Literacy and the Interactive Media Division, in addition to other programs.
A digital building · The School of Cinematic Arts’ new building will be used to house the Institute of Multimedia Literacy and several other departments. It will also feature an interactive gallery of student work. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
According to Douglas Wellman, assistant dean of facilities and operations for SCA, construction on the so-far unnamed building is running ahead of schedule and is expected to be completed in December or January, although the building will not be used until next summer. The design of the building will be similar to the other buildings in the SCA complex.
“The new building will be in the same style as the previous buildings that began construction in 2007,” Wellman said. “It will continue the theme that combines stucco and stone with a Spanish-tile roof.”
IML Director Holly Willis said the new building will provide a wide variety of spaces to accommodate different learning activities and will allow students and faculty to interact across dozens of screens.
“We are very excited about the incredible potential created by the state-of-the-art learning labs,” Willis said.
With the construction of a new facility, the IML, which offers an honors program and a minor, seeks to add a new major in digital media and culture. The IML was founded in 1998 as an educational resource dedicated to changing forms of media and networking.
“We hope it will be approved and available to students in fall 2013,” Willis said. “The new building will become a terrific new site for this new major.”
In addition to an expanded curriculum, some students are looking forward to seeing the IML gain more classroom space on campus.
“The thing I’m looking forward to most about the new building is just having our own space, as many of our classrooms are becoming pretty cramped,” said Chris Swiatek, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment. “The construction of the new building is vital, I think, in the growth and expansion of the interactive program.”
In addition to the IML, the new building will serve as a home for SCA’s IMD and the department’s Game Innovation Lab, both of which are currently located at the Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts on Figueroa Street. Tracy Fullerton, the Game Innovation Lab’s director, said moving into the same building as the IML will have benefits for both programs.
“Having our game design faculty and students working right next to our researchers in creative media … will mean that that work will cross-pollinate and influence each other in new and innovative ways,” Fullerton said. “Because we’re now part of the Cinematic Arts Complex, we are going to be even more integrated into that community.”
The building will also include laboratories, research spaces, offices, classrooms, a seminar room with floor-to-ceiling projection ability and an interactive gallery in the lobby. Fullerton said the showcase space will feature gestural tracking and touch screens as a way for students to display their projects in a public setting.
“The building itself will be ‘aware,’” Fullerton said. “Sensors are being embedded to track the various systems and visitors will be able to interact with the building via Twitter.”
Scott Gowin, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment, said he is eager to see how students use the resources in the building as gaming becomes more popular.
“I may not have much opportunity to use the new building,” Gowin said, “but I look forward to what the next generation of students will do with the monumental resources that are sure to be provided to them.”
The building will also house the media arts and practices Ph.D. program, online multiplayer game design, interactive architecture, immersive, mobile and environmental media, crowd-sourced cinema, transmedia storytelling, alternate reality games and augmented-reality and mixed-reality experience design.

The patio view from the head coach’s suite at USC’s recently erected John McKay Center overlooks Howard Jones Field, where the football team practices.
State of the art · USC’s new 110,000-square-foot athletic facility, the John McKay Center is equipped with a larger weight room and is more than twice the size of Heritage Hall, which opened its doors in 1971. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Oddly enough, it’s a view that doesn’t get much use — and won’t anytime soon.
“I’m not allowed to use it, really,” said Lane Kiffin, the Trojans’ coach. “I’m not allowed to watch anything from it because of compliance.”
That second-floor patio on the west end might be the only part of USC’s new $70 million, 110,000-square-foot athletic facility that isn’t getting used around the clock these days. The McKay Center, which officially opened earlier this month after its soft opening on July 23, already houses all 21 varsity sports. The massive facility stands more than twice the size of Heritage Hall, the previous athletic complex opened in 1971.
“I think there’s a wow factor for sure when people enter the building, just because it’s so dramatically different from what they’re used to,” said Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson, who played a key role in overseeing the project.
The McKay Center, which broke ground in January 2011, has been a long time coming for the athletic department. The last similar on-campus athletic facility to be built at USC was Heritage Hall, which opened more than four decades ago. And the idea for the McKay Center originated as far back as 2002, but was delayed in large part because of construction to the 255,000-square-foot 10,258-seat Galen Center, according to Jackson.
“It’s something that’s been long overdue,” Jackson said. “So from an efficiency and functionality standpoint, it just makes everyone’s job much easier.”
The McKay Center features three levels: a 60,000-square-foot, underground basement that includes training and weight rooms, a football locker room and a 40-yard AstroTurf practice field. The weight room stands eight times the size of the previous one. The ground level consists entirely of academic support programs and the second floor boasts a number of football offices, team meeting rooms and a players’ lounge.
“It’s really great for our players to have all their academics right there, the training room, everything,” Kiffin said. “It’s very convenient for us coaches too. I can’t imagine there’s a better one.”
As evidenced by the project, USC has made great strides to keep up with its Pac-12 counterparts, as a number of universities have made similar efforts to upgrade their football and athletic facilities over the last couple years.
“You always have to stay competitive with your competition,” Jackson said. “But for us, a lot of it was done out of need. The functionality of that space [in Heritage Hall] doesn’t lend itself at all to having a top-tier program.”
Elsewhere out west, schools have spent more than half a billion dollars on athletic facilities. The University of Arizona is in the middle of a $378 million expansion project near the north end zone at its on-campus stadium, which will add approximately 7,000 seats. UC Berkeley’s renovated Memorial Stadium, a project with an estimated price tag of $321 million, will open next month for its Sept. 1 opener against University of Nevada, Reno. University of Utah is building a $30-million football complex and The University of Washington’s Husky Stadium is in the middle of $250 million renovation project, as well.
Suffice it to say, most are eager to usher in a new era.
“Beyond normal maintenance needs that prompt renovations, many of the facilities have been long overdue for upgrading to reflect the changing landscape of collegiate athletics,” said Courtney Brunious, assistant director of USC’s Sports Business Institute. “From upgrading locker rooms to adding luxury boxes to satisfy corporate demand and bring in additional revenue, these stadium renovations help create additional interest in the brand, attract athletes and create additional revenue streams.”
These efforts have been aided, in part, by the Pac-12’s new 12-year, $2.7 billion television contract announced in May 2011 that will divide revenue among member institutions. The deal, which takes effect this season, has tripled the conference’s media rights fees.
“The increase in athletic department revenues each school receives from the deal has undoubtedly aided in funding projects that may have been languishing a bit,” Brunious added. “Any increase in revenue is going to help athletic departments in a number of areas, including renovations.”
Foremost for USC, though, the renovations have been directed toward meeting the needs of its athletes, as opposed to simply satisfying corporate demands. And the players, unsurprisingly, have been receptive to the change.
“Man, it’s amazing,” sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey said. “That’s what we’ve been missing out on. It’s light-years ahead of Heritage.”
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the McKay Center was 110 square feet. It is 110,000 square feet. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

In an effort to improve the atmosphere and menu options for on-campus dining, USC Hospitality completed substantial renovations to EVK Restaurant and Grill, Café 84 and Trojan Grounds this summer.
Fine dining · After renovations, EVK Restaurant and Grill includes a salad bar that boasts fresh and local options. Trojan Grounds was converted into a licensed Starbucks and Café 84 became an additional dining hall. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
EVK and Café 84 are scheduled to open Wednesday and Trojan Grounds, now a licensed Starbucks, opened Monday with limited hours. It will begin operating 24/7 next week.
For returning students, the upgrades will seem stark, Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger said last week as contractors laid the final touches on the new Café 84, which will now serve as a third dining hall. Klinger said USC Hospitality used Whole Foods as a model for its Café 84 renovations.
“The sophomores, juniors and seniors are going to go in and be blown away,” Klinger said.
EVK’s facelift left the dining hall with coffered ceilings, wooden floors and modern lighting fixtures. EVK also includes a pizza oven and a Mongolian grill, which executive chef Eric Ernest said can heat up to about 900 degrees.
“For that swipe, you can come in and you really get an experience like a Las Vegas-style buffet, where everything is small and unique and craveable,” Ernest said.
In addition to physical upgrades to the facilities, USC Hospitality has also made adjustments to its menus. Ernest said he hopes to emphasize the use of fresh and local ingredients.
“When food is fresh, it’s beyond taste,” Ernest said. “It’s just a much better experience.”
USC Hospitality reorganized several chef positions to create this experience, a change that Klinger said might result in increased operating costs.
“We’ve added some staff, so we’ve incurred some additional costs in regards to the staffing,” Klinger said. “And also for the food because of the way that we are doing it, the way that we are producing it — the smaller batches and we’ve upgraded the menus. We are anticipating an increase in cost there as well.”
Though the cost of producing meals will increase, Ernest said the cost of ingredients should remain about the same.
As a licensed Starbucks, Trojan Grounds, which will still offer its convenient store items, was renovated to feel more like a coffee shop. The store will continue to take USCard in addition to cash and credit cards.
Café 84 will feature a crepe station twice a week, a hand-scooped ice cream station and a salad bar inspired by the South Beach Diet, Ernest said.
Klinger said that Thierry Bourroux, associate director of residential operations, will also take feedback from students and student organizations into consideration.
“As he gets feedback, we’ll make adjustments or changes either to the menuing or the programming or the hours,” Klinger said.
Klinger said, however, that changes sometimes have to be tradeoffs, using hours as a hypothetical example.
“If you [students] want later hours, then maybe we’ll open up later or we’ll have to look at a different option,” Klinger said.
Both Klinger and Ernest said they believe the changes will make a significant difference in the residential dining experience.
“We spent a little bit of effort on it, you know, as opposed to just a little lipstick here and there,” Klinger said jokingly.

As USC continues to advance its Specific Plan for development of the University Park community, it remains unclear how the university will change its relationship with the neighborhood.
Redevelopment · The University Village is a popular location for members of the USC community and the surrounding neighborhood. Questions remain about its future as USC plans to begin big renovations of the space. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
With nicknames like “University of Spoiled Children” and the “University of South Central,” USC has long had the reputation of a ritzy college in the middle of a not-so-nice neighborhood.
And those stereotypes even have statistics to back them up. According to the Los Angeles Times, 53 violent crimes have occurred in the University Park area since January, and a median household income of $18,533 is low for both the city and county of Los Angeles.
Perhaps because of these statistics, university officials have planned the redevelopment of the University Village shopping center as one of the largest components of the USC Specific Plan.
The proposed redevelopment of the center will create more than 2 million square feet of new student-faculty housing as well as add more retail outlets and restaurants, according to David Galaviz, executive director for local government relations at USC. The university wants the project to benefit the community as well as students and has held more than 250 public meetings since the start of the project to encourage residents of the area to get involved.
The response from the community has shown that USC’s efforts are working. As evidence, Galaviz pointed to a public hearing held by the city planning department in March that drew a crowd of 800.
“One of the challenges is that people think the university doesn’t have strong relationships with the community, but if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able to get 800 people to a hearing,” Galaviz said.
The project will also create an estimated 12,000 jobs, but the community involvement it will bring could be more important.
“The university feels that by redeveloping the new Village, we can enhance the strong ties that already exist,” Galaviz said. “We can create a new center where community members and especially students can spend time in one place. That doesn’t exist in the current Village.”
Though the university seems confident about the inclusion of the community, some community members themselves are concerned.
David Robinson, the political director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy — a group that lobbies on behalf of residents and community members — said many families have been pushed out of the neighborhood in recent years by rising rent prices. The group worries that more university development will only aggravate this trend; they want USC to add more affordable housing to its plan.
“Instead of tens of families, we are saying roughly a couple thousand families should be able to stay in the neighborhood based on a combination of affordable housing, small business support and local hiring,” Robinson said. “Their plan right now will not help more than a token representation of the community today.”
Gabriela Garcia, community organizer for SAJE and 12-year resident of the area, said residents also want to ensure the development doesn’t eradicate their neighborhoods and sense of community.
“This development will really define how our neighborhood looks for the next 100 years,” Garcia said. “We want to make sure residents are not pushed out of that process.”
The development of The Village, including the loss of Superior Market and other small businesses, is another concern.
“Some families are feeling that this is not their place anymore. They want to preserve the neighborhood. This is where their babysitter lives or where their favorite bakery is,” Garcia said.
Some students also noted the importance of finding a compromise with the community.
“It is unfortunate that the university’s gain could end up being the greater community’s loss,” said Denise Ge, a junior majoring in international relations global business. “It is the job of students and alumni to encourage the school to include more affordable businesses in The Village.”
Though residents still have major concerns about the project, Robinson said, the community is still hopeful that the university will compromise with them to find a mutually beneficial plan.
“If USC wants to do less local hiring but more affordable housing and more small business support, that’s great. That’s up for negotiation, but right now USC has taken a very oppositional stance,” Robinson said. “What we want is a win-win … a plan that will serve USC, its students [and] its staff, but will also serve the local community.”
Gosh, what a surprise.  As usual, “justice” in a name = “gimme free stuff.”
The gentrification that Mr. Robinson is fighting is inevitable. ‘SC is merely following the model presented by other schools located in urban areas. He needs to ask the city to build more affordable housing in the area. The school probably intends any new housing in the neighborhood for students, faculty, and employees.
This whole project seems more Hipster than Bro

The Coliseum serves not only as the home of Trojan football, but also as a historical symbol of USC and South Los Angeles.
The Coliseum, however, has been standing on shaky ground recently. With the venue on the verge of bankruptcy and Coliseum executives facing charges for corrupt management, the city, county and state have proven unable to sustain the taxpayer-owned stadium as a functional and profitable enterprise.
Zingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
 
The university has amended its pre-existing lease with the Coliseum Commission to assume management control of the Coliseum, turning it into an essentially private enterprise.
On the outside, it appears that the pending deal will only benefit the Coliseum, with the university planning to pour $70 million in renovations toward the complex, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The aging Coliseum will undoubtedly be revamped to live up to the dominance of Trojan football, giving fans more than enough to cheer for.
If the deal passes and USC becomes the new manager of the Coliseum, however, the school has  certain obligations — obligations that its predecessors were unable to fulfill.
One of the university’s most crucial responsibilities is to increase transparency as it undergoes lease alterations and finalizations with the commission. It’s a smart move, as USC cannot follow in the commission’s scandal-plagued footsteps.
According to the Los Angeles Times, a first amendment group called The Californians Aware and the Times are suing the commission for denying public discussions and records over the new lease, struck by the university and the commission behind closed doors, as a violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act.
Public accountability is ultimately the government’s burden, but the university also has a responsibility to ensure community involvement as the new manager of what has been and should continue to be a community stadium as a state and local landmark.
Though greater transparency is only the first step, the university must also prove its commitment to the city by continuing to support public events at the Coliseum. The proposed lease entails that USC must reserve a minimum of eight days a year for public events planned by the commission; thus, the community could very well be cut out of using the stadium as a gathering place for much of the year.
As a university that “draws its unique vigor from [its] surrounding communities,” as stated on its website, USC owes the community and the student body a strong devotion to public development and service.  Only then will the Coliseum be restored to its former glory as a historic venue that proudly stands not only for the Trojan Family, but also for a united Los Angeles community.

The release of the Freeh Report last month capped arguably the biggest scandal in the history of American higher education.
The 267-page document, the result of an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, is laden with details about Pennsylvania State University senior officials’ inaction in the wake of allegations against now-convicted child molester and former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. The report primarily highlights a “total disregard for the safety and welfare” of Sandusky’s victims and a failure by school administrators to follow federal provisions requiring crimes of such nature to be reported.
It will take a while for the sting to subside, but the lingering ordeal can at least provide a cautionary tale for schools nationwide, including USC, as to how a football culture can overwhelm a university.
Among the reasons for Penn State’s inaction was “a culture of reverence for the football program that is ingrained at all levels of the campus community,” Freeh said in his report.
Like Penn State, USC is a school that upholds a storied legacy on the gridiron, one that lends itself to local, national and even international acclaim.
But the Nittany Lions’ program serves as a stark reminder of how deference toward football can go too far, even motivating a university president to cover up allegations of sexual abuse in order to protect the team and its coaches. Football became not just a varsity sport played by student-athletes but a way of life that clouded the judgment of administrators and fans alike.
USC, as well as other schools boasting elite collegiate athletic programs, should always understand the balance between preserving its image and making moral decisions. Trojan football does not define our school. It’s more than just a typical aspect of student life — in fact, it’s an undeniably important part of it — but it also has its limits.
In 2012, this school will compete for college football’s highest honor: a BCS national championship. But as students, faculty and administrators, we must never prioritize the needs of an athletic institution over the well-being of individuals.
As Penn State has shown us, no school is too big to fall.

With an AD like Pat Haden, there isn’t much to worry about…for now.
All the problems started in 2005 when they stopped selling beer at the Coliseum
I once found myself with a unique perspective on a big news item in the local paper.  A man had his dog taken from him by the humane society and the newspaper trumpeted the uncompassionate nature of this act to a man who loved his pet.  However as his landlord I knew a little more about this gentleman than the reporters–that he could  not really take care of himself.  No one, I might add, during the many weeks that this man’s attorney tried to get the dog back did anyone solicit my opinion.  I think the Penn State scandal–the biggest in history?–probably looks a lot different than is portrayed when you subtract motives among other baggage.  How did reasonable people–Joe Paterno, the former president of Penn State–morph into monsters?  There’s been a feeding frenzy over Penn State and  at some point–not right now apparently– calm heads will prevail.

USC’s ascent over the last couple decades, especially since the inauguration of President C.L. Max Nikias in 2010, has been nothing short of impressive.
In response to USC’s rise in the academic rankings, ever-growing endowment and transformation into a global campus, the university has accelerated its transition into a fully residential campus.
One of the steps being taken toward this goal is converting Café 84, formerly a food court for all students, into a new dining hall to serve the freshmen living in Fluor and Webb towers. But converting favorite spots on campus into mostly freshman areas and displacing upperclassmen has not been as welcome among students as USC’s rise in the academic rankings has.
Through the Master Plan, the administration has taken various steps toward building a “safe, attractive, sustainable, residential campus” and to “accommodate … the university’s strategic, academic, and enrollment goals.” The transformation of Café 84 is one of the steps that have been completed for this year’s new freshmen.
Though these new freshmen — and those to come in later years -— deserve the best, this step is inconvenient for many students and does not take into consideration what is being denied to upperclassmen.
Café 84’s switch will go beyond just affecting freshmen. Gone are the days when students could go grab their favorite smoothie at Jamba Juice after a workout at the Lyon Center or get a Wok Bar bowl between classes.
Now, some of the best places for all students to go are being replaced by another dining hall that will only be frequented by freshmen. Do we really need another EVK?
Before this transformation took place, upperclassmen and freshmen alike could easily grab a pasta bowl from Pasta Presto and a smoothie from Jamba Juice for $10 or less. In order for students without a meal plan to get a meal from another dining hall, however, they would have to pay at least $11. Despite the recent improvements made at EVK, most students will be less than thrilled with paying this amount for the average dining hall meal, especially if they are in a hurry and just need to grab food quickly.
Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all type of approach to on-campus dining, USC should ensure that there are plenty of places to go for students with and without meal plans. Not only would more venues that follow the former layout of Café 84 make life easier for students who frequently eat on campus, it would also foster more mixing of the student body as opposed to cordoning freshmen off from the rest of campus.
It is important for the administration to remember the upperclassmen in their future plans instead of developing a freshman experience at the expense of other students. Plans such as the conversion of Café 84 effectively leave these students high and dry.
With the goal of being regarded as a world-class elite institution, the administration is working to  advance some measures that do not take into consideration the interests of all students equally. Though new food options for all students will move into the area via the Master Plan, they are not here yet. During this transition phase, upperclassmen must be remembered.
The changes will be good for USC freshmen, but that does not mean that all aspects of the plan will be good for students. The change at Café 84 is a case in point. Ensuring an exceptional student experience for all students at every stage in their academic careers, not just when they are freshmen, must always be a priority.

@mg, Oh you are mistaken my bro hater friend
We have not moved an inch in the rankings since Nakias took over. Up ’til now, it’s been all Sample.
What are you talking about?  Number one preseason in the AP!  Thank you Max!

USC is bursting with the creative, the witty and the prolific — but you would never know that from our student publications.
For a top university as populous and diverse as USC, we have a shocking lack of student publications, particularly those that appeal to the tastes of students. Our two major journalistic outlets, the Daily Trojan and Neon Tommy, have each had enormous success in their own ways but ultimately are variations on the same theme.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
That theme is news, entertainment, opinion and sports diluted into 500-800 word pieces and delivered in typical, PG journalistic style.
The Daily Trojan, in particular, prides itself on adhering to the same traditions it started with when the first edition was published in 1912, observing strict rules about formatting and article length and adhering to the “journalist’s bible,” the Associated Press Stylebook.
These characteristics are not necessarily flaws. However, as these publications continue to go without healthy counterparts, they threaten to become cumbersome.
We are college students of the Internet generation. The web’s influence on virtually every aspect of our lives includes how we consume media.
With young people leading the charge, more and more Americans now turn to the Internet as their primary news source.
Recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that 54 percent of Americans get their news through a laptop or desktop computer. Nearly a quarter of American adults also now regularly get their news from at least two digital devices, such as a laptop and a smart phone.
And the more we’re online, the more we become accustomed to a vast array of journalistic forms and styles.
We don’t just like the Internet — we like short and spicy tweets, links to YouTube videos and sarcastic blog posts with lots of pictures. We love all kinds of traditional journalism fouls: colloquial language, hyperbole and rapid changes of subject.
The University of Michigan, for example, runs a student publication modeled after The Onion, called The Michigan Every Three Weekly.
Publications that bear this in mind do crop up from time to time at USC, but they are rarely student publications in the true sense of the word.
Student groups put together newsletters, but they are inconsistently published and only really distributed within those groups. The Master of Professional Writing Program publishes the Southern California Review, an acclaimed literary magazine, but its submissions and readership come mostly from outside the university.
What we need is a publication that appeals to unique, contemporary tastes but that remains consistent, reliable and available to the entire USC student body.
That isn’t to say we don’t want our traditional publications. There’s a whole lot of junk getting published today and a clean, clear, professional news article can be refreshing as well as extremely informative.
But if these kinds of sources continue to be our only option, the student body is bound to get antsy.
The student body would benefit from other publications — from university-oriented literary journals to satire magazines to more blogs like “Overheard at USC,” which documents the hilarity of what students say when they think no one is listening.
Give us a place to publish student art, microwavable recipes and harangues with lots of swearing. That’s the healthy balance USC campus publications need.
 
Francesca Bessey is a sophomore majoring in narrative studies and international relations.
 
I think this article makes a great point; however, it seems like one of your major points is that USC publications need to go more digital and become more accessible. Just want to put it out there that Neon Tommy is an ONLINE publication that covers news that go way beyond the campus. We report and cover events live beyond normal student work hours. 
Running a student publication and being successful is a very difficult task. It requires a lot more effort than you think. But nevertheless, excellent points. I’d love to see a greater variety as well

The undertone of almost every groundbreaking, dedication and recognition at USC suggests that it is becoming the Ivy League of the West.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
USC has long worked to become one of the most esteemed universities on the West Coast. Students from all over the world come to USC seeking a world-class education at an institution rich in history and diversity — the cornerstones of any Ivy League education.
These students are also all too familiar with the faults of Ivy League universities: pretentiousness, legacy preference and cultural voids.
Therefore, USC steering toward becoming the Ivy League of the West is the wrong move. USC should strive to create a new class of elite universities that value the importance of research, cultural diversity, community outreach and innovation.
Many Ivy League universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, located in one of the poorest sections of Philadelphia, have been criticized for taking over the surrounding community.
USC, though, maintains close relations with the surrounding area and recognizes the legacies embedded in the Trojan Family — but — does not equate them with entitlement, instead integrating the cultural diversity of its students and community into the framework of the university.
By focusing on the community, USC has also been able to propel itself forward as a leading research institution. Through initiatives such as the Rossier School of Education’s Hybrid High School and the advancement of the Keck Hospital of USC, the university has influenced research spheres and made a lasting impact on Los Angeles.
Another integral component of becoming its own kind of world-class university is the ability to effectively raise money and have a continuously growing endowment.
As far as fundraising goes, USC already has its sights set higher than the Ivy Leagues. Last year, President C. L. Max Nikias launched the most ambitious fundraising goal in the history of higher education — attempting to raise $6 billion in seven years. This would nearly double USC’s current endowment of $3.7 billion. A larger endowment will provide USC with the financial mobility to become a leader in higher education, rather than a follower. It will also allow the university to better weather financial turmoil and fundraising droughts.
Nikias announced the university’s fundraising goals after raising more than $1 billion in his first year as president, despite stagnant national fundraising numbers from peer institutions reported by the Council for Aid to Education. And universities do not launch record-setting fundraising campaigns without first ensuring that they can meet or exceed their initial goals. The Campaign for the University of Southern California not only reflects USC’s commitment to the endowment of the university, but also to the integrity and strength of the Trojan Family.
USC should use the foundations of Ivy League universities, such as highly esteemed faculty, research opportunities and financial resources, to establish its own class of universities that caters to the demands of the 21st century.
Though USC’s rise in the US News & World Report’s college rankings might be stagnant over the next few years, an emphasis on innovation and preparedness for the future should allow USC to forge a new definition of higher education.
 
David Lowenstein is a junior majoring in international relations global business.
Columbia raised $5 billion in 5 years
UC Berkely in approx 7 years
Cornell has not finished rasing their 4 to 5 billion
Stanford raised $6B in approx 6 years
USC did raise 1 billion in 1 year, 2010-2011.
The way you phrased it, it reads as if those other universities raised all those funds in 2011, which is inncorrect.
USC has been in the top 5-10 fund rasinging universities for decades.
I agree that USC should be striving to a higher standard rather than copy the identity of another. However, the statement that USC should create “a new class of elite universities that value the importance of research, cultural diversity, community outreach and innovation” does not differentiate it from Ivies. What was listed there defines Ivies today and explains why their brand is strong.
It’s not quite true that USC raised $1 billion “despite stagnant national fundraising numbers from peer institutions.” 2011 showed that universities raised more than any year in US history (over $30 billion). Peer institutions have done comparably well: Columbia is now in a $5 billion campaign, Cornell in a $4-5 billion one, UC Berkeley in a $3 billion one. Stanford recently raised over $6 billion, and Yale almost $4 billion.

A brand is a perception. The Ivy Leagues, eight Northeastern universities with primarily colonial roots, have leveraged that perception to improve the quality of their students and academics as well as increase their endowments.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Taking a cue from the academic heavyweights, USC should pursue the same brand perception as Ivy League universities in order to gain the accompanying prestige and benefits.
Indeed, changes in the university’s academic selectivity and output over the last few decades have already launched USC toward a more Ivy-like reputation. Most notable has been USC’s rise in national college rankings, a change that is essential in transforming any university.
Though every university in the world is unique, the perception of a university and its admissions are intimately linked to its ranking. A 2009 University of Michigan study on the effect of college rankings found that higher rankings have a substantial impact on improving admissions indicators. For example, the study found that moving into the top 50 results in a 3.6 percent decrease in acceptance rate.
USC’s rise in national and world university rankings grants a certain prestige that the Ivies hold in our culture. At least in rankings, being more like an Ivy has tangible benefits for improving the caliber of applicants.
USC can also become more Ivy-like by increasing its endowment, a task already underway. Though the use of the $6 billion the university aims to raise through the Campaign for USC hasn’t formally been allocated, it stands to reason that much of it will be used to increase the endowment of the university. Harvard, Princeton and Yale have endowments between $15 and $30 billion.
Currently, USC’s endowment is about $3.5 billion. Should the full amount of the campaign be added to this, the university’s endowment would be the fourth-largest of any university. Amassing such a large wealth gives USC a huge competitive advantage beyond funding research and acquiring faculty. It would also allow the university to add more scholarships and decrease the number of student loans.
Another critical piece of the Ivy puzzle is presence in the international community.
USC already has a long-standing history of serving international students, but has recently worked to enhance it. There are twice as many incoming international freshmen now than there were a decade ago. Greater geographic diversity — both nationally and internationally — means a wider range of cultures and experiences represented on campus.
Though  USC can’t become older any faster than other universities, using time-tested systems and methods from other universities will further USC’s national and international image as an Ivy-like university. By continuing to develop the USC brand, higher quality students will come and their contributions and achievements will further improve the value of a USC degree.
 
Rachel Bracker is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.
I disagree with the goal articulated in this article. We should not be focusing on becoming more “Ivy-like” in brand, but on creating an identity that is superior in and of itself. I do not believe that Ivies have leveraged brand to improve quality. Rather, it’s the other way around: their high-quality has led to a powerful brand. That is how USC can, should, and will improve its brand.
Small nit: if the entire campaign total went to the endowment, it would be the fifth largest of any university (after Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford). That makes little sense anyway, since by 2018 when the campaign finishes, all the endowments that are currently $5-9 billion will be drastically larger. For example, with 15% annual returns (last year, universities averaged about 20%), an $8 billion endowment today will be over $20 billion in 2018.
Nikias has explicitly said that the goal is for half ($3 billion) of the campaign to be added to the endowment. That would put the endowment (assuming 15% annual growth) at $12+ billion at the end of the campaign. That seems like a lot now, but all the universities that have at least $5 billion now will have over $13 billion in 2018 under normal growth (inflation matters, too). Don’t forget to take into account that they will be fundraising too. Cornell and Columbia are in huge multi-billion dollar campaigns now, and Harvard is rumored to be in the quiet phase of a campaign that will exceed $6 billion. Basically, even with the campaign, we would be fortunate to exceed competitors’ growth by 2-3 percentage points per year, so it will take far longer to beat them in endowment, on the order of decades.
“Should the full amount of the campaign be added to this, the university’s endowment would be the fourth-largest of any university.”
Annual fund raising is generally all expendable. Capital campaigns generally aim to increase the annual giving by 20% to 30% with the hope that that amount is the amount that is endowed. With those rules of thumb, it is likely that , at most, $1.8Bn would be added to permanent endowment.
The stated goal is to add $3 billion to the endowment:

This year, perhaps more than others, USC is making moves not just to innovate but also to redefine its roles.
Depending on whom you ask, USC is any number of things: a football dynasty, a party school, a top-tier research institution. Outside the spotlight, detractors maintain that USC is a vain institution on a pedestal. They claim that perceived safety problems in South Los Angeles forever tarnish the image of USC. They claim USC is a school of die-hard fans who know nothing but football. They claim USC is a school for spoiled children.
But as members of the larger USC community, it’s imperative we recognize and celebrate the university’s tipping point.
The university has established itself as a rising power with a smorgasbord of academic programs and nonpareil perks. It boasts a spider web of connections we call the Trojan Family, myriad resources in one of America’s most vibrant cities and a sports program that not only fosters professional athletes but produces more Olympians and gold medalists than any other university in the United States.
When current university President C. L. Max Nikias took office two years ago, he spoke of the “Destined Reign of Troy.” The university is now poised to begin its reign as the “Ivy League” of the West Coast, bolstered by a student body both passionate and immensely diverse and accented by a football squad that has fearlessly bounced back from inappropriately harsh NCAA sanctions.
See USC’s growth for yourself: The cutting-edge buildings and classrooms springing up across campus, the athletic program working tirelessly for greater glory and a school bringing a college-town feel to historic South Los Angeles.
USC has grasped the opportunity to redefine itself as the best of the West — and this year will no doubt prove to be a definitive moment in the school’s storied legacy.

Well…. both Alex and Ray seem to be two guys with their feet firmly planted on the ground… It all sounds a little egotistical to me… “Ivy League of the West”…. “passionate and immensely diverse”… Who cares??  I graduated from high school and state college back in the 60’s … Made a living… raised a family… invested and saved and retired with several million dollars…All this huff and stuff about a paradigm shift comes off as somewhat arrogant… Go to school … get an education…  go to a football game or two and give it your best shot…. a little humility goes a long ways..
additionally, this article literally didn’t say anything meaningful. The point made was that our football program bouncing back will parallel the institution’s education. While I love SC football, even that is premature hype.
Couldn’t agree more Alex, it is very frustrating.
Or for that matter, stop prematurely anointing ourselves. Ego stroking doesn’t lead to pride. Rather, it leads to ignorance.
Yet it is still impossible to find a TA, or for that matter, a Gen Ed that isn’t a complete joke here…. maybe we stop raising buildings and start focusing on the basics.

Depending on whether your major is in the Viterbi School of Engineering or the School of Dramatic Arts, your answer could either elicit an impressed smile or a disapproving frown from someone asking “So what are you studying?”
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
With news stations reporting on the dismal post-undergraduate unemployment rate and studies by Forbes and TIME encouraging students to pursue fields in mathematics and engineering, it would seem that certain college majors are more lucrative — and perhaps “practical” — than others. A major in fine arts just doesn’t seem to hold the same weight as a major in computer science or civil engineering, and admitting that you’re majoring in philosophy can trigger a blank “and what do you plan to do with that?” expression.
It’s unsurprising, then, that with such a pressure to perform well, those with an interest in the arts and humanities might believe they face a disadvantage when it comes to the job market.
“Unless you go to a top-20 brand-name school, what matters most to employers is your major,” Katie Bardaro, lead economist at the compensation research firm PayScale, told Forbes on May 15.
That Forbes piece goes on to cite a report by Gen-Y research agency Millennial Branding that showed that “a full 69% of managers agreed that relevant coursework is important when considering job candidates.”
But that might not really be the case.
Despite what Forbes and TIME suggest, a student’s choice in major might be irrelevant. As the job market changes to accommodate technological advances, a student’s major holds less importance than his or her ability to perform certain skills that are often acquired outside of the classroom.
“Something that I tell students is that your major is just one piece of the whole marketability puzzle,” said Julie Tieu, a counselor working at the USC Career Center. “When employers are hiring, they are looking at all of your skill sets — not just your major. Your major can be helpful and let you know some of the academics [behind the field] and terminology, but it’s in no way the comprehensive training you’ll need.”
Admittedly, certain majors do have a lower unemployment rate than others, but often by negligible amounts. Recently, the Wall Street Journal used 2010 — a year right in the heart of the job crisis — census data and a study by the Georgetown University Center to compile a list of the most employable and well-paying college majors, but majors in the humanities weren’t far behind their scientific counterparts.
A major in history, for example, had an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent while a degree in biology averaged 5.6 percent. For a student who has a passion for the past, that difference of 0.9 percent might appear insignificant.
In some cases within that same Wall Street Journal study, majors in the humanities had a lower unemployment rate than a science-or-math-related degree. The unemployment rate for a French major, for example, was 5.9 percent, while the rate for computer engineering was 7 percent — an unexpected statistic, but welcome news for the student who just returned from studying abroad in Paris with no idea of where to pick up his or her studies.
But these statistics beg the question: Is that French major really using her degree?
“The major is not the only thing that will determine where your career will go,” Tieu said. “There are so many people who majored in one thing and did something different. And it’s not because they couldn’t find a job [in that field]. It’s because they were able to find a different job that allowed them to use those skills in a different work setting.”
Tieu often tells students who visit her in the counseling center about two of her friends who used their majors in unconventional ways. One of her friends majored in psychology before beginning a career in accounting. Another studied Russian literature before accepting a job as a web developer.
“It always goes back to what you want to do,” Tieu said. “What are your skills? What are your strengths?”
Another thing to consider is the level of happiness that accompanies the field of work you intend to pursue, even if that degree in nuclear engineering flaunts a 75th-percentile salary of $138,000.
Note, for instance, that Forbes listed a career as an author as fourth on its list of the “Ten Happiest Jobs.” Though a degree in English has an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent and a 75th percentile salary of $75,000, this didn’t seem to counteract the happiness bibliophiles and writers experience on the job.
Plus, opting for a versatile major, such as narrative studies or English, can provide opportunities to travel and teach in foreign countries, such as Thailand and Italy, in programs like Fulbright and LanguageCorps. For those interested in a more unconventional career path, taking the time to truly explore undergraduate study through such options might not be such a bad idea.
Still, for sharpening that competitive edge, Tieu considers volunteer experience, internships, participation in student organizations and an ability to communicate well with others as significant ways for students to improve their marketability.
“Employers like to see that you have something else outside of your major anyway,” said Tieu. “If you have a resume and you don’t have anything else on there but your major, then what does that say?”
All things considered, students shouldn’t be afraid to major in what they love even if they might face greater difficulty in finding a job. With new statistics coming in from so many different directions, it’s important to remember that your major doesn’t define you or your net worth.
Only you do.

Over the last six years, the USC women’s soccer team has had a game shown on television exactly six times. Two of those games came during the Women of Troy’s run to a national championship in 2007, and two more came against high-powered UCLA teams.

The last time a USC soccer game was showcased on television was in 2009 — an away game against No. 3 UCLA. Not even the Women of Troy’s 2010 game against UCLA, played at the Coliseum in front of 8,527 fans, managed to crack the airwaves.
But with the Pac-12 Networks’ debut last Wednesday, the Women of Troy will be featured on TV nine times this season alone, each time reaching a larger regional audience than their previous local telecasts did.
For the players, TV exposure is rewarding and exciting. Families can now watch certain road games and players can watch their friends on other teams (and scout them, too) and have the chance to be seen by a broader audience.
And for coaches, the possibilities are endless: recruiting, scouting, building an identity for the program, recruiting again.
“The more visibility you have, the more kids are going to be enticed to come play,”  USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Unfortunately, we don’t have lights here, so it’s hard for people to get out here and see us play. I think the network will allow a lot more people to see us that normally don’t get the opportunity to.”
From the pure excitement the current USC players have when talking about the chance to play on TV regularly, it’s obvious that that opportunity will be a big plus to recruits.
“It has a huge impact [on recruiting],” said junior midfielder Autumn Altimirano. “Having a network that people can watch your games on is pretty awesome — we’re all really looking forward to it.”
Plagued by injuries throughout a disastrous 2011 season in which the Women of Troy suffered the second-most losses in program history, Khosroshahin and the coaching staff went on the recruiting trail like they never had before, bringing in 20 new players, including five transfers. Some of them already felt the pull of the Pac-12 Networks.
“When I was in high school, I never even thought about West Coast schools because I’m from 2,000 miles away,” said sophomore goalie Caroline Stanley, a transfer from Missouri. “So I think it will boost recruiting for sure, especially when they see how we play. It will be a showcase for girls all across the country.”
Stanley perhaps takes thatmentality — that it’s not just the notion of being on TV that is attractive to potential recruits, but the way USC moves the ball fluidly and attacks downfield — from her new coach.
“It’s only going to help us,” Khosroshahin said. “The way we play the game is [an] attractive style, and I think the more people that get to see us play, they’re going to realize what it is we got here.”
And Stanley believes that the newfound exposure will be good not only for USC, but for the sport on a national level as well.
“Women’s soccer doesn’t get a lot of recognition,” Stanley said. “[The] Pac-12 Networks will really showcase our team, along with the other Pac-12 teams. People will see that Pac-12 soccer can compete with the Atlantic Coast Conference.”

After finishing his redshirt senior season at USC, sprinter Bryshon Nellum ventured to the 2012 London Olympics, where he won a silver medal with teammate Josh Mance, a USC junior, as part of the U.S. 4×400-meter relay team. Nellum, who was named the Gatorade National Boys Track and Field Athlete of the Year in 2007, was told he might never be an elite athlete again after he was shot in the legs while leaving a restaurant near USC’s campus in 2008.

Q: In 2010 and 2011, your seasons ended prematurely because bullet fragments shifted in your legs.  Can you talk about the frustrations you felt?
A: It was real tough. I went through a lot of ups and downs, times where I thought I would never be able to reach my peak. But I just stuck with it, stayed in the system and stayed dedicated. I have a great support system at USC and with my family.
Q: What role has your mother played in your recovery process?
A: My mom is also like my sister and my best friend. She’s my everything. There were times where all I could do was go to her. Whenever I couldn’t even stand up to cook, she would be there to make me a nice homemade meal. She was there for me every step of the way.
Q: What are some of your reflections on the 4×400-meter relay race that won the silver medal?
A: Unfortunately, we didn’t get the gold medal, but representing my country and where I came from was really fulfilling. It felt great coming home with a medal. My main goal was to bring some hardware back to show all my hard work paid off.
Q: How has your relationship with teammate Josh Mance evolved over the years?
A: We have a great relationship. We keep each other motivated and competitive. At practice, we challenge each other, so, when it’s time to step on the track, we’re ready. Off the track, he’s a funny dude with a good sense of humor.
Q: As one of the 528 members of the U.S. Olympic team, what were your thoughts on being named the U.S. flag bearer?
A: It was a blessing just to be a part of that ceremony. To carry the flag and represent all of those athletes, I just wanted to do it to the best of my ability. We have a lot of great athletes out there, and to be chosen as the one to carry the flag was an honor.
Q: Do you plan to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro?
A: Definitely, that’s another one of my goals. I’ve finally had a healthy, successful season under my belt. Now, I can just work from here on out.
Q: What is the next step in your career? What are your professional aspirations?
A: My major is real estate development. Right now, I have a couple of more classes I need to finish to graduate. I’m going to knock those out, and then I’m going to start training again for the World Championships. I’ll still be around [USC], but not so much because I’ll be out training and traveling.
Great article. This young man has done a world of good for himself and for his peers. Keep up the good work.

A year ago, the USC women’s soccer team went about as low as it could go, suffering through 13 losses — the most for the program since its 1993 season.
Veteran mainstay · Senior midfielder Samantha Johnson, who scored two goals last season, will welcome 20 new teammates in 2012. – Daily Trojan file photo
But after a slew of injuries in 2011, the Women of Troy are back, looking to rebound and get into the national picture.
At points last season, as the losses mounted, it was difficult to believe that USC won an NCAA championship in 2007, a mere 14 years after the program’s creation.
So coming off an uncharacteristically subpar season at 7-13 overall and 4-7 in the Pac-12, the program needed an infusion of young talent — transfers and freshmen. The initial reviews are promising, as this appears to be not only the most talented incoming class USC coach Ali Khosroshahin has ever recruited, but also a group that has heightened the level of enthusiasm surrounding the program.
USC’s dress rehearsal for the 2012 season came in an exhibition match at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Aug. 11. Out of a roster of 34 players, 20 wore cardinal and gold for the first time. Showcasing their talent as new players, all three of USC’s goals involved freshmen. The final result was a 3-0 shutout over the Mustangs.
“We’re a really young team, but I think that’s going to be one of our strengths,” said senior midfielder Samantha Johnson. “We’re going to have a lot of fresh legs and that’s a big advantage.”
Entering her fourth season on the team, Johnson has played in almost every position on the field with the exception of goalie. Now the veteran, Johnson leads both on and off the field. With the defensive backfield fortified by new recruits, Johnson will return to her more customary role this season as an attacking player.
“I’m making sure that we’re paying attention to the little details,” Johnson said. “Things like making sure that we’re sticking to the game plan and keeping everyone motivated during hard practices or hard times.”
Though the team is adding depth, USC has seven of its 11 goal scorers from 2011, including top-scoring junior forward Elizabeth Eddy. In 2011, Eddy scored four goals, including two game winners.
“So far, we have been working on team play a lot,” Eddy said. “We’re working on defending a lot but also on possession, and on just working well together.”
The team officially kicked off its 2012 campaign last Friday against Cal State Fullerton, notching a come-from-behind victory, 3-2.
“As a group we’re getting more and more acclimated,” Khosroshahin said. “With 20 new players, obviously it’s going to take some time for everyone to get on the same page, but this group has definitely embraced their roles, and they’re working very, very hard. They’re eager to get out there and represent USC.”

The four-time reigning NCAA champion USC men’s water polo team has faced these questions before.
Concerns will surface about avoiding the onset of complacency, replacing lost contributors and surviving the grind of playing in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation to defend its national championship.
Previously given three such opportunities, USC answered all questions and defended its crown, winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive national championship last season.
“[Combating complacency] is a tough thing to do,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “It’s really in the hands of our players. They have to really be willing to do all the work again, and I feel we have done a good job in that area.”
Less than a month away from its opening match at the UCLA Invitational, USC must first determine who will fill the void left by the graduation of superstar goalie Joel Dennerley, winner of the 2011-12 Peter J. Cutino Award as the nation’s top collegiate water polo player, Dennerley is now the starting goalie for the Australian national  team.
The top two candidates to replace Dennerley are redshirt sophomore Ely Bonilla and incoming freshman James Clark. Bonilla appeared in six games last season, allowing nine goals and registering 18 saves. But Clark, Dennerley’s teammate and backup on the Australian national team, is expected to challenge Bonilla for the starting job.
Despite Clark’s impressive international resume, Vavic does not discount the importance of Bonilla’s experience at USC.
“[Bonilla] has played some very good games,” Vavic said. “He’s played excellent [this offseason].”
Whoever wins the job will not bear the burden of replicating Dennerley’s production alone, as the team’s defense is expected to be just as stout even without the luxury of a two-time MPSF Player of the Year in the net.
“[Dennerley] was a huge anchor for our defense,” said junior two-meter Jeremy Davie. “We have to work hard on getting our defense a lot more solid so we can prepare for teams and stop them the way we have the last few years.”
Though the main focus on the defensive side is finding a new goalie, the offensive side retains much of the prolific attacking unit integral to last season’s success. Despite losing last season’s top goal-scorer in driver Peter Kurzeka, USC returns six of its top seven scorers from a year ago.
One of USC’s primary offensive catalysts is All-American junior driver Nikola Vavic, who tallied 41 goals last season, including a team-leading five in the NCAA Tournament.
“This team is confident,” Vavic said. “We just have to continue to work hard, and I think we’ve done a good job of that this summer.”
Though most of the offseason questions revolve around the loss of two star players, the return of another, redshirt senior two-meter Matt Burton, has the team excited. Burton, a team captain, ranked third on the team two years ago with 33 goals scored, earning All-American third-team and NCAA All-Tournament second-team selections. He scored three goals in USC’s first two games last season before being sidelined for the remainder of the year with an elbow injury.
“The recovery is good,” Burton said. “My elbow is fine. It’s nice to be back in the pool because being injured is pretty rough.”
The veteran’s return will provide the young team — only 10 of the 41 players on the roster are upperclassmen — with seasoned leadership.
“[Burton’s return] is a huge plus for our team. He’s a great leader for us,” Vavic said. “He is one of our best defenders and can play the two-meter. Having him for his fifth year is going to be very valuable.”
Of the 10 upperclassmen, four are fifth-year seniors: Burton, drivers Michael Rosenthal and Andrew Reego and two-meter Brian Boswell. The group is hoping to complete a perfect college career with a fifth championship in five years.
“It’s a bit surreal,” Burton said. “If you would have asked me when I came here out of high school if I would have won [even] one championship, I would have been stoked. Going for a fifth ring, that’s perfection. I’ve been more motivated for this one than I have been for the last four.”
With each team in the MPSF ranked in the top nine of the final NCAA national rankings, the road to a fifth title will not be easy.
But given USC’s returning talent and determined mindset, the opportunity is there for the team to continue its historic run.

During the 2011 season, college football fans all over the country learned to appreciate the steady hands and run-after-the-catch ability of then-sophomore receiver Robert Woods and the speed and playmaking ability of then-freshman receiver Marqise Lee.
The duo seemed to be perfect complements to one another.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that they performed well in tandem, though: They have been playing on the same football team and setting records together for years.
Woods, Lee and sophomore receiver George Farmer, a decorated wideout himself, all starred at Serra High School in Gardena, Calif.
“To have three of the top people at the same school is nuts,” Lee said.
Woods is a year older than Lee and Farmer, but in the years they played together, the numbers they put up were staggering. And no one reaped the benefits like their quarterback, Conner Preston, currently a redshirt freshman at SMU.
“Obviously, it made my job a lot easier,” said Preston, a two-year starter for the Cavaliers.
During his senior year at Serra, Woods caught 66 passes for 1,112 yards and 15 touchdowns. He went on to become one of the top receiver prospects in the country and was a five-star recruit. As a senior, the receiver starting across from him was Farmer, who similarly wound up as the top receiver prospect the following season.
“A lot of guys make plays around you,” Woods said. “It’s just very exciting because you see guys making plays, other guys making [people] fall and miss.”
Lee, however, did not develop as quickly on the offensive side of the ball as his counterparts. In fact, he did not start at receiver until his senior season and was recruited by most schools as a safety.
Once he moved to offense, though, he and Farmer created quite the pair: Lee grabbed 57 passes for 1,409 yards and 24 touchdowns while Farmer snagged 65 passes for 1,514 yards and 14 touchdowns. In those two seasons, Preston threw 88 touchdown passes and the team went 29-1.
“Robert was a year above us, and he was like the leader of the pack,” Preston said. “When I came in as a junior quarterback, Robert really helped me with the offense.”
Lee said it is incredible playing with the same receivers at the collegiate level and seeing their success continue.
“At the end of the day, I never expected to actually play with all of them,” Lee said. “Now that I am playing with all of them, I’m appreciative about it, that we all end up at the same place.”
The athleticism of the trio was obvious to Preston during  their days at Serra. He remembered the time Lee wanted to learn how to do a backflip.
Lee saw another player do it and felt the instant urge in pregame to try it, shoulder pads, helmet and all.
“I was like, ‘Dude, please don’t do that. I don’t want you to break your neck,’” Preston said. “‘We got to win this game.’”
Lee went for it anyway, and, by Preston’s account, cleared it by about three feet.
“I knew I was capable of doing [a backflip], but [Farmer and I said], ‘We need to try this. How do you do it?’” Lee said. “And [our other teammate] was like, ‘Just run and hit the backflip.’ So then me and George tried it and hit the backflip.”
Woods, however, was not so lucky in his attempt.
“Robert tried, but he wasn’t quite successful,” Lee said, grinning.
Woods admits that jumping is not his forte. “I’m the only one out of the bunch that can’t dunk,” he said.
Lee was more straightforward in his explanation.
“Robert … [his] jumping ability is not that amazing,” Lee said with a laugh. “He wasn’t a big basketball player.”
Despite being a first team All-American last season, Woods is still the butt of jokes from his then-high school, now-USC teammates.
“[We make fun of him] all the time,” Lee said. “We always have a jumping competition because we know he can’t jump. [We] can’t have catching competitions, because we know he can catch.”
The friendly bond between the receivers and their familiarity with one another helped make the transition for Lee a lot smoother than it could have been.
“Robert being here, a year earlier than [George and I], he provided that leadership and helped us throughout the season to learn what we needed to learn,” Lee said.
Woods’ guidance evidently worked, as Lee was named a freshman All-American and had more than 1,143 yards receiving and 11 touchdowns during his first season on campus. And though Farmer was not a huge contributor in 2011, Woods thinks he certainly has the ability to do so.
“He [has to] be out here in practice, honestly,” Woods said. “His health is his main issue right now. Once he takes care of his health, I feel like he should make the plays.”
The bond of the Serra players is obvious on the USC practice field, but it goes deeper than that: Woods is in constant communication with Preston and other former teammates.
“We still talk. For sure, once or twice a week,” Woods said.
When back home, they meet up and go back to their stomping grounds in Gardena for old times’ sake. And even in the heart of Texas, Preston makes sure to monitor the success of his friends in cardinal and gold.
“When it comes to Saturdays, I’m on the road, you know, getting to my game,” Preston said. “Whenever we’re in the hotel, I just sit down and I’m watching George Farmer, Marqise Lee and Robert Woods on the television … I feel like everywhere I turn, I see a Serra High School player on TV.”
Woods is not a year older than Lee. He is a year ahead of Lee.   Marqise is actually older than Woods.

Oh, the difference a year makes.
A year ago, USC ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press’ preseason college football poll. In USA Today’s poll, the Trojans were absent because of sanctions.
One 10-2 season and one upset of Oregon later, the Trojans now rank in the top three in every preseason poll imaginable, including a No. 1 ranking in the AP poll. With senior quarterback Matt Barkley leading the offense and senior safety T.J. McDonald in charge of the defense, USC is poised to make its first legitimate national championship run since the 2008 season.
Expectations are nothing new to USC squads; heck, the Trojans contended for a national championship every year from 2003 to 2008, starting each season somewhere in the preseason top-10.
Alas, the Trojans haven’t won the BCS trophy since the 2004-2005  season (although the BCS title was taken away) despite lofty expectations since.
Despite Carroll’s stellar 97 wins in his nine-year USC tenure (ignoring the vacated wins), the Trojans appeared in only two national title games. All those other seasons saw USC stumble once or twice and finish on the outside looking in.
In fact, since 2002, only one team has started the season ranked No. 1 and finished there as well: The 2005 Orange Bowl-winning Trojans. Only three teams in the last 26 years have gone wire to wire. College football is an unpredictable sport, and preseason hype hardly guarantees success.
Take 2002: Miami, who had won the title the previous year, headlined the AP Poll. Oklahoma, Florida State, Texas, Tennessee, Florida and Colorado sat near the top as well. At season’s end, Ohio State, who started as No. 13, was the champion and Miami finished second while Oklahoma and Texas finished with two losses apiece. Florida State and Colorado, meanwhile, both went 9-5, finishing No. 21 and 20, respectively.
The Trojans have been let down before in terms of expectations, as well. Barkley’s freshman season saw the Trojans start at No. 4 in 2009 after winning 12 games the year before. They lost four games and stumbled to a No. 22 finish.
College football has a funny way of surprising us year in and year out. Last season it was Baylor, led by quarterback Robert Griffin III, triumphing over Oklahoma for the first time ever en route to a 10-win season. USC also surprised most people last year by winning 10 games and defeating Oregon on the road.
As fans and alumni know, USC is no stranger to the hype machine, but the team doesn’t seem too worried about preseason expectations. Instead, they are more concerned with the present and what they can do themselves.
It is pretty evident from the sign on Howard Jones Field that reads “Locked in” that it doesn’t matter what happens in publications or in preseason polls, or any outside sources for that matter: It is about doing what you can during practice and focusing on each game and each week.
Coach Lane Kiffin isn’t likely concerned with what publications have to say. He is, however, concerned with what happens on the field. His open gripe with the Pac-12 officiating last season after the Stanford game over what he believe cost the Trojans a chance to win in regulation is proof that his main priority is what occurs on Saturdays in the fall, not what happens during the summer.
Though that might mean there are expectations of a national title internally, USC is more concerned with getting better and ignoring what outsiders say. Because, as we know, what analysts and pundits think really doesn’t mean much. The team determines its own success.
So a word of the wise to those expecting instant magic and gratification from the 2012 USC Trojans: You can be excited, but don’t book your flight to Miami for the national championship game quite yet.
As we have seen, the Trojans could finish anywhere on the spectrum. They could be national champions as many expect them to be; they could also finish with two or three losses. Or they could finish ranked in the 20s with four or five losses. No one knows. That is the beauty of college football: Every week has potential for an upset that can turn the BCS on its head.
Preseason polls are just barometers for what we can expect — they are by no means an exact science. It might be “national championship or bust” here in Troy, but there is no reason to believe that “bust” isn’t possible, if not probable, based on history.
A high preseason ranking can easily turn into a four-loss season. Games are won in September and October, not in July and August.

After back-to-back Final Four appearances, the No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team will look to make it three years in a row as it is again poised for a deep postseason run.
“Every year, our expectation is to get back to the Final Four and win,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We’ve been to the Final Four seven times in the [past 11 seasons], which is more than any other team in the country. We want to win a national championship. We know realistically we can’t win every year, but we’re going to try and see how far we can get.”
Though the Women of Troy have produced a decade of excellent on-court performance, it will be 10 years this season since they last held up that NCAA championship trophy. After consecutive national titles in 2003 and 2002, each new season brings lofty expectations.
The 2012 squad heads into the year ranked fifth in the most recent American Volleyball Coaches Association poll, despite losing three All-Americans to graduation.
Among the departed are middle hitter Lauren Williams, Pac-12 Setter of the Year Kendall Bateman and, maybe most importantly, AVCA National Player of the Year outside hitter Alex Jupiter.
Haley will have a difficult time replacing Jupiter, who holds the USC all-time record for career kills (1,918) and points (2,255.5), and Bateman, who was widely considered the heart and soul of the 2011 squad.
Though the losses are great, USC, like any major athletic powerhouse, can recover very quickly; the presence of junior All-American libero Natalie Hagglund and senior outside Katie Fuller will help cushion the blow.
“[Fuller], a senior and one of our captains, is really trying to step it up. She produced a large number of points for us last year and should be a primary candidate for All-American this year,” Haley said. “Hagglund is back, and those two kids are really driving us.”
In addition to the two headliners, the Women of Troy will be bolstered by a veteran supporting cast.
“We have a lot to build around with our junior class,” Haley said. “We have [outside hitter] Sara Shaw, who’s one of the best passers in the country, and [middle blocker] Alexis Olgard, who’s pretty intimidating patrolling the middle.”
Slowed by mononucleosis early last season, Olgard came on strong during USC’s postseason push and impressed during its tournament run. With a full summer under her belt, the rest of the Pac-12 should be very wary  come the regular season.
An infusion of incoming talent should also help supplement the hungry upperclassmen intent on winning it all.  One early camp surprise, according to Haley, has been 17-year-old freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who hails from Guadalajara, Mexico and stands at 6-foot-2.
“We do have a lot of talent,” Haley said. “We’re very physical this year, and I think by the middle of October we can be pretty darn good.”

Perhaps the greatest indication of junior tailback Silas Redd’s whirlwind last month came with the former Penn State star’s minor gaffe when asked about his thoughts entering a BCS title chase with USC. Redd responded that his focus was solely on the Sept. 1 opener against Ohio.
Welcomed addition · Penn State transfer running back Silas Redd ran for more than 1,200 yards last season en route to all-conference honors. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Ohio University Bobcats, however, are Penn State’s — not USC’s — first opponent.
Redd quickly corrected himself later in his first post-practice interview donning a cardinal jersey, expressing his excitement for the Trojans’ first game against Hawai’i.
“My relationship with Penn State was a great experience, and they gave me some wonderful opportunities, but I’m opening a new chapter,” Redd said. “I’m a Trojan now. It was the bigger picture. I made a business decision. Academically, athletically, I felt like this was the best place to be.”
Though he earned 2009 U.S. Army All-American and Walter Camp Connecticut Player of the Year honors, Redd never received a scholarship offer from USC coming out of King Low Heywood Thomas School in Stamford, Conn. Once the NCAA levied its sanctions against Penn State on July 23, however, USC coach Lane Kiffin and his staff relentlessly pursued the 2011 All-Big-Ten second-team selection.
Returning just three scholarship running backs for 2012 in senior Curtis McNeal, redshirt sophomore D.J. Morgan and redshirt freshman Buck Allen, USC identified Redd as a player who could contribute immediately, without the usual adjustment process incoming freshmen must negotiate. But, before seeking to fill an obvious position of need — the three incumbent running backs have combined for a mere 193 carries in their USC careers — Kiffin first sought to determine if Redd’s personality and makeup would suit the tight-knit Trojan team.
“A big part was not just the player that you see on film, but it also had to fit right,” Kiffin said. “He’s a very competitive, great kid, and that’s the only way this was going to work. I believe that our core of great players [is] really good kids that love competition and love to work. If he was not like that, it would not have worked. These guys would not have accepted him.”
Redd, effectively a “free agent,” did not have to sit out a year after transferring to another Football Bowl Subdivision school because of Penn State’s sanctions. Once USC contacted Redd’s high school coach to gather information about the sophomore who ran for 1,241 yards in the rugged Big Ten, in his mind, the decision was simple: Stay at Penn State or head to USC.
“I wasn’t shopping around for other schools,” Redd said. “When they called my high school coach, I told him that [USC] is the only school that intrigues me, so I told him to call them back, and here we are.”
The impact of Redd’s transfer extends beyond his carries on the field; he will also pressure the returning USC running backs to improve their games. The atmosphere of competition Kiffin seeks to cultivate ensures that the players who emerge atop the depth charts are playing to their full potentials.
The primary beneficiary of this approach will likely be McNeal, USC’s returning leading rusher who averaged a robust 6.9 yards per carry but still needs to prove that he can withstand the physical pounding of increased carries.
“We would’ve seen an improved [McNeal] anyway, because [he] has really grown up in his approach to the game and his approach to life,” Kiffin said. “But this just pushes him a little further. We all need competition. And, adding that, I thought [McNeal] looked great [in his first practice].”
With only one year of eligibility remaining, McNeal’s primary focus is his own game.
“I just want to do better than I did last year,” McNeal said. “I want to go out with a bang.”
As for how the current runningback depth chart stacks up, Redd is glad that Kiffin has provided him an honest opportunity to unseat McNeal as the starting running back.
“[The other running backs] are competitors,” Redd said. “We’re coming out here and competing for that No. 1 spot, and I understand that there is no animosity or hard feelings … [Kiffin] told me I was going to get a fair shot, and he’s kept his word.”
Amid the competition, the running backs have also sought to teach and learn from each other.
“We’re just out here competing, making each other better, giving each other tips and just working as a group,” McNeal said.
Much like McNeal, Redd is working to round out his offensive skills and to become a more complete offensive weapon.
“I’m trying to be more versatile,” Redd said. “I came into college as a speedy back, and then last year I tried to take more of a pounding and become a power back. But now I’m trying to balance it, catch the ball out of the backfield and work on my blocking.”
Learning USC’s playbook and jargon will also take some time, but Redd has already received a pro-style offense primer during spring football from new Penn State coach Bill O’Brien, the New England Patriots’ former offensive coordinator who oversaw some of the NFL’s most productive offenses.
“It’s only day one [of fall camp],” Redd said. “I ran the wrong way a couple of times, but I ran the pro-style at Penn State during spring ball, and getting used to the lingo is the hardest thing right now.”
With the media circus yielding and the Penn State disappointment left behind, Redd is now able to prepare for his USC debut and season opener.
“[The most difficult part] was making the decision, figuring out what was best for me, and that decision led me here,” Redd said. “I can honestly say I’m really happy about it. If I had any mixed feelings, then I probably made the wrong decision. I have no regrets.”

In their first three seasons, two-meter Matt Burton, goalie Joel Dennerley and driver Peter Kurzeka, all part of USC coach Jovan Vavic’s historic 2008 men’s water polo recruiting class, formed a “Big Three,” playing integral roles on three championship teams. With the unit intact and complemented by an array of talent entering in 2011, the trio hoped to cap the greatest achievement imaginable in any collegiate sport: claiming a championship in all four seasons of eligibility.
USC won its unprecedented fourth consecutive NCAA title, but did so without its captain and All-American defensive stalwart, Burton.
Still got it · Redshirt senior two-meter Matt Burton was third among USC scorers in 2010 with 33 goals, finding the back of the net in 21 games. – Daily Trojan file photo
In the second game of the season, a 14-3 win over Cal Baptist, Burton hyper-extended his elbow, tearing a ligament and, in the process, unceremoniously ending his bid for the fourth consecutive title with his fellow All-American captains.
“You watch all of your best friends go through a whole season,” Burton said. “I was a captain of the team, yet I was always on the sidelines and sort of cheering from the stands, which was really tough, but extremely motivating.”
Now a redshirt senior, Burton, who initially faced the possibility of undergoing Tommy John surgery, a common procedure for baseball pitchers that requires a year of recovery, admits that at first he doubted his will to rehabilitate his injury and return for another season.
“Coming back from an injury is probably the hardest thing I’ve done in water polo,” Burton said. “It’s extremely frustrating, and you’re kind of out on an island by yourself.”
As a 2008 recipient of the Elite 88 Award, given to the player with the highest GPA among all NCAA men’s water polo tournament players, Burton’s intellect provided him with options outside of water polo post-USC.
Yet, the allure of winning a fifth title and trumping his former recruiting classmates proved too enticing. Burton subsequently earned admission to USC’s progressive master’s degree program in communication management, cementing his decision.
“Last year, it was devastating for him,” Vavic said. “He really wanted to play. It was good, though, because he matured from it and learned how important water polo is for him.”
After processing and negotiating the initial disappointment of the injury, Burton used his first stint as a sideline spectator since starting college to improve his understanding of the game.
“I had a chance to sit out of the pool and get to watch from the stands and see how the game is played,” Burton said. “It helped with my water polo IQ, and now that I’m playing, I’m seeing things more and becoming a better passer.”
There is no question in Vavic’s mind that Burton will reassume his customary leadership role quickly.
“Having him back is huge for us,” Vavic said. “He’s one of the hardest workers we’ve ever had. He’s committed to winning, committed to being a champion.”
And it’s not as if Burton is the lone remaining member of the 2008 squad. Drivers Andrew Reego and Michael Rosenthal and two-meter Brian Boswell, who all had a year of eligibility remaining after redshirting their freshmen years, will similarly return for their fifth seasons in the program.
“Boswell and Rosenthal have each been around for five years, and each of them brings something different to the table,” Burton said. “I’m more of the guy that’s on people’s cases urging them to work harder. They’re the nice guys who are always cracking jokes. Losing [Dennerley] and [Kurzeka] is huge, but we’re extremely fortunate. If it happened to any other team, it would be devastating.”
As a lockdown defensive specialist who also ranked as the 2010 team’s third leading scorer with 33 goals, Burton still acknowledges that USC’s young talent will vie for his and his redshirt senior classmates’ playing time.
“I’ve started and I haven’t started,” Burton said. “I’m not too concerned about starting, because I’m pretty sure I’ll get the same amount of minutes that I’ve always gotten. [Junior utility] Mace Rapsey is a great defender, and he’s earned his playing time. If he starts over me or if I’m starting over him it doesn’t matter, because we both complement each other well.”
As for his water polo aspirations after USC, Burton plans to play professionally in Australia, with the hope of earning an Olympic nod in the future. That said, he is uncertain whether a selection to the U.S. Olympic team is his ultimate objective.
“I’ve played on international teams, but the injury has changed my mindset a bit,” Burton said. “To work for four years toward an Olympic sporting event to only possibly get injured before it would be devastating. I know a couple of guys that has happened to, and I don’t know if I’m ready to make that commitment yet.”
Burton still has time to mull his future plans. For now, he is intent on reminding his teammates that the veteran can still play.
“[Staying] kind of works in my favor,” Burton said. “I have the chance to get five rings, and a lot of my friends decided to stick around with me. And I get the John McKay Center. I guess getting injured was pretty lucky.”

Surely by now you’ve heard a multitude of reasons why No. 3 USC will have a successful season. Barkley this, Woods that, Marqise Lee, the linebackers, Kiffin, whoever films practice or some little future Trojan in the 70th row of the Coliseum is contributing to its success.
Catching a break · After eking out a 38-35 victory before a raucous Autzen Stadium crowd last fall, USC plays Oregon at home on Nov. 3. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Well here’s one more. It’s something that affects every season, but isn’t often talked about when a team is as talented as this year’s Trojans.
Their schedule, relatively speaking, is easy.
Now don’t get me wrong; The Trojan’s schedule is not a cakewalk by any stretch. It never will be, so long as they play Notre Dame every year and the Pac-12 continues to play nine-game conference schedules.
But they get the Fighting Irish at home, avoiding an always-dangerous trip to South Bend, Ind. USC was embarrassed at Arizona State last year, but the Trojans get the new-look Sun Devils at the Coliseum this time around. And I don’t think you need to be reminded about Oregon.
Of course, every in-conference road game is tough. But consider this: Instead of the potentially disastrous trip to Tempe, Ariz., the Trojans instead play at Arizona. USC has not lost in Tucson since 1999.
The Trojans play in Seattle for the first time since they were stunned there in 2009. But Husky Stadium, measured as one of the loudest venues in college football, is undergoing renovations. Instead of playing on campus at the site of horrors for this USC team, they will play 20 minutes away at CenturyLink Field, home of the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks. Though CenturyLink Field is loud on Sundays, it will likely not be the same on Husky gameday .
Their one Thursday night game is at Utah. Thursday nights are often ripe for upsets. The game is on ESPN, and the novelty of it often gets the home fans way more amped than an average Saturday matchup.
But of all the Trojans’ road games this season, Utah could very well be the easiest place to play Thursday night. While most Thursday games create shortened weeks, the Trojans have a bye-week leading into the game, meaning they will not be playing with less practice time.
And come on, playing at UCLA hardly constitutes as a “road game,” anyway.
And the best part: The Trojans avoid a trip to Oregon State. In case you have forgotten, the Trojans haven’t won in Corvallis, Ore. since 2004. There is something about the omnipresent mist there that shrouds the Trojans’ national title aspirations into oblivion.
Stanford jumps out as a potential road trap game for USC. The weekender comes early this season — in week three —and there’s an excellent chance the Trojans will still be getting up to full speed.
But of all the in-conference road venues the Trojans will visit this year, Stanford Stadium will likely be one of the easiest, especially since they will be breaking in a new quarterback in the wake of Andrew Luck’s departure to the NFL.
Utah is at a significant elevation, which always poses challenges. CenturyLink Field is no Husky Stadium, but anyone who has watched a Seahawks game knows it retains more than its fair share of noise. And I’ve been to both Stanford Stadium and Arizona Stadium. Stanford sounds like an 8 a.m. general education course by comparison.
And there’s the small matter that the Trojans have lost three straight — and four of five — to the Cardinal. I think it’s safe to say USC will be more than motivated.
Of course, there is that pesky Oregon dilemma. When two teams are fairly even, it is nearly impossible for one to beat the other twice in one season (see LSU against Alabama last year). But that is presumably what will have to happen for USC to win the Pac-12 title, with the Ducks standing in the way.
But tell me: Do you really want USC to lose to Oregon on Nov. 3, which would put the title game in Eugene, Ore.? Or would you rather just have both games played here, even if that means it’s on the Trojans to knock off the Ducks twice?
Exactly.
The Trojans finish up their schedule with their last four games in the Los Angeles area, with the only “road game” being against UCLA. Pretty fortunate scheduling for a team with depth concerns.
As of now, the road to the Pac-12 championship runs through Los Angeles, not Eugene. You don’t need to be told that it’s better this way.
As with their road to Pasadena or Miami, the Trojans control their own destiny.

On July 12, 1912, at the Summer Olympics in Stockholm, USC freshman Fred Kelly readied himself to compete in the 110-meter hurdles against four other Americans and Great Britain’s Kenneth Powell.
It was expected he’d finish somewhere in the middle of the pack. But the preemptive favorite, 22-year-old John Nicholson, tripped over the eighth hurdle, and Kelly sprinted ahead of his opponents to take the gold medal with a time of 15.1 seconds. Not only did Kelly become the winner of the school’s first gold medal, but he unknowingly started a rich tradition of success unparalleled by other universities.
One hundred years after Fred Kelly won gold in Sweden, native Frenchman and USC alumnus Clement Lefert served as a member of France’s 4×100-meter swimming team that defeated Team USA in the closing seconds of the race. Lefert’s win at the 2012 London games continued the streak of at least one gold medal by a Trojan dating back to Kelly’s victory one century prior.
USC’s prowess at the Olympics is well documented — following the 2012 London games, the Trojans had accumulated 135 gold, 87 silver and 65 bronze medals for a total of 287. That puts them 16th overall when compared to every other country in the world, ahead of Canada, South Korea and Greece.
With 418 Olympians, USC has produced more Olympic athletes and medals since 1904 than any other college in the country. In comparison, UCLA has  accumulated 250 medals (125 golds), Texas had 73 gold medals and LSU, rival atop the latest college football polls, had 30 medals overall (15 golds).
One reason for USC’s Olympic success is the diversity of its athletes: In total, USC has fielded Olympians from 59 different countries.
In the 2012 London games, Cristian Quintero and Emir Bekric became the first Trojans to participate for their respective nations. Quintero, a sophomore, competed in the 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle swimming events for Venezuela but did not place. Bekric, also a sophomore, finished 14th in the 400-meter hurdles for Serbia.
Allyson Felix, who attended USC but did not compete for the Trojans, won gold medals in the 200-meter, the 4×100-meter relay and the 4×400-meter relay. Three USC players were on the gold medal winning women’s water polo team, while the men’s 4×400-meter relay team, which had Trojans Bryshon Nellum and Josh Nance finished in second place.
Apart from USC’s collective success at the Olympics, individual Trojans have carved out impressive legacies worthy of recognition in their own right. Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie, Cheryl Miller and Tina Thompson combined for eight gold medals and one bronze medal in women’s basketball, spanning from 1984-2008.
Leslie’s run was especially impressive, as the three-time All-American won four straight gold medals with the U.S. Her streak began in 1996 in Atlanta and ended shortly before retiring in 2008.
Swimmer Janet Evans took home four gold medals between 1988 and 1992 and also set a world record for the 400-meter freestyle that stood until 2006. She is one of six Trojans to be inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, joining swimmer John Naber, three sprinters (Charles Paddock, Parry O’Brien and Frank Wykoff) and diver Sammy Lee.
Lee had a particularly accomplished career, becoming the first Asian-American to take home a gold medal, a feat he accomplished twice. USC’s all-time leader in medals is swimmer Murray Rose, who won six (four gold, one silver and one bronze) between 1956 and 1960.
The 2012 games were the latest example of USC’s Olympic turnout. Since 2000, at least 40 Trojans have participated in Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London. This year, there were 41. And if the last 100 years of gold medals prove anything, it’s that the Trojans will continue to be an Olympic force well into the next century.

The Pac-12 launched a new group of television networks on Aug. 15, the first of its kind — a conglomerate of channels the college conference owns completely.
The Pac-12 Networks bridge the gap between nationally televised and local games that might otherwise not be available for viewing.
Last year, Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott toured the country, talking to sports fans and discussing their viewing experience as it pertained to the Pac-12. He found that many fans felt underserved by regular television coverage of their favorite conference. Not long after, the Pac-12 Networks were born.
Unlike the Big Ten, the only other college conference with a television network, the Pac-12 Networks utilize a national-regional split to produce even more content for each university. There are seven networks in all — one national and six local. Each local station — Pac-12 Los Angeles, Washington, Oregon, Bay Area, Arizona and Mountain — will focus on two universities in a particular region.
“All seven networks will have 350 of the same events,” said Pac-12 Enterprises president Gary Stevenson said. “On a local basis, there will be another 50 events from each school.”
Pac-12 Los Angeles will televise 350 national events along with an additional 100 games split evenly between USC and UCLA.
The Pac-12 also has a digital companion called Pac-12 Now, which promises to keep USC fans in the loop on a variety of devices as long as they are subscribed to a television provider broadcasting the Pac-12 Networks.
“At launch, we’ll have a TV Everywhere product called Pac-12 Now,” Stevenson said. “So if you’re an authenticated subscriber to Time Warner, you’ll be able to put in your authentication number, which is basically your subscription number, and get that same programming live on your PC or your iPad.”
The Pac-12 agreed to a broadcasting deal with carriers that make up roughly 40 percent of the U.S. television market, and conference officials hope to have deals in place with other carriers soon, most notably DirecTV. USC Auxillary Services said that USC cable services will have access to Pac-12 Los Angeles. They anticipate services will be up and running next week.
“We will have Pac-12 Networks in dorms as part of whatever the package is on campus,” Stevenson said.
As for what viewers can expect, the Pac-12 has loaded up on a wide variety of shows — pre- and post-game analysis, classic games and, of course, live events. USC’s first live football appearance on the Pac-12 Networks is set for Sept. 22, when the Trojans take on California at the Coliseum.
“We have 35 football games [in total] and three teams that will be ranked in the top 15 in the first four weeks of the season,” Stevenson said. “And those three teams alone — Stanford, Oregon and USC — will be on the network five times in the first four weeks. We’ll [also] have … over 135 men’s basketball games and another 600 or so Olympics sports.”
Stevenson is additionally proud of the Pac-12’s commitment to broadcasting an even number of men’s and women’s games.
“When we set out to do our programming grid of our 850 events, we had a matrix of things that we wanted to be considered. Nowhere in there was it [asked] if it’s a men’s sport or a women’s sport,” Stevenson said. “It ended up being 50/50 men’s and women’s sports, which was thrilling to us because it’s the 40th anniversary of Title IX, and there’s probably no further justification of the impact Title IX has had.”
On-air personalities, such as Rick Neuheisel, Yogi Roth and Bill Walton, and USC alumni Curtis Conway and Ronnie Lott, will take on big roles at the networks in calling and analyzing the action on the field and hardwood.
“Your on-air team has a lot to do with the look and feel of the network,” Stevenson said. “We have so many people on our team that really know and have experienced the Pac-12 brand. To have that kind of talent is something that we’re really excited about.”
Stevenson is aware of the hardships the Pac-12 Networks might face initially. Without funding from outside companies (the Big Ten Network is partially owned by Fox), achieving profitability could take time. But there are immediate benefits to USC and other schools in the conference.
“Imagine what being on 24/7 on seven networks and a digital network [can do],” Stevenson said. “The opportunities for students, the opportunities to promote the traditions and culture, the opportunities for coaches to recruit — there are just so many non-financial benefits.”
And for that reason, along with many others, Pac-12 executives are confident that they’ve created something unparalleled in the world of sports.
“Nobody has ever done anything quite like this — in college sports or, quite frankly, professional sports,” Stevenson said.

USC special teams coach John Baxter is quick to point out the cover of his unit’s practice plan, where the words “Attention to Detail” are splayed across the page.
Just for kicks · Sophomore kicker Andre Heidari hit 15 field goals last season and was named first team All-Pac-12 as a freshman. – Daily Trojan file photo
And on the field goal protection page, the headline reads “Count On Me.” The team says these words before each field goal, and that mentality is a big reason why the team has allowed zero blocked kicks in the two years Baxter has been with the team.
“I’m proud of that number,” Baxter said. “The bottom line is that you have to be vigilant in your approach and how you practice. Protecting the kicker and punter are paramount because we have two of the best in the country.”
It’s unusual for a special teams unit to garner so much attention, but two of last year’s most memorable plays occurred during kicks and punts. Former left tackle Matt Kalil blocked a last-minute go-ahead field goal attempt by Utah kicker Coleman Petersen — which redshirt junior cornerback Torin Harris then returned for a touchdown, ensuring the game did not go to overtime — and redshirt senior punter Kyle Negrete faked a punt against Washington, rushing for 35 yards and barreling headfirst into a defender.
Negrete, now heading into his second year after transferring from the University of San Diego, has earned his coach’s confidence. He averaged 40.1 yards on 39 punts last year. His directional kicking was also especially strong, as he downed 19 kicks inside the 20-yard line and kicked zero touchbacks.
“What’s so unique about the position that I play is that you can never master it,” Negrete said. “You have to be so technically sound. There were a few punts last year that I left out on the field, and I wasn’t too happy about it. People might say that I had a good season statistically, but there are definitely a couple of punts I want back.”
This season, Baxter has the luxury of having two punters at his disposal. Redshirt freshman Kris Albarado, a top-five punter in the nation coming out of high school, is expected to be used in certain long-distance situations and to put positive competitive pressure on the incumbent Negrete.
“[Albarado] is a really good player, and [he and Negrete] will go head to head,” Baxter said. “Punting is like pitching: You’ll bring a pitcher in for a certain situation. The difference is that once you pull a pitcher, you can’t put him back in. We can send in anybody we want.”
On the offensive side, Trojan fans should feel confident when sophomore kicker Andre Heidari steps onto the field. Heidari had a sensational first season, making 15 of 17 field goal attempts (with a long of 50 yards) and a perfect 50 for 50 on extra points. He averaged 65 yards per kickoff with 10 touchbacks, a number that figures to increase this season with the NCAA moving all kickoffs up to the 35-yard line.
Heidari, the former No. 1 kicking recruit in the nation, offers the Trojans a weapon few other college teams possess: a kicker who can consistently convert field goals from a distance greater than 45 yards.
“Last year, I hit a 50-yarder against Stanford, so if I’m anywhere between 50 to 53 yards, I think I have a good chance,” Heidari said.
On the other side of the ball, USC has created a reputation of wreaking havoc on opposing kickers. The Trojans blocked seven kicks last season, four of which were stopped by Kalil, who was drafted in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. Baxter insists that the entire unit, not just Kalil, was responsible for those blocks and that only a similar group effort will replicate the results.
“The challenge for our team is that [Kalil] was part of a unit that helped him get through,” Baxter said. “That unit was [Kalil], Christian Tupou and Rhett Ellison, so none of them are there now. We’ve got to redo that whole unit.”
The team might look toward two towering freshmen to replace Kalil’s kick-blocking prowess: 6-foot-8 offensive tackle Zach Banner and 6-foot-5 defensive tackle Leonard Williams.
“There are several guys that are going to have an opportunity to do that,” Negrete said. “Obviously, Kalil is a tough guy to replace with his experience and success, but that’s what training camp is all about.”
The kickoff and punt return game for the Trojans will be another key advantage. Two seasons ago, then-freshman receiver Robert Woods stood out in the return game, averaging 25.6 yards per return on 38 returns with one touchdown and earning first-team All-Pac-10 honors.
Last season’s return game was more of a group effort. Partly because of Woods’ ankle woes, Woods returned only 17 kicks and 13 punts last year and averaged less than before, with 23.1 yards per kickoff return and no touchdown returns.
Woods’ absence opened the door for others to step up. Sophomore receiver Marqise Lee averaged 28.5 yards on 10 kickoff returns with one touchdown while junior cornerback Nickell Robey averaged 11 yards on 12 punt returns.
All told, this special teams unit will continue to draw the attention of opposing teams’ coaches and their game plans.
“We made a pact that we were going to work harder than we ever have,” Negrete said. “We’ve been busting our tails throughout summer workouts to get better.”

USC had what many pundits consider the best offense in the history of college football in 2005. There were two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield and a pair of dynamic wide receivers. Two tailbacks ran for more than 1,300 yards apiece. The offensive line was experienced and the offensive attack was as balanced as it was prolific. That team averaged nearly 50 points per game. Even the week before the 2006 BCS national title game, ESPN ran a weeklong series comparing the Trojans’ offensive unit to some of the best in the history of the sport.
Man in charge · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley returns to lead an offense that averaged 35.8 points per game in 2011. Barkley threw a conference record 39 touchdowns and completed 69.1 percent of his passes. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Fast forward to 2012, and the expectation for many around Los Angeles is this: USC might have as good an offense, if not better, than what fans saw seven seasons ago.
Leading the USC offense will be its aerial assault, and the leader of that charge will be senior quarterback Matt Barkley. Last year, Barkley had one of the best seasons in conference history, throwing for 3,528 yards and 39 touchdown passes against seven interceptions. He set a school single season record for completion percentage at 69.1 percent.
Though Barkley’s success is largely because of his own ability, the overall success of the passing game will depend on his receivers: junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee. While Lee is at full strength, Woods has a lingering ankle injury that has limited his practice time and forced him to sit out for all of spring practice.
Woods set a conference record for catches in 2011 with 111, totaling 1,292 yards and 15 touchdowns, being named a first team All-American in the process. Woods’ high school teammate Lee had 1,143 yards and 11 touchdowns during his freshman season.
But if Woods is not healthy, the situation behind the two Biletnikoff Award candidates is rather murky. With no established third receiver, several young players will be competing for playing time, including sophomore George Farmer and incoming freshman Nelson Agholor.
“He’s constantly banged up,” Woods said of Farmer, who was the top receiver recruit in the country coming out of high school.
If healthy, though, Woods believes Farmer can play a key role for the Trojans.
The other question mark for the passing game is the left tackle position. Gone is All-American Matt Kalil, who was the No. 4 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. Taking his place will be sophomore Aundrey Walker, standing at 6-foot-6 and weighing 300 pounds who is slated to start at left tackle and to protect Barkley’s blind side. He has lost roughly 70 pounds since last season and is preparing himself for the rigors of the left side and of replacing a star.
“Everything’s been good,” Walker said. “Practice, the last practice has been great. Just losing the weight, I feel great. I don’t know what it is, but when I was 360 [pounds], it really didn’t work; I was too slow off the ball.”
This is no longer a problem, though, and Walker is excited for the possibilities. He is confident that the offense is right on track and sees a lot of potential with the group.
“[The] offense is doing pretty good. We got a great group of guys [starting],” Walker said. “[There is] a lot of chemistry throughout the whole team.”
The passing game was an obvious strength last season, as the Trojans averaged more than 294 yards per game, good for 15th in the country.
For the 2012 Trojans to reach the heights of the 2005 team, however, the running game will have to hold up its end of the deal and must complement the passing game.
Last season, the Trojans ran for 162.6 yards per game, which ranked near the middle of the pack in the college football world. Returning is senior tailback Curtis McNeal, who ran for 1,005 yards. Joining him is Penn State transfer Silas Redd.
McNeal said he expects this offensive unit to put up some big numbers this season.
“It could be really good,” McNeal said. “We just got to go out there everyday and get our game plan that the coaches make for us, and we just got to make plays.”
He knows that the running back competition is going to make for a better unit overall.
“It’s been good,” McNeal said. “All the running backs, we’re just out here competing, making each other better … and just providing the best running game that we can for the team.”
McNeal believes that the work the team put in during the offseason is going to make this edition of the Trojans better than the one fans saw last year, perhaps making the comparisons to the Leinart-led Trojans not too far off.
“A lot of players have just stepped up, basically the whole team just stepped up and we worked our butts off in the offseason so we can perform at our peak every game,” McNeal said. “That’s the attitude that we have, and we’re pushing it everyday.”

On Nov. 26, UCLA’s trendy all-white uniforms trudged off the Coliseum field — stained beyond recognition with dirt and embarrassment — and an endless stream of USC players lined up to conduct the Trojan Marching Band.
At that moment, most USC fans wished the 2012 season could start the following Saturday.
Instead, USC fandom entered the offseason with a hint of foreboding and with fear that four key upperclassmen, including quarterback Matt Barkley and safety T.J. McDonald, now seniors, would defect to the NFL one year early.
And as we learned last July, there is always the possibility during the summer that a key starter will drunkenly parade through Hollywood while on TMZ, anoint USC the “University of Sexual Ballers” and earn an early-season suspension.
Thankfully for the program, USC emerged from this offseason unscathed, avoiding the type of embarrassing publicity and negative momentum that could derail its season before it even began.
Other top programs weren’t so fortunate.
LSU cornerback Tyrann Mathieu, one of college football’s most electrifying playmakers, was kicked off the team for repeated disciplinary issues.
Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees kneed a police officer in the chest at a summer off-campus party, finishing the night with four misdemeanor charges.
And TCU saw four of its most enterprising players caught in a campus-wide drug sting.
Amid the horrific revelations from Penn State and the offseason gaffes of notable players from other top programs, USC players represented their school honorably, most notably when Barkley and his family led 15 teammates to Haiti on a humanitarian mission.
Of course, it is insulting to praise USC players for avoiding the police blotter — that’s an expectation, not an achievement.
But what the summer record reinforces is that USC coach Lane Kiffin’s squad continues to understand that no single player supersedes the interests of the team.
USC players either chose to make news for the right reasons or, more cynically, didn’t get caught doing anything bad.
Knowing the upstanding veteran leadership on this team, I choose to believe the former.
Kiffin has shown he will not tolerate players who forget USC’s main objective: To win as a team, not for players to pad their individual statistics in hopes of attracting NFL interest.
For Kiffin, it’s all about instilling a team culture of selflessness.
That’s why left tackle Matt Kalil, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft, in addition to allowing zero sacks during the 2011 season, also moonlighted as a kick-blocking specialist, blocking four kicks and sporting massive welts on his arms to prove it.
That’s why redshirt senior Chris Gallipo did not publicly gripe when freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson replaced him in the starting lineup midway through the season, although the move likely cemented the former Servite High School star’s fate of going undrafted in 2012.
Most importantly, that’s why the program jettisoned troubled talents like Dillon Baxter and Markeith Ambles, who bemoaned their inability to pass less-heralded prep prospects on the depth chart and were disinterested in earning Kiffin’s trust.
Despite Kiffin’s reputation as a disciplinarian, he has proven willing to afford his players the opportunity to pay their penance for mistakes and return to the team with a clean slate. Perhaps the greatest testament to this philosophy is redshirt senior running back Curtis McNeal, who, after failing to qualify academically in 2010, developed into one of the elite offensive weapons in the Pac-12.
In a strange way, the sanctions and resulting scholarship reductions have allowed Kiffin to clean house of malcontents. Players who care more about playing for themselves than USC won’t receive any resistance from Kiffin when seeking a transfer. After all, he already has to field 10 fewer scholarship players than other schools.
Unfortunately, selflessness is not always taught to decorated USC recruits who earn a trove of awards and media exposure before ever even arriving on campus.
Yet the majority of them will never achieve the superstardom they once thought inevitable. Some will have to accept unglamorous, ego-crushing roles, such as impersonating the opposing teams’ players on scout team during practice or backing up a young up-and-comer.
On the other hand, the reality of reduced scholarships during the sanctions era is that a lack of depth will force the coaching staff to ask too much of certain star players and count on them to deliver.
In this case, the image of junior wide receiver Robert Woods sustaining a bone-crunching hit on kickoff return, dusting himself off and catching the first few passes of a series readily comes to mind.
It will be USC’s continued ability to preach team over self — to have players accept diminished roles or to take on an unfair amount of responsibility — that will determine whether the Trojans can take care of their “unfinished business.”

Perhaps no player embodies USC’s recent defensive transformation more than sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey. In part, that’s because of his size.
Speed kills · Three sophomores anchor USC’s linebacking corps. Dion Bailey (18) and Lamar Dawson (55) combined for 106 tackles in 2011. – Daily Trojan file photo
Bailey stands at 6 feet tall and weighs 210 pounds, which is roughly the size of the prototypical wide receiver or defensive back, not the standard linebacker. He’s smaller than most at his position — so small that USC might not have even offered him a scholarship 10 years ago. But he is quick: His motor rarely stops running, and he can cover a lot of ground.
A converted safety, Bailey starkly contrasts some of the Trojans’ recent All-American linebackers, such as Brian Cushing and Rey Maualuga, who were each at least two inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Bailey.
But Bailey represents the latest trend in college football and at USC: prioritizing speed over size.
“We do that on purpose,” said Scottie Hazelton, the Trojans’ linebackers coach. “We get speed guys in there, because when teams go to the one-back or the spread stuff, you need a guy like that to run outside the box. The days of the big 250-pound linebackers are gone.”
As the season opener on Sept. 1 against Hawai’i nears, USC’s defense has evolved to emphasize speed as a way to stop spread offenses, which are increasingly common throughout the Pac-12 and college football.
The spread is an umbrella term that describes a variety of wide-open offenses that range from the zone-read option installed by Chip Kelly at Oregon to the Air Raid offense triggered under Mike Leach at Washington State.
There are variations, but the unifying principals are these: no huddle, shotgun snap, one running back, no fullback and four or five wide receivers.
The goal, first and foremost, is to spread defenders across the width of the field to give running backs and receivers more space. This is why hybrid linebackers in the mold of Bailey are so common nowadays, smaller but more comfortable in pass coverage and closing in to tackle a player in space.
Defenses, especially out west, have adjusted in the hope of slowing down teams that utilize the spread system, most notably Oregon. And it’s easy to grasp why: The Ducks have won three consecutive conference titles while averaging more than 40 points per contest in each of the last two season — the first school in Pac-12 history to do so.
“We’re getting more speed on the field,” Bailey said. “We’re not playing in the SEC, you know, ground and pound. We have to be able to run sideline to sideline. That’s how we’ve built our defense.”
Naturally, the Trojans’ top two strongside linebackers are now converted defensive backs in Bailey and senior Tony Burnett, who moved over during the spring.
“Really, your linebackers are becoming defensive ends, your smaller [defensive] backers are becoming your inside backers and your safeties are becoming outside linebackers,” Hazelton said. “It’s the way of the world.”
Hybrid defenders give schools an advantage in that coaches don’t have to change schemes. They’re not tossing aside playbooks and changing philosophies to combat the spread. They’re targeting different types of athletes.
“You have to recruit differently,” said USC defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron. “More speed. And it’s not just speed. These guys have to make plays in open spaces, because the spread teams’ll create one on ones.”
Initially, teams combated the spread by instituting “Nickel” or “Dime” packages that would bring in an extra defensive back, or two, as in the latter case. This strategy, however, would mean their defenses would be vulnerable against a good running game or a balanced spread team.
So for USC, which has utilized a 4-3 defense for the last decade, four down lineman and three linebackers, it doesn’t need to dramatically switch schemes. It’s just using different players such as Bailey, big enough to inch close to the line of scrimmage and stop a bruising fullback, and quick enough to stay with a speedy wideout 20 yards down field. And it can disguise coverages, too.
But this defensive makeover, so to speak, hasn’t occurred overnight.
Two years ago, USC posted its worst statistical season since 1955, giving up 400 yards per game — a program worst. And through the first five games last fall, that average mark improved by just 20 yards per contest.
“Oh, we were still new to the system,” Bailey said, trying to hold back a grin. “Our first year, we were extremely bad. Our second year, we were just trying to turn it around. We had a lot of new guys. Now, we actually have some experience.”
The Trojans certainly do have some experience with eight returning starters back on defense, including injured senior defensive end Devon Kennard, who tore a pectoral muscle in late July and could miss most of the season. The entire back seven returns, highlighted by preseason candidate for the Thorpe Award as the top defensive back and All-American free safety T.J. McDonald, who chose to forgo the NFL draft and return for his senior season.
And then again, there’s also Bailey, who along with sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard, who last year led the team in tackles with 81.
“We have all the guys in place,” McDonald said. “We have to keep doing what we’re doing, but I think we’ll be that shutdown defense that everybody is asking for.”
