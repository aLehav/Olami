The Women of Troy were unable to muster a comeback Sunday on the road as Colorado recorded its first conference win of the season in a 66-63 nail-biter.  
Colorado (6-15, 1-9) junior Haley Smith scored a game-high 18 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in the victory over USC (16-6, 4-6).  Freshman Kennedy Leonard scored 17 points, including a crucial layup with 30 seconds remaining that extended the Colorado lead to 64-58.  Fellow freshman Alexis Robinson chipped in 10 points of her own. 
Temi Fagbenle led the Women of Troy with 17 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. Sophomore guard Sadie Edwards followed up her 24-point performance against Utah with a 14-point performance Saturday. 
Colorado came into today as the worst team in the Pac-12 but they played the game with more energy and poise than the Trojans. Colorado was able to wear down the shorthanded Women of Troy — who were visibly tired in the closing moments of the game — by pushing the pace and moving the ball.
It was a disappointing start for the Trojans as they struggled throughout the first half on both ends of the floor. USC committed nine turnovers while shooting 8-of-22 from the field on the offensive end while allowing Colorado to shoot 14-of-27. USC was fortunately able to head into halftime only down 31-27, able to keep within striking distance by attacking the basket aggressively, resulting in 12 free-throw attempts, eight more than Colorado.  
The Women of Troy didn’t play much better to start the second-half, shooting 2-of-10 to begin the third quarter while playing substandard defense. USC switched up to a full-court press but this was ineffective for much of the third quarter as Colorado was able to move the ball effectively, leaving the Women of Troy scrambling on defense. The Buffaloes were able to extend their lead to 47-41 heading into the fourth.
The Trojans started the fourth quarter much better, strongly attacking the basket and relentlessly pressuring Colorado into careless turnovers and bad possessions.  The Women of Troy were able to tie the game at 51-51 on a layup by Fagbenle but Colorado immediately countered with a layup by Kennedy Leonard to retake the lead.  Colorado continued to hit shots and outhustled USC to notch its first conference victory of the season.
The Women of Troy suffered a brief scare in the second quarter when Edwards turned her ankle while trying to help on defense. Edwards fell to the ground and came up limping. Fortunately, she was able to return later in the second quarter after being evaluated by medical personnel.  
With the loss, USC drops to 4-6 in conference play and remains in a tie with Utah and Oregon for sixth in the standings.  The Women of Troy continue their road trip next week with games against Arizona and No. 8 Arizona State.

The USC Trojans fell to the No. 6 Stanford Cardinal in four sets (20-25, 25-19, 19-25, 8-25) at Galen Center Sunday night. 
Despite battling and emerging victorious over Pepperdine last week, the Trojans (1-7, 1-5 MPSF) fell flat in the fourth set against the Cardinal (7-1, 5-1 MPSF), costing them a chance at another 5-set match. 
Sophomore opposite Jon Rivera once again led the Trojans with 13 kills while hitting .154. Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught tallied up nine kills while hitting .174. 
Head coach Jeff Nygaard talked about how it’s good to see Rivera lead the team in consecutive matches, but he’s always looking for his players to continue to grow and improve.
“Is it surprising that he’s doing it? No, because I know what he’s capable of,” Nygaard said. “There’s always something to get better at and I’d love to see him become the blocker that I know he can be.”
Rivera himself seconded the notion about becoming a better blocker. He trusts that he’ll be able to continue to improve at USC because he has “great coaches, great setters, great teammates” that all believe in him and push him to be better. 
“I’d say I have a lot to improve in,” Rivera said. “Being a more aggressive server and blocking — that’s my main deficiency, I would say. And I would say having a more aggressive mentality overall.”
Looking at the team as a whole through the match, Nygaard noted how the team lost their focus and met their match against a team that was playing to their potential. 
“On any given night in the MPSF that can happen,” Nygaard said. “There’s no team that’s just unbeatable, but by the same token, you do have to perform.”
Part of Stanford’s dominance was thanks in part to their setter James Shaw. Shaw put up 46 assists and recorded seven kills. 
“They’re setter does some things that we don’t see so often,” Nygaard said. “He takes the ball really high which doesn’t seem like a big change. But when you’re used to certain things and then you have a certain visual field because of it, all of a sudden he’s way higher.”
The height that Shaw sets at put the Trojans at a disadvantage. 
“It changes how you block,” Nygaard said. “Over time it really rattles a younger inexperienced blocking group.”
Through the third and fourth sets, Nygaard rotated some new players in to switch up the lineup. Despite the Trojans dropping both sets, Nygaard still liked all of the lineups that he saw. 
“That’s the great thing about this team is that our skill level and depth,” Nygaard said. “I trust everyone on this team to get done what needs to be done.”
Rivera talked about how the team needed to make adjustments to get used to the altered lineups. 
“We always practice with a certain squad and when we start getting guys in and out, you know people don’t know that—we’re just not that used to it,” Rivera said. “I think we need to get better as a team on that, and it’s something we need to adjust, it’s an easy adjustment [because] we’re all great players.”
Everything seemed to more or less fall apart in the fourth set. The eight points that USC scored were the fewest in a non-fifth set since 2001 when rally scoring began. 
Stanford outhit USC in the final set .500 to .192. The Cardinal outscored the Trojans 22-4 to close out the set. 
Despite dropping the match, Nygaard still sees growth in his team: they’re looking “more like men on a daily basis.” He is still optimistic about the team’s ability to improve and play to their full potential. 
“I expect my team to work hard and try and beat the next opponent,” Nygaard said. “We’ve got to continue to get better, continue to improve, and continue to buy in. There’s no other direction to grow.”
The Trojans will hit the road next week. They face No. 9 UC Irvine (2-6, 1-5 MPSF) on Friday and UC San Diego (3-6, 0-5 MPSF) on Saturday.

At the entrance of the Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education in Leavey Library, a framed picture of survivors hangs in the hallway with a quote from Holocaust survivor Walter Thalheimer encapsulating their mission: “When you see an injustice, stand up, speak up, take a stand.”
Founded by Steven Spielberg in 1994, one year after his Oscar-winning film Schindler’s List, the USC Shoah Foundation  preserves testimonies of genocide survivors, employing inventive technology to expand their audience.
The Shoah Foundation initially sought to highlight stories of survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust. Now viewed as the world’s largest archive of genocide testimonies, these personalized accounts illuminate stories of survivors around the world.
As the organization expands the conversation to recognize more incidents of genocide, the foundation plans to further develop the Visual History Archive Program. The program enhances how users can connect to these testimonies. Currently housing a collection of more than 53,000 eyewitness testimonies of genocide, the Visual History Archive has seen considerable growth since its inception. Now, by using their search engine, finding these testimonies only requires clicking a few buttons. These testimonies are provided by witnesses from 63 represented nations and in 39 different languages.
One of the foundations many testimonies includes one by Liu Suzhen, who after 80 years revealed her experience surviving the Nanjing Massacre. With the death toll of the massacre at 300,000, her testimony will be added to a well-established reserve of fellow survivors. Described by the Los Angeles Times as the “bloodiest episode in the Chinese theater during World War II,” her memories during this two month rampage will be used to educate and inspire.
As the foundation moves forward, they are discovering new ways to maximize outreach initiatives. According to public communications manager Josh Grossberg, the current goal of the Shoah Foundation is to continue expanding.
“Right now we are available at 50 university museums around the world,” Grossberg said. “Our demand is growing and we want to reach as reach as many people as possible.”
The program has plans to implement a five-year plan sought to increase accessibility on more platforms and introduce a new Visual History Archive platform leading to better search results.
A major component of the Shoah Foundation is its use of cutting-edge technology which gives people a chance to interact with these personal stories in unique ways, according to Grossberg.
“We are recording and interviewing Holocaust survivors using new technologies that allow for us to record for voices using voice recognition software with the goal of people actually being able to ask questions to a three-dimensional image of a survivor and engaging in a conversation with them,” Grossberg said.
As the foundation continues to educate the next generation by applying technology to shed light on these testimonies, they hope to further advance in time for the institute’s 25th anniversary in 2019.

USC alumnus Adam Schechter is working with the Viterbi School of Engineering to develop Fuppy, an app that aims to help dogs and cats in shelters get adopted.
The app works with an Uber-like interface where users can first use filters to choose the type and size of the animal they are looking to adopt, and then the app pinpoints the locations of the shelters where these animals live.
Each animal has a picture and biography to help users choose the one they believe will fit their lifestyle best. After choosing, users can foster the animal for seven days, after which they will get the option to adopt, return it to the shelter or keep it until someone else chooses to foster it.
“Users are encouraged to upload pictures and videos of the animals in an attempt to foster a Yelp-type community to help user engagement and really help promote the animal,” Schechter said.
Schechter’s journey with Fuppy began when, after graduating from USC with a bachelors in economics and a masters in accounting, he started volunteering at West L.A.’s No Kill L.A. shelter while working as a full-time CPA. After volunteering for a few years, Schechter understood the way that the shelter conducted business and noticed that the system could use an update.
“In this day and age, we’ve come so far with mobile apps and connectivity that we could take this industry and really get it modernized into the 21st century,” Schechter said.
Schechter found that when he would take the shelter dogs out for walks, everyone around him would always run up to the dogs and ask where they were from, unaware that there was a shelter just 50 feet away from them.
“It occurred to me that we just need a way to connect these awesome animals with these people who may want them, and that’s the great thing about technology is the connectivity,” Schechter said.
Six months ago, Schechter reached out to USC engineers through their Facebook group, posting a description of the app and asking if anyone would be interested in helping him out. Vivek Sharma, an Android developer, and Ayberk Yilmaz, an iOS developer, came on board and told Schecter to apply for Blackstone LaunchPad USC, an Annenberg Innovation Lab program that, according to its website, provides “aspiring entrepreneurs with the tools and supportive mentors they need to transform untested ideas into vital companies.”
Blackstone LaunchPad provided Schechter with a business advisor, who told him to partner with the engineering school. This move secured him the help of 14 computer science graduate students who are currently working on the development of the app’s technology for their directed research class this semester. Schechter also received assistance from the USC Gould School of Law, which helped him complete all of his legal incorporation and 501(c)3 filings.
According to Schechter, one of the most rewarding moments of these past six months took place when he overheard the excitement and ideas after he presented the concept to the graduate students. His research also brought him to several animal shelters where the employees were excited about the effect the app could have on L.A.’s burgeoning shelter populations and said they would be on board as soon the app is completed.
The first full version of the Fuppy app is expected to be completed by the end of the semester and will be available initially for the L.A. area, but in time, Schechter hopes to expand the app nationwide.

The USC Admissions Center  said  that it only looks at a potential student’s social media profile in extraordinary cases in response to a recent survey by Kaplan Test Prep, which found that the percentage of universities across the nation that are using social media to evaluate prospective undergraduates has reached an all-time high.
The survey, released this month, polled 387 college admissions officers and found that 40 percent used applicants’ social media pages to learn about them. Those polled represented a mix of private, public, large and small institutions from every region in the United States.
Kirk Brennan, associate dean and director of USC admissions, said that the role of social media in admissions is minimal at USC, with few circumstances leading admissions officers to use the internet to explore an applicant’s information.
“The Kaplan statistic showed to me that there is very little regular use of social media in the application process,” Brennan said. “While the number of people who say they have used it seems to be growing, the number of people who use it pretty regularly is pretty small, and when you multiply the two, the total number of readers using it is very small.”
Brennan explained that a circumstance, such as an anonymous tip leading officers to question the authenticity of a student’s application, could result in the monitoring of social media. He also said that because USC receives one of the largest applicant pools in the country, there are a significant amount of applicants who hold prominence, for example in the entertainment industry, which requires greater online monitoring.
“We don’t have any kind of policy about forbidding looking at applicants social media content,” Brennan said. “However, the foundation of our process is built on the respect of the applicants, and we understand that this whole process is built on trust … We’re going to take reasonable steps to make sure that this work is their own.”
Eighty-nine percent of polled officers said that they rarely went online to research about their prospective students. Brennan explained that this remains true for USC’s Office of Admission, as officers are often responsible for thousands of applications at a time and simply do not have the time to patrol students’ online profiles.
“I think students need to be careful and need to know not just for college admissions but for jobs and finding a mate or communicating with friends, that the things they say online are open for all to see and subject to interpretation and requires a finer level of attention,” Brennan said. “We’re looking for students who seem to have an understanding in how we can help achieve their goals in doing that, and it’s very strange for social media to have an impact.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath said that she has witnessed her peers utilizing media in different ways while applying to post-bachelor degrees. Sampath mentioned that journalism majors frequently use Twitter and Facebook to supplement their work for job opportunities and graduate programs.
“As a student, I’ve seen so many of my friends who are applying to law schools or graduate programs change their names on Facebook — they go to great lengths to hide themselves from admissions’ eyes,” Sampath said. “But interestingly, I’ve also seen students use media as a tool to continue their application.”
Kelsey Borenzweig, a sophomore majoring in political science, said that even if admissions officers were to assess applicants’ media profiles, there would be a neutral effect as most students would not typically have any information or posts that would harm their ability to receive admittance to the University.
“For the most part, it would have a pretty neutral effect because generally speaking most people’s social media profiles do not have things that are terrible,” Borenzweig said. “If admissions officers were to look at their profile, there most likely would not be something that would cause the officer to not admit a student to the school.”

The No. 8 men’s tennis team maintained its undefeated season and moved to 3-0 on the year after outlasting No. 20 Florida in a tight match in the Pac-12/SEC Showdown. Big play from the Trojan freshmen secured the match.
The Trojans were scheduled to play Georgia on Sunday in their second match, but inclement weather prevailed. The match was canceled and will not be rescheduled.
While the sun was still shining on Saturday, the Trojans and the Gators battled at the Los Angeles Tennis Center in Westwood. USC would go on to win the match 4-3.
The Men of Troy were able to take the early lead after they won the doubles point. The No. 3 spot on the roster, the team of junior Rob Bellamy and freshman Jake DeVine, powered to an early 6-2 victory.
The win was complemented by the unranked team of senior Max de Vroome and freshman Jack Jaede, who upset the No. 40 team in the nation with a score of 7-5. With two of the three matches already in USC’s favor, play was suspended between the No. 1 teams that were still playing.
Sophomore Thibault Forget, playing from the No. 6 spot, gave the Trojans a 2-0 advantage in the match with his 6-3, 6-0 win. USC then took a 3-0 lead behind the play of freshman Logan Smith. Smith is ranked No. 69 in the country and beat Florida’s No. 63-ranked Chase Perez-Blanco 6-3, 6-1.
From there, USC would lose the next three singles matches, and Florida tied the match 3-3. No. 1 singles player and No. 115 in the nation, de Vroome lost to Florida’s Diego Hidalgo, ranked No. 31 in the country, 4-6, 3-6.
No. 41 in the country, junior Nick Crystal, also dropped his match, losing to No. 49 Elliot Orkin 3-6, 4-6.
The tying match came when Florida’s Gordon Watson beat Jaede in two close sets, 6-7, 5-7.
The Trojans prevailed behind No. 83 DeVine who battled No. 91 Alfredo Perez and won in two tight sets, 7-6 (6), 7-5.
The Men of Troy will now turn their attention to next Saturday when they will have a double-header. USC will host Grand Canyon and LMU at Marks Stadium at 10 a.m and 2 p.m. respectively.

For the majority of the USC football team, the 2015 college football season ended on Dec. 30, 2015, with the Trojans 23-21 loss to the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2015 National Funding Holiday Bowl.
For seniors Cody Kessler and Soma Vainuku, however, their seasons ended with their participation in the 2016 Reese’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, on Saturday.
The Senior Bowl, established in 1950, was originally played in Jacksonville, Florida before being moved to its current location at Ladd Peebles Stadium in Alabama.
With the college football national championship happening weeks prior and the Super Bowl always happening a week later, the annual contest allows college football’s best senior players to showcase their talents.
The two teams, the North and the South, are coached by a chosen NFL coaching staff and feature athletes at the top of their athletic prowess.
Before the game on Saturday, Kessler illustrated in an interview with the Los Angeles Times the expectations involved in not only the Senior Bowl’s practices, but also the game itself.
“They want to see how you can practice in an NFL practice, in an NFL system and then, obviously, how you play when you get guys out there,” Kessler said. “It’s been a really good three days, and now you get to go out there and play against another team and get live reps.”
Kessler and Vainuku aren’t the only Trojans to have been awarded the honor of Senior Bowl participants. In fact, 83 Trojans have graced the field of the Senior Bowl, including former Trojan linebackers Clay Matthews, Brian Cushing and Rey Maualuga, running back Frank Gifford and defensive back Shareece Wright.
Past Trojan receiver and current NFL Hall of Fame member Lynn Swann was elected by the fans to the All-Time Senior Bowl Team.
In terms of quarterbacks, Kessler joins USC alums Kyle Wachholtz, Carson Palmer and John David Booty, while Vainuku is the first Trojan to attend the Senior Bowl as a designated fullback.
In this year’s battle for Senior Bowl supremacy, the North featured playmakers such as Ohio State wide receiver Braxton Miller, Arizona State running back D.J. Foster and Notre Dame defensive lineman Sheldon Day, while the South’s roster was highlighted by Baylor defensive end Shawn Oakman and Alabama quarterback Jake Coker.
Kessler was among four quarterbacks and 12 Pac-12 players chosen to represent the North team, while Vainuku was the North’s lone fullback.
Kessler also stated how he has adjusted to new professional-level coaching and his approach to improvement.
“I got a lot of great pointers,” Kessler said. “It’s been a really cool week to be able to hear their terminology and how they explain things. And then you watch film the way they watch and they explain everything. It has been great for me. I’m trying to take everything in.”
In the contest, Kessler completed just four of his 10 pass attempts for 45 yards, ranking third on the squad in total yardage behind Louisiana Tech’s Jeff Driskel and North Dakota State’s Carson Wentz, out of the FCS. Fellow Pac-12 QB Kevin Hogan went three of four for just 41 yards, while rushing for an eight-yard gain.
Vainuku, on the other hand, failed to reach the stats sheet as he was utilized for primarily blocking purposes.
Although the North lost the affair 27-16, Kessler led a 15-play, 80-yard drive which resulted in one of his overall 10 rushing yards going for a touchdown.
The game’s MVP Honors were awarded to Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott for his 13 yards rushing, 61 yards and one touchdown on 7-of-10 passing.
Other names that impressed were Ohio State tight end Nick Vannett and Southeastern Missouri State wide receiver Paul McRoberts, who caught three passes for 58 yards and four passes for 46 yards and a touchdown, respectively.
Looking at Vainuku and Kessler’s draft prospects, both are certainly in good position. The position of the selections, however, will become clearer as pre-combine workouts take place.
In response to scouts and potential NFL teams, Vainuku reaffirmed his commitment to working hard and proving teams wrong.
“I’m willing to get in there and work my butt off to show them that if they draft me,” Vainuku said. “Their number is not wasted.”
Vainuku sits as the fifth-best fullback on CBS Sports, projected to be selected in the seventh round overall behind fullbacks such as Kansas State’s Glenn Gronkowski and Wisconsin’s Derek Watt, brothers of NFL stars Rob Gronkowski and J.J. Watt, respectively.
Meanwhile, Cody Kessler currently ranks as the 12th-best quarterback on the board, falling to the sixth or seventh rounds in the draft.
The futures of the former Trojans are bright, however, with three months of preparation and examinations left until the 2016 NFL Draft in Chicago, Illinois.

The USC football team has shined on National Signing Day in the last few years. Two years ago it was securing the commitments of wide receiver and cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and offensive lineman Damien Mama all on the final Wednesday. Last year, USC made major improvements to its defense, closing on every high-value recruit, bringing in linebackers Porter Gustin, Osa Masina, John Houston and defensive end Rasheem Green.
These commitments on National Signing Day have allowed USC to vault to the top of the rankings and stockpile immense talent for the years to come. For the future of the USC program, hopefully this upcoming Wednesday yields similar results. Now recruiting isn’t everything, as former head coach Steve Sarkisian proved, but it is an absolutely essential element of building a program.
Since it’s only Monday, and the entire recruiting landscape can have a seismic shift in 48 hours, it is still too early to draw conclusions on the 2016 recruiting class. The early enrollees are a formidable group, led by Oluwole Betiku, who continues the Serra-to-USC pipeline, a versatile and fast defensive end who hopefully will develop into a terror for opposing Pac-12 offensive linemen. Matt Fink will add depth to the quarterback position, safety C.J. Pollard and offensive lineman Nathan Smith should do the same in the defensive secondary and along the offensive line respectively.
In the spring, USC got two big, physical and fast wideouts in Michael Pittman– who dominated the southern California football scene this year– and Josh Imatorbhebhe from Georgia. In the Pete Caroll era, USC had a lot of success with strong, big receivers from the Southern region, namely Mike Williams and Patrick Turner. At 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, Imatorbhebhe isn’t quite as physically imposing as Williams and Turner but he has the frame and potential to make an impact moving forward.
The other recruits, who have indicated their commitment to enroll in the fall, include three other talented receivers, a tight end and one lineman on each side of the ball, as well as an outside linebacker. A few of these recruits are incredibly sought after, specifically Tyler Vaughns, who by almost every recruiting site metric is a top-five receiver.
However, outside of the four receivers and Betiku, USC has no dynamic instant impact recruits in the mold of Leonard Williams, Su’a Cravens, Jackson, Smith-Schuster, Iman Marshall or Ronald Jones II. Maybe that gets changed on Wednesday if Jack Jones, a star cornerback from Long Beach Poly commits as he is anticipated to, or if USC can snag talented lineman E.J… Price out of Georgia. Otherwise, USC’s class looks somewhat thin and underwhelming in contrast to the last few years, even the classes hamstrung by sanctions.
Recruiting is only one aspect of coaching; player development is equally critical and an area in which USC has floundered over the last few years. Not everyone is plug-and-play like Jackson and Smith-Schuster, but when the best players leave, it is important to have equally talented players waiting in the wings. USC didn’t replace Leonard Williams’ production last year, and if they don’t this year, it is going to be another long season of watching opponents glide through running lanes wide enough to fit a Mack truck.
Arguments can be made that recruiting rankings don’t mean much, and that the correlation is low between top 10 recruits and top 10 draft picks. That is true, but USC doesn’t need to dominate the top ten of the draft. They need linemen on both sides of the ball who could all potentially play one day in the pros. It’s great to have star receivers and tailbacks, but if the quarterback is running for his life and there are no creases to be found because of an anemic line, USC isn’t going to win very many games.
I like new coach Clay Helton’s desire to mold this Trojan team into a squad that is physically dominating and one that imposes their will. However, that only works if the Trojans are stronger and bigger than other teams, and they need talented linemen coming in on both sides of the ball each and every year. Look at Stanford and Alabama’s rosters, they are filled with top linemen who have been coached extremely well.
Part of it is improving the strength and conditioning program at USC, but even more of the challenge is getting the proper guys into school. Two years ago, USC landed offensive linemen Toa Lohbendahn, Viane Talamaivao and Mama. That vaunted class on the line was supposed to anchor the line for three years, but injuries and a failure to meet admittedly high expectations have cut that shelf life in half. You never know what recruits will turn into, which is why it is essential to bring in new talent on the line, each and every year, and then spend time coaching them up.
USC always recruits USC, it is just about where the focus and resources are channeled. Hopefully, Wednesday proves that the coaches didn’t overlook building out the lines, and USC has another exciting signing day. That is the key to building the Trojan program back up.

Award-winning novelist, essayist and journalist Jonathan Lethem provided USC students and faculty with tremendous insight into his meticulous writing process at a crowded Doheny Library. He read aloud an excerpt from his upcoming fictional novel about neurosurgery on Thursday.
Lethem’s reading, with its precise medical jargon, gave the viewer a window into the egotistical perspective of the eccentric neurosurgeon Doctor Beranger as he performs a brain surgery to treat a tumor. The passage, which constantly describes the face of the patient that is altered by the surgery, acts as a metaphor for the many uncontrollable challenges facing the individual and dramatizes the themes of time and humanism in an era when surgeons have the “God-like” power to save someone’s life.
In a Q&A after the reading, Lethem, author of critically acclaimed novels such as The Fortress of Solitude, Motherless Brooklyn, and Dissident Gardens, said that he does not use outlines or charts or take notes when he is planning a novel but that he sensitively visualizes and anticipates his novels’ topics and characters five years before writing anything down. Lethem, who is revered for creating obscure characters like Beranger or Lionel Essrog in Motherless Brooklyn who battles Tourette Syndome while solving a murder mystery, admitted that he draws on inspiration from the many “weird” people and experiences in his own life during this visualization process. For his upcoming book, Lethem recounted many life-saving trips to the hospital during his childhood illness for inspiration. Moreover, Lethem mentioned an example when he himself was at a hospital chapel waiting for someone he loved in neurosurgery when he described a few doctors who had come in to give him an update as, “Children, amazed with themselves and high beyond any drug trip that you could imagine; they were so high on where they were. It’s beautiful really, because it keeps them attentive and completely obsessed with this crazy and meticulous life saving thing. So, I wanted it to be drowning in technical jargon but I wanted to give a sense that they are on a total crazy high that is like an LSD trip.”
Lethem, although a famed essayist and journalist, admitted that he views himself as a novelist. He believes this because when he isn’t in the process of writing a novel he is writing one in his head. Lethem said that while journalistic or essay assignments have always been a literary response to something that happened in his life like, The Vintage Book of Amnesia: An Anthology on the Subject of Memory Loss,  the compulsiveness of his reading attention and the meaningfulness of the immensely different types of novels to him caused a type of  self-acceptance and realization that being a novelist was what he was born to do.
Lethem acknowledged that it is hard for him not to identify the main characters in all of his books with his own personality, and that this transfixed plight of the Beranger character to tune out the outside world in order to engage in his profession, mirrors his methods when writing a novel. Like Beranger who Lethem describes as an “old hippie” for listening to Jimi Hendrix throughout the day-long surgery, Lethem said that being a novelist causes him to exist in a kind of “cultural time stop” because he does not have time to know what other people think and talk about. And like his socks-and-Birkenstocks wearing character, Lethem said that because surgeons are such vain people, it is something that troubles them obscurely.
“Surgeons became God when God died. When the barber or the dentist went in to get your tumor or cut your leg off and see, you were all just helpless puppets of a cosmic plan,” Lethem said. “But once we entered modernity, there was this vacuum that swept all kinds of propositional God-like figures and I think that the surgeon who can save your life is one of those.”
Lethem, whose collection of essays The Ecstasy of Influence was referred to by USC English Professor Geoff Dyer in the introductory speech as, “one of the stupendous feats of intellectual conjuring which I have come across in the last several years,” Dyer said that Lethem dedicated endless hours to researching medical journals of surgeons writing about other surgeons’ intrepid facial surgeries. Because many of these journals were recorded audibly after the surgery when one surgeon would dictate the names of the technical medical proceedings from a taped video, Lethem said he was able to learn the language that was solely concerned with technical medical terms, which allowed him to add the metaphors about the landscape of the brain through his own prose.
“I like my novels to contain a lot me and a lot of different things,” Lethem said. “I want them to be like little worlds.”
Because of its critical acclaim and immensely popular reception, Lethem’s 2000 novel Motherless Brooklyn has been optioned by actor Ed Norton to adapt it to the big screen. And while Nick Hudson, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, said he went to the lecture in anticipation of the film, he also hopes that it can justly portray the fun and fast-paced Joycean word play that awarded the novel with the National Books Critics Award for Fiction.
“It was great to hear what Lethem had to say about Motherless Brooklyn because it contains such intellectual themes that proves his deep knowledge or research to achieve such mastery of the subject,” Hudson said. “I loved how it played with the genre of a detective thriller and added a nuanced exoskeleton in its plot through its main character with Tourette’s. It will be a fun film for sure.”
Lethem added that while all but one of his novels have been connected to making some kind of film, the fact that none have been done yet inspires him to continue to write novels. And although he said that he cannot think of a person better than Norton to play the part of Lionel, he admitted that he could live without seeing the possible disappointment of a poorly made attempt to do so.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that professor Geoff Dyer referred to Lethem’s The Ecstasy of Influence as “one of the stupidest feats of intellectual conjuring.” He said it was one of the stupendous feats of intellectual conjuring. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Any discussion of the #OscarsSoWhite campaign at this point probably sounds like a broken record. The issue has been so heavily debated in the past seven days, but it still bears discussion. Last week, I wrote about the Academy’s possibility of inflaming industry veterans with their hasty decision to cut off members’ voting privileges if they haven’t been active in the business for a while. Just because someone hasn’t made a movie in ten years, doesn’t mean they are out of touch with the current socio-political atmosphere and are less likely to vote diverse, right? We shouldn’t prejudice against those who haven’t had the chance to work, especially in such a historically infamous industry that is most famous for those elusive “15 minutes” and the perpetuation of the phrase “the younger, the better.” On the flip side of the argument is the unfortunate truth that there are a lot of industry vets who vote for their friends, not even bothering to watch most of the movie screeners that are sent out as awards season gears up. There’s no way to gauge if members have watched or not watched the films they’re voting for, and so the Academy has to crack down somewhere. The argument is muddied and seemingly, there are two sides to the story.
However, in a positive turn this weekend, the Screen Actors Guild Awards proved that Hollywood can, in fact, be open to progress. Idris Elba — who starred in Cary Fukanaga’s African war movie Beasts of No Nation this past year — won two awards in the night. It was wildly claimed that Elba was snubbed this year by the Oscars, many saying he should’ve been nominated for the Supporting Actor category. When he introduced a clip from the film during the awards, he prefaced them by saying: “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to diverse TV,” thereby reinforcing the idea that diversity must remain on the minds of consumers. After his first SAG win, he then went on to snag another for his role in the television series Luther. Uzo Adubo — most famous for playing Crazy Eyes in Netflix’s Orange is the New Black — won for the second year in a row, a tremendous indication of progression and inclusion, at least where the actors are considered. To vote for SAG, you have to be part of the Screen Actors Guild, which means that (mostly) directors, writers and producers are not involved in the nominating process. Does this indicate that actors are far more liberal and conscientious of equality? Or perhaps the heat from this year’s Oscars backlash finally made some change. The SAG Awards are notable in that they announce their nominations before the Academy did, but voting only finished on the 29th, meaning that the #OscarsSoWhite campaign might have had some influence. Or, the Academy is truly as dodgy and old-fashioned as many suggest, and the proof really is in the members who vote. Whatever the reason this weekend’s awards remain notable not only for those who won, but also for continuing the conversation that’s on everyone’s lips. If we are to see real change in this industry, the momentum must continue throughout the year. While the Oscars may seem like old or tired news at this point, the SAG Awards have maintained the need for this discussion.
All of these events are also important when turning an eye to the future of films, and the upcoming slate of movies for the next year. At the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, this past week, history was made when The Birth of a Nation — Nate Parker’s drama about slave rebellion leader Nat Turner — not only won both the Audience Award and Grand Jury prize, but Fox Searchlight Pictures also bought the film for $17.5 million dollars, the largest deal ever to be made at Sundance. When Kristin Wiig’s all female Bridesmaids grossed $288 million worldwide in 2011, studio executives had a chance to turn around and realize that female-driven films actually make money (surprise!). This revelation with The Birth of a Nation in the festival world seems to be a positive step in the right direction for increased diversity as 2016 begins to amp up. Purchasing a film for such a large sum is not only a show of confidence in the filmmakers, but also communicates the idea that the movie will have a large pull for ticket buyers — meaning we don’t need white movies to make money. While this isn’t necessarily a revolutionary concept for audience members, it may change the innermost cogs of Hollywood.
Last year it seems as if feminism was the buzzword on everyone’s minds. This year, let’s make it diversity. It’s about time.

The USC Thornton Symphony premiered their first concert of the semester Friday in Bovard Auditorium to a packed house, with a performance featuring Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 9. Conducted by artistic director and principal conductor Carl St. Clair, the orchestra shined and proved yet again what it means to be student musicians at the top of their craft.
Performing all four movements of Mahler’s Symphony No. 9, St. Clair was able to take full command of the orchestra, bringing them to the edge of their limits and bringing out the slightest details with his stoic and refined stance on conducting. The score proved to be exuberant and intricate, allowing St. Clair the ability to push the limits of controlled chaos while knowing the exact moments to step back.
The passion expressed by St. Clair on stage proved his passion not only for the world of classical music but also for music education. One could arguably say that St. Clair pushes his musicians further than conductors  elsewhere. The expectation and the caliber expected from the start make for nothing less than a superb performance.
An interlocking system of repetitive themes, Symphony No. 9 brings about both the cosmic and the minute details of the inner workings of the orchestra. The piece challenges the musicians to think both on the large scale, producing large lyrical phrases, and on the microscopic medium, pushing for an accuracy far exceeding audience expectations. Like an intricate puzzle, the sections and members orchestra knows just how to fit in with the orchestra at large. A mosaic of passages is easily executed with St. Clair’s expert musical leadership.
Much can be said for the soloists in the performance, especially concertmaster Ga Hyun Cho. The technical ability of Cho brought the performance to a high caliber and set the standard for what can be expected of student musicians in an extended symphony.
The fourth, and arguably most expressive movement of the symphonic work proved to be a high point of the evening. The orchestra took the audience on an exploration of themes presented in the first three movements, from musical fireworks to detailed themes. St. Clair was able to draw the deepest expressions out of the orchestra, leading to climactic passages highlighted with walls of sound, culminating in a descent into silence. Standing there with his baton, still in control of the intensity of the previous passages, St. Clair drew out the last moment of the movement in complete silence before lowering his baton, letting the audience absorb the impact of the multiple layers and intricate details expressed in Mahler’s symphonic world.
The concert proved to be a productive and worthwhile opening for the Thornton Symphony’s spring semester calendar and deserved nothing less than the standing ovation the orchestra received.

As the International Olympic Committee prepares to meet in 2017 to choose the host of the 2024 Games, Los Angeles is tweaking its proposal with the hope of winning the bid for the third time. L.A. has hosted the Olympics twice before, in 1932 and 1984. In ’84, the USC and UCLA campuses served as an athletes’ village, where Olympic competitors from around the world were housed and trained during the Games. However, this time around, the proposal is to house all 17,000 athletes and coaches and other support staff in UCLA residence halls; USC Village will house the media, providing helpful supplemental education to journalism students and avoiding the more unsavory aspects of hosting the Games.
USC has close ties with the Games, as it served as one of the Olympic Villages and hosted events at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Factoring in USC’s world-class athletic facilities and ample housing spaces, some might argue that it is a better fit for the Olympic Village. Nonetheless, considering the logistics of and alternatives to the existing plan, the LA2024 committee — which is charged with developing the city’s Olympic bid — made the correct decision.
Housing so many athletes on a single campus, especially one as small as USC’s, can be a tremendous burden. The athletes would need training facilities, dining halls, social areas and bedrooms, which could impact students’ activities and Trojan sports practices as the tentative ending date for the Games, Aug. 4, is only a short time before the start of the fall semester. Allowing the media to reside in USC Village will still require some adjustments for staff and students, but will not be as big of an inconvenience; the IOC sets a quota of 5,800 accredited members of the press for each Summer Games, and even with the Olympic officials who often reside in the media village, the amount of necessary space will be much less than at the athletes’ village. Though it is still possible that some athletes could use USC’s training facilities, they would likely not occupy the fields and courts as often.
Moreover, the culture that forms in the athletes’ village has historically been one of a raucous nature. Since parents and the press are denied access to the area, uncontrolled parties and — as U.S. Olympic soccer player Hope Solo detailed — markedly promiscuous behavior are the norm. This environment could present distracting and potentially dangerous situations for USC students. The media, conversely, would not create quite so risky conditions.
For any sympathetic Trojans who wonder why it’s fair to impose the unruly culture or spatial constrictions on UCLA, it is important to note that the current plan is far better than alternatives. The LA2024 committee has also considered a mostly unpopular option of building brand-new residences somewhere in the city. This would cost billions of dollars, a hefty addition to an already expensive event. With the media housed at USC and the athletes housed at UCLA, more money can be spent on any necessary renovations to sports venues and infrastructure.
An included benefit of housing the media at USC would be the supplemental education the Games would provide students. In the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, students would gain insights from some of the top media outlets in the world — without even leaving campus. The University boasts a state-of-the-art media center, which could benefit visiting press and allow students to engage with professionals.
If L.A. wins the Olympic host election, USC would tremendously aid the city in terms of financial savings — and gain revenue from rent in the process — while prospering from the more manageable and beneficial task of hosting the media. While the Olympic Games might require temporary changes, the event would create unparalleled experiences for Trojans and perhaps inspire further advancements at USC.

If you haven’t heard by now, there’s a presidential election taking place. No, I’m not referring to the one on the USC campus for Undergraduate Student Government but instead the one for the White House. The bid for the U.S. presidency is revving up today, as all the candidates stump across Iowa and the state’s caucuses get underway.
Hillary Clinton. Ted Cruz. Bernie Sanders. Donald Trump. And the list goes on. A whole slate of people to vote for. But how do the caucuses even work? I know they mark the first time in this year’s election when the American voter actually weighs in on who they want for president. It’s also a time when the media analyzes and projects what this could mean for the final leg of the race in November. But after those two reasons, I’m not even sure.
And I’m definitely not the only 20-something who is scratching her head at this process.
At this time last year we still had someone we could turn to that could fill in these knowledge gaps. His name was Jon Stewart and he ran this very funny Comedy Central program called The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. This show would help explain where we were in the country’s political process. Stewart held that position for 16 years — a majority of your lifetime if you’re a millennial reading this — and carried us through four presidential elections, a handful of congressional races and all the political scandals in between.
When I cast my first vote for a U.S. president back in 2012 in the race between President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney, I followed the election closely by watching clips of The Daily Show. I remember laughing along to Stephen Colbert’s satirical persona on The Colbert Report. Now, the greats are gone.
The Daily Show is still on with its new host Trevor Noah. Yet, as a recent Slate article showed, not as many people are tuning in. The ratings show Noah’s Daily Show is down 30 percent in the 18-49 age demographic, according to Slate.
This is compounded by the fact that at Stewart’s height, according to a Pew Research study, 21 percent of young people regularly turned into The Daily Show for campaign news, nearly tying the 23 percent of millennials who use ABC, NBC and CBS as sources.
We are now entering a period where every individual must educate him or herself on the issues at hand. There is still a presidential election taking place, with or without Comedy Central. As college millennials enter into the first election without a funnyman to help us make sense of it all, it is up to us to do our best.
We still have resources to help. Jenny Di heads the Political Student Assembly within USG. The organization works to guide students through the political process and build engagement. PSA holds viewing parties for large political events. Last month, they screened President Obama’s last State of the Union address. In the coming weeks they’ll be a viewing party for Super Tuesday.
Yet, despite the engagement efforts, Di said that she hears some disparaging remarks from students. Some students said that because they don’t follow the news closely they are not able to get involved in politics.
“You shouldn’t have to follow the news to think you understand politics,” Di said. “Even if they don’t know what’s going on, given basic information you still have opinion. If you have core opinions then you can connect.”
It’s basically what The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report did for us all of those years. They provided the information and we listened to their commentary. Agree or disagree with them, we now had the information to help us inform our opinions.
This election will also fully utilize social media platforms like Twitter. Before this time, people had to regularly tune into CNN or sit down and read a newspaper — shocking, right? To be informed, people made conscious efforts to research topics. Today you can just scroll through your timeline and see the articles your friends share or the candidates’ tweets.
Luckily, social media is a default tool for most millennials, so we are already ahead of the curve in consuming politics.
Now, it is just up to us to be willing to plug in politically. For most of you reading this, you’re not in Iowa. You won’t be going through the caucus system today. But the election is coming to a ballot box near you soon. It’s time to start preparing. You have all the tools you need to shape the political future of this country. Just use them.
