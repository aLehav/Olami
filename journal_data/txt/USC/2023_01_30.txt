Bathed in purple spotlights and blasting Charli XCX, the TCC Ballroom rumbled with excitement Saturday night as USC students, friends and family filed in for an evening of glam and camp at QuASA’s 13th Annual Drag Show: The Universe of Drag. 
The fashion show started early with an eclectic group of students in the stands dressed to impress: From T-shirt casual to lacy frocks and dangling chains, the audience was a sample bite of the show’s alluring and diverse three-course extravaganza.
The show was cooked up by executive director Hannah Gardiner, creative and talent director Saneel Sharma and production manager Erin Newsom of the USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly. Gardiner and Sharma also held roles as performers in the show. 
A junior majoring in English literature and East Asian languages and cultures by day, Gardiner transformed into Daisy Darling for the evening — a sweet, dollish figure adorned with bows and frills. Sharma, a sophomore majoring in design and marketing, unveiled the stunning looks of Ra Oblivion, a queen of sleek silver and glamor.
Both Gardiner and Sharma performed in last year’s QuASA Drag Show. Pulling from her experience as the former year’s drag intern, Gardiner knew that this year’s event would be the biggest yet with its show stopping effects. Rehearsals started in September to give the performers enough time to prepare their acts and plan the visual effects and sound.
“The stunts are amped up, all the tech is amped up,” Sharma said.
There was also an increase in the number of stunts performed in the show, Gardiner said. 
“[The stunts] are, I think, the biggest thing that stands out this year,” she said. “Last year, we had no stunts, which is fine. But this year we have three performers who are explicitly using stunts in their numbers.”
The show opened with a runway showcasing the plethora of drag queens, kings and self-described “drag creatures” in their multitude of outfits. The runway embodied the theme of “Universe of Drag,” illustrating the remarkable variety of drag styles. Lolitas, glamorous queens, rock ‘n’ roll kings and otherworldly creatures of the night flaunted across the stage.
The range in drag styles also reflected the gender and cultural diversity of this year’s drag show. 
“This year, we have three cultural, base performers that involve their own heritage,” Sharma said. “We also have a large variety of drag aesthetics, instead of being the typical high femme. We also have performers that just play around with gender both ways. It’s not specific to one side of the spectrum. It’s both. It’s all. It’s everything.”
Performances were split across two acts and many made extensive use of the ballroom’s lighting and technical capabilities. Drag performers embraced all aspects of the medium, especially highlighting their respective comedic, dancing and singing skills.
Scarlet Divinity is the persona of Monica Esquivel, a sophomore majoring in journalism and a queen who embraces her Latine identity through drag. Her standout performance involved her singing live in tribute to the legendary Selena Quintanilla. 
“[Selena] is someone that I’ve always looked up to,” Esquivel said. “Being able to perform her on stage and let my own dream live, as well as to pay tribute and in her memory is a great opportunity, I’m really grateful to have been given it.”
In addition to her musical performance, Esquivel emphasized the importance of community in queer spaces. 
“The more the merrier. The more inclusive … the [better] outcome that we’re gonna have, because we want to share drag to different facets of the world,” Esquivel said.  “Drag is a component that is really important to be able to as a collective, come together and share our lives through art.”
This year’s show was also notable in its number of drag kings and genderfluid performers. Tyra Durden is the bustling Wall Street-inspired drag king persona of Jesse Brindze, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies.  Brindze also held an administrative role as the Hair and Makeup Coordinator. 
“I was so happy that we have two kings [this year],” Brindze said. “It’s just a lot of diversity in terms of the types of performances as well, like some funny ones, some sexy, some kind of traditional RuPaul-style drag … There was definitely weirdness this year, which I fully support.”
For the first time in the history of the QuASA Annual Drag Show, the night ended with a series of lip sync battles. Audience members voted on which two performers they wanted to see compete. There was also a plethora of audience participation throughout the night as the host, Lorelei, brought crowd members onstage for dance battles and brief interviews. 
One of the lip sync battle winners, Willconique, said improv and collaboration in drag is powerful because of its evolving nature. Out of drag, Willconique is Will Yeaman, a freshman majoring in theater.
“There’s a part of drag that isn’t planned. Drag isn’t perfect. It never is. The show never goes perfectly. Tell that to all three nails I lost!” Yeaman said. “There were some boo-boos, but it all came together so beautifully.”
Yeaman emphasized the importance of providing opportunities for queer self-expression and community-building at USC.
“I have an amazing support system with my biological family, but not everyone gets that, so I don’t take that for granted,” Yeaman said. “As queer people, we also get to create a chosen family, and I think that’s really special.”
QuASA hosts a multitude of additional events for the USC queer and ally community, including the Second Chance Prom, a dance in the spring oriented for queer college students that dispels judgment and prejudice, and forefronts acceptance.
Adrian Perez, a sophomore majoring in public policy, said the themes of personal expression was their favorite part of the show. 
“The empowering messages throughout … showed that college students can do drag and from a very low price point, and we can all experiment with gender and just be ourselves,” Perez said. “It’s just a beautiful thing.”

Back in May, legislators in Sacramento were mulling over how to allocate California’s $97 billion budget surplus. The surplus’ size was so large that Governor Gavin Newsom, during the budget announcement, declared it as one that “no other state in American history has ever experienced.”
Less than a year later, the state is facing a deficit of $22.5 billion and, with it, the prospect of scraping through the barrel to continue funding its government programs. As the state government looks to shore up its balance sheet, higher-education institutions across California are likely to be hurt by funding cuts, creating a “huge problem,” said Christian Grose, a professor of political science and public policy at USC. 
“The higher public education system is about to take a big hit, and the governor and the state [are] going to have to figure out something to do about that,” Grose said.
In a budget proposal earlier this month for the upcoming 2023-24 fiscal year, Newsom promised to keep up his pledge of increasing base funding to succeeding universities in the University of California and California State University systems by 5% year-on-year, despite the deficit. In the same breath, the governor also proposed a drop in overall funding for higher education by 2.1%, to $40 billion — the first decrease in 10 years. The reduction includes the delay of billion-dollar projects revolving around the creation of housing for low-income students.
Although USC itself is relatively “insulated” from the direct effect of the state’s budgetary concerns because of its private school nature, Grose said, the repercussions extend to current undergraduate students headed to graduate school in-state and to those aiming to transfer into the University. 
Just weeks after the University of California system’s academic workers heralded historic wage gains in new labor contracts signed in December, California’s deficit has sparked further questions about UC’s ability to rely on state funds to help cover the costs. They are now scrambling to find ways of creating income to pay for them and are considering cutbacks in graduate student admissions.
“One of the benefits of California is that it has such a good education system, from community colleges to the UCs,” Grose said. “You don’t have to be affiliated with those institutions to see the economic benefits that come from that — and they are all facing some pretty serious budget problems.”
Funding would also be delayed for capital projects at UC schools that include the $200 million construction of an Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy at UCLA, $83 million to support a clean energy project at UC Berkeley and another $83 million for campus expansion projects at UC Riverside and UC Merced.
Delays to housing projects are causing concern among some legislators in the state’s capacity to tackle housing insecurity and the subsequent declines in enrollment across community colleges. Community colleges have lost 18% of their enrollment since the start of the pandemic; USC especially relies on community colleges for about 47% of its transfer intake.
The deficit that has developed since the announcement of last year’s record surplus means that the state government’s spending has far exceeded its ability to bring cash in through tax. It’s a reversal of economic fortune that Frank Zerunyan, professor of the practice of governance, said was “remarkable” — a “perfect storm” that stems from the previous year’s “irresponsible” spending.
“California lined up to dole out a bunch of cash to people [who] certainly needed it, and people that did not necessarily need it,” Zerunyan said. “When you govern, every cause is a great cause … California, with that budget surplus, was not able to say ‘no’ to a bunch of projects. The spending went crazy.”
California’s residents received financial assistance through stimuli known as the Middle Class Tax Refund in 2022. Lawmakers included the aid as a bill in last year’s budget as the state took advantage of its surplus, with direct payments of $350 to $1,050 being distributed to approximately 31 million Californians — more than three-quarters of the state’s residents. The program has cost the state more than $9 billion so far.
Falling tax revenues have also been attributed by economists to spiraling inflation and a weakening stock market. To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve has consistently hiked interest rates since March 2022, in turn slowing economic growth. Big Tech firms, including Google and Amazon, have each cut tens of thousands of jobs, and the lethargy in growth has extended to other sectors, such as banking. 
This has caused many wealthy individuals to make much less money through capital gains on their stock investments. In California, where the top 1% of earners account for nearly half of all the state’s income taxes due to its strongly progressive tax system, the downward effects have been huge for its revenues. 
“As the downturn has spread to the technology and finance industries, that has a direct impact on the stock market, and the fact that California has such a steeply progressive income tax system creates both an economic challenge and a political challenge,” said Dan Schnur, an adjunct professor of politics, communication and leadership.
While Newsom has proposed some cuts to schools, he has mostly committed to keeping them to a minimum. His funding cuts to the fight against climate change, transportation, housing and workforce development programs are much larger.
“To his credit, one thing Newsom has done is he’s really strong-armed the legislature over these years of budget surpluses into building a budget reserve,” Schnur said. “That’s going to help protect against the worst cuts, or against the most onerous tax increases because they’ll have reserves to draw from.”
The worry for Schnur, as well as for legislators, is that continued spending, combined with uncertainty over the future state of the country’s economy and interest rates, could create a recession that would exacerbate such problems for many of the state’s sectors.
“The biggest concern in Sacramento now is not this year’s deficit, that, while difficult, will be manageable,” Schnur said. “Their concern is if an economic downturn continues in the next year, that’s where the much more painful decisions are going to come into play.”

Known for more than his music-making creativity, Lil Yachty is a persona that everyone from rappers to rap fans have grown accustomed to loving. Yachty has been prevalent since he dropped his first mixtape titled “Lil Boat,” in 2016. Since then, Lil Yachty has mastered every flow and style. From his Detroit-influenced “Michigan Boy Boat” album to his pop-inspired project titled “Teenage Emotions,” Lil Yachty has proven he can do it all. 
With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that Lil Yachty decided to dip his toes in yet another genre of music. “Let’s Start Here.” arrived on Jan. 27, bringing 14 tracks including features from artists such as Daniel Caesar and Diana Gordon. For 57 minutes, the project forces each and every listener to tap their feet and bob their head. The beat of each track makes moving along inevitable. For this reason, and many more, “Let’s Start Here.” is proof that Lil Yachty can excel without needing to rap.  
It comes with no hesitation to say that Lil Yachty succeeded, in fact, excelled, with “Let’s Start Here.” The project itself is far from forgettable. It creates positive momentum for the rapper in this genre of psychedelic rock/alternative. The album has multiple green flags, including replayable tracks and a unique sense of production. Apart from this, Lil Yachty didn’t fail to implement his distinctive, autotune-influenced sound. 
From track one, “the BLACK seminole.” the listener gets an insight into what the entire album is going to sound like. Lil Yachty does an excellent job at almost easing his listener into his newly-created sound. From the beat drop that is immediately followed by Yachty’s autotuned voice to the chords that pair well with the track’s melody, “the BLACK seminole.” is a reference point to what new Lil Yachty sounds like. 
On track two, “the ride-,” Lil Yachty wastes no time and gets straight to the point. The song opens with a high-pitched, mellow-sounding and flute-like beat. It walks listeners through a forest at sunrise without a care in the world. Lil Yachty executes the ad-libs for this track perfectly. It’s almost as if he recorded the ad-libs and the lyrics to the song in one go with how perfectly they are paired. 
Track four presents “pRETTy”, one of the best-produced songs on the album. When you listen to this song for the first time, it makes you think of the amount of time that went into producing this work of art. It’s interesting to see how Lil Yachty used his rap experience on this track, more specifically his iconic “Poland” flow. This flow can only be characterized as chopped-up vocals amped with auto-tune. “pRETTy” really highlights the versatility that Lil Yachty has when it comes to music-making. The track’s ability to be catchy yet unique makes it special. 
“drive ME crazy!” is by far the grooviest track on the album. From the beginning, the ’70s-influenced beat grabs the listener’s attention. It almost transports you to the time of bell bottoms and afros. About one minute into the song, Lil Yachty makes his appearance. “drive ME crazy!” uses the least auto-tune on Lil Yachty’s vocals, but ironically is the most soothing because of it. 
The final track of the album, “REACH THE SUNSHINE.,” will make listeners feel as if they are at a firework show. Track 14 is the final goodbye from the album, and because of this, it seems as if Lil Yachty pulled out any and all of the tricks up his sleeve to really leave the listener blown away. Anything on this track can be mentioned and given praise, but what stands out the most is the song’s tempo. Despite almost being a six-minute song, Yachty paces it so the audience feels that it’s not long enough. Lil Yachty leaves the listener hungry for more only to realize that it’s the last song of the album. In doing so, Yachty tells his listeners, “I’ll see you later,” instead of “goodbye.” 
It takes a lot of confidence for successful rappers to step out of their comfort zone and release music in other genres. In 2022, we saw rapper Drake attempt an EDM/house music-influenced album titled “Honestly, Nevermind.” Although this album was not a fan favorite, it inspired many other rappers to step away from the “rap” label. In 2010, we saw another attempt to redefine a rap career with Lil Wayne’s rock-influenced project, “Rebirth.” Considered one of Lil Wayne’s worst projects, many would label this as a failed attempt. Those who are successful transcend the role of rappers and become artists. After “Let’s Start Here.,” it’s safe to say that Lil Yachty not only established but also proved his role as a musician and artist. 
It’s difficult to assess if this is a reset button on Lil Yachty’s image and career or if it’s simply another persona he’s created. Whatever he decides, he’s going to be successful if he keeps implementing such creativity and authenticity to his sound. Lil Yachty’s “Let’s Start Here.” leaves no room for anyone to call him a one-hit wonder or SoundCloud rapper. From now on, he ditches the role as a rapper and embodies that of a talented artist.

Have you ever overheard a couple of hockey players conversing with each other and had no clue what they were talking about? Hockey is one of the most unique sports on the planet, so it’s only fitting it would be accompanied by its own distinct vernacular. As a New England transplant who grew up around the rink, I feel as if it’s my duty to bring some puck lingo to the West Coast. The next time you find yourself in a conversation with a hockey player or avid fan and feel like you need a translator, just refer to this dictionary and you should be able to hold your own. 
“Bender”: Now this one you might be familiar with, as it’s an essential piece of hockey vocabulary. The noun refers to a player whose ankles bend when they skate. It is often accompanied by a mention of ankle tape, which is used by some players to offer a little extra support. This insult is more often used to trash talk opposing players or by teammates poking fun at one another. Hockey players’ ankles are not supposed to bend much, so it’s generally not a term you want to hear with your name attached. 
“Duster”: This is another crucial noun you need to know if you’re going to try to talk about hockey. Duster refers to players not seeing much ice time and collecting dust on the bench. Most often used amid trash-talking and friends joking around, a player who is dusty is someone who is not too skilled and therefore receives little playing time. If a hockey savant is ever teasing you, just pull this one out of your back pocket and watch them scramble for a response. 
“Yard Sale”: This phrase might not be used on the ice itself too often, but it usually comes up in an NHL broadcast every couple of days. It can be used as a noun or adjective and describes a particularly hard hit. Think of it as the hockey equivalent of a hit stick in football. Though a hit to this extent rarely occurs, a true yard sale is when a player gets checked so hard that their gloves, stick or helmet go flying and lay out on the ice like a yard sale display. 
“Beauty” or “Beautician”: Now, this is something you definitely want to be called. Beauticians are adored by teammates and fans alike. Not only is a beauty a talented player on the ice, but they also have an electric personality. They are often hilarious individuals and are usually sporting the premier “flow” (long hair flowing out of one’s helmet) on their squad. 
“Flamingo”: A flamingo denotes a very specific play that happens during the course of a game. Blocking shots is an essential part of hockey, and not just for goalies. One of the prime ways to earn respect from your teammates and coaches as a player who’s willing to do the dirty work is to step in front of a shot as a position player. When someone is in place to block a shot and lifts their leg to avoid getting hit by the puck, that is a flamingo. Aptly named for its one-legged pose, a flamingo is something your coach will call you when you get back to the bench and they’re upset you didn’t take one for the team. Don’t be a flamingo, block the shot.
“Plumber”: A plumber is in the opposite vein of a flamingo. Plumbers are not the most skilled members of the team, but are highly respected nonetheless. Plumbers, like their moniker, do all the dirty work. They go into the corners, block shots and most importantly, constantly hustle. Being called a plumber is an honor, as it’s recognition for tasks that don’t show up on the stat sheet and are largely unheralded by fans. 
Now to finish out, here are some quick hitters that don’t need as much explanation as the aforementioned vocabulary. 
“Dangle”: A dangle is a move or deke performed by a player with their stick that fakes out an opposing player or goalie.
“Filthy”: This is an adjective that denotes a particular impressive dangle, shot or play as a whole. Synonyms are “yucky,” “disgusting” and “nasty.”
“Apple”: An apple is simply an assist on another player’s goal.
“Gongshow”: This fun word is uttered when a game is out of control and there’s an abundance of goals. 
“Sieve”: Similar to a sieve or strainer used for pasta, this is a goalie who lets numerous pucks past them. 
“Gino”: Maybe the most important word on this list, a gino is a goal. Always referring to goals as ginos is an easy way to seem like you know what you’re talking about during a hockey game. 
That was a crash course in the language of hockey players everywhere. Some of it still may sound like gibberish, but the more you practice, the more you’ll see it’s a very fun dialect to speak. We’ll learn some more in future installments, but that should be enough to carry you through any hockey conversation and help you understand future editions of this column.

It could be your first day or your fifth year. Your boss approaches you and asks you to complete an arduous task that was not in your job description. The feeling of dread creeps up on you. You know this assignment will mean nothing but late nights and added stress. The pressure to please is overwhelming though, and you begrudgingly agree. 
There exists immense pressure to be a team player in the workplace. What does it mean to be a team player? Maybe it means coming in on weekends, staying late or taking on the most menial tasks with a smile. No matter the specifics, one thing is for certain: The team player never says “no.”
These expectations threaten workers’ personal time, work-life balance and wellbeing. Every employee should feel safe setting appropriate boundaries. But boundary-setting doesn’t come naturally to most of us. Saying “no” is a skill that we must practice, just like anything else. With time, it should become possible to achieve a better work-life balance and resist the urge to sacrifice time and mental health to please others.
But how do we say “no” without coming across as argumentative or difficult? “Explaining your reasoning will give you a much better chance of having your ‘no’ be well-received and agreed upon,” wrote former Forbes contributor Ashira Prossack, former Forbes contributor. “You always want to provide a sound reason, not an excuse, as to why you’re saying ‘no.’ This helps the other person see things from your point of view and respond more rationally rather than reactively.” 
As Prossack explained, you want everyone involved to agree with your decision. And before they can agree with you, they need to understand why you’re not the right person for this task. Perhaps it’s planned for a day you’re not scheduled to work, or maybe you haven’t received enough training to carry out the task. An explanation goes a long way in softening the “no” and identifying the core problem. This allows your supervisor to either amend the task (i.e. change the date to one you’re actually working on) or find someone who’s a better fit to take it on. Give your supervisor the opportunity to rectify the situation and adjust the role.
The earlier you advocate for yourself, the easier it’ll be to establish boundaries. Your employer may very well be testing your limits to see what they can get away with and how much they can add to your plate. If your reasonable and well-communicated “no” is treated with anger and refusal, it might be time to look for a new job or a department transfer.
Being an advocate takes time to learn and it’s hard to do in the moment. If you need a minute to collect yourself and formulate a reply, it’s also okay to say something along the lines of, “I’ll need to get back to you on that.” This type of reply is easier to say than an outright “no” and it helps to break the habit of a knee jerk “yes.”
Workplace culture relies heavily on the “no” stigma and that has to change. Normalize saying “yes” when it’s appropriate and “no” when it’s not. No job is entitled to your personal time or sanity.

During winter break, my dad texted me sometime in the morning that Johnny, one of my childhood dogs, had passed. Cancer was the reason, he thought. It hit me hard and in between long crying sessions, I thought about how I kept losing things that used to anchor me to the place I called home for a long time — the little reasons I had to come back. The six, seven or eight years I’ve been away have passed by quickly, and more things have changed than I’d like. 
Good dogs are gone too soon, the price of my childhood home keeps going up and the sociopolitical reality that keeps shifting rightward makes me question if I can still keep the promise I made to myself to come back to the state someday. When I fly back, which will hopefully be soon, I think I’ll also notice a big change in the green canopy that welcomes Atlanta-bound passengers — a shiny brand new police training facility sticking out like a heavily corporate-funded pig sty.
The proposed $90 million facility has already started breaking ground in a heavily forested spot in DeKalb County, on a site that has historically been a part of the Old Atlanta Prison Farm and a police shooting range and — even more historically — stolen Muscogee land. In between this piece of land’s existence as home to the Muscogee people and a shooting range, it was a plantation and then a prison farm. The history behind this forest is written in blood and violence, but the trees and foliage that grow here are an important part of the ecosystem.
This area, known now as the South River Forest, was designated as one of four “city lungs” for its importance and environmental impact as one of the largest urban forests in the Southeast. At a time when the effects of climate change become more and more apparent, environmental advocacy groups warn that fragmenting the forest could also make the area more prone to flooding, which would disproportionately impact the communities of color in the surrounding area. To that end, the Atlanta Police Foundation said it’d plant trees to replace any hardwood trees that would be torn down in a Q&A form revised Sept. 19. 
It took the incredibly unfortunate slaying of 26-year-old Manuel Teran, otherwise known as Tortuguita, a burned police car and the destruction of the buildings of some of the financial backers of the Atlanta Police Foundation — the primary force behind Cop City’s existence — for the local protest to make international headlines. And that, the part about financial backers, is why this fight is so important. Perhaps more important than any other police training ground project, the Atlanta Police Foundation and a good chunk of money funding the construction of Cop City comes from outside of Georgia — including Amazon. This is not a condemnation of anyone who buys from Amazon, uses a Wells Fargo bank account, flies on Delta Airlines or shops at Home Depot. Far from it. 
In this age of information, we’re sinking in a tidal wave of it. I would just hope “I Reckon” readers are reminded that the web spun between corporations with deep, deep pockets and the most horrible building projects known to man is surprisingly small. 
There will always be rumblings about destruction and violence during times like these — “What about nonviolence!” they’ll say. I’d argue it’s hard to imagine how much more local residents could have done to clearly communicate with their political leaders. This is especially true when they repeatedly and overwhelmingly vocalized their opposition to the project with both the city council and the police foundation — the former of which residents have no clear representation on, and the latter of which didn’t even include a public comment section. 
I don’t know what the future of policing or public safety looks like. I’m still early into my own reckoning of what the future looks like when and if the police will be abolished. But there’s one thing I do know, which is that the future shouldn’t look like what’s going on in the South River Forest. The future should not look like further militarization of police in what is already one of the most surveilled cities in the nation. “Public safety” and protection are not on the minds of the bankrollers of Cop City. It is the militant protection of property — their monetary assets — that they want to get. Come hell or high water, I hope they never get it.

If there was ever a reason to resist the urge to order from the McDonald’s late-night menu, a new study from Keck Medicine of USC and the Keck School of Medicine, revealing the detrimental effect of fast food consumption on livers, may provide just that.
The study, published earlier this month in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, found that eating fast food — defined in the study as meals obtained from either a drive-through restaurant or one without wait staff — is associated to an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which excessive fat builds up in the liver and can contribute to significantly increased mortality.
The study also found that people suffering from obesity or diabetes who consume 20% or more of their daily calories from fast food have severely elevated fat levels in their livers, compared to those who consume little to no fast food. The general population who obtain more than a fifth of their energy intake from fast food has also seen a moderate increase in liver fat versus those who do not consume as much.
While prior research in the field established a link between fast food consumption and diabetes or obesity, this study is one of the first to explore fast food’s negative effect on liver health, said Ani Kardashian, hepatologist with Keck Medicine of USC, assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and the lead author of the study.
“We wanted to see if we could show and link fast food consumption to a higher risk of having fat build up in the liver,” Kardashian said. “What was surprising to me is how many people are eating fast food and how many people are eating over … a fifth of their calories from fast food.”
Kardashian and her colleagues analyzed the most recent data provided in the 2017-18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the largest annual survey in the country, to explore the impact of fast food on liver health.
Specifically, Kardashian and her colleagues analyzed the fatty liver measurement from approximately 4,000 adults in the survey and compared that to their fast food consumption histories.
Among those surveyed, 52% of them had consumed fast food within 48 hours before taking the survey, and 29% of those who had fast food experienced a significant rise in their liver fat levels, as they consumed one-fifth or more daily calories from fast food.
Moreover, researchers surmounted the challenge of readjusting the data with multifarious factors and discovered that the higher risk of NAFLD brought by 20% of daily caloric intake is applicable to both the general population and those with obesity and diabetes.
“We use data that’s already available in the dataset on age, gender, race, ethnicity, physical activity and income. Then what we did was we created a model where we looked at the relationship between fast food, or more than one fifth of the calories from fast food with the outcome of fatty liver,” Kardashian said. “And in that model, we controlled for all these other variables. So we accounted for the influence of all these other variables in the model.”
It was particularly challenging yet fulfilling for researchers to figure out which factors or variables are appropriate to be included in the study, said Jennifer Dodge, co-author of the study and assistant professor of research medicine and population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine.
“When we got to the phase of the study where we were looking at fast food and its association with liver fat after adjusting for things that may be confounders, like consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol intake or physical activity,” Dodge said. “That’s where it’s really interesting so that you can see the whole picture.”
The detrimental effect of fast foods on liver health is extremely alarming to researchers, as fast food consumption has grown exponentially in the past 50 years, especially during the coronavirus pandemic.  
“Fast food is cheap, and it’s easy to access. It’s at every street corner,” Kardashian said. “We are also seeing that … it is more expensive to buy healthier foods. And so as much as we can do as doctors to counsel our patients of the negative health effects of fast foods, we also need larger policy changes that make it easier for people of all incomes to be able to afford healthy foods.”
Whole foods, which are less heavily processed, could be a litmus test for finding healthier food options and safeguarding liver health, said Carin Kreutzer, instructional professor of clinical gerontology and pediatrics at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.
“The elephant in the room is ultra-processed foods. And fast foods are ultra-processed. The study that looked at the consumption of ultra-processed foods, which includes fast foods … finds that as much as 10% of all premature deaths in individuals, ages 30 to 69, were due to overconsumption of fast foods,” said Kreutzer, referring to the study that studied 57,000 individuals in Brazil. “In terms of food, it is looking for healthier choices when you are eating out and we are seeing more and more of that where you can go to a place where they do have whole foods, where it’s not heavily processed.”
Kardashian hoped that the study could encourage healthcare providers to offer patients more nutrition education, especially those with obesity or diabetes, who are at a higher risk of developing fatty liver from fast food consumption.
“Ultimately, the message here is that the healthier you eat, and the better foods you put into your body, the better your liver’s going to be,” Kardashian said.
Correction: This article was updated Jan. 30 at 2:58 p.m. to reflect that Keck Medicine of USC and the Keck School of Medicine, which are separate institutions, jointly contributed to this study. Kardashian is a hepatologist with Keck Medicine as well as an assistant professor at the Keck School of Medicine. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Seven Trojans competed in singles, doubles and mixed doubles at the Australian Open this year. Six alumni played in the main draw, but the newest Trojan, freshman Learner Tien, dominated the junior draw. Tien, who will join USC this spring, was the singles runner-up and the doubles champion in the prestigious junior tournament. Here are the former and current USC players who played in the 2023 Australian Open and their results. 
Brandon Holt — Men’s Singles
This Australian Open was Holt’s second appearance in a Grand Slam main draw. In the first qualifying round, Holt beat Radu Albot, the third-ranked seed in the qualifiers draw. Holt then dominated his opponent in the second qualifying round, winning in two sets with scores of 6-3, 6-0. Holt also won the third and final qualifying round in two straight sets, which advanced him into the main draw. 
In the round of 128, Holt beat Aleksandar Vukic in a five-set match. Holt then faced No. 25-ranked Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut. Holt was up at the beginning of the match and won the first two sets 6-4, 6-2, but he lost the following three sets and was eliminated from the tournament. 
Learner Tien — Junior Men’s Singles and Doubles
17-year-old Tien will start playing for the men’s tennis team this spring. His play was exceptional in the Junior Championships, where he made the finals in both singles and doubles. In singles, Tien coasted through the first three rounds. He then beat No. 2 seed Iliyan Radulov 6-0, 6-0 in the quarterfinals and Tomasz Berkieta in the semifinals. Tien then played in the finals against No. 3 seed Alexander Blockx, but lost after forcing a third set.
However, Tien and his partner Cooper Williams won the doubles finals as the No. 7 seeded team. They dominated throughout the tournament and beat the No. 1 seeded team in the finals 6-4, 6-4. 
Kaitlyn Christian — Women’s Doubles 
Christian graduated from USC in 2014 and has a WTA doubles ranking of 65. She played doubles with Montenegrin tennis player Danka Kovinić at the Australian Open. However, the pair did not make it past the first round. 
Christian and Kovinić were tied with their opponents at 6 in the first set, but then lost the tiebreak 7-2. They went on to lose the second set 6-2, allowing Miyu Kato and Aldila Sutjiadi to advance to the round of 64. 
Yannick Hanfmann — Men’s Singles
Hanfmann, part of the class of 2015, dominated in the men’s singles qualifying rounds. He beat Maximilian Marterer in the first qualifying round with a 6-4 walkover. Hanfmann then swept his opponent away in the second qualifying round 6-2, 6-2. He faced some challenges in the first set of the third qualifying round, after losing the set tiebreak against Facundo Diaz Acosta. However, Hanfmann rebounded and won the following two sets, advancing him to the main draw. 
Although he lost, Hanfmann played a lively 5-set match against Australian and eventual men’s doubles champion Rinky Hijikata in the round of 128. Hanfmann won the first two sets 6-4, 6-4, but Hijikata began his comeback by winning the third set. Hanfmann persevered and tied the fourth set at six games, but lost the intense tiebreak 7-5. He then lost the final set 6-3, which eliminated him from the tournament. 
Angela Kulikov — Women’s Doubles 
Kulikov has a WTA doubles ranking of 58 and played with Sophie Chang this Australian Open. They played a competitive game against their opponents in the first set and were tied at four all, but eventually lost the set 6-4. Kulikov and Chang, however, did not play as close of a game in the second set and ended up losing the first round match.
Robert Farah — Men’s Doubles 
Farah, currently ranked No. 27 in the world for doubles, paired with Juan Sebastián Cabal as the No. 12 seed. Farah had high chances going into this tournament as a two-time doubles Grand Slam champion. He also won the U.S. Open and Wimbledon finals in 2019. He only made it to the third round of this year’s Australian Open, but still had some eventful matches. 
Farah and Cabal had a close 6-8 tiebreak in the second set of the first round, but they pulled through and won the match. The pair also had a significant comeback in the second round and won the final two sets 6-3, 6-1 after losing the first set 6-4. However, Frenchmen Benjamin Bonzi and Arthur Rinderknech fought to win the third round match. The first two sets had close tiebreaks, but the French players won in the end, saying goodbye to Farah and Cabal. 
Giuliana Olmos — Women’s Doubles and Mixed Doubles
Olmos, currently ranked No. 8 in the world for doubles, was busy playing women’s and mixed doubles in this Grand Slam. She made it to the third round of women’s doubles with her partner Anna Kalinskaya. Olmos and Kalinskaya swept through the early matches in the first two rounds. However, their luck ran out in the third round, as the duo lost against the No. 3 seeds. 
In the mixed doubles event, Olmos played with Marcelo Arévalo and made it to the second round. Both teams played competitively and ended up with split sets, but Olmos and Arévalo persevered and won the 10-point tiebreak 10-6. Their second round match against David Vega Hernández and 2017 Roland Garros singles champion Jeļena Ostapenko was full of excitement. Olmos and Arévalo won the first set in a 7-4 tiebreak but lost the second set in an 8-6 tiebreak. At one set each, Hernández and Ostapenko pulled through and won the 10-point tiebreak 10-6.
