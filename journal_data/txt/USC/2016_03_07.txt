Approximately 20 students gathered in Hahn Plaza Monday afternoon to hold a rally and sit-in at Bovard Auditorium advocating for a tuition freeze after multiple attempts to voice their concerns to administrators resulted in failure. The rally came just days after a screenshot went viral exposing a nearly $2,000 increase in tuition in the coming year.
When protesters arrived in Bovard for the sit-in, they had a heated dialogue with Tim Bessolo, associate vice provost for Student Affairs who guarded the door. They were frustrated that their demands could not get through to those in charge, so they resorted to sitting in Bovard for four hours. DPS locked down Bovard, took down the internet so students could not post on social media and did not allow protesters to use the bathrooms with the hopes that they would eventually leave.
Bessolo responded to students wanting to see President C. L. Max Nikias by repeating the fact that Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs, had office hours on Thursday. He made sure that students could not enter Nikias’ office.
“[Ainsley Carry] works directly with the provost, who oversees a large majority of the areas, so they’ll bring those concerns to him,” Bessolo said. “We’ll stay as long as students want to stay … till the building closes.”
Protesters felt that the only way to get the attention of administrators was through an organized demonstration. Those in attendance said they came to have their voices heard as to why they advocate for a tuition freeze.
“We’ve tried diplomatic routes, we passed a student government resolution and the administration hasn’t listened to us,” said Tessa Meurer, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “Direct action works, so we have to use this route unless they listen.”
The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution to freeze tuition in November, but it was not implemented by the university administration. Victor Sherman, a senior majoring in environmental studies said that although the amount tuition is increasing doesn’t sound like a lot on its own he’s going to be having issues paying his tuition off.
“$3,000 [sic] is a lot of money, and just ‘cause we already have a huge tuition it’s not a large percentage but it’s a lot of money,” Sherman said. “I don’t make that much a year in my part-time job.”
Provost Michael Quick said that tuition increases are at a historic low in a statement regarding the tuition increase on March 3.
“Tuition increases at USC using 5-year averages are at their lowest in 50 years — over the last five years tuition has increased an average of 4% annually,” Quick said.
The event was organized through Facebook, and more than 400 people indicated that they were going.
“We have various student organizers who put this rally together because they felt that an increase was really unjustified given that we were in conversation with the University about tuition and we weren’t notified,” said USG President Rini Sampath, one of the authors of the tuition freeze resolution. “We are doing fundraising, we have University students who can’t afford this increase if it is $2,000 per year.”
Many came to show support for students who could no longer afford their education.
“I’m just showing up to support. I saw it on the Facebook group, and I agree that the tuition hike is ridiculous. I think that we can show solidarity in numbers and that you can’t keep ignoring the student voice,” said Emily New, a freshman majoring in English.
Event organizer and Director of Diversity Affairs Moira Turner opened the event by riling up protestors to a common cause.
“We are charged the price of having to go to school here,” Turner said. “Education is a right, not a privilege. Join with me to tell Nikias and the trustees and all others that have decided to raise tuition without consulting the student body that we will not stand for tuition hikes.”
They chanted various phrases from “Hey, Hey, ho, ho tuition hikes have got to go,” to “Nikias, step off it” at a group of cameras and reporters. The Department of Public Safety stood around the students and observed.
Once protesters had garnered attention from onlookers they began to share personal stories. Organizers stressed that personal stories could change administrators’ opinions more than numbers.
There were similarities between these personal anecdotes. Many of the students said they worked multiple jobs, taken on student debt to avoid dropping out and skipped meals in order to keep up on tuition. They were worried about how to pay for all of their extraneous expenses, like books and housing.
Some had prepared speeches beforehand while others volunteered themselves after hearing about the plights of fellow students. Thirteen protesters shared personal stories and noted the cyclical nature of higher education, where many students work late and have less time to study and thus are rejected from scholarships because their grade point average decreases.
Following the student organized rally and sit-in at Bovard, a town hall forum was held at the United University Church to recap the events of the day for those who were unable to make the main event.

Former USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett died on Sunday, a month after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Garrett, 52, was serving as the president of Cornell University, the first female to ever hold that position.
After announcing her diagnosis in early February, Garrett began intensive treatment at Weill Cornell Medicine and was released following surgery on Feb. 19. She died at her home on Sunday night, less than one year after starting her new role at Cornell.
Previously, Garrett served as the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at USC for five years, assuming her role in 2010. Before becoming provost, she served as a professor for seven years and was named the Frances R. and John J. Duggan professor of law, political science, finance and business economics and public policy.
“Beth served on my senior leadership team for over a decade, and proved herself to be a remarkably dynamic leader with a singular gift for inspired, innovative thinking,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “So many of us recall her remarkable energy, her tenacious commitment to her work, and her deep passion for our community.”
In her role at USC, Garrett recruited administrators, expanded the strength and diversity of undergraduate classes, and expanded the University’s residential and online professional master’s degrees. She also played a key role in expanding the University’s postdoctoral programs and programming new academic buildings.
Outside of her administrative duties, Garrett was a dedicated professor and researcher of law. The author of more than 50 articles, book chapters and essays, she studied legislative processes, the design of democratic institutions and the federal budget process and tax policy. She was also the co-author of what is considered to be the most influential casebook on legislation and statutory interpretation. Her work, both administrative and academic, left a considerable impact on the Trojan community, according to Nikias and fellow administrators.
“Beth’s legacy at the University of Southern California is both exceptional and assured,” Nikias said. “Beth worked tirelessly on our behalf, and her accomplishments will continue to benefit the Trojan Family for generations, as we watch our faculty produce even more transformative work, and as our students achieve even greater successes around the world. Many of these contributions will have their roots in Beth’s stellar leadership, and for this we should all be grateful.”

The USC Political Student Assembly hosted an open discussion about education policy in the United States on Monday as part of USC Academic Culture Assembly’s EdMonth. The fuel for the discussion was the Common Core State Standards initiative, a system designed to promote consistent and quality education across state lines through standardized goals and expectations for students in English language arts, literacy and mathematics.
“Instead of whatever standardized tests you had previously, this is a new way of standardized tests for grade schools. It’s a new way of teaching, a new way of evaluating student’s progress throughout grade school,” said Jenny Di, director of the Political Student Assembly.
Common Core has sparked a great deal of controversy. Some say that the standards could provide a stable nationwide benchmark that will help the United States compete with international education standards, whereas others say that the initiative imposes too many regulations and restricts education professionals from customizing their curriculums in meaningful ways.
Di and Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, assistant director of the Academic Culture Assembly, moderated the discussion. The goal of the discussion was both to inform students of and to evaluate Common Core as a new system for assessing the nation’s educational system.
“There’s no real objective about which side is more right, it’s just a roundtable discussion on the pros and cons of the system, the opinions of students, and possibly better solutions or the benefits of Common Core in our education system,” Vidalon-Suzuki said.
The roundtable discussions found positive and negatives aspects of Common Core.
Some people raised the concern that Common Core would not allow teachers enough control over their curriculum at the local level. Other people criticized the English language arts and literacy section for being too rigid so that it might limit students’ creativity and free-thinking.
Many agreed that the initiative would be a very useful way to maintain consistent, quality standards for education nationwide, arguing that this consistency would have a very positive outcome for students.
“One benefit is that if a student moves from one state to another, then the curriculum will be more or less the same because they have the same Common Core standards,” Vidalon-Suzuki said.
Many comments addressed the mathematics portion of the Common Core standards, as it creates an entirely new model for teaching basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with an emphasis on grasping the concepts underlying these operations rather than repeating the same techniques.
Take for example the mathematics section, which teaches students to approach subtraction by visualizing the distance between two numbers. In addition to the traditional borrowing method, the Common Core incorporates a number line and hierarchy method to provide children ways to learn a fundamental operation.
Policy makers have recently been challenged to improve education in the United States to meet international standards.
“One big problem that we have is that we focus more on top down policy when we should be focusing on students and teachers and their viewpoints, because nobody knows what’s best for a community than the community themselves,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “What we see right now is that we have policy makers and people who maybe have never attended a public school making these decisions, and they don’t have a direct understanding of what impact  their decisions have.”

Faith. Family. Football.
That is the motto of USC’s team, promoted strongly by their leader, head coach Clay Helton. Helton assumed the head-coaching role two days after the Trojans’ convincing 40-21 win over UCLA on Nov. 28.
The motto has since been embraced by the team and is emblazoned on black hoodies that can frequently be seen around campus.
Helton said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that selling kids on the team’s motto is one of his biggest recruiting tools.
The words that Helton now lives by were taught to him by the same man who gave him his start as a coach: his father, Kim Helton.
“My dad taught me there’s not a lot of time out there to be able to do other things, so concern yourself with three things: Faith, family and football, and that’s what I believe in,” Helton said.
His coaching career began immediately following graduation. Helton spent two years at Duke, one as a graduate assistant and one as the running backs coach in 1996 but then moved to his alma mater and the school his father coached at — University of Houston, where he was the running backs coach for three seasons.
“It’s not too many times you get to work for your best friend in life and your hero and that’s what my dad is to me,” Helton said. “I’ve learned so many lessons from him, not only as a young guy, but as a coach, and now as a guy that’s 43 years old.”
Faith
Religion is a big part of the football culture at USC, and it can be witnessed every time the team runs out of the Coliseum on Saturday. They all head for the end zone where many players take a knee and take a moment to pray.
Religion is in the locker room, on the field and in tattoos.
“We believe that no matter what religion you believe in, if you want to practice your faith, practice your faith and we support you,” Helton said.
Family
The two-faced second moniker holds especially true for Helton, whose coaching career has been so intricately tied to his family. Getting a start from his father gave Helton the opportunity to develop not just his knowledge of Xs and Os, but develop his character as well.
“He’s taught me how to be a husband, a father, a football coach and a leader of men,” Helton said of his father. “I’m very blessed to have a guy that isn’t only my best friend but also happens to be a really good football coach too.”
Helton said he still talks to his dad two or three times a week.
Helton’s parents live in Florida acting as caretakers for his grandmother, who is in her 90s. They take an annual trip to visit their son’s colleges though, and now that Helton has hired on his brother, Tyson Helton, as quarterbacks and passing game coordinator, Helton is hoping that his parents will be able to spend more time in California.
Tyson Helton also played for his father at Houston before becoming the special teams coach at Hawaii. Most recently, he was the offensive coordinator at Western Kentucky.
“I’ve always known how talented a coach he is, but now to see it up close and personal is great,” Helton said. “To bring that dynamic to your football team, not only a guy that you love, but also an ultra-talented coach it makes you very proud as a head coach. I’m mad that he has more hair than me, and he’s a lot skinnier than me.”
Helton has been able to surround himself with those he loves, no one more than his high school sweetheart, Angela Helton. Helton and his wife have quite the love story.
Though Helton says he no longer looks the part, he was once the quarterback at Clements High in Sugar Land, Texas. Angela Helton was a member of the dance team that performed at the games.
“I’ve been in love since I was 15, she figured it out at 17, and we’ve been in love ever since,” Helton said.
Going into their 21st year of marriage, the Heltons have three kids of their own, including high school senior, Reid Helton, who is looking at USC as a possible college for next year.
Football
As spring football begins, Helton has his hands full implementing new concepts as well as incorporating freshman onto the team in what he expects to be a competition-filled spring season.
“The beauty of spring ball is competition, and that’s where you establish yourself,” Helton said.  “Over the past six years, we’ve had 15 freshman All-Americans, so here it’s about stepping on that practice field and competing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a freshman or a senior.”
Spring isn’t just about football though. Helton said the program tries to get the players together as much as possible to promote the family-to-football tie.
“We believe in the family aspect of things and the brotherhood, and to have that you’ve got to be together,” Helton said.
Helton cited bowling and movies as two team favorites as well as Friday night dinners at local restaurants on road games during the season.
In his first full season as head coach, Helton has a lot to juggle between deciding starting lineups, preparing for a full schedule of tough opponents and keeping off-the-field drama to a minimum. For him though, it’s much simpler than that when you are able to focus on the things that matter most: Faith. Family. Football.

This past week, USC released its official spring football practice schedule that includes 14 practices in the months of March and April. The practices, all open to the public, will be in preparation of the spring football game on Saturday, April 16, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Tuesday’s practice marks the first of the off-season and the first spring practice under new head coach Clay Helton and his revamped coaching staff. The workout will feature many returning starters from last season, including sophomore running back Ronald Jones II, junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and sophomore cornerback Iman Marshall. In total, nine offensive and six defensive starters will be returning in 2016 to go along with the returning reserves and a whole bevy of recruits.
February’s National Signing Day brought in 13 recruits for the Trojans with a majority on the offensive side of the ball. Of the 20 recruits, defensive back Jack Jones and safety Jamel Cook could make a difference from USC’s defense this season.
Of those that the Trojans newest recruits will try and replace are quarterback Cody Kessler, fullbacks Jahleel Pinner and Soma Vainuku, place kicker Alex Wood, punter Kris Albarado and most of the defensive line.
Place kicker Matt Boermeester and Australian punter Chris Tilbey are the best options to be the replacements for Alex Wood and Albarado on special teams. Replacing Kessler, Pinner and Vainuku, may be a tad bit more complicated.
While the new recruits will not be able to practice until their respective senior years in high school are over, Helton is excited about the defensive additions to his roster and the competition it brings.
“I thought it was key for us to get pass rushers … Each has a special dynamic of putting pressure on quarterbacks,” Helton said. “You never have a crystal ball, but something special here at USC is that every position is an open competition. Older guys know when you come in as a freshman, you’re going to compete and the best guy is going to play.”
Of those “older guys” who could be featured during Tuesday’s practice, some of the most questionable will be on the defensive line, which lost key figures in Antwaun Woods, Delvon Simmons, Claude Pelon, Greg Townsend Jr. and Cody Temple. In their place will be fifth-year senior Jordan Simmons, fourth-year junior Kenny Bigelow Jr., third-year sophomore Malik Dorton, sophomores Jacob Daniel, Noah Jefferson and Rasheem Green and redshirt freshmen Christian Rector and Kevin Scott.
In terms of the linebacking corps, the Men of Troy lost Su’a Cravens, Anthony Sarao and Lamar Dawson, giving Cameron Smith, Olajuwon Tucker and the rest of the young defenders an opportunity to make a difference in the secondary.
With quarterback Cody Kessler departing, a new quarterback competition has emerged between Max Browne, Matt Fink, Sam Darnold and Jalen Greene.
Of the three, Browne is projected by many to win the starting role considering his three years of experience behind Kessler and support from Helton.
“One of the places we’ve got a great one is at quarterback, with a guy who’s waited in the wing three years and trained under Cody Kessler, who was a highly touted recruit coming in, and three young guys who are right behind him,” Helton said. “I’m looking forward to seeing what happens.”
Darnold, however, has a good chance to steal the starting job away from Browne, as Darnold is an accomplished dual-threat quarterback who can throw with accuracy, while adding an extra dimension to the Trojan offense with his quick feet.
Regardless of the uncertainty which the defensive line and quarterback situations may bring, Helton is optimistic in his talented team and the ability of his coaching staff to create great players.
“I am looking forward to entering the 2016 season as a new coach not only with a roster of talented players with whom I already have a relationship but with a coaching staff that I believe is exceptional,” Helton said in a press release. “We want to run the ball on offense, stop the run defensively, play great special teams and not turn over the ball. However, there is a lot of development that must be done before the 2016 season, and it starts with our time in spring practice and fall camp. I have no doubt that this staff will prepare our players well for the upcoming season.”
Spring practice kicks off Tuesday at 3:30 p.m.

The women’s lacrosse team is on a roll.
While the high-flying offense has put up 63 goals in just four games, the defense has been equally impressive. The defensive unit’s organization is tremendous. Their sticks and feet are active, and they suffocate opponents with organization and speed.
While scoring goals is enjoyable for obvious reasons, there is something especially inspiring about lockdown defense. What is remarkable here is that the team has only played four games, and the defense looks ready for the postseason. The No. 11 Women of Troy have yet to give up double-digit goals in a game, and they refuse to lose their shape as games wear on. The team checks in at No. 1 in the country in scoring defense and is the only team in the land conceding fewer than five goals per game.
Senior Courtney Tarleton complements junior defender Nina Kelty at the back, and with plenty of capable reinforcements, the depth on defense ought to make USC fans optimistic that this kind of defensive dominance will continue as the season progresses.
The USC women’s lacrosse program is just four years old, yet this team has firmly established itself as a national title contender.
It is early March. It is not prudent to jump to conclusions. But this team dismantled Michigan in every phase of the game on Friday at McAlister Field. It then proceeded to dominate Vermont on Saturday. It is safe to say that this group will challenge any team in its path in its quest for a national championship.
A natty for any team in any sport obviously brings a great deal of pride to a university. However, if the USC women’s lacrosse team continues to play at this level and comes close to winning it all — let alone actually doing it — this will go down as one of the most incredible success stories in the history of intercollegiate athletics.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael leads the entire NCAA with 4.5 goals per game. The real luxury for head coach Lindsey Munday, though, is that this offense is far deeper than just Michael. When Duke was forced to try to bottle up the sniper, junior attacker Kylie Drexel exploded for four goals. Against Michigan, Michael finished with five goals, showing superb movement off the ball and consistently getting into dangerous areas. Caroline deLyra finished the game with five assists, as the senior attacker created for her teammates time and time again.
One would be hard-pressed to find faults with this team. From sophomore goaltender Gussie Johns’ stout play between the pipes to Michael’s prolific goal scoring, glaring weaknesses simply are not present.

The men’s basketball team landed several players on the Pac-12 honors lists for the 2015-2016 season.
Junior guard Julian Jacobs was named to Pac-12 All-Conference First Team, while sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin earned a spot on the honorable mention All-Conference list, and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright also received an All-Freshman honorable mention.
The versatile Jacobs is the first Trojan to be selected for the All-Conference First Team since Nikola Vucevic in 2011. Averaging 11.6 points, 5.4 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game, Jacobs has posted three double-doubles, is first in the conference in assists per game and ranks 10th in steals.
McLaughlin leads the team in scoring, averaging nearly 13 points a game and shooting more than 42 percent from 3-point range. He made the All-Freshman team last season and has bounced back from offseason shoulder surgery for a successful sophomore campaign.
Boatwright has shown promise as one of two high-profile freshman on the team this season. He averaged double-digits at 11.4 points and his outside shooting is valuable as 6-foot-10, 220-pound big man. Boatwright made 52 3-pointers during the regular season, placing him in the top-five all-time for USC freshmen.
All three players will play a key role if the Trojans are to make a deep run in the Pac-12 tournament, which begins Wednesday night against UCLA.

Last month, I penned a column criticizing the University for its failure to address the dangerous consequences of not enforcing its own rules in regards to underage drinking. Not only have such policies been frequently made in name only, but their lack of enforcement has led to repeated incidents of unsafe drinking resulting in the serious — sometimes even fatal — injury of students.
But last week, in an attempt to address this issue, the University administration updated policies aimed at providing a clearer, more comprehensive code governing University-sanctioned greek parties and outlining both old and new regulations. As well-intentioned as this new formatting may be, the latest set of expectations appear to be just as, if not more, difficult to enforce than their predecessors.
In compliance with University regulations, fraternities and sororities must now adhere to new policies relating to attendance, security and access to alcohol. Among the new rules includes submitting for review a mandatory guest list for all attendees 24 hours prior to the event (though previous guest lists were only subject to male attendees), hiring one security guard for every 50 anticipated guests, as well as limiting all social events in which alcohol is served to Thursday until midnight and Friday through Saturday until 2 a.m. The new rules also prohibit greek organizations from advertising their events publicly as they have traditionally done using Facebook event pages, fliers, sidewalk chalk or banner displays.
Additionally, no attendees will be permitted beyond the public areas of any greek chapter in which a party is being thrown, “if either the visitor or any host of that visitor [has] consumed more than two standard-sized drinks in the preceding four-hour period.”
According to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, the latest set of guidelines were developed with the goal of meeting the University’s health, wellness and safety needs. And while these new rules do well to demonstrate the University’s willingness to more strictly define how University-sanctioned parties operate, they fail to address how such measures will be enforced in the first place — particularly given how difficult it has been to enforce similar measures in the past.
According to Interfraternity Council Executive Vice President to Administrative Affairs Peter Roberson, the goal of this updated guide wasn’t to change rules — ones which he said “haven’t really changed that much” — but rather to strengthen existing rules and highlight those that have been largely forgotten. But if the University truly seeks to ensure that the parties it authorizes are safe for all students, then it must do more than simply instate rules which will go unenforced, or worse, forgotten. Presently, regulations requiring security presence at parties haven’t prevented underage students from being served alcohol. And though an increase in party security may address this issue, it certainly won’t aid in implementing the seemingly unenforceable rule that all party attendees remain inside the party if they have consumed more than two standard-sized drinks within four hours.
Just because these policies may appear difficult to enforce, however, doesn’t mean the university shouldn’t do anything at all. To the contrary, the University has a responsibility to ensure that the parties it endorses are actually safe for students — a University-sanctioned event has to mean something more than just an official, but seemingly meaningless, label.
The tired arguments that underage drinking will continue regardless of policy or that the University’s stricter standards will harm the greek system have been heard time and again. The frequent insistence that such risky behavior has occurred without consequence before, while disregarding the few serious incidents of injury and even death, is erroneous at best and irresponsibly negligent at worst. And while it’s certainly true that the University can’t stop underaged students from drinking around University Park Campus, that doesn’t warrant turning a blind eye to it, especially when the University itself is liable for the damage such parties may cause.
But just as the University has a responsibility to ensure that its parties are safe for students, it further necessitates that the rules and policies it employs are capable of being meaningfully enforced. Though the effectiveness of these policies are still yet to be seen, it’s certain that their success will be contingent upon the University’s genuine efforts to enforce them.

The conversation regarding the coddling of American college students remains ongoing, but if this phenomenon does exist, then University administrators are actively encouraging it. With a new 11-page list of policies for greek events, USC seems intent to further its war not only against greek life in particular, but also against student choice, liberty and self-reliance in general.
The guidelines, obtained by Campus Reform and confirmed by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership, codifies the worst critiques about greek life into campus law. For instance, the new rules forbid houses from advertising their events online and they mandate the submission of a comprehensive guest list to Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development at least 24 hours before parties and a final guest list stating who actually showed up within 48 hours after the end of each party. Furthermore, greek institutions cannot advertise their parties on Facebook or on campus, rendering them effectively invite-only.
These stipulations are a 90-degree turn from the current precedent for admission to frat parties, in which all women, regardless of greek or non-greek affiliation or appearance, are granted free admission and only men are put on a list. Now, not only are frat parties encouraged to be more exclusive, paving the way for the possibility of discrimination, but the University will also have a record of not only which parties students are invited to, but also which they attend.
Other guidelines include requiring one security guard for every 50 guests and clearing performance artists with the Department of Public Safety five weeks in advance. Some of the rules are simply restatements of already existing rules, such as the ban of hard alcohol in fraternity and sorority houses. However, on the whole, the rules are a part of the University’s greater plan, to cut off the lifeblood of Greek life: its ability to host social events.
These guidelines are just one step of many of the University’s attempts to implement social control on legal adults. The actions imply that the University does not trust or respect students’ rights to choose when and how they socialize, strangely discriminating against only social chapters of the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils. For example, the Academic and Graduate Student Senates called for deferred greek recruitment last semester; however, a unanimous vote in favor of a resolution against deferring greek rush delayed these efforts. Yet somehow, these measures said to be imposed for the well-being and safety of all students ignore the majority of student life.
Only 20 percent of undergraduate women are in sororities and about 25 percent of undergraduate men are in fraternities. Though frat parties do set the tone for a large portion of USC’s famous party scene, they hardly comprise the majority. Dozens of parties with hundreds of people in attendance are held every weekend in houses on Menlo. Even more are held throughout University Park, and none of these parties have a list of rules the size of a Sturm und Drang novella to follow. For nearly all other non-greek parties, you can simply enter for $5 or for free, have unregulated access to alcohol, and avoid security guards.
I do not bring up these other parties to point fingers and say that these other parties should be regulated with the condescension and little regard for individual liberty that USC’s frat parties are. Instead, I mean that DPS’ control of noise complaints and rowdiness on Menlo and other non-greek University Park parties has worked so far, so USC should let go of its vendetta and place a little more faith in its admissions team and moreover, its students.

House of Cards has always been known for its incredible acting across its large cast of actors and actresses, which is only strengthened by the riveting writing — from the lines that send shivers down the spines of viewers to the looks that convey a novel’s worth of words. This season is no different, as Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly and other favorites from past seasons bring their A-game in a season full of paranoia, corruption and malice.
Newcomers Neve Campbell, a capable campaign manager assisting both Frank (Spacey) and Claire (Wright), and Joel Kinnaman, who plays the abhorrent Republican presidential nominee, are excellent additions to the cast and fit perfectly into the dark world of politics.
While the intentions, actions and words of the characters are more than enough to show how twisted the world they’re a part of is, the cinematography also beautifully displays, quite literally, how dark it is. Each shot, carefully planned, is hauntingly gorgeous and serves as a constant reminder of just how morally corrupt the majority of the characters are in-show, with their hearts devoid of light. Frank and Claire have never looked more intimidating on screen, and their complicated relationship is masterfully portrayed through the bleak visuals.
It may be complicated, but it certainly makes for good television, and Claire and Frank’s relationship is the main drive of this season. If last season was a demonstration of how the two fall when divided, this season shows that they stand tall when united. Viewers are treated to further characterization of Claire, who proves that the president is nothing without his first lady. The first half of the season is a power struggle between Frank and Claire before they come together to secure another term for Frank as president and spot for Claire on his ticket as vice president. Wright does an excellent job of playing a character that commands attention through fear while also giving reason to sympathize with and respect her. While she was arguably weakened as a character in the last season, she reminds viewers this season that she’s just as conniving as they come, especially highlighted during her time as the devil on the vice president’s shoulder that did her every bidding. In fact, it could be argued that this season is more Claire-centric than it is Frank-centric, and it’s all the better for it. Every meticulous detail in the game to gain more power is methodically planned out in her head, proving that she’s the backbone of their hellish dream team.
The only drawback to this season is how sporadic it feels at times. The first half of the season focuses on Frank reuniting with Claire and ending the schism between the two, while the second half of the season focuses on Frank and Claire becoming an unstoppable president and vice president team while overcoming the Republican presidential nominee, who is introduced out of nowhere.
Though it does wrap things up from last season’s stinger and leave room for the already green-lit fifth season to grow, both plot points feel rushed at times. Trailers hinted at this entire season being about the vicious war between Frank and Claire, but the new season almost feels like a preface to what lies ahead.
Still, it’s not enough to derail the wild ride that this season is. This season accelerates at full throttle and refuses to ease off at any time. Viewers who missed the moments that left their jaws agape with astonishment at the depths Frank, Claire, Doug and others would stoop to have nothing to worry about this season. The moments that make viewers turn their heads in disgust but shamefully press play on the next episode are aplenty in this season, where the tension is as tightly strung as ever.
House of Cards plows through another stellar season with incredible performances by Wright and Spacey, who give their characters room to grow while strengthening the bond between the two. The gorgeous cinematography proves to be reason enough to watch alone, and the slightly sporadic nature of the season isn’t a huge drawback, especially since there are so many intense moments to grab viewers’ attention. Despite having such a strong showing, it perfectly sets up the next season. For those who think that ruthlessness defines the show haven’t seen the worst of it yet. Season five already promises viewers more of what made audiences fall in love with the Underwoods.

This week, I decided to take a detour from my usual topic of film and talk about Netflix’s latest original series, entitled Love, co-created by everybody’s favorite comedy uncle Judd Apatow and real-life married couple Paul Rust and Lesley Arfin (both of whom you’ve no doubt seen onscreen and/or heard of their work). I had heard about the show’s “brilliance” from several close friends, and because Netflix’s content has always pretty much been synonymous with quality, I decided I’d set aside the time to watch some of it on a Saturday afternoon. Two episodes in, I had to stop.
At the heart of the show is Mickey (Gillian Jacobs) and Gus (Paul Rust), two L.A. transplants with equally unexciting lives, compounded by the fact that they’ve just gone through pretty bad breakups. The two meet at a gas station in Silverlake and (presumably) fall in love. I say “presumably” because I couldn’t get past the second episode upon my first try. Two weeks later, I put in my best effort to finish the third, and just barely made it out alive.
My number-one issue lay with the casting of our two leads. Mickey is outstandingly gorgeous. Gus, is, well, not. And it may seem juvenile, crass and inappropriately judgmental to critique a show based solely on the beauty of its protagonists, but where Love goes so wrong is precisely in this area. Because, while it may appear “fresh” and “real” when contrasted with typically superficial Hollywood shows of yore (read: 90210 or anything else on The CW past and present), it perpetuates possibly an even worse scenario. As writer EJ Dickson describes in an essay for Mic about the “Hotness Double Standard,” the show furthers “the notion that the average-looking Nice Guy can net the babe of his dreams simply by virtue of his Niceness.” As Dickson goes on to say, “When the Nice Guy is deprived of what he sees as the ultimate reward for his niceness, he gets frustrated. He gets mad. And in some cases, he can get violent.”
Furthermore, the real chances of this show doing harm to younger audiences (and even medium-aged audiences like me and my friends) who swallow what it’s propagating wholeheartedly (simply by virtue of the fact that it’s “real” and “convincing”) just adds to the show’s dangerous cocktail. Before Mickey purportedly even falls for Gus, she’s victim to a string of abuse by even more unattractive men who belittle, demean and use for her body. And whom she sleeps with anyway. How, in any way, is this a good show?
In writing this, I’m looking out for the impressionable younger me. The one who hasn’t read into feminist theory yet or written a paper on the female revenge fantasy in Thelma & Louise or understood that Hollywood’s vision is, in fact, a skewed one. I’m looking out for the 11- to 15-year-old that turned toward television and film to maybe clear up the mystery of what her future might look like. If we’re told that Jacobs — who, for all intents and purposes, could play the goddess Aphrodite if the opportunity arose — is okay with being mistreated and preyed upon by a litany of men, who’s to say that younger me would know to be treated otherwise when the time came?
“It gets better,” several people have told me — not just the ones who loved it the first go-around, but some who had written it off and then went back to see what all the fuss was about. They say that Gus’ “nice guy” qualities diminish and you really get to peel back the layers of Mickey’s alcoholism and depression (if this is the case, then what is truly redeemable about Gus after all?). Instead of perpetuating stereotypes, it apparently attempts to dismantle them. But, as Vox writer Caroline Framke puts it, “If I weren’t committed to watching all 10 episodes of Love for this review, I would have tapped out after the second episode.”
If we were to take the pilot as a stand-alone piece of work, it does nothing but further the Woody-Allen-meets-Diane-Keaton imbalanced example of wish fulfillment we have seen time and time again in Hollywood, while it continues Apatow’s personal stamp of the Nice Guy that gets a girl purely based on the fact that he’s kind. Or, as, Elle Magazine writer Justine Harman describes the “Apatowian” nature of the “nerd revenge fantasy.” Or, as Dickson also describes, “formerly dorky dudes enacting their high school sexual fantasies.”
And so, Love begs the question: should a show be allowed waste your time for several episodes before actually getting to the heart of the series? Should it be allowed to enrage before qualifying itself with, “Don’t worry! We weren’t doing what you thought we were for the first three episodes! It’s okay now!”
In an already-saturated market, with new webseries and award-winning content springing up everywhere, from Hulu to Amazon to FX and back again, it can be hard to choose exactly what deserves watching. As the pool becomes increasingly bigger (National Geographic and Snapchat are two unlikely outlets that have both funded scripted content in the last year) the ability to discern between what I should and shouldn’t spend my time on is paramount if I ever hope to lead a functioning adult life. So for now, Love will remain unwatched in my Netflix queue — hopefully until Apatow decides not to perpetuate the hot girl/nerdy guy trope any more. At that point, Love will be just a bad and far-distant memory, with no bearing on the future, be it mine or anyone else’s.

Terror Birds is the latest addition to the long list of independent, on-demand horror films being released in recent years. Directed by Sean Cain, the movie is slated for a release on Tuesday. With a relatively inexperienced cast, the horror flick focuses on the experiences of Maddy Stern, played by actress Jessica Lee Keller.
Following her father’s week-long disappearance during a bird-watching trip, Maddy decides to embark on a trip in the Texan wilderness to find him. Despite her insistence on conducting the search by herself, Maddy is accompanied by her roommate, Paige. Matters are only made worse when Paige invites Maddy’s former love interest Justin, his current girlfriend Taylor and his best friend Brett on the excursion. After following different hints throughout the forest, the group is ultimately led to a wealthy scientist’s private aviary, where they discover a pair of predatory birds believed to have been extinct for centuries. The five, after realizing the cause of Maddy’s father’s death and disappearance, are ultimately forced to escape the clutches of the scientist and his terror birds.
The film is yet another flop in the indie horror movie scene. With countless clichés and innumerable accounts of flawed acting, Terror Birds reaffirms the heinous reputation that many independent horror films carry. A number of instances exemplify the logical errors of which the filmmakers failed to take notice. For example, in one scene, Maddy and Justin attempt to flee from the terror birds by driving off in a van with an open trunk. About a minute later, it becomes devastatingly evident to the viewer that the van’s trunk somehow closed within the matter of seconds since the two characters entered the front of the vehicle. What is even more appalling is that the cast lacks general consistency and skill to convey their roles. Lindsey Sporrer, who plays Taylor, miserably fails at even portraying the self-absorbed blond stereotype that is not uncommon in the average horror flick.
It is very important to note, however, that the film’s most important factors were butchered by horrendous CGI effects and upsettingly terrible animation and editing. Despite the filmmakers’ efforts, the terror birds failed to integrate with the real-life setting of the film, making the birds look almost as if they were placed from a low-quality animation studio and plastered into the Texan landscape.
Moreover, the editing prevented the most important feature of horror movies, the gore factor, from even being realistic or remotely believable. Production and make-up design failed miserably in creating blood splatters and presenting wounds on characters, thereby further degrading the nature of the film. The effects in Terror Birds will most likely remind viewers of the fake blood and gauze they purchased from Party City for their costumes during fifth grade.
Despite its attempt at emulating an indie, more suspenseful version of the 1993 classic Jurassic Park, Terror Birds failed to even fulfill the requirements of its genre as a horror movie because of its half-humorous, half-baked storyline. Oftentimes, it is difficult to decipher whether or not the film is a horror flick or a parody because of its over-the-top scripting, and it does not help that the film lacks the acting talent required to make the story believable. Clumsy, poorly-executed and sloppy, Terror Birds serves as a reminder of the inevitable failures of independent, low-budget horror films being wastefully produced today.

Performing arts legend Bill T. Jones will grace the stage of Bovard Auditorium, courtesy of USC Visions and Voices this Tuesday at 7:30 p.m with free admission.
The show will be a two-part event, with a performance featuring USC students in both the Thornton School of Music and the Kaufman School of Dance alongside Jones, as well as a discussion following the performance with Kenneth Foster, director of the USC Arts Leadership Program. The performance will be an innovative take on Story/Time, a spoken word piece immersed in dance and music. Each time Story/Time is performed, it is different because Jones works with new dancers and musicians who all have different interpretations of the work.
Jones is highly regarded as a leader in the arts, establishing himself in many different fields including dance, theater, music and activism. He initially studied to be a dancer at the State University of New York at Binghamton and has worked for years in the dance world. He has received numerous awards for his work, including a number of Tony Awards for his choreography, and has made groundbreaking progress in the arts community, forming his own dance company, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, in the 1980s. In 2011, he was appointed the executive artistic director of New York Live Arts, which is “an internationally recognized destination for innovative movement-based artistry offering audiences access to art and artists notable for their conceptual rigor, formal experimentation and active engagement with the social, political and cultural currents of our times,” according to the organization’s website.
Although he has done a majority of his work in the dance community, Jones has also worked on Broadway, in film and television, as well as new media, collaborating on different art installations and shows (New York Live Arts).
Tuesday night is sure to be a captivating and inspiring event featuring a visionary artist.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.
Maybe it’s the generic “Lol” or the “Goodnight!” or maybe even the seemingly promising “See you later :).”
You know, it’s the last text — that last time you hear from him before he disappears from your life.
You see, so many boys these days seem to have the idea that the right way to end any kind of “thing” is by just halting communication.
There’s even a name for it. It’s called “ghosting,” and according to Urban Dictionary, that means the act of abruptly cutting off all communication with someone the ghoster has been seeing, in hopes that the ghostee will just “get the hint.”
This happens all over the world — to me, my friends, my classmates and my colleagues. It’s an epidemic that’s spreading faster than the swine flu back in ’09.
And it’s not cool.
Last thing you remember, he was telling you “We should get coffee or something next week!” or “I’ll take you surfing one day soon!”
Then, next thing you know, you’re racking your brain, wondering what you did that caused him to stop texting you, to stop wanting to see you.
After hearing so many stories like this from my friends and experiencing this enough times myself, channeling my inner Carrie Bradshaw, I couldn’t help but wonder…
What happened to respect?
Now I can’t claim that girls never do this either. I’ll admit, I’ve done it myself once or twice. But from what I’ve seen and heard, us girls do this on a significantly smaller scale than boys do.
Sometimes it appears to be understood that whatever was going on between you and another is finished. It’s perfectly natural to feel this way; sometimes excitement dies down, sometimes you meet someone else whom you click with more.
But I still think it’s a matter of respect. Don’t we owe it to this person — to whom we’ve dedicated so much time and have gotten so intimate with — to let them know that our feelings have changed or even just that we’re not down to hook up anymore?
That way, we save this “ghostee” from wasting time wondering: Is he/she ever going to text me again? What did I do wrong?
I’ve done some research on the subject (by asking some of my close guy friends what the deal is with “ghosting”).
The phrase “fear of commitment” was thrown around a lot in their responses.
While that could be a valid reason for wanting out of any kind of commitment with another person, it’s no excuse for getting out in such a way.
Girls and boys of the world, let’s try to remember a little thing called respect.
I hear it goes a long way…

Most college students depend on Chipotle to satisfy their burrito cravings, and that makes sense. After all, Chipotle has quick service, quality food and a wide variety of fillings. On top of everything else, the food is pretty affordable. What’s not to love? 
However, while Chipotle burritos are great, they aren’t the only option. Once in a while, USC students should branch out and explore different options. Los Angeles is a cultural hotspot with an extremely diverse collection of Mexican food joints. In fact, sometimes, it even seems like L.A. has a taqueria or Mexican food truck on every street corner. Below is a list of nearby trucks and restaurants  students can venture out for a bite of non-Chipotle burrito. 
If you’re a USC student, you probably recognize the name La Taquiza. This restaurant is located on Figueroa, so most people pass it on the walk from campus to The Row. La Taquiza is known for its delicious burritos, constructed with homemade tortillas, fresh fillings and quality meat. The best part: it’s open 24 hours.

People that have tried El Chato claim it has the best burritos in L.A. This tiny truck parks close to USC on West Olympic Boulevard. El Chato has tasty burrito fillings like grilled onions and even pineapple. Their meat is fresh and high-quality — favorites include Carne Asada and Carnitas.

This Mexican restaurant is known for its massive burritos and buttery tortillas. The burritos are extra large and packed full of filling. Their signature dish is the chile relleno burrito stuffed with cheese, beans, carne asada and roast poblano chile peppers. Try it yourself to see how it matches up against Chipotle!

This Mexican food joint has fresh, quality ingredients. Their specialties include homemade flour tortillas and a signature chile sauce. Any food you get here will taste great, but favorites include the Beef and Red Chile burrito and the Bean and Cheese. This Mexican food kitchen surely won’t disappoint.

At some point, every USC student should venture over to West L.A. to try a burrito from Eduardo’s. They have great carne asada and guacamole that keep people coming back. Popular burritos include the classic Border Burrito with cheese, beans, guacamole and any meat. They also have a make-your-own burrito option.
