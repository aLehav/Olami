Keck Medicine of USC will launch a clinical trial to study the effects of an anti-inflammatory drug on treating patients with the coronavirus, according to a Wednesday press release from Keck Medicine. The medication, baricitinib, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis. 
Inflammation resulting from the virus may be the underlying cause behind severe respiratory complications that require hospitalization and intubation, said Dr. Michael Dube, a Keck Medicine infectious disease specialist and the Keck School of Medicine interim chief of infectious diseases, in the press release.
“The primary problem that is occurring in people who develop critical illness … is excessive inflammation in the body, and that affects the lungs and other organs,” Dube said. “[Baricitinib] appears to be able to affect some of the key inflammation pathways that are leading to critical illness in COVID-19.”
Dube is conducting the trial alongside Heinz-Josef Lenz, associate director of clinical research at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, who serves as the main investigator in the study. Dube said the researchers hope to start enrolling patients in the study starting Thursday.
The double-blind study, which will run for three months, is expected to survey the effects of baricitinib on 144 random patients with moderate to severe coronavirus infections from Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center, Keck Hospital of USC and USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. Half of the patients will receive the drug, while the other half will receive a placebo. 
Participants will include patients who exhibit moderate to severe symptoms of the coronavirus infection but who have not reached a critical stage requiring intubation. Patients with higher risk factors are also eligible to participate.
According to Dube, patients with moderate disease have at least one risk factor — age greater than 60, diabetes, morbid obesity or high blood pressure — in addition to the coronavirus and signs of pneumonia. Patients with severe disease have low oxygen levels in their blood.  
For some patients, the virus can trigger a cytokine storm, an immune response with a large number of small infection-fighting proteins which in greater quantities can damage tissue and lead to organ failure, Dube said. Research has indicated that baricitinib lowers the levels of certain cytokines.
“Our premise is that by using baricitinib to reduce the inflammation, we may be able to slow down the progress of the disease, stop the need for a ventilator and save lives,” Dube said in the press release.
Dube and Lenz will also work with Keck School of Medicine assistant professor of translational genomics Bodour Salhia during the trial. Salhia will collect blood samples from patients to look for molecular biomarkers to identify people who are at high risk for developing severe symptoms.
In addition to piloting the study, Keck Medicine resumed a limited number of medically necessary and time-sensitive procedures and surgeries at select locations, including Verdugo Hills Hospital and Keck Medical Center, Monday. Nonemergent but medically necessary elective operations, along with gynecological, orthopedic and general surgeries, are some of the services that have resumed and will be expanded May 11.  
In a Monday press release, Keck Medicine said it is resuming services in accordance with public health guidelines. The medical center said it is maintaining the health and safety of its employees by providing personal protective equipment, screening for fevers upon entrance into its facilities, testing patients for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance of their procedures and continuing its telemedicine services for nonemergent services.

A lawsuit alleging USC is profiting from the coronavirus pandemic by withholding tuition and fee refunds was filed against the University and Board of Trustees Tuesday. The filing follows Provost Charles Zukoski’s communitywide announcement April 28 that the University will not provide prorated tuition refunds for the spring semester conducted partially online.  
National class action law firm Berger Montague filed the lawsuit on behalf of plaintiff Latisha Watson, a graduate student studying social work. The complaint argued that in-person classes transitioned to remote instruction via Zoom are lower quality than USC’s online courses, and it asked that the University provide students with prorated refunds for tuition and programming fees since students began attending classes online March 11. 
“USC is thus profiting from COVID-19 while further burdening students and their families, many of whom have borne the brunt of the pandemic, themselves been laid off, or who are ill or suffering from financial setbacks,” the complaint read. “Both contract and equity demand that [the University] disgorge their ill-gotten funds.”
In the filing, Watson also contended that the online experience is not equivalent to the in-person campus experience, citing reduced interactions with mentors, guest lecturers, student programs and athletics. According to the complaint, Watson has spent more than $20,000 this semester in tuition, dining and student programming fees. 
“Plaintiff and Class members have been provided with a second rate online substitute which is cheaper for USC to provide by simply putting existing professors and classes on Zoom,” the complaint read. “USC’s post-COVID-19 online student offerings do not even come close to comparing with either USC’s in-person course experience or its online offerings … Instead, they are overpriced bubble-gum and duct-tape substitutes.” 
The complaint also argued that with $19.3 million in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act funding, the University should be able to provide students with tuition and dining reimbursements. Students who vacated University housing have received prorated housing and dining refunds.
“We believe that USC’s refusal to refund students’ tuition and fees during this crisis is unconscionable,” shareholder and head of Berger Montague’s San Diego office Benjamin Galdston said in a press release. “USC is one of the nation’s most expensive private universities with a $6 billion endowment and flush with nearly $20 million in taxpayer-funded relief. Having failed to provide what it promised students, USC cannot keep their money.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said it is aware of the lawsuit and bases its decisions about navigating the coronavirus crisis on guidance from public health officials and student well-being. The University also said it believes it has maintained academic standards during the transition to online learning required by California’s safer-at-home order. 
“Led by its committed and dedicated faculty, USC pivoted immediately to deliver quality instruction in an online format when the entire world was impacted by COVID-19,” the statement read. “Faculty and staff have worked tirelessly to connect with students to ensure that academic work continues on track and that progress toward the completion of a USC degree continues.” 
An online petition created by Bianca Sun, a graduate student studying law, has gained more than 7,000 signatures since early March requesting USC to provide partial tuition reimbursement for students to compensate for in-person classes transitioning online and other traditional campus resources. The lawsuit also looks to represent students who are facing a similar situation to the plaintiff. 
“Plaintiff and similarly situated USC students are entitled to have Defendants disgorge in full the portions of their payments for unused services and to refund their tuition for substandard classes,” the suit read. “Plaintiffs bring this class action for injunctive, declaratory, and equitable relief, and any other available remedies, resulting from Defendants’ illegal, inequitable, and unfair retention of the funds paid by Plaintiff and the other students in the proposed Class.”
