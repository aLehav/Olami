No. 2 women’s water polo finished in third place at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational this weekend at Irvine. The Trojans stumbled against No. 4 Stanford in the semifinals before redeeming themselves against No. 5 Hawai‘i to end the tournament. They now have a 11-2 overall record.
“Overall, we played good,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “A lot of good stuff came out of it, and we’re going to use that for the second part of the season … and preparations for conference finals.”
As expected, USC cruised through group play, sprinting past Pomona-Pitzer 21-2, and taking care of No. 13 Long Beach State 16-5. 
In the tournament opener against the Sagehens, redshirt sophomore Tilly Kearns and senior utilities Bayley Weber and Sophia Lucas all notched hat tricks — Kearns was a perfect 3-for-3 on the day. 
Defensively, the Trojans easily won the turnover battle, forcing 16 while committing none themselves. Junior goalie Carolyne Stern kept a clean sheet in the first half, and redshirt junior Erin Tharp stepped into the cage and made six second-half saves.
With the game practically over by the start of the third frame, Pintaric used his depth, playing a few more seniors and underclassmen. USC continued to dominate with a well-rounded attack that saw 12 different players scratch the scoreboard Friday.
Saturday morning’s clash with Long Beach State was more of the same. Kearns registered another hat trick in less than 10 minutes of game time, while freshman utility Honnie Vandeweghe-O’Shea chipped in three scores. 
But after a strong showing in group play, the Trojans crumbled against the Cardinal, 16-10.
The semifinal match boasted an overabundance of stardom, with three Tokyo 2020 gold medalists from Team USA: USC’s Paige Hauschild and Stanford sisters, grad student Makenzie and senior Aria Fischer.
Hauschild led the Trojans with a trio of scores, but the defense couldn’t contain Makenzie. The driver got off 11 shots and converted six of them, including four on even strength.
“Defensively … in the first and the last quarter, we allowed 11 goals … that’s very uncharacteristic,” Pintaric said. “[But] a lot of good stuff came out of the loss to UCLA. We applied it against Cal, and I know the team will respond the same to this loss, learn from mistakes and become better.”
USC’s offense paled in comparison. The Trojans did well to draw fouls, forcing 15 exclusions but floundered when it came to executing off of 6-on-5s. They were an abysmal 4-for-13 on power plays. 
“Credit to the aggressiveness of Stanford’s defense,” Pintaric said. “But when I watched the game again, the plays were executed right. We just didn’t finish the shots, which are our mistakes … It’s the timing to step in and finish — that’s the difference between bar in and bar out.”
The Stanford loss set up a meeting with Hawai‘i, whom USC defeated earlier this season. This time, it was yet another grind-it-out victory. Hauschild tallied another hat trick, along with two assists. 
In a relatively clean game that heard few whistles, the Trojans were clinical when it counted: 2-for-3 on power plays and perfect on penalty attempts from Kearns and Weber. 
After playing nine games in the last two weeks, USC will take a much-needed two-week break.
“This two-week period is really designed to reboot conditioning-wise, to get healthy and to work on new stuff,” Pintaric said. “This is going to be a great chance for us to really … get closer to where we were with the super senior team last year. I’m really looking forward to the next chapter for us.”
USC will host Indiana Mar. 12 at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

Most people, well-versed in art history or not, will have heard the names Vincent Van Gogh and Michelangelo. In fact, their life stories were so extraordinary that, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, films about each artist’s life were released: “At Eternity’s Gate” by Julian Schnabel and “Sin” by Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky.
More than a clear-cut biography of Michelangelo, “Sin” explores a deeper layer of the sculptor’s mentality and the processes by which he came to create irreplaceable masterpieces. According to Variety’s review, the film leans heavily into the artist’s contradictions: He was at once divine and a scoundrel, brilliant and crazy. The range of qualities this singular man possessed was key to his unique outlook on the world, the review notes.
One of the central elements to Michelangelo’s character (played by Alberto Testone), which is beautifully expressed through poetic dialogue and visual images in the film, is his need to continue searching for something. At one point, Michelangelo mutters to himself, “I wanted to find God, but I only found Man.” His need to transcend reality and the tangibility of life as it appears is the drawing force of Michelangelo’s sculptures.
“Sin” focuses on this internal discovery rather than the artworks themselves. The sculptures are a byproduct of Michelangelo’s internalization of the physical world, and by using this depiction of Michelangelo, it creates a deeper understanding his artistic genius.
“At Eternity’s Gate” uses a similar method of storytelling to explore the mindset and genius of Vincent Van Gogh. 
According to a review by Time, actor Willem Dafoe, who portrays Van Gogh in the film, describes it as “impressionist portrait” more than a biopic. One of the most fascinating depictions of Van Gogh in the film are in his moments of periodic breakdowns when he seems to dissociate from reality.
In Van Gogh’s “other world” moments, Schnabel uses a yellow-light filter and weaves together various shots of nature to immerse the viewer into the mind of Van Gogh. In doing this, Schnabel creates a similar sensation to that of “Sin” as the viewer is taken through the eyes of the artist, rather than purely observing the artwork and thus allows for a deeper understanding of the layers behind each painting that Van Gogh created. 
One of the most curious elements of both “At Eternity’s Gate” and “Sin” is that, even though the depicted artists are revered as geniuses today, they are shown as embodying some quality of madness supposedly connected to genius. 
Before discussing the quality of Michelangelo’s and Van Gogh’s madness, it is also important to note that another similarity between the two was the element of searching for something greater than the physical world had to offer. Their art was a byproduct of discovering something larger than themselves.
I would argue that what is perceived and portrayed as madness between these characters is truly a deeper understanding of the world than what is commonly found. 
The reason Michelangelo’s sculptures and Van Gogh’s paintings remain famous today is because there is a sense of realness and mystery about their art, yet at the same time, there is truth. These qualities together create timeless pieces that will continue to amaze and engage audiences. 
The films do an incredible job of breathing life into the figures of Michelangelo and Van Gogh. Rather than portraying them as madmen, both films explore the artists’ unique mentalities and internal struggles to highlight the nature of their genius.
Michelangelo and Van Gogh, through these films, are given a more human, relatable personification, while also retaining their status as deities of the arts. What makes the two so captivating is understanding what exactly they are searching for in life and whether or not they found it.
On some level, we are all searching for something. These men just happened to get farther than we did, and their art is the bridge between our world and the one they strove to find.

For queer people, the silver screen can be a source of power, comfort and representation of who we are and what we could be. The following films examine the queer experience in all its beauty and messiness — from its highs to its lows, from happily-ever-after to heartbreak. Because for every “Call Me by Your Name” and “Carol,” there’s another queer story hiding in plain sight, waiting to be discovered.
If you like: “Love, Simon” (2018)
Try: “The Way He Looks” (2014)
While “Love, Simon” made headlines in 2018 for being the first mainstream teen movie to center a gay romance, its surface-level exploration of adolescent queerness and trite dialogue left many queer audiences wanting more.
Adapted from a 2010 short film, Brazilian gem “The Way He Looks” follows a blind teen who befriends and falls for a new classmate. It’s an equally heartwarming tale of gay coming-of-age as “Love, Simon,” but where the latter leans on coming-out tropes and teen-movie clichés, “The Way He Looks” offers a more earnest and joyful look at gay teenage crushes and first romances.
If you like: “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (2019)
Try: “Water Lilies” (2007)
Céline Sciamma’s visually and thematically stunning “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” was her grand opus, a culmination of her many years spent meticulously picking apart queer desire and romance under oppressive circumstances on-screen.
Her lesser known 2007 debut directorial feature, “Water Lilies” — also starring “Portrait”’s Adèle Haenel — beautifully captures the physical and emotional frenzy of coming into your sexuality in an explicitly lesbian context. Following three 15 year-old girls as they play a game of cat-and-mouse over the course of one summer in French suburbia, the film was a subtly triumphant showcase of Sciamma’s budding talents as a naturalistic filmmaker, one unafraid to let her queer characters’ burgeoning emotions speak for themselves.
If you like: “Moonlight” (2016)
Try: “Mysterious Skin” (2004)
The revered “Moonlight” garnered widespread praise and accolades — including an Oscars Best Picture win — for its heartbreaking depiction of coming-of-age, trauma, vulnerability and sexuality through the lens of Blackness.
The film’s emotional core, chapter structure and juxtaposition of tenderness and brutality are mirrored in Gregg Araki’s haunting 2004 film “Mysterious Skin,” which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet as two boys who experience a disturbing event as young children and follow incredibly disparate paths as they grow up. Like “Moonlight,” the culmination of coming-of-age and queer elements is both emotionally devastating and incredibly affecting.
If you like: “Booksmart” (2019)
Try: “But I’m a Cheerleader” (1999)
In 2019, Olivia Wilde’s “Booksmart” charmed audiences with its comedic tale of two teenage overachievers embarking on a night of partying to make up for four years of rule-following. The film also received praise for its inclusion of a lesbian protagonist, Amy (Kaitlyn Dever), who wrestles with a high school crush and ends up finding love in an unexpected place.
“But I’m a Cheerleader,” directed by Jamie Babbit, is a similarly over-the-top adventure centered around goody-two-shoes Megan, a closeted cheerleader sent to conversion therapy by concerned family and friends. Between “gender-affirming” activities that see women patients vacuuming pink rooms and RuPaul’s performance as an “ex-gay” conversion therapy leader, the film offers a satirical and campy tale of self-discovery and queer romance with the same knowing grin donned by “Booksmart” 20 years later.
If you like: “Call Me by Your Name” (2017)
Try: “Weekend” (2011) and “Sorry Angel” (2018)
Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me by Your Name” is a breathtaking portrait of love and longing set in the gorgeous Italian town of Crema. Helmed by a career-defining performance from then-newcomer Timothée Chalamet, the film earned widespread acclaim as well as nominations for Best Picture and Best Actor at the 2018 Academy Awards.
The intimate “Weekend,” directed by Andrew Haigh, follows two men over the course of one weekend who watch a casual encounter turn into something more. Set in Paris, Cristophe Honoré’s bittersweet French romance “Sorry Angel” follows the course of a doomed relationship between a middle-aged writer and an optimistic college student. Although grounded more in reality than “Call Me by Your Name”’s peach-sweet summer daydream, both films unearth similar sentiments of yearning and loving against a ticking clock.
If you like: “Tangerine” (2015)
Try: “Nowhere” (1997)
Sean Baker’s exquisitely chaotic “Tangerine,” shot entirely on three iPhones, offered a slice of Los Angeles like no other movie could. Described by Baker as a movie specifically about the corner of Santa Monica and Highland, its humanistic portrait of the transgender women on that street corner proved how essential setting can be to modern-day storytelling.
1997 cinematic fever dream “Nowhere,” the second film on this list by director Gregg Araki, follows a group of oddball queer college students in the same city as they navigate relationships, existentialism and alien attacks. Although “Nowhere” takes on a far more wacky and satirical tone than “Tangerine,” both films shine as celebratory depictions of Los Angeles queer subcultures.
The extensive catalogue of queer cinema is rich with emotion and power, rebellious and raw, yet too often overlooked. So your next time you cozy up for movie night, consider making room for the queer stories that don’t make it to the award shows or onto the front page of Netflix.

Few names have established themselves as the legends of mainstream pop-punk. For any young person alive in the last 30 years, there is no pop-punk name as pervasively dominant as Avril Lavigne. Her iconic discography, including hits such as “Girlfriend,” “Sk8r Boi” and “What the Hell,” still resonate with many as nostalgic radio gems of the era. Avril Lavigne was undeniably the queen — the ambassador of pop-punk to the world.
Cut to 2022. Thanks to customized music streaming services and social media apps such as TikTok, popular music nowadays is twisting backward into throwbacks and expediting the careers of new artists upon their first viral hit. Thus, nostalgic genre blending, especially with pop-punk (see Olivia Rodrigo’s “good 4 u”) is as important as ever to create that familiarly digestible earworm on a TikTok sound. 
Re-entering this landscape is none other than the princess herself, Avril Lavigne, with her seventh studio album, “Love Sux.”
“Love Sux” marks a return to her roots after a brief departure to emotional, heartfelt pop in “Head Above Water.” In a recent Billboard interview, Lavigne said she “was ready to rock the fuck out,” a sentiment that could not come through more clearly during a listen-through. This album screams of catharsis for the artist after years of restraint. Was she successful?
Behind the screams — however fun — lies not much else, unfortunately. Lavigne kicks off her album with “Cannonball,” a rollicking, headbanging track that begs to be jumped around and screamed to. Full of calls to action like, “Are you ready? / Let’s go!” and rocking guitar riffs, the song announces the tone of the album and flies past too quickly to catch your breath.
Consider your breath lost for the next 30 minutes. On an album of 12 tracks, nine of them are under three minutes. It’s as though Lavigne barely opens up the opportunity to take a small bite of a song before you’re careening into the next. And, without much time spent to get to know each track, there’s not much to grasp on to or differentiate from the others.
Let’s be clear: Fans aren’t expecting a mind-blowingly deep, lyrically revolutionary album. Audiences were told pop-punk, so they were expecting pop-punk: delicious guitar-riffing, nostalgic headbanging and screamable melodies. But where Lavigne falls short is actually the standard she set for herself. Throughout the early-mid 2000s, Lavigne gave us a reason to scream about falling in love with skater boys, stealing someone’s boyfriend and never growing up. Her music didn’t need to spark philosophical debates — it was just fun and unique. 
Flash forward 20 years later, and most of the music on “Love Sux” is derivative of its predecessors. “Kiss Me Like The World Is Ending” sounds like an outro song to a 2000s teen rom-com. The lyrics are disappointingly simplistic and full of pouty lyrics like “Do you promise it’s forever? / Will you meet me up in heaven?” The distinguishably fast-paced pop-punk drums and flashy guitar riffs are fun but so are those in most of the album. “Bite Me,” one of the singles released ahead of the album, is a stock angry breakup anthem without much of a purpose other than to say, “You’re gonna wish I was your wifey.” 
Also important to note are Lavigne’s features on the album. “Bois Lie,” featuring Machine Gun Kelly, is a decent collaboration. Through a he-said-she-said dialogue, Lavigne and Kelly’s voices blend well together, and the song even boasts one of the best lyrics on the album: “You put a knife into my back and tried to write your name.”
Others, like blackbear’s feature on “Love It When You Hate Me,” are certainly more disappointing, with a generically whiny verse that sticks out against Lavigne’s shiny vocals. “All I Wanted,” featuring blink-182’s Mark Hoppus, also falls short of its intentions to be a meaningful collaboration. This is partially due to Hoppus’s lack of vocal cohesion with the song ,as well as the lack of creative quality in the track itself. These featured artists barely sounded interested in the album.
Several stand out tracks elevate the album. The titular song, “Love Sux” balances sonic innovation and pure amusement with boisterous style. The track adds high-pitched piano chords to the usual guitar-drums combination and is riddled with pop-punk squeals and yelling that truly propel the song forward. The lyrics also tell a more compelling, current story of being sick of dating, with hilarious lines such as “Let’s play a game of tic-tac-toe / I’ma go and make all my exes say ‘oh.’”
The penultimate ballad “Dare To Love Me” shows off Lavigne’s skillful vocals in a wandering melody against vulnerable, stripped instrumentals. By painting a more complex story of feeling unlovable, she captures a feeling evocative of her older ballads. Album closer “Break of A Heartache” is also successful in its experimentation, with innovative syncopation and unexpected breaks in instrumentation captivating the listener one last time.
In several ways, “Love Sux” achieves exactly its intentions: being a screamable, headbanging pop-punk album that’s just as lighthearted and fun-angry to listen to as it must be to perform. However, for a seasoned veteran such as Lavigne, who has contributed so many unique, time-capsule messages through her music, there is so much left to be desired. Music today requires more than a simplistic formula, and there is room for improvement Lavigne did not grow into.
So, while “Love Sux” would be a blast to see in concert, its disappointing execution stands as a harrowing example of music that was perhaps meant to be performed, not listened to.

The prospect of going to college had always been rather blurry for Chelsea Bradley. Growing up, she considered college the “ultimate goal,” but coming from a low-income family, she knew she would have to bear the cost of tuition herself. After becoming the first in her family — and in her high school — to attend a four-year university, Bradley will graduate from USC in May alongside her peers in the Bovard Scholars’ first cohort. 
Despite her fervor to continue her education, Bradley didn’t have access to the resources and knowledge she’d need when applying to college — Her high school counselor was unfamiliar with the Common Application and her relatives had minimal knowledge of fee waivers and financial aid documentation. 
Bradley, now a senior majoring in psychology, considers herself “lucky” to have heard from a friend that USC launched Bovard Scholars, a college preparatory program for students from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. Accepted as part of the program’s first cohort the summer before her senior year of high school, she gained “invaluable” insight into the college application process and prepared for the transition to college. A soon-to-be college graduate, Bradley said she’s grateful for the opportunities the program opened up for her.
“It feels surreal … The program saw something in us, and we do have that something in us,” Bradley said. “The fact that I’m about to get a degree from [USC] is insane to me, especially since any degree would have made my family proud, but that it’s a USC degree is definitely impressive.”
Bovard Scholars is a year-long program with a three-week residential experience at USC that gives low-income, high-achieving high school juniors and seniors a taste of college life, supports them in exploring their academic interests, readies them for testing and helps them navigate scholarships and financial aid applications.
“Our program integrates selective college advising with in-depth career exploration in order to empower our scholars to find the college and career pathway that positions them for future success and feels like the best fit for them,” Bovard Scholars Program Director Lisa Mataczynski said. 
Since its inception in 2017, when the program welcomed 49 students, Bovard Scholars has expanded to accept groups of approximately 120 students each year. Of the program’s 383 alumni, 78 matriculated at USC. 
Mataczynski said she enjoys seeing Bovard Scholars alumni giving back to the program beyond their formal time in it, such as by serving as Resident Assistants for the summer intensive experience, providing mentorship to new scholars and working in the program’s main office. The first cohort is “significant,” Matazcynski said, and especially “meaningful” to her because of the extent to which the group shaped the program for years to come. 
“We administered a number of surveys to them, and I also spent a lot of evenings at dinner or sitting in the residence hall common areas with them chatting to find out what they wanted out of the experience, what was going well, what wasn’t and talking about their hopes for the future,” Mataczynski said.
While students in the cohort are scattered across a number of different colleges nationwide, Mataczynski said they’re still a “tight- knit group.” To see the first set of students graduating is “exciting,” she said.
“Our scholars have worked so hard through college and then for years prior to that, so to see them put in the hard work and pursue their passions is really inspiring,” Mataczynski said. 
Another student in the program’s first cohort was Edgar Guadalupe Sanchez, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, who knew college was for him since elementary school. During a project in the second grade, Sanchez declared he would attend UCLA and study film. Beyond opening his eyes to the financial possibility of attending a four-year school, Bovard Scholars made Sanchez feel as though USC was “investing” in him, which drove his decision to become a Trojan.
“The most valuable thing I found out with the program was realizing that USC was the school for me,” Sanchez said. “I knew that I would feel safe and comfortable at USC.”
Coming from an underrepresented background and as the first to graduate college on his dad’s side of the family, Sanchez said he feels privileged to accomplish what others from his community haven’t had the chance to.
“I’m very proud of myself,” Sanchez said. “I really have gone really far and all of this just demonstrates to me that I could just really do anything … and I’m only going to get further.”
After he graduates, Sanchez plans to connect with his creative side and find ways to combine engineering and fashion for greater sustainability. 
“I just want to innovate to innovate, and create to create — whatever happens out of that happens,” Sanchez said. “I’m looking forward to anything.”
For the program’s first cohort, the Bovard Scholars experience did not stop once they matriculated to college. Students from the cohort that enrolled at USC meet up regularly at monthly luncheons and continue to support and motivate each other, said Cheyenne Chrisp, a senior majoring in environmental studies who attended the program.
“It’s kind of like a little family,” Chrisp said. “Whenever we run into each other, it’s like, ‘Ah, you knew me back then. We go way back.’ That’s what it feels like. When I see someone from [Bovard Scholars], it’s just a breath of fresh air.”
Through her studies at USC, Chrisp discovered a passion for sound healing and mindfulness, which she hopes to pursue after turning her tassel. The “most beautiful” parts of her experience at the University, she said, are the connections she made with professors who guided and inspired her and the resilience she found in herself.
“I just think [graduating is] definitely a reflection of my discipline and my hard work and my thirst to always continue to learn,” Chrisp said. “I made a promise to myself … I am going to do whatever it takes, I’m going to go through all of these hoops, obstacles to get there.”
As she walks up to the porch step of the momentous milestone that is college graduation, Bradley will see something that she’s “thought about since middle school” come to fruition. Her accomplishments, she said, are a testament to Bovard Scholars’ value and the impact it had on her and other members of the program’s first cohort. 
“We’re fighting on — being at USC — because we all fought through incredible challenges,” Bradley said. “We’re thriving and we’re getting our degrees and it proves that the Bovard Scholars program is worth it because we’re the first people to finish officially and we’re a success.”

Wrapping around USC Village square, the line for Insomnia Cookies’ grand opening Saturday night was sprinkled with students in onesies, draped in blankets or donning slippers, all eager to spend their dough on cookies. 
The long-anticipated grand opening drew hundreds of students, with many waiting more than four hours — some sitting in chairs with groups of friends, others playing “milk pong” or sparring in an impromptu chess game — as they anticipated warm snickerdoodle, chocolate chunk and “deluxe confetti” cookies. 
As the clock struck and passed 2 a.m., the excitement of hundreds of students continued to ring throughout USC Village, each waiting for their opportunity to bring home cookies for themselves or grateful roommates. 
“I got to spend time with my friends at least,” said Katelyn Hsu, a freshman majoring in human biology who waited for four hours to place orders for herself and her suitemates. “I wouldn’t say it was the best use of [four] hours, but I think it was easy to talk to people and meet new people.”
From 8 p.m. to 3 a.m., the grand opening was “PJ Party” themed, offering a free six-pack of cookies with any purchase to customers who came dressed in pajamas.
The store, located where Baked Bear used to be, sells cookies, brownies, ice cream, milk and more. Insomnia Cookies expressed interest in coming to USC Village for several years, according to Brian Wilson, the executive director for Real Estate Development and Leasing, University Real Estate. 
“Their cookies and ice cream are loved by students and the broader community at many universities,” wrote Wilson in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “They are a natural fit.”
Insomnia Cookies started in a University of Pennsylvania college campus dorm room. Since then, it has grown into a popular bakery featuring delivery options and a wide array of desserts.
The soft opening on Tuesday  drew in crowds of students, offering a “buy one, get two cookies free” deal. The long line outside the store Tuesday night intrigued Anay Karwal, who decided to try it out the next day. 
“I just saw that really long line outside in the Village and I was curious what the shop was,” said Karwal, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I just saw it opened recently and it was Insomnia Cookies, so I wanted to go check it out.”
Many students were excited to have a dessert place on campus, especially one that stays open late. Dining halls at USC close at 10 p.m., and most of the restaurants at Tutor Campus Center close at 8 or 9 p.m.
“There’s a lot of savory places, but there’s nowhere else in the Village, really, where you can get dessert and something sweet, which is what I wanted,” said Irene Pereira Romero, a freshman majoring in business administration. “I’d come here over a dining hall cookie.”
The store’s hours are noon to 1 a.m. Sunday-Wednesday and noon to 3 a.m. Thursday-Saturday. After 10 p.m., the store is only open to those who have access to USC Village. 
After waiting two hours for his cookies — three double chocolate, one mint double chocolate, one snickerdoodle and one sugar cookie — Jason Yu, a freshman majoring in computer science, reflected on his night in line, spent talking to friends and meeting new people.
“I probably could have worked an hour and made five times as many cookies as I bought,” Yu said. “But maybe the real cookies were the friends we made along the way.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this article stated Insomnia Cookies’ hours as noon to 1 a.m. Sunday-Wednesday and noon to 3 a.m. Thursday-Sunday. The hours have been updated in the article to noon to 1 a.m. Sunday-Wednesday and noon to 3 a.m. Thursday-Saturday.

In the south of Spain, almost at the Mediterranean and the Strait of Gibraltar, lies a city that lacks the international reputation of Madrid and Barcelona but, in recent seasons, has made quite a name for itself in the soccer world. 
Seville, the capital of Andalusia and Spain’s fourth-largest city, hosts two of the nation’s biggest clubs: Sevilla FC and Real Betis. The Spanish first encountered soccer when British expats brought the game to Andalusia. Therefore, Sevilla FC was actually founded nine years before FC Barcelona and 12 years before Real Madrid, while Real Betis followed in 1907. 
Both clubs have only one league title to their name — Betis’s from 1935 and Sevilla’s from 1946 — and have, at times, suffered relegation to Spain’s second tier. But since the 2015-16 season, the pair has been La Liga stalwarts, ushering in an era of intense competitiveness between them. 
This past weekend was the 111th edition of El Gran Derbi. Going into the weekend, Sevilla was second place in the table, with Betis five points behind them in third.
Over the past two decades, Sevilla has undoubtedly had the upper hand on Betis. Since 2005, Sevilla has won two Copa del Rey titles and six Europa Leagues, earning them a reputation for being a great “cup” team who, while lacking league titles, still win trophies with frequency. 
The club’s current manager, Julen Lopetegui, rescued his reputation from a disastrous spell during his time in charge of Real Madrid and instituted his high-pressing 4-3-3 formation with success. 
Sevilla doesn’t have a blistering attack — scoring the sixth-most goals in the league — but its defense troubles opponents and doesn’t allow high-quality chances. Sevilla also has the fewest goals allowed in the league (17) while pressing at a rate of 8.46 passes per defensive actions — meaning the team only allows the opponent to pass about eight or nine times on average before regaining possession. Marcos Acuña at left back and Ivan Rakitic in midfield have excelled this season and form the side’s veteran core along with center back Diego Carlos.
Betis, on the other hand, have flown into 3rd place on the back of their prolific attack, having scored the second most goals in La Liga (48). After a turbulent few seasons the club, which represents the more working class Heliopolis neighborhood of Seville, brought in former Manchester City and West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini to steady the ship — and Pellegrini’s done more than that. 
The Chilean currently holds the club’s best winning percentage — 54.9% across 82 games played — and has brought the best out of a talented team that lacks a true superstar. The closest Betis has to a bona-fide baller is Nabil Fekir who has become something of a talisman in recent seasons. 
Fekir moved to Betis after winning the World Cup with France, a surprising move when Liverpool nearly signed him. He’s since earned cult-hero status on the green-and-white side of Seville, scoring nine goals and assisting seven more in all competitions this season. 
To make a good season even better, Betis knocked Sevilla out of the Copa del Rey in a tense 2-1 win in January and are positioned to make the finals with a draw or win against Rayo Vallecano in the second leg on March 3. If the club were to win the Copa del Rey and finish in second above Sevilla come season’s end, it would arguably be their best season since that 1935 league title. 
Sevilla controlled the match from start to finish. From the opening minutes, Sevilla pressured Betis high and created chance after chance, making it uncomfortable for Betis goalkeeper Claudio Bravo and his backline. 
Betis struggled to regain possession in this cagey atmosphere and eventually suffered the consequences. Sevilla striker Youssef En-Nesyri won a penalty in the 22nd minute after Bravo tripped him, which Rakitic dispatched, sending Bravo the other way. Munir El Haddadi added a goal off the bench in the 41st minute to increase Sevilla’s lead to two before halftime. 
Lopetegui’s Sevilla are not the kind of team to increase their lead recklessly. Sevilla sat deeper in the second half, allowing Betis more of the ball but making it difficult to create any significant chances. 
Time wound down for Betis without legitimately troubling Sevilla. Betis midfielder Sergio Canales scored with a well-placed free kick in the 94th minute, but it was too little too late for Betis as they lost 2-1.
For now, Sevilla remains the dominant side in the city. They will likely finish above Betis in the table this season and have a chance to add another Europa League title to their trophy cabinet. 
Yet, if Betis continues to trend upward, we could see even more competitive and intensely fought editions of El Gran Derbi.

The USC women’s swim team competed in Federal Way, Wash. this weekend for the Pac-12 championships, taking home multiple titles and finishing third overall. 
The Trojans have now won at least two Pac-12 individual titles for 14 consecutive years and in 21 of 22 seasons.
The women’s 200-yard medley relay came in second with a 1:35.40, swam by fifth year Calypso Sheridan, sophomores Kaitlyn Dobler and Anicka Delgado and senior Laticia Transom. The relay team finished between its two main rivals this season — Stanford and UC Berkeley — edging out the Golden Bears by 0.69 seconds. 
Sheridan, Dobler, Transom and sophomore Hanna Henderson placed third in the 200-yard freestyle relay, finishing with a 1:28.02.  The relay team was once again edged out by the Cardinal and Cal, who each took first and second respectively. 
Individually, the Trojans finished strong, taking home multiple wins and frequent placements within the top three slots. Sheridan placed third in the 400-yard individual medley, finishing with a 4:07.18. Delgado took first in the 50-yard freestyle with 21.89. Transom placed second in the 200-yard freestyle with 1:42.49. 
Freshman Caroline Pennington took home the win for the mile swim, finishing 1650 yards in 15:48.69 seconds. Pennington won the Pac-12 title for the Trojans, her first championship meet in Federal Way.  
“Caroline Pennington opened up our final session with a win in the mile,” said senior and team captain Isabelle Odgers in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “That that really got the team fired up and ready to go, and I think that that momentum kind of built throughout the session.” 
For the 200-yard breaststroke race, USC swept the top three finishes with times all under 2:07.00. Odgers took first place with a 2:06.42, winning the Pac-12 championship for the event. Dobler took second place with a 2:06.65, and Sheridan placed in third with a 2:06.97. 
Dobler took victories on multiple fronts in the 100-yard breaststroke, finishing with a 57.31. Dobler not only won the Pac-12 title, but now also holds the USC school record, Pac-12 record and Pac-12 championship record. 
She is now a back-to-back conference champion after competing last year. 
“We had a lot of really good swims, so it’s just really good to have that energy going,” Dobler said. “[The team’s energy] really fueled me in my races and I ended up being really happy with the way I performed.” 
This team’s conference run became a memorable one for them due to the results. According to Odgers, the team’s energy was a game changer for the results of the meet. 
“Last year we took kind of a smaller group to Houston, and that group had really amazing energy, but the presence on deck this year with all 22 amazing women was just something that you can’t really compare to,” Odgers said. 
Overall, the team’s success led to a positive ending to the season, bringing momentum going into March.
 “We were the loudest team and the happiest team on deck,” Odgers said. 
The Trojans will compete in the NCAA tournament from Mar. 16 through Mar. 19 in Atlanta, Ga.

The mere mention of the word “politics” can fuel an argument, deepen stress or catapult a person head-first into despair. Despite the burnout surrounding politics, I can’t ignore the proximity and overlap between the government and nonprofit sectors. 
One of the biggest misconceptions about nonprofits is that they cannot get political without risking the loss of their tax-exempt status. According to Bill Shore from the Stanford Social Innovation Review, while it is true that the typical 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization cannot work on campaigns such as “donating to candidates, and engaging in lobbying beyond certain generously defined limits,” there is still a wide range of work nonprofits can do with advocacy.
Shore, the founder of Share of Strength, the national nonprofit to end childhood hunger in the United States, writes about his organization’s transition to advocacy. He explains that, at first, he stayed out of politics entirely, believing nonprofits could not engage in such activity.
However, Shore realized staying neutral was detrimental to the organization’s goals. He highlights five actions his organization performs in the political sphere: They educate, build internal political capacity, receive consulting help, take a long-term approach and team up with others. 
As Shore suggests, nonprofits can form coalitions to hold representatives accountable, advocate for certain legislation changes, and push for voter registration. For other organizations, advocacy is as simple as posting a statement showing support for a social movement. 
If politics and laws do not match their efforts, an organization cannot enact sustained change. For example, if a public education nonprofit does not participate in tangible action to change policies that create inequalities in education, what impact are they making? Omitting policy change from the agenda makes a nonprofit reactionary, rather than a tool to address the root of a problem. While nonprofits are a separate entity from the government, the two go hand-in-hand. Without the government, nonprofits operate in a closed ecosystem, incapable of addressing broad structural issues.
At a time of increasing politicization, a squeamish attitude toward politics is nonsensical. While politicization certainly occurred before the election of former President Donald Trump, his response to the coronavirus, the Black Lives Matter movement and climate change ignited further divide around topics that should not cause controversy. For example, a Brookings study found partisan affiliation to be the strongest indicator of behavior toward the pandemic. According to Pew Research, in September 2020, 16% of white Republicans supported the Black Lives Matter Movement, compared to 88% of white Democrats. Most hot-button issues are split along party lines when they shouldn’t be. 
It’s a harsh truth for this day and age: If nonprofits refuse to speak up about politics, most causes and issues would be considered off-limits. With partisanship infiltrating every aspect of daily life, a completely hands-off approach from politics would drastically reduce nonprofits’ capacity to work. By refusing to get involved with politics, nonprofits forfeit their voice and influence for important issues that should not be debated. 
I understand that political involvement scares nonprofit executives because it could alienate a donor on the other side of the political spectrum. But, by remaining neutral, many nonprofit organizations cannot fulfill their mission. If their mission is paramount, nonprofits should work to achieve that, regardless of pushback. If a donor stops funding because a nonprofit advocates for its clientele, that donor did not align with the organization’s values in the first place. 
When faced with an abundance of rules, nonprofits undoubtedly find it easier to keep a safe distance from politics. Some do not have the time to parse through laws that govern nonprofit activity to fully understand what’s allowed. However, by not taking the time to understand these laws, nonprofits harm the communities they serve through inaction and underutilize their role as an advocate. Nonprofits are tools for change and to be most effective at this role, they must speak up.
