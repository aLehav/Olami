Perhaps it was for the best that USC’s 41-28 loss to Utah was buried in the Los Angeles sports headlines on Saturday, with the Dodgers winning the pennant and a fight breaking out at LeBron James’ Lakers home debut. It deserved to be hidden on television on the Pac-12 Network and on radio — due to the Lakers game — on a country music station.
It wasn’t worth watching or listening to anyway.
The same, predictable things happened. The Trojans jumped out to a 14-0 lead, but not on the offense’s merits. The first touchdown, an ill-advised throw into double coverage from freshman quarterback JT Daniels to junior wide receiver Michael Pittman, should’ve been intercepted. The second was a defensive score.
Despite the early lead, at no point did the offense have a rhythm. At no point did Daniels look comfortable. At no point did this team, stacked with five-star recruits, look even slightly in control against a far-less talented Utah team. We’ve been over this, time and time again.
It was hardly a surprise when Utah came back, a la Texas. When USC failed to score on its final five possessions of the first half, it was already over. The halftime score read 20-14 in favor of Utah, but it felt like total domination.
In the end, it was. The Utes scored 34 unanswered points and racked up 541 total yards of offense, more than doubling USC’s 205 yards. The Trojans managed 73 yards on the ground and 132 yards in the air. They started the game 0-for-10 on third down conversions and possessed the ball for more than nine fewer minutes than the Utes.
Translation: not good.
“We hadn’t had a night like that since Alabama in ’16,” offensive coordinator Tee Martin said.
I was at AT&T Stadium two years ago for that rout, a 52-6 loss to open the 2016 season. I never thought I’d witness anything close to it again. But Saturday was, in fact, USC’s worst offensive performance since that game, when the Trojans recorded 194 yards of offense against the Crimson Tide.
In that game, with USC down big in the second half, a backup redshirt freshman quarterback by the name of Sam Darnold saw his first action in garbage time. It wasn’t long before he took over the team, and we took the quarterback position at USC for granted. It didn’t matter that the playcalling was suspect, or the defense slipped up, or something happened on special teams — Darnold cleaned up the mess for the next two seasons.
Now, with a true freshman at quarterback, USC no longer has that luxury. We’ve known this since the opener against UNLV, and especially after Weeks 2 and 3, when Daniels showed growing pains in losses at Texas and Stanford. It is Week 7, and he still hangs in the pocket too long, still throws off his back foot when he doesn’t need to.
But the losses aren’t on Daniels. Plenty of college football teams have freshman quarterbacks who are inexperienced and make mistakes in their debut seasons. That’s fine. That’s what happens when you trust an 18-year-old to run the offense.
Head coach Clay Helton said it himself in his postgame presser, so I won’t sound too accusatory: Blame the team’s shortcomings on him.
“I’m going to put everything on me, as far as performance,” Helton said. “My job as head coach is to make sure we’re performing at a high level, and we didn’t do go enough to win the football game.”
Step one is recognizing the problem. Helton did that.  Step two is solving it.
It starts with putting the quarterback in the best situation to succeed. That means establishing the run game so Daniels is not forced to throw the ball on third-and-long. It is incredible that with three stellar running backs, USC’s rushing attack is still inconsistent and failed to hit 100 yards against a Utah defense that played a Cover 2 formation — which invites the offense to run the ball or throw for short gains — for much of the night. Not only did the Utes clamp down on Daniels’ pass attempts, but they also shut down the run.
“We hit it up a couple times [on the ground], but not consistently enough to take them out of Cover 2 and we weren’t running it consistently enough [for Utah to] feel like they needed to change,” Martin said.
That responsibility — calling the plays, making in-game adjustments — rests on the shoulders of the coaching staff. Week in and week out, this team has far too much talent for play-calling to drag everything down. This team is too good to not be in control of the Pac-12 South.
But that’s where we are. If, for some reason, you didn’t want to watch the Dodgers or Lakers on Saturday and flipped over to USC football, you saw exactly what has plagued this team all season long. And as the mediocrity drags on for the remainder of this season, one can’t help but wonder what the tipping point is for the people in charge at Heritage Hall.

Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier collected 19 kills and 13 digs against Washington State on Oct. 19 to record her eighth double-double of the season. USC ended up losing to the Cougars. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The No. 14 USC women’s volleyball team was defeated by No. 23 Washington State Friday 3-2 in Pullman, Wash.
The Cougars staged a comeback in the fifth set, returning from a 12-8 deficit to win 18-16 and outlast the Trojans. After dropping the first set 25-16, the Trojans bounced back and took the second set 25-21. USC fell behind again, dropping the third set 25-23, but again tied it up with a victory in the fourth set by the same score. 
Outside hitters junior Khalia Lanier and sophomore Brooke Botkin led the Trojans with 19 and 17 kills, respectively. It was Cougar senior outside hitter McKenna Woodford who proved to be a problem all night for the Trojans, with 23 kills — 9 more than the Cougars’ next leader, sophomore outside hitter Penny Tusa.
“[Woodford is] just more physical,” head coach Brent Crouch said after the game. “We had a matchup going [into] the first set that wasn’t a good matchup; we had our setter blocking her. That was not a good way to start, so that first set went the way it did.”
Woodford had six kills in the first set as the Cougars hit .333.
Despite changing up the matchup on Woodford after the first set, USC was unable to stop her.
“Then we matched up [junior outside hitter] Emily Baptista on her, and she did a really nice job,” Crouch said. “But there’s just a physical difference. [Baptista is] six-foot-one and McKenna is six-foot-five. She took some good high swings at the end of the game.”
Crouch said Washington State threw USC some challenges throughout the game that were difficult to adjust to.
“They’ve got some good middles, and their right-side player is a converted middle, so they were running a lot of interesting, quick slide combination plays that [are] hard to run unless you’ve got a bunch of middles on the court [at] the same time,” Crouch said. “When they passed up to the net they were really tough to deal with, and they ran some patterns that were difficult. It was hard to read, and that was a new challenge for us.”
The match was the Trojans’ fourth in seven days — their third different city in the last week — and their third in a row against a ranked opponent. 
“It’d be hard to say [fatigue] wasn’t a factor, but it wasn’t obvious watching. The effort level was there, the energy level was there, but we had a bunch of errors and sometimes that’s an indication of being tired,” Crouch said.
Along with fatigue, Crouch attributed the team’s errors to a lack of practice time, due to the heavy schedule the past few days.  
“We haven’t had a chance to practice much the last week because of all these games in a row and traveling, and we’re trying to keep them healthy,” Crouch said. “I thought our offense was not running really well tonight, and we just haven’t practiced it.”
USC’s schedule will lighten up from here. The Trojans don’t have another match until Friday, and Crouch is looking forward to using the upcoming off week to get his team rolling again.
“We need to dial the offense back in this coming week,” Crouch said. “It’s great we’ve got four days of practice in a row before we play on Friday.”
But not all was lost for the Trojans in Friday’s effort, according to Crouch.
“At times, especially in the second through the fourth set, we were serving as well as I’ve ever seen us serve — just really tough serves,” Crouch said. “Those ones that we missed at the end, I think we were just a little jacked up, we were hitting them long.”
The Trojans look to build on these strengths in their off week and come out fresh on Friday for a home game at 7 p.m. against Stanford.

Although USC Village offers a wide range of dining options, they seem to all share one factor in common: a high cost. While USC Village may be convenient, students often choose to eat elsewhere because of the lack of affordable options. However, amid overpriced salads, sandwiches and more, there are still a few lunch options under $10 (with tax!).
1. Mini Pita and Soup – Cava – $8.50
For a more affordable option than a full Cava bowl, a mini pita is the perfect lunch. The combination meal allows customers to put toppings of their choice on Cava’s signature pita. This lunch option is rife with variety in both flavor and amount of food, as Cava’s farm-fresh toppings change daily. Customers have the following options for their pitas: three dips and spreads, one protein, unlimited toppings and one dressing. However, Cava offers a wide array of combinations between six dips and spreads, six proteins, 14 toppings and six dressings. The pita meal is also served with a cup of steaming, seasonal soup.
2. The Our Burger – Wahlburgers – $8.95
If you are looking for a heartier lunch, this burger may be the move. The ⅓ pound angus beef patty is a proprietary blend of brisket, short rib and chuck. In addition to the patty, the burger contains tomato, onion, government cheese, pickles and the restaurant’s signature house sauce. For further customization and flavor, customers can add free toppings to their burger, including fresh jalapeños, pickles, mustard sauce, buffalo sauce, barbeque sauce and chipotle mayo.
3. Shio or Soyu Chicken Ramen – Ramen KENJO – $9.00
A steaming hot bowl of ramen is the perfect lunch option for a cold day. Customers must first choose between the salty Shio broth or the soy sauce-based Soyu broth. Both chicken broth bases are served with slow-cooked chicken and corn. For extra flavor, the ramen is topped with pickled egg, bean sprouts, green onion, seaweed and sesame seeds.
4. Personal Pizza – Rance’s Pizza – Personal Pizza: Pan or Tavern Style – $8.99
Rance’s, which specializes in deep dish Chicago pizza, serves affordable personal pizzas, the perfect lunch size. Even better, this lunch special allows customers to choose between two different crust options: a thicker pan crust topped with chunky tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, and a thin crust, tavern-style pizza with smooth marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.
5. Cranberry Walnut Salad – Dulce – $8.75
Dulce’s cranberry walnut salad is a light and refreshing meal. A base of mixed greens and arugula is topped with avocado, fuji apples, walnuts, dried cranberries and parmigiano-reggiano cheese. A olive oil balsamic glaze drizzled over the salad complements these flavors well.
6. Premade wraps and salads – Trader Joe’s – Under $5
At Trader Joe’s, shoppers can choose between many premade salads and wraps for a delicious lunch. These meals cater to meat-lovers, vegetarians and vegans. Favorites include the Southwest Salad, which is a mix of black beans, corn, Cotija cheese and ranch dressing, as well as the Buffalo-Style chicken wrap. In this premade meal, spicy chicken, celery and blue cheese dressing are wrapped inside of a tomato tortilla.

Friends, family, colleagues, former flames: since social media took its place as a cultural stronghold, we have been living in the age of clout.
Throw out every preconceived notion or bar for talent you thought the entertainment industry required. We’re living in a time where anyone with a computer or smartphone and internet connection can upload content to build a brand through platforms like YouTube and Twitter.
Growing up, I always had the impression that talent stuck. But increasingly, branding and personality have become far more important for emerging artists and entertainers than talent and substance. We’ve all seen social media personalities shamelessly profit from teeth whitening machines, homogeneous beauty products and even music. 
In the music industry, the bar for entry has never been lower. Don’t get me wrong: it’a a good thing. Because of public forums like YouTube, SoundCloud and Bandcamp, amateur musicians now have multiple platforms to engage with millions of potential listeners. But there’s been a consequence to this almost limitless stream of free content. There’s about 50 feet worth of crap you have to dig through to find the good stuff. And often, the cream of the crop doesn’t rise to the top — the curdled bits find their way there instead.
Judging from artists like Lil Pump and Bhad Bhabie, who have carved out a lane for themselves and secured their own record deals, it’s more apparent than ever that clout outweighs talent in succeeding within the industry.
This year, Billboard nominated Bhad Bhabie alongside artists like Cardi B and Nicki Minaj for Best Female Rap Artist at the Billboard Music Awards. Admittedly, Cardi’s rise came from a similar position as a reality television and Instagram star-turned-rapper, but she’s since proven to be so much more than a one-hit wonder. Bhad Bhabie is a literal internet meme and Dr. Phil sensation-turned-rapper. One viral catchphrase and a few singles later, she’s capitalized on her moment in the ever-changing spotlight of the internet.
Lil Pump makes music built for memes. “Gucci Gang” and “I Love It” were destined for viral success, and for good reason. The songs were hilariously and unapologetically simplistic, self-aware and ignorant. And naturally, the internet ran with them, if only for a moment. Still, this has not stopped Lillian Pumpernickle from earning his place on festival lineups and the tour circuit.
Even Jake Paul — yes, that Jake Paul — found a way to crack the Billboard Hot 100 last year with “It’s Everyday Bro.” To date, the music video for the song has over 217 million views. And it’s a certified platinum record through the Recording Industry Association of America. 
Yet, we have no choice but to take this guy seriously. Paul is extremely popular with middle schoolers and preteens. And while it might be easy to dismiss his fans’ demographics, he’s proven to be an extremely profitable figure, and it’s only a matter of time before he signs a record deal similar to Bhad Bhabie’s. 
So who cares if  “It’s Everyday Bro” is the second-most disliked YouTube video of all time? Many of us cringed, but we still watched it. And at the end of the day, that’s all it takes for Paul to clown his way to the bank. He’s still selling hoodies and pay-per-view fights to middle school boys, and he’s still collecting views in his essentially untouchable vlogging career.
Also, I hate to admit it, but the adorable Mason Ramsey falls under this category as well. The cowboy hat and belt buckle-sporting 11-year-old made waves after a video of him yodeling in the middle of a Walmart went viral. I’m sorry, but you can’t expect me to sit here and tell you that songwriting chops allowed him to sign a deal with Atlantic Records — it was the meme!
At the same time, it’s not worth the energy to be upset over internet memes and clout chasers making music — at the end of the day, it’s an inevitable part of entertainment industry. What’s upsetting is the sheer volume of incredible work that’s released each year and goes unnoticed. Cutting-edge artists never see a fraction of what their talent and effort are worth, but again, that’s the reality of this industry. All we can do as music fans is sit back, enjoy the endless content at our fingertips and use our own platforms to support the artists we think create truly exceptional music.

Sunny Suljic (second from right) stars as Stevie, a 13-year-old navigating his troubled home life and the 1990s Los Angeles skate scene in Jonah Hill’s gritty directorial debut. The film was released on Friday. (Photo from IMDb)
Movies allow audiences to glean experience through another’s eyes, usually someone they would never be acquainted with otherwise. Jonah Hill’s directorial debut “Mid90s” immerses its audience in an atypical setting, one not glamorous enough for a big Hollywood blockbuster, but nonetheless captivating: mid-1990s skater culture. Hill, who also wrote the film, vehemently refused to make his skater protagonists monolithic, made up solely of curse words and alcohol; instead, he sheds light on their inner lives, revealing their personal motivations for skating. 
The movie presents a slice of Stevie’s (Sunny Siljic) life. He is a 13-year-old growing up with a single mother and an abusive older brother (his first scene consists of his brother violently shoving him out of his room and slamming him against a wall). Another early scene of a birthday dinner shows just how closed off this family is from one another. Hill skillfully constructs this scene with shots that never include two members in one frame, showing just how disconnected they are. 
Quietly fed up with his lack of acceptance at home, Stevie slowly assimilates into a group of four skaters. Never having touched a skateboard before, the 13-year-old spends countless hours practicing to little avail. Every fall marks another failure, but the moment he successfully lifts the board without falling, he rejoices as if he’s just won the lottery. 
Yet, falling is what Stevie seems to do most in “Mid90s.” He falls whenever he wants to prove to himself, to his brother and to his friends that he’s strong enough to handle things by himself. Falling becomes the film’s beat, marking Stevie’s ceaseless attempts to learn the ropes of skateboarding (and life) the hard way. 
Clocking in at a slim one hour and 24 minutes, “Mid90s” is a concise work. Minimal in dialogue, the film is not as concerned with conversations as it is with actions and the unspoken intentions behind them. Skating, the principal action, is not a mindless hobby for Stevie and his friends — it gives them a sense of freedom and belonging. Rarely putting this idea into words, the film instead transmits the feeling solely through sight and sound. 
Hill uses the story’s setting to the fullest, dousing the movie’s atmosphere with ’90s culture but abstaining from gratuitous nostalgia. Every emotional flourish comes with a crescendo in the poignant soundtrack. The music isn’t made up of the typical hits associated with the era. Instead, it’s rife with tracks like the liberating “Gyöngyhajú lány” by Hungarian rock band Omega, that may not be popular, but encapsulates exactly what the skaters are feeling as they do what they love. 
Several times throughout the film, Hill repeats a colorful long shot of the skaters coming down the center of a wide highway during golden hour — always backed by a ’90s tune, the shot exudes the romance every skater (in the film and in reality) has with liberating moments like these.
Every one of his friends is already going through painful trials by the time Stevie joins the group, but according to them, he’s the one who “takes the hardest hits out of anyone.” By never leaving Stevie’s side, Hill makes the audience hurt with every one of Stevie’s hard falls, rejoice with his few victories and absorb the liberating thrill of skateboarding.

In light of the sexual misconduct scandals that USC has been forced to address, the community has finally caught a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes at the University. However, while many of the larger, administrative issues have finally been made public, the University still refuses to exercise transparency and is keeping other aspects of campus life under wraps. In spite of the controversy surrounding former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, the University has been remarkably quiet about the number of sexual assault allegations that students report.
Since the beginning of the Fall 2018 semester, at least 11 sexual assaults have been reported to DPS, nearly all of them coming from students. DPS has also logged numerous harassment allegations, batteries and instances of obscene behavior in its daily crime and fire log. And let’s not forget, these are just the incidents that were actually reported. According to a 2013 report by the U.S. Department of Justice, only about 20 percent of female student victims report to law enforcement, and of those who don’t, only 4 percent report to bodies other than the police. This statistic excludes 76 percent of sexual assaults experienced by women in particular.
Still, 11 sexual offenses in only two months is a shockingly high number. While these incidents transpired right under the University’s nose and have been made public by DPS logs, the majority of students are unawareof their frequency.
It seems clear that the school should be more transparent about what really goes on within the student body. While the University has been forced to be more forthcoming with administrative information, it feels like these scandals are taking attention away from the myriad incidents affecting students on a more personal level. Sexual assault is not going away on USC’s campus, but it seems that the attention paid to it is.
Some will say that this is the way things have always been, and that sexual assault on campus is notorious for not being dealt with effectively or even taken seriously. Sadly, this is likely true. However, it’s all the more reason for universities like USC to address it. The University must accept the fact that sexual assault is still prevalent on campus, even when it is not the most newsworthy occurance, and encourage students to report incidents and take action to prevent assault in their peer groups.
Of the 80 percent of students who didn’t report their assault to law enforcement, 26 percent of college-aged females chose not to report their assault because they believed it was a personal matter. While this is a decision that belongs solely to the victim, it is imperative to reframe campus sexual assault as something that happens far more frequently than the University cares to admit; it’s necessary to take the conversation from the private to the public sphere, if people are willing. The University must provide victims of sexual assault with a more robust support system to rely on on-campus.
At the end of the day, students deserve to know what is happening close to campus weekly or even daily to their peers, whether or not it portrays the University in a positive light. The continued prevalence of sexual assault on campus is something that must be addressed, and cannot be left on the backburner due to other issues the University is dealing with.

Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
I always know something big happened when “climate change” ends up on Twitter’s trending topics list, and that’s exactly what happened on Oct. 8. Two weeks ago, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a huge report that painted a grim picture of the state of the environment and the drastic changes that the world must make to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The biggest takeaway from this report was that human society and energy use need to be fundamentally restructured within the next 12 years to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
IPCC’s latest report really didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know — it merely said it more clearly and more urgently. The part that made big headlines, however, was that Earth is already almost 1.5 degrees warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution. For many years, 1.5 degrees Celsius was considered the maximum amount of warming to not cause radical changes in weather and geography. This new report found that to halt global warming at 1.5 degrees, the world’s carbon dioxide emissions will have to fall by 45 percent in the next 12 years. 
There is no denying that the IPCC report is scary: It put climate change fears into all-too-clear terms, and gives plenty of reasons to worry about the state of our country, our world and our species. However, the responses that I’ve seen to this report, and to the fear that results from it, have been troubling. 
In the last two weeks, I have seen a flood of jokes about an impending apocalypse. Even before the IPCC report came out, this bleak viewpoint was gaining steam. Former advocates of fighting climate change, like British social scientist Mayer Hillman, have been quoted saying that “we’re doomed,” and that it is time to simply accept the world is becoming more and more uninhabitable, and that the work to undo the damage of climate change is so huge and difficult that we may as well give up, roll over and enjoy the earth while it lasts. 
Columnist Mike Pearl called this group “climate change edgelords” in a VICE article: the people who believe in the reality of climate change, but are quick to debunk every possible solution and see optimism around climate change as futile. I wish this went without saying, but climate change nihilism is just as bad, if not worse than climate change denialism. 
What’s so strange about these climate change edgelords is that they (generally) really do care about the environment. A lot of the people who I’ve seen throw up their hands at the IPCC numbers were once staunch advocates of doing all that could be done to slow down climate change. Perhaps seeing the effects of climate change in hard numbers, and realizing that the world is most likely going to become more than 1.5 degrees warmer, feels like a failure, and failure feels like a reason to give up. 
The reality is that the world may fail at stopping temperature rise at 1.5 degrees, but we must remember that controlled failure is far better than utterly giving up. If climate change levels off at 2 degrees, that will cause major changes, but it will be far better than a rise of 2.5 degrees. Addressing climate change is not a clear-cut issue, and though we may miss a crucial target, that is not a reason to say that optimism about the future of the planet is worthless. After all, the IPCC also found that if world keeps releasing carbon at its current rate, it will be 4.8 degrees warmer compared to preindustrial levels by 2100 — avoiding that future seems worth it to me. 
I am saying this as someone who has edgelordy tendencies around environmentalism; I am part of the few who believe a lot of the current policies used to tackle climate change are ineffective, that 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of fossil-fuel use and that your stainless steel reusable straw won’t do much to undo the damage of the economic and political systems that wrings Earth of its resources at an astonishing rate. 
I hate the form of environmentalism that tells consumers that global warming would disappear if we just turned off our lights or took shorter showers, and I think it’s archaic to place blame for environmental degradation on individuals, rather than the institutions that are actually doing damage. I fully accept that there is not much that I, as one individual, can do to stop climate change. But that does not mean I will give up.
In the face of statistics like those from the IPCC, it is very easy to surrender to the bleakness of it all. I hope that the IPCC’s report functions not as a reason to be paralyzed by fear, but as an impetus to change tactics. The situation is not ideal, but the things that we do now will impact the climate of the future.
The things we can do now include pivoting away from coal and fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and nuclear energy; investing in carbon capture technologies; limiting the energy use of transportation vehicles; and restoring ecosystems to the best of our ability. The most crucial step, though  — the one that I worry will be overlooked the most — will be to hold our institutions accountable. That means pushing huge corporations to reevaluate their business practices, and it also means electing public figures who care about the environment. If anything, the IPCC report showed the world that every tenth of a degree counts, so instead of wallowing in fear, it’s time to start acting like that.

Margarita Lopez was accepted to seven of the eight schools she applied to, including Columbia University and UCLA. She chose USC for its accommodating experience, networking opportunities and school spirit. (Mia Speier | Daily Trojan)
Margarita Lopez is not your typical junior. Though she attends classes, goes to office hours, spends time in the library and drinks too much coffee like every other student, Lopez, 58, is also a mother of eight. 
After earning her associate’s degree from Santa Monica College, Lopez transferred to USC this semester to pursue a degree in psychology at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
Lopez is the second of her 10 siblings to pursue a bachelor’s degree, and she doesn’t let the fact that she never attended high school stop her from chasing her higher education goals. 
Although Lopez admits that she often felt out of place when she arrived on campus, she credits her professors and advisors for making her feel welcome.
“I felt so out of place. [USC] is such a young campus,” Lopez said. “It’s like I’m a little fish in a big pond.” 
In addition to being a full-time student, Lopez is the caretaker for a large family and has seen many of her kids go off to college — like her daughter Milanca, who she said was her main motivation for going back to school. Milanca attended UC Berkeley and earned her sociology degree in five years, while raising a child.
Soon after celebrating her graduation, Lopez received terrifying news about her daughter the day before Mother’s Day. 
“We got a call at around six in the morning that something happened,” she said. “We found out that she was killed in a car accident six days after she graduated. And my grandson was with her, so they both were killed.” 
A few months after her funeral, Lopez discovered an email that Milanca had sent her about a year and a half before she died. In the message, Milanca encouraged Lopez to pursue higher education. 
“I never answered it,” Lopez said. “She was my biggest advocate. I must’ve ignored it … That made me think I need to do this to honor her. That was [my] motivation.” 
Lopez said that although she thought pursuing her passion for education might fill the void and help her cope with the loss of her daughter, it didn’t fully. Nevertheless, Lopez applied to eight schools and was accepted to seven of them, including Columbia University, UC Berkeley, UCLA and USC. Lopez said she chose USC for its accommodating experience, networking opportunities and school spirit. 
“[My family] motivates me. I want them to be proud of me,” Lopez said. 
Another motivating factor for Lopez is her 22-year-old son Emilio, with whom she enjoys sharing her academic success. Emilio has cerebral palsy, a disease that has left him quadriplegic and unable to communicate well.
“Everytime I get a good grade I always think that my brain is still working at 58 … and I have a son [who is] so smart, but his language is very limited,” Lopez said. “Every time I do well, it humbles me.” 
Lopez said, as someone who has had experiences with drugs and alcohol and abuse, she hopes that studying psychology will help her build a kinship with those who have had similar experiences. 
Between driving her kids to and from school and caring for her son, Lopez’s schedule is constantly packed. Nevertheless, she finds time during her busy days to come to campus for classes. 
“I feel like I understand how someone can get there,” Lopez said. “I can probably help other people.”
