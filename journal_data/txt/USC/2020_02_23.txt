When Chris Merkle retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in 2010, he struggled to overcome the lingering trauma of having served in Iraq and Afghanistan. While he met with a therapist regularly, Merkle found it difficult to share his overseas experience.
“I was not prepared or ready to deal with the trauma, so I just talked about surface-level problems,” Merkle said. 
His therapist recommended the Bravemind project, which uses virtual reality technology to treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients are outfitted with a head-mounted virtual display and led by a therapist through a stress-inducing war environment. Participants physically hold a rifle as they experience a simulation that includes booming explosions and even smells of burning debris. 
Dr. Albert Rizzo, director of Medical Virtual Reality at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, created the first prototype of the therapy program in 2004. He began developing the project after recognizing the urgency to address PTSD for service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a Research and Development Corporation study, nearly 20% of veterans returning from these conflicts report signs of PTSD. 
“If you take the best technology … to teach people how to fight the war, we should be using the best technology to help people recover from wars,” Rizzo said. 
Merkle credits the therapy program with helping him confront his trauma. 
“It really just fast-forwarded my recovery because I had to deal with it and process it, and then I would take [the headset] off and realize ‘OK, I’m still in the hospital, and I’m OK,’” Merkle said. 
Rizzo used the exposure therapy method to develop the project. Traditionally, PTSD patients in exposure therapy repeatedly recount a traumatic event in graphic detail to a clinician. This allows them to confront and emotionally reprocess harrowing memories. 
“If you help a patient to go back to the scene of the crime emotionally or mentally and do it repeatedly, while it’s anxiety-provoking at first, eventually, the anxiety starts to extinguish or dissipate,” Rizzo said. 
According to Rizzo, traditional exposure therapy has limits as therapists struggle to manage the patients’ imagination of a scenario. 
“Basically you’re asking someone who spent months, years, sometimes decades trying to avoid thinking about what we’re asking them to pull up and imagine in great detail,” Rizzo said. “We never know if they’re really doing it.” 
The Bravemind project offers a solution, exposing patients to a customized virtual experience that reflects the traumatic memory, Rizzo said. The current version includes 14 worlds for participants to choose from, including an Afghan village and Iraqi marketplace. 
Clinicians operate the patient’s experience from a control panel to personalize the virtual setting. As the patient describes a traumatic memory, the therapist can adjust the time of day or include specific sounds to trigger an anxiety-inducing response. 
Thomas Talbot began working as the medical expert for Bravemind in 2011. As a former army doctor, he emphasized the realism of the virtual scenarios. 
“It’s more than just looking at a picture,” Talbot said. “It’s something that you viscerally feel.”  
The original Bravemind prototype used art elements from the video game “Full Spectrum Warrior” to create a single-world system for soldiers on the ground in Iraq.
Following positive feedback overseas, the Office of Naval Research funded a clinical version of the system in 2005. Bravemind has since expanded to over 100 different clinical centers but is used primarily in veterans affairs hospitals and military bases. 
The project has received funding from Dell Computers, Intel, Samsung Electronics and the SoldierStrong Foundation. Talbot said he hopes to reduce the amount of equipment needed for treatment, making the system more accessible to clinicians. 
Brian Femminella, a sophomore majoring in political science and intelligence and cyber operations, will intern at the Bravemind project this summer. Femminella said he wants to collaborate with Rizzo to create an app that combines music therapy with VR technology. 
“We want to increase the exposure because some people are afraid to talk to counselors or are afraid to admit that they’re struggling,” Femminella said. 
Merkle highlighted the relevance of the Bravemind project for younger generations of veterans who are wary of traditional talk therapy. Their grasp of newer technology helps ease the pressure of a stressful therapeutic method. 
“It’s something that a lot of younger veterans are used to, playing video games and being well-versed in this [technology], and it’s backed by the elements of science,” Merkle said.

A dozen cinema and media studies students meet every other Friday afternoon to share their thoughts on films and social issues. The reading group, also known as CAMS reading group, launched in Fall 2019 in the School of Cinematic Arts’ Cinema and Media Studies division. 
Greg Ferrer, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, started the group to create a niche at USC for students interested in theoretical discussion. Ferrer said he was inspired by the small, informal discussion club at Pasadena City College, where he transferred from last year.
“I tried to start [this reading group] with the help of my professor, Aniko Imre, for just people in the department who weren’t so interested in film production,” Ferrer said. “I really wanted to find a kind of theory nerd community in the film school … I was kind of surprised that nothing like that existed over here.”
Imre, the director of undergraduate studies in the division of cinema and media studies, serves as the faculty mentor for the student-run reading group. She said the group consists of students with passion in cinematic theories and sociological concepts represented through films. 
“[Members] develop into very spontaneous discussions, they go into undiscovered and unanticipated directions,” Imre said. “They’re also often very open-minded-thinking creatures who are here because they want to meet like-minded movie nerds who live in this intersection of the social world and cinema and theory.”
Ferrer said he would listen to members’ advice when choosing the short articles or book chapters as reading material in order to let them guide the discussion.
“[Members] want to explore things that weren’t usually being assigned by the curriculum [of cinema and media studies],” Ferrer said. “I try to let the people in the group guide it. I’m always open to suggestions for reading. I don’t like to pick every one of them.” 
Imre said discussion topics are not confined to film and are inspired by readings on a wide range of topics, such as the influence of social media in pop culture. 
“These are fairly colloquial discussions about … issues that might be of particular interest to cinema students, such as surveillance, new technologies, social media but also capitalism and its alternatives,” Imre said.
Ferrer said members also said the group serves as a safe place to share thoughts and ideas on SCA, including the lack of research opportunities. 
“It’s interesting that [the reading group] also become a place … to discuss USC, to discuss the School of Cinematic Arts and just to get everybody’s perspective on this institution that we’re all part of but we don’t really talk about or share our views with everybody else,” Ferrer said.
Imre said she tries not to act like a teacher during the group meetings in order to give students freedom for spontaneous discussion.
“It’s a very egalitarian, very democratic group without the pressure of grades, without performance anxiety,” Imre said. “Everybody wants to be there because they just want to share.”
Unlike discussion sections common in USC courses, Imre said this seminar-like reading group offers students opportunities to shape the direction of the discussion.
“It’s kind of a training in educated conversation, keeping arguments in your hand, making sure the conversation doesn’t get so multi-structured and elusive that you lose sight of it,” Imre said. “It’s also a skill in moderating discussion.”
Imre said the fact that the CAMS reading group is outside of the SCA academic system is the main reason it attracts students to voluntarily devote their time to attend the organization’s discussions.
“Students in general yearn for something that’s not predetermined, that they don’t do for a certain purpose,” Imre said. “The reason why this club is a good idea and why it attracts people is precisely because the learning is for learning’s sake, [and] you can just be yourself.”
Imre said cinema and media studies students need to find their own tracks through taking different classes, since there is not a predetermined and specialized route for them, such as film production and screenwriting. Imre said this aligns with the core of the reading group.
“This club is really one of the epitomes for a major like [cinema and media studies],” Imre said. “It is truly a ‘build your own adventure.’ Students do this on their own — they volunteer their time, they pick the reading, they shape the discussion.” 
Imre said cinema and media studies students may have difficulty finding like-minded peers because the curriculum mostly consists of large, lecture-style classes. Thus, the reading group serves as a close-knit community for cinema and media studies students to make friends. 
“It’s not just about having intellectual conversations, it’s also about bonding,” Imre said. “It’s also about giving our students an opportunity to connect, which is much easier for screenwriting students, because they have small classes from the beginning.”
Lucy Allen, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, echoed Imre’s concern that there is less cohesion among cinema and media studies students. 
“I think a lot of people had the experience that it’s not super easy to meet other people in the major because we don’t have a lot of smaller classes that are major-specific,” Allen said. “This has been a cool way to connect people in a setting more like a seminar.”
Another member of the reading group Lukas Harrington, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, said he joined the CAMS reading group to make friends who share interests with him.
“Everyone always gets a chance to talk and share what they’re interested in,” Harrington said. “We really get to go all over the place and talk about politics and talk about film theory … and explore different perspectives on it.”
Ferrer said that as a transfer student, he felt isolated before starting this reading group, which offers him the opportunities to have small-group discussion as he used to do in a city college. 
“Personally, USC can be kind of isolating, I think, and I wasn’t really talking to anyone about [theoretical discussion about films],” Ferrer said. “I was excited to go to a place where I’d be able to have these kinds of discussions when I was in a city college, so I did my best to carve out that little niche.”

University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel opened a meeting of the school’s Board of Regents with an apology Thursday afternoon. Several former students had come forward claiming the late Dr. Robert E. Anderson, former director of the University Health Service and football team physician, had sexually abused them during his time at the school.
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said that, since the investigation was announced in 2018, 22 people have called a hotline to report Anderson’s inappropriate behavior during examinations. A former student reported that Anderson “dropped his pants and asked him to fondle his genitals” during a medical exam in the student’s senior year in the late 1960s, according to ABC 33/40.
It appears the University knew about Anderson’s misconduct  — most of which was directed at Michigan football players and wrestlers — and covered it up. Instead of firing Anderson when threatened by student reports, Michigan pressured him to step down as Director of Health in 1980. However, Anderson was allowed to stay on as a physician until 2003. Anderson died in 2008.
This is just one example of major sexual abuse scandals surrounding college athletic trainers in recent years. Michigan State paid a $500 million settlement to over 300 victims after physician Larry Nassar, who was also a team doctor for USA Gymnastics, pleaded guilty to charges of criminal sexual conduct and federal child pornography in 2018. In October 2019, Ohio State reported that former athletic trainer Dr. Richard Strauss committed at least 1,429 sexual assaults and 47 rapes during his 20-year tenure from the late 1970s through the 1990s.
In all of these cases, there was evidence that the university either knew about the inappropriate conduct and attempted to cover it up entirely or was slow to act. This is clearly an extremely concerning development, and it begs the question of how many other universities have allowed sexual predators to remain on athletic training staffs.
Schools can’t be trusted to self-report accurately because they have an interest in keeping such criminal activity under wraps. If they somehow managed to keep every victim quiet or get every report to slide through the cracks, they wouldn’t have to deal with the massive damage settlements seen in the Nassar case and sure to be doled out in the Strauss case.
There are two problems with this approach: First, it’s moronic to think that some victims would come forward believing the story would never come to light. Sexual assault is often a behavioral crime that predators repeatedly commit, so it’s a good bet that more than 22 former students will come forward in the Anderson case. There’s simply no way to hide that behavior forever.
Second, and obviously most important, allowing a known sexual abuser to continue treating student patients goes beyond the usual levels of evil. Enduring sexual assault is often the most traumatic experience of a person’s lifetime, and sweeping the reports under the rug is just about the most abhorrent behavior I can think of.
Universities hiding reports of sexual assault by physicians goes beyond athletic staffs. Most notably, a judge approved USC’s $215 million settlement with the patients of former gynecologist George Tyndall last month. This is a regular behavior in university administrations across the country, which is truly frightening.
Combining the regularity of such scandals with the fact that athletes have to work with trainers nearly every single day to stay in peak condition creates a full-blown crisis that calls for immediate action. That’s not to say that it’s less important when a non-athlete is abused, but being a team physician allows doctors to abuse many students who have to keep coming back for treatment. Universities must be held more accountable for their handling of student patient reports, especially when it comes to sexual abuse. 
Perhaps each university should be forced to turn over its patient complaints to an outside organization. That raises privacy concerns, but nothing will change while those holding physicians accountable are still on the university’s payroll. “Follow the money” is a saying in investigative journalism for a reason.
Universities also need to do more to make it clear to students that they need to report any inappropriate behavior they experience during examinations. A common thread throughout all of these scandals is students being unsure of what to do despite feeling violated. Schools must encourage and empower students to come forward with their stories because suffering in silence does nothing to address the issue and can be seriously harmful to a patient’s mental state.
The sports side of this is just one part of a larger issue. The number of people assaulted in any of these examples listed above is mind-boggling, and it’s only possible because university officials knew what was happening and let the abuser maintain their job. It’s sickening to even think about, but unless some sort of change is made, the lies and cover-ups will continue.

The USC men’s volleyball team fell in three straight sets to No. 2 Brigham Young University on the road Saturday. The loss drops the Trojans to 1-5 in conference play and 3-12 overall while BYU improves to 15-0, extending its lead in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
USC was competitive at the beginning of each set, but individual errors allowed the Cougars to go on runs that dug the Trojans into the ground by the 25th point.
In the first two sets, BYU established substantial leads at the 10-point marker by forcing multiple offensive errors on behalf of USC. By the end of the game, the Trojans logged 21 errors compared to BYU’s eight.
The Trojans went neck-and-neck with the Cougars in the third set, giving themselves a chance to take the match to four sets as they executed five kills that established a lead by the 16th point. However, missed serving opportunities allowed BYU to reclaim the lead and eventually the game, with USC logging three service errors in the last 11 plays. 
USC’s inconsistency could be attributed to BYU’s impressive serves and the Trojans’ inability to return them. BYU junior opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez currently leads the NCAA with 42 aces on the season. The second-closest player, UCLA freshman setter Mads Kyed Jensen, has 30.
While Fernandez didn’t finish a point behind the service line this match, his sheer power alongside servers like sophomore opposite hitter Alex Ah Sue and senior outside hitter Zach Eschenberg threw USC out of system multiple times, forcing setting adjustments and throwing the offense out of its normal position. While USC has capable hitters and adequate setter coverage, not being able to set up plays proved to be detrimental in handling opponents with a deadly offense of their own.
“They are a tough serving team and that put us out of system quite a lot of times,” sophomore setter Jameson McKibbin said. “And granted, our out-of-system setting is pretty solid, [but] there comes a point in time where you can’t just be out of system that much.”
Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Billy Fauntleroy provided the Trojans’ strongest individual performance. For the fifth match of the season, Fauntleroy logged double-digit kills, collecting 14 in the three matches out of an overall 27 attacks. 
While proving an explosive force at the net, the production gap between his play and that of his teammates was substantial in this game. Freshman outside hitter Adam Flood seconded Fauntleroy’s performance with seven kills, but got only 16 looks overall. 
Having one player lead the entire team by double digits in production on the net suggests a lack of confidence in executing a diversified set of plays. Even though BYU’s top offensive performer, sophomore outside hitter Davide Gardini, finished with just nine kills in comparison, the team still outpaced the Trojans in total number of kills. Seven players logged multiple kills while USC had five. 
As USC looks forward to continued conference play with another ranked matchup next weekend against No. 3 UC Santa Barbara, the Trojans will have to prepare for another tough serving team and an offense that has the capability to dominate. If they want to prevent point runs that lead to irreconcilable leads, USC will have to limit errors and be able to finish multiple offensive routes.
“It just comes down to those one or two small plays that can just change the tables,” McKibbin said. “We just kind of fell short in the end. That’s just something we’re continually working on.”
USC will play UCSB at North Gym Saturday at 2 p.m.

The USC women’s basketball team went 1-1 during its Washington road trip, losing to Washington 75-66 Friday and defeating Washington State 66-60 Sunday. This evened the season series with the Huskies — whom the Trojans handled at Galen Center in January — while marking an undefeated season over the Cougars. 
The Huskies outpaced the Trojans’ offense right from the start. UW shot 54.5% from the field in the first half to establish a 40-30 lead. Freshman forward Alissa Pili proved key in chipping away at the deficit with 6 points in the third quarter to bring USC within 3 at 50-47.
However, UW’s sharp shooting prevented a full comeback by USC late in the fourth quarter. Washington senior guard Amber Melgoza, who led the Huskies with 25 points, drained two threes alongside two free throws to solidify an 11-point lead the Trojans could not recover from in the final minutes of the game.
Pili and sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell’s 32 combined points were not enough to make up for UW’s defensive effort that forced 18 points off of turnovers. With 39 rebounds in comparison to USC’s 21, the Huskies saw more offensive opportunities and second-chance points that allowed them to sustain their lead. 
“Right now we’re short handed and we don’t have a lot of height,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “All our big guards are all hurt — four of them. So we’re just going to have to show more grit and determination and compete.”
After the tough loss in Seattle, the Trojans had to turn around to head to Pullman to face the Cougars. USC shot better than its opponent this time, shooting 50% from the field in the first half to establish a solid 37-19 lead. 
The Cougars caught up in the second half, shooting 45.9% compared to the Trojans’ 36.4% as USC’s ball movement fell apart. WSU cut down a 20-point lead to within 5 with just 40 seconds remaining in the game, but two clutch free throws from freshman guard Endyia Rogers helped USC fend off the comeback to finish the road trip with a win. 
Pili again was the anchor for the Trojans, scoring nearly half of the team’s 66 points with a career-high 32 and securing 12 rebounds as well. No other Trojan scored more than 8 points in the game. After this weekend, her double-digit points streak continues to 12 games and her average rises to 15.6 points per game. Pili is now eighth in scoring in the Pac-12.
As a winner of three of the past five Pac-12 Freshman of the Week awards, Pili is on track to be a force in the last games of the regular season and the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament and has a solid shot to earn the 2020 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year title.
This final road stretch also tested the capability of a curtailed roster with only eight of Trakh’s players available due to an injury-plagued bench. Freshmen guards Kyra White and Alyson Miura saw some added playing time, with White going for a career-high 8 points and Miura contributing 3.
“It was a good opportunity for me today,” White said. “I knew I had a big job guarding their best player on their team and just coming in and being confident with myself and my game, knowing what I can do and just filling some big shoes.”
The Trojans return to Galen Center next week for their final two conference games against Utah and Colorado.

Between those ubiquitous orange boxes and countless gossip articles speculating that the gifting marked the end of a legendary feud between Kim Kardashian West and Beyoncé, the clothing line skyrocketed to commercial success almost immediately.
But does Kardashian West need free clothes? Scroll through her Instagram feed and you’ll find nary an outfit repeated. Between her clothing line, her family’s clothing lines, free clothes she receives such as the Adidas x Ivy Park Collection and clothes she buys herself, she may very well be able to dress herself into oblivion without ever repeating a single item.
So I ask: Why does Kim Kardashian West need free clothes?
She doesn’t. Period, full stop, end the story here. 
Let’s forget Kardashian West for a moment and consider the average American. A 2018 survey by relocation and removals company Movinga found that 82% of the clothes Americans buy remain unworn. Moreover, each American throws away 70 pounds of clothing and other textiles every year on average. 
Now let’s consider that Kardashian West’s net worth of $370 million is 5,375 times larger than the average American’s whose net worth of $68,828. Based on this basic math, it’s safe to assume that Kardashian West has a much larger wardrobe than the average American and, consequently, a much larger textile-specific carbon footprint.
Climate change’s greatest villains, the 100 companies responsible for more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, dwarf Kardashian West’s individual carbon footprint, but her impact is so much greater than the sum of her individual habits.
The conspicuous consumption and consumerist tendencies that Kardashian West demonstrates don’t stop with her. Fans feel compelled to replicate these habits within their own lifestyle, often turning to highly unethical and environmentally toxic fast fashion companies like Forever 21 or H&M to achieve the same wardrobe critical mass that Kardashian West demonstrates with such ease.
This flippant attitude is prevalent throughout the lifestyles celebrities broadcast on their social media. Peruse Kardashian West’s Instagram story or an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and you’ll find her and her sisters drinking from single-use plastic water bottles. Reusable water bottles are probably the most ubiquitous aspect of America’s burgeoning eco-conscious culture, yet plastic water bottles still litter the social media of celebrities like the Kardashians.
There is a real irony of affordability here because unlike the Kardashians, who could literally fashion their own reusable bottles made out of diamonds, the average consumer cannot afford eco-friendly reusable products. A roll of Glad plastic wrap costs $2.98 at Walmart. An environmentally conscious consumer can choose reusable beeswax to keep their food fresh, but it’ll set them back $20.
At the beginning of January, Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, became the new face of Smart Water, the Coca-Cola-owned plastic water bottle brand. Gadot announced this collaboration on Instagram, emphasizing her enthusiasm for Coca-Cola’s commitment to sustainability and commitment to make their plastic bottles 100% recyclable.
In previous interviews, Gadot described how important sustainability is to her. She intentionally models sustainable behaviors to her daughters, teaching them to recycle, not to use plastic bags and not to travel in private jets, so why did she partner with a company that is the world’s biggest plastic polluter? Coca-Cola produces over 3 million tons of plastic packaging every year. Surely, she could have partnered with S’well or Hydro Flask instead.
Gadot might try to model sustainable behaviors for her daughters, but she sure isn’t for her millions of followers. This is the paradox of celebrity in the year 2020. These giants of popular culture espouse the gospel of environmentalism but continue to lead deeply unethical and environmentally fraught lives despite their considerable financial means, tacitly encouraging their fans to follow their bad example.
As environmentalism cements itself as a mainstream trend, celebrities’ behaviors have begun to shift. The 2020 BAFTA Awards asked guests to dress “sustainably.” Duchess Kate Middleton fulfilled this request by wearing a dress from 2012, but it’s not enough.
As consumers of celebrity culture, we can push for change. We can reject the need to buy and buy and buy until our closets explode with clothing, tags still on. We can shame behavior instead of rewarding it. Kim and her sister Kourtney recently both promised to give up single-use plastic water bottles after backlash from fans.
At the end of the day, the celebrities we love are themselves products, packaged and sold to us through social media. We are the consumers, and we have the power to stop buying into these celebrities and their bad habits. Vote with your dollars, or in this case, your Instagram likes.

As the spring semester progresses and students settle into a routine, emails about mandatory academic advisement meetings roll in. Class registration waits for no one — despite the summer break in between semesters, students’ registration times and dates will soon be released and thus begins the arduous process of schedule building.
It’s a semesterly saga — mixing and matching class, lab and discussion sections, trying to avoid the dreaded Monday 8 a.m. and, if the stars align, having no class on Fridays. Students are often willing to compromise on classes, choosing general education courses and elective requirements that best fit their busy schedules, but as they become more serious about their plans, post graduation, they inevitably want to take the classes that best fit their interests and career goals. 
To combat this, USC should offer a comprehensive, school-wide syllabus bank where students can look up syllabuses for professors or classes they’re considering taking in the future. Not only will it help students make smarter decisions about the weight of their course load, but it can also help them pick courses or instructors more relevant to industries that they’re interested in learning more about. USC prides itself on preparing students for careers and paves the way with job and internship opportunities early, so why not make it easier for students to connect with and learn from professors in their field of choice and have more knowledge when choosing their elective and major requirements? 
The element of surprise when starting a new semester is beneficial for no one. While it’s unrealistic to think that every single class will be of utmost interest to students, the mountain of classwork and projects is much more bearable when students are intellectually engaged. The same is true for professors — to teach a class full of students that want to be there and are eager to learn is significantly more satisfying than trying to wake up a sleepy, half-empty lecture hall. 
USG senators Ben Rosenthal, Emily Johnson and Randi Anderson are currently surveying undergraduate students about whether they think a syllabus bank would be beneficial. So far, an overwhelming consensus agrees that having a syllabus bank will help better inform them when selecting classes and would help them plan their own academic and personal calendars. 
USG senators are hoping to get their syllabus survey results approved by the Academic Senate, and then partner with IT Services to begin building the database. While USC has yet to start the process of creating a digitized, open-access syllabus bank, other universities have found success building them. 
In 2018, Duke University’s undergraduate student government has created a cloud-based syllabus bank, organized into folders by class subject. Accessible to current faculty members and students, it’s been a collaborative effort by the students to send in the past semester’s syllabuses and slowly grow the collection. 
Our USG is proposing that professors themselves send in syllabuses from the past semester, so students will have an accurate idea of what they’re getting themselves into, and can plan accordingly. Rosenthal aims to implement the bank as soon as possible, so that during upcoming registration students will have access to important dates ahead of time. 
It will take time to compile a thorough archive of recent course offerings, but the collaboration of faculty, staff and students on this project is fully worth the time spent for all parties involved. A digital syllabus bank will help USC students find better-fitting classes, create more manageable schedules, improve student attendance and only further stimulate and improve academic performance.

For the modern-day conscious consumer, buying secondhand is an increasingly attractive prospect. Fashion production takes a heavy toll on our environment, and many people are instead opting to shop vintage rather than contributing to the highly demanding and wasteful cycle of fast fashion. In response, a spate of “re-commerce” platforms have popped up in recent years, each catering to a certain type of shopper with distinct tastes. 
If you’re eager to jump into the online thrifting sphere but you’re not quite sure how to start, have no fear! Here’s a handy guide to what you can expect from each site:
ThredUp
 If you’ve ever watched a YouTube video from a fashion or lifestyle vlogger, there’s a good chance you’ve seen them plug thredUP, as the company seems to generously allocate its sponsorship funds. However, just because your favorite YouTuber got paid to sing their praises doesn’t mean thredUP is your best bet when it comes to buying secondhand. thredUP bills itself as the “largest online consignment and thrift store” so they’re not discerning and accept whatever gets sent to them. They’re basically a digital Goodwill. You might get lucky and stumble upon a hidden gem, but only after sifting through tons of graphic T-shirts, polyester blouses and wrinkled tank tops. Plus, thredUP has been plagued by a multitude of scamming accusations from both sellers and buyers, so thrift at your own risk!
Poshmark
If thredUP is the equivalent of Goodwill, then Poshmark is the equivalent of Crossroads or Buffalo Exchange — marginally more organized and slightly higher caliber. In 2017, Poshmark claimed that one in 100 fashion items purchased in the U.S. are resold on its site, and you can find some nice items on there, from Levi’s to Lilly Pulitzer. A word to the wise: many sellers on Poshmark cross-pollinate, uploading identical listings on their Etsy or Depop accounts, so make sure the item you’re eyeing is still available before you hit “buy now.”
Etsy
Etsy holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I started thrifting. Along with eBay, Etsy is one of the OG resell sites. I think of the myriad vintage stores on Etsy as a parallel to small, independent brick-and-mortar thrift stores. Each seller curates their offerings based on their own sense of style, creating a much more aesthetically cohesive collection. Etsy’s seller demographic skews older than Depop’s, so expect a slightly more sophisticated fare. You won’t find a ton of “edgy” or “trendy” clothes, but you’ll find lots of good, solid, dependable basics: jackets, sweaters, trousers and the like for very reasonable prices.
Depop
Depop is the hottest thing in thrifting right now. Maisie Williams, Madison Beer and Megan Thee Stallion are just a few of the celebrities who hopped on the peer-to-peer shopping app. In typical “keeping up with the kids” fashion, The Cut and The Atlantic both ran fawning profiles of Depop, which is simply crawling with Gen-Zers. Indicative of Depop’s younger-skewing demographic, to the app’s top searches are Urban Outfitters, Brandy Melville, Dr. Martens and Air Force 1s. Like Instagram, the app’s layout is optimized for your phone; the desktop interface is clunky and unintuitive. I find myself spending more and more time on Depop these days, just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling past teens in baggy jeans and plaid skirts tagged with #Y2K and #90sstyle.
Grailed
Grailed is the place for buying secondhand streetwear. If you’re looking for products from Supreme, Palace, Off-White or Raf Simons, you’ve come to the right place. You can also find lots of luxury labels that have cozied up with streetwear, such as Gucci, Balenciaga and Louis Vuitton. And for sneakerheads, new listings from Nike, Adidas and Yeezy are added every minute. The Grailed community is, unsurprisingly, composed of mostly men, but in 2017, the company established a sister site, Heroine, for female streetwear enthusiasts. I’m happy to say that my streetwear days are behind me, but I’ll cop to skimming both sites every once in a while if I’m looking for good denim or a high-quality hoodie.
The Real Real
The Real Real is a bougie thredUP. Both are consignment platforms, where the company acts as a middleman between the buyers and sellers, as opposed to the other platforms, which operate on a peer-to -peer system. The Real Real, however, deals in luxury goods, and thus employs authenticators to ensure that no counterfeits are slipping through the cracks — pretty imperative when secondhand Cartier, Chanel and Fendi can still run you four figures. I don’t make a habit of shopping on The Real Real — after all, pre-owned luxury is still luxury — but I’ll poke around when I’m in the market for a really good investment piece.
This is by no means a comprehensive list, and I can already name a few off the top of my head that I’ve left off. These are just the platforms that I’ve spent some time browsing and have the most experience with. Now, go forth and thrift!

Through photography, Domia Edwards has found a comfortable place to share her perspective on uncomfortable issues. The artist uses her photographs as a way to open up discussions on causes she personally believes in, such as increased representation of African Americans.
Edwards’ art is mostly personal, as she incorporates fights that she considers worth fighting for. There is also a motif of water present in her artwork.
“The ocean has been a really repetitive thing in my work because it’s just this unending space of just uncertainty,” Edwards said. “I find the ocean so beautiful, and it’s been a comfort for me.” 
One of the main aspects of her photography is the effort she puts into making her models feel at ease. 
“I always try to make sure my subjects are comfortable with me having a camera, with me being in their space,” Edwards said. “Really immersing myself into that community, making sure they feel comfortable with me and I feel comfortable with them to be able to really capture what I feel like they are.” 
Edward, a senior majoring in art, has known she wanted to be an artist for as long as she can remember. Born and raised in Georgia, Edwards grew up as an active member of Camp Village, an after-school extracurricular program founded by her mother when she was 3 years old. 
“It was a really important thing to make sure that they would come each day and be excited that they would have something to do,” Edwards said. “Also, we tried to keep it enriching … Because a lot of the public schools in that neighborhood weren’t the best.” 
Over the last 17 years, the camp has served thousands of children between 5 and 18 years old.
“I think it had a huge influence on how I was raised and just being able to be around that type of education,” Edwards said. “I’m from the southwest of Atlanta, and it’s a pretty much all-Black part of the town. There wasn’t a lot of programming that was really all-encompassing for these young Black children in our neighborhood. We just grew and grew, bigger and bigger.”
Being raised in such an environment not only allowed Edwards to express her creative side but also nurtured her leadership skills at a young age.
“I became a counselor when I was 14,” Edwards said. “I started as a site director with my older sister but [when] she graduated college … more responsibility fell onto me.” 
After that, Edwards created the Junior Apprentice Program, designed for teenagers between 10 and 18 years old who are no longer excited about children’s activities. 
“Once they get to that age … children think they’re too old [for camp], so we wanted to push them and be like, ‘OK, if you’re too old for camp, you don’t want to be with the little kids, what do you want to do in your life?’” Edwards said.
Despite being away from her hometown and Camp Village for most of the year, Edwards manages to incorporate her history and personal causes into her art and school projects at USC. 
“My freshman year, I started this project that’s been continuously going throughout all my years here,” Edwards said. “I call it ‘Journey to Salvation,’ where I started more of an internal practice of documenting, just questioning being away from home, moving to college.”
After the Roski School of Art and Design awarded her the Macomber Travel Grant, she was able to travel to her mother’s hometown of Ardmore, Okla. as a continuation of “Journey to Salvation.” 
“That town raised four generations of my mother’s family,” Edwards said. “My great-great grandparents traveled from Georgia to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears, so representation is really important to me.’’ 
Representation is the subject of some of her other projects as well. During her freshman year, she worked on a piece called “Boys Don’t Cry,” in which she photographed three of her best friends at USC, aiming to expose a more controversial aspect of masculinity.
“Black men are really expected to act in a certain way,” Edwards said. “They’re not expected to do certain things and the tension on their masculinity is a lot tighter. I feel they don’t get to love as freely as they want to, even in friendships.” 
The photographs themselves were images of softness brought by the presence of the ocean, waves and flowers that showcased the sensitive side of masculinity. 
“People were really diving into really disbanding, ‘What can masculinity be like?’” Edwards said. “If we really just let the reigns loose, what can all the beautiful forms they can really manifest in? … To be able to see them and have such a free and loving friendship, and them having such a loving friendship with me was really inspiring.”
That affection shows through the other side too. Caleb Griffin, a senior majoring in art and one of Domia’s closest friends, was one of the models in “Boys Don’t Cry” and considers working with Edwards an experiment in mindfulness. 
“Our shoots are really casual even though sometimes they’re centered around weighted topics, but the casualness is a result of our friendship,’’ Griffin said. Our relationship is really special to me because we bounce ideas off of each other a lot and push each other to new different heights.”
Beyond her friendships, Edwards has left a mark on professors like Jennifer West, an associate professor of the practice of fine arts. West, who is internationally recognized for her explorations of materialism in film, was impressed by Edwards’ artistic productions when she taught her for the first time. 
“I first had her in a moving image film class—that’s where you shoot analog film—and she immediately made a very beautiful and intense piece about African American kids,” West said. “The images were incredibly well-shot and composed and it was very moving … Her work is very personal and that piece was a little bit more about larger notions of the world and her community and her specific point of view and experience.’’
West said Edwards’ unique perspective and artistic talent, makes her a major contribution to the USC community. Her photographic expertise or with thoughtful insights during discussions inspire her peers, West said.
“She holds a very strong and important role in the Roski community,” West said. 
Edwards has already established herself as a prominent photographer and artist, and although the future is uncertain, she believes she’s meant to give back to the world.
“I feel there’s no better way to really make an impact other than really investing in the future, and that’s our children,” Edwards said.
Edwards said she realizes that being an artist is not easy, but she is a strong believer that doing what one loves is absolutely worth doing.
“Art can be stressful and hard,” Edwards said. “You gotta love it. I love this … I dream about making art. I dream about making the world a better place … That’s my No. 1 mission.’’
