Fresh off a thrilling overtime victory over rival UCLA and a week of rest, the USC men’s basketball team will look for a second consecutive conference win against Washington State today at the Galen Center.
Last week, the Trojans (9-13, 4-5) let a 15-point lead over the Bruins dwindle, but held on in overtime with some clutch free throws to notch a 75-71 upset last Wednesday. The Cougars (11-11, 2-7), meanwhile, suffered two losses at home, with the most recent against Arizona ending in a double-digit deficit.
In the win, USC held the third-place Bruins to 38 percent shooting, well below their season average of 46.5 percent. Despite giving up the big second-half lead, interim USC head coach Bob Cantu was optimistic about the team’s performance.
“Our transition defense was really good,” Cantu said. “We got back on defense and didn’t give up easy baskets, so we’ve got to build to do the same thing against Washington State.”
The Trojans also look to build on their strong offensive production in conference play, which ranks fourth in points (averaging 70.2 per game) and third in field goal percentage (44.4 percent) among Pac-12 teams. In the game against UCLA, five players posted double-digit points, with senior guard Jio Fontan and senior forward Aaron Fuller leading the team with 15 each.
“Now we know how we need to play the rest of the season,” Fuller said. “So we need to take how we played [at UCLA] and keep it going.”
USC is now 2-3 under Cantu, with four of those five games decided by five points or fewer (including two games that went into overtime). The team continues to find itself in pressure situations, something Cantu believes will serve his team well heading down the stretch.
“It gives you experience whether you’re home or away, so when it happens again you’re prepared and you know what you’re going into,” Cantu said. “We try to practice these things and provide what I call pressure situations, but that’s the conference. Games are always really close.”
Thursday’s game kicks off the second half of Pac-12 play for the Trojans, who are tied for eighth with Colorado and are separated from three fifth-place teams by a single game.
“We’re just trying to finish strong and win as many games as we can and get the best seed that we can in the conference [tournament] coming up,” said senior forward Eric Wise, who scored 12 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bruins for his third double-double of the season.
With the extra down time following the Trojans’ UCLA victory, Cantu said the team was able to regain its energy and clean up some weaknesses. The Trojans specifically need to stay out of foul trouble heading into the next stretch of games; the team has tallied up 48 more fouls than its opponents in conference play on the season (186-138) and, consequently, have given up 49 more points, which are crucial for a team that has fallen into a habit of taking games down to the wire.
The Trojans will also keep an eye on Fontan, who was absent from practice Tuesday because he was in bed with the flu, according to Cantu.
Though Washington State has lost seven of its nine conference games this season, the Trojans need to focus on their second-half performance and make sure they play consistently down to the final buzzer if they want to secure a fifth conference win.
“We want to take it down to the last four minutes every game and execute and play with poise,” Cantu said. “If we can do that, we’ll have a good chance.”
Tipoff for Thursday’s game at the Galen Center is scheduled for 8:30 p.m.

When the dust finally settled on national signing day, there was plenty to talk about. Between watching ESPN’s all-day coverage and scrolling through thousands of Twitter posts, there was never a dull moment in tracking the decision-making process of the nation’s top high school football players.
National signing day has been in existence for decades, but never has there been an event that seems to be more suited for this generation than this ritual. Everyone wants up-to-the-second updates, and “winners” are declared immediately based on players who, for the most part, won’t get an opportunity to make an impact on their respective college teams for at least a couple of years.
But the action is always compelling, and this year was no exception. The biggest story of the day was the out-of-nowhere class that Ole Miss was able to haul in, headlined by the No. 1 player in the country, defensive end Robert Nkemdiche.
Though the Rebels were able to crack the top five, the No. 1-ranked class, according to ESPN, belonged to Alabama and head coach Nick Saban, who doesn’t appear to be satisfied with back-to-back national championships. Another “big winner” of the day was Ohio State, which, after posting an undefeated record last season during a one-year bowl ban, brought in a No. 3-ranked class headed by cornerback Eli Apple, the No. 11 player in the country.
Though pundits will argue for months about which school really had the best class, there is no disputing what the most bizarre story of the day was. That honor is bestowed upon running back Alex Collins of Plantation, Fla., who committed to Arkansas but was unable to sign his letter of intent after his mother confiscated the documents.
According to sources close to the situation, Collins’ mother was not exactly thrilled with the idea of her son leaving home, so she took off, letter of intent in hand. Without his mother’s signature, Collins’ letter of intent is not considered valid, meaning something is going to have to give in this intriguing mother-son stand-off.
Collins’ announcement came during the same broadcast that included the commitment of linebacker Reuben Foster to Alabama. Foster had committed to Auburn and announced his decommitment earlier this week, but not before getting a sizable tattoo of the Auburn logo on his right forearm, providing further evidence that the decision-making of high school aged students is sometimes unsound, to put it lightly.
Yes, it was a lively day to be sure. But noticeably absent from the headlines was USC’s 2013 class. Though it is still ranked a respectable No. 14 by ESPN, all the talk seemed to revolve about players who spurned the Trojans, such as Kylie Fitts, Jalen Ramsey and Jason Hatcher. Combine the defectors with the fact that more than half of USC’s class has already enrolled in school, and there was little to be said of USC on this day.
But maybe this is a good thing. Consider that two seasons ago, the Trojans were barely able to crack the preseason rankings at No. 25 and ended the season at No. 6. Last year, the exact opposite happened. USC coach Lane Kiffin admitted recently that the hype surrounding his team had a negative effect on his players’ focus. Expectations have a funny way of impacting performance, and the enormity of last year’s high hopes proved to be too much to handle.
So what are Trojan fans to make of this less-than-heralded class? I say embrace it. Let other schools hog the headlines. That includes UCLA, whose class was ranked No. 12, two spots higher than USC’s. Or Notre Dame, who boasts the No. 4-ranked class after its national championship game appearance in January.
Blue-chip recruits are constantly told how great they are even before setting foot on a college football field. Maybe by being ignored in the national media, this small group of 13 new Trojans can help this team forget about the hype and get to work. The rally cry of “prep not hype” might not be applicable, but that certainly shouldn’t stop this group from doing all it can to reach the top of a different, more important poll in the future.
If they can do that, then they just might make a few headlines along the way.

National signing day has come and gone and, despite a few key defections, the Trojans have still racked up the No. 13 class in the entire country, according to Rivals.com. Though seven of the biggest hauls, including quarterback Max Browne and safety Su’a Cravens, are already enrolled at USC, the team was able to add six new players.
Looking ahead · USC coach Lane Kiffin addresses the media at the announcement of his 2013 recruiting class on Wednesday. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Lane Kiffin was excited to welcome them aboard.
“[It’s a] very exciting day for USC football as we welcome 13 new guys to our program,” Kiffin said. “The best way to describe these guys is sometimes, when you go big-game fishing, you’re not going to get a lot of them, but you’ll get some really, really big prizes. These guys, they’re the cream of the crop from around the country.”
Unfortunately, much of the news on Wednesday was about players choosing against USC. The Trojans had a number of players pick other schools after including USC in their final list of schools they were considering.
After weeks of speculation surrounding his surprising decommitment, USC lost out on defensive end Kylie Fitts, who decided to attend UCLA. Fitts had been pledged to USC for months and was seen as one of the 2013 class’ most solid commitments, but changed his mind after losing his early enrollment spot in January.
“I didn’t like [Fitts’ situation] at all, what happened,” Kiffin said. “We were 100 percent upfront with Kylie from the second of us knowing the situation. He had already signed his financial aid agreement to come here but, unfortunately, there wasn’t a spot for him. He’s a great kid with a great family, and now he’s across town, so really another good example of the situation that we’re put in.”
Perhaps the biggest shock of the day, though, was the decommitment of star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Ramsey, a long-time commit to USC, changed his mind Tuesday and will enroll at Florida State. In addition, defensive end Jason Hatcher of Louisville, Ky. reneged on his commitment and chose Kentucky.
With scholarship sanctions in effect until 2015, the Trojans are limited to just 15 spots for freshmen. Of those 15, the Trojans filled 13.
One of the negative effects the sanctions had on this year’s class was the lack of flexibility Kiffin and his staff had early on. Months ago, the number of verbal commitments USC had secured had already reached this year’s limit, so players who wanted to commit to the Trojans were unable to because of Kiffin’s fear of “over-booking” his class beyond its limits.
“It put us in a difficult situation, having the limited scholarships and the early commitments,” Kiffin said. “We were having kids calling us and wanting to commit and we couldn’t take them because we didn’t want to take more kids than we had spots for. That hurt us because, when you go back to those kids late, a lot of times they’re not there anymore.”
Despite losing out on a number of top prospects, Wednesday brought the official signings of several star players, including outside linebacker Quinton Powell and offensive lineman Nico Falah. A Florida native, Powell chose USC over Clemson and Florida, among others. Falah is from Bellflower, Calif., and chose USC over Arizona, Cal and Florida.
Joining them are running back Ty Isaac, wide receiver Steven Mitchell, offensive lineman Khaliel Rodgers and outside linebacker Michael Hutchings. Isaac, at five stars, is the highest ranked of the four, according to Rivals.com. A tailback from Chicago, Ill., Isaac ran for 1,220 yards in just eight games, averaging 10 yards per carry.
Mitchell attended Bishop Alemany High School in Mission Hills, Calif., while Rodgers hails from Maryland. Hutchings, who starred at powerhouse De La Salle in Northern California, had 56 tackles during the regular season, leading the Spartans to another state championship in the process.
Though the Trojans return 17 starters from the 2012 team, several players are expected to contribute early. Kiffin expects some of these new faces to start right away.
“We think that these players can come right away and help us, all of them,” Kiffin said. “Probably a couple of them will start. It’s not a ton of guys, but also I don’t feel like we reached either. Our 13 are better than anybody else’s top 13.”

These are not your average video games: there are no car chases, no battlefields and no farms. Instead, students play this game to learn.
Virtual · The “Life Underground” project will imitate the style of “Intimation,” a virtual world designed by graduate student Kyle Gorman. – Courtesy of Kyle Gorman
The Institute for Multimedia Literacy and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences teamed up with the Education and Public Outreach component of the NASA-funded project “Life Underground.”
The multimedia component corresponds to research being done at a NASA-funded center that looks at life in the Earth’s subsurface, micro-organisms that live in the ground, so that NASA might eventually use this project’s procedures on other planets and moons to determine if there is life outside Earth.
The multimedia project, which will be designed as a 3D game called Unity, seeks to encourage cognitive development through the use of interactive video games.
Holly Willis, the director of academic programs at IML, hopes the project can communicate NASA’s research in a way that will excite another generation about science.
“Communicating [NASA’s] scientific findings to a broad audience is one of the things they’re very committed to,” Willis said.
The project, designed for sixth grade students studying earth science, seeks to develop an understanding of microbial life systems that live underground on Earth and other planets.
“The project itself is investigating life deep underground in conditions that are very extreme,” Willis said.
IML will work with professors and undergraduate students across the university to study and research the changing nature of literacy across different media. The team is developing software that allows sixth graders to learn about microbial life systems by playing the role of either an underground microorganism or a scientific investigator.
The project, inspired by James Gee’s 2003 book What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, highlights the vital contribution that game-based learning has on education.
As a virtual microorganism, students can navigate a simulation of the subterranean world. “We hope that the virtual world will be deeply engaging and fun, while also being educational,” Willis said.
In addition to the 3D game, Willis said they also hope to launch an educational website including videos showcasing the team’s research. The project, which began in January, is expected to take three years to complete.
The scientific research that corresponds with the video game  will take place over the next five years. The center has a team of eight researchers from USC, CalTech, the Desert Research Institute and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The Dept. of Public Safety reported an increase in the number of thefts from parked vehicles on and off campus this semester.
Contrary to popular belief, many of these crimes occurred during broad daylight, according to DPS Crime Analyst and Crime Prevention Specialist Wyman Thomas.
Robbed · The Dept. of Public Safety reported that the most common method of theft was breaking the passenger windows of vehicles. — Alexander Harsono | Daily Trojan
“We’re talking during business hours, during the day when people are here,” Thomas said of the recent spike in burglaries.
Items that are visible from outside the car — most often portable GPS systems — have been most susceptible to theft, according to the reports. Other items, such as iPods and spare change left in cup holders of the front seat, have been tempting enough to trigger thieves to smash car windows or pry open doors to force entry, Wyman said.
Paige Garrett, a junior majoring in public relations who parks her car near campus weekly, said the recent thefts are a good reminder to maintain caution.
“It’s easy to forget that we’re not in the safest area,” Garrett said. “You don’t even think someone would want your GPS or spare change. But it’s a good lesson to remember for anywhere.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said such thefts can be easily avoided simply by taking extra precaution to ensure that valuables are kept out of sight or are removed from parked vehicles altogether.
“Many of these thefts could probably be prevented if the items were hidden,” Carlisle said. “[Thefts] can occur so quickly that it’s difficult to catch them, so what we want is the cooperation of the student body to not give them the opportunity.”
As a note of caution to students, DPS has come up with a slogan to remind students that thefts can be prevented: “Lock it, hide it, keep it.”
Though some streets off campus are lined with the security staff to help prevent crime, limited parking around campus forces many students to take the risk of parking on public streets that are not as well guarded. The most recent theft reports, however, indicate that no area of parking seems to be safer than another.
“It’s all over the place actually,” said Thomas, who noted that the primary method of break-ins has been by shattering the passenger-side window. “Mostly off-campus and west of Vermont Avenue, but sometimes on-campus also.”
In addition to vehicle crime, DPS has also noticed an increase in on-campus crimes — most commonly the theft of laptops from academic buildings, according to Thomas.
“We’ve had a spree of thefts in several buildings on campus,” Thomas said. “These are the same thieves. They are walking about through our buildings and they blend in with the student population.”
Carlisle urges students to refrain from leaving items such as laptops or backpacks unattended, even if they are in one’s dorm room, as strangers can easily enter and exit through an unlocked door in a matter of minutes.
“It only takes a moment for a thief, who may look very much like a student, maybe with a backpack and a USC hat or sweatshirt on, to grab the unattended laptop and put it in the backpack,” Carlisle said.
Though DPS can continue to bulk up on-campus security, thieves who blend in with the student body can be nearly impossible to catch. Given the widespread perimeters of campus and the surrounding area, DPS has been unable to capture any of the thefts on video.
According to DPS, the only fool-proof way to prevent theft is to deny thieves the chance.
“It’s as simple as not giving the thieves the opportunity,” Carlisle said. “Public safety is a shared responsibility. Don’t leave something out that is going to attract the attention of a crook.”

Tight end Junior Pomee faces five felony counts after Dept. of Public Safety officers arrested him last week on suspicion of possessing stolen electronics, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
Grand theft · Tight end Junior Pomee was arrested on suspicion of possessing stolen electronics. He pled not guilty Jan. 31 and is free on bail. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
Head coach Lane Kiffin told the Times that the redshirt freshman has been suspended “from all team activities until we get all the information.”
Pomee, who was arrested near 642 28-th St. on Jan. 29 at 2:45 a.m., was charged with burglary, grand theft and possession of stolen goods, officials told the paper.
A spokewoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney told the Times that Pomee pled not guilty on Jan. 31 and is free on $110,00 bail. His next court appearance is slated for Feb. 15.
DPS’ anonymous incident log from Jan. 29 includes an entry at 2:09 a.m. for “Theft-Grand” at the same address, which is reported in the entry as the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
“DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who passed out in an alley behind the location,” the entry said. “The student became combative when contacted by the officers and had to be physically subdued. The officers found the student in possession of a tablet computer and other property that did not belong to him and they subsequently determined that the items had been stolen.”
The log says the student was arrested and taken to the Los Angeles Police Department for booking. In addition, DPS referred the incident to Student Affairs.
Pomee was charged two days later for burglary, grand theft and three counts of receiving stolen goods — an iPad, an iPad Mini and iPhone 5, according to court records obtained by the Times.
Pomee, 21, did not catch a pass last season, though he often played on special teams.
‘’We were made aware of the situation last week,’’ Kiffin said, according to the Orange County Register. ‘’Immediately [upon] finding out, I suspended Junior from all team activities. He has not been a part of our team. We’ll get all the information in and let the process play out.’’

Christopher Dorner, a former Los Angeles Police Department officer, was named a suspect Wednesday in the double-homicide murder of Dept. of Public Safety officer Keith Lawrence, 27, and his fiancee Monica Quan, 28.
Law enforcement officials have not apprehended Dorner and do not know his whereabouts. Dorner is considered armed and dangerous.
Dorner was identified as a suspect at a news conference Wednesday evening, where Irvine Police Chief Dave Maggard declined to state a motive but noted police had uncovered a “multi-page manifesto” written by Dorner that suggested possible motivations for the slayings. Though police did not release any writings from the manifesto, excerpts posted by KTLA include references by Dorner to Monica Quan’s father, Randy Quan, as well as other LAPD officials. The LAPD fired Dorner after he made false statements against his field training officer several years ago, according to public records; it is believed that Randy Quan, along with the other officials named in the manifesto, sat on the review board that oversaw Dorner’s case, according to the Orange County Register.
The LAPD’s elite Metropolitan Division were sent to protect the others mentioned in Donner’s manifesto, according to City News Service. Dorner, who is six feet tall and approximately 270 pounds, was last seen in La Palma, Calif.
Lawrence and Monica Quan were found dead late Sunday night in his car in the parking garage of their apartment building in Irvine, Calif.
An autopsy completed on both victims determined the cause of death came from multiple gunshot wounds, according to KTLA. Police found no signs of attempted robbery. A joint burial is being planned for Lawrence and Monica Quan.
Both Lawrence and Quan attended and played basketball at Concordia University in Irvine. Quan had been an assistant basketball coach at Cal State Fullerton for the past two years, and Lawrence recently joined DPS in August 2012.

The two candidates for president of Undergraduate Student Government presented two visions at Wednesday’s debate: one of expanding and rejuvenating USG’s current structure and one of restructuring the organization to maximize efficiency.
Executive talk · Presidential candidates Matt Arkfeld and Christian Kurth vigorously debate the most effective way for USG to advocate for undergraduate student interests. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
 
Presidential candidate Christian Kurth, current USG director of university affairs, advocated for USG to use its current structure to better advocate for students, while  presidential candidate Matthew Arkfeld, current USG Senate speaker pro tempore, said USG will better advocate for undergraduate students interest by changing its internal structure.
“I believe what Kurth is offering to the table is really nothing new,” Arkfeld said. “I want everyone to think a little bit bigger. I believe that you did not do a sufficient job on behalf of the student body.”
Kurth said USG’s current mode of advocacy — surveying the student body on certain topics and bringing the results to administration — does bring about tangible results.
“One thing that I’ve noticed is how students don’t really understand how powerful their voice actually is,” Kurth said. “I really value the importance of surveys. Anytime you can get a survey with over 1,500 students or more, the university really does listen.”
Arkfeld, when asked if his one year of experience within USG was sufficient, said his activity as a senator, which includes co-sponsoring a resolution against raising tuition, shows his commitment to the student body.
“I believe that time is not really a measure; it’s more about action,” Arkfeld said. “I strongly believe that in this past year I’ve done a lot of action. In addition, as president of the student body, it’s about being in touch with the student body.”
Kurth, however, emphasized that his years of experience in USG have given him a better understanding of the organization’s role in the USC community and a better understanding of the operations of the university itself. When discussing the new security measures, he cited the effect of the Dept. of Public Safety’s efforts on both students and the surrounding community while also disagreeing with USC’s handling of the policy change.
“The people that are more happy about our security [in general] are actually the community around us — we have over 400 security programs that USC puts on to strengthen the community around us,” Kurth said. “What I do think, though, is that the university should have consulted the students better.”
Arkfeld said the community’s relationship with USC is a priority for him.
“It’s more important to move forward and develop a tight-knit community and break these barriers down to  foster a great relationship with the Greater USC area,” Arkfeld said. “I strongly believe that because community members cannot enter the campus … [is negatively affected and the measures are] not really doing what it’s set out to do – to make people feel safe.”
Students who attended the debate said that the debate gave them more information about the candidates’ platforms. Elli Hanson, a junior majoring in art, said that the debate helped her to understand the differences between the presidential tickets.
“I was really happy to be here because there were a lot of platform points that I heard from both sides that I didn’t really know just from pamphlets and stuff on Trousdale,” Hanson said. “I learned a lot at this debate.”
Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur moderated the debate. Schnur noted that the crowd of 150 students in attendance was the largest turnout he had ever witnessed at the annual debate.
“I was extremely impressed by both tickets,” Schnur said. “I’ve moderated these debates for five years and this is by far the largest turnout I’ve seen..”
Current USG President Mikey Geragos said he thought the candidates both did a good job of vigorously debating important issues, but wished more students came.
“There were a lot of students who seem to have already decided which candidate they will vote for at the event,” Geragos said. “I really hope students who have not made up their minds go online, watch clips of the debate and research the candidates before they cast their ballots.”

Despite another highly competitive match, the USC men’s volleyball team faltered once again in the second of its three-game road trip. The No. 10 Cal State Northridge Matadors overcame the Trojans in four sets, 25-17, 18-25, 25-21, 25-22, dropping them to a record of 2-4 on the season.
Road woes· With its loss to CSUN, USC saw its record in road games drop to 1-3. The team’s current three-game road trip wraps up on Friday. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
As has been the trend of late, USC looked sluggish out of the gate, hitting a dismal .077 in the first set. The Matadors took advantage of the Trojans’ slow start by racking up a hitting percentage of a blistering .611, including six kills by outside hitter Brandon Lebrock. After USC fell behind midway through the set, Cal State pulled ahead and an attacking error by sophomore setter Micah Christenson gave the Matadors the set 25-17.
USC was able to turn it around in the second set, riding an early 7-2 run to comfortable lead. Though the Matadors were able to keep pace for the rest of the set, they could not overcome USC’s early advantage. Thanks largely to the clutch play of redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jensen and sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers, who tallied a combined 10 hits, the Trojans were able to take their first, and only, set of the night.
“Going into the second I thought we showed some resolve and thought we executed really well,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We served a lot better, we passed a lot better and we just had a really good side out set.”
Though the momentum appeared to have swung in the Trojans’ favor, the Matadors were able to steal it right back. CSUN returned to its first set form for the rest of the match, hitting a combined .523 in the remaining sets. The attack was led, once again, by CSUN’s Lebrock as well as opposite John Baker, who combined for an impressive 40 kills and .557 hitting percentage on the night.
“We didn’t do a very good job blocking their two main guys, Lebrock and Baker,” Ferguson said. “We’ve had trouble against Baker in the past because he’s a little unorthodox in how he attacks the ball and he had a great match.”
The Matadors took down the Trojans with ease in the third set but faced a tougher challenge in the fourth. Though they had fallen behind once again, the Trojans were not to go down without a fight. The fourth set was highly contested and came down to a few crucial points at the end. Unfortunately, a late service error by Jensen cost USC the set and gave the Matadors the match in four.
“We need to just keep buckling down. Our guys can play volleyball, but we just haven’t been able to follow a game plan and be disciplined to it all the way through the match,” Ferguson said. “There’s some really good things where I think experience is going to pay off in the long run, but the process has been a little bit painful.”
The Trojan’s look to close out the road trip on a positive note with a match against Long Beach State tomorrow night. They return to the Galen Center next Thursday to face the Cal-Baptist Lancers.

“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.” So says author J.K. Rowling in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, the first installment of her best-selling Harry Potter series.
Though Rowling might be subtly referring to Harry’s future death and resurrection in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, she’s also commenting on the human fascination with death itself. Despite any fears we might have of the unknown, death holds a certain charm for us, one intensified by its ambiguity. What happens when we die? Do we exist in an alternate form or do we drift into nothingness? Between the pages of a novel, readers might get a few perspectives on these unanswerable questions.
The dilemma, however, arises when multiple interpretations of death and the afterlife begin to take shape. Literature has always been a medium through which authors express humanity’s innermost fears and desires, and nowhere are themes of death more varied than in books. And all of the haziness surrounding the meaning of death, it’s no surprise that writers churn out multiple explanations for what happens after the end of a human life.
In Gabrielle Zevin’s Elsewhere, for example, the afterworld finds a new identity in Elsewhere, a land where the deceased age backward until they reach the age of seven and are born again as babies on Earth. Here, death is a temporary state and serves as one big feedback loop, one where humans cycle through life, death and life again. Though the inhabitants of Elsewhere can watch the earthly world through “observation decks,” they remain permanently fixed in the afterlife, idly killing time until their rebirth.
In Zevin’s model, the afterlife also bears a striking resemblance to the contemporary world. Her characters find jobs, pursue romantic relationships and even lose their loved ones — though, this time around, the loss occurs when they return to Earth.
But perhaps it’s not so odd that our imaginings of the afterlife resemble earthly civilizations. If Zevin’s characters never cease to exist, then, in a certain sense, they never die. Instead, they are eternally reincarnated, traveling back and forth between two nearly identical worlds, suggesting that, for some writers, it’s difficult to imagine a sharp departure from earthly ways in an afterlife society.
Other authors, however, remain more intent on suspending their deceased characters between this world and the next. They portray these souls as ghosts or supernatural spirits who are unable to give up their attachment to their human lives. Audrey Niffenegger’s Her Fearful Symmetry and Alice Sebold’s The Lovely Bones follow this approach. In Symmetry, a middle-aged Aunt Elspeth dies of leukemia and haunts her London flat, observing her former lover, Robert, and her nieces Julia and Valentina as their ordinary lives go on without her.
Susie Salmon of Bones, on the other hand, finds her life cut tragically short when she is brutally raped and murdered by her twisted neighbor, George Harvey. As she inhabits her own personal heaven, Susie resentfully watches her family fall apart while trying to find her murderer.
Both Symmetry’s Aunt Elspeth and Bones’ Susie carefully watch over those they’ve let left behind but never manage to hold a permanent, satisfactory place on Earth, even when they return to Earth and inhabit someone else’s bodies. Once again, death proves somewhat flexible in these novels. These characters never completely leave Earth — at least, for Susie, until the very end — even as outside forces continually try to push them away.
But despite Zevin’s enchanting explanation of the afterworld or Sebold’s intensified connection between the dead and the living, the most basic take on the death mythos is also the most common: that of the man who does not die.
The Tuck family in Tuck Everlasting drinks from the spring in the woods and cannot die. The Tiger’s Wife’s protagonist, Natalia, encounters a “deathless man,” one cursed to wander the earth forever. Harry Potter’s Lord Voldemort splits his soul into seven pieces in an attempt to permanently cement his presence in the wizarding world. In the same series, a sorcerer’s stone guarantees its user eternal life. No matter how brilliant and luxurious an imagining of the afterlife might be, apparently, nothing beats staying alive forever.
Or does it? After all, these characters are generally miserable in their extended time on earth.
The Tuck family constantly moves from place to place to avoid being caught by a man in a yellow suit, a figure who hunts the family in a sinister attempt to market eternal life.
The exhausted deathless man in The Tiger’s Wife, meanwhile, understands that death is not something to be feared because there is the certainty of existence afterward — even if he cannot obtain it himself.
And any Harry Potter fan would be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t view Lord Voldemort’s antics as positively evil.
Even with these characters who escape death, at least temporarily, these authors seem to be showing us that eternal life is hardly a blessing.
“Don’t be afraid of death; be afraid of an unlived life,” writes Natalie Babbit in Tuck Everlasting. “You don’t have to live forever, you just have to live.”
So even with their varied takes on death and the afterlife, these authors remain certain that death is inevitable, uncertain and even, as Rowling put it, something of an adventure. They focus the reader on the impossible feats of their protagonists, assuring us that in the end it’s the quality, not the quantity, of life that remains the most important — even as we remain fascinated by what happens when it’s all over.

In 2002, the year Vivi Lynch graduated from USC’s Marshall School of Business, the corner of Hoover and Union streets looked to be a nearly unthinkable commercial destination. Now, the intersection’s retail complex, which houses the ever-popular wine bar Bacaro, has welcomed Lynch’s clothing boutique Kissa.
Selective style · Kissa’s Vivi Lynch and her team are conscious of selling clothing that students want to wear. They make it a point to sell student life essentials, such as sweaters, party attire and dressy tops. – Bernard Leed | Daily Trojan
Kissa, which opened last October, caters to USC women above all else. The clothing styles, the hours — most weekdays the boutique operates from 2 p.m. until 8 p.m. — and the prices all service the undergraduate lifestyle.
“I knew there was a need here that wasn’t being fulfilled,” said Lynch, who knows the plight of the fashion-forward USC student all too well. “I know how tough it is for girls to buy clothes. I wanted clothes, [but] I never had any money.”
Basics, such as colorful tank tops, can be purchased in pairs for $15. The boutique’s most expensive item at the moment is an $88 dress with thick-contour fabric. Some might call it a “special occasion” dress.
Those offerings might change by the time of your visit, though. Each piece is bought in limited numbers and fresh merchandise comes into the store every other week. Next month, Kissa could have almost entirely new inventory. Still, Lynch intends to keep everything under $100 and offer most pieces for much less. The styles will also remain consistent with college student needs.
“College students always want to wear the same thing,” Lynch said. “You want a really comfy sweater. You want a great dress or miniskirt to go to a party. You want a fun top that you can wear to class and then hopefully to the 2-9 afterward with you.”
A lot of these fun tops and great miniskirts come from Downtown Los Angeles, where Lynch and her team of two search for a combination of what’s trending and what inspires them in the moment.
“We don’t pick designers specifically,” Lynch said of her buying process. “We pick them for their clothes.”
The prices, the turnover and the styles will all remind shoppers of fast-fashion retailers, such as H&M and Forever 21, as will the disregard for “brands.” But accessibility isn’t the only thing that separates Kissa’s merchandise from the pack. The boutique also differs in its approach to the latest whims of fashion. Trends are curated and, as Lynch calls them, “intentional.”
“Every time you come in here you get a little bit of a theme,” Lynch said. “A few weeks ago we were doing this whole blue, blue, blue theme because we thought blue was really hot.”
A denim corset with a tulle skirt reflects this theme, as does a black minidress on one mannequin with a cascading blue hem. The latter is a favorite of Vanessa Waltz, Lynch’s partner in purchasing and Kissa’s graphic designer.
Lynch admits that there’s a lot of trend forecasting.
“We’re always looking at shows and magazines. We’re looking at everything,” Lynch said.
But trends aren’t what drive the merchandise.
The buyers are feeling edgy floral for spring. Indeed, this is already evident on a rack of yellow bustiers, splashed in floral print and hanging alongside a black pleated skirt that, if not leather, looks remarkably similar.
If the offerings sound very “downtown,” they largely are. Kissa won’t appeal to the college student who wears leggings and Ugg boots to class, but there is often a practicality (and comfort) to what the boutique stocks. Lynch’s current favorite piece is the one she happened to be wearing for her interview — a gray jersey tank with an attached tulle skirt that is both classroom- and bar-appropriate.
You could see the same look on almost any USC female, but it’s no real surprise. In the decade since she’s become a Trojan alumna, Lynch has worked in the L.A. fashion industry — she won’t say where — and has attended almost every USC football game. Her understanding of both worlds runs deep.
Accordingly, a lot of Kissa’s clothing has a similar versatility and ease to that gray dress. A sleeveless white button-up with silver tips attached to the collar would look equally appropriate for a class presentation as it would for a night out. There’s a playfulness to the designs, as well — many sweaters and T-shirts feature cut-out sleeves, cat prints (‘kissa’ means cat in Finnish) or some combination of the two. In short, the pieces look stylish on their own.
As Waltz said, “It’s not supposed to be stressful to wear clothing.”
The stress-free mantra extends to the shopping experience as a whole. The boutique is currently offering numerous deals through its website, ShopKissa.com, and offers free delivery within the 90007 area code. Lynch has also launched a membership club to provide loyal customers with in-the-know newsletters, early access to merchandise and, of course, discounts.
“I know that life is expensive. I want to make clothes fun,” Lynch said, her point punctuated by the sight of a smiling giraffe piñata behind her. “And affordable,” she added with a grin.

Curry College was right in its decision to not inform its students of a gang rape until six days later.
Alexa Youssefian | Daily Trojan
 
Curry College did its students a service by waiting for the three suspected aggressors to be arrested on Jan. 25 before notifying students of the assault. An informative email was sent on Monday, Jan. 28. Because of the weekend delay, the administration was suspected of suppressing the news and neglecting to warn the community about danger.
Some might feel scared at the notion that the administration was attempting to keep information from them, but one must take all of the facts into account. Gang rape is a brutal crime and the college has the job of protecting everyone at the school — including the victim. Catching the perpetrators is the first priority and the college’s response was completely appropriate for the circumstances.
Curry College properly waited to release factual information about the rape until the men accused of the crime were arrested so that students would not be misinformed. In this 24-hour news cycle, where information is released every minute on various online platforms, accuracy and truth become undervalued, allowing inaccurate information to flood the public. Hasty delivery of news often distorts correct information and compromises an institution’s credibility as a trustworthy news source.
It is better for the public to be well-informed than to quickly be given improper information, especially on a campus, where students depend mainly on the college’s news releases for information regarding safety.
Accuracy takes time, and Curry College administrators had to vet the email to ensure its quality and accuracy; thus, the email was delayed for several days. If there is no immediate threat, colleges should not frighten its students with emergency alerts.
Even if the email had been sent late on Friday or during the weekend, the college could have easily been suspected of releasing information when the community was least likely to be attentive to administrative releases.
It is also important to consider that Curry College ensured the community’s safety first by having the accused arrested, instead of preoccupying students with possibly inaccurate news, news that would not have given students enough information to be useful. Frances Jackson, the college’s spokeswoman, said Curry properly followed ongoing procedures of the city’s police force first and released a warning email to the community later, when danger had already been dissipated.
The college administration’s actions would have been far more worrisome if the suspects’ arrests had not been ensured, or even worse, if the crime had been hushed altogether without any information released.
Though speed of news delivery is important, it should not overcome the need for accuracy so that news sources can remain reliable. Colleges should be encouraged to take preventive and reactive measures toward public safety first and inform their communities shortly thereafter.

It is important to review the facts of the case to understand why Curry College’s actions were inappropriate. The attack upon a “highly intoxicated” student occurred on Jan. 20, according to The Boston Globe. The arrests were made on Jan. 25. Curry College’s dean, Maryellen Kiley, then reported the news via email on Jan. 28.
Curry College technically broke the law, as the Clery Act dictates that colleges must inform students of crimes that are considered a threat in a timely manner. And a gang rape is certainly a threat.
But what are the other implications of these violations?
Awareness is key to rape prevention, and Curry College’s actions impeded that. Informing the students immediately allows the community to be aware of sexual crimes perpetrated on campus and to take the steps necessary to protect themselves — whether that might be walking to places in groups or behaving safely at parties. An initial notification had no reason to include all details until the facts were gathered, but some effort to communicate the crime should have occurred instantaneously. Waiting nearly a week was an unacceptable approach to the situation.
And, in the time between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28, students could have mobilized to support other victims of sexual violence after learning about their campus assault. Waiting those six days makes it seem as if the college wants to minimize the event. Immediately informing students of the rape would have shown that the university acts immediately. Without informing students, this immediacy is lost, as is the likelihood of others spreading awareness.
At the end of the day, if individuals, schools and our community fail to take responsibility to stop violence against women, something must be done immediately. By keeping details of the assault quiet until the last minute, the college continued to perpetuate a vicious bystander culture — one in which sexual assault is kept quiet.
By relegating this sexual assault to the backburner, the college makes it appear as if reporting such a dangerous act is not pertinent to the students’ knowledge.
Society cannot accept these instances where women are treated as commodities to be abused and taken advantage of. Curry College made its mistake, and it is evident that other institutions should not follow suit. Otherwise, these actions jeopardize the security of students and the sanctity of womanhood.

Amidst the headlines of the Sunday Los Angeles Times, which included stories of fatal car accidents, sex scandals in the Catholic church, and the murder of prostitutes in downtown LA, one article stood out against the gloom and tragedy of the city’s news to let a glimmer of positivity into the mornings of the paper’s readers. The article was about gnomes – anonymously painted gnomes screwed into telephone poles, to be more precise.
Citizens of Cleveland Heights in Oakland have noticed the friendly artwork for months now, with the latest estimated count being over 2,300 different gnome sightings.
Pacific Gas & Electric, whose telephone poles are among those outfitted with the mythical creatures, experienced an explosion of online dissent when the company announced that it would remove the artwork from its property. After an intense Twitter campaign (#savethegnomes), the electric company’s spokesperson Jason King calmed the swelling resistance.
“We’ve declared the poles ‘gnome man’s land,’” he said.
In a metropolis that could certainly use a little cheer, residents of Cleveland Heights hope the gnomes will continue to brighten the day of sidewalk travelers.
