On Nov. 8, California voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized recreational marijuana and made it possible for individuals to grow and sell cannabis in the state. USC students Brian Zatulove, Zach Wise, Jordan Wise and Shaun Edalati quickly seized on the opportunity, launching a startup named Reefer that acts as a marketing suite for cannabis dispensaries. 
“Reefer focuses on two components: loyalty and referrals,” said Zatulove, a junior majoring in business administration. “We allow patients to earn points from their purchases and from the purchases of their friends. This essentially creates an incentivized social network around each dispensary that we are partnered with.”
Jordan Wise, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said that people who visit marijuana dispensaries can sign up for the service offered by Reefer. Due to the simplicity of the signup process, Reefer does not do any marketing.
“Once the patient inputs their phone number into our platform in-store, we send them a text leading them to the website, and they can complete their account from there,” Wise said. “The virality of the application does its own marketing.”
Zatulove said that his own illness built the foundations of Reefer’s business model. As a Crohn’s disease patient, Zatulove had early exposure to marijuana in a medical capacity, which helped him to understand the market. The high-tech startup class he took at USC worked as an impetus to transform his ideas into a reality. According to Zatulove, he and his team saw the potential in the fastest-growing industry in the country.
“I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease when I was 8 years old. I was sick in high school and had to choose between prescription painkillers and marijuana,” Zatulove said. “I chose marijuana, and this gave me the industry exposure I needed to recognize the fact that dispensaries have very limited ability to market themselves or make data-based decision. Reefer solves both of these pain points.”
Reefer recently launched a beta version with 10 marijuana dispensaries around Los Angeles, and is now in the process of making small product adjustments to improve the user experience, Wise said. He eventually hopes to get a Reefer tablet in every nearby dispensary.
“The beta [version] immediately gained a lot of traction, and the patients are loving it,” Wise said. “Our product is very unique, so we are focusing on proving the model and making the virality portion of the product work as smoothly as possible.”
Reefer recently received investment funding from Sidebench Studios, a firm that builds technology solutions for larger companies such as Facebook, Sony and Red Bull. Mike Lee, a senior lecturer in the digital entrepreneurship and enterprise systems program, is an adviser for Reefer, and said he is looking forward to seeing what the company can do. 
“It is always great to see students apply what they learn at USC to their new business ventures,” Lee said. “What is great about [the Reefer team] is that they have already shown traction at such an early stage with their beta customers. Their social approach to loyalty programs is a first in the rapidly expanding cannabis industry, and they have the potential to become the OpenTable of the cannabis industry.”
The national marijuana market is currently worth around $7 billion, and is expected to grow in the coming years. As a result, the Reefer team hopes to expand the company by operating in at least a quarter of Los Angeles’ several hundred dispensaries by the end of 2017. They also plan to expand nationwide within the next year.   
“We are currently at the forefront of what will be, very shortly, one of the largest industries in America, and we want to be part of that growth and sort of the pioneers of an industry that will change the country,” Wise said. “Obviously, we feel accomplished to get our product out there and have people using it, but right now, we are making very small paint strokes to what could be a very large painting, and we are trying to fill in the whole canvas.”

Students will experience changes to their housing options next year as the University works to accommodate an influx of students coming to live at the USC Village next fall. 
Sophomores will be given priority for Village housing, and will get to choose which of the themed Residential Colleges they would like to reside in, according to USC Director of Residential Education Emily Sandoval. Sandoval said that Bohnett College, which at this point is the most developed, will have a theme of social entrepreneurship, where students will work together to solve a problem they see in Los Angeles.
“When all the themed residential colleges will be set, not all the colleges will be around that theme,” Sandoval told students attending an open house on Friday. “Some of the faculty will do some of the programs that are connected to that theme. The themes are currently being decided by the Office of the President and the Provost.” 
The only freshman housing in the Village will be the McCarthy Honors College, which will house merit scholarship recipients. Those students are currently housed in Birnkrant Residential College, which will open up to non-scholarship recipients next fall. 
“About 530 first-year students will be housed — all of the Presidential, Mork and Trustee scholars,” Sandoval said.
The conversion of Birnkrant may present new opportunities for spring admits to obtain housing, according to Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Austin Dunn. But ensuring that spring admits get access to the Village may prove to be more challenging, Dunn said. As of now, the Village is not disclosing any details, though USG is making an effort to try to learn more.
“It’s hard to get into talks with the University Village.” Dunn said. “One of the branches of USG community affairs, the advocacy branch, is starting to develop a better relationship with the administrators with regards to housing.”
Another issue being addressed is the increase in residential assistants needed to accommodate the new housing. Sandoval said that there would be 50 RAs living in the Village, increasing the total number of RAs from 156 to 206 and making it more crucial than ever for students to apply.
All freshmen will be required to have a full meal plan, while sophomores would need at least an apartment plan, both of which would include access to the new dining hall being built in the Village.
Sandoval also addressed concerns about safety that could arise due to the presence of retail stores on the first floor of the residential buildings. 
“Just like the main campus, this area will lock down at 9 p.m.,” Sandoval said. “There is a guard shack, so anyone in the retail spaces will not be able to access the residential spaces. The bedrooms and apartments will be locked.”
Ensuring safety and promoting the open house is part of a campaign by USC Housing to push more students to apply for on-campus housing. In order to fill all of the new spaces, more students need to express an interest in living in USC housing than in previous years, Sandoval said.
USC Housing is also considering converting the Troy Hall Complex, which had formerly held upperclassmen, to graduate housing. The final decision will be made next semester depending on the demand once housing applications start coming in. If enough upperclassmen request to live in Webb Tower, they will be prioritized over freshmen to receive the open spots.
Correction: A previous version of this misspelled Bohnett College as Benet College. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
I am very interested in seeing how this University Village combines the needs of students as well as the community at large. The 9 pm curfew is an obvious admission from the University that it considers the neighborhood a dangerous  place after dark. Westwood does not have a curfew for UCLA.

USC football is back. If it wasn’t clear before Saturday, it is abundantly so now. There are a wide array of indicators one could point at to drive this point home. For one, commentators and analysts across the country are once again describing USC as the team no one wants to play at the end of the year. A more obvious reason would be USC playing a somewhat sloppy game and still racking up 500-plus yards of offense while thoroughly dismantling a talented crosstown rival.
Both of these factors should leave everyone in Trojan Nation happy, but I use another metric to truly gauge USC’s national relevance. For the first time since Mark Sanchez was quarterbacking a one-loss USC team in November of 2008, I actually care about what other nationally top-ranked teams are doing this late in the season.
For the last seven full seasons, USC has, for one reason or another, had no true national relevance in November in regards to the championship game or now playoff. Last Saturday, after the phenomenal Washington win, I started dreaming up scenarios in which USC could make an impromptu run to the playoff. That is how I know USC is finally back. While their chances of a playoff run are quite improbable, crazier things have happened.
Since Pete Carroll left Los Angeles, matchups between top-10 teams and unranked opponents late in November have meant nothing. Redshirt quarterback Sam Darnold and company have revived that interest. The prowess of the USC program left me glued to the TV on Saturday morning, watching and praying for a TCU upset over Oklahoma State. After a close first half, the Cowboys unfortunately ran away with the game.
The scenario I dreamed up last week was contingent on an Oklahoma State loss to the TCU Horned Frogs and about 15 other unlikely outcomes. Now, even if Colorado loses to Utah next week, Washington beats Washington State and the Trojans dominate the Huskies it probably won’t be enough to get the Trojans to the playoff.
USC needs Michigan State to beat Penn State next week, and either Michigan or Ohio State to absolutely dominate the other. They then need one of those two teams to pummel Wisconsin in the Big 10 championship game, provided Wisconsin doesn’t miraculously lose next week to a solid Minnesota football team.
Finally, since Oklahoma State won, the best the Trojans can hope for is an ugly game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Cowboys with Oklahoma State eking out a narrow victory. Of course, a Clemson loss would really help muddle the picture even more.
Even with all of this happening, I fear USC would be on the outside looking in as both Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have compelling cases for why they should be in the playoff, with the Sooners as hot as the Trojans this late in the season and the Cowboys only having one true defeat on their record.
More than anything else, it feels great to care about these games. USC has given real meaning to college football this late in the year. The above scenario is a pipe dream, but it still exists and that is more than one can say for the hopes of the last seven years of Trojan football this late in November.
Even if Colorado wins, as long as Washington beats both Washington State and Colorado, USC has a great chance of playing in the Rose Bowl. There are other scenarios that are much more favorable to the Trojans than that, but even that dismal scenario makes it pretty exciting to be a Trojan fan right about now.
Sometimes, the prowess of a program is measured in the bizarre, intangible events. After Oregon beat Utah in a wild fourth quarter, my phone was blowing up with excited messages from both diehard fans and casual USC observers. People care about Trojan football again. It’s not the manufactured interest at the beginning of the season that dies off three weeks into the year. This is real, palpable passion for a dominant Trojan program.
USC didn’t just beat UCLA yesterday. They terrorized them. They did to the Bruins what Alabama and Stanford have done to overmatched foes for the last half decade. Save for a few miscues on the Trojans part, this wasn’t even a game. The most stunning aspect of it all was that USC wasn’t even at full strength or operating on offense like they have in weeks past. The Trojans won ugly on Saturday and it was pretty beautiful. 
The Trojans are so replete with talent at the receiver position that senior De’Quan Hampton, who was a darling of spring practice last year, hasn’t been able to crack the rotation consistently. Saturday showed the nation what every fan has seen in practice -— Hampton is a physical specimen. He could follow the path of fellow Trojan physical marvels like David Ausberry and Jordan Cameron, who didn’t make a huge impact at USC but carved out solid NFL careers.
The only thing USC can control next week is their matchup against Notre Dame, who is one of the best 4-and-7 teams of all time. Hopefully the dominoes fall in some type of order that allows USC to continue their excellent play into a meaningful postseason appearance, but even if they don’t the future is as bright as ever.
The team is following through on head coach Clay Helton’s promise to play fast and physical and with Darnold at the helm anything is possible. He may make mistakes now and again, but he is as talented of a college quarterback as I have ever seen with his rocket arm and excellent speed. His ability to consistently convert on third down when all hope seems lost is the key ingredient for the Trojans’ seven-game win streak. As long as he stays healthy, Trojan fans have Heisman Trophy and national title celebrations to look forward to in the years to come. That last line feels so great to say again.

USC women’s soccer welcomed Utah to Los Angeles on Sunday for a Sweet Sixteen matchup in the NCAA Tournament. Both the No. 7 Women of Troy and the No. 23 Utes were playing their second game in three days, and the Pac-12 rivals fought fatigue and rain to compete for a berth in the Elite Eight. The two sides played to a 1-1 double-overtime draw in October in Salt Lake City, but after a close battle at McAlister Field this weekend, USC emerged victorious, extending its season with a 1-0 win.
But despite causing a few scares in the Utes’ backline, USC was unable to break the deadlock in the first 45 minutes. The second half was more of the same for USC, with Utah continuing to frustrate the Trojan offense, but sophomore forward Leah Pruitt finally pushed the Women of Troy ahead in the 73rd minute. Pruitt had a shot saved off of a low-swinging corner from freshman defender Julia Bingham, but found a way to whip at the ball while on the ground for a spectacular second-effort goal.
“I don’t really know what happened, but I fell on the ground,” Pruitt said. “I just kind of kicked my leg up, and it went in — and I was just really happy.”
No surprises there, as Pruitt’s strike ended up being the difference that sent her team through to the next round. Awaiting USC in the Elite Eight is Auburn, who knocked off SEC champion Florida on Sunday. The upset in Gainesville means the Tigers will fly out to Los Angeles. If the Gators had won, the Women of Troy would have faced a cross-country trip: a challenge head coach Keidane McAlpine was glad not to deal with.
“It makes the organizational piece a lot easier,” McAlpine said. “Preparation is still the same: We need to take care of ourselves and recover from this weekend.”
USC traveled to Auburn earlier this season, beating the Tigers 2-0. Even with the head-to-head edge, however, McAlpine wasn’t about to underestimate his opponents with the season on the line.
“They’re a different team — we’re a different team,” he said. “We’ve got to go back, watch film, and prepare … to grind another one out because they’re really hot right now.”
The Women of Troy will face off against the Tigers at McAlister Field next Friday in the Elite Eight. The final home game of the season will kick off at 1 p.m. If the Women of Troy manage to knock Auburn out, they will book their place in the Final Four, which will take place in San Jose.

I hope the band plays at this game! I haven’t seen them at any of the other NCAA matches, but their presence would be appreciated and could actually have an impact on the outcome.
Good luck to the WOT in the elite eight match vs. Auburn. The team needs to get their scoring up like in the
middle of the season. Seems like a small venue for such a big playoff game.

In a rainy MPSF Tournament final, the Men of Troy came out with a 9-6 victory in a hard-fought game against the Bruins.
Unlike the last time USC and UCLA met in a No. 1 vs  No. 2 matchup, on Sunday the Trojans took a commanding early lead. In a defensively dominated first quarter which saw junior goalie McQuin Baron save five shots, senior driver Nick Bell began the day’s scoring around two minutes in. The Trojans would go on to lead 3-0 after the first quarter. 
“It’s always good having the confidence of having a two-, three-, four-goal lead on these guys,” Baron said. “But they’re very structured and confident team so they started edging back.”
It looked like UCLA would begin drawing closer in the second, as they scored early in the quarter to cut the deficit to two goals. However, the Trojans were not going anywhere. Freshman driver Marin Dasic found the goal off of an assist from junior driver Blake Edwards and then Edwards himself extended the lead to 5-1 off a long shot. The Bruins lessened the damage when attacker Ryder Robert’s skip shot narrowly got past Baron at the end of the quarter. 
Four minutes into the second half, the Bruins and Trojans quickly traded goals, making the game 6-3 in favor of USC. Next, one of the most pivotal sequences of the game ensued. Baron saved a UCLA penalty, and then, seconds later, junior utility Bryce Hoerman netted. The Men of Troy held their biggest lead of the game, 7-3. 
Despite seizing control in the third quarter, the rest of the game was not devoid of drama. With USC up 7-4, Edwards had a chance to effectively seal the game on a penalty in the fourth quarter. However, UCLA goalie Garrett Danner was able to save the shot. Feeding off of that momentum, the Bruins’ Warren Synder scored to tighten the game at 7-5 and make yet another game between the rivals a tense affair down the stretch. 
The Trojans needed a big response, and they got one from Bell, who scored late in the fourth to extend the lead to three goals and destroy any hopes of a Bruin comeback. 
“I received the ball on two meters, and I knew that if I put that opportunity away, it would pretty much seal the game for us,” Bell said. “I was pretty pumped up when it happened.” 
With a final score of 9-5, the Men of Troy are now the 2016 MPSF Champions, which marks head coach Jovan Vavic’s tenth conference title. Baron’s performance was one of the most critical in the win, as he saved an incredible 16 shots in the team’s most important game up to this point. 
“It’s nice, but we haven’t finished it off yet,” Baron said. “We’ve still got to win the National Championship; that’s the most important one.”

In a defensively dominated first quarter which saw junior goalie McQuin Baron save five shots, senior driver Nick Bell began the day’s scoring around two minutes in. The Trojans would go on to lead 3-0 after the first quarter. 
“It’s always good having the confidence of having a two-, three-, four-goal lead on these guys,” Baron said. “But they’re very structured and confident team so they started edging back.”
It looked like UCLA would begin drawing closer in the second, as they scored early in the quarter to cut the deficit to two goals. However, the Trojans were not going anywhere. Freshman driver Marin Dasic found the goal off of an assist from junior driver Blake Edwards and then Edwards himself extended the lead to 5-1 off a long shot. The Bruins lessened the damage when attacker Ryder Robert’s skip shot narrowly got past Baron at the end of the quarter. 
Four minutes into the second half, the Bruins and Trojans quickly traded goals, making the game 6-3 in favor of USC. Next, one of the most pivotal sequences of the game ensued. Baron saved a UCLA penalty, and then, seconds later, junior utility Bryce Hoerman netted. The Men of Troy held their biggest lead of the game, 7-3. 
Despite seizing control in the third quarter, the rest of the game was not devoid of drama. With USC up 7-4, Edwards had a chance to effectively seal the game on a penalty in the fourth quarter. However, UCLA goalie Garrett Danner was able to save the shot. Feeding off of that momentum, the Bruins’ Warren Synder scored to tighten the game at 7-5 and make yet another game between the rivals a tense affair down the stretch. 
The Trojans needed a big response, and they got one from Bell, who scored late in the fourth to extend the lead to three goals and destroy any hopes of a Bruin comeback. 
“I received the ball on two meters, and I knew that if I put that opportunity away, it would pretty much seal the game for us,” Bell said. “I was pretty pumped up when it happened.” 
With a final score of 9-5, the Men of Troy are now the 2016 MPSF Champions, which marks head coach Jovan Vavic’s tenth conference title. Baron’s performance was one of the most critical in the win, as he saved an incredible 16 shots in the team’s most important game up to this point. 
“It’s nice, but we haven’t finished it off yet,” Baron said. “We’ve still got to win the National Championship; that’s the most important one.”

Director Keneth Lonergan gave a breath of fresh air to drama films with his new film Manchester by the Sea. Other films directed by Keneth Lonergan, You Can Count on Me and Margaret, were colored with the shades of death covering the lives of characters. The characters cope with fatal mistakes of their past, moving toward coveted release from all-consuming anguish.
Throughout the film, notions of grief and longing for redemption are placed at the center of the story. Native New Englander Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), who left his hometown to escape from his disastrous past, works as a handyman and doesn’t seem to enjoy communicating with people around him. His solitary existence is interrupted by the news that his older brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), has died due to a serious heart condition. 
Lee becomes a guardian for his nephew Patrick (Ben O’Brien), an arrogant teenager whose mother is an alcoholic without custody of her son. Lee accepts his new role as a straightforward and thick-skinned man, who cares only about girls and his hockey stardom. The plot goes further with its sense of sorrow as it becomes clear from a series of flashbacks that Lee has a private and dark secret. The film slowly leads the audience closer to the undisclosed event that turned Lee’s family life into its mournful ashes.
Happier times from Lee’s past were shown abruptly, bolstering curiosity about the circumstances that forced him to leave his hometown and start a new life. Flashbacks showed Lee enjoying days with his brother and son, which were then ruined by Joe’s heart failure. Joe’s wife Elisa (Gretchen Mol) plunges herself into alcoholism due to her bitter resentment. Lee’s buried relationship with his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) is portrayed through a heartbreaking montage showing their life with three young children ending up in unbearable tragedy. 
Unlike other dramas, Manchester by the Sea does not offer a saving grace for its characters. The film revealed that people sometimes cannot choose how they should move on from the past. The experienced cast perfectly conveys this message, making the audience feel the burden of an irreversible and poignant past.
Michelle Williams was effective in playing a character with a heartbreaking inability to keep up with losses. Casey Affleck was strikingly sober, but surprisingly carefree and even humorous. His character, Lee, was a man in a state of ambivalence, with conflicting feelings deep inside. 
The Massachusetts town is an appropriate setting for this shaded and modest drama, as it is shown as both blissful and bleak place. As the characters move further through the fog of their bittersweet memories, the gray sky of wintry Massachusetts and background score complement the carefully executed drama about people’s losses and their struggling to move on afterward.

When I was younger, my mother enrolled me in everything possible for me to suck at: dance classes, art classes and the worst — piano classes.
I grew up in Diamond Bar, Calif., a suburb in East Los Angeles county filled with high-achieving and competitive Asian Americans who stuffed their schedules with AP classes and extracurricular activities.
No doubt, there are many people at USC who grew up in similar areas and have their own version of my hometown, but I never noticed the extent that growing up in this specific city with this specific demographic would shape my identity.
I spoke Cantonese at home, went to school, and went to a Chinese prep school called “after school” to learn Mandarin. In high school, the Mandarin school would become SAT school.
It was “normal” to be enrolled in dozens of activities with the ultimate goal to gain entrance to the best college. Except I was never gifted or talented and I would be bitter when pushed, rather than motivated.
My mother would set a timer for me to practice, perched behind me every practice session, attentive as my teacher told her every week what I could improve on, her voice echoing along as I practiced every piece. I had just started learning back then.
“You didn’t practice today,” she was always so quick to say, as I rolled my eyes.
A few years later, I grew resentful and I quit playing. My refusal to practice meant I was no better than before. Academics getting harder, the mistakes piled up, drama from school clouding my brain. Quitting things, had become synonymous with the heaviness of failure. I wish I could have been a Carnegie Hall playing prodigy, but I wasn’t even half of that.
After many arguments about her quitting, I remember her expression — resigned, disappointed and hollow.
I didn’t know that her face would light up in pride and happiness every time I would play and learn a new song and I didn’t care either.
Our piano is still in the living room years later, collecting dust, with a red satin cloth over the keys. It’s a conversation topic whenever friends and relatives come over.
“Oh, you play?” they would ask.
“Nope, I used to,” I would answer.
After I stopped, the feeling of being a quitter has never escaped my mind. The feeling that I should be doing something to make my parents proud after all that they have done for me.
My mother quit her job to raise me, dedicated countless hours, days and weeks — so my life could be better. And she has never for a second made me feel like it wasn’t worth it.
I can’t even begin to list all of the things my mother has done for me. It’s how she picks up my phone call even when it’s the middle of the night, just so I can talk about something as trivial as somebody who ignored me at school.
She is the voice of reason for all my minuscule issues, the rides to and from school from preschool to high school, the encouragement and praise whenever I need it, and the endless amount of patience — because we all know it was pretty tough to raise somebody like me.
My mother deserves the best for the sacrifices she has made for me. Not just the world, but the whole solar system. But when I see the strands of silver in her straight hair, or the bags under eyes from a lack of sleep, I wonder if even the best would be enough.

Hosted every year in November, KASA Dance Off is a competition held between universities in Southern California that are affiliated with the Korean American Student Association. Dance Off is a freshmen-only organization in which students learn a complete dance set and compete three months later.
As the competition approaches on Nov. 21, the Daily Trojan sat down with two of USC KASA Dance Off’s coordinators, Casey Huang and Ten Francis.
Daily Trojan: What do you envision Dance Off bringing to these college freshmen?
Casey Huang: Dance Off is bottom line a competition, so we try to get everyone engaged with a competitive mindset. But something we’ve been prioritizing is providing a sense of family and support that the freshmen can count on. We know how disorienting it can be to come onto campus and feel like you can’t find a home, and we try to provide that for them.
DT: Since Dance Off is an inter-college competition, how do you think Dance Off builds community outside of just USC?
Ten Francis: I remember meeting people from other schools at competition and adding them on Facebook because they were just such great dancers I wanted to be friends with. For example, if you meet a random person through a mutual friends, it’s so sick being able to connect with each other because you both did Dance Off and share that common bond.
CH: From Dance Off, you learn so much, and it helps build yourself as a dancer and your love for dance. Dance Off makes it easier for you to relate with others who share the same passion as you. Even if you’re a beginning dancer and someone else has been dancing his entire life, you can both relate through your love for dance and how cool it is to express yourself through movement.
DT: How have you seen the team and individuals grow and change this semester?
TF: Some people are really shy. We really emphasize facials and the performance aspect of dance, so I was shocked at practice when the shiest people had a total persona switch and gave me the craziest performance with their facials. I’ve seen people who are really shy open up, and to see that moment of them wanting to be themselves is super cool.
DT: Any teasers you guys are allowed to share for the set?
CH: Be prepared to have your socks blown off because we have a great group of kids who are ready to share what they’ve been working out!
The Daily Trojan also spoke with Clarence Dureg and Aviana Spruill, two members of the 2016 Dance Off team.
DT: How has Dance Off impacted your first semester of college?
Clarence Dureg: I’ve always only watched other people dance and thought it was so cool. I wanted to do it. I knew coming into college that as an engineer, I would have to get away from all the work and math. When I’m at Dance Off, it’s a time to get away, go full out and have fun with my friends. Even though we practice late into the night, it’s a place to get away, let loose and have fun.
DT: Aside from college, how do you think Dance Off has changed you as an individual?

Aviana Spruill: I’m a very extroverted person. This is kind of hard for me, especially in a traditional classroom setting where you have to be quiet, and it’s hard for me to find a space where it’s okay to let go and express all the emotions I feel. Dance has been that place for me to let it all out.
DT: What would you say to incoming freshmen who are considering joining Dance Off?
AS: This is the most judgement-free space you can start dancing in. Dance Off is the perfect place for you to dive straight in. If you’re even considering joining, at least come out and try! It’s worth it. Don’t be the person who regrets not doing Dance Off.
CD: In college, it’s good to branch out and try new things. Going into college, it’s hard to talk to people and find a group of friends to hang out with. Coming to Dance Off, you can let yourself be you and make memories that will last a lifetime.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of KASA Dance Off. The event will be held at the Belasco Theatre on Nov. 21 at 9 p.m.

President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign promise to tighten federal immigration laws and deport millions has left many fearful, wondering what the future holds — whether they’ll be taken from their education, from their families or from their careers. Even before the rise of Trump, sanctuary cities across the United States have historically sought to quell these anxieties. In a sanctuary city, certain policies prevent federal law enforcement from detaining and prosecuting undocumented immigrants. Since the results of Nov. 9, the call to provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants has extended to colleges and universities.
Last week, an online letter with nearly 3,500 signatures from undocumented students, their family members and staff was presented to University administrators, including President C. L. Max Nikias. The letter’s demand was simple: Make USC a sanctuary campus. Becoming a “sanctuary campus” means that USC will neither allow immigration authorities on campus nor report the immigration status of students, their families or staff, if asked to provide that information.
Predictably, the debate over sanctuary campuses has devolved into a partisan issue. This partisanship fails to recognize that providing a safe haven from immigration authorities who are intent on violating the protections afforded to the undocumented is, in fact, a human rights issue. 
Both the Constitution and human rights law clearly affirm the need for sanctuary campuses, in the absence of a federal government that is willing to protect the rights of the undocumented. Campus petitions, like the one presented to USC administrators last week, have typically included three requests. First, that colleges and universities not share students’ personal information, including their immigration status, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without subpoena. Second, that they prevent immigration authorities from conducting raids on campus without a warrant. And third, that campus police officers refuse to take on the responsibility of enforcing existing immigration law. Upholding these requests indicates respect for privacy laws and Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizures.
María Blanco, executive director of the Undocumented Student Legal Services Center, has indicated her belief that, in a court of law, colleges and universities that seek to uphold these requests would be vindicated.
“If somebody got sued for what we just talked about—not sharing records which are already protected under existing law and not allowing indiscriminate raids on a campus, or because police refused to enforce immigration law—I’m positive [the plaintiff] would not win their case,” Blanco told TIME this week, suggesting courts would rule in favor of colleges and universities.
As well, human rights advocates, like the ACLU and Human Rights Watch, advocate for the rights of the undocumented, including university students. If arrested, undocumented immigrants are often not only arbitrarily arrested and detained, but also denied the right to a fair trial — violations of Article 9, 14 and 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an instrument of international human rights law to which the United States is a party. Every day, immigrants are arrested without a warrant, arbitrarily detained in crowded conditions, and deported without a fair trial.
Despite President Barack Obama’s attempts at immigration reform, the aforementioned violations persist. As a Trump presidency looms, one can reasonably assume based on the President-elect’s promises that the United States will continue to violate the human rights of the undocumented. In consideration of what can be done to address this unconscionable disregard for one of the most vulnerable communities, USC must take a stand, setting an example for the rest of the country, by providing sanctuary to all Trojans.
Bailee Ahern is a senior majoring in political science and international relations. “’Lend a Hand” ran every Monday.
Illegal immigrants need to be repatriated. USC should not sanction or legitimize law-breakers.
Sanctuary cities are illegal and will lose federal funding in 2017.  We finally have a president-elect that doesn’t have any ties to the establishment of the federal government, the lobbyists and the swamp of shameful publicly elected Congressmen and Senators that have stolen money and wealth from the American taxpayers.
The USC BOD will not allow the university to be a “sanctuary” anything, for if they did, they would lose all federal funding of grants, scholarships, research, etc.. and the USC alumni, well at most of us, would end our contributions to the university, and even to the athletic department, for which, without the history and heritage of the USC Football program, USC would be just another university.
Time to grow up, kids,
Time to get out of those silly “safe spaces” and begin to mature into adults and take responsibility for yourselves, because no one else will when you enter the work force.  Man, are you folks in for a surprise.
And while you’re at ti, stop protesting on campus. You should be in classes or studying.  Foolishness is scheduled for Thursday nights on The Row, not during the day on campus.
I really  hope one day these sanctimonious, ridiculously liberal students actually get to live in the society they espouse to want. Only then they will understand the idiocy of what they are whining for.
Harboring criminals is not going to garner alumni donations.  My wallet is closed.
I also appreciate your empathy, but please then don’t complain and write another editorial when federal funding is completely withdrawn from USC sanctuary campus and your tuition is incredibly increased to make up the difference. We are, or should be, a nation of law. We have ignored this for too long. Or just tell your daddy to write a bigger check for you—he’ll thank God you’ve only got this one year left, Ms. Ahern, before you step out into the real world.
Bailee Ahern sympathizes with Latinos seeking a better life in our country. And the particular plight of those fleeing mass murder, civil war, violent drug gangs and the like is horrible, worthy of her sympathy and mine. But a few questions:
1. Does our country or any other have the right to decide how many immigrants may enter, what kind of people they are, and from where? No? OK, then, wide open borders for all. Or yes? OK, then who gets to fix the quantities, origins and attributes of those seeking to immigrate? Congress? The President? Or you?
2. Sanctuary campus. Noble. But what should we do when the authorities come not for simple illegal immigrants, but for those with a serious police record fleeing the law? Maybe members of criminal drug gangs? Sanctuary for them, too? If no, who sorts them out? You?
3. Finally, where do you propose to house them? Dorms, fraternity and sorority houses? Doheny library? Or your personal home? And who feeds them, provides for their medical care and gives them money to live? USC students should do all of those things?
Sorry, Bailee. I applaud your sense of kindness and mercy, but this is why we have elected state, local and the Federal government. We should sympathize with them, and the hard, demanding and difficult work they do to protect us.

The election of President-elect Donald Trump has raised concerns for a number of groups consistently targeted by Trump’s rhetoric and policy proposals, many of which infringed upon the civil liberties of racial and ethnic minorities, throughout the election season. But Trump’s comments about women, from their appearances and roles in the workplace, to what acts constitute sexual assault, were particularly concerning. Despite the misogynistic undertones of Trump’s campaign, 53 percent of white woman voters cast their ballots for him. Like many of Trump’s followers, his female supporters were largely disinterested in social issues. But now that we have elected Trump, it’s important to understand what this means for an issue as critically important as reproductive choice, which arguably affects university women and their livelihoods more than any other demographic. 
Though President-elect Trump has yet to comprehensively outline his plans for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, he has stated on numerous occasions his intent to repeal many parts of the law, which established a public, affordable marketplace of insurance plans. According to 2014 estimates by the Guttmacher Institute, under the ACA, 67 percent of insured women were paying $0 for birth control pills. If women’s health care services are among the facets of Obamacare Trump and his Republican colleagues intend to scrap, in addition to likely cutting funding for Planned Parenthood, which widely offers free or affordable birth control, low-income women and female college students will be disproportionately affected. 
In recent years, House Speaker Paul Ryan has led numerous attempts to defund the women’s health organization. Vice President-elect Mike Pence defunded Planned Parenthood while serving as Indiana’s governor, leading to the closure of numerous clinics that did not even offer abortion services, contributing to a mass HIV outbreak in one county. In addition to it being entirely possible that the many young women accessing contraceptive coverage through the ACA, it’s likely that they could lose access to free contraceptive coverage from Planned Parenthood as well.
While exact statistics about the rate of hormonal and long-term birth control use among university women are not available, Guttmacher notes that in 2010, 80 percent of women with sexual experience have used or were using the pill, while 62 percent of women of reproductive age were using a birth control method. Wider access to birth control, likely through ACA options, has notably reduced unplanned pregnancy and abortion rates among young women in recent years, rendering anti-choice politicians like Trump, Pence and Ryan’s subtle crusade on birth control coverage counterproductive. And along with attacking access to contraception, Trump and Pence have both expressed interest in the repeal of Roe v. Wade. Despite the ultimate unlikelihood of this, states like Texas and Indiana with predominantly Republican legislatures are already floating highly restrictive bills.
Many young women attending universities are not employed and reliant on either the health care plans of their parents, their college’s student health care plan, coverage by the ACA or Planned Parenthood for birth control. They are justifiably concerned about their reproductive futures as they pursue higher education in the years to come. Without access to their most fundamental right to take control over their bodies, in addition to the academic stress of attending university, female students will also have to struggle with the anxiety of how to prevent unwanted pregnancy.
For decades, birth control has enabled women to pursue ambitions outside of the domestic sphere, namely making attending college possible for young women. Access to reproductive choice speaks to whether women are perceived by their elected officials as autonomous human beings with the right to pursue academic and professional careers, or objects to be imprisoned by biology and patriarchy. Under the Trump administration, our elected officials have made their perceptions of women clear. And now more than ever, universities across the nation, like the University of Southern California, must stand with the female members of their student body.
At USC, the Women’s Health Team at Engemann Student Health Center offers Long-Acting Reversible Contraception and emergency contraception to insured students, according to its website. With the ACA soon to be dramatically scaled back, USC must speak to how it will keep student insurance plans affordable and crucial services protecting reproductive choice accessible to female students, through all the potential decisions on women’s health care funding the Republican Congress and Trump administration make in the years to come. If USC and other American universities across the nation respect their female students and truly wish to protect their educational prospects, colleges will lay out plans to address female students’ justified concerns with their right to bodily autonomy in the years to come.

You seem to think you speak for all women, but 42% of women voted for Trump (and over half of white women, as you pointed out). America has been more pro-life than pro-choice since 2012. Even a year ago a poll from liberal-leaning CNN reported that 58% of Americans are pro-life and oppose abortion (not” anti-choice” as you incorrectly state. Respect the terms unless you want to be called “anti-life” or “pro-death”). This narrow-minded assumption that everyone agrees with the opinion of the louder minority is only dangerous to yourself when. Americans will let you blare away and quietly undertake changing the system. This is how Trump got elected.
And if 62% of women are on birth control, that means 38% of women choosing not to be sexually active (including myself – a college student, how shocking) are paying with our tax dollars for your birth control. How is that fair? If anything “health care” for women should look at providing sanitary care for menstrual cycles etc., as that is a huge issue in impoverished communities that affects far more than 62%.
I have two options to avoid unwanted pregnancy: 1) Regular church attendance and 2) Abstinence.  The first will help you with the second.  Wait until marriage, for goodness sake.
What are your specific fears over a single person?  Do you actually think he will use his “pen and phone” to decree  measures that destroy our liberties?  Put your childish sensitivities aside and think while placing a premium on reality.
Not sure where you are getting your information, though I suspect it is from alt-left organization and the New American Socialist Party bureau of disinformation.  There is nothing about Trump that is offensive to women and minorities. Read his platform and plan for America.  Hillary Clinton has proven to be more anti-women than Trump.  
As for the birth control issue, do not mix up women’s rights for birth control options and abortion. They are different and unfortunately should not be related in any way, shape or form.  There are over 20 options for birth control that do not provide for the ability for the mother to kill her baby, just because she wishes it so.
Be responsible for yourself and use proper methods of birth control. Abortion is not to be used as birth control. It is a medical procedure to be used, depending on the baby’s term in the womb, to save the mothers life, if and only if, her life is in jeopardy. Late term abortions and partial birth abortions are horrific, violent and evil acts, and which Hillary Clinton is in favor.  
The alt-left has brainwashed generations of American Kids since the late 1960s, and the American people have finally spoken.  We have had enough of leftist lineralism doctrine runnjng our country, cities and education systems. It has been a long time in coming, but now we have spoken and are takin back country.  The left leaning steering of I ur country his in the beginning stages of straightened our our path throught this new Era of the USA. All engines full speed ahead. Do not divert from the stated goals of Making America Great Again.  – 
And here’s wishing you and all USC students safe travels home for the Thanksgiving holiday.
… Fight On .
