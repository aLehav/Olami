Senior centerfielder Timmy Robinson rejoiced as he strutted to first base after collecting his second walk-off hit already in this baseball season, when his single to left field in the bottom of the tenth inning scored redshirt sophomore Frankie Rios.
The baseball team survived the Pepperdine Waves in dramatic fashion Tuesday night winning 6-5 in an eventful game that involved five lead changes and 24 hits from the two teams to improve the Trojans to a 13-14 record.
After being named Pac-12 Player of the Week for his team high .462 batting average last week, Robinson said that his goal for the remainder of the season is to remain consistent and focused on the field.
“I just wanted to put the ball in play,” said Robinson. “A strikeout does nothing there. I got a little anxious early in the count, but I just stuck with it and he eventually gave me a fastball which I could do something with and just stayed over it and found the hole.”
USC’s first run was scored by junior leftfielder Corey Dempster who led off with a double. Two ground balls advanced him to home with the RBI going to junior catcher Jeremy Martinez.
After allowing one hit in the first inning, USC freshman pitcher CJ Stubbs let up the first 2 runs for the Waves in the second after hitting a batter that led to one run being scored on a single to right field. After another single from Waves freshman leftfielder Matthew Kanfer allowed Pepperdine to bring 1 run in but a second was stopped from scoring after Martinez tagged him out at home plate.
USC responded in the bottom of the second inning and tied the game at 2 runs a piece after back-to-back singles from sophomore third baseman Adalberto Carrillo and Ramirez. Dempster singled to right field to score 1 run and the inning ended when a second runner was cut down at the plate.
Stubbs allowed 4 runs on seven hits through five innings against the Waves. He also posted six strikeouts. After Stubbs was pulled, the pitching combination of seniors Brent Wheatley, Marc Huberman and Brooks Kriske only gave up 1 run through the remaining five innings.
Head coach Dan Hubbs was pleased with the results from his bullpen.
“What I was really excited about was just to see Brent [Wheatley] to come in and pitch two scoreless,” Hubbs said. “You know, he has been scuffling, and I think he is starting to turn the corner, and we are going to need that because we are going to need him to become a big part of what we do.”
The Trojans took their second lead of the contest in the fourth inning after Carrillo initiated the Trojans’ offense with a leadoff double. Carrillo advanced to third base thanks to the efforts of senior first baseman AJ Ramirez’s sacrifice bunt, and scored the only run of the inning as a result of a single from freshman first baseman Dillon Paulson.
USC tied the game in the bottom of the fifth when a Martinez single to right-center field scored senior outfielder David Oppenheim who had doubled to right field as the previous batter. Martinez had three hits on five at-bats leading to two RBI’s.
Robinson scored in the sixth to give the Trojans the lead once more when Carillo hit a sacrifice fly to right center. Two scoreless innings would ensue until Pepperdine’s junior shortstop Manny Jefferson hit a solo home run to left field.
The game went to extra innings where Kriske closed without allowing a run in the tenth. The second batter of the inning for Pepperdine was sophomore second baseman Chase Lambert who singled before advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Lambert advanced to third on a ground out. With two outs, Kriske hit the batter, junior centerfielder Jeremy Goldentz. With two runners on base and a full count, Matthew Kanfer grounded out to third, and USC escaped.
The leadoff batter was Oppenheim who was walked. Rios entered the game as a pinch runner, and Martinez hit a single to left field that allowed Rios to advance to third. The walkoff hit came from Robinson when he hit a single to left field. Rios scored ending the game.

Senior discus thrower Tera Novy was announced as the Pac-12 Women’s Field Athlete of the Week after she broke the USC school record in the discus over the weekend. The honor is for the week of March 28-April 3 and was announced by the conference on Tuesday.
Novy broke the school record for the first time last season, when she threw 193-11, breaking Kate Hutchinson’s record from 2006 of 189-5. Novy’s new personal best is the new school record of 196-6 or 59.9 meters. She bested herself by two feet and seven inches.
Novy’s record-breaking throw came on April 2 at the California Collegiate in La Jolla, Calif.
With the performance, Novy has thrown 189-10 in all three meets this season. Only three women in USC’s history have ever thrown 180 feet — two of them being Novy and the previous record-holder Hutchinson.
Novy’s record-breaking throw from the meet is also the top throw by a collegian this year.
Novy is the fourth Trojan to earn Pac-12 Track and Field Athlete of the Week honors. For the week of March 21, three Trojans earned the honor. The recipients were sophomore Ricky Morgan Jr. who runs the 400m, sophomore jumper Adoree’ Jackson and, on the women’s side, senior Jaide Stepter who competes in the hurdles.

Monday night something incredible occurred. By now, surely most people reading the sports page have seen it, even many who do not read the sports page as well.
The ending of the NCAA championship game will go down in history as one of the most dramatic endings to a basketball game. ESPN will make a 30 for 30 about it one day.
I unfortunately had class during the game, but thanks to a very caring and realistic professor, the game was streamed on one screen in our classroom. As the game wore on, my classmates’ attention spans waned and focuses shifted from the lecture to the game.
Class was eventually paused all together as the group collectively held their breath for the final three or so minutes.
When North Carolina’s Marcus Paige hit what has to be one of the most iconic shots of all-time, the classroom erupted. Most of the group — either with no preference of the victor or pulling for UNC — was ready to celebrate an uncanny and unprecedented shot.
But in hindsight, what could have been the greatest moment in sports of the year, became just that — what could have been. The photo would have been everywhere: Magazine covers, front pages of newspapers, profile pictures for some die-hard Tar Heels. But no.
Marcus Paige is destined to be remembered for the guy who almost won the National Championship. Almost.
Or will he even be remembered?
The last-second heroics of Kris Jenkins to win the game are what is being talked about because there is still a difference between a shot that wins a game and one that doesn’t. It may seem harsh in a world in which participation awards are given to every kid who participates in a rec league, but it’s the real world.
There is certainly a place for boosting a young child’s confidence and sports are a fantastic way to do that. However, when a national title is on the line, you either win or lose.
Marcus Paige lost. Even though, after seeing that shot, I wish he would have won. The shot was something incredible, dramatic and left spectator’s heads reeling with incredulous thoughts. And yet, all at once, it wasn’t enough, but it set the stage.
When Jenkins hoisted his 3-point attempt to give Villanova the lead and the win, it was set-up by the Paige shot just moments prior. While Villanova going on to win would have been incredible for them, the iconic way in which Jenkins ended the game would not have been possible had Paige not drained a shot so Stephen Curry-like that it left audiences leaping out of their seats.
This shot should be remembered for both the athletic prowess and superiority that is displayed as well as the role it had in creating the unfolding drama of the end of the game.
Surely the end of the game will be written about, talked about, filmed about, but how many will acknowledge that the beauty and drama of the winning moment came from what seemed to be an agonizing defeat just seconds earlier.
“I don’t think there’s a whole lot of people that have experienced such highs and such lows in that short of a time,” Paige told ESPN after the game.
Given what he had just gone through, Paige was fairly eloquent and composed about the situation.
It’s too bad that there can’t be a consolation prize or a participation ribbon that would make UNC and Paige especially feel better about what happened. Their performance will be remembered forever, but not for the reason any of them would have wanted.
Sports still holds a special place in our dreams for that reason. Both teams competing last night went through trials and tribulations and showed their survival skills for the past five months, but the last few weeks in particular.
For all the hard work that every man on both teams put into their championship dreams though, there can only be one victor. The enticement of winning, of cutting down the nets, of being remembered as the greatest of your time was enough to push these young men to excellence and will continue to do so for generations to come.
Yet, one whole side of that will never be celebrated or treated as champions. All of the accomplishments of the season will lead up to the shot that almost was.

The quarterback competition between redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold continued on Tuesday as the football team hit the practice field for the 10th time this spring.
Darnold’s Development
Head coach Clay Helton put the quarterbacks in some situational football to wrap up practice, simulating a third overtime where both quarterbacks had to go for the 2-point conversion. Both Browne and Darnold managed to throw touchdowns, but Darnold won it with a 2-point conversion to senior wide receiver De’Quan Hampton.
Helton once again praised Darnold’s improvement over the spring.
“The first six practices you were like, ‘Oh gosh, where is he going with the ball?” Helton said. “Now the light’s clicking on and he’s starting to understand the system. Because of that, you’re seeing the ball coming out more on time.”
On the 2-point conversion, Darnold found Hampton despite a tough throw in motion.
“He stepped right up in the pocket, didn’t rest his feet — he’s on the move and throws a stutter-go for the touchdown,” Helton said. “Not the easiest pass in the world and he has enough arm strength to do that.”
The head coach said that Darnold has been taking more reps with the first team. Quarterbacks and pass game coordinator Tyson Helton talked about where the redshirt freshman was with learning the playbook.
“He’s getting close,” Tyson Helton said, noting that Darnold needs more reps. “When he’s in there, he performs well. Even when he’s not quite sure, he has big vision; he can see the whole field and he finds people.”
A Friendly Competition
Despite the fact that only one of the quarterbacks will claim the starting job in September, Browne and Darnold are friends off the field.
The pair hang out when they’re not between the lines, but the conversation almost never strays to football.
“We joke around about [the quarterback competition] a lot,” Darnold said. “We don’t like to talk about it a lot, obviously. We just talk about our friendship and what we are doing later, all the normal stuff.”
Browne called the competition a “friendly battle.” Still, the elephant remains in the room.
“The best guy’s going to play,” Browne said. “I think we both understand that.”
No Decision Yet
While Browne was largely viewed as the favorite to land the starting spot heading into spring practice, Darnold’s performance has certainly re-shaped the conversation.
Tyson Helton spoke earnestly about what sets the two quarterbacks apart.
“You’ve got the younger guy [Darnold] who just throws to the open guy for touchdowns and you’ve got the older guy [Browne] who knows why he’s doing what he’s doing,” Tyson Helton said. “They push each other and it makes us better as a team.”
Tyson Helton was asked what he should tell fans who think Darnold has a slim chance as a redshirt freshman.
“I would say don’t put anything past anybody,” Tyson Helton said. “The best player plays. If you’ve got a quarterback that can make plays … No matter what year he is, you play him.”
Still, Tyson Helton is glad it will be his brother — and not him — picking the starter.
“I’ve got the easy job,” he said. “I don’t pick the quarterback; I just coach them.”
Dialing It Up
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast ramped up the blitzes during practice. On several occasions, the quarterbacks were forced to run from the pocket and throw the ball away.
Clay Helton said Pendergast ran through 20 all-pressure situations. It reminded him of Pendergast’s strategy in his last go-round as defensive coordinator at USC during the 2013 season.
“That’s what I remember Clancy’s defense, being ultra-aggressive … [it was] just a hard day for the quarterbacks,” Clay Helton said. “I was sitting back there going, ‘I have no idea where [the pressure’s] coming from.”

Researchers at USC and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab are working toward observing the growth of fungi in space that could help create useful drugs in the future.
Clay Wang, a professor of pharmacology, pharmaceutical sciences and chemistry at the USC School of Pharmacy and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said the team wants to examine how the organisms behave in the new environment.
“In this project we’re utilizing the space station to understand how microorganisms, specifically fungi react to space conditions. And we are interested to see whether we can find new drugs from them,” Wang said.
According to studies, the vast majority of molecules that fungi can produce remain undiscovered. The study is specifically based on the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The space station will be used to understand the growth, gene expression and physiological responses of these organisms and compare them to earth. In most cases, the mechanisms to make these drugs are not turned on, and these organisms make drugs only when they have to. The space condition is used to test how the organisms behave under the stressful environment of the International Space Station.
Fungi have the potential to produce many substances that could be useful for drugs, such as penicillin, but in most cases they are not produced. There is potential to find new molecules produced by these organisms when they grow on the space station.
“We are going study how these microorganisms behave and also its gene expression,” Wang said. “If we can figure out whether they are being made more on the space station and what are the switches to make more, we can repeat that on Earth. Once we know what the genes are, we can genetically modify them on earth so we will be able to make drugs in large amounts and bring down their costs.”
This project originated in NASA’s space biology division and NASA provided the grant to USC. This research mission, called Micro-10, examines the effects of space conditions on fungal cells and seeks to understand the changes in the types of molecules that these cells produce as a response to different conditions.
Kasthuri Venkateswaran, a scientist at NASA’s JPL, was the main collaborator with Wang in this research. Two members of Wang’s research team, Jillian Rohmsdahl and Adriana Blachowicz are graduate students at USC.
Wang stressed how crucial the work of Rohmsdahl and Blachowicz has been to this experiment.
“I think it’s important to highlight the graduate students who are the main drivers on this project and the opportunities here at USC to be able to do things,” Wang said. “It is a very exciting point that School of Pharmacy is now doing space research. It was a very good collaboration with NASA and Dr. Venkat because he gave his expertise, but we at USC gave the pharmaceutical science expertise.”
The samples of the organisms have been provided to NASA by Wang and his team. The first attempt of the space launch of the samples Friday.

The University has officially crossed the $5 billion threshold of the $6 billion fundraiser that was publicly launched in 2011. According to an annual fundraising report released by the Council for Aid to Education, USC raised more than $653 million for the school last year.
The campaign encompasses a comprehensive strategic planning process and the involvement of all USC constituencies according to Albert Checcio, senior vice president of university advancement.
“We designed a campaign that would touch all parts of the University,” Checcio said. “Every single school would participate in this campaign. So it is very comprehensive.”
Half of the funds, or approximately $3 billion of the money raised, will be used to increase USC’s endowment. These funds will help support faculty and students, along with research, public health services and enhancement of the quality of life around the world.
Two billion dollars of the money that is being dedicated to the endowment will be dedicated to faculty and research programs, The other $1 billion will be devoted to an endowment for student scholarships. The priority of this endowment is additional undergraduate scholarship aid and increasing fellowships for Ph.D., postdoctoral and graduate students.
The rest of the money from the fundraising campaign will provide immediate support for new resources.
Two billion dollars of these funds are for the immediate support of academic priorities. The campaign will help establish new educational programs and nurture the research projects that aim to explore the intersections of technology and communication, extend global connections, foster arts and humanities and enrich the undergraduate and graduate learning experiences.
One billion dollars will be catered toward immediate support for capital projects. One of these capital projects is the USC Village, scheduled to open in Fall 2017. These funds are needed for infrastructure on both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
“In the campaign, we don’t have priorities; our job is to try to fund them,” Checcio said. “So, the president and deans did a strategic plan and identified a whole series of priorities. These priorities became the programs that we tried to raise money for, through the campaign.”
Fifty-two percent of the raised funds will be for academic priorities, 34 percent for the endowment and 14 percent for capital projects. As of March 4, 296,775 donors have made campaign gifts. A total of $1.4 billion has been raised for faculty and research endowments, $230 million for endowment toward student scholarships and $1.6 billion for health sciences.
“All of the schools have individual goals to try to meet their needs,” Checcio said. “So, when we were setting the goal, we looked at will it take private support to continue USC’s academic ascent and take the University to excellence for the next 10 years and beyond. After looking at the analysis of what the schools need, $6 billion was the number we thought was attainable and would have the biggest impact.”
The alumni have contributed $1.8 billion, and parents have contributed $1.4 billion to the campaign. Also, 262,436 donors have made gifts of less than $1,000. Checcio further mentioned the how important the donations have been to the success of the fundraising initiative.
“The whole University is benefiting dramatically from the private support of this campaign,” Checcio said.
Daniel Hennes, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that the increase in funding will help make the University a better place.
“The recent fundraising campaign speaks not only to the administration’s commitment to make the University a better place for its students, but also to the passion and willingness of the Trojan Family to give back,” Hennes said. “USC is a place that wants to remain cutting-edge and this fundraising campaign is a great way to do that.”
Juan Martinez, a junior majoring in civil engineering, did not immediately laud the administration’s efforts, pointing to the fact that many students do not know where the money is going.
“Many of us probably won’t — we already feel tuition hikes, but hopefully it’ll benefit the university in some way,” Martinez said. “It’s just hard to tell when we don’t really know where the money goes.”

Islamophobia both at USC and internationally was discussed as part of a panel entitled “No Place for Hate: The Alarming Rise of Anti-Muslim Incidents on University Campuses,” which was held at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Tuesday afternoon.
The panel was part of the Journalism Director’s Forum and was held in conjunction with the Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg and the Office of Religious Life.
“The fear — as I remember it — reached a fever pitch at times and sometimes built a mob justice mentality,” said moderator Sandy Tolan, author on the Middle East and professor of journalism at Annenberg, who, in his introduction, compared the fear of Muslims post-9/11 to the fear following terrorist attacks 15 years later in San Bernardino and Paris. “The people most affected by this particular sense of American patriotism were not victims of mistaken identity, but American Muslims themselves living as the country’s most vulnerable citizens.”
Panelists Varun Soni, the dean of religious life at USC; Edina Lekovic from the Muslim Public Affairs Council; Muslema Purmul, Muslim chaplain at USC, UCLA and UC Irvine; and Noorhan Maamoon, International Affairs chair of the USC Muslim Student Union and a columnist for the Daily Trojan, shared their perspectives on Islamophobia.
Maamoon has had firsthand experience with Islamophobia, and was adamant that talking about these issues would make a difference. Maamoon spoke about a time when she was walking to a football game with a hijab and someone yelled at her and her friend, “Terrorist!”
“At first it didn’t register what he said but then I realized that because he saw two girls wearing a hijab he thinks that we are, in fact, terrorists,” Maamoon said.
Purmul said that, as a Muslim chaplain, she talks to many women who are afraid of dressing as a Muslim because of the stereotypes that are associated with the typical headdress and clothing style.
“What comes up a lot for Muslim women is the fear of being targeted for dressing as a Muslim,” Purmul said. “The question that sometimes comes up is ‘Please tell me something that can make me stronger’ because I feel weak right now and I want to take [the hijab] off.”
Purmul responded to Tolan’s follow-up question on what she tells these women to help them with their faith by stressing the importance of compassion and awareness of one’s surroundings.
“I do encourage them to be cautious, and depending on who the student is and the specific situation, be more aware of their surroundings,” Purmul said. “But at the same time [I encourage them] to smile more, to love more, to reach out more, to connect more, to overcome the fear of being harmed and go out of your way to spread compassion.”
Along the same vein of compassion, Soni said that it is important to facilitate strong relationships between people of contrasting backgrounds in order to reduce incidents of Islamophobia.
“I see our Muslim and Jewish students going out to Skid Row and serving the community together and then going to the mosque or going to the synagogue to talk about how this experience made them feel,” Soni said. “We can create and promote and facilitate those types of relationships.”
Lekovic expressed the same sentiment as Maamoon, Purmul and Soni, but added that in order to overcome the fear of Muslims, more people need to get to know them. She said that two out of three Americans do not know a Muslim and that Muslims make up 1 percent of the American population.
“If 32 percent of [Americans] know some degree of that 1 percent of Americans who are Muslims, it’s not as depressing as it first looks,” Lekovic said. “That matters because we know that exposure is a way to begin to deal with and heal phobias.”
Soni, who is the first Hindu dean of Religious Life at USC, said that the best way to combat Islamophobia is to give the public a better education on different religions because at this point, he joked, atheists are the best educated on religion.
“We suffer in the United States from a lack of religious literacy,” Soni said. “People come to college with a fairly low degree of religious literacy, unless you are an atheist, humanist or agnostic, then you know more religion than anyone else.”
Hollie Bowers, a junior majoring in public relations, spoke  about the importance of coexisting with one another.
“I came to this event because I recently felt really passionate about religion and religious life on campus especially and coexisting together,” Bowers said. “We all have our different beliefs, and I think it’s important that we respect each other and hear each other out and support each other though the process of faith and growing and our own spirituality.”
“We suffer in the United States from a lack of religious literacy,” Soni said. “People come to college with a fairly low degree of religious literacy, unless you are an atheist, humanist or agnostic, then you know more religion than anyone else.”

I really wish people like you would quit lecturing people like me about what I do or do not know.
I know Mohammed enslaved women.
I know Mohammed led 60 battles against infidels.
I know Mohammed got rich by stealing from the weak.
I know Islam spread from Medina to its current massive landholdings through violent jihad.
I know Islam committed genocide in Sudan just twenty years ago and that it is currently committing genocide in Nigeria.
I know Muslim jihadists have blown up civilians in Bali, Mumbai, Brussels, NYC, Paris, Malmo, Kenya, and on and on and on.
Please quit lecturing me on what I do or do not know about Islam.  Plus I am not interested in your sanitized version of Islam that focuses on what you want us to know while leaving out everything that makes Islam supremacist, sadistic and expansionist
People are =/= to their religion
I am most definitely an infidel in that I have no belief in any god or gods. A person’s individual godview is the most basic right possible that a human being can have. I personally reject Islam, Judaism, and Christianity (among others)…but do not reject Muslims, Jews, and Christians. A person’s religion and religious culture are most predictably based on their family of origin, where they were born (geography), and when they were born (i.e. no Xians pre-Christ).
I stand with all people on the planet willing to work together as a species to live peacefully with each other and our environment. That does not change regardless of the actions of some who think their ‘godview’ justifies any number of horrible acts.
I reject those who use such acts to demonize people who are damned for nothing more than ‘guilt by association.’
~ LanceThruster
Lance, for sake of discussion…. where do you think your ancestors, your biology came from?
I am of Russian/Lithuanian heritage from a few generations back. Was raised Catholic. Details sketchy on the great-grandparents and before, so there is a possibility that we might have been in the group (Jews) that converted to Christianity to avoid persecution.
I’m from a Portugues/English Catholic mother whose family settled in Hawaii in the late 1800s and an eastern european jewish heritage father whose family immigrated to America via Ellis Island and settled in NYC and Norfolk, VA.
But what I meant with my question, was if you are an atheist, where do you think humans came from?
The website atheism[dot]about[dot]com has a piece on abiogenesis and evolution. To posit a supernatural explanation (of both humans, and the entity supposedly responsible for the creation of all of the cosmos) is, to me, unsatisfying. I prefer to say ‘I don’t know’ than to ascribe reality to a ‘magic’ being outside of the natural world.
Don’t make the hypothesis so complex.  Of course we come from the image of god, but the issue is what was god?  Was god an supreme being that rules Heaven, or was god the creator, one of the super races of extraterrestrial beings that colonized the planet many eons ago….It’s somewhat akin to what Fundamentalist Christians believe, in that they think the world was created 6000 years ago.  Well, oddly enough that may be true, but just not in the way they think it happened.
Until scientists can explain the missing 3-4 genes that are in our DNA, that has no relationship to the other genes, one could assume that we, humans, are the byproduct of extraterrestrial mating of female bipedal creatures who roamed the earth by any of the ‘so called” 13 ET races that terraformed and colonized earth.
Carl Sagan was a believer that human DNA is very much aligned with any living organism, such as trees and plants, for example…. That we share DNA.  Read his book, The Garden of Eden.  Quite fascinating.
Others believe the ET theory, as I am more and more thinking along those lines.  It makes sense to me, but what do I know.  There are 3 truths in life.
1. You know what you know.
2. You know what you don’t know.
3. You don’t know what you don’t know.
and there ya have it for now.
“She said that two out of three Americans do not know a Muslim and that Muslims make up 1 percent of the American population.”

But 100% of Americans read on a nearly daily basis about the crimes against humanity Muslims commit in the name of Allah.  And let’s quit pretending the never ending attacks are aberrational.  I’ve never met a Nazi but that does not mean I would think differently about him or her after the displeasure of their company.  (Please know I am not saying Muslims are Nazis.)
“Along the same vein of compassion, Soni said that it is important to facilitate strong relationships between people of contrasting backgrounds in order to reduce incidents of Islamophobia.”

Are Muslims allowed to be friends with Christians, Jews or other non-Muslims? 
Unbelievers are described by Muhammad (in the Quran) as “the vilest of animals” and “losers.” Christians and Jews are hated by Allah to the extent that they are destined for eternal doom as a result of their beliefs. It would make no sense for Muhammad to then recommend that they be taken as friends by Muslims. In fact, the Quran plainly orders believers not to take unbelievers as friends.

Quran
Quran (5:51) – “O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.”
Quran (5:80) – “You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve; certainly evil is that which their souls have sent before for them, that Allah became displeased with them and in chastisement shall they abide.” Those Muslims who befriend unbelievers will abide in hell.
Quran (3:28) – “Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except by way of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them…” This last part means that the Muslim is allowed to feign friendship if it is of benefit. Renowned scholar Ibn Kathir states that “believers are allowed to show friendship outwardly, but never inwardly.”
Quran (3:118) – “O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people, they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will understand.” This verse not only warns Muslims not to take non-Muslims as friends, but suggests that that the rest of the world is out to get them and can’t be trusted.
Quran (9:23) – “O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers” Even family members are not to be taken as friends if they do not accept Islam. (There are harsher interpretations of this verse. The same (ninth) sura advocates “slaying the unbeliever wherever ye find them”).
Quran (53:29) – “Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but the life of this world.”
Quran (3:85) – “And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.”
Quran (3:10) – “(As for) those who disbelieve, surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against Allah, and these it is who are the fuel of the fire.” Those who do not believe in Muhammad are but fuel for the fire of Hell (also 66:6, 2:24. 21:98).
Quran (7:44) – “The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: “We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord’s promises true?” They shall say, “Yes”; but a crier shall proclaim between them: “The curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers” Muslims in heaven will amuse themselves by looking down on non-Muslims in Hell and mocking them while they are being tortured (see >22:19-22.
Quran (1:5-7) – “Show us the straight path, The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray” This is a prayer that Muslims are supposed to repeat each day. “Those who earn Thine anger” refers to Jews; “those who go astray” refers to Christians (see Bukhari (12:749)).
“Purmul said that, as a Muslim chaplain, she talks to many women who are afraid of dressing as a Muslim because of the stereotypes that are associated with the typical headdress and clothing style.”

Well that’s one fear Saudi Arabian women do not share.  They have no choice but to wear a full black burka or get stoned to death, no?  Or am I exaggerating the punishment?  Is it only Shi’ite, and not Sunni women who are tortured if caught not wearing a black burka in the desert kingdom?
While Muslim death squads run rampant in Lahore, Damascus, Mosul, Alexandria, Brussels and Chechnya and Muslim gang-rapists attack women in Malmo, Cologne, and Muslim jihadists burn children alive in Nigeria, kill polio vaccine workers in Sudan, blow up UN aid compounds in Kenya…
While all this is happening our distinguished guests lecture us on why it’s silly to fear Islam.
The Muslim community must disavow any actions by Islamic Terrorism and it’s jihad, else they are part mm of it.  So far, there is no outcry of  distancing themselves from mm it. 
If you know ab I UT Dearborn Heighta, MI and what the sharia law run Islamic com mm u it does there against Christians and Jews and outsiders aka infidels, you will understand why Sharia cannot and will not be acceptable in American life.  If folks want to live under Sharia, then they néedon’t to move to a country that enforces Sharia. Don’t try to change the host country’s culture or political system for your gain we will rise up and push back against any entity that tries to legislate or force their lifestyle on us.
Assimilate into American culture and we will all get along.
The screams of ‘terrorist’ pale in comparison to the screams of ‘allahu ackbar’ accompanying acts of islamic terrorism.
The journalist quipped, right before the sword severed his head and the screams of “allahu Akbar” rang out, “What me? Why should I worry about Islam”

This semester, the oldest undergraduate student at USC is redefining what it means to be a “super-senior.” 96-year-old World War II veteran Alfonso Gonzales is currently finishing up his last undergraduate unit in an elective course at the Davis School of Gerontology. If he passes, he will walk this spring with a bachelor’s degree in zoology as the oldest graduate in University history.
Before attending college, Gonzales enlisted in the Navy in 1942 and served as a Marine in Okinawa during World War II. After the war, Gonzales began his education at Compton Community College prior to transferring to USC in 1947 where he would come within inches of finishing his education.
Flash forward 69 years. What started with a family member’s attempt to secure his degree from the school quickly became an amazing opportunity, as the family member discovered that Gonzales was one unit shy of completing his undergraduate education.
“I thought all I had to do was go over there and pick up my diploma, but no, I was one unit short, they told me,” Gonzales told ABC7.
The discovery sparked a wave of excitement for the Gonzales family. Gonzales’ great niece Dorinda Geddes, 53, and nephew Mario Gonzales, 65, both of Hermosa Beach, described how receptive the administration was to helping Gonzales graduate and how quickly the whole process began.
“My cousin just wanted to get a copy of his degree, and they emailed her back that [Alfonso] was one unit short. So she did the footwork, and the process got rolling, and the professor contacted Mario, and Mario started bringing him down here,” Geddes said. “The day he was going to his first day of school I took a picture, and it went viral.”
Over the past few weeks, Gonzales has been working closely with Aaron Hagedorn, assistant professor of gerontology at Davis, in a directed study environment. The department chose Hagedorn for his affinity for and expertise in working with older adults.
“I have a passion for working with older adults,” Hagedorn said. “When we heard about this opportunity, they thought I would be able to relate well.”
Given Gonzales’ unique situation, Hagedorn tailored a one-unit elective from the framework of a popular four-unit course that would challenge Gonzales not only academically but also personally and emotionally.
“[The course is a] guided autobiography in which he will be writing his personal story and exploring self identity,” Hagedorn said. “I thought it would be perfect for somebody of his age and experience.”
Even though he’s writing his life story by hand, Gonzales is fully embracing the modern undergraduate experience. In addition to the course readings, he’s been exploring other educational mediums such as TED talks. He’s even been sitting in on freshman and senior seminars weekly. This new knowledge has seemed to inform his worldview in a profound way, such as a recent assignment Hagedorn gave to him about the idea of myth and the story of his life
“What I learned from that lesson is about attachment,” Gonzales said. “You begin to get attached since you’re born. The child gets attached to the mother, and when he gets older, he will get attached to his playmates.”
Gonzales has been able to apply these ideas to his adult life as well.
“I said, ‘Well, if we do this, then we do this in our senior and our adult stage,’” Gonzales said. “We get attached to unions, we get attached to clubs, to churches, and it’s all getting attached to one another in society. My attachment now is my family. When you get older, your attachment is to your family.”
Going back to school has come with its fair share of challenges for Gonzales. But remarkably, none of these seem to be as burdensome or relentless as Los Angeles traffic.
“Transportation is difficult, and I struggle a little bit in reading my assignment,” Gonzales said. “I have to pause when I read to comprehend it.”
On top of the weekly classes, Gonzales has stayed busy with all the new people he’s met during his return to school. Last Wednesday, he was honored at a USC sponsored ROTC event for veterans, at which he had the opportunity to cut a cake with former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus and meet President C. L. Max Nikias.
“I felt like I was back at USC again,” Gonzales said.
The family has immense pride in Gonzales, who they call “Ponchie.” They see his journey as an inspiration and his strong will as a reminder that time is not a formidable barrier to accomplishment and that it’s never too late to finish what you started.
“I was always intrigued by him,” Geddes said. “I always knew he was someone special because he always seemed so intelligent to me. My grandma would always tell me, ‘Let’s go ask Alfonso, maybe he’ll know.’ He was always this genius to me, and this proves it.”
Gonzales only has a few more weeks of class before he finishes an unprecedented accomplishment for somebody of his age.
“We have had students in their 70’s and 80’s graduate,” said Maria Henke, associate dean of the Davis School of Gerontology. “Some of them have done it online with their masters degrees, but he’s by far the oldest undergraduate we’ve ever had.”
If Gonzales passes his course, he will walk as a graduate of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences during the 2016 Commencement ceremony.
What an inspiring story! Thank you for writing this. 
Congrats to Mr. Gonzalez. What an achievement!

Seldom does real magic appear off the page or screen; typically, it is the imagination that transports minds into far-off places. However, patrons will soon have an opportunity to encounter a magical experience in real life. This Thursday, the highly anticipated Wizarding World of Harry Potter will open  at Universal Studios Hollywood.
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is an endeavor that is more than five years in the making. The Daily Trojan had an opportunity to take a tour of the park led by Alan Gilmore, supervising art director for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter and art director for the Harry Potter films.
Upon entry to the park, patrons have the opportunity to take a picture on the Hogwarts Express, complete with scarves, wands and the option of three scenic backgrounds to choose from. Those deeply familiar with the films will notice that almost every aspect of the park is identical to the Harry Potter movies — that’s because the park was designed by the same set designers.
“Everything in the park is made to look aged and distressed,” Gilmore said regarding the park’s aesthetics. “We paid very close attention to detail.”
Fans of Harry Potter will also notice familiar shops present within Hogsmeade Village and Diagon Alley. Patrons have access to the same shops made popular in the series, such as Zonko’s Joke Shop, Honeydukes Sweets Shop and Ollivander’s Wand Shop.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is the interactive elements present throughout the park. Guests who purchase a wand from Ollivander’s have the option of purchasing an interactive wand, which will allow them to practice actual spells at various magical checkpoints.
“A special medallion, encrypted with the spell incantation, will be featured beneath each magical window for guests to practice their spells, and if done correctly, will come to life before their very eyes,” the official press release states.
Additionally, the Owl Post, located right next to the Owlery (where mechanical owls sit perched above beams), serves as a real post office where guests can write postcards and letters to anywhere in the world, and can have
them postmarked in  Hogsmeade.
The park’s signature ride, “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey,” is located inside the Hogwarts tower. Designed as a “3D-HD adventure,” according to the press release, the attraction is a 360-degree adventure which takes patrons on a simulated magical journey throughout Hogwarts and other locations popular in the Harry Potter universe.
As far as eateries, the Three Broomsticks is the park’s main restaurant, serving a variety of traditional English meals including bangers and mash (grilled sausages with mashed potatoes and peas), Shepherd’s Pie (ground beef and vegetables topped with mashed potatoes), beef and lamb Guinness stew and fish and chips.  Adjoining the Three Broomsticks is the Hog’s Head Bar, which features draught beers created specifically for the park. In addition, Butterbeer carts are stationed throughout the park for a refreshing, non-alcoholic treat.
The park officially opens on April 7. Discounted student tickets may be obtained through the USC Ticket Office in the Gwynn Wilson Student Union Building. Guests are also encouraged to use the hashtag #WizardingWorldHollywood during their visit.

America’s first dog cafe has opened in Los Angeles on Virgil Avenue. The Dog Cafe, founded and owned by Sarah Wolfgang, is changing the way people can interact with and adopt animals in need. The cafe and dog lounge, which are next door to one another, are located in a small shopping center in Silverlake’s Rampart Village neighborhood. The dog lounge is currently open, but for those looking for the perfect coffee/dog combination, wait to visit until Thursday, when The Dog Cafe has its soft opening.
Wolfgang talked about the inspiration behind the creation of her cafe, which is rooted in her childhood.
“I grew up [in Korea], and I actually frequented a lot of dog cafes there,” Wolfgang said. “But my parents wouldn’t allow me to have any pets, so I would just bring my parents along so I could get my dog fix.”
Unfortunately, Wolfgang discovered that most of the dogs in Korean dog cafes are brought in from puppy mills and spend most of their lives in the cafe, so she got herself into the animal world and was able to see the rescue aspect of the business.
“[It was gratifying] to see the dogs go from being in the sheltered environment to being in a happy home,” Wolfgang said.
She moved to Los Angeles with the goal of improving the idea of the dog cafe by incorporating adoption opportunities. Wolfgang has been working on this project for two and a half years and is happy with the team she’s formed, the dog shelters she’s worked with, and the positive feedback she’s received from visitors.
“A lot of people have been very positive about the whole thing,” Wolfgang said. “[I’ve noticed that] a lot of people end up leaving a lot happier because it’s fun to watch the dogs chase each other, it’s fun to interact with the dogs, it’s interesting to learn about the dogs’ history.”
For those not necessarily looking to adopt, it is a nice way to relieve stress with some rescue-dog playtime. The fee to play with the dogs is $10 per person per hour, and guests are permitted to bring cafe items into the dog lounge.
The cafe will offer americanos, pourovers, macchiatos and an assortment of teas. Because chocolate is dangerous for dogs, no drinks with chocolate will be served. Instead, the cafe will have carob lattes on the menu, in the event that a dog accidentally consumes a beverage. The Dog Cafe will also be serving a variety of lemonades, including flavors like lavender, ginger, and rosebud.
Right now, the venue is walk-ins only, but once the cafe opens, reservations are encouraged to ensure spots. Children under five are not permitted to enter the dog lounge, and children between five and 17 must be accompanied by an adult. Adults must sign a liability waiver before entering the dog lounge.
In addition to serving coffee and providing a space for people to play with dogs, The Dog Cafe will also have a retail space, where they will sell merchandise for dogs and dog lovers.

My mom got me these three books when I was 11 or 12 called Bad Girls’ Guide to … whatever. Beneath the sparkly waterproof covers (it’s a life guide; it needs to be durable) lay all kinds of self-affirming advice and general give-no-f-cks-ery. Pearls of sarcastic and off-colored wisdom (No ziplock bags? Store your snack food in unlubricated condoms! No sticky notes? Use a pad!) that were oddly informative for my future self. OK, maybe not the snack storage example, but still.
There’s one lesson in particular that I come back to time and time again. It’s utterly profound in its hilarity, a bonafide philosophy in its silliness, and now I would like to share it with you. The Bad Girls’ Guides advise you, the intended and assumedly bad girl reader, to date yourself.
Of course, this advice can apply just as aptly to men and gender-queer individuals as well — there is no gender specificity in taking time to really appreciate yourself rather than focusing all that energy on someone else. In fact, I think it’s important for everyone, whether you’re interested in romantic pairings or not, to really lavish yourself in love from time to time. It’s not indulgent or selfish. It’s just a necessary balance to the dauntingness of everything else.
Plus, on a personal note, I’m an overall worse person when I date people. My mom says I lose my sense of self; my roommates say I obsess. I’m less happy, less creative, edgier, less tolerant — all my favorite characteristics about myself have historically gone out the window. This used to make me think swinging or open relationships would be better, since in theory I wouldn’t be quite so hyperfocused on one person. But when I tried it, I felt like I was going to burst into tears and/or vomit at any given time. In other words, it was just a much more dysfunctional version of the same thing.
I’ve been dating myself now for a little more than two months, in response to a general sense of boredom with the process of romance. Flirting, eyelash batting, banter, texting, obsessing, dating, kissing, sex. The only thing I found erotic for about a month was the feeling of snuggling up in my bed by myself. This was a new feeling for me — I’ve always spent a lot of time yearning. I had obsessive crushes and fantasized incessantly. But for whatever reason, I currently find the idea of someone else’s skin repulsive, flirting tedious, and romance uninteresting. And in my relatively asexual period, I feel more benevolent than ever.
I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed people as much as I have since I became Facebook official with myself. I’m an unrelenting introvert — not as in I’m shy but in the physiological definition of the term. Social interactions ramp up my autonomic responses or, in other words, make me jittery and sweaty. I’ve overridden my instinct to avoid people out of necessity but my perpetual pit stains know who I really am.
I think now perhaps I take the near-death quantity of adrenaline brought on by talking to people as more thrilling than scary. I, an unabashed homebody, went out four nights in a row last week and loved every minute of it. I made two new friends in one of my anonymous lecture classes mid-semester, well after I normally would have deemed any kind of social interaction in that context utterly impossible. I don’t know who this new person is, who I’ve become, but I really like her and want to take her out more, get to know her better.
I’m obsessively in love, just not with a person exactly. With the future, with right now, with myself. Everyone’s attractive. Everyone’s friendly and supportive. Everyone’s interesting. I feel like I’m dating my entire capstone class, and I’m getting all my kicks from writing, socializing and creating. This is the first time in my collegiate experience, hell, since my junior year of high school, that I’m so creatively satisfied that romance seems superfluous. This may be the best relationship I’ve ever had. This might be the one.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the landmark minimum wage deal that bypassed ballot measures on Monday morning, undertaking a statewide experiment of sorts. California will be the first state to raise the wage to $15 an hour in increments from 2017 to 2022, following in the footsteps of cities such as Seattle and New York City. Though this decision marks a victory for workers’ groups, like Fight for 15, it doesn’t signal the end of the struggle for a livable wage. Rather, it prompts close monitoring and tandem legislation to ensure that the cost of living does not eclipse the spending power of California’s wage earners.
Despite rising inflation rates, the Fair Labor Standards Act set the federal hourly minimum wage at $7.25 in 2009, with no changes since. In 19 states, the minimum wage is either the federal level or does not exist at all. Given that if California could stand alone, it would be the world’s eighth largest economy, it is a mystery as to why it took this long to secure the remuneration and stability of its workforce.
In fact, wage fairness in California — particularly in Los Angeles — has been moving in the opposite direction in the recent past. The nonprofit research group Economic Roundtable reports that wage erosion has caused 75 percent of L.A. laborers to earn less than comparable workers from 30 years ago. In the face of wage injustice, economists have carefully arrived at the $15 wage as a livable one, and concluded that the increase can take place without job loss because increases will be incremental. After years of post-recession stagnation and the tireless efforts of politically mobilized workers, the plan signed by Brown comes as a long-awaited breath of fresh air — and just plain common sense.
California would do well to look at other cases of the $15 minimum wage, however. Seattle, which has a high cost of living similar to that of Los Angeles and San Francisco, passed its wage reform law in 2014 and will hit its $15 goal as soon as 2017. Their plan even sets the wage over $18 by the year 2025. In addition, the new California minimum wage will mean different things in different regions; Pew Research Center reports that densely populated areas, like Southern California and the coast, will only exercise a spending power of $12 relative to the hourly $15 wage. This cost adjustment and Seattle’s prospective wage increases put the new California law into perspective — if what workers need now is $15, will that amount still be appropriate by the year 2022?
Perhaps not, but there are certain things California legislators can do to facilitate living on $15 an hour. In a state where 20-somethings shell out $400 a month to live in a wooden “pod” barely larger than a mattress, housing costs need serious regulation. Even with the blessing of improved transportation in Los Angeles comes a curse — renting prices along the unopened Expo Line of the Metropolitan Transit Authority have already shot up by as much as 45 percent. If gentrification wrought by the projected Metro extensions prices out locals of working-class neighborhoods like the San Fernando Valley’s Van Nuys and Sylmar, soon there won’t be affordable housing for minimum wage earners and their families, and bustling areas like Los Angeles will face a deficit of workers that once ran their economies.
Another large expense factored into the cost of living is nutrition, which varies regionally depending on the presence of food deserts where fresh fare is lacking and people opt for unhealthy, readily available fast food. Food deserts have nearly become a way of life in L.A. and USC’s own neighborhood of South Central, but they also paradoxically plague central regions of California, where produce is grown in mass quantities. The state racks up $10.4 billion in annual obesity-related healthcare spending as a function of its unhealthy eating habits, an insurmountable sum for people working for $15 an hour.
Though Brown’s minimum wage deal is a welcome and necessary change in California’s economic landscape, the reality of the situation is that $15 is not the same across the board. To better guarantee the prosperity of its labor force, California lawmakers should focus on rectifying regional variability by controlling rent and dissolving food deserts in conjunction with adjusting the wage over time to reflect accurate purchasing power. If what the labor unions and the governor envisioned was an improved quality of life for wage-earners, they must also include matters of expense associated with income.
A fundamental difference between Left and Right concerns how each assesses public policies.  The Right asks, “Does it do good?”  The Left is more likely to ask a different question.  
Take the minimum wage, for example.  In 1987 the New York Times editorialized against any minimum wage.  The title of the editorial said it all:  “The Right Minimum Wage: $0.00”.:  There’s a virtual consensus among economists, “ wrote the Times’ editorial board, “that the minimum wage is an idea whose time has passed.  Raising the minimum wage by a substantial amount would price working people out of the job market.”  Why did the New York Times editorialize against the minimum wage?  Because it asked the question, “Does it do good?”
But 27 years later, this New York Times editorial page wrote the very opposite of what it had written in 1987 and called for a major increase  in the minimum wage.  In that period of time, the Times editors had moved further and further to the left, and was not preoccupied with  the question, “Does it do good?”  But with the question, “Does it FEEL good?”
And it “feels” good to raise poor people’s wage.
So then, why DO liberals support a higher minimum wage if it doesn’t do good?  Because it makes them feel good, about themselves.  “We liberals, unlike conservatives, care about the poor.”  Why do liberals support race-based affirmative action?  For the same reason:  It makes liberals feel good .. about themselves.   They appear to be righting the wrongs of historical racism.   And the same holds true for leftwing peace activism.  It‘s nice to think of oneself as a peace activist.  All this helps to explain why young people are so much more likely to be liberal than conservative:  They haven’t lived long enough to really know what DOES good.  But  they sure know what FEELS  good.
As society moves further and further to the Left, so does the preoccupation  with feeling good over doing good.  The world is getting worse and worse.  But many people are feeling better and better about themselves while it does.
Nothing comes for free.
People in favor of simply raising the minimum wage to make poor people less poor, are taking the lazy approach to what would be the equivalent of wanting a new TV, but you can not afford the cost of a TV, so you just buy it on credit…the “true” cost of that TV will come back and haunt you some day.
When Detroit went broke, almost all news stories were lamenting the fact this did not happen overnight. Yes, we let unions go crazy and companies simply were feed up and all those car manf. jobs went overseas – probably never to return again. Only stupid people and mealy-mouthed politicians think you turn a knob to a higher setting for min wage and problem is solved. If $15/hr is not a realistic price to pay for certain jobs, then this is simply not going to be a long term solution. 
Welcome to LA – the Detroit of tomorrow
The raise of this wage will serve only the estate income tax board for a short while before people and businesses move out of CA to less expensive place to live and work, like Texas. The minimum wage is not a wage that was designed to be livable. It is designedto mm avoid child labor law violations for kids in part time, non skilled, entry level work.
No way should a hiusekeeper, or burger flipper, for example, get paid more than someone in a skilled labor job, such as the US military, paramedics, etc…. 
The cost of living will soon increase dramatically thus running some business out of business or out of the state.
Gov Brown has initiated the continued economic fall of CA.

Since its opening six months ago, contemporary art museum The Broad has taken the art world by storm. Located downtown, The Broad is across from the Museum of Contemporary Art and next to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Its most noticeable feature is the long line, which wraps around the building and primarily consists of millennials. As the Los Angeles Times recently reported, the average visitor to The Broad is 32 years old. Meanwhile, according to the National Endowment for the Arts, the average national museum attendance age is 46. The Broad is redefining museum demographics and drawing in an audience for the arts that has not been tapped into before by primarily appealing to potential visitors via social media, a move that other museums should follow.
The Broad’s extraordinary success with a younger demographic can be tied to its unique utilization of social media. According to a survey conducted at The Broad, one in four visitors heard about the museum through someone else’s social media feed. The popular hashtag, #JEFFKOONSEXHIBIT, featuring Jeff Koons’ beloved Balloon Dog sculpture, for example, prompted millennials to quickly reserve their tickets months in advance or wait in a standby line for up to three hours.
Moreover, The Broad currently has 133,000 followers on Instagram and features various must-see art pieces. Each Instagram post includes a caption introducing a visitors service associate and each associate highlights a different artwork in the gallery and the significance behind it. By posting photos of artwork currently on display, The Broad can expand its accessibility to a diverse audience — users that consist largely of young adults, many of whom are students on a budget. Eli Broad, an American entrepreneur and co-founder of the museum, has always intended for The Broad to appeal to a wide array of people.
“It has always been our mission to introduce contemporary art to the broadest possible audience,” he told the Los Angeles Times. And social media has allowed him to accomplish this goal.
Other museums, like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Getty Center, are beginning to utilize social media and advertising events on Facebook that are open and free to students, and they should continue to do so to ensure accessibility to the arts for everyone.
Similar to The Broad, LACMA’s average visitor age is 40, which is also below the national average. LACMA’s Snapchat account drew attention by pairing photos of artworks with witty, culturally-relevant captions.
“Snapchat has, in a lot of ways, embodied one of the goals of LACMA to be relatable and approachable, to be a community space that’s owned by everybody,” Lucy Redoglia, the social media manager of LACMA told the museum’s blog Unframed. “You don’t have to be an art historian to follow us on Snapchat.”
A strong presence on social media equates to a larger number of potential visitors. As museums break down the walls of inaccessibility and unrelatability, a dialogue is being created between these institutions and diverse audiences. Social media has become a bridge for these two distinct groups.
It is essential for museums to draw in younger audiences and redefine what it means to visit a museum. The arts should serve everyone, and anyone should be able to visit a local museum and immerse themselves in the history and experiences of cultures past.

Last week, Snapchat released its first major update in about a year, and it did not disappoint. Besides adding over 200 new stickers, the app introduced new audio and video calling capabilities. It’s a direct challenge to other popular messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack, both of which have also recently focused efforts into expanding capabilities far beyond text communication. According to Forrester Research, 84 percent of time spent on smartphones by consumers is in just five non-native apps so these companies are all in a fierce battle for user attention. Whatever messenger app comes out on top will have ample opportunity to become the hub of a limitless amount of other businesses who have been shut out of that “top five” like food-delivery or ride-hailing. Snapchat’s latest update puts them one step closer to coming out on top.
Stickers
Snapchat is late to the game on stickers, but after using them for a week, I can’t imagine going back. The options include adorable animals with millennial-friendly phrases like “no chill” and “basic.” Pro-tip: type in a word like “love” in the text box before hitting the sticker button and you’ll be shown all the stickers related to it.

Video Chat
Snapchat’s previous version of video chat was a little awkward and felt more like an Easter egg than a core feature because of the required finger hold. This version is a lot easier to use. Press one button to make a call and your friend can either ignore it, join you or watch your stream. If you opt to join, you are both presented with fullscreen video streams of each other. However, you can swipe down to confine the stream to a small circle to send text or sticker messages in the compose field while still streaming.

Audio Calls
If you’re not satisfied with your normal phone for making audio calls, Snapchat can now handle that for you as well. This feature will be mostly useful for people already communicating in the app who just need to communicate with each other briefly.

Notes
Simply holding down on the video or audio button will start recording that type note that you can send to friends. Video notes automatically loop infinitely like GIFs but with optional sound.

As the semester begins to wind down and finals are just around the corner, you might be bogged down and feel unaccomplished or incomplete. If this is the end of your first year at USC and you have not yet achieved the Freshman 15, we’re here to help you out with a few suggestions to catch you up.
1) Binge watch and binge eat.
Starting a new season of Grey Anatomy or Breaking Bad? Start a new bag of chips or a tub of ice cream. To maximize effectiveness, try a chocolate or cookie dough flavor of ice cream and finish the tub by the third episode.
2) Enjoy a tasty breakfast.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It’s also the perfect time to pile on a tall plate of bacon and a stack of pancakes drenched in whipped cream and syrup. Fried eggs, donuts, danishes — anything with sugar or grease works.
3) Have Panda Express for the fourth time this week
It tasted good Monday, Tuesday and yesterday — might as well get it again today. Orange chicken and fried rice, please! 
4) Spudnuts.
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, 2 a.m. snack. Thank goodness Spudnuts is open 24 hours for us to enjoy.
5) Make a salad
Omit a bit of lettuce and try for one part lettuce to two parts ranch dressing and three parts bacon.
6) Go to Taco Bell and order one of everything
Chalupa, taco, enchilada, nachos — why pick when you can have it all?
7) Go to Blaze and make a custom order
Extra cheese, extra bacon, extra sausage and extra pepperoni sounds good.
8) Get a Cafe 84 crepe drenched in Nutella.
After a filling and nutritious dinner, you can’t leave the dining hall without indulging in a decadent Nutella crepe. And toss in a few sliced strawberries or bananas to get some nutrition in there too.
9) Stock your pantry with Mac & Cheese and freezer with frozen pizzas
Who has the time, money or effort to cook a healthy nutritious meal anymore? Chicken and veggies take way too long to cook. Have a homemade meal within 20 minutes with these easy and cost effective picks!
10) Breakfast at the dining hall — and for later.
What are they going to do with all those extra pastries and donuts on display once it hits the noon hour at the halls? Might as well not let them go to waste and toss a few in your backpack. Easy to snack on when you’re stressed or bored in class.
11) Enjoy nightly visits to CREAM. 
There are just too many cookie and ice cream flavor combinations at CREAM to skimp 
on experimenting with as many as you can. To try and taste all combinations by the end of the semester, stop by each night after you’ve had your mac and cheese or pizza. Peanut butter cookie and chocolate ice cream today, chocolate chip cookie with salted caramel ice cream tomorrow.
12) Pop into Jack in the Box and order $20 worth of curly fries. 
Who needs a burger when you can get so much more for your money with fries?
13) Sneak a few pieces of pizza at closing. 
We all know the “no food is allowed to be taken outside” of the dining halls rule. But if USC can afford to put on this big concert and if I’m getting charged an extra 2K in tuition next year, I think USC can manage losing a few slices of pizza I’m going to eat at midnight.
14) Swirl a soft-serve cone one foot tall at the dining hall. 
Gotta get your money’s worth everywhere when it comes to food. 
15) Can’t forget about your coffee. 
A regular coffee with five packets of sugar, a venti white chocolate mocha or a double chocolate chip frappucino from Starbucks should all help you start the day, not to mention get through it high on sweetness. There’s nothing like a sugar rush that will give you that boost of energy. 
Take up these suggestions and you’ll reach the Freshman 15 goal in no time, possibly along with diabetes. But if you’re trying to finish out the semester strong and healthy, omit all of the above suggestions. (Except for maybe Spudnuts and binge watching and eating — because what’s college without either?)
