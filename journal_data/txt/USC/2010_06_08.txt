A Chorus Line set itself up for easy billboard praise the moment the lyric “one singular sensation” was included in its signature song, and when it opened on Broadway in 1975, that’s exactly what the musical deserved to be called. Picking up nearly every award that mattered, including a Pulitzer Prize and an embarrassment of Tonys, A Chorus Line revolutionized the stage and went on to become the longest-running show in Broadway.
Not two decades after the musical closed on Broadway, co-choreographer Bob Avian and many of his original collaborators (creator Michael Bennett died in 1987) spearheaded a revival that opened in 2006. Now at the end of its national tour, that revival made its final stop at Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre June 1, where it will stay for nearly two weeks.
Billboards may still proclaim this A Chorus Line a singular sensation, but time has staled that praise, along with the show. There is a lot to cheer for in this step-by-step reproduction, much of which will still resonate with contemporary audiences, but — perhaps inevitably — it isn’t pitch-perfect.
Still, the chance to see this musical, which is as close to the original as we are ever likely to get, should surely be taken advantage of, if only to wonder at how incredible A Chorus Line really could be, and no doubt was in its time.

Played out like a real audition, A Chorus Line puts 17 professional dancers under the spotlight and on the line for a chance to win one of eight coveted spots in an unnamed new Broadway show. For two hours, these men and women struggle with their craft and with themselves as they try to impress the show’s director and win the job. The stage is bare. It’s only the dancers lined up center stage, the director’s disembodied voice and the iconic, mirrored panels in the background.
In 1975, the premise was irresistibly original. A self-reflexive exercise that captured the essence of desperation and self-doubt, the show gave a voice to generations of people either afraid or unable to face up to who they were and master that identity.
Today, that premise has been somewhat spoiled by our overconsumption of reality competitions like American Idol and So You Think You Dan Dance, which bear more than a passing resemblance to A Chorus Line and might be said to have their origins with it. Those kinds of shows are successful in large part because we derive some kind of vicarious pleasure through watching others make it or break it. But the chance of being privy to these experiences no longer has that same taste of privilege or intimacy, because we can see it every day.
Of course, we prefer to think that A Chorus Lines remains a much more powerful experience than American Idol, because it’s immediate. To a certain extent, that’s obviously true, and the show has the potential to plumb far greater depths of emotion. But, painful though it is to concede, the sentimental backstories of each of these performers — some of the men have sexuality issues, some of the women have daddy issues — are not unlike the prepackaged one-minute clips on So You Think You Can Dance that evoke a similar pathos.
The frankness with which the show examines sexuality is certainly admirable and still relevant, but the other issues are less startling. However, “At the Ballet,” sung serviceably, if not spectacularly, strikes a painful note that no amount of American Idol packages can approximate, and speaks beautifully to that fantasy realm to which all dreamers escape when their real life becomes too difficult to bear.
Each of the roles in A Chorus Line is based on the life of a real person, many of whom actually starred in the original production as versions of themselves. Being an extra level removed from reality by having actors play real people perhaps explains why some of the characters’ stories don’t seem real enough. The most believable stories are the least serious — vertically challenged Connie (recent USC graduate Catherine Ricafort, cute as a button) coping with her petite stature, tone-deaf Kristine (Hilary Michael Thompson, wonderfully gawky) trying and failing to hit a single note in “Three Blind Mice,” and augmented Val (Kristen Martin, a standout) singing about her newly augmented features in “Dance: Ten; Look: Three,” pure comedic gold.
The other women are mostly hits, with a few minor misses. Ashley Yeater’s Sheila — the self-proclaimed woman of the group — has attitude to spare, nails her priceless one-liners (“Can the adults please smoke?”) and mostly gets Sheila’s emotional past.
But it’s the stunning Rebecca Riker as Cassie, the closest there is to the female lead, who steals her scenes. She acts with her whole body and really understands her character, a woman who tasted stardom, tried to capitalize on it, failed and must now return to square one but is somehow content to be there. Her complicated relationship with Zach, the show’s director (Derek Hanson, unfortunately as dull as dishwater, but an exquisite dancer), is handled expertly. Only in her solo dance sequence does Riker not totally physicalize the music and her emotions, but the performance is top-notch.
If Cassie is the most important female, then Paul (Nicky Venditti) is the most important male. Troubled and fragile, Paul might be the emotional centerpiece of the show — his speech on growing up gay a dramatic masterpiece. The so-called “Paul monologue” has the potential to be shattering, but Venditti’s reading is unfortunately merely touching. He starts at fever pitch, leaving him no place to take the speech emotionally, and punctuates his manic recitation with sharp, forced half-laughs that might have proved effective if employed sparingly but in such excess simply grate on the ears. For a superb interpretation of the speech, seek out the excellent 2008documentary Every Little Step, which chronicles the casting process of the 2006 revival, and flip to Jason Tam’s audition. Be sure a box of Kleenex is on hand.
Venditti’s strained effort to capture a moment’s worth of true reality seems to be the problem with the entire show. If it were a show about a bunch of make-believe characters trying to overcome personal obstacles, it would be a total success, but the trouble is that it’s not. The mythos of A Chorus Line, but more importantly its firm basis in a stark, unglamorous reality, makes it impossible to forget that this story is supposed to approximate real life, and when it doesn’t, no matter how fine the dancing — which, it should go without saying, is spectacular — or the singing or the acting, we’re left feeling incomplete.
At the end of the show, when Zach announces his casting for the eight spots in the chorus line, there should be palpable anticipation in the air, but there isn’t. Nothing feels at stake. For all our reveling in these men and women’s formidable physical talents, somewhere along the line we stopped caring about their emotional struggles with identity, self-worth and regret, which in a show like this must be genuinely and unabashedly front and center.

Reported and promised many times over, the NCAA Infractions Committee again did not deliver its final verdict on USC’s infraction hearing from February of this year on Friday — as had been expected — leaving the university and the Trojan faithful on edge for at least a few more days.
Still waiting · The sword of Damocles hangs over first-year coach Lane Kiffin, pictured here at his introductory press conference in February.  - Tim Tran | Summer Trojan 
University officials, including President Steven Sample, Athletic Director Mike Garrett and former USC coach Pete Carroll, sat with the NCAA in Tempe, Ariz., earlier this year to discuss possible infractions surrounding USC’s athletic department. Under scrutiny at the meetings were allegations of improper benefits given to athletes, including former Trojans O.J. Mayo and Reggie Bush.
In similar situations in the past, the NCAA’s infractions board had delivered verdicts within eight to 12 weeks, prompting many to believe that the news would break before graduation in May. However, the end of the semester came and went without a decision, leaving national news sources scrambling to anticipate the announcement.
Two weeks ago, word came from a variety of sources, including Yahoo! Sports, that the committee was ready to release its findings, yet no announcement was made.
As May came to a close without a hint of a resolution, the first week of June again brought speculation that an announcement was imminent;  again, the promised day passed by without any decision or clarification from the NCAA.
Although difficult to anticipate, USC Assistant Vice president for Media Relations James Grant told USA Today that common protocol for such announcements includes 48-hour notice for the university before the committee makes an official announcement. In the past, the NCAA has also given the university in question a copy of the report up to 24 hours prior to the NCAA calling any news conference regarding the matter.
USC coach Lane Kiffin, whose football team will be at the center of the committee’s findings when the sanctions are announced, appeared on ESPN’s talk show Jim Rome is Burning Monday afternoon and told Rome that he had not heard any news regarding an impending announcement.
The allegations surrounding Bush stemmed from his relationship with sports marketing firm New Era Sports & Entertainment during his time at USC. Bush recently settled a civil dispute with New Era co-founder Lloyd Lake to avoid submitting a public disposition on the matter.
Mayo’s one year at USC has also stirred controversy because of the relationship among the former Trojan point guard Mayo, confidant Rodney Guillory and the university.
In January, USC took steps to stem the tide of the investigation by self-imposing sanctions on the men’s basketball team because of the controversy surrounding Mayo, forgoing the right to postseason play and reducing the number of basketball scholarships available.
Among its decisions, the committee will decide whether the self-imposed sanctions for the team were adequate or require a more severe punishment.
News outlets are reporting that the sanctions will be released this week, citing an anonymous source in the athletic department.
Seems awefully funny that once the dust had settled about the shady deals & goings on at U$C, all of their students disappeared. I really cannot blame them, I would be embarrased myself if the whole world suddenly knew the whole truth about my college & It’s corrupt ways! CHEAT ON!!
Typical U¢LA moron!!!!  GET A LIFE man, none of us care what you think of our athletic program.  If you want to keep accusing us for cheating then lets talk about your papa Sam Gilbert shall we?  We all know he paid recruits to come play for Johnny Woodie, no wonder why he won so many championships.  Does DeShaun Foster ring a bell?  Jimmy Harrick?
U-¢-L-A cheats cheats cheats!!!!
Get a Life RUIN
Here is todays joke of the day.
How do you know if Carroll, Kiffin, Garret, Bush or Mayo are lying?
Because their mouths moved!
I would like to respond to several people on this forum. 
  To Antonio, yes you do care or else you would not take the time to respond back in such an eloquent manner. I would not want to be associated with a university that is now synonomous with cheating & being corrupt, boy will Jay Leno be having fun at your expense over the next few weeks! I love to bash & gloat you on your website just the same way that your fellow students do it to us.
  To Lee, Thats a great story, so well written with a lot of human emotion, maybe you can sell it to the lifetime channel! If having pride about your school means having it’s most famous alumni as a double murderer, than I would much rather go to comunity college!
 To Trojan 88, I have a giant box of kleenex for you! By the way, change what you are wearing, denial does not look good on you.
To Die Bruins, You have some dam nerve, you guys get nailed & you want to blame us for it! Regarding the LA Times comment, they are 100% USC through & through, they must be getting a big time kickback from USC to be writing all of those nice & beautiful pieces about your invincible football team. 
Today was an awesome day because everybody now knows the truth about the most corrupt football program ever! Anyone & everyone associated with U$C will remember today as the day that the NCAA sodomized you guys with absolutely no lubrication!!!!!
What doesn’t surprise me, is the fact that those envious losers from Westwood didn’t hesitate to pounce on this issue. They gloat at us, and did likewise last year when Floyd resigned. Look at the LA Times and other media, read the comments, and you’ll see all this spite coming from, who else? Talk about inferiority complex huh? 
You guys are so pathetic! I don’t even want to spell out your name nor your school. Get a life.
Cheat on, ol USC
No Bowl game til 2-0-1-3
The NCAA is a HUGE part of the problem.  They are as criminal as the allegations they claim.   Instead of imposing sanctions on USC & the football program – they should add a rule:  NO PRO FOOTBALL CONTRACTS OFFERED TO STUDENT ATHLETES UNLESS THEY ARE VERIFIED GRADUATING SENIORS.  Reggie Bush IS NO representative of the USC football legacy. He isn’t even an alumni – he didn’t graduate.  He was obviously too “bratty” to stay in student housing.  What university should be expected to house “the family” unless it is in University family housing & they are married?  ‘SC has survived sanctions in the past – but you know what – they will just return to non-minority football student athlete recruitment.  Yes, the USC football team was historically non-minority.  But, give an athlete, or a minority athlete – a chance at a first rate education while playing the sport they enjoy and they blow it…do you know how many good, academically solid and/or talented students should receive scholarships because they actually graduate ?  Yes, punish Bush – take away “his” stats, “his” Heisman – and monetarily punish him – make him return the scholarship money USC gave “him”. Bush USED USC – the USC football program and the past, present & future football team members shouldn’t be victimized.  And people had problems because Carroll started recruiting stand-out non-minorities from faith-based academically excelling high schools for college student football players. JOHN WAYNE, PALMER, BOOTY, LEINERT, BARKLEY, CORPS – all student athletes representative of the USC football program and student athlete legacy.  Stop “Hating”….Reggie Bush ain’t USC football.  And true to form – ‘SC imposed their own sanctions in the basketball program – if they did something wrong – they are willing to be accountable.  USC should be applauded – as always.  1880 – 1925 no minorities in USC football.  In 1970 Sam Cunningham (USC) forced the Ole South to see they better start integrating college football programs by blowing Alabama out of the water.  Sounds like the ‘Ole South is screaming desegregation again by using the beauracracy of the BCS and NCAA.
You got the word now.   Kiffin Karma has made its grand appearance, USC fans!  Seems like scumball football coaches congregate at your citadel of learning, huh?  Pete Carroll is a saint compared to the piece of work you got on campus now, so you all had better get ready for multiple times on probabtion.  Kiffin Karma is a bitch, isn’t it???
Henry,
No matter what you say or how much you hate USC, no one who actually goes here is going to think “gee, you’re right”. We love this school and have so much pride in it. Our school is not defined by a football team. We are members of the Trojan Family, and that stays with you for life. We don’t produce “murderers and rapists”. We produce graduates such as Neil Armstrong, George Lucas, and John Wayne. We are one of the most selective universities in the countries, with applicants having the highest GPAs and SAT scores. We have one of the greatest marching bands in college history that has played at both the Grammys and the Academy Awards. Our women’s water polo and men’s tennis teams both won national championships this spring (WITHOUT cheating). We have one of the best alumni networks of any college or university. And the fact that we are located in downtown LA (which seriously isn’t bad, get off your Westwood high horse) and our school is still so competitive shows how strongly people want to become a Trojan. So say what you like, but the hundreds of thousands of USC students and alumni that love this school don’t care. Because believe it or not, the vast majority of us actually chose to come here for reasons BESIDE the football team. Go Trojans, and Fight On!
If I remember correctly, UCLA was kicking the shit out of U$C for 8 straight years until Pete “the Cheat” Carroll came to town with his arsenal of cheating tactics! Well today was payback day for all of the dirty & corrupt ways that have now been accepted as the norm at that college in South Central! Your college is now officially synonomous with cheating, unethical, unscrupulous, tainted, & lying ways.
Dearest Henry,
You are on the website of USC’s student newspaper, not the Daily Bruin or ESPN. It should be easy to deduce that most of the visitors to this website are going to be USC students, alumni, or fans.
So when posters like yourself or Tim come here with your insults, name-calling, and hyperbole,  I become very confused. Do you intend for us to repent for our “cheating” ways? Is your goal to make us feel guilty for the Pete Carroll era of USC football? Would you prefer that we forfeit our mascot just because of a few years of NCAA sanctions?
Alas, I cannot read your mind, but I can tell you this. We don’t care. Yes, we are disappointed for the bowl ban and yes, we feel that heads should roll for the athletic department’s inability to supervise its student-athletes. But we’re still Trojans and thus, aren’t going to care about your opinion of our alma mater.
Fight On!
Alex
So if the sanctions are handed down as expected, doesn’t that mean that Reggie accepted prohibited benefits from a sports agent?  If that is the case doesn’t that make him an ineligible player from the time he received the benefits?  If that is the case, doesn’t SC have to vacate the wins that he played in as an ineligible player?
Either USC needs to be completely exonerated or the wins need to be vacated as well if he is found to be ineligible.
I am not a Bruin.  I’m just sayin
Henry – even if USC is found to have cheated, at least they win NC’s. ucla cheats all teh time, and no one cares, because they still SUCK. How embarrassing for you and your like. 
FIGHT ON!
Rumor has it that USC will be banned from any bowl games for 2 years and lose 20 scholarships. I find this insane since anyone associated with the infractions isn’t even at SC anymore. So the NCAA is actually punishing people who had NOTHING to do with the incidents in question and are completely innocent of any wrongdoings. As for the negative comments about USC cheating, it sounds like sour grapes from a bunch of losers that have gotten their butts kicked by the men of Troy! Hold your heads high Trojans! FIGHT ON!
To Alum. D Day is coming tomorrow for U$C! Hopefully they should get what they ( even though you will not admit it) deserve which is loss of bowls for 2 years, loss of scholarships, and no television coverage. If they do skate, it will probably be because they probably “DONATED” some money to the higher ups in the NCAA. CHEAT ON ALUM! FYI, when your team starts to suck this year, you can donate Traveler to a nice glue company who will put him to good use!
This message goes out to As If, morals are morals & what is right is right just as wrong is wrong. Everybody & their dog knows that USC is nothing but a bunch of liars, cheaters & hypocrites! Funny how once the word came down that USC was finally going to be investigated that the first rat to jump ship was Pete ” The Cheat ” Carroll. Everybody knows that USC may produce great football players, but they also know that they produce murderers, rapists, cocaine & alcohol abusers, wife beaters, steroid abusers & it is also fitting to know that their college is located on the corner of Urine Ave & Drive By Shooting Way! Also,please do not talk bad about someone who has recently passed away. This alone speaks volumes of the type of low class individual that you really are! At least our coach did not abandon our team when the long arm of the law came calling!
To Henry: Get off this website and spew your venom somewhere else. Your slanderous statements are full of fabrications and slime. Your gutty little Bruin players have been caught red handed over the last few years and players have been suspended. Now that you have Slick Rick back, watch out for more recruiting violations. He is the master. He was shown the door in Washington and Colorado.
What a bunch of losers.
As if: It’s not just Bruins that are hoping that cheating sc will finally be dealt with and that their program will officially be exposed as the fraud that it truly is.  Fans, like me, around the country are hoping that the NCAA investigative committee made the right decisions and that for years to come sc is used as an example of what can happen to schools that disregard the rules and constantly cheat. 
Hopefully the football national championship whereby sc had to resort to cheating is taken away…that will send a strong message to the rest of the country regarding what a disgrace sc is to sports and to academia in general.
Time to hand out a severe punishment and end the culture of constant cheating. If you can’t play by the rules, don’t play at all.
Spoken like a true bRUIN.  Ever hear the saying, “those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones?”  It applies to your dead coach Wooden more than anybody.

As part of USC’s new partnership with the Alcohol Prevention Coalition, the university will begin offering optional online courses covering topics relevant to university life, such as sexual assault and mental health.
Incoming students are currently required to complete the AlcoholEdu course before their first week of classes, a requirement first implemented seven years ago.
The added courses are designed and offered through Outside the Classroom, the same entity responsible for AlcoholEdu.
MentalHealthEdu is available for faculty and staff, while SexualAssaultEdu is geared toward the student body.
Another course, GreekLife, targets specific drinking problems and conflicts found predominantly in the Greek community.
The coalition also plans on conducting studies on USC’s student body and behavior in order to develop more customized curriculum for the university.
While the university is not planning to require staff or students to complete the online tutorials, the new partnership vastly increases the amount of resources available to those wanting to delve further into potential social dilemmas.
Staff members will have the chance to attend semi-annual research summits and experts plan on conducting campus research on the school’s drinking culture, according to the Health Promotion and Prevention Services department.
“Outside the Classroom is sitting on one of the largest databases of college students in the world,” said Paula Swinford, director of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, to USC News. “We need to move this conversation forward, and we need more information about USC — the coalition is able to provide that.”
The AlcoholEdu tutorial provides basic information on what amount constitutes a single alcoholic drink, the meaning of blood alcohol content and how the body metabolizes alcohol. Through use of the online program, the university safely ensures that each incoming student will receive the same information on prevention and problem solving.
Students and staff can access the newly instituted programs beginning July 1.

As polls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday across the state, voters marked their ballots to select California governor and U.S. senator nominees.
At USC, there was very little trace of the frenzy of student activity that surrounded the 2008 presidential elections. The polling station at Marks Tower, which on Nov. 4, 2008, saw more than 300 students filter in to cast their ballots, was empty much of the day. As of 1 p.m., only two people had visited to vote — one student, who deposited a provisionary ballot, and a USC employee. At the time of print, only 5 students had voted.
Little boxes · Polling stations in and around USC, such as this one set up in Marks Hall, were not densely populated Tuesday. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
Jessica Overby, a senior at S.E.A. Charter Girls Academy in Los Angeles and a volunteer at the voting station, said she arrived at 5 a.m. Tuesday morning to set up for the day, and was surprised by the dearth of student voters.
“I thought it was going to be full of people,” she said.
Turnout was low across Los Angeles, however, in keeping with recent primaries. Only 27 percent of registered voters in Los Angeles voted for the 2006 gubernatorial primaries, according to the Los Angeles Times, which predicted another low turnout.
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and appointed chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, said the low turnout was nothing unusual.
“Turnout is always lower among all voters in the primaries,” Schnur said. “Turnout is always lower in a midterm election, than in a general election.”
Schnur said it’s reasonable to assume that students will come to the polls in larger numbers for the general election.
“We’ll see in November,” he said.

There are two great stereotypes about college students’ political engagement: the radical student protestor and the apathetic student who never votes. Two years ago, the former seemed like a fitting image. Now the latter seems more appropriate.
Thomas Curry | Summer Trojan
Primary elections never match the spectacle of general elections, and in California this year, the trend of a low voter turnout is repeating itself. In 2006, less than 30 percent of registered voters showed up to the polls, and 2010 looks to be equally as dismal. At USC, voter turnout has been marginal at best. As of 1 p.m. this Super Tuesday, only two people had voted on campus — a student, who turned in a provisional ballot, and a USC employee. Even with the lower number of students for the summer semester, this year’s turnout has been noticeably meager.
So what is to blame for the electoral apathy? Bland candidates? Lack of information available to the voters? A somehow smaller-than-usual student population on campus? None of the above. What is sadly keeping students from the polls is a return by politicians to all that is disheartening about politics.
With the primary election, student voters find themselves facing seemingly already-decided races, attack ads and extremist political movements that only serve to stoke anger aimed at both sides of the political spectrum.
On one hand, there is almost a sense of futility in the election. Going into the polls, the gubernatorial front-runners had already been set. Former Governor Jerry Brown ran virtually unopposed for the Democrats, while ex-eBay CEO Meg Whitman led the Republican candidates, in part thanks to an aggressive ad campaign. So essentially, it seemed pointless for voters, especially many new voters at USC, to even participate, because it was seemingly decided before they ever got the chance to cast their ballots.
Similarly, the media itself has been a source of much frustration. Instead of highlighting the issues, news channels seem to be merely highlighting the “front-runner” status of some candidates, hammering home that image into the minds of voters.
At the same time, there is a kind of “loud minority” sense of coverage going on. Radical political movements like the Tea Party or far left groups receive heavy news coverage, making it seem like almost all of America is in a rage over incumbents, policy and the state of the country, instead of just relatively small group of protestors. Instead of giving voters useful information on the issues surrounding the primaries, the media is simply painting an image of negativity in the political process.
The candidates themselves are not helping. So far, the run up to the primaries has been deluged with attack ads. Millions of dollars have gone into the ads, which essentially try to destroy the opponent’s credibility and image. Instead of ads focusing on themselves and promoting their accomplishments, the politicians in the California primaries have opted for an aggressive, destructive approach. While they could be raising their own pedestal, they are simply cutting their opponents’ in half — not exactly the most uplifting electoral strategy.
Then there is the disregard the candidates seem to have for student voters themselves. In the 2008 Presidential election, Obama and McCain tried to mobilize the youth vote. While it was not the deciding factor in Obama’s victory, his ability to reach out to and instill a sense of importance in the newly voting-eligible students certainly played a key role. If people grow up seeing nothing but antipathy toward themselves, then the only result is apathy.
There is a sad irony in the lower voter turnout. America is a nation that prides itself on free elections and teaches students about the importance of democracy. Yet, every election, general and primary, sees low turnout and disinterest on the part of youth voters.
There is no doubt that the general elections in November will have a much greater turnout. With more students back on campus, and student political groups able to organize support for the candidates, greater participation is sure to be expected.
However, if the trends of the primaries — negative ads, increasingly polarizing rhetoric and a lack of effort to really reach out to young voters — continue, then polling stations should not be surprised by a sudden drop in voter activity.
After all, if the political system feeds newly eligible voters with vitriol and arrogance, why would the voters feel the need to participate at all?

Joe, 
You’d be right if all demographics weren’t told who to vote for.
Joe you completely missed the point of the article.
So what’s the point of the article? That somehow, if candidates and activists were LESS passionate and expressive about their political ideas, teenagers would be MORE excited about going to vote? I sort of assumed everybody could see how stupid that was without having to say so.
Well quite frankly, children shouldn’t be voting anyway. If you expect the media to TELL you what’s important and who you should vote for, your vote is NOT helping your community, state, or nation. All you’re doing is serving some editor’s or producer’s agenda.
The civic duty of an American isn’t just to cast a vote, any vote. It’s to CARE about the consequences of elections, to SEEK information and KNOW what the candidates represent. It’s to cast an INFORMED vote. The 20% of registered voters who went to the polls yesterday were the 20% who knew and cared and realized that they had choices. 
The 80% sitting in their dorm rooms whining about how nobody told them who to vote for, are really doing all the rest of us a favor.

Two years ago, Forgetting Sarah Marshall made for another hit in the series of Judd Apatow-produced comedies. Penned by star Jason Segel, the film introduced audiences to the rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). With its witty jokes and subtle gags, Forgetting Sarah Marshall proved hilarious and showcased Brand’s scene-stealing Aldous as a breakout character. The success of the first film was apparently judged to warrant a spin off, but Get Him to the Greek essentially does away with almost all of the wit and subtlety of the movie that inspired it.
Make haste · In Get Him to the Greek, Jonah Hill’s Aaron Green (left) is charged with transporting vexing and washed-up rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to Los Angeles’ Greek Theatre for a special concert. - Photo courtesty of Universal Pictures 
With the music industry floundering, record executive Sergio Roma (Sean “P. Diddy” Combs) sends Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) to take rock star Aldous Snow to a 10-year anniversary concert in hopes of revitalizing record sales and Snow’s career. Aaron, a music enthusiast and fan of Aldous, jumps at the chance. The only problem: Aldous is back on drugs and proves impossible to control.
The film has an interesting premise, but ultimately fails because of clear shortcomings in the script. Whereas Segel’s blueprint for Forgetting Sarah Marshall kept things grounded and linear, director Nicholas Stoller’s film clearly tries to outdo itself at every turn with a series of absurd and increasingly unnecessary party scenes. By the third hedonistic montage, the gags have become so overblown that, while amusing at times, they diminish any elevated interest and make for a film that’s little more than a low-brow sideshow.
One problem is that the main characters seem almost like non-entities in the film. Hill’s Aaron is forgettable, simply serving as the target for a collection of over-the-top gags. His main arc, involving a distant girlfriend, feels inconsequential and uninteresting and never seems more than tangentially important to the film’s larger plotline.
Aldous, arguably the focus of the film’s premise, is more a vehicle for pointed comments on the music industry than the character he created in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Brand still manages to offer some of the film’s funniest lines — when not participating in the abuse of Hill’s character — and shows that a film about Aldous Snow could work, if handled properly.
Even the interaction between the two leads, in a film that is supposed to be a buddy comedy, falls flat. Hill and Brand, despite sharing multiple scenes, never really get a chance to bond: Aaron is usually more of a launch pad for Aldous’ next adventure than in that of a companion.
One notable part of the film is Combs’ Sergio. Loud, abrasive and inclined toward manipulation, Sergio is possibly the perfect example of a hit-or-miss character. When his jokes fail — and they do for half of the film — they fail miserably. Yet when he is funny, he manages to come close to Brand’s level of humor.
What ultimately brings down Get Him to the Greek is its focus; instead of centering on the buddy-film dimension or even just the characters, the film attempts to satirize the entire music industry. This unwieldy scope hurts the film from the start — the first 10 minutes are a cross between heavy exposition and out-of-left-field twists, turning Aldous from a world famous musician to a near has-been. From there, the rocker is saddled with a manipulative father, a renewed drug addiction and a relationship with a pop star.
Stoller seemed set on lampooning the music industry, but makes his targets too ambitious. Instead of scathing commentary — although there is a great comment on Metallica and Napster — the film delivers half-hearted shout-outs to various music industry clichés and wastes the character of Aldous by dragging him through trope after tired trope.
Similarly, the film offers an increasingly random series of cameos that serve no real purpose in the film other than padding. Everyone from Paul Krugman to the Harry Potter franchise’s Tom Felton enters and exits in scenes that could have just as easily been left out.
It’s not that Get Him to the Greek is an unfunny film. Brand and Combs offer some great laughs, and when the satire of the music industry works, it is very effective.
However, Stoller’s ambitious and absurd approach to the film ends up wasting much of the Aldous Snow’s potential as a character. In this case, Get Him to the Greek would have probably benefited from keeping in mind that too much of a good thing can indeed be bad, if the good thing is the witty, understated comedy of Forgetting Sarah Marshall that made Snow the breakout character that he is. Here, he is simply a vehicle for satire that fails.

Like most newly formed bands attempting to secure a place in the contemporary music industry, Delta Spirit sought to re-establish itself as a band and build on its initial success with the release of a purposeful sophomore record. The band’s first album, 2008’s Ode to Sunshine, was hailed as a success by fans and critics, and the band was singled out for its unique, multi-instrumental style.
The follow-up result, History from Below, definitely proves that Delta Spirit will be a talented, lasting force in the indie music scene, not a forgotten buzz band like so many of its peers.
“911,” the album’s opening track, begins with upbeat, crisp acoustic guitar strumming right before diving straight into an equally energetic drum beat and alternative country guitar riff. Lead vocalist Matthew Vasquez passionately sings Say good morning to my friends / Oh my lord, 6 a.m. As the song serves primarily to kick start a lively, emotional album, the lyrics are fitting.
Although the rest of the song’s lyrics are not quite peppy or optimistic, the music remains vibrant, demonstrating the band’s consistent ability to craft upbeat, joyous indie pop grounded by meaningful, emotion-driven lyrics.
History from Below’s impressive first single, “Bushwick Blues,” builds on the momentum of its opener, resulting in a song similar to Ode To Sunshine’s popular songs “Trashcan” and “People C’mon.” The song was a clear choice for the first single; it showcases the band’s vibrant energy while playing its unique brand of indie rock.
The album’s momentum stops suddenly on the third track. The slow but soulful “Salt In The Wound” recalls folk singers from the 1960s and ’70s, and although the music isn’t quite as fast or lively as the first two songs, the band’s energy and talent is definitely demonstrated.
The song begins modestly enough: An acoustic guitar dominates the deceptively simple folk song at first, but eventually the sound builds to include crashing cymbals, pounding drums, steady piano and soaring backing vocals.
Songs like “Ransom Man” and “Ballad of Vitaly” are also reminiscent of early, simple folk songs with a modern, livelier twist. The latter is the album’s closing track, an eight-minute, slow-building song that suddenly decays into a chorus of disconnected synths and organs with heavy reverb to close the album.
Delta Spirit is from Southern California, but the band’s music makes it sound like its members could easily be from the deep South. Vasquez has a slight twang in his voice, comparable to singers in alternative country and folk bands such as the Avett Brothers. The guitars and drums have a similarly country-like feel, with the addition of a modern indie rock influence. An indescribable blend of rock, folk, indie, alternative country and other genres is a common motif throughout much of History from Below.
In fact, without a song like “Golden State” or some quick Internet research to tip you off, it would be difficult to peg the band as Southern Californian, if only because of its heavy country and folk influences. In the song, Vasquez sings The Golden State has been my home / But I place my stake / To roam and to rake. With “Golden State” the band forsakes typical Californian sounds in favor of the folk roots and country vibes of Middle America.
History from Below does its job to secure Delta Spirit a firm spot in the collective consciousness of indie rock fans by demonstrating that the band’s debut was, in fact, the product of truly talented artists capable of evolving and creating enjoyable music. The energy of their first album is present on the sophomore release, and even shines through on the slow-paced folk songs.
Its soulful, twangy feel might initially make it hard to identify where the band is from, but there’s no question that Delta Spirit will be around for a while.

Brendan Bradley has known homelessness. But unlike the majority of those who struggle to find shelter or a place to sleep, the 27-year-old North Carolina native’s greatest struggle stemmed from the challenge of extracting comedy from hardship.
On location · Brendan Bradley (middle) and Erik Smith (right) shot portions of Squatters in New York to enhance the series’ authenticity. - Photo courtesy of Brendan Bradley 
Bradley is the creator, writer and director of Squatters, a new comedic web series on Dailymotion.com that follows the exploits of two 20-something Manhattanites who, galvanized by increasingly hard-to-ignore eviction notices and mounting frustrations with the very institution of paid residency, seek to live rent-free for one year in New York City’s most aspired-to borough.
The concept for the show came to Bradley out of his own experiences making do without the security and peace of mind afforded by a steady place to live.
“I was couch surfing in Los Angeles when I first moved here,” Bradley said. “I’d lived in New York City for six years, and I had spent a little bit of time ‘between places.’”
Crafting humor from a subject traditionally treated with utmost sensitivity posed a definite challenge for Bradley while conceiving the series — his mission to derive laughs from homelessness would have to be handled very delicately.
“I had this idea to have a character that’s in and out,” Bradley explained. “It grew and grew until I was like, ‘Well, you know, homelessness isn’t very funny, so what would be a way that two guys could be essentially homeless and it have kind of a challenge element and kind of a fun element to it.’ And that’s where the stupid bet came from.”
The stupid bet Bradley is referring to was one made between his character Hank Pitman and Hank’s best friend and pre-eviction roommate, Alex Selkirk, played by Erik Scott Smith, Bradley’s real-life friend and co-star in the short film Weak Species. In the pair’s efforts to outlast one another without violating the three stipulations of the challenge — no paying for a place to sleep, no staying with friends or family, no leaving Manhattan — the first two episodes of the series have already found Alex constructing an elaborate bed-like contraption under the desk in his cubicle and Hank hunkering down for overnight prison stints and engaging in impromptu adult slumber parties.
Since beginning work on the series, Bradley knew that there was only once place a show like Squatters could be set.
“People talk about New York City being the hardest place to live, and that kind of ‘if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere mentality,’” Bradley said. “All of us think about rent, no matter where we are in the world. But especially in New York City, you know, where you’re paying a lot more for a lot less. And people get creative as it is with sleeping arrangements in New York, so I thought that that would be the perfect playground for [the show].”
Though certain segments were filmed in Los Angeles, where Bradley and Smith currently reside, a good deal of the show was filmed on location in the Big Apple.
“We filmed a lot of interior stuff in Los Angeles,” Bradley said, “but then we went to New York for a week and filmed all of the exterior stuff, the subway stuff and then a few of the actual, very New York apartments.”
Bradley’s previous work on web-based projects like Comedy Central’s The Legend of Neil and the improv-oriented Apocalyptic Playground would suggest that he might have written Squatters with the Internet in mind as a front-runner candidate for a potential medium, but Bradley said that wasn’t the case.
“I wrote it as a pilot — the first three episodes are actually a single television pilot, like a standard half-hour comedy,” Bradley said. “But just because the industry — the way it is right now — seems like the webspace is a great place for development and experimentation, and I’ve had so much success producing web content on a commercial level that I basically was like, this is the perfect platform to introduce this storyline.”
Securing the eight-episode contract Squatters currently has with video streaming website Dailymotion didn’t happen until three of the short webisodes had already been shot and put together. Bradley was open to the idea of pitching the product as either a television pilot to networks or a web series to online platforms.
In addition to being tapped by Dailymotion to create the website’s first original comedic series, Bradley and the Squatters crew were pleasantly surprised around the same time by talk radio personality Frank Kramer’s interest in the project.
Kramer, of 790 KABC’s hugely successful 9 a.m.-to-noon program Frosty, Heidi and Frank, had previously worked with Bradley on an advertising campaign that aired on KTLA and the Dodgers Stadium Jumbotron promoting the talk radio trio’s arrival to AM airwaves. Kramer stepped on board in the capacity of executive producer after being impressed by the work that had already been done on the series. His involvement in Squatters marks the first time he has tried his hand at producing visual content, let alone for the Internet.
Bradley said he’s grateful for all of Kramer’s support, both creatively and financially.
“He was actually incredibly supportive,” Bradley said. “He knew the script, he knew the stories, he’d seen the first three episodes and so he really trusted us to basically do more of the same … as long as we don’t go buck wild.”
According to Bradley, Kramer oversaw the production process in a sort of grandfatherly spirit, and despite Kramer’s significant investment in the project, his presence was never heavy-handed.
“He’s the big daddy,” Bradley said. “He gave us an allowance and said, ‘Kids, don’t get arrested, but have a lot of fun.’ And so we went out and had a lot of fun and made a good show.”
New episodes of Squatters come out Mondays on Dailymotion.com.

Oh, the joy of living in Los Angeles.
From the glitz and glamour to the A-list celebrities to the high-profile athletes, there is nothing better than Hollywood, right?
The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Dodgers are good enough for this town, and so are the USC Trojans — you might as well call them the professional football team of L.A.
Three storied franchises, three rich histories and three teams characterized by success — especially the USC football program, which has been nothing short of spectacular in the past decade. But even then, that might be an understatement.
And beneath all this winning, there is talent. There are players that ooze potential and star power.
Hopefully more isn’t found behind the scenes. The NCAA sanctions have left a dark cloud of uncertainty over the program and I can only hope that the flow of talent in the next couple years from five-star recruits, freak-of-nature athletes and lightning quick running backs does not slow down.
But behind the hyped hysteria of sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, the jaw-dropping jukes of freshman running back Dillon Baxter and the return of coach Lane Kiffin lies one player who quietly goes about his business.
That’s where senior quarterback Mitch Mustain comes in.
His operation at Howard Jones Field is ever so sly and his undercover duties are overshadowed largely by well, pretty much everybody else.
Beneath the big lights lies a competitor just itching to play and prove his worth.
Then again, he might not need to.
Mustain is a proven winner. Dating back to his glory days in high school, he has compiled a 61-2 record.
And to me, that is definitely worthy of at least getting some playing time.
He has an unblemished record in college, compiling eight victories as a freshman at Arkansas. What more could you ask for?
Well, his former coach, Pete Carroll, was asking for something more, though it’s not clear what.
Many feel the job was already decided and given to Barkley ever since he stepped foot onto the hallowed grounds of Heritage Hall.
Maybe the media couldn’t help but express their excitement over Barkley because they were in the same boat as Carroll — they hailed him as the savior for the Trojans.
I’m not going to sit here and write that I have a solution to the problem, but as a fan last year, I realized something wasn’t right.
Maybe it was the 9-4 record the Trojans compiled. Hey, maybe we’re spoiled here at USC and expect nothing less than championships, but if it’s broken, do something about it.
Even when Barkley sat out one game at Washington, Carroll still chose to start former quarterback Aaron Corp. We all know how that one turned out — but I don’t recall any mention of Mustain.
And though it is only speculation at this point, what if Mustain started?
Think about this: We could have had Mustain start for two years and let Barkley harness his skills and potential in practice to prepare for the future, beginning his career at USC as just a redshirt sophomore.
Sounds reasonable, doesn’t it?
Sure, Carroll might have sacrificed a year in hopes of reaping some type of reward.
But if you think about it, maybe a 9-4 record, speculation about violating NCAA sanctions and a dark cloud hanging over USC’s championships and former Heisman trophy winner is kind of refreshing actually.
Now that Kiffin has returned, Mustain has been given every opportunity to compete for a leading role.
Corp transferred to Richmond in the offseason and Barkley was dealing with a bruised hand during spring practice. And though ESPN’s College Football Live rates Barkley as “irreplaceable,” I’d beg to differ.
I think the Trojan coaches agree with me too because quarterbacks coach Clay Helton said they’d be “comfortable” handing the reigns over to Mustain.
Though not too many people expected Barkley to be supplanted by Mustain, there is still a chance that perhaps the role will be reversed.
“Mustain really wanted to come and compete and show that he’s a big-time quarterback who can help the team in any way,” Helton told ESPN. “We were very proud of the way Mitch responded during the spring.”
Well, now that spring is over and summer is almost in full swing, I’m excited for the start of fall practice.
I’m waiting for this saga to play out. Even though there are probably a lot of supporters for Barkley, I support you, Mustain.
I know that, given a chance to succeed, you will do exactly that.
Your record in high school and in college shows it.
Your spring practice performances, including 19 of 29 passes completed for 299 yards and five touchdowns in the spring game, show it.
And your dedication to your craft — despite being relegated to backup duty behind Barkley and Mark Sanchez before him — shows it.
I’m hoping for a perfect Hollywood ending to this familiar script.

Well written, Trevor! Love reading your articles! =)
Mitch should have started last year, USC accepted his skills from Arkansas, he red-shirted, paid his dues so to speak.  Barkley was not ready although I give him credit for the guts he displayed in beating OSU, his biggest game of last year.
Of all the USC personnel mysteries emerging game-to-game last year, of all the puzzling Carroll behaviors, the disregard for Mitch Mustain is the deepest, most puzzling of them all.  Given his chance I foresee many happy endings for both the Trojans and Mustain this fall.
had Kiffin arrived last year it would have been interesting to watch how the QB competition would have gone under him..  Right now Barkley is clearly the starter because he has that one year.

Despite a disappointing 2009 season resulting in an Emerald Bowl appearance, the departure of Pete Carroll to the NFL, and an ongoing NCAA investigation regarding a possible “lack of institutional control,” USC hasn’t stopped reeling in high-end talent on the gridiron.
In February, the Trojans, led by new head coach Lane Kiffin and highly regarded defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron, signed the nation’s top-ranked recruiting class of 2010, according to the popular recruiting service Rivals.com.
Now, four months later, Kiffin is looking to bring in another highly rated 2011 class.
Just last week, Centennial (Bakersfield, Calif.) quarterback Cody Kessler announced that he will attend USC, marking the seventh player in the class of 2011 to commit to play college ball for the Trojans — the most of any other Pac-10 school.
Furthermore, Kessler also becomes the second quarterback commitment for the Trojans, joining Mater Dei’s Max Wittek, who made a similar announcement in April. Both players will compete with incoming freshman Jesse Scroggins to replace current signal caller Matt Barkley as the starter when he becomes eligible for the NFL draft following his junior season in 2011.
But the competition doesn’t seem to be fazing either commit.
“I love to compete. I have no problem with that,” Kessler told WeAreSC.com last week. “I know Max is a good quarterback and there’s a reason USC offered him. For me, I was making the best decision on what was best for my future and not worrying about any other players.”
Similar sentiments can be seen elsewhere, as players are not shying away from joining the Trojans’ talent-rich program. In the month of May alone, the Trojans received verbal agreements from four-star prospects defensive end Jalen Grimble (Las Vegas), wide receiver Victor Blackwell (Santa Ana, Calif.) and linebacker Tre Madden (Mission Viejo, Calif.) — all ranked in the Rivals.com list of the top 250 prospects.
Grimble is the cousin of class of 2010 signee Xavier Grimble, a tight end. Blackwell plays with Wittek for the Monarchs of Mater Dei.
Such a mindset shouldn’t come as a surprise to Kiffin, as the 34 year-old head coach told the media in February that the difference in attitude between recruits who chose to come to USC instead of other schools, such as UCLA, was more than apparent.
“I watched it over the weekend, just to see if it’s the same, and it’s really still the same,” Kiffin said in his signing day press conference. “I guess we waste time continuing to recruit them. We know within the first 10 minutes whether they’re the type of guys that want to play here or there.”
Kiffin and his counterpart at UCLA, Rick Neuheisel, continue to compete for many of the same Los Angeles-based recruits.
Thus far, the jewel of the 2011 class appears to be Crenshaw High School running back De’Anthony Thomas, who committed to the Trojans in May through a much-publicized Facebook wall post that read “i made my decision… im a trojan.”
Thomas chose USC over a host of other schools, including UCLA. He is the highest rated running back and fifth-overall player in the class of 2011 according to Rivals.com. Though he might be a bit undersized at 5 feet 9 inches and 160 pounds, he makes up for his smaller build with speed and shiftiness. The Crenshaw High School product, who ran all over A-teams last season on his way to recording 902 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns and leading his team to a state title game, has been clocked running a 4.41 in the 40-yard dash — a time that is actually faster than departing tailback Joe McKnight’s.
McKnight, a fourth-round selection of the NFL’s New York Jets in April, ran an official 4.47 at the Combine this offseason.
Provided the NCAA does not severely punish USC when it releases the results of its four-year investigation, the Trojans could once again have another top-five recruiting class next February.

With the last tee times of the day, the No. 10 USC men’s golf team knew what it had to do in the third round of the NCAA championships.
If it had any hope of making up an eight-stroke, second-round deficit to qualify for the eight-team match play, the Trojans had to go low.
After a bright start to the round during which the team climbed to within three strokes of the final match play spot, the Trojans ultimately fell short, finishing six strokes away from keeping their season alive.
“We had things going for a little while, but it was too little, too late,” junior Matt Giles said.
USC finished in 15th place at 10 over par during a wet week at the Honors Course in Chattanooga, Tenn. Augusta State captured the national title with a 3-1-1 victory over Oklahoma State on Sunday.
“It didn’t feel like anyone on our team played that great,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “But we shouldn’t finish 15th in a field of 30. We should have made a better run at the top eight. Everybody could have found seven strokes somewhere — I know that.”
T.J. Vogel, who was named a freshman All-American, led the Trojans, shooting 1 under par for the week (74-72-69) and finishing in a tie for 25th.
“T.J. had a great 11-hole stretch where he played the golf that I think he is capable of playing,” Zambri said about Vogel’s first 11 holes of the final round, which he played 6 under par. “But even T.J. could have played better than he did.”
Sophomore Steve Lim shot 1 over par (74-72-71) and placed in a tie for 41st.
Giles, a two time All-American, concluded a frustrating season by shooting 4 over par (73-75-72) and tying for 64th.
“It wasn’t a great season for me individually, which is disappointing,” Giles said. “Last year I played well and it would have been nice to replicate that again this year. That would have helped out the team.”
After the final round, Giles announced he will skip his senior season at USC and turn professional.
“I’ve known that Matt was going to do that for almost a year and a half now, so I’m not at all surprised,” Zambri said. “He chips and putts well enough and he has enough length off the tee to play professional golf, but he just kind of got a little lost tee-to-green and he has to figure that out quickly if he wants to go out and make some money against pros.”
Freshman Martin Trainer shot 75-71 in the opening two rounds but struggled on the final day, posting 78 and slipping to a tie for 95th.
“I need to get a better short game, work on my putting a lot,” Trainer said. “That’s what killed me this week.”
Freshman Sam Smith finished in a tie for 111th by shooting 74-75-77.
The Trojans ended the season without a tournament victory, either as a team or individually.
“There was definitely enough talent,” Zambri said. “With Matthew Giles not having a good year for us, that really hurt. We had a returning first-team All-American that just didn’t play that well. Our freshmen were talented but they’re young.”
Giles still noticed the Trojans’ improvement over the season.
“The way we were playing at the start of the year, there was no way we could contend for a national championship,” Giles said. “But by the end, everyone had gotten a little bit better, the freshmen had that experience of playing college golf and our results showed that at the end of the year.”
With four of five starters returning for USC, Zambri said the team should be better next season.
“You move on but you move on with a plan,” Zambri said. “As long as they have a plan to improve and catch up with these kids who are beating us, then we’ll be fine.”
“We can use this as a learning experience,” Trainer added. “Next time we’re in the hunt for a big tournament we can really do damage and maybe someday win a national championship.”
