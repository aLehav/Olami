Listen to “Is Rushing Part of Your First Amendment Rights?” on Spreaker.
Following the lead of other top tier universities, USC mandated in 2018 that first-time students must wait to establish a GPA to rush Greek organizations. A few fraternities and sororities sued the school over this policy — and lost. Now, the courts have reversed the decision, and the policy’s fate is uncertain. Music by Joakim Karud.

If you’ve tuned into a USC football game on the radio, you have probably heard the raspy tone and signature “How do you do?” of announcer Pete Arbogast, who has been the voice of Trojan football for the past 23 years. As Arbogast sits in the press box many Saturday afternoons equipped with his headset and binoculars, he calls the radio play-by-play for USC football in his trademark style.
Growing up in Los Angeles, sports was Arbogast’s first love. He never missed listening to Vin Scully’s “It’s time for Dodger baseball!” or Chick Hearn’s play-by-play broadcasts of Lakers games. But the 64-year-old, who now holds the record for most broadcasts of USC football games on Los Angeles radio of anyone in history, first fell in love with USC football at just 8 years old after growing up with a radio host for a father. 
Arbogast went on to attend college at USC, and he said it was his enthusiasm for USC football that led to his unique rasp on the radio.
“I was sitting in the Coliseum stands next to the [USC] band, screaming at football games and drinking too much beer,” Arbogast said. “It ruined my vocal chords to the point where I sound like this now. My dad has a higher-pitched comical voice, but I got this. Darn.” 
Arbogast’s gee-whiz attitude is known far and wide, especially among the Trojan faithful.
“The announcer is the one that’s bringing the action and putting it in [their] own words – — the eyes and ears of the games,” said Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Jeff Fellenzer, a longtime friend of Arbogast’s. “You are painting a picture. It’s a powerful dynamic that exists and a relationship that starts. That person has been in your home, your car, in your living room. [Arbogast’s] impact is significant.” 
During his 300th game announcing for USC, Arbogast’s voice raised in excitement as former USC cornerback Ajene Harris ran back an interception for a touchdown against the University of Colorado last season.
“How do you do!” Arbogast said loudly into the mic. 
This is one of Arbogast’s most popular phrases. But, surprisingly, he didn’t invent it himself. After listening to Scully announce on the radio as a kid, Arbogast was able to adopt one of Scully’s lines and make it his own.
“Vin Scully actually loaned that line to me,” Arbogast said. “I was the public address announcer at Dodger Stadium for a few years. Every once in a while, [Scully] and I would have lunch together. When I asked him if I could borrow his phrase to use on my broadcast, he said, ‘It’s all yours. I’ll never use it again.’”
Arbogast says the biggest accomplishment of his career so far was being inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame, joining the ranks of legends such as Hearn and Scully.
Arbogast has a great voice, but many say that he boasts an even better character. His job as announcer only takes up 13 days of his year, so Arbogast consistently looks for meaningful ways to occupy the rest of his time.
For the last 50 years, Arbogast was in charge of 300 kids in a full-time position running the YMCA’s youth basketball team in Santa Monica. Although he retired from the job last year, Arbogast continues to give back by spending his time away from the press box volunteering.
Arbogast is an active volunteer of the No One Dies Alone program run by Providence Saint. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, where he comforts patients who only have days or hours to live. While many people know about his job as USC’s longtime football announcer, his volunteer work was relatively unknown until Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke wrote a moving column about it in August 2018.
“Did any of us know this? Did he ever talk about it?” said Larry Stewart, the Times’ longtime TV-radio sports columnist who sits on the Southern California Sports Broadcasters board with Arbogast. “Did he ever pat himself on the back or bump his chest and say ‘Do you know what I’m doing?’ It shows you that he just [volunteers] to be a good guy.”
Arbogast’s compassionate nature not only serves the patients with whom he spends time, it extends toward everyone around him.
“He’s not Pete the USC guy, he’s just a gentle, compassionate giant named Peter,” said Erin Pickerel, the volunteer services coordinator at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. “He brings this calmness, this assurance. You can feel his presence.”
While Arbogast’s broadcasting career is far from over, he has also started writing three books, including one about his time at USC. But while Arbogast admits that he is a die-hard sports enthusiast, he says he finds that some of his greatest joys are his volunteer job and other opportunities that are unaffiliated with sports.
“Maybe the best part of it all is that I am happy, and that’s not an easy thing to get anymore these days,” said Arbogast. “I’m a pretty happy guy.”

The Viterbi Startup Garage is teaming up with Amazon’s Alexa Fund, the venture investment division of Amazon, to build the next generation of technological entrepreneurs. The partnership, which will begin in October, will focus on voice technology as part of the organization’s Fall 2019 cohort.
This year, student- and alumni-run companies selected to participate in the accelerator program — especially ones affiliated with USC — will have the opportunity to connect with Amazon mentors and investors in a 12-month residency ending on USC’s “Demonstration Day.” 
VSG Director David Eastman believes that the technology giant will be “a big help” with startups in the organization. 
“That Amazon [Innovator in Residence] is not just going to be working with the Amazon or the voice-enabled teams,” Eastman said. “They’ll be working with all the teams to give Amazon’s perspective, and because many technologies and hardware and software have a voice-enabled component to them, Amazon’s going to be assisting in that realm with all of our teams.”
The Viterbi Startup Garage was founded in 2013 as an entrepreneurship incubator by the USC Viterbi School of Engineering alongside venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and the United Talent Agency. 
The VSG is one of many university organizations dedicated to innovation and start-up ideas. James Bottom, project director of Blackstone Launchpad USC, another incubator on campus, believes the Amazon Alexa Fund and Alexa Fellowship will help university-affiliated startups.
“This generation should be the most entrepreneurial we have ever seen,” Bottom said. “In many industries, the days are gone where people would work for a company their entire career. We’re finding that more and more individuals are starting their own companies – smaller companies – so they can find ways to build their own businesses and grow.” 
VSG gives USC engineers and entrepreneurs the resources to specialize in deep technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. Additionally, VSG provides access to resources across Los Angeles, such as a communal work space, legal and fundraising support and additional training. Students who join participate during a one-year residence program.
Though Amazon has partnered with the Viterbi School of Engineering on campus programs such as sponsoring natural language processing research at the USC Information Sciences Institute and the Amazon Alexa Voice Prize, this is the company’s first partnership with VSG.
Greta McAnany, a USC alumnus and founder of the startup firm Blue Fever, said the Garage provided her company with mentorship and support. To date, the VSG has sponsored 21 startups.
“They gave us the time, space and resources to grow as people,” McAnany said. “We were really given a lot of advice and mentorship and then the time to figure it out, which I think is the most valuable when you’re in a startup, because time is always of the essence.”

Center for the Political Future welcomes three new fellows this semester to teach two-unit courses on today’s political and media climate from a variety of viewpoints and encourage political discourse among students in and out of the classroom. 
Joining the University this semester are Ann Klenk, former senior and co-executive producer of “Hardball with Chris Matthews”; Adam Nagourney, Los Angeles Bureau Chief for The New York Times; and Ron Christie, former policy adviser to the Bush administration.
Co-Directors of CPF Bob Shrum and Mike Murphy, faculty from the Department of Political Science and other CPF staff selected these fellows for their diversity in background and experience, which includes political consulting and journalism. Shrum said that he hopes the fellows will provide students with fresh perspectives.
“We want partisan balance,” Shrum said. “We want people who are interested in engaging with students. And we want people who either have had some experience teaching a course, which a lot of them have.”
Titled “Producing History,” Klenk’s course dives into the journalistic process  and how it informs citizens, especially in today’s political climate with claims of “fake news.” Klenk is one of the only female executive producers in primetime television.
“Right now the press, especially cable news, is under a lot of fire by a lot of different politicians in this country,” Klenk said. “I thought it would be challenging to come to USC to teach a class [titled] Producing History, because I think that is what television is about. It’s a big challenge, but I think the time is right for young people, the next generation of journalists, in particular, television journalists, to find out exactly how a television news show is put together.”
According to Klenk, her course will also cover topics like investigative reporting, pop culture in political television and the importance of diversity in newsrooms, and will feature guest speakers including key women in media and journalism like Izzy Povich, the vice president of CNN.
Nagourney’s course, “2020 Primary in Real Time,” will follow the primary elections. His course also features several guest speakers who talk about their careers and experiences reporting on past elections. 
Nagourney, who previously served as the Times chief national political correspondent, said his course will look at how election processes have changed and developed over time, including the process by which parties choose their candidates.
Christie’s course is titled “Interest Group Politics” and will teach students about the different roles individuals and organizations have in the political process. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Christie subtitled the course as “How Washington D.C. works on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.” Beyond just discussing politics along partisan lines, Christie wants students to understand the different roles people play in politics, and how students can get involved.
“What I want to do is to allow students who are interested in public service the opportunity to delve deeper into public service,” Christie said. “What does it mean to work in policy? What does it mean to work in politics? And hopefully inspire those who might be considering a career in public service.” 
This is the second year CPF has hosted fellows. Former fellows from Spring 2019 include Symone Sanders, a senior advisor for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign and CNN commentator; Mike Madrid, who serves as the principal at Grassroots Lab, a premier campaign management and lobbying firm located in California; and Doug Schoen, an influential Democratic campaign consultant who worked for Bill Clinton, Michael Bloomberg and several U.S. senators and governors.
“[The fellows program] supplements the coursework that students can do at USC by bringing them into contact with people in the real world of politics who have played a role as activists, strategists, journalists [and] pollsters,” Shrum said.
With the 2020 election just around the corner and the primaries in a few months, CPF hopes to host a variety of educational programs for the USC community. At the Democratic Debate Watch on Sept. 12, Klenk and Christie will be joining the stage to give live analysis for students and faculty.

Less than a month after becoming the first MLS team to clinch a playoff berth, the Los Angeles Football Club suffered its first home loss this season when it was shut out 2-0 by Minnesota United this past Sunday. Although many fans were distraught by the defeat, I contend that LAFC will move forward from the loss to end the regular season strong, especially when injured forward Carlos Vela returns to lead the team.
MNUFC’s 20-year-old striker Mason Toye was the difference in ending LAFC’s 19-game winning streak at Banc of California Stadium. Toye scored 2 goals within four minutes in the first half, stunning a dominant LAFC team and its passionate crowd. Toye’s goals were pretty — the first a curved ball from a difficult angle inside the box and the second a powerful left-footed strike from 25 yards out.
With Toye’s impressive performance, the Los Angeles Football Club definitely missed having Vela, its captain and a Golden Boot favorite this season, on the pitch. With the final games of the regular season still left unplayed, Vela has already broken the record for most combined goals and assists in one MLS season. Vela is also in the running to break the single-season goal-scoring record, needing only 5 more scores to surpass Josef Martinez’s 31 goals for Atlanta United FC last season. In just two seasons in the MLS, Vela has already shattered the record for most MLS goals by a Mexican player. As he consistently proves himself to be a frontrunner for this season’s MVP Award, Vela’s value to LAFC as the team looks for its first championship is undeniable.
Last week, LAFC tied the crosstown rival Los Angeles Galaxy 3-3. While continuing the team’s winless streak this season against the Galaxy is disappointing enough, Vela also suffered a minor hamstring injury and left the game early in the second half. Vela’s importance is further underscored by the fact that his team lost the following game against MNUFC 2-0 in his absence.
Maintaining 77% of possession and 87% pass accuracy compared to MNUFC’s 57.2%, LAFC had control of last week’s game. However, MNUFC’s ability to capitalize on its opportunities to score rewarded them with the win. Compared to MNUFC’s four shots on target out of five total shots, LAFC’s eight shots on target out of 23 total shots shows a lack of precision in its attack. 
Sunday’s game would have benefited from Vela’s otherworldly offensive abilities. Vela creates space for his runs, misdirects defenders and generates goal-scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates out of thin air. The team couldn’t replace his sharpness and expertise as an attacker.
Going against the team with the best record in the league is daunting for anybody. For Minnesota United, seeing Vela’s name in the injury report calmed a lot of nerves and heightened its confidence to be able to win against a dominant LAFC team. Knowing that it did not have to put multiple men on a single attacker all game, MNUFC stepped onto the pitch with more composure. 
Despite having other talented players on the team, such as forwards Adama Diomande and Diego Rossi and midfielders Lee Nguyen and Eduard Atuesta, not having Vela on the pitch must have impacted the mindset of other LAFC players as well. Without a player that has consistently shown his value to the team and frequently scored game-winning goals, it seemed as though the pressure negatively impacted the team’s poise. LAFC’s nerves were reflected in a sloppy attack, as evidenced by the lack of shots on goal.
Like all team sports, the quality of a soccer team does not rely on one player. While Vela’s leadership and spectacular abilities on the field are definitely worth the recognition they receive, LAFC’s dominant season has not only been due to the striker’s record breaking season. Without Tyler Miller in goal, the young and talented Eduard Atuesta in the midfield, Diego Rossi’s attacking prowess, and other talented players on the LAFC roster, the club would not be in the position it is now as the likely winner of the Supporters’ Shield and favorites for the MLS Cup.
Vela should be returning to the pitch within the next few weeks. However, this loss makes it apparent that LAFC — while impressive all season long — is not invincible with or without Vela. As the regular season comes to a close and the playoffs begin, the road toward an MLS Cup will not be a smooth one.
Nonetheless, with its talented players, winning record and passionate supporters, the dreams of LAFC bringing a championship to Los Angeles are not so far-fetched.

Following a hard-fought win last weekend, featuring a devastating injury to quarterback JT Daniels and lapses on both sides of the ball, the Trojans seem laser-focused as they head into Saturday’s home contest against No. 23 Stanford.
USC’s defense made several elementary mistakes against Fresno State. Senior quarterback Jorge Reyna was able to scramble for 56 yards, go 2 of 2 on fourth down and complete two touchdown passes for Fresno State.
“We had some missed opportunities,” sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga said of the defense. “But the coaches are trying to get us back into position. For us, our ultimate goal is to win games, and so we’ve got to come back next week and do it.”
Winning against Stanford may be a tall order for this young defense, however.
The unit had several holes in the secondary last weekend, and the Stanford offense will not be as forgiving as Fresno State’s. Senior quarterback K.J. Costello completed 80% of his passes last week against Northwestern, posting 152 yards and one touchdown.
“K.J. [Costello]’s stats are incredible,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “He commanded that offense. [Stanford head coach David] Shaw gives him a lot of latitude within it, so he has a lot more experience in game-type situations.”
Experience is exactly what USC’s defense lacks. The young squad, however well-trained and efficient it appears in practice, has not yet taken enough live reps to expect the unexpected. The players and coaches will need to quickly assess Stanford’s strategy in order to prevent the seasoned Costello from making big plays.
“We need to be assignment-perfect and pay attention to detail,” Hufanga said. “If they say 10 yards, it’s 10 yards, not 12. We just need to be on our spot and do our thing.”
This includes exerting pressure on the quarterback. USC’s passive defense allowed Reyna too much time to adjust his strategy and scramble when no one was open. The team only had three sacks last week, when Pendergast and head coach Clay Helton agreed that it could have added four or five more.
Pressure on the quarterback may make the difference between a win and a loss this Saturday. 
“We’ve got to try to get in there and be physical, be nasty,” Hufanga said. “[Stanford] is a big, physical team, but they can also bring speed whenever they want.”
The Trojans will also need to prepare for the possibility of facing junior quarterback Davis Mills, Stanford’s second-stringer. Costello is currently undergoing concussion protocol, and the decision of whether he can play this weekend will not be released until Friday. His official status is questionable.
Mills’ presence in the game could present a blessing or a curse for the Trojans. 
On one hand, he does not have nearly the level of experience of Costello, having only ever played in one college game. On the other hand, USC has hardly any information on Mills and may not be able to adjust to his playing style.
“[Stanford has] very much a pro-style offense, which we’re not used to playing,” Pendergast said. “The biggest challenge we have is not only the personnel matchups and the formations, but just getting a feel for how they execute their plays.”
Despite the apparent obstacles ahead this weekend, the Trojans remain confident in their ability to contain Stanford. Several defensive players expressed their excitement to take on such a formidable Pac-12 opponent.
“I’m looking forward to getting my first pick this week,” sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin said. “I have goals set that I’m just hoping I can accomplish.” 
Griffin and the Trojans will take on Stanford at the Coliseum 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

Among the students from the Class of 2023, a Harvard freshman was met with a less invigorating fate in starting his college career. Ismail B. Ajjawi, an international student and the son of Palestinian refugees from Trye, Lebanon, was notified that he was denied entry into the United States and his student visa had been revoked. The decision was reached by U.S. Customs and Border Protection upon Ajjawi’s arrival at the Logan International Airport in Boston, Mass. after airport officials seized his laptop and cell phone. The officials reported that they found information that was critical of the U.S. that had been posted to social media by friends of Ajjawi.
The deportation of this 17-year-old college freshman came as a shock to many. However, others may be less surprised considering the drastic measures of immigration reform enacted by the Trump Administration. But after the ensuing uproar in response to his deportation, Ajjawi was able to return to the United States, clear customs and make it to Harvard’s campus just in time for the semester. Regardless, this was something Ajjawi shouldn’t have even gone through in the first place.
Another incident of deportation of a college student occurred in April 2018. Wenliang Sun, a student from China attending the University of Central Florida, was deported after police found he possessed a semi-automatic weapon. Additionally, Sun reportedly was not attending his classes, which is a violation of most — if not all — of the requirements set by student visas.
Their deportation is jarring to say the least. Since it’s a student studying internationally, with a visa that allows them to do so, this opens a whole new and daunting door to the true motives of the Trump Administration’s immigration reform. At USC, which boasts one of the largest international student populations of any university in the U.S., the administration must take proper measures to ensure the safety of our international student community.
USC must take a stance and implement regulations that ensure the welfare of its students studying here from across the globe, regardless of their visa status. As we can see with Ajjawi’s case, there is a gray area when it comes to understanding the grounds for revoking a student visa. According to the Office of International Services, as long as a student maintains their status as a full-time student, there should be no issue with their visa. This, of course, comes with the understanding and assumption that the student is following university policy in every area.
It’s safe to assume that other universities, including Harvard, have student visa regulations similar to those of USC. The issue here is not within the grounds of university policy but rather that of a nationalist administration that has taken over the U.S. government. 
So how else can USC ensure its protection of international students under the Trump Administration’s harsh and ambiguous immigration policies? What was once a dangerous sentiment of massive deportation preached to the masses is now taking a toll on those who are studying abroad in the U.S. 
To start, USC can increase its resources for those on a student visa for their peace of mind. A simple yet direct forum that promotes USC’s dedication to protecting its students under this radicalized administration would not only set a precedent, but assure current and potential students that USC is on their side — no matter what the government’s administration has in store. In addition, the resources available for international students that feel threatened by the Trump Administration are lacking and overdue. Currently, there are no resources provided by USC for international students regarding ways to address unfair treatment caused by their international student status.
However, it goes without saying that the U.S. government has the most jurisdiction when it comes to who can and cannot stay in the U.S. With that said, USC is a colossal university with vast connections to government officials and other powerful people. It must use its influential standing and force to use Ajjawi’s experience to develop and provide more resources for all international students, not only for the sake of USC’s international student community but for the sake of all that wish to — and do — study abroad in the U.S.
The entire premise of an institution — whether it be a high school or university — is to safeguard their students from the harsh realities of the real world. This is not to say that laws don’t apply, because they do, but rather that there is opportunity for mistakes to be made and lessons to be learned from those mistakes. That includes impending forces that aim to inflict seemingly arbitrary punishment on innocent students. No matter how monopolizing and large those forces may seem, USC must stand up against that injustice and ensure the well-being of all of its students.

Growing up, most kids try everything they can to look older. Even if it’s something as simple as wearing “big kid” clothing to try to appear taller in order to ride a roller coaster at Six Flags, the younger generation wants to be perceived as more mature. Though nearly everyone will grow out of this somewhat irritating stage of life and eventually be treated like adults, younger looking Asians like me aren’t usually so lucky. 
I’m not sure if I was handed the worst genes in the pool, but it honestly seems like I fell into the fountain of youth when I was a kid. I’ve been in almost every “little-kid” scenario; from being told I looked two grades below my own in elementary school to my most recent debacle of getting my ID checked at an R-rated movie. And even though it has gotten to the point where my friends and I joke about it, the underlying fact is that it’s important to remind others to not enforce such stereotypes that essentially judge someone based on appearance.
Among the now countless episodes, I vividly recall a demeaning event that still haunts my thoughts to this day. My family was flying home from summer vacation on the East Coast, and we were given seats in the exit row of the plane. Unlike every other seat, exit rows require passengers to be able to assist the flight crew in the case of an emergency and have a designated age restriction of 15 or older. As the flight attendant was quickly assessing everyone’s ability, she stumbled upon me and asked to confirm I was 15. Her face swiftly became aghast that I told her I was three years over her estimate. To say the least, I made sure to choose any other seat other than the exit row for the next few flights to avoid the chance of any age confrontations.
Before continuing this point, it’s important to first acknowledge that my thoughts on this issue aren’t rooted in remaining selfishly agitated toward those who guessed my age incorrectly. Obviously, most of their remarks end up being light-hearted misconceptions and have usually resulted in a compliment telling me to feel lucky about my youthful features, and how much I will value this when I am older. I’m not trying to say I don’t appreciate these comments — what’s upsetting is the sheer obliviousness and the blatant disregard for the impact of assuming someone is younger simply based on their appearance.
A recent occurrence that underlines this tone happened to me this summer at the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. After finding out we could get a tour of the facility from a relative who worked in the building, my mom and I made our way over one morning. We were greeted in the lobby by ambassadors who told us that all adults need to sign in. The woman only offered my mom the form. When I revealed to the worker that I was 19, she quickly remarked that I looked “so young” and had a surprised expression as if I was exposing one of my biggest secrets to her.
While stories like this may be humiliating, these “misjudgers” are not intentionally meaning to inflict any harm. The ambassador’s remark was likely a genuine reaction. And even though it still hit a sour note, no actions were purposely taken to demean and put me down. And there was no age minimum for the tour, unlike the plane exit seat.
However, my most recent experience at my local DMV showcased a perfect example of blatant disregard toward age. With the new domestic air travel restrictions for driver’s licenses, I decided to try and obtain an updated “REAL ID” version before mine expired in a few months. The appointment went smoothly and right as I thought every employee I met was going to treat me professionally, I arrived at the photo desk with the loudest greeting of “kiddo” I had ever received. This was more belittling than the hundreds of times I’ve been called “buddy” by waiters. As we went through the final steps of the appointment, he asked some general questions, and I was able to reveal I was a sophomore, which he, without a doubt thought meant I was in high school.
In the end, I’m not trying to say I don’t understand where these people’s assumptions are coming from. I clearly look young, and I have for my entire life. My problem arises from a genuine discomfort based on the lack of awareness people exhibit when first meeting me. Looking youthful can definitely be both a blessing and a curse. And maybe if I wasn’t Asian I’d be able to grow a beard, and then people would recognize my age.

Trojan Football season is here —  and with that comes the weekly ritual of tailgating with friends and fellow Trojans. While beer might be the drink of choice for many on game day, wine can be a better alternative for those who want to spice things up just a bit. 
Burgers and hot dogs are the main staples of any tailgate experience and they can largely dictate which wines you should drink in the moment. The key to understanding which to pair with food is being aware of the condiments and toppings. These little choices will take wine drinkers on a journey with their wine — hopefully one you’ll enjoy if you keep these few notes in mind.
Note No. 1: If you’re addicted to pickles and ketchup, you’ll want to choose a refreshing wine to even out that heavy vinegar. A wine like 2018 Quinta da Lixa Loureiro ($10) from Vinho Verde, Portugal with its rosy, citrusy taste is the way to go. It’s as casual as you want your tailgate to be.
Note No. 2: If you’re feeling a bit fancy, such as with a burger or hot dog topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese, an overly fruity wine will help add balance. A Radius Cabernet ($11) from Columbia Valley, WA, is the perfect match. This delicious Cabernet will remind you of the homemade jams your grandmother made for you with its aroma of red fruits and black cherries. It’s a sure crowd-pleaser with a surprising finish, so be sure to bring an extra bottle to share with friends.
Note No. 3: Wine-drunk is preferred if you’re planning on actually watching the game. The term “beer belly” exists for a reason — beer can make you bloated. If you’re like me, and going to the game means taking hundreds of photos for Instagram, then you definitely don’t want to look bloated in your gameday outfit. Maybe a bit of wine could assist you in making small talk so it seems like you actually understand the game, because I sure don’t.
Note No. 4: This is perhaps the most important note. Wine is for every occasion. It’s never too pretentious or snobby to drink wine, even if it’s at a tailgate. For so long, wine has been unapproachable for most people, with names that most people cannot pronounce and the financial costs associated with it. But don’t let these factors stop you from enjoying wine. 
You don’t need to know how to pronounce it properly since it’s very likely most people around you won’t know either, and those who do are probably too drunk to care. There are plenty of wines like the ones mentioned that are both affordable and taste just as delicious as the expensive ones that are out of reach for college students.
Drinking wine and tailgating might seem like an odd pairing at first, but the possibilities are endless if you give the combination a chance. In the end, always remember that a red solo cup is a great equalizer and tailgates are meant to be fun, so don’t let anyone stop you from consuming the drink of your choice.

Spoiler Alert wants you to have fun at its shows. However, there will always be people having more fun than you — the performers themselves.
Remember when you thought that winging that speech for your communication class would be easy? You know how that turned out. Imagine being in a group whose goal it was to wing, well, everything. Enter Spoiler Alert, an improv group founded in 2011 whose goal is to spread joy at USC. 
Spoiler Alert performs a signature long-form/short-form hybrid style of improv, which comes in two forms: the episode, in which the group improvises a 45-minute episode of a fictional TV show created from audience suggestions of genre and title, with “commercial breaks” consisting of improv games, and a mono-scene, which is one 30-minute scene that takes place in the same room with the same characters. 
The goal in each of these approaches to long-form improv is not to be the funniest person in the room. Rather, it’s to share truths that the audience can relate to. 
“There’s this philosophical idea in comedy and in improv specifically that the funniest thing you can ever do in any moment is tell the truth,” Liam Clancy, the president of Spoiler Alert, said. “The audience likes to see their lives validated in some sense because they want to know that they’re not alone, and by showing that relationships can be weird and complicated. That’s funny enough. You don’t have to try to tell jokes.”
Potential new members enter auditions, which consist of a group of four to five auditioners playing an assigned improv game while the group watches, according to Clancy, a junior majoring in economics and neuroscience. They “steamroll,” a term in improv that means making the scene all about themselves. During last season’s auditions, the auditioners that remained silent but handled the steamrolling situation in a mature fashion were the ones that stood out to Clancy and were among the ones offered callbacks. 
“The other thing we really look for in auditions are people who are different than our troupe now,” Clancy said. “Everyone in our troupe is very different, from a very different background, has very different hobbies, and that’s part of what makes us good. You can only improvise on stuff that you know, so we all like to have a very broad knowledge base.”
Spoiler Alert rehearses twice a week for two hours at a time. This is the only shared trait among their rehearsals. 
“We’re always trying to vary it up, do something different, practice a different muscle, practice a different skill,” said Cameron Bennett, a Spoiler Alert member majoring in economics. 
Sometimes, the group does compassion meditation sessions during which each person brings up a question about improv and a prompt about their day, and each person responds to what the others have posed. It allows the members of Spoiler Alert to enter the headspace necessary to begin improvising and to release some of the baggage of their day.
What began as an extracurricular for the members of Spoiler Alert has slowly influenced their daily lives. For instance, an improv rule from the Upright Citizen’s Brigade — an improv and sketch comedy group founded in 1990 — of noticing the first unusual thing in a scene has allowed Clancy to become more attentive to the interesting and humorous occurrences constantly around him. 
Bennett believes that improv has allowed him to foster the skill of truly listening to the people around him.
“There’s this other concept in improv … ‘yes, and’ … at the core of it, it means, the only way you can continue to develop your scene and add onto it and improvise is if you’re 100% listening to what the other person is saying and accepting that as the truth of that scene and then adding onto it,” Bennett said. “Like never saying no to what someone else is bringing to the table, always taking that idea, and that’s incredibly useful just in life.”
While growing up, Spoiler Alert member Ruby Marker felt that her comedy was perceived as irritating by others due to her gender. However, being a member of Spoiler Alert has given her a community that appreciates her contributions.
“Being around people that give 100% of themselves to support you … has made me understand how much people can be there for me and how I can feel free to be weird and myself,” said Marker, a freshman majoring in theatre. “I found a lot more confidence.” 
Spoiler Alert performs every Tuesday night at 10 p.m. at Tommy’s Place. Auditions for the group will be held this Friday, Sept. 6 from 5 to 7 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m. and on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 1 to 3 p.m. outside of Taper Hall.

There’s no doubt that the Roski School of Art and Design is full of talented students, but few have a story like Alaskan native Natalie Treadwell, whose latest exhibit focuses on natural resource development and consumption in her home state of Alaska, specifically the production of oil. 
“These are places that we don’t see and that we don’t talk about,” Treadwell said of her exhibit titled “Crude.” “I’ve had to create a language through the art to talk about the reality of these places.” 
Treadwell’s work features oil paintings, adding squid and octopus ink to emphasize the benefit of natural materials. The exhibit, now located in the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery, displays paintings such as “The Trans-Alaska Pipeline” and “Refill” on large canvases. Treadwell says it took her over 30 hours to complete each piece.
“I wanted to have an honest conversation about our resource use and really be able to point to the areas that they’re coming from and talk about the misconceptions about developing these places,” Treadwell said. 
She explained that most people often misunderstand that the taking of natural resources does not always correlate with just environmental destruction — for Alaska, its directly linked to the state’s economy. 
Treadwell’s interest in art sparked when she dropped her Spanish major and decided to take a painting class at the University of Notre Dame. She eventually got invited to become one of the 12 Young Explorers on the Heart of the Arctic cruise. Already in love with her homeland, this trip furthered her interest in the North, its culture and the resources it provides for the rest of the planet. 
Now a senior at USC majoring in art and geographic information science and technology, Treadwell shares these intertwined passions with a greater audience.
“The reality is that we use these resources, [like oil], every single day all around the world, and it’s one of our main sources of economy in Alaska,” Treadwell said. “We have an incredible amount of land up there that’s not developed, but there are some pretty great places to get natural resources.” 
According to the Alaska Permanent Fund, Alaskans get repaid through tax returns for the resources taken from their state, which, Treadwell said, debunks the misconception that energy development is only beneficial for one specific corporation. Instead, the taking of Alaskan materials is advantageous for both Alaskans, the companies that produce the materials from nature and the rest of the world. 
With her art, Treadwell informs her audience of the positive acts natural resource development create for the environment that are often ignored. 
“I was really trying to make work that maybe in some ways glorifies [natural resource development], but also just shows it as it is,” Treadwell said. “Whoever comes and looks at it can make a decision about it based on how they feel.”
