When it comes to food, USC students appreciate two things — convenience and a good price. With food delivery apps like Tapingo, GrubHub and Postmates, getting “fast” food delivered to their doorstep has never been easier. Yet for Trojans who are gluten-free, getting a quick bite to eat is not so easy.
Los Angeles is famous for its health-consciousness and trendy food culture, and like the many food fads before it, the “gluten-free” lifestyle has found its place here. But “gluten-free” isn’t just another Hollywood A-lister’s new swanky diet.
Today, 1 in 333 Americans have celiac disease, a statistic that is growing as diagnostic methods improve. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that is activated by gluten consumption. The best treatment for celiac disease is living gluten-free, which can get even harder in college. Luckily, L.A. offers many gluten free delivery options, to make life a little easier for the gluten-intolerant. Here are a few that are both reasonably priced and convenient:
After taking two midterms in one day last week, the only thing I wanted was a good nap and pizza. California Pizza Kitchen at TCC, my go to stop, however, does not offer gluten-free options at its location at USC. Lucifers Pizza offers a similar selection of pizzas and price range (of around $8 for a personal pizza), with the added bonus of being gluten-free. They deliver to campus and stay open until 11 p.m.
The Amazebowls truck, which is often parked near the finger fountain, offers acai bowls and smoothies that are gluten-free. Amazebowls is the perfect post-midterm pick-me-up for days when you want something light but sweet. And, with the no-delivery-charge promotion on Tapingo delivery app, the total cost of an Amazebowl order is around $5.
If you’re looking to mix things up, check out Azla Ethiopian, located off Grand Avenue.  With a gluten-free kitchen, everything Azla serves is up for grabs, including spicy Ethiopian curry. Add a side of flatbread and order with a friend and you will easily meet the $20 delivery minimum.
While living gluten-free requires research and planning ahead, the gluten-free options near campus are not confined to just the dining halls. Getting gluten-free food can be easy and affordable if you find for the right place and take advantage of food delivery apps!

There are a lot of alternative music genres out there that are waiting to be explored. One of my favorites is bossa nova, a type of Brazilian samba and jazz mix. You can hear its roots in percussion and intricate, unorthodox rhythms, the backbone to any song.
Bossa nova is sunshine music through and through, and in the sunny state of California, there’s plenty of inspiration to listen to it. It’s nearly impossible not to be in a good mood when it’s playing. The key to this genre is flow; there are hardly ever any breaks in the songs. Everything happens in a smooth order, and any bossa nova song will have you nodding your head or tapping your foot from start to finish without any interruptions. The percussion section is in control of your sense of rhythm while the song plays. Despite there being odd accents in the rhythm from the percussion, it always resolves perfectly to keep you on beat.  
Bossa nova is good party music, but it’s also perfect to take a siesta to. The more up-tempo songs are guaranteed to move some feet and put smiles on a lot of faces. The slower songs are great to relax to, or good background music for a small get-together. Whatever your preference, this music is uplifting and good clean fun. The go-to artist when it comes to this genre is the saxophonist Stan Getz, who keeps songs flowing with his smooth playing. There’s a quality to his playing that has a distinct sound of familiarity, even if you’ve never heard any of his songs before.
My first experience with bossa nova was with the song “The Girl From Ipanema,” which features Stan Getz. The music is by Antônio Carlos Jobim while the Portuguese lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes. It has a haunting and melancholy message that comes through with the saxophone solo. Since then, I’ve been hooked, finding new songs to this day to add to my collection. The genre isn’t as well known as it should be, but I haven’t met anyone yet who doesn’t like it, so listen up!
