With the goals of spurring innovation and bringing bioscience research into the 21st century, Research 2.0, an academic research reform initiative from the School of Pharmacy, has launched “March Metrics,” the first open-source competition that will recognize the country’s most impactful, productive researchers.
Created as a spin-off of NCAA basketball’s March Madness for the bioscience world, the competition, which is being held until March 31, will utilize a series of traditional and digital metrics to provide a holistic picture of bioscience research.

This competition aims to promote and stimulate worldwide research and help the bioscience industry adopt 21st century tools, such as digital media and improving technological processes.
“This is a huge area that no university in the world is fundamentally looking at,” said Research 2.0 Creator Llewellyn Cox, a program administrator for research at the School of Pharmacy. “This initiative will look at things like, ‘How do we share data better? How do we leverage the power of the Internet to do things faster, more efficiently and, frankly, better?’”
March Metrics builds on the Pharmacy School’s Research 2.0 initiative, which strives to connect entrepreneurs and startups in the bioscience industry, with the academic community to foster innovation by sharing ideas, research and tools.
Cox and his team decided to develop “March Metrics” as a contest because they believe the power of competition can  encourage important and needed changes.
“It’s a fundamental belief of mine that competition spurs people to that next level of innovating, of pushing themselves,” Cox said. “At USC, we want to be putting out students who are recognized as being world-class research scientists. By giving them this sense of competition, they will be better prepared for the ‘real world,’ where all of a sudden they will be in a very competitive atmosphere.”
Harshkumar Sancheti, a doctoral student in molecular pharmacology and toxicology program at the School of Pharmacy, expressed enthusiasm for the program’s potential.
“[March Metrics] will act as a good incentive,” said Sanchetti, who will be submitting a project that investigates treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. “It will stimulate healthy competition among students.”
Research projects will be evaluated and scored on three types of metrics: research communication, data generation and research funding. The projects will receive scores based on factors like where they are published and the level of outreach done on Facebook and Twitter. The school will determine the winners from a pool of competitors around the country that include graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and faculty members. Winners will get more recognition for when the March Metrics website posts their raw data and material online.
“The academic research landscape … operates in an insular, patent, self-selecting environment,” Cox said. “But, there is a huge hope for citizen-science and small startups to reform academia to become a hub for diverse research.”
A significant component of the project — and one that Cox said holds the key to connecting the academic community with entrepreneurs and other outside innovators — is social media.
“Social media gives you the opportunity to engage on an ongoing basis, and I think that is what really solidifies communities,” Cox said. “Sharing the pitfalls, back steps and really finding an answer. This is something we have lost in science on a national effort. But this is what [bioscience] is all about — finding an answer.”
Martha Pastuszka, a fourth-year graduate student also in the molecular pharmacology and toxicology program, said March Metrics’ use of social media has successfully allowed research to be accessible in various formats.
“It makes it much more exciting than just publishing in a paper and then waiting a couple of months down the line to see if someone cited your paper or not,” Pastuszka said. “You can potentially track whether people are reading your stuff or not and what kind of impact your research has on greater scientific communication.”
Pastuszka said her involvement in the project has introduced her to research on social media.
“When I started March Metrics, I opened up a Twitter account, and now I’m following other scientists on Twitter,” Pastuszka said. “Not only are they able to see my research, but I am also being exposed to different research that is out there.”
Cox said the industry finds itself facing new challenges, such as economic and funding issues, making it imperative for the industry to move forward. Cox said the project seizes a huge opportunity to revolutionize the industry through innovation, communication and entrepreneurship.
“We need to find new ways of doing things,” Cox said. “We can either accept that we are in a losing situation and shrink  or we can be leaders.”
Cox said USC is in the perfect position to make an impact because it is equipped with cutting-edge tools and the top minds that can use the information garnered from this competition to the benefit of the bioscience industry as a whole.
“This project will give us a broad view of how research is conducted and communicated on a worldwide level,” Cox said. “From this, we can draw inferences into how we can do things better.”
Cox noted the potential for the program to grow beyond USC.
“If this competition becomes popular outside USC also, then I think it will serve a very important goal of making researchers think about sharing their research through the enormous sources available,” Cox said.
Cox said there are numerous advantages to using an open-source approach to this project.
“The advantage of putting data out there is that it can provide a multiplier effect of how much data we can get back that has been analyzed and looked at,” Cox said. “It gives us leverage moving forward.”
Cox said this initiative is more than just a competition. It is also a research project that will seek to collect and analyze a multitude of data with the goal of improving bioscience processes.
“Collecting this data will hopefully help us for years to come,” Cox said.

The mayoral primary election on March 5 experienced one of the lowest voter turnouts in Los Angeles’ electoral history, with 21 percent of registered Angelenos showing up to the polls on election day as of March 9, according to the New York Times.
Despite the more than $19 million spent by the mayoral candidates seeking to succeed Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in the primary election, barely more than one-fifth of the 1.8 million registered LA voters voted in the election. This figure, according to records kept by the Los Angeles City Clerk, suggests the lowest turnout in a primary with no incumbent in more than 30 years.
An interactive online map by the Los Angeles Times indicates that only 170 people voted between the two polling places on the University Park  Campus.
Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur attributed the low voter turnout to November’s presidential and congressional races.
“This is one of the inevitable downsides of having an odd-year election,” Schnur said.
Asher Levy, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said the recent national election could have led to a sense of “voter fatigue” in some citizens.
“We just had a presidential election that really zapped everyone’s interest,” Levy noted.
Such speculation has led many to call for an alignment of city races with national and statewide elections.
“Cities that match local campaigns with larger elections invariably see much higher turnout,” Schnur said. “Of course, the opposition to coinciding local with national races is that mayoral candidates will receive less attention.”
USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy said tying the importance of the mayor’s race to races for governor or president could encourage increased participation in municipal politics, which often play a more immediate and visible role in the lives of citizens.
“Local elections, in many ways, impact quality of life way more than a presidential or congressional race,” Taxy said. “From traffic to potholes to law enforcement, local politics have direct implications for everyday life and USC students should feel a stake in this election.”
Taxy, who registered to vote in Los Angeles instead of his hometown of Oakland, said he feels obliged to participate in the politics that govern issues he faces daily as a resident of the city. Both not everyone is so motivated, and USC College Republicans President Madeline Lansky said the challenge for the remaining mayoral contenders in the next 10 weeks will be to encourage Angelenos to show up and vote — an effort relies on making sure people are informed.
“I did a lot of calling the week before the election, and half the people I talked to didn’t even know there was a primary on Tuesday,” Lansky said. “The other half didn’t know who the candidates were.”
Schnur noted that both Eric Garcetti and Wendy Greuel would have to do their part, including differentiating themselves as candidates and rallying voter involvement, to make sure voters show up on election day.
“There’s a sense that Garcetti and Greuel may have played things safe in order to avoid any problems that could have cost them the top two positions,” Schnur said. “In the runoff, your goal isn’t simply to not lose, it’s to win. They’re going to do all they can to make sure that their bases show up on election day and vote.”
The two candidates are keenly aware of this, and Greuel said the lack of voter turnout reflects Angeleno’s disillusionment with city politics.
“This shows that people are frustrated,” Greuel told the New York Times. “Part of running [for office] is to try to change that.”
Garcetti also emphasized the importance of promoting a sense of civic engagement.
“We don’t have as deep of a sense of civic culture as we do in other cities, which is part of the reason I wanted to run,” Garcetti told the New York Times.

Former California Gov. George Deukmejian spoke to students and faculty on Monday about the importance of perseverance in the face of failure.
Persistent politician · Former California Gov. George Deukmejian talked to students on Monday about how perseverance leads to success. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
During his speech, titled “If I Could Do It, You Can Do It,” Deukmejian recounted to a crowd in the Social Sciences Building about  how the support of his family attributed to his successes.
“I don’t have very much to tell you about myself that is extraordinary or different,” Deukmejian said. “I was very fortunate to have wonderful support from my parents.”
Deukmejian described his journey from a New York State town with 1,700 residents to his time in law school, where Deukmejian was approached by a sergeant who presented a life-changing opportunity to him: the sergeant asked him for legal help.
“I went to this sergeant who I had helped and asked if I could get my Military Occupational Specialties number and change my classification from an infantryman because of my law degree,” Deukmejian said.
Because of this interaction, Deukmejian did not have to fight in the military and continued with his political career. After moving to Long Beach in the 1950s, he became friends with a State Assemblyman William Grant through a Republican Party club. Deukmejian then volunteered to aid his campaign for reelection. When Grant retired, Deukmejian then ran for his seat and won. Deukmejian decided to run for attorney general. However, his bid was unsuccessful.
“I came in dead last among four candidates,” Deukmejian said. “But I still kept my seat in the State Senate, and ran again in 1978.”
Deukmejian won his race in 1978 and worked under then- (and current) Gov. Jerry Brown. When Brown vacated the governorship to make a bid to become one of California’s national senators from California, Deukmejian put his name on the primary ballot and won.
Deukmejian said he his proudest achievement was working with both sides of the aisle.
“I used the power of veto 4,000 times,” Deukmejian said. “I was the only Republican to hold a constitutionally mandated state office at the time — every other office was controlled by Democrats. They had the majority in both houses of the state assembly.”
Janet Shamilian, a senior majoring in political science, said it was not only Deukmejian’s successes that were inspiring, but his response to initial failure.
“I really like that he elaborated on both his successes and his unsuccessful campaigns,” Shamilian said. “It is always motivating to see someone who was unsuccessful the first time around.”
Arteen Mnayan, a senior majoring in political science, said Deukmejian is also a role model, especially for those also of Armenian heritage.
“Armenians have Deukmejian to look up to,” Mnayan said.  “It’s inspiring and it allows us to accomplish things we never thought we would.”
Deukmejian concluded the event by urging students to take an active part in civic engagement.
“I urge you to continue to work hard, to strive to do your best,” Deukmejian said. “Whatever you choose to do, you can always still have an interest in pubic life. You don’t necessarily have to be an elected person. You can vote.”

Coming off an uplifting victory over crosstown rival UCLA, the USC women’s tennis team faces a tough challenge with three matches in the next five days, starting with the Texas Longhorns at home on Tuesday.

The Women of Troy will also face off against two Pac-12 foes, Colorado and Utah, this weekend at Marks Stadium.
No. 12 USC (10-2, 1-0) had struggled through back-to-back matches, including a loss at rival Cal on Feb. 23, before a rousing win against the No. 3 Bruins in Westwood this past week.
Despite the match being interrupted by rain, the Women of Troy hung together and, even after losing the doubles’ point, strung together four victories in the singles side to come out on top.
“Once we got out onto the lights [after the delay], the kids were just on fire,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said. “The win was mainly possible because of the win last Friday, and I give the girls a lot of credit for sucking it up on that day and giving us a lot of momentum.”
Finally fully healthy after the return of sophomores Zoë Scandalis and Sabrina Santamaria, USC can boast its normal regular starting lineup, which has shown it can go toe-to-toe with the country’s best teams.
In their first bout this week, the Women of Troy return home to face off against a struggling Longhorns team that sits at a meager 3-6. Perennially a national contender, Texas has slumped badly this season, including a recent 0-7 sweep at the hands of No. 20 Stanford.
Still, Texas does boast the reigning Big 12 champion in junior Elizabeth Begley, though the decorated player has yet to hit her stride this season with a                  14-10 record. Senior Aeriel Ellis has taken the majority of the reps at the first singles slot and sports a decent 3-3 record there.
“If we fall asleep against Texas, we’re in big trouble,” Gallien said. “They are a talented team who have not hit their stride. We certainly better be ready. Hopefully we get a nice crowd out there and have a nice day.”
Following the match against Texas, USC will face the bottom rung of the Pac-12 conference in Colorado and Utah. Although no conference opponent should be taken lightly, Colorado is at an even .500 record (6-6), and Utah stands at 7-3, but neither has shown the ability to beat a quality opponent yet.
Junior Carla Manzi Tenorio has been the Buffaloes’ most consistent player and has been one of the few bright spots for Colorado.
After their match against Colorado, the Women of Troy will conclude the homestand against Utah. Junior Sarah Pham and sophomore Tereza Berekova, who will face off against USC’s top singles players, lead the Utes into their match at Marks Stadium.
The Women of Troy currently have two players in the nation’s   top-10 singles with Sabrina Santamaria and senior Danielle Lao sitting at No. 3 and No. 7, respectively.  Scandalis is ranked in the top 30 as she currently ranks at No. 26 in the country.
Freshman Ellie Yates earned a Pac-12 player of the week nomination for her outstanding play against San Diego and Cal, and the Women of Troy continue to display the great depth that they have.
With conference play starting to ramp up, it will be important for USC to capitalize on its easier opponents and gain momentum for the meat of the Pac-12 conference.

Let’s put it this way: If you notice athletes prominently featured on Deadspin on a Sunday, they probably aren’t featured for any philanthropic reasons. It isn’t because they visited a downtown Boys & Girls Club. And it isn’t because they hosted an anti-crime campaign insisting people should “shoot baskets, not guns,” or anything like that.
Setback · Interim head coach Bob Cantu’s job of preparing his team for the Pac-12 tournament was made more difficult after Sunday’s fracas. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
No, they’re making news because of Saturday-night shenanigans. And that’s exactly what happened last Sunday afternoon to the USC men’s basketball team.
Sports news outlet Deadspin, citing a local television station, pointed out eyewitness reports claiming two USC players were involved in an altercation in downtown Spokane, Wash., that sent four people to the hospital. Senior center James Blasczyk and redshirt junior center Dewayne Dedmon are alleged to be involved.
The Trojans had been in Eastern Washington after facing Washington State earlier in the day in the teams’ regular-season finale. They spent the night in Spokane before leaving on a flight Sunday.
On Monday, USC interim head coach Bob Cantu suspended Blasczyk and Dedmon indefinitely, citing a violation of a team rule. Officials acknowledge they are aware of the police investigation but declined to comment further until more information comes to light.
To be fair, neither player has been arrested at this point. Neither has been charged. The investigation is ongoing.
But the allegations remain absolutely serious. According to Noel Macapagal, an employee and former owner of The Wave Sushi Island Sports Grill and Sushi Bar — the reported location of the brawl, one person was “knocked out cold.” A female employee left with a broken nose. Another employee suffered a broken jaw.
That isn’t some little shouting match. This is a drunken melee at       2 a.m. The incident is not just serious, but pathetic and deplorable. How much either Blasczyk and Dedmon participated in the ordeal remains unknown, but the allegations alone are no doubt disturbing.
Whoever takes over as the Trojans’ next head coach in the next month or so evidently has quite a bit of housecleaning to do. Mind you, the on-court mediocrity is more than apparent; a 20-43 mark over the last two seasons sticks out like a sore thumb. But beyond that, the program’s culture appears to be in declining disarray.
The odd thing is Athletic Director Pat Haden has previously noted that the team’s players have kept their noses clean, using that example as a rationale for retaining former coach Kevin O’Neill at the end of last season.
But, in examining the past two years, it hardly seems that way.
In January 2011, former freshman guard Bryce Jones faced dismissal from the team after punching a teammate and getting into a confrontation with a resident advisor at a campus dormitory, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In March 2011, O’Neill was infamously involved in an altercation with an Arizona booster in the lobby of a Downtown Los Angeles hotel. Photos surfaced of him that caused some to speculate that he was drunk and holding an alcoholic beverage in his left hand.
During a February 2012 road trip in Arizona, junior forward Ari Stewart, a Wake Forest transfer, was arrested on a charge of possessing marijuana and drug paraphernalia.
Does the program need a babysitter?
Now, on the heels of a 25-point loss to Washington State, news hits that players were involved in a so-called “rolling fight” that resulted in a handful of people being rushed to an area hospital.
Losing, and losing in such embarrassing fashion, naturally looks bad for any team. But, hey, guess what looks worse? Punching people on the street after a defeat.
USC basketball has become a bit of a running joke on this campus, in this city and in this conference. Losing plays a part, of course. But, instances like these only add to the punch line. It’s hard to take a program seriously when its players and coaches are caught in bar fights or arrested.
Do the players and coaches still take the program seriously?
Cleaning house, if you will, never seemed more imperative. This program is a fixer-upper, to say the least. Anyone who has followed the team in recent years understands and recognizes that. Nonetheless, every day serves as a reminder of how deep the problems rest and how unintentionally comical the program currently is.
Good thing this bunch will soon be en route to Las Vegas for the conference tournament.

With the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoff picture beginning to take shape, the USC men’s volleyball team (4-11) found themselves on the outside looking in as they headed to Honolulu for a weekend doubleheader. With the pressure on, the Trojans were unable to rise to the occasion, dropping both games in five sets.

Hawai’i (7-12) entered the weekend with a situation similar to the Trojans. The Warriors, led by freshman Sinisa Zarkovic, has enjoyed limited success this season, which has been highlighted by their four-game losing streak entering their game against the Trojans. The Trojans had a chance to make up for their own disappointing season with a pair of games against their underachieving hosts. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
USC was hot at the start of Friday’s match thanks to a combined seven kills from junior opposite Tanner Jansen and sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers. Though they found themselves trailing 18-21 near the end of the first set, the Trojans went on a tear, winning nine of the next 13 points to win the set. They carried this momentum with them into the second set, taking an early lead and holding on to go up two sets to none.
But from there, it was all Warriors. Hawai’i rode a wave of aggressive serving and stellar passing to three consecutive set victories. And despite three match points in the fourth, the Trojans were unable to close out the match and were defeated 25-26, 21-25, 25-22, 26-24, 15-9.
“Everything was clicking for us offensively and defensively,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “We saw our game plan play out even better than it did in the Stanford match, but once we went to the fifth it was pretty hard to turn the tide back in our favor.”
Though disappointing, Friday’s match featured a number of positives for the team, including a match-high 20 kills from Jansen and a season-high of nine service aces for the team. From a statistical standpoint, this was a great match for the Trojans but, unfortunately, they fell victim to an even better night from the Warriors.
“Hats off to them — they played a great match,” Ferguson said. “It was one of the toughest losses since I’ve been here at USC, and I thought our guys played their tails off.”
Looking to avenge Friday’s loss, Jansen once again took control of the Trojans in the first set of Sunday’s rematch. His leadership on the court allowed USC to stay ahead of a confident opposing squad. Although the Warriors were able to make it close in the end, Jansen’s seventh kill of the first set, followed by a decisive ace, gave the Trojans the first set 25-20.
Unfortunately, for the second time in three days, USC’s lead was to be short-lived. The Warriors turned it on in the second set, taking advantage of USC’s attacking errors and jumping out to a comfortable lead and an easy 25-21 victory. USC’s errant hitting continued into the third set and Hawai’i was able to take the 2-1 advantage.
Despite the strong play from Hawai’i, USC refused to go down in the fourth set. Much like the Warriors in their previous meeting, the Trojans needed to win to stay alive. This time, it was sophomore outside hitter Joey Booth leading the attack, with seven kills in the set and giving the Trojans a 25-23 win to force a fifth set.
“The fourth set was proof to me why we recruited these kids,” Ferguson said. “After losing back-to-back five set matches, I think most people would’ve quit, but they played the best volleyball they’ve played all year.”
Despite this display of resilience, USC’s struggles resurfaced in the fifth set. Although they took an early lead, the Trojans hit a dismal .056 and were unable to hold on for the win. The Warriors won 13 of the last 18 points en route to a 15-9 win in the fifth set and their second match victory of the weekend.
USC’s woes were made worse with the loss of sophomore middle blocker Ben Lam, who went down on Sunday with an what Ferguson called a “serious” ankle injury. With only nine matches remaining, this will make USC’s hunt for the playoffs even more difficult.
The team’s next match will be played in the Lyon Center on Friday at 7 p.m. against the No. 2 UC Irvine Anteaters.

Two USC centers, senior James Blasczyk and junior Dewayne Dedmon, have been suspended indefinitely from all team activities for violating a team rule, USC interim head coach Bob Cantu announced Monday in a written statement.

The announcement came after local media outlet KREM.com reported that Spokane police were investigating a brawl in downtown Spokane, Wash., early Sunday morning that witnesses said might have involved USC basketball players.
Blasczyk and Dedmon are rumored to be the two USC players involved in the incident, which police responded to around 2 a.m. Sunday morning. USC has not confirmed any link between the incident in Spokane and the suspensions. It is not yet determined if other USC basketball players were present at the scene of the fight, which sent four people to the hospital. One person reportedly suffered a broken nose, while another sustained a broken jaw. The team was spending Saturday night in Spokane after losing 76-51 at Washington State that afternoon.
“Detectives are in the preliminary stages of their investigation and are still gathering facts and conducting witness interviews,” said Spokane police in a statement. The city’s police department also reported that two Spokane residents have been arrested in association with the weekend incidents, and that updates are not expected to be released Monday.
Cantu addressed the status of the incident in a statement today, saying, “Separately, we are aware of the Spokane investigation into an alleged incident involving those players and we are cooperating with the authorities to determine the facts. Until we learn all the facts, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”
The duration of the suspensions remains unknown, but Cantu insisted that both Blasczyk and Dedmon would not play on Wednesday in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.
“They will miss the first game for sure on Wednesday,” Cantu said.  “[Beyond Wednesday], possibly.  They’re suspended indefinitely, and anything could happen, for sure.”
The 7-foot Dedmon has started in 29 of USC’s 31 games this season, leading the Trojans with 7.0 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game. Dedmon is also averaging 6.7 points per game on 50 percent shooting, and had a season-high 18 points in the Trojans’ loss to Washington on Wednesday before being limited to four points on Saturday.
The 7-foot-1 Blasczyk has played in 21 games this year as USC’s third center. He was averaging 1.5 points and 1.2 rebounds in 7.0 minutes per game. The senior played four minutes against Washington State, missing two shots and picking up a foul.
“They understand. They were cooperative and they were great,” Cantu said. “We just had a great practice with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. It’s time to move forward and see what we can do about winning on Wednesday.”
USC practiced at the Galen Center on Monday and will be in Las Vegas on Tuesday before taking on Utah on Wednesday. USC defeated the Utes 76-59 in their only meeting this season, which turned out to be former head coach Kevin O’Neill’s final game before being fired.
With the pair unavailable for Wednesday, 7-foot-2 junior center Omar Oraby and 6-foot-6 senior forward Aaron Fuller are likely to receive the increase in minutes during the Pac-12 Tournament. Averaging just 5.3 minutes this season, 6-foot-9 senior forward Renaldo Woolridge could also see additional time to fill a potential lack of size Dedmon and Blasczyk’s absence.
“The luxury you have is that you can go small and you can play Renaldo or [junior forward] Ari Stewart at the four spot,” Cantu said. “All in all, with Omar, it’ll be a good opportunity for him to play more minutes.  The thing he has to do is not get into foul trouble early, and he’s got to keep his wind and not get tired.”
USC players were unavailable for comment after Monday’s practice, but Cantu was confident his team would remain focused in preparation for Wednesday’s game.
“The message is, ‘let’s move forward and let’s win.’ This is the game plan for Utah, this is what we need to do,” Cantu said. “I was actually very impressed with the enthusiasm we just had at practice.  Guys were very enthusiastic, very focused and looked like they’re ready to play.”

We’ve been waiting for it, craving it, praying for it and finally it’s so close that we can touch it: spring break. For one glorious week, USC students will get time off from studying, attending mundane classes and dealing with extracurriculars. For one week, we can forget about that stupid thing called “responsibility” and just … breathe.
The big problem, however, is that somewhere between the midterms, papers and general lack of sleep, most of us haven’t had time to think about what to bring on our little adventures. Folks, spring break is three days away — it’s time to lay down the law and get crackin’.
So whether you’re planning on partying in Cabo or exploring Europe (or even heading home for some much-needed family time), I’ll be breaking down the basics of what you need to pack in order for your vacation to be as relaxing as possible.
Headed to: balmy paradise
If you plan on playing into the college-student cliche of turning Florida or Mexico into your own personal playground, be sure you know what you’re getting into. And, please, for the sake of your friends and family: Stay safe.
Now that the obligatory safety message has been stated, let’s get to the dirty work.
Bathing suits. Yes, for some reason, someone decided that tight one-pieces in the ’40s weren’t quite sexy enough. So, basically the Devil decided to make bikinis the new thing.
It might sound ridiculous, and you might not believe me, but everyone has swimsuit insecurities. Even that chick with the six-pack still thinks that her chest looks flat in her string bikini.
Instead of shaking in your flip-flops, it’s time to embrace your beautiful body. If you don’t want to wear a two-piece, then don’t. It’s that simple. You should feel comfortable in what you’re wearing.
Look around you: There are plenty of adorable — and even sexy — one-pieces that’ll knock anyone’s socks off as well as keep you super comfortable and confident.
Vintage is in. So look to old photos of Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren to spark some inspiration. Stores such as Everything But Water and Victoria’s Secret have affordable, cute and long-lasting one-pieces that’ll have both the boys and your wallet hollering in excitement. If you’re larger chested: Congratulations. But don’t forget that the girls can easily droop. Try to gravitate toward a smaller size so that you get the support that you need.
Whatever you do, please try to stay away from those tacky leopard prints and blinged-out suits. And guys: Ed Hardy is not a real designer. Stay away.
Headed to: The Cold War
Finding yourself skiing at Big Bear? Cavorting around Europe? Well, you’re in for a surprise. Turns out not everywhere in the world has beautiful 75 degree weather. Make sure to bring a nice coat that’ll work during the day and at night, and can be layered over sweaters easily.
Though coats come in a variety of colors and patterns, the most important thing to keep in mind is fit. Coats should never be so big that you’re swimming in it, or so small that you can barely bend your arms. Girls often forget the importance of a cinched-in waist to reveal your shape. And guys usually just gravitate towards the puffy down jackets of our middle school youth. It’s time to grow up, everyone: Invest in a coat that is comfortable, makes you look great and that you’ll keep forever.
Big spenders: Head over to Burberry to get a classic trench that you’ll always love. For those less inclined to drop 800 bucks on a beautifully cut piece of fabric, look for a coat that still aims to flatter. Neutral colors will make the coat last. Remember: Trends come and go, but a classic is forever.
And don’t forget to pack a few scarves and a pair of gloves. People often underestimate how cold the world can get. Don’t think that just because you’ll be skiing or snowboarding or taking long tours of the Sistine Chapel that you’ll sweat the cold away. We’ve been in Los Angeles for months now and are too used to beautiful weather. Mother Nature is a b-tch, so get used to it.
Headed to: Home Sweet Home
If you’re headed home, you’re in luck. You need to pack absolutely nothing. Just bring home a bag of laundry to throw at your parents.

New artist Jarell Perry is many things — a coffee and whiskey connoisseur, a UCLA alumnus and an exceedingly talents vocalist. But what really makes him stand out in the music world is his uncontainable passion, which jumps out at you when he speaks.
Stand for change · Jarell Perry writes autobiographical songs about his life, relationships and work, but says he hopes the words resonate with everyone. He wants people to know life goes beyond the polished fairy tale. – Courtesy of Pitchblend PR
 
He is a musician on a mission to create honest, soulful R&B, and his upcoming self-released EP, Simple Things, does just that.
Perry says his EP, set to drop on March 18, is intended to make listeners feel like they are embarking on an adventure.
“Simple Things is a journey. Every song has a moment for your life — a soundtrack to your life,” Perry said.
Though the lyrics were inspired by his own life and experiences, Perry said he hopes everyone can relate to the emotion he feels in his songs.
“I make songs for people to feel something — that’s the first thing. But, I also want to put a message that brings people some hope or to make them feel like they can be understood,” Perry said. “My songs don’t tell a certain story. They paint a picture, and that picture can be interpreted in many ways. That’s how I want people to look at the songs.”
The emotion, passion and drive communicated through his self-written ballad “All Aboard” is a perfect example of this.
“When you’re going for a dream, or something in life, not everyone can go with you, and not everyone’s going to understand where you’re going, or agree with where you’re going but you have to do what’s right for you,” Perry said.
To capture the emotion of his lyrics on Simple Things, Perry incorporates a host of acoustic sounds, electronic vibes and even some dubstep breaks. Perry said he wanted his listeners to get an element of surprise — a lot of “unexpected things.”
Though he has been dubbed a R&B/pop-fusion vocalist, he said he works to break this label and try to change his style every day.
“As an artist, I’ve always wanted to blend and not put a box on the genres,” Perry said.
Music has been a constant in Perry’s life from an early age. From gospel choir in high school to jam sessions and open mic nights with friends during his time at UCLA, he has continued to experiment and find his voice in the music world. His latest album, with its raw and soulful tracks, touches on all aspects of his life.
“It’s an honest record. … I talk about working, dreaming, wanting to be something, relationships, conflict — and those are really the simple things in life that I wanted to talk about because, at the end of the day, we’re all just real people,” Perry said. “Life goes beyond the polished fairy tale and the glammed-up music videos.”
Perry got his start creating material for other singers and rappers, but he decided to refocus and seek his own sound.
“It wasn’t fulfilling me like I wanted it to be, just chasing placements, record labels [and] different sounds,” Perry said.
This, Perry said, is why he is so careful with his image and how it is cultivated. Perry has put in countless days and nights to sculpt a creative name and brand for himself. Not only does he write his own music and lyrics, but Perry also works in the studio every night with his producer, Hassan Johnson, doing everything from designing the album art to his own website.
Perry said he would like Simple Things to serve as his introduction to the music world as a fresh and honest artist. People can count on Perry to come through with fresh vibes, relatable lyrics and a genuine personality. He’s an artist that has the chops to make you feel something through his lyrics and music.

You don’t need to be a fan of electronic dance music to have heard of Electric Daisy Carnival, the largest dance music festival in the United States, or the upcoming Beyond Wonderland Festival on March 16 at the San Manuel Ampitheater & Ground.
Panoramic sound · Beyond Wonderland is moving to a new venue, the San Manuel Ampitheater, this year. Unlike the past venue, the NOS Event Center, the ampitheater has fewer sound restrictions, allowing the sound systems to face all directions. Pasquale Rotella said that the change of venue will also create a new, fresh environment and atmosphere. – Courtesy of Insomniac/Rukes.com
 
A name many might not be as familiar with, however, is Insomniac Events. The event-planning production team, founded by Pasquale Rotella in 1993, is the driving force behind the success of Beyond Wonderland, EDC and several other annual music festivals throughout the year.
By creating large-scale, high-attendance dance music festivals (this year’s Beyond Wonderland is expecting 45,000 festival goers), Rotella has effectively helped expand a previously underground rave culture into the mainstream, supporting a scene that touches millions of people around the world.
“There was something cool about underground culture, but then separately dance culture … both [are] very exciting to me, [I] love both of those things,” Rotella said. “It is something special — it changed my life. I committed my entire life to it.”
Insomniac Events has allowed him to link these two cultures together, contributing to a movement some now see as this generation’s rock and roll.
It is not hard to see how Insomniac Events has become so successful. One only needs to look at Beyond Wonderland’s tagline, which follows its impressive list of performers, to understand.
Following artist names such as Afrojack, R3hab, Steve Angello, Dash Berlin and David Guetta, the tagline reads, “[And] the most important headliner of all — you — and the good vibes and energy that you create.”
Many Insomniac Events feature variations of this tagline. The message is clear and strong: Engaged fans are key to a successful music festival. In Rotella’s opinion, “the most important part of an Insomniac Event is the fans [who bring] the energy and excitement.”
The upcoming Beyond Wonderland, celebrating its fourth year, is a tribute to the success of Rotella’s vision. The festival, which sold out last year, seems poised to have just as much success this year. It boasts a lineup including several talented artists of various EDM subgenres including trance, house, trap and drum and bass.
“We’ve been working on the show all year long,” Rotella said. “We have to deal with the fire department, the police department, the booking of DJs, the stage production, the lighting, the lasers [and] the theatrical performers.”
Beyond Wonderland is moving to a new venue this year: the San Manuel Ampitheater in San Bernardino, Calif. Previous Beyond Wonderlands have been held at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino. Rotella said that the San Manuel Amphitheater has a distinct advantage over the NOS Center in that it has fewer sound restrictions because of the location.
“[Now we’ll be] able to have sound systems in directions where there aren’t any homes,” Rotella said.
He added that the change in venue will also provide a change of atmosphere and environment, creating an entirely fresh feel for this year’s show.
As Kevin Kerslake, director of the Electric Daisy Carnival Experience film, said, “One of the things that’s always impressed [me] about this particular culture is that there’s a lot of love and warmth and you don’t find that in other festivals, or even in other cultures, at large.”
For those new to dance music events, Beyond Wonderland will be an eye-opening experience, with hours of intense music, incredibly inventive light shows and imaginative costumes. But beyond the costumes and even the music, people going to Beyond Wonderland can expect a night full of good vibes, culture and love. As Rotella points out, Wonderland is more than just a music event — it’s about letting it all in and embracing the thousands of people around you.
Who knows? Perhaps the experience will be as life-changing for you as it was for Rotella.

In an effort to increase transparency and reinforce its commitment to consumers, high-end grocery store Whole Foods announced Friday that it would be mandating labels for genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in food products by 2018.
The decision was seen by some as an effort to reintroduce Whole Foods as one of the quality produce distributors in the United States. According to the company, by offering its consumer base an honest appraisal of its products, the higher costs of Whole Foods products can be justified.
Though this approach might seem unorthodox and risky, Whole Foods is making a wise decision in implementing a new strategy of transparency. By committing itself to being a “quality” grocery store, it is opening itself up to a consumer base with higher incomes that will ultimately help its brand.
The trend toward increasing transparency for consumers has recently seen an incredible upsurge with the rise of social media, and Whole Foods is making the correct choice to spark profits with that change.
“We’re responding to our customers, who have consistently asked us for GMO labeling, and we are doing so by focusing on where we have control: in our own stores,” Whole Foods Co-Chief Executive Officer Walter Robb said in a blog post on the company’s website.
The company plans to begin labeling produce and other products genetically modified and containing GMO substances by the next quarter, extending to company-wide labeling by 2018. Though this plan might cause friction between Whole Foods’ current suppliers, who may be negatively affected by the strategy, the approach is a powerful and strategic choice. It is highly unusual for grocery chains in the industry to label all GMO products, and by making a public announcement to do so, Whole Foods will set itself apart from its competitors and stand as a symbol of quality and transparency among its rivals.
The decision has already seen positive responses from consumers and activists. Activist and Chairman of Just Label It Gary Hirshberg responded to Whole Foods’ new strategy by calling it a “game changer.” Hirshberg said in a New York Times interview that “we’ve had some pretty big developments in labeling this year. Now, one of the fastest growing, most successful retailers in the country is throwing down the gauntlet.”
In fact, this approach might have positive impacts on the industry as a whole. Rivals of Whole Foods, including grocery chains such as Trader Joe’s and Safeway, might feel pressured to adopt similar standards for their own products. Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumers Union, referred to the decision in an interview with The Consumerist as “a good step forward in the marketplace, as it will put pressure on their competitors. And it helps with national call for mandatory labeling.” Mandatory labeling could transform the business practices of many different grocery chains and ultimately provide consumers with more information while keeping prices down through competition.
This might be the ideal situation for consumers and for companies. Though Whole Foods is beginning with GMO transparency, greater transparency overall could help improve the quality of products for more consumers. Though the exclusivity of the “health food” market might suffer as a result, the effect in terms of long-term benefits for consumers is positive and until now, unparalleled.
“I suppose there will always be a market for the cheapest possible food, but issues around water quality, farm workers, all that stuff, keep surfacing. There will be no place to hide in terms of what your practices are and what you’re doing,” Robb told Bloomberg News.
The effects of such a shift can be tremendous.
“We believe fundamentally in the customer’s right to know and the right to have the information necessary to make the choices they want to make on the products they want to buy,” Robb said.
Though it might seem like a small step towards corporate transparency, Whole Foods’ decision to implement mandatory labeling is actually a landmark case of a company using its considerable influence to set a standard for quality products.
At the very least, it sets a powerful precedent for corporate change in transparency. Whether this decision will pressure all grocers to behave in a similar way remains to be seen.

“This stuff is now a decade old. Normally I wouldn’t bother to respond, but there is enough dirt in the ethanol lobby that you really don’t need to drag in Chandra Levy. Alex Farrell is dead. Gary Condit and Dick Cheney are both alive, but not very relevant. Gray Davis is or was working for ADM to advance the cause of Midwest corn ethanol in California. No big surprises there.”
GMO fuel in your home water tap? Does the water providers check for cancer causing ethanol in your water?

This past Friday, Venezuelans mourned the passing of their president, Hugo Chavez, with a lavish funeral as well as enormous public demonstrations.
Meanwhile, in the United States, there were probably quite a few diplomatic officials quietly rejoicing over the imminent change in Venezuelan leadership. Chavez, although not a serious threat to U.S. interests, was a thorn in the side of the West and an ineffective and bombastic leader for his people.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Fundamentally, the death of Chavez will have regional and international implications in the realms of economic and security. At this time, the United States and the international community should act with haste then the United States has the opportunity to work for the greater good in not only Venezuela but other South American countries and beyond.
The first issue of security regards border tensions between Venezuela and Colombia. Chavez allowed Marxist FARC narcoterrorist revolutionaries to use Venezuela as a staging ground for incursions and attacks in Colombia against the agrarian peasantry, according to the BBC. The FARC, while significantly less powerful today than they were in the 1980s, are still a threat to peace and stability in the region.
Colombia, in trying to move away from being the cocaine capital of the world, has been working to eliminate the FARC, who traffic the drug to fund its war against the Colombian government. The primary casualties of the conflict, however, are the poor Colombian farmers in the region. Luckily, in preparing for the death of Chavez,  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said two months ago that he expects Venezuela, under the leadership of Vice President Nicolas Maduro, to support peace talks with the FARC, according to Reuters. The international community should also step in to lend support and legitimacy to the peace process to ensure the protection of civilians.
On issues of global security, Chavez was a vocal supporter of the Iranian security goals and opposition to Western influences under Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This is perhaps the most nuanced and important issue to arise from the death of Chavez.
According to international relations expert Kenneth Waltz, the international community should change its focus to Iran before the Middle Eastern country commits to nuclear weapons to ensure national security stability. To this effect, Chavez, in supporting Iran, gave that country an ally against the West and reduced the need for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon to ensure security.
Thus, the death of Chavez reduces the number of allies Iran has globally, and potentially increases the need for Iran to ensure its own security with greater weaponry or military force. Here, the international community needs to make Iranian leaders feel safe without allowing Iran to develop aggressive tactics.
By giving Iran a place at the international table — something that should be afforded to the nation with the second-largest oil exports in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — the international community could reduce Iran’s concerns and desire for nuclear weapons. This would likely require further talks and negotiations with Iran, reduced militarization from Israel, a lifting of sanctions against Iran and the ability for Iran to reach out to other nations such as Venezuela to create alliances and goodwill, but that all stands as a better alternative than continuing to pressure Iranian leadership. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said in a speech on campus in October, there is little the international community can do to halt Iranian nuclear proliferation using force; negotiations are our best option.
On the issue of economic security, the death of Chavez creates opportunity for capitalist expansion and aid programs in Latin America. Chavez, according to NPR, was a large donor of oil aid to surrounding areas to spur development and increase his influence in the region. The death of Chavez might herald a change in Venezuelan aid policies, because Venezuela is not as prosperous as Maduro might hope.
If Venezuela does begin to retract aid, the countries previously benefitting will be in a bind; the continued global economic slowdown has prevented these nations from growing and being self-sufficient.
In the interim, to ensure human security, the international community should step in and step up aid programs to create the infrastructure, education systems and health systems necessary to allow various South American countries to create economic development and build better lives for their people.
If the international community does not step in now, the imminent loss of Venezuelan oil subsidies could force most, if not all, of these nations to implement austerity measures that will further hurt their people and slow economic growth. For the interests of human dignity, the international community must strike while the iron is hot.

When freshman outfielder Vahn Bozoian smacked a sixth-inning solo home run in USC’s Sunday matinee against No. 12 UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Westwood, the Trojans were suddenly tied in a game that shouldn’t have been close. Bozoian’s homer was just USC’s second hit of the day, while the Bruins had already left nine runners on base at that point.
Yet the score stood at 1-1, and the Trojans were right there with a chance to steal the game. Until the bottom of the sixth, that is.
UCLA third baseman Kevin Kramer smacked a bases-clearing, three-RBI double against freshman pitcher Sean Adler to break the game open and give the Bruins a 4-1 lead. UCLA tacked on two more in the eighth to coast to a 6-1 victory.
“Obviously, Adler didn’t have it today,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “He made mistakes to the wrong part of the lineup and the wrong hitter, and he paid for it.”
UCLA starting pitcher Grant Watson was stellar, allowing just three hits over seven innings of one-run ball. He was a model of efficiency, throwing just 77 pitches, and didn’t walk a single Trojan batter.
“He’s a strike-thrower,” said USC senior outfielder Greg Zebrack, who was just 1-for-4 against Watson. “He was around the zone all game, but we couldn’t get many base runners on him. But he threw well, hats off to him.”
While the Bruins’ staff didn’t walk a single batter over nine innings, the Trojans walked nine over the eight that they pitched. Freshman starter Kyle Twomey issued five free passes over five laborious innings but pitched out of several jams and finished with just one unearned run.
“I thought Kyle [Twomey] got squeezed a bit,” Hubbs said. “But he really battled. He threw quite a few pitches that weren’t called strikes that could have been.”
Indeed, Hubbs could be seen jawing with home plate umpire Joe Maiden a number of times in the early innings, but his young pitcher kept the Trojans in the game. Twomey was removed before the sixth inning after throwing 112 pitches, many in high-stress situations.
But the bullpen let the Trojans down. Adler gave up two hits, a walk and a hit batsman to the four hitters he faced. He was replaced by fellow freshman Sean Silva, who walked three batters over two innings. Senior Matt Munson then came in and gave up two doubles and a single to the three batters he faced.
“We have to figure out who can pitch reliably out of the ‘pen,” Hubbs said. “But we kind of have to go with the hot hand. We have a lot of youth, and they pitch that way.”
The lone bright spot was freshman Marc Huberman, who sent the Bruins down in order in his one inning of work. But like many who have seen significant time out of the bullpen this year, Huberman is a freshman, and, therefore, prone to bouts of inconsistency.
Adler has allowed three hits, five walks and a hit batsman to the last eight batters he’s faced, being charged with four earned runs in the process. Prior to that, he had yet to allow so much as a hit in his five prior outings.
“Unless things start to change in the bullpen, we’re going to have to just play the matchups,” Hubbs said. “We don’t have the consistency back there to have a set order.”
After four-straight games against ranked teams, the Trojans get a small respite when they take on Pepperdine (7-8) tonight at 6 p.m., back home at Dedeaux Field.
