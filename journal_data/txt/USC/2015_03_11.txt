The No. 12 seeded Trojans shocked the Pac-12 by mounting one of the greatest comebacks in recent Trojan history, trailing by as much as 15 at one point, to upset No. 5 seeded Arizona State with a 67-64 victory.
Freshman Elijah Stewart led all scorers with a career high 27 points, including 6-8 from beyond the arc, and sophomore Nikola Jovanovic came up with a huge block in the final seconds to seal the upset for the Trojans   (12-19, 3-15).
Arizona State (17-15, 9-9) jumped to an early 32-17 lead before the Trojans ended the half on an 11-6 run to cut the deficit to 10 points, 28-38. Stewart led USC with 13 first half points and had an electrifying block on Jacobsen.
Being one of the youngest teams in the country has cost the Trojans dearly all season. Once again, the Trojans shot a better percentage than their opponents but suffered 10   first- half turnovers while allowing nine offensive rebounds that led to 12 second chance points.
It looked as if the Trojans were going to let another game slip away as a Jacobsen jumper gave the Sun Devils a 14-point lead with just over nine minutes to play. For the first time this season, the Trojans responded triumphantly, however.
For the remainder of the game, USC locked down on defense, holding the Sun Devils to just one field goal and two free throws. Jumpstarted by 10 straight points from Stewart, the Trojan offense appeared out of nowhere.
Back to back layups from sophomores Darion Clark and Julian Jacobs gave the Trojans their first lead of the game with just over a minute to play.
“We were ultra focused and remained poised,” Jacobs said. “I think that was the key.”
Shaquielle McKissic, who has played savior for Arizona State in the past, put the Trojans on their heels. McKissic scored on a hard drive to the basket to cut the lead to one point before attacking the rim with just seconds to play in hopes of saving the Sun Devils once again.
However, McKissic was met by a Serbian wall in Jovanovic. After McKissic beat Jacobs off the dribble, the second year big man rotated over and blocked McKissic’s layup with seven seconds to play. Stewart added two free throws to all but seal a victory.
While freshman phenom Jordan McLaughlin has been out of action with a shoulder injury, both Jacobs and Stewart have developed and blossomed their play.
“Elijah Stewart and Julian Jacobs are much better players than they were a month and a half ago,” said head coach Andy Enfield of starting backcourt.
Jacobs would finish with 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists.
McKissic led the Sun Devils with 16 points and nine rebounds and forward Bo Barnes contributed 15 points off the bench.
Enfield recorded his most impressive win since taking over the reigns of the Trojan program two years ago. While the Trojans have struggled this season, losing numerous close games down the stretch, they remained competitive and showed flashes of a great team in the making.
“We never let ourselves become defined by our close losses,” Enfield said. “We’ve never felt better about our future than right now.”
The Trojan’s victory was the first time in the history of the Pac-12 Tournament that a No. 12 seed has won a game. The win was also USC’s first Pac-12 victory away from the Galen Center this year and their first win in the tournament in four years.
USC will be rewarded with a matchup against cross town rivals No. 4 seed UCLA in the quarterfinals on Thursday afternoon.
“They’re on the bubble of making the tournament,” Jacobs said of playing UCLA. “And we’d love to stop them from making it.”
win over Washington gave the Trojans their third conference win of the season, which is more than they had all of last season.
UCLA is coming off a win over the Washington State Cougars (12-16, 6-10) by a score of 72-67 to keep their tournament chances alive. Senior guard Norman Powell scored a       game-high 28 points. Junior forward Tony Parker came off the bench to contribute 15 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore guard Bryce Alford and freshman forward Kevon Looney had 13 and 12 points respectively.
USC will try to play the role of spoiler against their rivals. If UCLA is able to take home the victory, they will have ended their season on a three-game winning streak. The strong ending to their season could give them a stronger case towards earning a berth in the tournament, but they still would not have a significant nonconference win under their belt. They lost to every ranked opponent they played during the year.
The last time these two teams squared off, the Bruins blew out the Trojans in the second half to secure the win. The Trojans fell to the Bruins 83-66 and they were out-rebounded by the crosstown rival 41-20. Jovanovic was the leading scorer for the Trojans the last time around with 20 points, but Powell and Alford shined for UCLA as they had 22 and 21 points respectively. The difference in the first meeting was the second half, during which UCLA shot 62.5 percent and extended the lead.
Jovanovic has been the most consistent player for USC this season although a big game against UCLA would help validate his skill set and give the young forward confidence heading into the off season ahead of next season.
“It was a big win because it’s a confidence boost,” Jovanovic said.
Jacobs has also shined in the absence of McLaughlin and has consistently been posting impressive stat lines. The captain of the squad has been near a triple double a couple of times, but it is his leadership on the court that has really made the difference. He has been more vocal in directing his teammates and calling plays. Jacobs knew that the win would be a huge boost heading into his junior year and was glad that he performed so well in front of the home crowd.
“We wanted to give them something to look forward to next year,” Jacobs said.
The game will be held at Pauley Pavilion and will tip off at 6 pm. The game will air on ESPN2.

USC hosted their annual Pro Day Wednesday afternoon at Cromwell Field, and the entire NFL came to the party.  Representatives from all 32 NFL teams made an appearance to see how the former Trojans would stack up performing a variety of on-field drills and workouts.
Fifteen former Trojans worked out for the NFL scouts.  Major contributors from the 2014-2015 football season were on display from all three sides of the ball.  Offensive players included wide receivers Nelson Agholor and George Farmer,  and running back Javorius “Buck” Allen.
The defensive side of the ball was just as stacked, if not more so, with showing from defensive backs Gerald Bowman and Josh Shaw, linebacker Hayes Pullard, and defensive linemen J.R. Tavai and Leonard Williams.
Farmer was perhaps the most surprising participant of Pro Day.  Farmer, a junior, was faced with substantial criticism when he decided to forgo a senior season.  Farmer had an injury-plagued career in which he only caught 30 total passes.
“I’ve been through a lot of adversity, a lot of coaching changes here, so I just felt like the NFL was a great opportunity for me,” Farmer said. After not being invited to the NFL Combine, Farmer attended a regional combine where his numbers attracted some buzz, but not the serious looks he will be getting following Wednesday’s performance.  Farmer ran a blistering 4.35 in the 40-yard dash, which would have been good enough to tie for third fastest in the position at the combine.
“It took a bunch of weight off my shoulders,” Farmer said.
Another prominent Trojan Wednesday was defensive back Josh Shaw.  Shaw was part of a dramatic off-field season for the Trojans.  After lying about the source of two ankle injuries, Shaw missed nearly the entire season, and was suspended for 10 games.  Shaw’s actions have been of some concern for NFL scouts, but Shaw said that he is confident in his chances to be drafted.
“I look them in the eye and tell them the truth — tell them everything that happened,” Shaw said. “And let them know that the mistake I made was really out of character and, most importantly, that I’ve learned from it.”
Shaw’s performance Wednesday was strong — he ran a 4.44 40-yard-dash time and benched 225 pounds 26 times.
Leonard Williams, a fan favorite, is a projected top-5 pick in the draft.  Williams impressed all the scouts as he competed in various position drills.  He was even given a private workout by the Tennessee Titans, who sent their defensive line coach specifically to look at Williams.
Williams and the other top prospects from USC will now take part in private workouts that they have scheduled with various teams, and await their fortune in the NFL draft, which starts on April 30.

President Barack Obama officially unveiled a “Student Aid Bill of Rights” this week,  a memorandum geared towards alleviating the burden on college students to repay their loans.
According to the presidential memorandum released by the White House, the bill aims to create a responsive student feedback system where students have the opportunity to file complaints about federal student loan lenders, servicers, collection agencies and institutions of higher education.Additionally, the bill looks to create high-quality, borrower-focused servicing and ensuring fair treatment for struggling and distressed borrowers by raising standards for student debt collectors.
During a speech to students at Georgia Institute of Technology, the president explained that the key to obtaining an income at or above middle-class wages is through a college degree. To do so, he said, students must be able to afford the financial burden of repaying monthly loans.
“And it [the bill] says every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education,” Obama said at Georgia Tech. “Every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college. Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan. Every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans.”
The presidential memorandum leads officials in the Department of Education and federal agencies to implement greater transparency for student loan holders. According to the White House, the secretary of education will create a new website on July 1, 2016, to provide a responsive student feedback system in which students are able to file complaints and feedback regarding financial aid and loan repayments, specifically targeted to decrease misleading claims.
“I didn’t run for president just to get us back to where we were — I ran for president to get us to where we need to go,” Obama said. “And where we need to go is a growing middle class with rising incomes and opportunities for everybody who’s willing to work hard.”
Prior to the release of the “Student Aid Bill of Rights,” Obama released the “Pay As You Earn” plan which grants student borrowers the ability to cap federal loan payments at 10 percent of their living wages, proposed plans to make two years of community college free for students, granted $75 million to colleges and universities through the First in the World program and announced 600 new commitments to help help increase the student graduation rate.
In the bill, the president included steps to prioritize the needs of student borrowers by pairing the Department of Education, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget to analyze which best fit practices will benefit student borrowers.
“So based on this principle, we’re going to make sure universities are using technology to help students learn at lower costs,” Obama said. “We’re going to make sure that loan servicers can find better ways to help borrowers keep up with monthly payments that they can afford.  We as a country can do more to invest in Pell grants and community college to make sure quality education is affordable for everybody.”
The memorandum also focuses on helping borrowers afford monthly loan payments by ensuring that loan servicing agencies provide fair interest rates on federal student loans and require loan disclosures.
Obama explained that every individual, regardless of party preference, should sign the bill and encouraged all citizens interested in bolstering a stronger workforce for the future to take action by signing the bill online.
“It’s a simple set of principles that if everybody signed onto — Republicans, Democrats, state legislators, university presidents, members of Congress — it can focus our attention, all these different things that we’re doing, into one simple, basic idea, which is, make sure that when you’re doing the right thing, that your society has got your back and is looking out for you,” Obama said.
Legislative bills are not created by presidential memo. They are created by the Legislative Branch of gov. Don’t believe everything you hear from the president, he’s known for not telling the truth, in order to gain favor with his electorate.

Undergraduate Student Government Residential Senator Aziz Akbari has proposed the creation of a Religious Student Assembly to integrate faith-based student organizations with USG. Akbari is currently working on a formal resolution to create the assembly.
Akbari is set to present the proposal for RSA to Program Board on Tuesday, March 24. If the proposal passes, it will reach the Senate that same day for another presentation preceding the final vote.
To create the resolution, Akbari is working with Jim Burklo, associate dean of religious life; Varun Soni, dean of religious life; Andy Su, USG Diversity Affairs delegate and Luke Phillips, former Political Student Assembly director.
Akbari said that the goal of RSA would be for students allow themselves to better connect to religious organizations.
“We’re trying to create a network of religious [organizations] in USG so that they can mainly co-program to do interfaith work and bring awareness about the work that they’re doing individually,” Akbari said.
According to Soni, the new assembly will help religious groups become more closely affiliated with to USG.
“At USC we have more student religious groups than any American university,” Soni said. “There is this remarkable tapestry of diverse religious tradition on our campus. The idea of an assembly is that these students can work together with USG and collaborate in a way that just wouldn’t be possible otherwise.”
Akbari explained that the creation of RSA would create a greater sense of diversity in USG.
“The biggest way that [the assembly is] benefiting USG is through the diversity,” Akbari said. “It will be an addition of student [organizations] that are in program board which I think is the biggest benefit that USG is receiving from this because they’re getting more diversity in the types of organizations that are in USG and the voices that are being heard within USG.”
Akbari also said that RSA would establish greater opportunities for religious organizations and leaders of other organizations to collaborate in putting on interfaith events.
Additionally, Akbari said that he would like to see religious groups use the assembly to put on more volunteer events.
“Personally, I would like to see a lot of engagement in interfaith community service, because community service is something that’s kind of pan religious and something that almost every religious denomination encourages, and I think that’s one of the great ways we can facilitate all these groups coming together and working with one another,” Akbari said.
Soni said that the assembly would grant USG the opportunity to represent a more diverse set of perspectives on campus.
“Undergraduate Student Government represents all students on campus … and having as diverse of a point of view as possible allows Undergraduate Student Government to fulfill its mission in serving the entire university student body, “ Soni said.
Soni also agrees with Akbari’s view that the implementation of RSA will allow student and religious organizations to pull their shared ideas to work on large projects collaboratively.
“Our religious student groups are interested in many of the same issues that other assemblies are interested in, especially in terms of social justice, environmental stewardship, free speech issues [and] civil rights. There’s a lot of collaboration that can happen within the framework of undergraduate student government,” Soni said.
Soni accredited student leaders in creating the new assembly.
“Our student leaders deserve all the credit and they’re working closely with other student leaders,” Soni said. “Undergraduate student government is for the students by the students, so I see my role as an advocate and advisor, but I really see the students as taking the leads on this.”

John Carlson, a graduate student studying regulatory science in a yearlong exchange program at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, has had an experience not many other students have had while abroad.
Carlson, who is in the progressive degree program and is also finishing his degrees in biochemistry and East Asian languages and cultures, met with the United States Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy on March 10 to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami disasters that occurred off the coast of the Tohoku region of Japan in 2011.
Carlson has received funding through two scholarships for his studies. Through one of them, the Morgan Stanley U.S.-Japan Bridging Foundation Scholarship, he along with two other American students were invited by the TOMODACHI program to meet Ambassador Kennedy, U.S.-Japan Council President Irene Hirano Inouye and Minister of Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida.
Inouye, a USC alumna, earned her bachelors of science and master’s degrees in public administration from 1966 to 1972. Shinzo Abe, the current prime minister of Japan, also has Trojan ties — in 1978, he studied at USC for one year at the Price School of Public Policy.
The TOMODACHI Initiative was created in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster that aims to foster Japanese and American relations through educational and cultural programs, including study abroad opportunities. The initiative is a result of a partnership between the U.S.-Japan Council and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo as well as private sector companies.
“They try to facilitate student exchange, bringing students from the U.S. to Japan, and Japan to the U.S.” Carlson said.
In addition to the opportunities provided by the TOMODACHI Initiative, Carlson attributes his study abroad program and past involvement with USC’s East Asia Studies Center to helping him develop the skills necessary for his current work experiences.
Carlson, who was previously an intern at the Washington, D.C. offices of EMD Serono, an international pharmaceutical company, now works for the business’ Japanese headquarters in Tokyo. He is a graduate intern in the Government Affairs and Market Access and Pricing department of EMD Serono, which is known as Merck Serono in Japan.
“My focus is ensuring the market landscape is favorable, or at least it’s open, to rewarding innovation and allowing for new products on the market,” he said.
His speech at the meeting focused on both the positive educational experiences he has had while in Japan as well as how his work can promote economic revitalization in Japan. Carlson spoke on behalf of the three American students present at the event, and another student spoke on behalf of the five Japanese students invited, all of whom were born in the Tohoku region and were impacted in some capacity by the disaster.
“At that meeting we presented both our condolences in terms of reaffirming our generation, the Tomodachi generation’s condolences to the people who lost their lives and the rebuilding of the Tohoku region that’s still going on today, and we also discussed the future of U.S.-Japan relations,” he said.
He said that due to the high-profile nature of the meeting, his remarks had to be reviewed before the meeting by meeting organizers, and he was not able to speak about the event until after it took place.
In addition to the remarks, Carlson and the students had an opportunity to share their experiences about studying in Japan as well as the nature of U.S.–Japan ties.
“We discussed primarily our experience studying in Japan in terms of the great opportunity we’ve had, the close bonds we’ve created with Japanese students, and then our future,” Carlson said. “For us, the future is looking at increasing collaboration between the two countries, focusing not only on academia partnerships but on corporate partnerships so continuing to develop the leaders of both Japan and the U.S. together with the future of U.S.-Japan relations in mind.”
Though Carlson has plans to later attend law school, he said that his science background contributed to his desire to use innovative technologies in the pharmaceutical industry. He believes Japan particularly can benefit from such technologies.
“In Japan, there’s a large focus on science innovation, especially in its pharmaceutical industry, and it’s something that I’m passionate about in terms of my background in science,” he said.
He hopes to use his time working in Japan to create positive change.
“[My background] makes me want to bring innovative products to patients in Japan, and Japan being the powerhouse that it is in research, to have that opportunity to create new products that could change peoples’ lives — that was my [motivation] in terms of when I gave the talk,” Carlson said. “I stressed the innovation, and I stressed the economic revitalization because that’s going to make the future better in terms of strengthening Japan at the corporate and economic level — it’s just going to make the bonds last even longer.”

On Tuesday night, the No. 7 Trojans fell to No. 15 Penn State (7-9, 4-0 EIVA) in three straight sets (18-25, 19-25, 21-25). The upset over USC was Penn State’s first win over a ranked opponent in 2015.
With the non-conference loss, the Trojans move to a season record of 10-6. They’re currently in fifth place in the Mounain Pacific Sports Federation with a 9-5 conference record.
Tonight the Trojans take on Lindenwood (5-6, 2-5 MIVA). This will be the first time the Trojans face off against the Lions.
Head coach Bill Ferguson looks optimistically to tonight’s match, considering the Trojans’ poor play against Penn State, which Ferguson was not pleased with.
“[This match] was not anywhere close to an effort that is representative of this team,” Ferguson said.
Right from the start, it looked like it would be a tough match for the Trojans. Penn State jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first set and ran away with it to finish off the set 25-18. Penn State held the lead the entire set.
Four early service errors by USC aided Penn State’s first set dominance.
Much of the same played out again in the second set. The Nittany Lions found themselves in a groove, and USC began to wander off track — the Nittany Lions caught fire while the Trojans were more or less on ice. The momentum translated well into the third set for Penn State, and the Nittany Lions took the set and the match.
“A hallmark of our team has been our ability to compete and come back,” Ferguson said. “I don’t know where that was tonight.”
The biggest drop-off for the Trojans was their lack of offensive effectiveness: USC hit .198 to Penn State’s .422, an opponent-high hitting percentage. For a team that was once unstoppable at the net, this is a stat that really hurts.
The Nittany Lions’ dominant offense came from senior Aaron Russell, who had 20 kills and only two hitting errors for a .720 hitting percentage.
The Trojans had no one who could snuff Russell’s hot streak. Ferguson set up the rotation to have senior setter Micah Christenson block Russell at the net.
“It was surprising that Micah couldn’t stop Russell,” Ferguson said. “That was the matchup I wanted.”
On offense for the Trojans, junior opposite hitter Josh Kirchner led the team with 11 kills. Junior outside hitter Alex Slaught recorded a second-best seven kills. Ferguson attributes the lack of offensive firepower to the team’s inability to find its rhythm.
“Our offense was just out of whack all night,” Ferguson said.
For Ferguson, the best part about the match against Lindenwood is that the team knows nothing about the Lions.
“It’s going to force us to focus on us,” Ferguson said. “Exactly what the doctor ordered.”
USC will try to get back in the win column against the Lions tonight at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.
What does that say about the coaching staff. They have lost their ability to get the team to focus. Chemistry stinks right now.
Maybe Lucas Yoder will get a chance to play or is he still in the proverbial dog house.

The No. 2 ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team will kick off the program’s third official season on Thursday against TCU at Merle Norman Stadium.
Last season the Women of Troy started to make a name for themselves as a team to be reckoned with by being ranked number one for most of the season. They defeated several ranked teams including Pepperdine, Florida State and crosstown rival UCLA.
Going into the American Volleyball coaches Association championships ranking No. 1, the Women of Troy lost to No. 2 Pepperdine in the semi-finals, with a score of 3-2. They finished the season with a record of 23-3, which is seven more wins than they had in the 2013 season. This season, however, head coach Anna Collier has the team thinking in a new perspective after the tough loss in the semi-finals last year.
“We get so locked up in wanting to win a championship,” Collier said. “We took a different philosophy this year in that we just want to play better, match by match, week by week, tournament by tournament and then see what the results are.”
Last year, AVCA all-American then-freshman Sara Hughes led the team with her partner then senior Kirby Burnham, setting a combined record of 42-4 including dual and tournament play. This pairing also won the AVCA Pairs National Championship, defeating Hawaii’s pairing of Karissa Cook and Brittany Tiegs in two sets.  Last season, Hughes had a hitting percentage of .477, 261 digs and 50 service aces.
After making it to the AVCA semi-finals back to back, the Women of Troy are locked in and ready to make a serious push to win a team national championship. The pairings are very deep from the first pair down to the fifth pair and they all have the ability to play win their matches. The team has also received several transfers including graduate student Meg Norton, freshman Jo Kremer and sophomore Sophie Bukovec.
Now a sophomore, Hughes still is the leader of the team, and she has been improving her game during the offseason.
“I have worked really hard in the weight room and in conditioning,” Hughes said. “The extra conditioning in the weight room has improved my speed and jump in the sand and I can get to more balls defensively.”
Hughes will be in the No. 1 pair but with a new partner this time with fellow sophomore Kelly Claes.
With such a deep team, a pairing that could be the season’s dark horse is senior Eve Ettinger and Norton. Both have been making big improvements on the court and they have finally started to click. They will either be the third or fourth pairing.
The Women of Troy will host TCU, Florida State and Loyola Marymount at Merle Norman Stadium to kick off the regular season on Thursday. This is the first year for TCU’s program but Florida State and Loyola Marymount have been strong competition for the Women of Troy. Bukovec, who transferred to USC from the indoor volleyball team at Long Beach State, thinks this will be a great test early on in the season for the team.
“We should match up well against these teams,” Bukovec said. “We have been training really hard for the past few months and each day we have been getting better and more competitive. It will be nice to play at home with a crowd.”
Both Florida State and Loyola Marymount are loaded with upperclassman who have been consistently playing year round. While Florida State returns only senior Jace Pardon from their top pair, Loyola returns both senior Litara Keil and senior Betsi Metter to their top pair. The Women of Troy will have an advantage in the middle pairings, where they were dominant last season.
This season will be extremely grueling for the Women of Troy, however, as they will be playing Pepperdine, Hawaii and Florida State, all ranked in the top five. Nonetheless, the teams hopes to start the season on a high note with  wins over No. 3 Florida State and No. 6 Loyola Marymount.
First serve for the Women of Troy’s match against TCU is scheduled for 5 p.m.

The first time I encountered the NFL-bound Leonard Williams is quite the story, actually.
Once upon a time, Lane Kiffin was still at the helm of the Trojans coming off the team’s embarrassing loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl, and it was the first spring practice of 2013. If I remember correctly, Kiffin had the notorious “Don’t talk about it, be about it” slogan imprinted on the field, and we all know how that turned out.
At the time, Ed Orgeron, better known as Coach O, was still in charge of the defensive line, and I was working with Orgeron’s unit as a student trying out to become a team manager, though, I only lasted in that gig for a week or so.
To this day, I still remember the fear that struck me when Coach O instructed me to run towards the left side of the line of scrimmage, as if I were an opposing running back, and there he was , all six-foot-five, 300 pounds of Williams, who was then just a young freshman.
Then, I thought to myself, “This guy is going to be one hell of a football player in the NFL one day.”
About two years, 20 sacks and 218 tackles later, the two-time all-American is projected to be at top-three pick in the NFL Draft by ESPN’s Todd McShay and Mel Kiper. The greater part of his draft preparation culminated on Wednesday with the program’s annual Pro Day, which is always a spectacle at USC.
In my three years covering the event, I’ve seen the likes of Matt Barkley, Robert Woods and Marqise Lee come through this event and show their skills, speed and athleticism off to NFL scouts.
Year in and year out, there always seem to always be that one superstar for the Trojans that attracts a good majority of the overall media attention, but also helps out his teammates by bringing out scouts from all 32 NFL teams, as was the case on Wednesday.
In 2013, it was Barkley; in 2014, it was Lee; this year, it was Williams.
Tennessee Titans defensive line coach Giff Smith was the one running Williams’s through position drills. The Titans currently hold the number two overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft.
At the end of the day, though, we already knew that Williams is going to be top pick, regardless of his performance on Pro Day.
As much as the pageantry and allure of it all surrounded Williams, though, the day carried much more importance for the other Trojans with NFL aspirations participating.
Players like wide receivers Nelson Agholor and George Farmer and running back Javorius “Buck” Allen especially benefited when it came to showing what they can do and improving their draft stock.
Farmer, in particular, had a lot to prove after being one of the nation’s top recruits in 2011 and then struggling to stay healthy in college; he didn’t really emerge until this past season when he caught for a little over 300 yards and four touchdowns as a junior.
Everyone was surprised when Farmer decided to leave school early and declare for the draft, but he silenced some of the doubters when he ran the 40-yard dash in an official time of 4.35 seconds.
For someone with a chip on their shoulder after not being invited to in the NFL Scouting Combine, Farmer’s impressive time, which is up there with the top-5 times from the Combine, definitely enhanced his chances at being drafted.
On the defensive side of the ball, cornerback Josh Shaw is taking all the field time in front of scouts he can get after a shortened senior season following his fabrication of rescuing his drowning nephew in the pool that resulted in an embarrassing debacle both for him and the program.
Yet Shaw has only improved his draft stock since the end of last season after standing out at the East-West Shrine game and the Senior Bowl, in addition to impressing scouts at the Combine.
It all culminated with Shaw showing his maturity on Pro Day though, by taking full responsibility for his actions in front of the media, saying that he truly regretted everything he did.
All in all, Pro Day is special because it’s a representation of childhood dreams coming true for many of these athletes, though, it’s also proof of USC’s ability to breed professional ball players, which serves as an excellent recruiting tool. It’s in the Trojan’s DNA.
By producing 483 NFL Draft picks all-time, more than any school but Notre Dame, and having more than 50 former Trojans on NFL rosters at the start of training camps last summer, USC has catapulted itself to becoming one of the nation’s top “football factories.”
Based on what I’ve now seen at a trio of pro days, there’s no doubt that the USC pipeline is literally, the “Fertile Cresent,” for professional scouts and based on the talent continuing to come in year after year via top-ranked recruiting classes, I don’t see that changing any time soon.

Randy Lawrence’s home immediately stands out as you drive up the windy, hilly roads of Echo Park’s residential community. Colored glass bottles, brightly painted handprints and depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe distinguish the home from rows of unassuming tan bungalows, set back from the road and obscured by foliage.
The home is easily recognizable, and so is the homeowner. After parking in front of the house, we hesitated for a moment, wondering if we should trapeze through the artwork to knock on the front door. We soon spotted Randy proudly standing on the curb, however, in an outfit that matched his art display. On his shirt, the Virgin of Guadalupe. On his pants, two large handprints.
“Welcome to Randyland! Welcome to Randyland!” he greeted each of us enthusiastically.
“Randyland” is another name for “Phantasma Gloria,” an adaptation of the ancient Greek word phantasmagoria, which means a series of dream-like images. The sculpture is a large tribute to the Virgin of Guadalupe, another title for the Virgin Mary.
Obviously, imagery of the Virgin of Guadalupe is found all over the globe. But according to Randy, his own front yard boasts the largest glass version of the figure. Though there are plenty of stone and tile versions of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Randy’s use of glass bottles and colored water makes his unique.
The idea for Phantasma Gloria came to Randy well over a decade ago, when he was enthralled by the horizon reflected through a blue bottle full of water on his window sill.
“I realized I could make a mosaic image out of the living sky itself,” he said. “The basic element, instead of tile, is a lens that is projecting the sky with the sun in it. And since the sky is alive, the image is alive because its constantly changing as the sun moves.”
Instead of forming a mosaic out of tiles, Randy created a mosaic using sunlight. The sculpture is anything but uniform; it features glass bottles of different shapes and sizes, some filled by colored water.
In addition to the glass Virgin of Guadalupe mosaic, the figure is featured in large cutouts along the stairs. When the lighting is right, the sun shines directly through the cutout, creating a shadow on the stairs that matches the figure.
Randy studied economics at UC Santa Cruz, and now builds sets in Hollywood, relying on the same construction skills that built his flashy yard decoration. Though he readily admits that he doesn’t come from a scientific background, Randy prefers to describe his work in scientific terms.
For example, when the sun shines through convex bottles, it appears to be splitting in two — a phenomenon Randy dubs “sun mitosis.” Sun mitosis occurs in the large bottle positioned as the Virgin’s belly, which hosts both “the son, s-o-n, and the sun, s-u-n,” Randy said, chuckling.
After “Welcome to Randyland,” Randy’s second catchphrase is “refraction in action.” Refraction is the bending of light as it passes through various mediums. In terms of Phantasma Gloria, refraction happens as sunlight passes through glass bottles, and the colored water inside of them. If you’re wondering, the best time to catch refraction in action at Randyland is mid-morning or late afternoon.
“Any artist just wants to create something novel and beautiful, that evokes powerful feelings,” Randy said. When I realized I essentially had a new medium -— art made of the sky itself — I wanted to explore it as much as possible.”
The first thing that came to mind when I saw the 40-foot sculpture was, “What do the neighbors think?” Randy reassured us that his neighbors are very supportive, a sentiment that I didn’t fully believe until multiple residents walked by, cheerfully greeting Randy.
Randy’s neighborhood and home choice weren’t an accident; he specifically chose his home because it features an eye-level platform that lends itself to art displays. He began working on the sculpture in 2001, during what he jokingly called “a late mid-life crisis.” Though Randyland was featured in a Los Angeles Times article several years ago, his art still remains relatively unknown.
The sculpture is constantly changing; Randy has displayed four different glass bottle configurations since first starting the project. We wanted to enter the yard itself, for a behind-the-scenes view of the sculpture, but unfortunately, the area was off-limits. Randy is transforming the space into a seating area where visitors can admire Phantasma Gloria while socializing.
Enthusiastic and talkative, Randy easily filled an hour explaining his project to us. And by the time we walked to the car, Randy had already moved on to his next set of visitors, receiving them with the ever cheerful “Welcome to Randyland!”

I’m lucky enough to be one of Randy’s neighbors … I get to see this every day! Good article – wish you had included a photo of the sculpture too, though.

Carter Feuerhelm and Daniel Moya met on the Cinema Floor in New/North during their first semester of freshman year. The two film and television production majors lived across the hall from each other and quickly formed a comedy video group with several other film students, but the two always had their own special rapport.
“We say a lot of nonsense words,” Feuerhelm said. “The word ‘yipsie’ came to me. And then Carter followed it up …” Moya said. “Bipsie,” finished Carter, in true best friend form.
“It was just like that,” Moya added. “So then we started to apply it to things. This is a yipsie, this is a bipsie.”
Feuerhelm agreed. “We loved the idea of applying it to anything. But especially movies.”
The two realized that they had to start putting these “yips” and “bips” somewhere, and thus they created a Twitter account devoted to the two characters.
It wasn’t until this year that the two finally found the proper venue to debut their characters. At the beginning of last semester, Feuerhelm and fellow School of Cinematic Arts student Rick Cisario launched The Breakdown — a news parody show broadcast live on Trojan Vision every Friday. The Breakdown provided the perfect platform to allow the yipsie and bipsie characters to come alive.
Feuerhelm said that the two bounce ideas off each other to create material for the show.
“Usually the night before we’ll sit down together at a Google Doc, and we’ll just write and pitch ideas to each other, back and forth. And do whatever it takes to make each other laugh,” Feuerhelm said.
The entire process takes about three hours, and the following morning they rehearse “a million times” before going live on air.
“Sometimes the teleprompter is too slow or too fast. Sometimes we cut each other off. We try to keep it spontaneous,” Moya said.
The humor that this pair exhibits has a unique flavor to it. For example, when asked about the recently released film Nightcrawler, Moya said, “I liked it. You wouldn’t know that from the tweet.” This is basically captures yipsie and bipsie’s entire methodology.
“The reviews have nothing to do with the film. The whole thing is really a sketch comedy bit,” Moya said. “It almost sounds like we’re three universes deeper. We’re operating on a whole different plane of existence.”
“Nobody’s watching movies the way we’re watching these movies,” Feuerhelm said.
Despite the fact that both Feuerhelm and Moya have found themselves working on several comedy projects together, Moya doesn’t think he will pursue a career in comedy. In fact, Moya admits to having no comedy experience before coming to USC.
“Most of the stuff I make is very dark. Morbidly dark. I like dark stories,” Moya said. “You definitely can apply that same darkness to comedy, which is good because I don’t feel bad about making something like that because then I can just go to yipsie or bipsie later,” Moya said.
Feuerhelm is the opposite. In addition to envisioning a future in the genre, Feuerhelm already has a handle on his style.
“I feel like my comedy brand is so silly. It’s not really based in reality,” Feuerhelm said. “I think my humor tends to verge on the dark or the nonsensical,” he said.
Nonetheless, the two believe they work best together.
“We find ways to integrate all of our sensibilities.” Moya said.
The two have also found a way to integrate Moya’s vast collection of black clothing into their yipsie and bipsie characters.
“He wears black; I wear white.” Feuerhelm said.
The two feel like their characters could have a future beyond USC.
“It could easily be a web series. Or a podcast.” Feuerhelm said. “But almost without a doubt, we will expand it into other formats.”
At one point during the interview, after mentioning a movie off hand, Moya said, “Oh, I liked that movie.” A fraction of a second later, he added, “Yipsie.”
Feuerhelm nodded his head. “I agree. Bipsie!”
Whether either of them had actually seen the film they review may never truly be known. At least not as long as yipsie and bipsie are around.
You can catch Yipsie and Bipsie every other Friday at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Trojan Vision. You can also follow them on Twitter for daily reviews @YiporBip.

Most USC students remember their college application season well: meticulously written essays, carefully assembled resumes and maybe the occasional interview. For students in the School of Dramatic Arts’ highly competitive acting program, applications include an additional component, a grueling audition. Out of the countless potential television, theater and movie stars who apply to the program, only about 20 end up at USC in the fall.
One such admittee, Jones, began his freshman year with a specific goal in mind: challenging black stereotypes in the media.
“Ultimately, I believe that theater, television and just the arts in general have the ability to change the mindsets of people across the nation,” Jones said. “I want to change the view of the black man in America, so that people can see that we all aren’t the stereotypes portrayed on television.”
For Jones, getting into USC represented a dream come true.
“Even before I wanted to act, I was in love with this school,” Jones said. “As early as my freshman year of high school, this was the school I wanted to come to.”
Jones’s first acting experience was a required middle school performance of Shakespeare’s King Lear, in which Jones played the King himself. The show sparked an interest in acting, and Jones began preforming in improv shows. Though he spent most of high school juggling sports and acting, Jones’s junior year marked a turning point. He decided to focus primarily on acting, noting support from his parents as one of his motivators.
“I liked acting but saw it as just something to do for fun,” Jones said. “It was my mom and dad who really told me that I should go to college for this.”
The audition process for the B.F.A. in acting program requires applicants to memorize two contrasting monologues, for example one classical and one contemporary. They’re also asked to have a third monologue prepared, just in case judges ask them to perform something else.
“Compared to all my other college auditions, I wasn’t that scared or nervous [for USC’s audition] because I felt very welcomed,” Jones said.
Jones only performed one monologue during his audition, a scene from the contemporary play, Fences, by August Wilson. It wasn’t the first time Jones was rewarded for this performance; it once earned him fifth place in the Dramatic Interpretation category of California’s Speech and Debate competition. The competition requires performers to cut a play into a 10-minute piece, and perform the roles of multiple characters.
The School of Dramatic Arts program uniquely offers conservatory-level intensity within the traditional college experience. Traditionally, acting and arts conservatories focus primarily on professional training, with extensive instruction in voice and movement techniques. Additionally, students take courses on topics like the history of theater, stagecraft and critical studies.  The B.F.A. in acting program at USC offers this same instruction, but students also take USC’s traditional general education courses, and can supplement their theater training with minors. Jones would like to minor in writing for screen and television, in order to one day work both in front of and behind the camera.
And Jones isn’t in acting merely for the possibility of fame; he hopes to utilize his talents to combat prominent racial stereotypes in the media.
“I just hope that [my work] helps people see our country’s citizens as people and not as stereotypes,” Jones said. “Eventually, I hope we can just see a man as a man — not as a black man, a white man or an Asian man.”
In addition to acting, Jones is already combatting prominent stereotypes through his music. During the controversial Ferguson decision, Jones and a friend, Cole Pham, harnessed their emotions into a song. Jones said the two already had plans to record a song about racial profiling, but Ferguson pushed them into action.
“When the Mike Brown trial ended and he wasn’t convicted, I felt betrayed by my own country, because it made me feel like I was less of a human being and that my brothers and cousins and friends were less,” Jones said. “We made the song because arts are an avenue for us to express our emotions and explain our opinions.”
The song, titled “Who’s Next,” is written from the perspective of the consciousness of an emerging artist who was just shot, as he is transported to the hospital. The song, which is available on Jones’s SoundCloud account (Kosmosis Jones), includes haunting sounds from actual footage of a police shooting in New Orleans.
“When you get into politics, everything is red versus blue, he said she said, but music is bipartisan.  When we made this song, we wanted to put the listener, regardless of their background, in the shoes of whoever’s next,” Jones said.
Though only a freshman, Jones is eager to bring his goal of altering stereotypes to USC’s many acting opportunities. Drawing from his prior experience in improv, Jones currently performs on Trojan Vision’s new sketch comedy show, SCA Live. The show’s next episode is scheduled to air on Friday, March 27.

After a video surfaced in which Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers at the University of Oklahoma singing racist chants, OU President David Boren expelled the two SAE leaders featured in the video. The incident is indicative of a lack of diversity in university institutions, a lack of accountability and apathy toward race-based hatred — and it should make people rethink our efforts to reduce ignorance in the community.
Boren also posted a response on Facebook which directly held the OU chapter of SAE responsible, while redoubling university efforts to build community. “To those who have misused their free speech in such a reprehensible way, I have a message for you. You are disgraceful. You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves ‘Sooners.’ Real Sooners are not racist,” he said in the statement.
In an era in which university responses to hatred among students are often too little too late, Boren’s swift and stern condemnation is the leadership that OU needs to combat a culture of racial superiority and ignorance that allowed the OU’s SAE chapter to tout their exclusion of black students.
“I think it happened because the guys on the bus had an attitude of complacency and a sense of security,” University of Oklahoma sophomore Kristen Baird said. Another video was posted of the same incident, in which the leader of the chant waves at the camera and touts the same reprehensible comfort.
One must take a critical look at the system that permits an attitude of prejudice — namely, the Greek system, which fosters this attitude by excluding minorities and glorifying legacy. At OU, SAE had no black members, and certainly it is not the only fraternity to discriminate against minorities. The lack of diversity in Greek institutions is a detrimental enabler for ignorance of other groups.
“I know there are groups within OU that are not diverse. When you lack diversity and you lack the perspective of others, a chant like this might seem like nothing when in actuality, it’s unacceptable. If they had diversity in their organization, they would have thought twice about it,” Baird said.
At USC, diversity has been widely discussed, and yet in many instances  the conversation about more race issues stop short. In the Greek context, the issue is one of representation: when people don’t see others who look like themselves in Greek organizations, it discourages their involvement, further increasing the lack of diversity within these organizations. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the organization to foster a mutually beneficial climate of inclusion — and this is a lesson that Greek life at OU, USC and any other university could benefit from.
The Greek system also fosters a culture of insensitivity by worshipping legacy and tradition. It has been said repeatedly that the culture surrounding the SAE chant was not isolated — and while the attitude of the chant has certainly been prevalent in the conduct of the OU chapter, the chant itself pervaded  other chapters of SAE as well.
“I was an SAE at a university in Texas from 2000 to 2004,” one Twitter user said. “The exact same chant was often used then.” The historical context of the chant, especially considering that SAE was founded during the Civil War in the Confederacy, calls into question the worship of traditions which can perpetuate racism.
Worshipping tradition for tradition’s sake — a core component of many fraternities — detrimental because it transforms into a mechanism in which racism is reinforced and unchecked. SAE can never erase its roots that, quite frankly, stem from white supremacy, and it should make every effort to shed its previous legacy instead of continuing to revere it.
As bystanders of this incident, it’s important for us to realize that it is not enough to condemn the racism at OU’s SAE and move on with our lives. “I hope there isn’t a neat little bow put on this issue,” Baird said.
A “neat little bow” is indeed what will stop progress to eliminate individualized prejudice and the systemic racism; the necessity to preserve the image that “we’re not racist” has long overshadowed the efforts to actually reduce racism. A generation that enjoys embracing their superficial — and nonexistent — colorblindness needs acceptance of the pervasiveness of institutionalized racism, commitment to isolate its sources and recognition that “subtler forms of discrimination,” as Boren has put it, are insidious in fostering racist attitudes. The actions to eliminate racism need to come “Sooner” rather than later.
Most importantly, the OU fraternity members needs to act now. Sooner, rather than later.

Last week, the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram swore allegiance to the Islamic State. If there’s anything worse than one threatening terrorist organization declaring its loyalty to another, even more hostile group, it is the fact that Boko Haram did so through an audio message shared on Twitter.
The arc of many news narratives and the source of many of the world’s woes over the past several months have intersected, and now we find out about Boko Haram’s declaration on Twitter, a platform that produces inane celebrity wars. The pledge is ostensibly troubling. The group of terrorists who prompted the worldwide #BringBackOurGirls campaign have decided to team up with the barbaric extremists who produce videos of beheadings and kidnappings of innocent people. This creation, to borrow the words of noted political advisor David Frum, of an “axis of evil” at first suggests the formation of a powerful terrorist conglomerate in the Middle East, but it in fact betrays the increasingly unstable and fragmented leadership within both groups.
Recent international news headlines have been dominated by reports and stories of Boko Haram kidnapping children in Nigerian villages and denying them education, all while looking to expand its territorial control. If it’s not Boko Haram, it’s ISIS. ISIS has been in the news so much that almost everyone has an opinion on it. The videos of beheadings that ISIS has put online have become almost countless, which is alarming. The international community has become far too complacent in its strategy to defeat terrorists. A world where near weekly videos of mass murder and violence can be posted online without any immediate ramifications is not only disconcerting, but also a complete failure of world leaders to wipe out radical ideologues with an inhumane agenda to to wipe out radical ideologues with no regard for humanity.
With an incontrovertible core of extremism and intolerance, it is no surprise that a terrorist organization would have difficulty in its efforts to fortify allies supporting its actions. If there is anything to take away from Boko Haram’s message swearing allegiance to the Islamic State, it is the group’s apparent weakness and struggle to exist. Rather than signifying its strength and power, the fact that Boko Haram would even entertain the idea of aligning itself with another terrorist organization illustrates that the supporters of its philosophy are balking and the stamina of its crusade is wavering. With most of the attention being paid to the Islamic State, Boko Haram is left in the shadows, marginalized to the alleys of NPR sidebar news. As the saying goes, if you can’t beat them, join them.
The vulnerable position that Boko Haram is in provides an opportunity to stamp it out and reignite the fight to defeat ISIS. Boko Haram’s signals of allegiance indicate paralysis in the organization’s expansion and growth. As the flames of both groups’ highly extremist views continue to burn out, an allegiance between the two is not a cause for fear or panic, but rather an opportunity to batter the enemy down and begin to deconstruct the bubble of radicalism and intolerance the groups have sought to build.
To the international community, Boko Haram’s video sends signs of weakness. Ultimately, that might contribute to the organization’s demise.

Midterm week is full of mixed emotions. Most of us are probably crying over multiple midterms, inconvenient additional assignments and projects professors made due this week, and the fact that the only sleep we’re getting might be in Leavey. But at the same time Trojans, today is Wednesday which means you’ve almost made it through the week and that spring break is right around the corner!
At times like this, we may find ourselves slacking in terms of smart snacking. Here are some easy and brain fueling snacks that won’t take up too much of your studying time but will help you power through the rest of the day.

Grab-and-go snacks:
–A handful of nuts. Nuts require no preparation and are easy to grab when you’re trying to make it to your study session on time. The salty snack will give you a quick energy boost and the fiber and protein will keep you from getting hungry again five minutes into studying.
–A handful of berries. Berries are full of antioxidants and vitamins that help increase blood flow which can improve mental performance.
–String cheese. A stick of cheese can provide you with a bit of calcium and protein. It’s easy to grab on your way out or easy to pick up in the bookstore and only comes in around 60 calories.

Light Prep snacks:
–Veggies and hummus. With everyone in hectic study modes, we may forget to consume essential healthy foods, especially our vegetables. Dipping some carrots, cucumbers, peppers, etc. in a bit of hummus will give you both a bit of energy and protein to keep you focused.
–Greek Yogurt Parfait. Greek yogurt has a ton of probiotics, calcium, and protein which help to curb hunger. Paired with your favorite fruit and low-fat granola, you’ll get an extra energy boost. Parfaits can be found around campus in places like Seeds, but they can be a bit pricey and some may be a bit high in calories.
–Apples with almond butter. This mix of vitamins, potassium, fiber, and protein will fill you up and give you studying stamina. Peanut butter is an easy alternative, but it usually contains more sugar, fat, and salt.

Drinks:
–Water. Water is one of the simplest yet most important parts of our diet. A glass of water can help improve circulation, reduce headaches, keep us from overheating, and keep us hydrated for the long haul at Leavey.
–Green Tea. While most students can be seen around campus with a cup of coffee in their hands at all hours, I would suggest students give this herbal tea a try. Consuming green tea has multiple health benefits, but it also gives you just a bit of caffeine and won’t make you as jittery as coffee will.
–Coffee. If you cannot give up your caffeine, try ordering a skinny latte or a non-fat cappuccino at Trojan Grounds instead of your usual Venti White Chocolate Mocha. A bit of caffeine may be essential to keeping you focused in the early morning hours at Leavey after spending the night, but added sugar and fat is not necessary nor beneficial to your already stressed body.
If you’ve got the time or want to be distracted from studying, feel free to test out some new studying snacks. Here’s a list of some great foods that will help get you through the week but might take longer to prep!
Good luck with your midterms and smart snacking!
