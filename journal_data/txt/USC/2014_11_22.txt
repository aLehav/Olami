The Victory Bell rang loud and often on Saturday night, as USC lost its third straight game to its crosstown rival UCLA Bruins and ended its Pac-12 title aspirations this season.
The Bruins (9-2, 6-2 Pac-12) sacked redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler six times en route to their 38-20 win over the Trojans (7-4, 6-3) at the Rose Bowl. USC’s young offensive linemen appeared completely incapable of protecting Kessler, who finished the game with 214 yards and one touchdown and one interception.
“It’s hard to get through progressions when guys are in the backfield,” Kessler said. “I tried to make some plays on the run and make some stuff happen, but they did a good job all around.”
While Kessler and the Trojans struggled with execution, UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley threw for 326 yards and three touchdowns and became UCLA’s all-time leader in total offense.
Hundley made one early mistake, but ran the offense efficiently from there on out. On UCLA’s second offensive play of the game, Hundley forced a pass into tight coverage, and USC redshirt junior linebacker Anthony Sarao picked it off and ran in back for a 17-yard touchdown to give USC its only lead of the game.
After stalling on the ensuing drive, UCLA punted to Agholor, who fumbled the ball and allowed to Bruins to take over on the 8-yardline. UCLA made good on its nation’s-best 97.4 percent conversion rate in the red zone, and evened the score at 7-7. Agholor’s mistake shifted the momentum back toward the Bruins, and they never looked back.
Agholor, who was recently named a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, severely disappointed after posting two straight games with more than 200 receiving yards. The Tampa, Florida, native dropped one potential touchdown and finished the game with just 24 yards on three catches.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian noted that the offense couldn’t execute when Kessler forced it to Agholor.
“Sometimes when you throw the ball so much to one guy — not necessarily out of design, but that’s what happened the last couple weeks — you can potentially fall into a little trap of ‘That’s where it should always go,’” Sarkisian said. “We’ve got other really good players. We’re at our best when the ball is getting deployed to a variety of people.”
The Trojans went into halftime down 24-14 following a rushing touchdown by sophomore tailback Justin Davis and three Hundley touchdowns to Devin Lucien, Thomas Duarte and Eldridge Massington, but the floodgates opened as soon as the second half began. The Bruins drove 84 yards down the field, capped off by a 10-yard touchdown run by Paul Perkins, who surpassed USC redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen for the most rushing yards in the Pac-12 this year.
Allen, who averaged 118.4 yards per game coming into the matchup, finished with just 60 yards behind the shaky offensive line.
Redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Zach Banner, who started at right tackle, felt his individual effort could have changed the course of the game.
“I feel like I let my team down,” Banner said. “But like Coach [Sarkisian] said, people make mistakes. Everybody’s gonna have mistakes. I just expect myself to be perfect.”
The Trojans were far from perfect, though, converting just eight of 17 attempts on third down. UCLA wasn’t much better on third down, going just nine-for-16, but still looked dominant on both sides of the ball. Hundley, who has been hailed for his dual-threat capabilities, scampered into the end zone midway through the third quarter to give UCLA its biggest lead of the game, at 38-14.
Despite being down by 24, Sarkisian said his team never let up.
“I will say this: I am proud of our guys — their effort, their willingness to compete late in the game and battle,” Sarkisian said. “They came right together as a team, which is a hard thing to do through disappointment, through adversity, but again I’ve been praising these guys for that all along.”
The Trojans demonstrated their resolve late in the game by stringing together their longest drive: a 15-play, 91-yard sequence that resulted in an Allen rushing touchdown. But it was a thankless score, as a failed two-point conversion made it an 18-point game.
Though it was a crushing defeat for the Trojans, Sarkisian insists the team will bounce back for its final home game of the season.
“We’re not dead,” Sarkisian said. “We lost a football game.”
Teams like individuals will play as they practice;obviously ucla blocks and tackles in practice much harder and with more intensity;that is why SC was dominated on the line and in the secondary;you can’t practice soft and expect to play hard;finesse rarely wins at the line of scrimmage.
EMBARRASSING…Complete domination by a better prepared and more physical Ucla team. O-line didn’t give Kessler time to find open receivers or create hole for the running backs. The defense forgot how to tackle, the safety left open the middle of the field and corners didn’t shed blockers to make tackles on bubble screens. No halftime adjustments. I think you have to look at the quality of the coaching.
3peat loss to the Bruins.  Trojans suck balls
So they have a willingness to compete but…?  Lack the propper coaching.  We know there is plenty of talent on the field.

They didn’t start the fire. Seriously.
In the height of rivalry week between USC-UCLA, the Bruins forfeited a long-held tradition in protest of the state’s proposal to hike up tradition prices in the University of California system. Around 50 student protesters surrounded the woodpile that would have been used for the fire, which led UCLA officials to cancel the bonfire.
UCLA football coach Jim Mora announced the bonfire cancellation, saying it was because of “circumstances beyond our control,” according to the Daily Bruin. 
Those at UCLA weren’t the only ones to hold protests. UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco students also held demonstrations.
The fact that students halted one of their traditions over a debate in tuition should signal they mean business. UCLA, like USC, loves its sports.
The annual cross-town rivalry has nurtured the perennial pregame traditions between both schools. Here at USC we have Conquest, a music festival and celebration of athletic teams that draws out 6,000 to 7,000 students, according to USC Program Board. The event also includes a Ferris wheel and bonfire where a UCLA bruin is burned.
In the same vein, UCLA holds a bonfire rally to get the rivalry juices flowing. About 4,000 to 5,000 students attend the event.
Yet, the 14-7 vote on Thursday from the Board of Regents to increase tuition prices, possibly by 28 percent by 2019, calmed the flames. This vote came in the wake of the UC system receiving less funding from the state. According to TIME, tuition in the UC system has tripled. Ten schools make up the UC system, accounting for about 224,279 students, according to the University of California website.
On Friday, UC President Janet Napolitano said school officials had no choice but to propose annual tuition increases of up to 5 percent over five years. It is important to note that more than half of all UC students pay no tuition because their costs are covered by public and private grants based on income.
Yet, student’s voices should still be taken into account. Protesting students, however, will not be received well if they continue to halt annual traditions. This will only cause an uphill battle. When it comes to student protests, those done at sports-related events oftentimes get pushed to the sidelines and forgotten as soon as the game starts. Certainly, that would have been the case at USC.
Students must go directly to the decision makers. They must be seen by school administrators –– not just other students. Protesting at a sports rally will not affect the Board of Regents. It only serves to dampen school spirits a bit more.
In terms of sports, flagging school spirit among the Bruins is good for the Trojans on game day (Fight On!). But speaking as a college student who is color-blind to both cardinal and gold or gold and blue, I strongly believe encouraging other students to join the movement and not spurn it because it has disrupted school tradition is the most effective way to mobilize against recent tuition decision.
And in this way, this USC student stands with UCLA (but never in football).
The USC-UCLA game kicks off at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl.
