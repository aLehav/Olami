It’s been five years since Ontario electro-pop duo Junior Boys dropped the ridiculously infectious single “In The Morning” as a free download on iTunes, but what do Jeremy Greenspan and Matt Didemus have to show for the time? One full-length (2009’s Begone Dull Care), a few remix-heavy EPs and the harder-to-quantify experience that comes with half a decade of flirting with the edges of the electronic community.

This week the pair released something markedly more tangible: a fourth studio album, It’s All True. The record’s nine succinct, delightful tracks weave together all the best lessons of Greenspan’s 12-year recording career into an hour of accessible dance music that allows Junior Boys to approach a broader and more diverse dance-pop audience.
In only 50 minutes, Junior Boys offer a narrative that starts simply and ascends to a soaring conclusion. Several songs are catchy club tunes (“Second Chance” and “Kick the Can”), while others offer surprising lyrical cleverness (“The Reservoir” and “ep”).
The record’s first two tracks, “Itchy Fingers” and “Playtime,” are unremarkable. Although the unapologetically synthetic instrumentals are just intriguing enough to carry the tracks, they’re far better suited to an ambient party playlist than electronic dance set. The album finally begins to impress on its third track, “You’ll Improve Me.” In five seconds, the song asserts itself as a verifiable head-bobber, and by the one-minute mark it evolves enough to maintain the listener’s undivided attentions.
Junior Boys complement this stellar introduction with three solid songs, the mellow “A Truly Happy Ending,” melancholy “The Reservoir” and perfectly constructed “Second Chance” (likely the album’s best). “Ending” combines delightful ambience with unexpectedly sad lyrics. It and “Reservoir,” the arty, airy follow-up, will make few club appearances this fall. Though thoughtful and intriguing, they’re perhaps a little heavy for their delight-filled background noise.
Then comes “Second Chance,” a five-minute exercise in perfectly executed dance sound. Its instrumental line is the least obtrusive of any of the record’s offerings up to that point, complementing It’s All True’s most complex and soaring vocals.
The final three songs build on this solid middle section. “Kick the Can” is similarly synthetic but difficult to follow, telling its five-minute tale in beeps and short sonic lines that begin to stir a rave’s intensity into the relaxation the listener expects. After a few minutes’ heaviness, however, “Can” reverts to Junior Boys’ characteristic chill. It fades into “ep,” the penultimate track, which features the album’s best sing-a-long possibilities.
Finally, It’s All True concludes with the nine-minute epic “Banana Ripple.” Junior Boys truly saved their best work for last: “Ripple” is positively infectious, showcasing both the band’s best writing and sound construction. Complex and crafty, this song reflects the intricate studio efforts of musicians who like experimentation.
This album is, occasionally, too involved. It twists often enough to threaten jarring, but the melodies are smooth enough to unite each distinct chapter. More importantly, each song is inventive and enjoyable enough to play independently. On It’s All True, Junior Boys offer the energy of that first free single that captivated casual listeners and mix it delightfully with five more years of technical prowess.
If you don’t really want it / Just try some, the hook of “Banana Ripple” challenges — and that is precisely Junior Boys’ invitation to unsure electronic listeners. It’s All True is a perfect introduction for new fans and a playful addition for seasoned ones. In their fourth full-length album from twelve years of recording, the Junior Boys have found a gleeful artistic niche that is simultaneously pop-friendly and entirely danceable.

Now in its 41st year, there’s no arguing that L.A. Pride is solidly over the hill.

From its pointedly political origins in May 1970 (the first annual parade was conceived as a West Coast commemoration of the one-year anniversary of the infamous police brutality in New York that came to be known at the Stonewall Riots), the parade and accompanying festival now represents one of the most consistent economic boons for the city of West Hollywood and is among the largest gay pride events in the country.
For the first time in the history of L.A. Pride, a “Purple Party” celebrating women kicked off the weekend-spanning celebration. Billed as an “homage to the ‘L’ of LGBT,” the event featured guest DJ sets by leading female DJs as well as an appearance by castmembers of Showtime’s The Real L Word and a performance by R&B’s preeminent grandmaster of rasp, Macy Gray.
Sunday’s parade along Santa Monica Boulevard started at 11 a.m. with U.S. Olympian-turned-reality-TV-star Johnny Weir serving as Grand Marshal. The figure skater first caught the nation’s attention for his bejeweled skin-tight get-ups — flamboyant even by competition skating’s standards — and his controversial fur advocacy. His show Be Good Johnny Weir on the Sundance Channel showcases Weir’s myriad side-projects — designing clothes, recording music and more — but his perch on the parade’s Grand Marshal float undoubtedly served as his introduction to a great many of those in attendance.
In keeping with the far-reaching trend of the commercialization of L.A. Pride, easily half of those marching in the parade represented some form of business or corporation. Media conglomerates (NBCUniversal, for instance), international retailers (Macy’s) and even grocers (Albertsons) had rainbow-clad representatives marching in the parade. Businesses eager to emphasize their pro-gay stances also had plenty of representation in the festival compound itself in the form of fully staffed booths, replete with promotional giveaways and prizes.

Appearances within the festival grounds by Raja Gemini and Manila Luzon, the winner and first runner-up of the most recent season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, sparked the formation of an hour-long line at the Logo booth that never truly abated — others were simply prevented from getting in line once a cut-off was announced. Raja and Manila signed photos and posed for photos, though near the end of the meet-and-greet engagement, Manila apparently couldn’t be troubled to stop eating kettle corn for a photo op.
Although not the last performer of the night, British pop artist Estelle was the headliner for Sunday’s Pride Festival events. After opening with a nearly stock-still rendition of “Freak,” Estelle continued performing as if contained within a glass box that no one else could see. A run-through of “American Boy” showed that the song doesn’t need Kanye to get crowds worked up, but it was “One Love” that marked the audience’s clear favorite.
Perhaps the most exciting news emerging from L.A. Pride in the realm of music — for the USC community, at least — was the unprecedented appearance of USC musicians performing with the Lamdba LGBT Association in Sunday’s Parade. The association’s usual refrains of “We are ’SC” and the SoCal spellout were supplemented by musical accompaniment, marking the beginning of what’s sure to become an annual tradition.

Last weekend, action movie buffs, pop culture addicts and comic book fans alike gathered at the Chinese 6 Theater in Hollywood for the second annual Los Angeles Times Hero Complex Film Festival. The four-day celebration featured screenings of Star Trek, Superman, Iron Man and their sequels, but appearances by some of the creative minds behind the movies were inarguably the festival’s primary draw.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The festival, a production of the Los Angeles Times’ superhero- and fantasy-centric “Hero Complex” blog, kicked off on Thursday with a special screening of Dick Tracy, followed by a discussion with Warren Beatty, the 1990 film’s illustrious producer, director and star. Friday’s double feature included Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan along with J.J. Abrams’ 2009 reboot Star Trek, complete with a presentation by screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, as well as producer Damon Lindlof. On Saturday, Superman and the rarely seen Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut were screened to a packed house, followed by a panel by director Richard Donner.
Saturday also boasted a guest appearance by Geoff Johns, chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, and Jim Lee, co-publisher of DC Comics. Sunday’s double event began with an exclusive matinee of The Incredibles with supervising animator Dave Mullins. The festival wrapped up Sunday evening with a double feature of Iron Man and Iron Man II, with an appearance by director and producer Jon Favreau.
With so many high-profile names and classic action movies squeezed into one weekend, few in attendance probably left the film festival feeling as if they didn’t get their money’s worth — tickets ranged from $30 to $45 per event, including single screenings and double features. For each event, the Chinese 6 decorated the lobby as a tribute to the day’s films.
On Saturday, the Chinese 6 showcased a special homage to actor Christopher Reeve, complete with a full-sized statue of the late actor in his prime, in the lobby of the historic theater.
After the first movie, guests were treated to a rousing discussion with director Richard Donner, including on-set anecdotes in which Donner felt the need to name-drop Marlon Brando, Christopher Reeve and writer Tom Mankiewicz.
In addition, several audience members were allowed to ask questions of the director after host and Times writer Geoff Boucher finished his interview, addressing anything from Donner’s hopes for the future of the Man of Steel to his experiences while filming Maverick in 1994. Donner spoke fondly of the making of both Superman movies and was enthusiastic about continuing the hero’s legacy into the 21st century.
In addition to the panel by Richard Donner, Geoff Johns of DC Enterprises and Jim Lee of DC Comics spoke about the future of the Superman franchise on Saturday. The pair unveiled the planned republication of the Superman comics, starting with Action Comics No. 1 and featuring a new, contemporary interpretation of the Man of Steel. Lee made light of the new image, revealing Superman will get a more streamlined costume in DC Comics and will even appear wearing jeans in several Action Comic issues.
Though these new publications will be more modern in appearance, both Johns and Lee reassured audience members that key moments of Superman’s life will be preserved. This reinvention seems only fitting for the 73rd anniversary of one of America’s most classic icons.
Following the comic experts’ panel, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was shown to a star-struck audience, and the next two hours held only the sounds of popcorn crunching and John William’s epic soundtrack. The second movie proved to be as enthralling as the first, and guests left the theater long after midnight.
With such mesmerizing possibilities, the Hero Complex Film Festival will undoubtedly become a staple in summertime film screenings.
Four new superhero movies are slated to release in the next few months, including a number of comic book adaptations, ensuring future festivals will certainly have enough material.

Jim Haw, professor of chemistry and environmental sciences, will tell you not all the best research is done at a lab. In fact, some of the most important research can be done underwater.

Haw and lecturer David Ginsburg led 24 USC students on a Problems Without Passports program this summer, conducting research on coral reefs and ocean environments from May 16 until June 4.
The program was started last year with 14 students because of a lack of scuba regulators and buoyancy compensators, as well as safety and practicality issues.
This year, the number of participants almost doubled after more equipment became available and interest grew.
After enrolling in a four-unit course, part of the Maymester program, students spent one week at Catalina Island’s USC Wrigley Marine Science Center, one week in Guam and one week in Palau.
The cost of the program was included with the spring semester’s tuition, but most students received $2,500 in a summer undergraduate research fund scholarship toward travel expenses for participation in the program.
“The course prepares students to participate in a real scientific expedition where they perform scientific measurements underwater in remote, exotic and threatened marine coastal environments,” Haw said. “It is a very ambitious goal.”
Participants enrolled in the program either through a personal invitation or by showing interest and submitting an application.
“I heard about it in my ENST 100  [Introduction to Environmental Studies] class when Dr. Haw came to tell us about it” said Kirstie Jones, a junior majoring in environmental studies and who participated in the program. “I was immediately attracted to it because I thought it would be a really unique thing not only to travel to those places but also to learn how to scuba dive.”
Though students began their research at the time of their travel, training for the trip began in the first week of the spring semester. Students began doing routine pool sessions in March and spent most of their weekends in April at Catalina Island.
During the actual travel, each day consisted of various lectures and recreational activities including hiking, meeting endangered species, kayaking, snorkeling and diving. Dives were often monitored by Gerry Smith, USC dive safety officer, and Tom Carr, a USC hyperbaric chamber volunteer, experienced scuba instructor and a reserve captain in the Riverside County sheriff’s office.
“Most of the dives on Palau contributed data sets to a government conservation program,” Haw said. “Those dives were made on reefs that no one, and I mean no one, is allowed on for any purpose [other than for] permitted research activities only.”
Underwater research consisted of transecting — observing, recording and determining change in the ocean’s environment through a given path. Students also surveyed Micronesia’s biodiversity and encountered World War II debris and sharks along the way.
“I learned the basics of research diving such as learning how to use transect lines, underwater slates, and quadrants to count and survey invertebrates and substrate,” Jones said. “I also learned that coral reefs in Guam are threatened by a military buildup that would involve dredging 70 acres of coral to make way for a U.S. aircraft carrier.”
Last year’s participants were required to keep an online blog of their experiences through USC. This spring, Scientific American expressed interest in student’s experiences and picked up on their posts.
Emilie Moore, a senior majoring in environmental studies, who also participated in the program, recalls her most memorable experience during her group’s last dive on Palau’s famous Ulong channel.
“We swam with great reef sharks, sea turtles and manta rays while drifting over 200-year-old coral formations,” she said. “I plan to directly use the experiences from this trip in my summer work with a Venice-based marine consulting group.”
According to Haw, almost all of the students who participated this summer now have complete American Academy of Underwater Sciences Scientific Diver certifications. They are all also being issued at least two recreational diving cards.
“We are all like a family after our experiences,” Moore said.

Promising transformative steps in research, teaching and patient care, USC announced a $150-million donation from the W. M. Keck Foundation to its medical enterprise Monday — a gift university officials said would have a deep impact on the USC medical community moving forward.
Build up · After a $150-million donation from the W. M. Keck Foundation, the Keck School of Medicine will be integrated into the new Keck Medicine of USC brand. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
“This $150-million gift from the Keck Foundation will have a profound impact on our community and our world, today and for generations to come. It will be a catalyst for dramatic discoveries and developments in medical research, teaching and patient care,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement released early Monday formally announcing the gift.
According to James Ukropina, vice president of the Keck Foundation, Nikias presented the foundation with a proposal for a donation of this magnitude in December 2010, a “real trigger” behind the gift.
The donation, which is to be distributed during the next 20 years, will be directed toward the recruitment of faculty in specific fields of study USC sees as on the verge of taking an important step forward, according to officials.
“The best way to grow our research portfolio is to recruit outstanding and transformative scientists from other universities and medical schools,” said Edward Crandall, chairman of the department of medicine at USC. “This gift will make it possible for us to reach further than we already do.”
Crandall sees the areas of stem cell and regenerative medicine, cancer research, neuroscience research and advances in the study of liver, pulmonary, kidney and cardiovascular diseases as among the fields where USC can continue to make the biggest strides.
As part of the largest donation in the history of the Keck Foundation, the entirety of the medical enterprise system at USC will be renamed as Keck Medicine of USC.
That enterprise has grown significantly in the past two years after USC purchased the Norris Cancer Hospital and the USC University Hospital in 2009 from Tenet Healthcare Corp., behind a strong push from Nikias, who was executive vice president and provost at the time.
The purchase of the hospitals allowed for greater collaboration between the medical school and patient care, and the university has worked to create a dynamic relationship between the two entities. School officials hope the gift will stimulate a greater interplay between the medical school and the academic medical center as well as foster growth and a relationship the Keck Foundation recognized as a commitment to medicine.
“The purchase of the hospitals signaled to us a serious commitment to medical care, both to expand and increase [advances in the medical field],”  Ukropina said.
The renamed Keck Hospital of USC, Keck Doctors of USC and the USC Norris Cancer Hospital will make up the Keck Medical Center of USC and will join the Keck School of Medicine under the umbrella brand.
This gift follows a $110-million donation the foundation made in 1999 to the medical school, which was renamed the Keck School of Medicine. The relationship between the Keck Foundation, which aims to back scientific progress, and USC has continued to be important.
“This gift reflects our commitment to bringing cutting-edge science, medicine and engineering together to find new and better ways forward,” Robert Day, CEO of the Keck Foundation said in the statement.
The donation’s impact on the medical school was especially important to the Keck Foundation as well as school officials.
“A great university needs a great medical school,” Crandall said. “USC’s investment in purchasing the hospitals and this Keck gift will both be tremendously important in enabling us to climb to the top of the rankings among medical schools.”
This gift marks another in a run of large donations the university has received in the time since Nikias’ inauguration in October 2010, which includes Julie and John Mork’s $110-million scholarship fund donation and Dana and David Dornsife’s $200-million donation to the renamed Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences .
[…] “This $ 150 million gift from the Keck Foundation will have a profound impact on our community and our world, today and for generations to come.

Summer Trojan: Congratulations on being drafted by the San Francisco Giants. What do you know about the organization?
Oropesa: I’ve been hearing really good stuff about them. Obviously they won the World Series, so they know what they’re doing. I’ve been looking at the system. It seems like they have one real standout first baseman, but, other than that, no one I’ll really have to compete with.
Slugger · USC first baseman Ricky Oropesa finished his USC career with 40 home runs and 159 RBI. Both marks place him fifth all-time in Trojan history. Oropesa was also a two-time All-Pac-10 selection. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information 
 
ST: What was your initial reaction [to being drafted]?
Oropesa: Well, going in [to the draft], I thought I’d go in the first day [rounds one and two], so I was a little disappointed that I didn’t. But obviously I was happy. I was just happy to have it over.
 
ST: What are the Giants’ plans for your immediate future?
Oropesa: Mike Kendall is the L.A. area scout for the Giants. He’s the one who called me, actually, to tell me they had picked me. I’m going to meet with him the next few weeks to play it all out. But he said they were very excited to have me. He told me they were really surprised I was still there [at 116th overall], so everyone in the draft room was very happy that they could get me. And that’s really good to hear, that an organization really wants to have you.
 
ST: People say the biggest difference between the professional and college games is wooden vs. metal bats. How do you feel about transitioning to wooden bats?
Oropesa: I’m really excited to use wood. I actually like it better than metal. It’s just more natural. I learned how to hit with wood. I’ve hit with wood in a whole bunch of summer leagues. I’m just excited to go back and find my stroke with it.
 
ST: Apart from the bats, what do you expect to be the biggest challenge for you transitioning to the pros?
Oropesa: I think the competition. Everyone is fighting for a job. Everyone’s trying to beat not just the other team, but everyone else. But I’m looking forward to it. It’s going to be fun, you know. I expect to face some adversity. And then there’s just the daily grind. It’s baseball, but it’s still a job. It’s going to be a tough challenge.
 
ST: Moving back to USC, what do you think of the direction the program is headed?
Oropesa: This year’s team was definitely a step in the right direction in terms of bringing back the tradition of excellence at USC. The coaching staff did a great job of motivating us, and we exceeded a lot of expectations this year. Not our own expectations, I think [the team] was always confident. But outside … I mean we were picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10, so we exceeded others’ expectations for sure.
 
ST: What has USC meant to you?
Oropesa: USC has been great to me. They have given me so many opportunities, opened so many doors for me. Even outside of baseball. They’ve gotten me really close to a degree. And I am going to go back and get it come fall. I promised my parents.
“I’ve been looking at the system. It seems like they have one real standout first baseman, but, other than that, no one I’ll really have to compete with.” 
Love his confidence and his acknowledgment that he will face good competition, but perhaps he can be a little more modest on the outside in order to avoid friction with his new teammates.
Hey Steve B., bitter much?  So you’re seriously suggesting that Oropesa should give up all his bargaining leverage and a guaranteed pro contract sure to be above $300K to return for his senior year?  Not only do college seniors rarely get drafted in the first round (please name me one college senior that has been drafted in the first 2 rounds in the past 10 years), but they end up putting themselves behind nearly everybody in their draft class by delaying the start of their pro career by 1 year.  And what happens if he gets injured in the next 11 months?  The risk/reward just doesn’t add up for Ricky.  I could possibly see the temptation for Ricky if he had been drafted in the 10th round (or later), or if the Trojans were going to have a realistic shot at making the College World Series next year, but we both know that’s not happening.
It looks like he is determined to turn pro which doesn’t help the team for next year. He could improve his defense and regain his power stroke and move up to the 1st round in the draft by returning to school for his senior year. Hope he remembers the last two games of the season at home getting squashed by a mediocre Washington St. team being out scored 23 to 3 costing the Trojans fourth place in the conference.

Heritage Hall, by most standards, is a decorated facility. Six Heisman trophies line the entrance, championship banners hang from the upper balcony, and if you venture outside the building, you’ll spot several hundred plaques on a patio floor commemorating members of USC’s athletic hall of fame. It’s a fitting display for a program with 92 national championships — 11 on the gridiron.
Still, it goes without saying that, despite the pedigree, despite a remarkable run of success even in recent seasons, that USC, at least football-wise, is in a slump.
Over the last 12 months, its football program was placed on four-years’ probation, sued by the Tennessee Titans, sued by Stafon Johnson, posted its worst overall record since 2001, its defense allowed more yards per game than any other USC defense in 45 years and then its appeal of the original sanctions was denied.
Oh, and in case you missed it, the 2004 national championship-winning season never happened.
But this shouldn’t be about what transpired. After all, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden recently said USC has “moved on.”
But it’s hard.
And the thing is, I know how I want to feel about this. I don’t want to talk about it. I want to talk about Matt Barkley as a Heisman Trophy candidate. I want to talk about Devon Kennard returning to defensive end. I want to talk about a 30-member incoming recruiting class.
But I know how I should feel about this: The bad press isn’t over and that can’t be ignored. You’re going to keep reading about the NCAA. You’re going to keep hearing about the Committee on Infractions. You’re going to keep noticing lingering effects. The storm clouds looming over Heritage Hall are not going to part overnight.
Thank the University of Tennessee and Todd McNair for that.
Last Saturday, USC coach Lane Kiffin, who formerly served as the Tennessee headman for 14 months, met with the COI in Indianapolis after being served with a notice of allegations in late February concerning his stay, albeit a brief one, in Knoxville, Tenn.
Accordingly, Kiffin was cited for a failure to promote an atmosphere for compliance, as well as a failure to monitor — both of which remain major violations according to the NCAA.
The problem hinges on one thing: it could still impact USC even while the alleged infractions occurred on Eastern Standard Time. There’s precedent for that.
Rick Neueheisel, while serving as the coach at Colorado from 1995-1998, was found guilty of multiple recruiting violations in 2002 and, subsequently, was barred from off-campus recruiting as Washington’s coach for seven months.
Similarly, in 2006, the NCAA banned Indiana basketball coach Kelvin Sampson from calling recruits and making off-campus visits for a year after he and his staff violated NCAA rules by making 577 additional phone calls to various prospects while at Oklahoma.
Such a circumstance would unquestionably hamper USC, which is already facing scholarship restrictions, on the recruiting trail, but even more damaging to the program’s reputation as a whole remains, yes, another lawsuit.
Former running backs coach Todd McNair, who was presumed by the NCAA to know of former tailback Reggie Bush’s dealings with sports marketers Lloyd Lake and Michael Michaels during the 2004 and 2005 seasons, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month against the NCAA, alleging libel, slander and negligence.
McNair’s suit isn’t particularly relevant in regard to USC on the field at least. He’s seeking monetary gains after the NCAA gave him a show-cause penalty last June, preventing him from recruiting and forcing schools to “show-cause” if they wish to hire him. Both make him essentially unemployable.
But McNair’s lawsuit, provided it does go to trial, could impact USC by making things public. In case there isn’t a settlement, which still remains quite possible, the NCAA would have the power to subpoena witnesses in court. Pete Carroll could testify. Brennan Carroll could testify. Reggie Bush could testify.
For a group that largely pleaded ignorance, denied any sort of knowledge of “extra benefits,” it might choose to paint a different story if speaking under oath.
What did they know? When did they know it? What else did they know?
It’s been speculated, for some time and for good reason, that there were infractions committed by other USC players and coaches that were not included in the NCAA’s report last June. Those could be revealed. Those could become public. Those could become very damaging, PR-wise for a university trying to cast an image of itself as the leader in 21st-century compliance.
It could still drag on.
Nobody wants to be called into court. Nobody wants to say anything. Nobody, McNair aside, wants to write another chapter to this never ending saga. Bush chose to settle with Lake and New Era Sports & Entertainment in 2007 for $300,000 as opposed to making a court-ordered deposition. Think he’s itching to testify?
It’s been roughly seven years since Bush raced down the Coliseum sidelines, adorned in a cardinal-clad No. 5 jersey. That’s more than 80 months, more than 3,000 days.
“If only we could just move on.”
 
“The 19th Hole” runs every other Wednesday. To comment on this article, email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
USC haters are a desperate pathetic crowd of losers. they believe anything and everything negative about USC…as long as it makes them feel better about how their pathetic little wannabe program got demolished by USC on the field. Sad.
It amazes me each time I see comments by these people who apparently don’t know much about USC. You only call USC “cheaters” because of your dislike for them after they have pounded your schools into the ground on the field. For your info, it was a player who violated the rules, not the coaches. TO THIS VERY DAY, the NCAA has NO EVIDENCE that the coaching staff knew of the player’s involvement with the agent. The NCAA, which has lost so much credibility over their unethical judgments and rule changing based on USC’s case, chose as “evidence” to believe the statement of an agent who knowingly knew his involvement with the player was a violation (thus, no credibility). The NCAA chose to believe a “rule breaking” uncredible agent rather than the USC coaching staff.  The bottom line, the NCAA never had evidence that the coaching staff knew of the player breaking rules. One player violated the rules…NOT the coaches…NOT USC. When a program is successful, like USC is, there are always critics who want to try and knock USC. Critics including some of these morons writing these comments and the morons that work for the NCAA…You can try to knock USC all you want, but USC will always be USC and will always continue to fight on.
And as for the writer of this article…I completely disagree with you. How can you say, “Thanks to Todd McNair” for a dark cloud? Actually, if you are a Trojan fan (which probably your not), you should be praising Coach McNair. Good for Coach McNair…Its about time someone stand up to the morons of the NCAA and expose them of “Cheating.”
my mommy said cheaters never prosper. too bad i was affiliated with this place.
what a ridiculous comment…you were affiliated with that great place and yet obviously don’t have a clue about the NCAA’s judgements and findings (or I should say lack of). Apparently, you don’t know much about USC either.
We may say that there are dark clouds over USC, and we could blame all these students and administrators, but if you understand the big picture, you would see that these clouds are spewing from the NCAA, and they hover over many other schools too. The justice department is investigating the NCAA because enough people have been crying out that their systems are not congruent, whether it be in penalizing schools or deciding championships. 
The whole NCAA is flawed to begin with, even a recent Southpark episode brought up the comparisons to that organization and slavery. A valid point, considering the NCAA helps schools exploit their athletes for minimal pay, despite the revenue they help generate in merchandise sales. These athletes basically do enough training and practices time-wise to qualify as a full time job, and they are expected to be in class, when they are tired and sore.
 The athletes know they are being used, they know others are profiting on their work, they know that they could get a career ending injury at any moment, and they know that the NCAA wags their finger at them for taking money, while the other NCAA hand slides a wad of bills into their pocket with every “penalty”. If the NCAA seems to act unfairly to the athletes, then the athletes seem to learn that the image of propriety is more important than actual being fair and honest. In other words, athletes learn to appear saintly, but to try not to get caught. 
Until the NCAA gets regulated, decapitated or another organization rises to replace it, there will be more exploitation of athletes, and thus more willfull rebellious athlete defiance of the rules in such a flawed system. Some may say that it is unseemly to pay athletes, since they are paid in education, but much of this education is saddled with expensive book fees, parking cost, and other unforseen charges that plague many students and aren’t considered when creating scholarship amounts. 
Plus, the university model of education was founded by the ancient Greeks, who were only allowed the time to earn their education because slaves tended to the work that would have otherwise occupied their time. Maybe the leaders of the NCAA think that this tradition must continue, and it is their mandate to invoke it in present days, but hopefully our new leaders will make the enlightened decisions and change the system for the better. 
We all need to realize that these dark clouds over USC and other schools are really noxious plumes from the dark spire of the NCAA, and if we don’t knock down this tower, it will be our fault when their dark matter obscures our vision, steals our sunshine, dirties our reputation and fouls the noble experience of sports. 
Something to think about…
USC brought this on themselves by being a serial (six time) NCAA violator. The more grief and embarrassment USC receives the more I like it. USC deserves any and every thing they get.
Another ridiculous comment! You like some of the other USC haters don’t have a clue. To this day, the NCAA don’t have evidence of the coaching staff violating rules. They believed an uncredible agent who knowingly helped one player violate rules.
Keep trying to knock USC all you want, but USC will continue to fight on.

The look on Martin Trainer’s face said it all.
The USC sophomore had just learned, by virtue of his 2011 Pac-10 individual championship won in early May, that he had received an exemption to play in the PGA Tour’s Reno Tahoe Open, achieving a lifelong goal of teeing it up at the sport’s highest level.
“It’s everyone’s dream,” Trainer said. “Every kid wants to play on the PGA Tour.”

It’s a dream that is becoming an increasing reality for USC golfers of the present and recent past.
Jamie Lovemark, who played three seasons for the Trojans from 2006 to 2009 and won the 2007 NCAA individual title, is playing full time on the PGA Tour this season.
Matt Giles and Tim Sluiter, who played with Lovemark on the 2008 USC team that finished two strokes shy of a national championship, are on the Nationwide and PGA European tours, respectively, both of which are a step below the PGA Tour.
Incoming freshman Anthony Paolucci, ranked the No. 1 high school golfer in the nation, has played in two PGA Tour events this season (including a tie for 29th at the Farmers Insurance Open in La Jolla, Calif., in January) before even beginning his college career.
“A really strong recruiting tool will be having guys on the tour,” USC coach Chris Zambri said.
Trainer said USC’s ability to prepare players for professional golf was one of the school’s top selling points.
“That was a huge factor,” Trainer said. “When was I was a senior in high school looking at all of the schools, Jamie Lovemark was one of the guys at USC, and he was probably the biggest name in college golf. Recently, there’s been an exceptional amount of talent that has come out of there and so that did factor into my decision.”
It starts with Zambri, who played six years on the Nationwide Tour — golf’s version of baseball’s triple-A — and qualified for two U.S. Opens during his professional career.
“It’s something I did myself for over 10 years and I feel like I know what they’re going through,” Zambri said. “Ideally, though, they’ll get to places in their careers that I never got to, which is where Jamie is now — fully exempt on the PGA Tour. I still think I can relate to what it’s like.”
Zambri preaches the importance of hard work to his players. Though the team can only practice together for 20 hours each week per NCAA regulations, the players can put in additional time on their own. Trainer said he puts in 15 to 20 hours extra per week.
The work doesn’t stop when the school year ends. Current USC players have summer schedules filled with individual tournaments.
It doesn’t get any easier after graduation, as a successful college career doesn’t guarantee a PGA Tour spot. Most players attend Q-school, the annual qualifying tournament for the PGA and Nationwide tours. A finish in the top 25 and ties at the fourth and final stage earns you a fully exempt status on the next season’s PGA Tour, while the following 50 players receive Nationwide Tour cards.
Last December, Giles shot 2-under-par in the six round final stage and placed in a tie for 74th, earning his Nationwide Tour card by one stroke.
Giles has made four cuts in nine Nationwide Tour starts this year and recorded a season best tie for 19th at an April tournament in the Bay Area.
Giles, however, feels confident about his chances of joining Lovemark — who is currently out with a torn back muscle — on the top circuit next season.
“I definitely think the tools are there to get out on the PGA Tour next year,” Giles said. “I just think like everyone else, it’s a matter of putting it all together.”
Current PGA Tour players Lovemark and 2002 Pac-10 Player of the Year Kevin Stadler represent the latest Trojans in a long line of USC success at the highest level in professional golf. Four Trojan alumni — Al “Mr. 59” Geibeger, Scott Simpson, Craig “The Walrus” Stadler and Dave Stockton — have won a combined three PGA Championships, one Masters and one U.S. Open.
The current batch of Trojans would all like to someday add their names to that prestigious list.
“Every single one of us on the team is talented enough to make the [PGA] Tour,” Trainer said. “It’s the guys that will really be able to seize that opportunity and pretty much put everything else aside besides school and make sacrifices that are going to make it.”
For now, Trainer is looking forward to the Reno Tahoe Open in August and the realization of a childhood dream.
“If I do well against the pros, then that will definitely turn some heads,” Trainer said. “It’s a huge opportunity to really advance my career before it has even started.”

Despite high hopes and expectations, the USC track and field team failed to meet its set goals at the NCAA Track and Field Outdoor Championships, as the women’s team placed sixth and the men’s team placed 12th in the competition.
Winner · Senior Nia Ali won the 2011 NCAA 100-meter hurdles with a personal record of 12.63 seconds. Ali’s performance gave the Women of Troy 10 points in the team competition, which put USC in sixth place at the track and field championships. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information 
The USC women’s team finished with 30 points, after not registering any points at NCAAs last year, and walked away from the week’s events with a sense of accomplishment. Not only did it place in the top 10, but it redeemed itself.
After all, the results of last year’s NCAA competition for the Women of Troy were arguably anomalies. This was the same team that, during coach Ron Allice’s 17-season term at USC so far, had never gone scoreless at the NCAA competition.
This year’s young team, made up mostly of freshmen, came back this year and proved its worth.
“As a whole, we came off so strong,” senior Nia Ali said. “We did it basically with a team of freshman alone. I am just excited for the upcoming years. It was a big step up for freshmen and as a team as a whole.”
For the men’s team, there was a bit less to celebrate. After consistently placing in the top 10 at the NCAA competition for the last six years, the Trojans’ streak was snapped as the team only managed to earn 18 points. Despite the 12th-place finish, the team has managed to score in the top 10 in 13 of Allice’s 17 seasons heading the program.
The team’s 12th place finish was, to Allice, partially because of a lack of focus. Because most of the athletes will be returning for next season, there will be a chance for the team to redeem itself.
The individual performances at the NCAA championship by USC athletes were noteworthy. Personal records were achieved and individual titles won. Eleven different USC athletes earned first team All-America honors during the four days of events.
Hurdler and heptathlete Ali was one athlete in particular who was recognized, winning the 100-meter hurdles title at the competition with a wind-aided personal record of 12.63.
“I don’t even know what I was feeling after [the race],” Ali said. “You never know what to expect in such an unpredictable race.”
Ali also earned sixth place in the high jump.
Senior Brendan Ames performed well in the 100-meter hurdles, earning third place in the final heat. Ames finished just 0.01 seconds behind the second-place finisher with a wind-aided personal record of 13.34.
Top performances on the men’s team included senior Trey Henderson, who earned fourth place in the hammer throw, and junior Cooper Thompson, who placed ninth in javelin.
Junior Aareon Payne and freshman Jessica Davis also placed in the 200-meter, finishing in fifth and eighth place, respectively.
“I felt everyone equally contributed,” Ali said. “We had [personal records] everywhere. It wasn’t just one specific area, but obviously the sprinters and throwers played a big role.”

Eric Balderas, an illegal immigrant studying at Harvard University, faced deportation one year ago. University of Texas at Brownsville alumnus José Arturo Guerra faced deportation last month while in his last year of school. In both cases, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided not to pursue deportation.
Rather than allowing ICE to selectively prosecute undocumented students, it’s time for the United States to implement legislation to resolve the country’s problem with illegal immigration and higher education.
The Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors Act, which has been reintroduced to Congress after failing to pass in December, is not the answer. The DREAM Act would provide a pathway to certain qualified young undocumented individuals toward legal residency, and potentially citizenship, by either enlisting in the military or going to college.
Legislation like the DREAM Act encourages illegal immigration. Parents bring their children to the United States with the intention of taking advantage of the rights given to the country’s citizens and legal residents. Provisions provided by bills like the DREAM Act reward people for not following the law. Rewards aren’t usually given to those who choose to ignore laws.
An increase in illegal immigration could occur after citizens of other countries see that illegal aliens are given privileges.
Currently, 12 states, including California, allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition. In terms of aiding those students in college, this is as far as the government should go. Undocumented students should not receive state and federal aid.
According to USC’s financial aid website, international students at USC receive aid only through merit scholarships. If international students who go through legal processes to receive a student visa cannot receive federal aid, then certainly neither should people who do not go through legal channels.
Still, to extend aid to undocumented immigrant students, AB 131 has been introduced to the California Senate Education Committee. If passed, it would allow those students to become eligible for state financial aid, such as Cal Grants and University of California grants.
Like parents of other college students, the parents of undocumented immigrant students should assume the responsibility of getting their children through college. Illegal immigrant parents knew it would not be easy to live in another country without going through legal means. These are the consequences of those actions.
Even if the student graduates before being deported, he or she will face challenges in obtaining employment. They would be in a worse position than a graduated international student. Illegal immigration must stop being encouraged. Deportation needs to begin. But deporting top students, such as Balderas, might mean losing students who could benefit the United States. To solve this, illegal immigrant students could be allowed to apply for a student visa without having first to go back to his or her country of citizenship. They would be granted the same status as other international students and receive the same benefits.
Undocumented students are suffering because of the actions of their parents. But the DREAM Act, and legislation like it, is not the solution to the effects of illegal immigration on students. They should not receive state and federal aid unless it is also given to international students. They should not be rewarded for laws broken when others abide by the law. Thus, the best solution is for undocumented students to be granted student visas.

man i suck at typing.
WE all pay for the choices oof our parents, these kids need to do the same. I as a tax payer and fatehr of 3 kids do not want to pay for anything other then emergency medical for any illegal immigrant that enters our country in violation of our laws. Most are not here to be americans…most are here to work, save money, then take it back to Mexico. How do i know this you ask..because i am the son of an illegal immigrant, and i know how thinking. And no, most DONT pay taxes of any kind. Lucky for me, my mother is an American. You want to know why California is broke?…Illegal immigrants who dont pay taxes are using services of all kinds. Heck, the fact that Mexicans refuse to assimulate to american culture forces the govt to spend billions in printing everything in both english, and spanish. Everything costs money, and millions are not paying their portion. If this keeps up, the US will be broke. We need to stop spending money like we are, and part of that solution is stopping illegal immigration, and cutting off all services for illegals. Sounds terrible, but welcome to reality.
Finally a rational take on the issue. The Daily Trojan needs more of this. If you follow American laws, you will get American benefits. It is ridiculous for anyone, especially the government, to insinuate that breaking the law will result in some sort of gain for the lawbreakers. The DREAM Act is just the beginning of a slippery slope leading to an even less effective and more dangerous American immigration system, or lack thereof. Keep it up Giovanni!
Every human being has the right to freedom of movement and of residencewithin the confines of his own country; and, where there are just reasons forit, the right to emigrate to other countries and take up residence there”(Pacem in Terris, 25)
The willingness for one country to accept persons across the borders and offerthem a home is emblematic of the unity of the human family and an act of human solidarity
more significant factor in the environmental crises has been therise of consumerism and over-consumption: “In many parts of the worldsociety is given to instant gratification and consumerism while remainingindifferent to the damage which these cause. Simplicity, moderation anddiscipline, as well as a spirit of sacrifice, must become a part of everyday life,lest all suffer the negative consequences of the careless habits of a few”(Pope John Paul II, The Ecological Crisis, III.13) The Church teaches that our desire for material goods, shaped from theworld’s natural resources, should never surpass our concern for the commongood. Yet affluent nations, the chief perpetrators, have been slow to changetheir excessive consumerism.One prime example of this reluctance is the West’s continued dependence onoil. More than thirty years after the gas shortages of the 1970s, governmentleaders are still discussing incentives and strategies to move to alternativeenergy sources. Although numerous automotive technologies have beendeveloped to lower the U.S. consumption of oil, auto manufacturers and thebuying public have been slow to adapt.”
why? because it is a life style. No one wants to give up luxury for necessity
Capitalism is your culprit if you just must have one
Also keep in mind the undocumented are not in any way treated like the international students. Ask how USC makes most of it’s money. It mostly comes from the international community. They not only pay the tuition but that are the most to donate. They have that money. Some of which not even half the USC student population can afford, let alone donate
All this talk is well and good, but we are bankrupt and must cut SOMETHING. Education is the biggest expenditure in the CA budget. Reducing class sizes by asking non-citizens (legal and illegal) to pay could help reduce the cuts. Since education is truly valuable, then we should ask participants to make a down payment on their future reward.
Absolutely, which is why I’d like to see a quicker, more accessible system. Without the hope of legal immigration, these folks are going to be hiding and obviously not paying taxes (directly; they’d provide sales tax revenue regardless, I guess). I’d love to make them pay their way and contribute, but that requires an immigration system that can acknowledge immigrants and hold them accountable.  If we continue with the current policy, which is basically pursuit of deportation without a realistic path to a green card or citizenship, none of us are winning here.
If thirty to forty years ago. Individuals were allowed to enlist into the armed services
In return for a visa/ legal residency status.  Many individuals took advantage of this law…with that said . If. A student who does not have. ” A legal right / documentation ” to reside in the U .S. A. Whether it was a choice of Parents or the individual……enlisting into the armed forces. Under the college fund options , would be a small price to pay ….serving your. ” Country ” and receiving an education.  Is that not the AMERICAN DREAM.       A great article. GIOVANNI
And don’t act like legal immigration is an option. It’s not. If you think it is, then you do not understand the situation whatsoever.
While I understand the desire to not “reward” them for ignoring the law, and the desire to not encourage additional illegal immigration, illegal immigration will continue. And the kids who benefit from the DREAM Act aren’t the ones at fault for immigrating illegally. 
Education what fights back against poverty/social decay. Denying access to education worsens the problem. And it doesn’t stop illegal immigration.
I really understand where you’re coming from. I really do. But it’s just really socially shortsighted.
*education is what fights back
“Education what fights back against poverty/social decay. Denying access to education worsens the problem.”
But education costs money — and if it’s provided by a public institution, then the taxpayers are ‘footing the bill’ for it. Why should taxpayers be forced to pay for the education of those who were not welcomed here through legal channels?
Amen Giovanni, AMEN.
Oh wow. Way to pull out the stops with every reflexive argument against illegal immigration.
There are people that will be far better than I at refuting all this, but just a couple thoughts:
 — First of all, your insistence that immigrants follow the law makes a lot of sense, provided we have an immigration system that can process them in something UNDER 8 years. If this whole thing was a choice between “pay visa processing fees” and “pay a random guy thousands of dollars to smuggle you across the desert,” I bet they’d make exactly the same choice you or I might. The fact of the matter is the legal immigration that many of our ancestors enjoyed doesn’t exist today for these folks. 
— Second, the children benefiting from the DREAM act are not, in my mind, culpable. They have to have been here since age 16, which basically means they would have to have been brought here while they were kids/not adults. If these kids feel like fighting and dying for their adopted country, or getting the education to learn a skilled trade and make a better life for themselves, then they far-and-away embody that American spirit we’re so damn proud of.
I think there are other bits in here folks might have issue with, but that’s why the DREAM Act makes a lot of sense to me. At its core, if I was someone brought into another country at the risk of life and limb, if I could prove myself and live up to that country’s standards and values, I hope they would find a way to accept me.
(and then there’s all sorts of less American-exceptionalist arguments, but surely, we should be flattered)
…and I realized that the first line will probably reduce the chance of you reading the rest of the post. Ignore that, that was my own reflexiveness.
Last follow-up, I promise: I’m pretty sure the DREAM Act rewards you with a green card after your college or military time, in which case they would be in a FAR better position than our international friends. I’ve got a friend from the UK who now has to basically find work over there, because they have nowhere near the privileges that come with a full right-to-residence.

A recent Supreme Court dismissal of an appeal against a law allowing undocumented California college students to receive in-state tuition rates might nudge Gov. Jerry Brown toward signing the much-needed state DREAM Act into law.
Jovanna Tosello | Summer Trojan
The continued offering of in-state tuition rates, which has been legal for the last 10 years, is a small victory for a select group of neglected adolescents who deserve amnesty.
And while it is somewhat justifiable to blame parents for not anticipating the consequences of trying to put their undocumented children through school, we should not take away a student’s right to excel at institutions of higher learning.
According to the Los Angeles Times, an estimated 41,000 University of California, California State and community college students benefit from the law (AB 540) — less than 1 percent of total enrollment in the state. Twelve other states in the United States enforce a similar law.
An appeals group based in Washington plans on challenging the law again despite the Court’s recent dismissal.
In essence, attempts to repeal AB 540 discourage this select group of students from pursuing their dreams in a country where success is largely measured through professional and educational accomplishments. Placing their destiny out of their own control is unwarranted punishment.
To a certain extent, AB 540 significantly grants students financial rights in state education, but the DREAM Act legislation, or something similar to it, is necessary in order for undocumented students to receive benefits they’ve earned.
Legislation like the DREAM Act sets up a strict path for students who take their future seriously enough to follow a law-enforced educational or military plan toward legal residency. The bill does not grant eligibility to those who have been in California for less than five years. It requires a high school diploma and a clean background, and the student must graduate from an institution of higher education. The bill undoubtedly sets a high standard.
Some undocumented students have turned out to be the best and brightest found in the higher education system.
We cannot deny their potential by not allowing them to attend universities where those with legal residency and citizenship so often take for granted the incredible privilege of being born in the right place with the right means.
Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the state DREAM Act each time it was presented to him, beginning in 2006. While campaigning for governor, Jerry Brown promised to sign the DREAM Act if the bill ever reached his desk. 2011 might finally be that year.
California’s Senate Education Committee voted 7-3 in favor of AB 130 last week, which would make undocumented students eligible for non-state, private scholarships offered by state public schools. Soon, the committee is expected to vote on AB 131, which would make those same students eligible for state financial aid such as the Cal Grant.
Jirayut Latthi, an undocumented student and senior at UC Berkeley told Color Lines, “A lot of things are really uncertain, you don’t know what’s going to happen to your family or how things are going to work out, and you spend so much time waiting for things to happen or living in fear of deportation, so education can be this kind of light. There’s the hope that if we work hard, our education will liberate us and help us become successful because by that point we’ve earned it.”
Whether we choose to blame irresponsible parents for seemingly taking advantage of the system or not, we cannot punish their offspring for that which they never controlled. Instead, it’s time to show that hard work comes with reward. No matter one’s legal status, an education is never worthless.

Why?? because it is a way of life that we are used to and truth be told, it is hard to give up luxury for necessity.
First of all, common misconception put to rest. No human being is “ILLEGAL” the people you are referring to are undocumented. Thinking and comparing to the conditions one would put on humans considered illegal would be like bring back the slave trade which im sure everyone would agree is not the case here. 
Dear Have fun…:
Your comments prove ignorance and are a bit disappointing  not only in regards to the other university (UCLA), but in regards to M.E.Ch.A as well. That organization not only works towards empowering ‘Chican@s’ but towards empowering individuals regardless of culture, race, or gender. This group focuses on improving the educational system which im sure we all can agree still has a long ways to go before it can compare to the education received worldwide. Also as much as your intuition towards saying that MEChA holds a majority of the influence at the other school, I know a few other organizations that would claim just as much influence if not more. There are also Asian empowerment groups, Black empowerment groups, women empowerment groups, LGBT etc. You should visit the other campus, Im sure you’d be pleasantly surprised. 
One should not rely on fed information, but should go out and seek the truth. Use your critical mind and investigate what you are really being told and your sources…
USC Alum:
“environmental/ecological stress wrought by unchecked illegal immigrant population growth? what about the drain on our resources (energy, water)? what about the strain on our infrastructure?”
Growth, let alone humans is not illegal. We do not operate using the same political systems as China and India. One of the many reasons you can say you live in the United States of America. Second most of the environmental and ecological stress comes from the wealthy that over consume and waste, especially on things that they don’t need or use only once before throwing it away. Not to mention the gallons of water they use to water their lawns and excessive gardens over twice a day. Or the lights left on in office buildings throughout the day and night in downtown LA. If you seek to blame anyone look in your own back yard: it’s capitalism and it’s effects that you are seeing. The consumption rate of U.S. citizens, North Americans, us is pretty high for a country of our population and one of the highest in the world. [Reference international research organizations]
I would recommend an Econ course, some Poli Sci and a bit of International relations. The SPPD program would also be a good place for you to look into learning a bit more about these topics and I do encourage it. 
And if anyone is looking for the source of misinformation, yes look towards those we elected. Why is it that politicians seem like such a club? because it is, secrets, mistakes, failures, lost or squandered money: it all happens and stays there. Unless we get a good watchdog of sorts, but even then, now a days…no one wants to be the hero (aka martyr) . Why? because our system makes it impossible let alone suicidal to consider such a thing: Capitalism 
For answers, follow the money, and question who holds it and for what it is being used.
My question is this: How do “illegal” students contribute to the economy, when LEGIT college educated people have a hard time finding employment as it is? 
“Illegal” students aren’t inundating academically rigorous institutes like MIT or med school. How do identity-politics, “social phenonmena observing,” gov-studies type disciplines solve things like finding the cure for cancer; engineering a fuel to replace fossil fuels after they’re completely depleted; and so forth? They don’t. And universities need to permanently truncate these dumb-dumb majors, or relegate them to “diversity” requirements at most. 
The economy sucks as it is now, and it’s not improving. Even prior to the economy tanking in 2008, it’s not like “college educated” automatically meant job security or higher level income, etc. Bullshieet. 
How do a plethora of those with BAs under their belts contribute to this economy? More succinctly put, how do undergrads with nonpragmatic, non-STEM majors contribute to it? My cousins, friends, acquaintances came out of “high & mighty” academically prestigious schools such as Cal Berkeley, that school across town…and even here with BAs in sociology, linguistics, poli-sci and every other worthless study of “I’m young, progressive, and want to change the evils in society that whitey perpetuates, and he owes me a living”…and none of them found promising careers even after diligently trying; and this is prior to 2008. Ain’t nothing changed.
I’d just like to dismiss this “image” of undocumented studies as ethnic studies and sociology majors because it is not one that covers all students. I am undocumented and a rising senior at UC  Berkeley double-majoring in applied mathematics (economics) and statistics. I know plenty of other undocumented students who are majoring in things like biology, engineering, and other sciences. The whole “what-major-to-choose-and-how-it-helps-the-economy” discussion is not only applicable to undocumented students but to all students.
I think Dream Act needs to pass. People say that they are illegals and criminals. But they are college students who can contribute to the growth of US. These kids won’t go back to the country where their parents came from because they lived in US for the rest of their lives. But if we kick them out, it’s a waste, and we are sending the students who are educated out, while our OWN kids are playing games, using drugs, and wasting their lives. Illegals are the ones who actually study hard. Even UCLA came up with a study saying that if we gave illegals green cards and passed the Dream Act, it will generate 1.5TRILLION DOLLARS for our GDP. Also, these kids will mostly go to army to get citizenship. I seriously don’t get why people don’t want the Dream Act to pass when it will give us more money and army will get bigger.
Yes, and identity-politics, Chicano-studies classes will be the bulk of those universities’ majors, that’ll really spur the weak economy *sarcastic, condescending tone.*
“Even UCLA came up with a study saying that if we gave illegals green cards and passed the Dream Act, it will generate 1.5TRILLION DOLLARS for our GDP” -UCLA yaps a lot. And it’s not because it’s the rival school to SC. UCLA is strongly influenced by a Chicano-empowerment, MEChA sentiment.
“our OWN kids are playing games, using drugs, and wasting their lives. Illegals are the ones who actually study hard.”
this is according to… you?
“Even UCLA came up with a study saying that if we gave illegals green cards and passed the Dream Act, it will generate 1.5TRILLION DOLLARS for our GDP”
awesome. but what about the environmental/ecological stress wrought by unchecked illegal immigrant population growth? what about the drain on our resources (energy, water)? what about the strain on our infrastructure?
This is the only law that makes sense when it comes to illegal immigration. These are students, not criminals they are simply people who want to excel in the United States.
The problem with the United States of America is that we the people have voted for representatives who have deceived  us and will continue to deceive us until we vote people with morals, values, and a fear of the only living God into government.  The people who pay taxes are  supporting all those individuals who have always relied on the government(our tax dollars) to send them a check in the mail/give them food stamps to survive. I’m talking about  illegal aliens from any country who is living in America illegally and any American who has made a lifestyle of living off the government.  I support giving assistance to the disabled, the sick, the elderly, children, but not those individuals who can WORK  and should be made to WORK and not to illegal aliens.   Most of the representatives(democrat, republicans and others) have a vested interest in being a politician–they have personal  access to the largest bank in the United States of America—THE BANK OF TAXES PAID BY AMERICAN WORKERS.  Americans have been asleep for Decades—no longer will we our government to spend(steal) tax payers money without  checks and balances from the American Citizens.   Watch Your Backs.
