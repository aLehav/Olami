Students who always dreamed of becoming astronauts got the chance to explore their aspirations Thursday during a seminar discussing NASA’s Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.

Paul Marshall, the assistant program manager for Orion at NASA Johnson Space Center, and Lawrence Price, Orion deputy program manager for the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, spoke in Taper Hall about their roles in the Orion program.
Currently, the Orion is being developed to send crews of astronauts to explore asteroids, moons and Mars.
“As a country, as a nation, really as an international community of space programs, we’re committing to exploring the solar system with human beings,” Marshall said.
In 2004, President George W. Bush announced the original Orion project, then known as the Crew Exploration Vehicle. With Bush’s announcement came the creation of the Constellation Program, which seeks to develop new technologies to explore the depths of space.
In 2011 — seven years after the Orion was created — the Obama Administration replaced the program with the U.S. National Space Policy, issuing the goal to send crewed missions to Mars by mid-2030.
Though the spacecraft’s name was then changed from the Orion to the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, Price said none of the changes dramatically affected the program.
“Nothing has changed,” said Price. “This has always been about building machines to get humans to space.”
Both experts explained the structure and preparation that comes with developing the Orion. Marshall said the new technology behind the Orion is one of its key features.
“The central element is the crew module — larger heat shield, and thermal protection — we’re employing these new technologies to the Orion along with modern technological facets,” Marshall said.
NASA still has several problems to solve before the Orion’s official launch, however.
Once a crew heads to Mars for a mission, it would take approximately two years for them to return to Earth. Before a launch, the program must make observations and conduct tests to ensure the crew can stay safe for that stretch of time.
“It is a careful balance. A number of things that are biological and psychological still have to be solved,” Marshall said. “A total mission is a major commitment. It’s about 600-plus days out. There are a lot of problems that have to be solved before we let people commit to a mission.”
Though there are inevitable risks to sending astronauts to Mars, both the experts and students agreed that exploring the frontier of space is worth the risk.
“Space is the essence of the pioneer experience characterized by human exploration,” said Jake Hunter, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering. “It is the next and most logical step on the evolutionary chain.”
Learning about the Orion in detail also helped some students, such as Haley Buckley, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering, put their personal aspirations into account.
“I think the most important part to me was hearing about the time-frame they have to send humans out there because I want to be an astronaut,” Buckley said. “Hearing that kind of information has helped me put everything into perspective.”

The plans approved by the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee to redevelop University Village have met resistance from several city councilmembers and activist groups who are concerned about the negative effects of the project on the community.
Retail · University administrators and government officials hope to negotiate a plan that will serve both students and the community. – Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
Though USC says the project will create 12,000 jobs, 4,000 new beds for student housing and a new retail complex, opponents maintain the construction threatens to displace established businesses and gentrify the area, leaving lower-income tenants unable to afford the new cost of living.
University officials, however, claim the plan will actually help residents of the area.
“The university sees this plan as doing the exact opposite, by enticing students to leave community housing and come to university-owned housing,” said David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations at USC, who has heard many community concerns about the Village project in the past five years of negotiations.
Galaviz also said he has mainly heard questions about what benefits the project will bring, not about the potential negative consequences of the project.
“They’re asking if [the redevelopment] can provide them with a new movie theater or a restaurant that has tablecloths and window curtains where they can take their families,” Galaviz said.
The university and supporters of the plan, including Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, hope the benefits of this new complex will extend beyond students to the greater community of South Los Angeles.
“This investment represents nearly $1 billion and close to 12,000 jobs, many of which will be dedicated to the local community,” said a statement from the mayor’s office. “As the city’s economy recovers, it is important that we focus our efforts on areas that have been hardest hit by the economic downturn to ensure there is a place in the recovery for all. This project provides that opportunity for the residents of South Los Angeles.”
Some city councilmembers worry that this isn’t the case, and that the new project is instead catering too much to student needs. They are concerned the area could suffer if the plan uproots small businesses in the area.
“There are dozens and dozens of businesses that have been in that area for decades,” said Councilman Bernard Parks, who participated in the negotiations and represents some of the area surrounding USC. “It appears that ’SC has decided that they will not consider giving any of those businesses the guarantee to come back to the shopping center, and in fact the university’s message is that it will not even consider them.”
Now that the plan awaits city approval, USC maintains that it will focus its negotiation efforts on tenants who face eviction when construction begins. USC has been conducting extensive surveys of local businesses to determine their needs as the plan moves forward.
“We have a range of services already prepared for them, to help them find access to capital to sustain them during the demolition and to help with business plans and job training,” said Craig Keys, the associate senior vice president of civic engagement at USC.
The city said it has also made a concerted effort to promote the success of these small businesses. Villaraigosa and his Small Business Services Team are working toward addressing the community’s needs and helping them develop feasible business plans.
Community groups are also concerned that the project’s focus on student housing will eclipse the need for affordable housing for families and non-students in the area.
“For decades, the developers have gone into the north University Park area, and they have converted most of the single-family residences into mini-dormitories,” Parks said. “Many of these reconfigurations were not done to code, and there are significant parking issues. The university should assist owners of property so they have access to low-interest loans so that non-students who want to live around the university can have access to quality housing.”
To help solve this issue, USC’s end of the agreement includes giving $20 million to bolster affordable, non-student housing in the area and creating a counseling service for local tenants within the Gould School of Law.
According to Galaviz, community support for the plan has grown as community members have become more familiar with what the project would entail.
“There’s a perception of what this project is,” Galaviz said. “But once community members find out what this project is instead of what the perception is, there’s been a lot of support for this project.”
Parks also said he believes USC, the city and the community can come together to create a compromise that is mutually beneficial. Though some opponents bring up disappointment in USC’s disregard for its community impact in the past, Parks is hopeful that this project can be salvaged if the university takes steps to consider the community.
“It’s very important to the community that it’s done right because you can’t redo it,” Parks said. “And the community certainly has a right to have a say in what happens.”
First and foremost, north university park was a wealthy area when USC established itself in the area. The creation of vehicles caused the migration of the wealthy population. So the “ghetto” evolved over time as migration patterns changed. People opted to live in the suburbs instead of urban areas. Looking 15 years back, USC was a commuter campus without the need to house students. Congested freeways, out of state student enrollment,  and foreign exchange students caused students to live near campus causing a demographic shift in the community.  USC could not meet the demand and private properties provided the much needed relief to students. As demands for housing continues, the price for rent is rises (economics). Gentrification is occurring many urban areas as gas prices rise and commutes become unbearable. Downtown Los Angeles has began gentrification which is a step away from the area.  Keep in mind, students living away from home is a recent phenomenon and should consider to some degree the needs of the community in terms of retail space and the congestion it will undoubtedly bring to the neighborhood. In terms of low income housing, that should be left to the City of Los Angeles not an institution of learning.  However, students are now becoming part of “the community” and should be accommodated.
All true. North of campus (North University Park) is now almost entirely student housing.
However, that does not negate the fact that the USC administration has not been honest with its intentions. USC had a long range plan to aquire UV land by eminent domain by using the Hoover Project as its agent. The UV had a 25 contract with the CRA and the City. USC aquired the UV 13 years ago and let it run down while announcing upon acquisition that it would maintain and improve it. It did just the opposite.
The organizations demanding low income housing are bogus and are not truly community based. USC administration knows this even if the student body does not. But USC is allowing itself to be extorted to the tune of $20M anyway.
One must ask why?
@Tim,
In 1880 there was quite a bit of open space around what is now the campus.   Ask North University Park as she was here at that time.
Meow!
What I have observed is that any positive changes that have happened over time in North University Park is unduly and unfairly credited to USC. On the contrary, for years it was in the University’s interest to keep the area depressed since it could pick up land for expansion at bargain prices. And if that didn’t work there was always eminent domain.
USC was the hidden hand behind the Hoover Redevelopment Project which took the land for the UV by eminent domain. USC also has eminent domain but has never dared use it in its own name.
Certain bogus community groups are indeed extorting USC but the University has decided to pay them off as more expedient than lawsuits and bad publicity. Also, there are certain things that would be exposed in a lawsuit that USC would prefer to keep hushed up.
As for Parks, he is caught in the middle. I do not believe he is connected with the extortion groups which some would like to link him to. 
None of the legitimate concerns he expressed in the interview  are being discussed such as parking impacts and conversion of single family houses to mini-dorms without permits.
Look. Just think about what you’re saying. Where would the neighborhood be if USC had packed up and left in the 60s? How does the rest of South Central L.A. look? There’s your answer. 
“On the contrary, for years it was in the University’s interest to keep the area depressed since it could pick up land for expansion at bargain prices.” – I don’t see much logic here. Look at how much USC spends every day on security patrols. What good is buying land at bargain basement prices when you have to spend millions every year to guard it 24/7? The University slowed the descent of the area and has been trying to reverse it for quite some time. It’s true whether or not you acknowledge it. 
You also seem extremely bitter about the old Hoover Redevelopment Project. Yes, the city used eminent domain to rebuild the area. So what? The city used it to build Dodger Stadium and all of the freeways too. Do I like the eminent domain process? No, but I’m not going to blame USC for wanting someone to redevelop the area around campus. Were you personally affected by that? If so, I’m sorry, but you should move on with your life. We’re talking about something that happened over 50 years ago. 
Please, feel free to tell us some of these things that would be exposed in a lawsuit. You might even be able to sway me to your side if you start explaining your position. All I see in your comments is an irrational hate of everything that USC touches. Trust me: you aren’t convincing anyone right now. 
Parking is a definitely a legitimate concern, but how does the conversion of single family houses to mini-dorms without permits have anything to do with the topic at hand? Parks is grasping at straws there. USC is not responsable for these dorm conversions; private landlords are. In fact, this redevelopment should help alleviate that problem. Most students prefer to live in University housing, given the chance. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some of those houses being returned to single family residences again.
1.)Use of the term “South Central” is very telling. There is no area in Los Angeles called “South Central”. Instead that term is code for any neighborhood that has a Black population. 
2.)The security guards are a recent phenomenom and are basically just for show and to calm the nerves of concerned parents about the area. They are unarmed. A student was killed a couple of years ago as he staggered home drunk from a party at 3 in the morning and instigated an altercation. The yellow jackets have been USC’s response to that. They don’t guard property.
3).Hoover Redevelopment did not happen 50 years ago. It was in the late 70s and USC was indeed the hidden hand behind it. Institutions can plan for decades while all living beings have finite life spans. The agreement to maintain the UV for community use was to last 25 years. USC bought it 13 years ago and let it run down. That made it more acceptable to tear it down.
4.)Since Parks is one of the more conservative members of the City Council (Did you not know that he was Chief of Police?) the attemps to link him to bogus poverty pimp groups is thinly disguised racism. There is no grounds for it.
5. Single family houses that have been illegally converted to mini-dorms by adding bedrooms where living rooms and dining rooms used to be will never be attractive as single family homes again. If the students move out (not likely) the most likely use will be sober living houses and group homes. Not an attractive prospect.
6. If we at least agree on parking as a problem then why doesn’t USC do something about it?
Answer: It suits USC to have unrestricted free neighborhood parking North of campus and frees up funds that would otherwise have to be spent on parking structures on campus.
1) Who cares.
2) Agreed—they should be armed.
3) Let’s be real—the UV sucks. It’s dirty, dilapidated, and the stores are, for the most part, pretty bad. I just can’t understand why you wouldn’t want something new and clean. Maybe you like the ghetto atmosphere?
4) No idea, but I’m sure the fact that I’m voting for Romney is “thinly disguised racism,” too.
5) My solution: raze the whole area.
6) I park in a parking lot, so I never have an issue with this. (That said, the parking lot at your favorite place, the UV, is terrible.)
Why haven’t you moved out already? There’s nothing that great about this place. I’m certainly never coming back once I’m out of here.
I would love to know what is your connection if any to USC?  Do you just live in the neighborhood or are somehow associated with USC?  Are you or were you student at one time?   How did you come to learn all this about the City, USC and the politics of the neighborhood?
The ongoing debate discussed in this article is utter nonsense.  The very premise behind the debate that USC needs to embrace the community as it moves forward with UV development plans is faulty.  That neighborhood of South LA would be nothing without USC, and USC has specifically spent hundreds of thousand of dollars on various improvements throughout the adjacent area.  This does not even take into consideration the volunteer hours and efforts of countless students, staff and faculty who participate in any of the many community outreach programs.  There are few models for community involvment and outreach as outstanding as that present between USC and the surrounding community.  It is a complete insult to the University to suggest that it does not do enough for the community, or that it should do more.  
Efforts by Bernard Park and various community groups to ensure USC sets money aside for low-income housing, or provide guarantees to merchants displaced by the UV development, is pure extortion!  It’s an outrage, and again, suggests that the University does not meet or exceed any reasonable efforts to be an active and meaningful member of the community.  USC did not take the land upon which the University Village sits through eminant domain, and there was never any obligation to address community concerns.  That mall and the land on which it sits was purchased by USC fair and square, and can be developed by the University for any purpose it sees fit.  The community can thank USC that it has established such a generous partnership with the community, and that it chooses actively to extend goodwill to the community.  USC was established there in the late 1800’s, and I think it is fair to suggest that it is as much a founding member of the community as anyone else who may have moved in since.
The school is going to spend a billion dollars in South Central without public subsidy. And “the community may suffer” because of it?  That is utterly ridiculous. 
Parks wants to tell USC how to run its leasing operations and he wants the university to subsidize the private housing market too? Is he insane? 
USC has been more than willing to work with the community throughout the entire development process. The community is involved and they want this project. I don’t know what Parks has been smoking lately, but he needs to stop. He cannot be allowed to extort the University. 
And honestly, how could building more student housing possibly be a bad thing for community residents? Private landlords will actually have to compete with the university on price, lowering rents, and there will be fewer students looking for housing on the private market, leading to more housing for neighborhood residents. If the housing isn’t suitable for families, the landlords will either have to renovate it or lower their rent. Either is good for the community. 
USC wants to be a “good neighbor” and try to work around whatever concerns the community may have. It’s a noble goal, but Parks and friends are not living up to their end of the bargain. USC gives, and then Parks demands even more. Not acceptable.
Very well-said Matt.  It is extortion.  The community surrounding USC would be a forgotten corner of the City if it were not for USC and the positive influence it has on the community.  The University IS that community.  It was founded there when little else existed.  If anything, the community has let the University down… not the other way around.
USC should pick up its piles of money, find a clean location on the Westside and let this “community” around the current campus location turn into the 3rd world ghetto the politicians are dying to turn it into. Let’s face it – the area around USC might as well be in Mexico – if Mexico also had a large black gang problem as well. SO sick of the ‘hood and thug element in the neighborhood. Here the university is trying to clean up the place and make it nice for everyone and these idiot politicians and community activists are trying to keep it like a Mexican barrio
It can not be overstated that the land for UV was acquired by eminent domain for community benefit. 
Actually, Parks is one of the more conservative council members and is not associated with the so called community activists who have displaced the real community voices. 
I think the USC administration knows this and just finds it more expedient to pay off carpet bagger organizations such as SAJE, who have hijacked the real community,  than to address real community concerns.
“the community” just shot up the student center. I don’t think we should give a damn what the Master Plan does for them at this point.
The word “community” is bandied about so loosely that it should be defined. My understanding is that the miscreants involved in the USC approved event came from far outside the area.
Is “community” code for Black?
Hey Bernard,
How much do want? $20million wasn’t enough?
What a bum.
Hey Bernard,
USC owns the land, they can do with that land as they please. I know you are a big fan of hand-outs but my hope is USC stands up for itself and says NO!!

It was nearly midnight  on Wednesday when Autumn Battani, a freshman majoring in psychology, heard several loud sounds while standing by the center of campus — a Halloween prank, she thought at first.
“And then all of the sudden everyone around us got on the ground,” Battani said. “Then they all got up and started running. It happened so fast, I didn’t even know what happened or why everyone was running, so I ran too.”
Like hundreds of other students and guests, Battani was waiting in line to enter “Freak or Greek,” an on-campus Halloween party. Then, several gunshots rang out, sending a mass of panicked students running in all directions.
The Los Angeles Police Department has detained two suspects — both unaffiliated with USC — related to  the shooting, which left one victim in critical condition and three other victims injured. The shooting occurred about 100 yards from the campus center.
As students ran for cover after the shooting, the party underneath in the Campus Center basement continued because the area was on lockdown.
“Music continued to play, and they continued to party,” LAPD Cmdr. Bob Green said during a briefing early Thursday morning.
The event, which began at 9 p.m. and hit an attendance of about 400 students, was planned as an exception to the university’s scheduling rule — events taking place past 10 p.m., play loud music or serve alcohol are required to take place on weekends.
“In this case, the event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween,” Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson said in a statement.
An outside promoter, LA Hype, advertised the event on social media and event pages. Admission was free for USC students, according to an advertisement on the online aggregator AllEvents, and discounted for guests who were members of fraternities or sororities, or in costume.
Though alcohol was prohibited, the advertisement AllEvents told students to “PreGame before the party” and “not bring any substances on campus” because of citations.
LA Hype could not be reached for comment.
Eleven Dept. of Public Safety officers were sent as security for the event, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. In addition, students confirmed that at least two Contemporary Services Corporation officers checked IDs, searched for alcohol and conducted pat-downs. DPS uses CSC officers to provide security checks at events.
DPS uses a special events coordinator to recommend the amount of security personnel necessary at events, Carlisle said.
As more people flocked to the Campus Center for the event, DPS deployed three additional officers to organize those waiting to enter the party. More than 100 people were lined up outside moments before the shooting, according to eyewitness reports.
“They were a large mass of people trying to funnel into the entrance of the ballroom,” Carlisle said. “And we were in the process of trying to line them up on Trousdale [Parkway] when the shooting occurred.”
The party, having been advertised heavily on the Internet, attracted students who were not affiliated with the university, such as Rayamen Middlebrooks, a 21-year-old community college student. Middlebrooks said he knew the event might get out of hand.
“Honestly, from the beginning, I knew how the crowd was,” Middlebrooks said. “Things were going to happen.”
The university required attendants to show an ID from USC or another university, according to a statement from USC President C. L. Max Nikias.
Following the shooting, Middlebrooks and his friend Andre Shields, a 20-year-old community college student, were in disbelief that gunshots would be fired at USC.
“And you just don’t think it was gunshots on the USC campus, out of everywhere else,” Middlebrooks said. “But yeah, gunshots on USC campus.”
Law enforcement officials are not aware of the reason behind the altercation that led to the shooting. LAPD’s investigation is ongoing.
BSA Executive Director Lamar Gary declined to comment for this story. Undergraduate Student Government, which oversees BSA, also declined to comment.

Despite the initial shock of the news of Wednesday night’s shooting on campus, many students and parents remain confident in the safety of the USC campus, but wonder if the university is doing all it can.
“USC’s claim regarding safety is that you must be cautious outside of campus, but on campus you feel completely safe,” said Lexi Chamberlin, an undeclared freshman. “This will change a lot of people’s opinions.”
Students’ concerns are coupled with hopes of seeing improved security on and around campus. Many students noted the importance of enacting more stringent policies when it comes to letting non-USC students on campus, and said they would like to see more detailed and timely emergency alerts.
“We need to be more proactive checking people when they come into campus instead of DPS being active after things happen,” said Jake Huhn, a senior majoring in communication. “I think DPS did a good job of responding to it and I think the Trojan Alerts worked really well.”
Trojans Alert, the university’s mobile alert system, sent out a message informing students of the shooting. The alert went out roughly 30 minutes after four victims were shot, one critically and the other three with non-life threatening injuries.
The incident is the second shooting that involved university students in or near campus this year.  Six months ago, two graduate students from China were killed in a botched robbery blocks from campus. In the wake of these two incidents, parents also hope to see more attentiveness to the university’s security policies.
“It definitely concerns me that there were non-USC students on campus after hours on an evening that is notorious for trouble,” said Jamie Ratliff, mother of Mary Pat Ratliff, a freshman majoring in international relations global business. “Halloween is a night that things happen. The policy should be enforced and even more stringent.”
Some parents believe the university should create stronger security policies.
“We’re not panicking, but the department needs to take a closer look at their system,” said John Schoff, father of Jonathan Stoller-Schoff, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “It comes down to running drills and having an immediate response team put together, and, in the weeks to come, I would like to hear from the department what they learned from this so we know they’re listening to our concerns.”
President C. L. Max Nikias said he will announce new security policies early next week, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“I feel really safe here,” said Emily Rosenfield, a freshman majoring in studio guitar. “They reacted quickly, and it didn’t involve any USC students or faculty. … It doesn’t change the fact that I feel safe on campus.”
 
Mollie Berg and Chelsea Stone contributed to this report.
When visiting our daughter at USC we have always felt “safe”.  However these after hour events need top security polices in place and the kids before entering campus should be scaned for weapons etc. (yes like at the airport). Its the world we live in unfortunately.  A few ruin it for the rest of us.

At least seven shots were fired Wednesday outside a Halloween party in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at approximately 11:45 p.m, leaving one victim in critical condition and three others wounded.
Rescue · A gunshot victim is lifted into an ambulance by paramedics at the scene of Wednesday’s shooting outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The shooting left four injured. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The shooting occurred after an altercation between a suspect and Geno Hall, a former Crenshaw High School football star who is in critical but stable condition after undergoing three hours of surgery, according to the Los Angeles Times. Neither the suspects nor the victims were affiliated with USC. Classes across the university continued as normal Thursday.
The Times reported that Wednesday’s shooting was the first to occur on USC’s campus since 1992.
The shots were fired about 100 yards from a Halloween costume party, “Freak or Greek,” that was held in the campus center’s ballroom. The event, which began at 9 p.m., was promoted by LA Hype and Black Student Assembly.
The event drew a crowd of about 400 with more than 100 students lined up outside waiting to enter the party, according to eyewitness reports.
“We were waiting outside to get into the party, and we were waiting for a while — maybe 20 or 30 minutes,” said Olivia Gordon, a freshman majoring in psychology. “And all of a sudden, as soon as people started going inside, there were multiple gunshots and everyone who was in line for the party ducked and we all ran.”
The other three victims sustained relatively minor injuries and are expected to make a full recovery, according to the LAPD. All four were taken to California Hospital Medical Center.
A confrontation occurred between Hall and the suspect, which led the suspect to open fire on Hall, inadvertently injuring three others in the process, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. Hall, the intended victim, was shot seven times in the left thigh, back of his leg, buttocks and arm.
“I heard three gunshots … there might have been more than that,” said Christina Nour, a freshman majoring in civil engineering building science. “Then I ducked. It didn’t feel real. It felt like it was a movie, because I really haven’t experienced anything like this before. I was running as fast as I can, trying to make sure I didn’t get trampled or tripped. I just ran as fast as I could, as far as I could.”
University policy permits student parties to be open to USC students and students from other colleges with a school ID. USC President C. L. Max Nikias said the university will review this policy in light of Wednesday’s incident. In an email to the Times on Thursday, Nikias said he would announce changes in university security policies early next week.
“Nothing is more important to me than the safety of our students, faculty and staff,” Nikias said in the email. “I have already initiated an expedited process for this thorough review. I will announce changes in our policies early next week.”
Nikias issued a statement on USC’s website Thursday in which he reassured parents and students of USC’s efforts to promote safety. He emphasized that the individuals involved in the shooting were not affiliated with the university.
Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, also released a statement early Thursday morning on the university’s website, saying DPS had been monitoring the area because of the party. Fourteen officers were on the scene at the time of the shooting, Carlisle said.
Like Nikias, Jackson also noted the importance of a safe campus.
“This incident reminds us that we must look out for ourselves and be particularly vigilant about the personal safety of friends and guests at our social events,” Jackson said.
After the shooting, officers at the scene identified the shooter as well as an unidentified male who was fleeing the scene with him. Officers followed the two to Parking Lot 6 near Kaprielian Hall and detained them; they also retrieved the handgun used in the shooting from the ground at the lot.
DPS and LAPD quickly cordoned off the area near the shooting, from Bovard Auditorium to Mudd Hall and from the Campus Center to the eastern edge of Hahn Plaza. The entire University Park Campus was locked down soon after.
Despite the lockdown, LAPD said the event in the Campus Center was allowed to continue even as the shooting and its aftermath unfolded outside.
At approximately 2 a.m., DPS and LAPD opened the campus to students, faculty and staff with USC identification. The entire campus was reopened at 4:52 a.m.
Asst. DPS Chief John Thomas said that the incident was not indicative of the overall level of safety in and around USC.
“[USC has] a great partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department,” he said. “We are one of the safest campuses in the country — we make sure that we have the necessary resources at the event, we do necessary planning and unfortunately [the shooting] happened outside. These are individuals that unfortunately came here and decided to disrupt what otherwise would have been a very peaceful event, like all of our events on campus.”
Sean Fitz-Gerald, Joey Kaufman, Eddie Kim and Yasmeen Serhan contributed to this report.
alcohol, fraternities, guns — USC is trouble city
people have no respect for life or others there, more security is needed at all parties and events
I am a concerned parent. I can’t believe they would let a party continue after a shooting like that.  If non students are admitted to the campus for a party, they should be submitted to a weapon search. I went to the USC, Syracuse game in New Jersey last month and our bags and jackets were searched for weapons, booze etc. There were a lot more than 1500 people and if Giants Stadium was able to do it, why can’t USC do the same? The school needs to be more concerned about student safety and less about offending the communities that surround the campus. What if a stray bullet struck a SC student in the head, or anybody,  for that matter?
Security is not the problem, no amount of security can prevent crazed criminals from doing crazy things.  Seal of the campus!

USC men’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic has never lost to UC Santa Barbara during his tenure: Thirty-two matches against the Gauchos have resulted in 32 Trojan victories
The No. 1 Trojans (20-0, 5-0) will look to keep that streak as well as their undefeated season alive this weekend, when they host the No. 3 Gauchos (15-6, 1-3) for a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference match Saturday.
USC and UCLA are the only squads with an undefeated MPSF conference record right now, and are on target to play for the top seed in the conference tournament when USC visits the Bruins for its final regular season game.
Having lost three of four Pac-12 matches, the Gauchos are reeling but will still provide more than just a tune-up for the Bruins match-up in two weeks.
“They [UCSB] have a pretty solid starting six,” Vavic said. “They go to their two-meter men a lot so we need to adjust our defense to keep them covered.”
The team is pretty straight forward about their goals for this weekend.
“We want to play to the advantage of the crowd and give them just as much of a romp as last time,” senior two-meter Matt Burton said.
In the team’s previous matchup this season in late September, the Trojans throttled the Gauchos 14-5 at Santa Barbara to win the SoCal tournament.
“Everything went right for us in that game,” sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias said. “We scored every open shot and just started really strong and gave them no hope.”
That game might not be the best indicator of how Saturday’s matchup will play out, though. It was both teams’ fourth game that weekend, and the Gauchos’ fatigue was noticeable in the championship match. Saturday’s game is the only one for both squads this week, and the game flow will be different since USC and UCSB have had all week to prepare for one another.
The tandem of junior driver Nikola Vavic and Genidounias will once again lead an explosive Trojan attack. Genidounias has scored a hat trick in each of his last four games, while the younger Nikola Vavic has scored in every game and leads the team with 57 goals. Vavic’s 57 goals are the most scored in a season by a USC player since 2005.
The Trojans won all three of their games last week, but, perhaps since the Trojans are so dominant in the pool, bad habits continue to linger.
The Trojans defeated Cal Lutheran in their final game of the weekend, but coach Vavic and his team are not pleased with the 21-9 score — specifically with the nine goals allowed.
“We have this tendency that once we get a lead, we lax off in our defense,” Burton said. “We definitely had some holes in our defense last week, but we need to play good, solid defense. That’s what has won us championships in the past, and that’s what’s going to win this year’s championship.”
Jovan Vavic has seen a recurring issue all season that could cost the Trojans down the road.
“We’re not focused in practice, and it carries over into games,” Vavic said.
This year’s squad only has three seniors that are receiving significant playing time, and Jovan Vavic attributed a lack of leadership to USC’s struggles on the defensive end.
“Our guys need to step up in leadership roles,” Jovan Vavic said. “Losing Joel [Dennerley] and Peter [Kurzeka] from last year really hurts because Peter was a great leader and Joel was very local.”
The coach did offer a solution, though.
“We have to do a better job of communicating in the water,” he said. “Guys need to listen.”

USC (5-10-3, 2-6-2 ) hopes to close out the 2012 season on a high note as they take on No. 2 UCLA (15-1-2, 8-1-1) on Friday, Nov. 2 at 2 p.m. at McAlister Field .
The Women of Troy are coming off a pair of 1-0 losses to No. 1 Stanford in double overtime and No. 21 California. All but three of USC’s games have been one-goal games or ties, and USC has played eight overtime games this season.
“There were some questionable calls in the game on Friday,” redshirt sophomore defender Mia Bruno said. “We were really proud of the way we played on Friday. We felt like we had them.”
The team isn’t down on itself, either.
“After the weekend we had, we’re picking our spirits back up,” Bruno said. “We’ve forgotten about it, and now we’re focusing our attention on the upcoming game.”
The Women of Troy are led in scoring by junior midfielder Jordan Marada and senior midfielder/forward Samantha Johnson, each with four goals. Marada also has five assists on the season.
UCLA is coming off its first loss of the season against No. 1 Stanford. They are led by Pac-12 leading scorer Zakiya Bywaters, who has 12 goals this season, and goalkeeper Katelyn Rowland, who has 35 saves and six goals allowed in 15 appearances.
USC is 4-20-1 all-time against UCLA, losing 5-2 last year in Westwood and last winning 1-0 in 2010 at the Coliseum. The last game at McAlister Field was won 2-1 by the Bruins in overtime in 2006.
“This season has been a growing year,” Bruno said, “There have been a lot of freshman and transfers. I think this is good for them and all of us to learn and we’re gonna have a lot more experience for next season. We’re only losing five seniors and we have a lot of good recruits coming in, so things are looking up.”
The game will be televised on Pac-12 Los Angeles.

Though a shooting outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday night placed the University Park Campus on lockdown, USC continued its previously scheduled Thursday morning workout at Howard Jones Field.
The shooting, which left four persons wounded, including one in critical condition, occurred outside a Halloween party known as “Freak or Greek.” The event was held in the ballroom of the Campus Center.
When asked during his post-practice news conference if players attended the party, USC coach Lane Kiffin said, “What I know, they were not.”
Less than 12 hours after the shooting occurred, though, Kiffin declined to comment further.
“I really don’t have enough facts on the situation to make any other comments about it,” he said. “I think they’re still gathering all the information, so I can’t really talk any more about it, just because of a lack of information.”
According to a report from the Los Angeles Times, the individual in critical condition at California Hospital Medical Center was Geno Hall, a decorated former cornerback at nearby Crenshaw High School.
Two current USC players, sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard and sophomore guard Marcus Martin, were teammates with Hall at Crenshaw.
“We’ll want to know all the information about it,” Kiffin added. “We’ve been in meetings all morning, since 6 this morning. So when the time comes, I’m sure that they’ll inform me.”

With the first half of their Pac-12 schedule in the books, the USC women’s volleyball team has overcome early struggles to post a five-game winning streak and regain the confidence which they used to dominate their opponents. But as they embark on a four-game road trip and begin the second half of competition, the Women of Troy are by no means out of the woods yet.
The No.6 ranked Women of Troy start an important trip in the desert this weekend, squaring off against Arizona State on Friday night before a bout with Arizona on Sunday morning. Though the Sun Devils (15-10) and Wildcats (12-11) are both above .500 overall, they have struggled in Pac-12 competition, posting identical 4-8 records.
Head Coach Mick Haley stressed not only the importance of winning on the road, but also avoiding complacency.
“Winning on the road is extremely important for us, because we have six of our ten matches on the road in the second round,” Haley said. “Arizona State was not happy that they lost here, and [the coach] vowed that they’d give us a great battle this time, so we have to take that seriously and prepare for that.”
Coming into last weekend, the Women of Troy simply wanted to get better, and they accomplished that with consecutive wins over Washington and Washington State. More importantly, the five-set victory over the Huskies was revenge for the sweep the Women of Troy suffered on their trip to Washington, one of their three Pac-12 losses this season.
“I thought it was a good performance. When we left Washington, we felt like we should have won, even though they beat us 3-0,” Haley said. “We felt like we weren’t in sync, and we made too many errors here to win it 3-0. But we kept gaining more and more confidence as the match progressed, so I think winning in five games is fine.”
The Women of Troy twice overcame deficits to win Friday’s match, taking the final two sets to turn back a 2-1 hole (23-25, 25-22, 22-25, 25-23, 15-10). Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio put on another outstanding performance, registering a career-high 30 kills along with 12 digs for her seventh double-double. Sophomore setter Hayley Crone notched 51 assists and junior libero Natalie Hagglund recorded a career-high 34 digs to anchor the defense.
USC made quick work of a weaker Washington State team Saturday, winning 25-13, 25-17, 25-18 for its 15th sweep of the season. This time, it was outside hitter Sara Shaw’s turn to shine, as the junior recorded a career-high 18 kills and attacked at a .643 clip without any errors.
“Washington was definitely a tough match, but I think it was good that it went five games, because we hadn’t played one like that all year,” Shaw said. “Washington State also came out and played hard, and I think the wins are good for our confidence as we go on the road.”
Haley believes that the upcoming road games are crucial to the season.
“The most important thing is that we have to take these games seriously and prepare for them well,” Haley said. “Winning on the road is an entirely different situation, and these teams are going to put forth a much better effort, so we need to prepare adequately.”
The Women of Troy will conclude their road trip next weekend with matches against Utah and Colorado.

For those of you who can’t get enough of Lane Kiffin, another cantankerous coach sporting a visor will occupy a Coliseum sideline this Saturday: Oregon’s Chip Kelly.
Of course these days, the visor and surly personality might be the only similarities these two share.
To say Kelly came out of nowhere is a bit generous. The 2010 Associated Press Coach of the Year’s skyrocketing career began at Columbia in 1990 where he was a secondary and special teams coach — not for the varsity team, I might add, but for the freshman squad.
After graduating from New Hampshire with a Bachelor of Science in physical education, the greatest offensive mastermind in Division I college football — apologies to Mike Leach — couldn’t even land an assistant position on Columbia’s varsity coaching staff.
Let that marinate for a moment. Playing in the “rugged” Ivy League, the Columbia football program’s all-time record is 371-625-43. Columbia’s Wien Stadium seats a mere 17,000, and the program’s only notable football alumnus is novelist and former tailback Jack Kerouac. To be fair, though, Kerouac had a higher calling than running the football.
Kiffin, on the other hand, has coaching in his blood.
Perhaps the greatest fodder for Kiffin’s detractors has always been the entitled air with which he has coasted through his coaching career — the idea that Kiffin has ridden his father’s coattails and not earned his keep. The icon of “Arrogant Nation” still stands as the youngest head coach in the Bowl Championship Series, but his records with the Oakland Raiders (5-15) and Tennessee (7-6) — not to mention his bouts of controversy at those stops — never really seemed to merit his third head coaching chance.
No one can claim that Kelly never paid his dues, however, as the Oregon coach toiled in obscurity as the offensive coordinator for New Hampshire for eight years. In seven of those seasons, his teams produced better than 400 yards per game in total offense.
Upon first learning of Kiffin’s hiring, I remember questioning why USC sought out the rabble-rouser who famously tweaked Urban Meyer and Tim Tebow before the 2009 season and later lost to No. 1 Florida. Kiffin appeared to be a classic attention-seeker and self-promoter.
Factor in the reality that USC was awaiting the results of an NCAA investigation into NCAA violations, and I couldn’t wrap my mind around former Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s boldness. Kiffin arrived during an unprecedented confluence of events — Pete Carroll’s stunning departure and the 2010 sanctions.
Though I won’t argue that Kiffin was more qualified than other candidates or that he’s been perfect or that he’s not sometimes infuriatingly stubborn, he’s loyal to the program and can still recruit with the best.
Most newly hired coaches — even Rick Neuheisel — are allowed four years before they are judged by their results.
The USC fan base must briefly suspend judgment and not be so reactionary. You can’t love the crabby, evasive Kiffin and hail him as a maverick when USC wins, and then pan him for those same attributes when the Trojans suffer an upset.
A couple of unfortunate losses later, we’re right back where we were midway through 2011. Fans are once again imploring Kiffin to fire his father and hire an offensive playcaller. Some are directly calling for Kiffin’s dismissal.
Kiffin muffled those calls in 2011 when the Trojans rampaged through their final four games of the season, beating their opponents by a combined 101 points. Apparently, that string of success did not build up enough capital with USC fans base to earn Kiffin the benefit of the doubt if the Trojans stumbled in 2012.
In the thankless field of college football coaching, wins are soon forgotten, while losses fester long after the final whistle blows.
Hopefully for Kiffin, a victory against Oregon on Saturday will once again ingratiate him to the USC fan base. The challenge could not be steeper, however, as the other visor from up north just continues to win.

I don’t think you can call Kiffin the youngest coach in the BCS until he actually coaches in a BCS game.  Maybe you were looking for ‘FBS’

Less than two years ago, it seemed De’Anthony Thomas would be the next great running back to play for “Tailback U,” as USC is often called.
Thomas, who was deemed “The Black Mamba” by Snoop Dogg, went to nearby Crenshaw High School, and had committed to USC near the end of his junior year.

“Obviously, we loved him,” said USC defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron, who helped recruit Thomas to Troy. “We thought he was a great young man, a very explosive player.”
Even though there was some speculation that USC coach Lane Kiffin wanted to utilize Thomas as a cornerback, people figured that Kiffin would find a way to get the ball to a player that ended up leading Crenshaw to two Los Angeles City Section championships, primarily as a running back.
Thomas was poised to follow in the footsteps of great Trojan running backs like O.J. Simpson and Reggie Bush — without the contentious headlines those footsteps eventually led to.
But then, Thomas stirred up a controversy by simply changing his mind: On Feb. 2, 2011, Thomas rescinded his commitment to USC and signed with Oregon.
“It was such a shock,” Kiffin said at Pac-12 Media Day in 2011. “Here was a kid that had been ’SC for so long. … This wasn’t one of those guys we ever thought was wavering at all. It was probably our strangest story in recruiting.”
It turned out Thomas loved the Ducks.
In choosing Oregon, he chose a school that doesn’t quite have the storied history behind its football program that USC boasts, but has stolen the spotlight since Chip Kelly was hired as the Ducks’ offensive coordinator in 2007.
Since Kelly implemented his high-octane spread attack, the Ducks have churned out an impressive list of backs themselves: Jonathan Stewart, LeGarrette Blount and LaMichael James all helped transform Oregon into a perennial powerhouse.
“They’ve done a tremendous job with their program,” Orgeron said. “They do a great job of marketing with those uniforms, and all the other things that they do to sell Oregon the right way.”
Thomas had taken an official visit to Eugene, Ore., days before recommitting right before the deadline for high school seniors to make their final decision.
“[Thomas] contacted us during the last week of recruitment, and came in during that last weekend for a visit,” Oregon coach Chip Kelly said. “We showed him what our school is about, what we have to offer … he made the decision based on what he thought was best for him, more than anything else.”
It’s hard to argue with that reasoning, especially after seeing the results of the Black Mamba’s historic season last year.
Thomas set Oregon’s freshman record with 18 all-purpose touchdowns — seven rushing, nine receiving, and two kickoff returns.
He was named a Freshman All-American and All-Pac-12 first team kick returner and was the only player in the nation with 400 or more yards from rushing, receiving and kick returning.
“He’s everything we thought he’d be and more,” Orgeron said. “[But] you can’t just focus on stopping him; there’s a lot of elements to that offense.”
By some standards, Thomas’ role as a tailback has been reduced a bit this year; his 499 rushing yards and seven touchdowns are second on the team behind Kenjon Barner’s 974 yards and 14 touchdowns.
But he ranks first on the team in receptions (24), and returned a punt 73 yards for a touchdown last week against Colorado, zigzagging across the width of the field and making defenders look silly.
USC sophomore Hayes Pullard, who attended Crenshaw High alongside Thomas, knows exactly how dangerous he can be.
“He’ll be outside at receiver, [inside] at running back,” Pullard said. “We just got to know where he is and think about the plays he can execute from where he is.”
Pullard says he communicates with his ex-teammate daily, and that Thomas and his new Oregon teammates have stepped up their trash talk since USC’s loss to Arizona last Saturday.
“They still throw it in our face about how we don’t have no [championship] hopes and stuff like that,” Pullard said. “But it’s all just playing around, that’s how we’ve been playing since Crenshaw. … We’re still going to be best friends until the end.”
USC fans hope that Pullard will put that friendship aside this Saturday — or else the Black Mamba could put more tooth marks on the Trojans’ season.

As of 2012, USC has compiled a 38-18-2 record against Oregon. Looking at the last few years, though, it’s easy to confuse the Ducks as the historically dominant program.
Searching for answers · Senior center Khaled Holmes (front) and junior guard John Martinez (back) look to anchor a struggling USC offense against a surging Duck defense. Oregon is outscoring opponents by an average of 34 points per game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Despite a 38-35 upset win from the Trojans in Autzen Stadium in 2011, No. 4 Oregon (8-0, 5-0) has dominated the Pac-12 for the better part of the last four seasons. In that time, Oregon coach Chip Kelly has led the squad to two Rose Bowls and an appearance in the BCS national championship game against Auburn in 2011.
“They know what they’re doing,” USC defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron said. “They’re really good -— [Kelly has] recruited well, coached well.”
No. 17 USC (6-2, 4-2), fresh off an upset loss at Arizona last weekend, is aware of just how good the Ducks are right now and appears motivated for its primetime matchup at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday.
“This is the best team in the country coming in,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They’ve blown everybody out by halftime. … We have to be ready, and I think our players are.”
The Ducks, who feature a quick-strike, hurry-up offense, have never had offensive problems under Kelly; they have averaged more than 40 points per game the last three seasons. The biggest difference in the Ducks this year, however, is their defense, which is yielding just 19.4 points per game.
“[Oregon has] a really physical defense,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “[They have defensive] ends who rush upfield and I think are some of the best players on their team. … They force a lot of turnovers, that defense. So it comes back to us protecting the ball.”
Ball security was one of the Trojans’ downfalls last Saturday in Tucson. USC turned the ball over five times and committed 13 penalties; as of now, the Trojans are the most penalized team in the entire country.
Mental mistakes have been a problem all season for the Trojans.
“We have to do a better job of making sure guys have the mentality of protecting the team,” Barkley said. “That’s the number one rule … If you’re making those mistakes you’re putting the team in harm’s way. So we just have to keep emphasizing that to the guys.”
Lost in the devastating upset was a record-setting performance by sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who caught 16 passes for a conference record of 345 yards against the Wildcats. Lee had a chance to catch a Hail Mary pass from Barkley as time expired, but was unable to come up with the circus catch. Fellow wideout junior Robert Woods is confident the close loss will not lead to a hangover against Oregon.
“I know a lot of guys have been waiting on this game,” Woods said. “We should have been playing well ahead of time just to get ready for this game. But hopefully we bring our ‘A’ game and it sparks the team up again.”
Though the Duck defense has improved this season, it is still their offense that gets the headlines, and rightfully so: Oregon averages 53.4 points per game, the highest clip in the country. They feature the nation’s No. 3 rushing offense, which is led by senior running back Kenjon Barner and sophomore sensation De’Anthony Thomas. Barner is No. 10 in the country in rushing yards while Thomas averages more than 8.5 yards a carry. Adding to the threat is redshirt freshman quarterback Marcus Mariota, whose dual threat capabilities have given defenses fits all season.
“The main thing is we have to play disciplined,” senior safety Jawanza Starling said. “They get a lot of their big plays because somebody on defense gets out of position or makes the wrong read and they hit it for big plays.”
The Ducks high-tempo offense is based on putting players in space before the defense has a chance to catch its breath. USC, which gave up 15 points to Oregon in the fourth quarter of last season’s thriller, knows just how crucial tackling players in the open field will be Saturday.
“[Oregon tries] to put us all in space, that’s why we try doing tackling drills,” sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “We’re going to play things slow. Just not try and be over aggressive, just trying to go get the running back … and the quarterback.”
Pullard, who finished with 14 tackles in last season’s meeting, also emphasized that the defense can’t commit penalties and give Oregon free yards.
“Every powerful offense thrives on explosion plays,” Pullard said. “So, the less of that, they actually have to earn every yard instead of a free 15 [yard penalty].”
The Trojans are aware this team is far different than last year’s Oregon squad. However, Kiffin believes that the ingredients to success remain the same.
“It will be just like last year,” Kiffin said. “You’re going to have to make those tackles in space. We did a really good job through three quarters last year of doing that. You saw a lot of plays out on the perimeter, and our outside backers and our DB’s made a lot of really good tackles in that game. We’re going to have to do the same again.”
Kickoff for USC’s matchup with Oregon is set for 4 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The game will be broadcast nationally on FOX.

The party was premoted to the greater LA area saying only you need a student ID or an ID showing you are 18+.  The University has no business hosting on campus parties for anyone other the current USC students.
Let’s think about this:
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, said university policy requires that on-campus student parties be open only to “guests with student IDs from USC or another university.”
1. so unauthorized guests may be in line and not identified as “unauthorized” until their identification is checked. well, in this instance, because of the extent of the line, there was no ability to check an ID.  hence anyone could still be on campus, waiting in line until turned away due to policy (if not a college student or without ID).
2. per policy, to be authorized to trespass on campus one needs to be a student at another university.  how does being a college student necessarily reduce the probability of an adverse event?  even if it is a student from USC, there may still exist “criminality.”  we can state that a student or a USC-student reduces the probability or events of crime but how has this been quantified?  what evidence is there other than superstition?
It would be great if we could think this through more before we enact “the next great police state,” evident and abounding throughout the US.
A FIDM/ CSULB/ LMU student passing out drunk at a party is enough “evidence” for the University to call Greek presidents into degrading meetings criticizing the bad bad image of the Row. What image is the BSA presenting with this occurrence? Can’t say! Racist! 
If 28th St is held accountable for the actions of non-students, so should the other organizations!
fully agree
But don’t forget that the USC admininstration sanctioned the event. They should have known better and heads should roll.
Meow!
This is what happens when you let local residents on campus
They were not local.
USC NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER. THIS IS A SECURITY ISSUE. FIX IT. PERIOD.
The event was USC sanctioned. Heads should roll.
PUT NIKIAS ON PROBATION!!
I am offended by how the Daily Trojan chose to lead this opinion by parroting a student’s comment: ‘Why do we let random ass ghetto people on campus?’  There is an issue here, but this using broad brush, hate-mongering language is not that way to constructively address the issues.
What the student was asking is a valid question. Why did we let the event promoter allow non-USC students to attend for a $30 fee. To me it seems like someone taking advantage of the university to make a quick buck and we need to hold organizations and individuals responsible: namely Michael Jackson and the BSA. Secondly, we need to cease allowing non-USC students access to the university until they prove they can be trusted. Its high time the university stuck up for our safety to the community.
I am more deeply frightened of the racists on campus than I am of anyone in our surrounding community.
Correct.
I am also scared of these people. We are all students! This is not a race issue! Open your minds Trojan Family.
“I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
The racists? Have there been any crimes committed by racists on campus to your knowledge? No, but there has been violent and evil community members murdering students in cold blood, and now engaging in violence on-campus. Your ignorance of the real perpetrators of violence is all too evident.
Maybe my fellow Trojans don’t read the news: people–most often students or university employees who are not black–often shoot people on campuses. Whether at a party or whether the target is a professor, nationally the vast majority of these shootings are by university accepted students or employees. Anyone with a gun can open fire on anyone and security would be lucky to be at the right place and time to respond. I have been on campus and in the surrounding area since 1975 and have never felt unsafe. One shooter at a party is no indication that USC is unsafe. It is an indication that one person was off his /her rocker to even have the gun at a party in the first place!
How can people say it is anybody’s fault for this shooting. Everybody knows the area is not safe. Party, or no party, violence happens around here and it should be no surprise. There are definitely things that could be done to help these types of issues. But to say it is irresponsible to invite non USC students is a bit ignorant. People are people, and USC is a huge campus with a big population. I understand school pride, but to think or expect USC students are completely incapable of committing such a crime is just annoying. It’s like how a mother would never believe her child could do such a horrible thing just because its her child, even if he or she did. I guess the fingers have to be pointed at someeeebody. But maybe there should be rules then. It’s not like whoever organized this event would think they were breaking the rules when making this invite. Maybe the school should be responsible, the adults, administration. Who is to say. This is a huge and popular school in the middle of freakin Los Angeles.
The Black Students Association is primarily responsible for this awful tragedy.  USC should put them on probation for behaving in an irresponsible manner by inviting non USC students to a nightclub like event. This is USC, not some trashy venue.  Had Sigma Chi hosted such an event, they’d be on probation by now.
fully agree.  and in response to the first comment “‘Why do we let random ass ghetto people on campus?’ I read [that question] on Facebook, and I’ve been crying all day.  I don’t want to be on a campus where this type of stuff is said following an event where people could have died.” by margarett winn, I think we need to ask this type of question.  it is not racist to ask why a student organization invited non students to campus.
if a greek organization invited non-students to an event, leading to a shooting by said non-students, the whole row would go on probation in 5 minutes.

The events leading up to Wednesday night’s shooting can only be described with one phrase: playing with fire.
The shooting occurred outside “Freak or Greek,” a Halloween party held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The event was promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly, a division of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board. Though USC said non-students were not allowed to attend the party, the opposite stands true: Students at the party reported that many of the attendees were not college students.
The promoters marketed “Freak or Greek” as a party for everyone in Los Angeles, student or otherwise. According to tweets by party promoters, USC students could attend the party, but non-USC attendees were charged varying sums of money to enter the party. One promoter went so far as to tweet that “weird dudes who don’t belong” could attend — if they paid $30. Furthermore, an event page encouraged attendees to “PreGame before the party” because they would be cited if any “substances” were brought on campus.
Simply put, it was outright reckless for the university to allow an outside company to host an on-campus party for individuals who do not attend USC.
This lack of discretion is nothing short of inappropriate, and the groups hosting the event should have better understood that allowing large numbers of non-college, non-USC individuals to attend an on-campus party could create problems. The event not only exploited USC and its resources to make money off outside individuals, but also inadvertently put students — students who perceive the campus as a place of safety and proper enforcement — at risk of injury and even death.
The event’s shameless and inappropriate promotion demonstrates an unsettling lack of judgment and oversight on behalf of the university and the organizations co-hosting the party. Moving forward, it is essential for USC to carefully study and revise its policies on event sponsorship — or face even more dire consequences.

Nikias must step down instead of hiding like a child. We need leadership not excuses.
Below from Neon Tommy:
“After numerous calls—and in-person requests—for comment to university officials, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent the media an email saying the following:
“…The event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween.”
It is clear, then, that the event was reviewed and approved by USC. It is imperative the University disclose all aspects of the review process. Though it appears to have been removed from the internet, videos of LA Hype at a prior USC party had been available for USC’s review prior to granting the policy exemption. In the interest of  USC transparency and fair disclosure, these videos should be secured and made available to every parent and trustee. Bottom line (no pun intended) the theme of booty on crotch is thoroughly explored in the video among other behaviors likely to be viewed as offensive.
I am not making a censorship or moral statement, but pointing out those who had responsibility to consider an exemption for a party on a weeknight after 10, with the most basic due diligence, could have secured much vivid information regarding the nature of the proposed event and the promoter. It remains imperative that President Nikias, Mr. Jackson and anyone else from USC admin responsible secure and view the video before framing their response and consequences for themselves and others.
The existing USC weeknight policy would have more than been sufficient to decline an exemption for this promoter and party, if a minimum due diligence had been conducted before apparently “rubber stamping”  “Approved”. The comments by Mr. Jackson that he approved the exemption to USC policy because he wanted to provide our students with a Halloween celebration falls flat given that the candy evident from the video of a prior LA hype event  was solely eye candy, much of it unwrapped–I could go on with the metaphor. I don’t see how any USC administrator could defend this particular event as appropriate for Halloween at the Tutor Center and not have concerns for potential safety issues. 
Mr. Jackson’s statement, “This incident reminds us that we must look out for ourselves and be particularly vigilant about the personal safety of friends and guests at our social events,” is a particularly vexing platitude as in this case it is the USC admins who did not look out for our students. I am not condoning the poor judgement of the BSA or any other students or student groups involved in the party planning process. I do view college as a learning experience. There is a role and responsibility carved out for party approval and direction by the administration. In this case, the process and administration failed with severe consequences for many. Perhaps most worrisome is the absence of an apology and acknowledgement of inadequate performance by those USC personnel, from President Nikias on down, who bear responsibility.
If Michael Jackson approved the exemption, then he must resign or be fired, period.  Four people were shot in the heart of campus and USC’s reputation has been gravely damaged. His casual lack of personal responsibility in this matter is very disturbing.
Right on!
Here’s the thing: Jackson’s statement is a lie.
Please explain what you mean.
Jackson’s statement that “…[t]he event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween” is untrue. “[A]pproved as an exception” implies that someone noticed that it violated the rules and then allowed it to go on anyway. Let’s just say that didn’t happen.
I read a tiny article in the L A TImes today that a 19 year old security guard with a valid gun license had been arrested in Inglewood. So please stop maligning the North University Park community.
I malign nothing. That said, your community is awful, and, had I been as intimately familiar with it as I am now when I was considering which university to attend, I never would have come to USC. Give it up and leave, already—you’re fighting a losing battle and, at the end of the day, there is nothing all that spectacular for you to defend.
If anything Twan, you’re the bigot and ignorant fool. Not only have you been commenting on this post, but you have been going to every story that the DT has posted making totally outlandish comments and spreading racially charged comments. I have not seen one person here or on any other post use race to justify the penalties that should be carried out as a result of the shooting. It is my sincere hope that you are in fact not related to this institution in any way because it would truly be a poor reflection of the education that you should have received at this institution. To come back and comment with another ignorant remark would only further substantiate my claim. So please, prove me right.
Bravo… the only racist commentary has come from TWAN. Any individual or group that tarnishes the USC image and the Trojan Family in this manner needs to be held accountable. I can think of a few former student-athletes that might be able to attest to that….
The bigotry you all enjoy must be intoxicating.  Oh, you gonna get rid of the BSA and Obama all in one week!  Hallelujah!
They may go but I am not!
are you twan- as in the party promoter? if so, shame on you.
Because my name is Twan and I am a young African American, I must be the party promoter. Following your ridiculous logic, I guess I must be the shooter and the victim as well because we are all young black men. You people with your righteous indignation makes me sick. While all these lily white parents blame USC and the BSA for what happened no one seems to blame the shooter and the gun. He snuck the gun on campus and he shot those people. USC didn’t shoot anyone and neither did the BSA. Those are the facts!
Why are there so many guns?
How come an 18 year old can buy a gun on the street?
Why does that same individual feel he needs a gun?
The answer here is simple: Money, Crime, Fear and Poverty.
You collect the money while we live in poverty fearing crime. Welcome to my neighborhood!
This is the society you people created and we must live in.
Congratulations, your experiment has failed!
Lastly, I love all you people calling me out as a racist because I defend the BSA. You all hiding behind your keyboard. Not one of you could say to my face anything you have written about me. You are all cowards!
Please. Noone on this board knew anything about your ethnicity or background, all we know is that you were and still are not seeing the light that had any other on-campus group broken policy, as the BSA did, they would be held accountable.
The BSA and its leadership should be held accountable and reprimanded. You should consider being more open minded and stop being such a racist. 
The only coward is you; and, yes, I would say that to your face.
Prove me wrong and meet me at the fountain in front of Doheny at 6pm tonight.  I’m wearing a black track suit with cardinal trim.  Call me a coward for defending my people.
I was there with my friends, DPS and a camera man and Senior NoShowTwan did just that…. No Showed!
The BSA should be placed on probation and/or disbanded immediately because of this disaster. But because they’re a black organization, nothing is going to happen–USC will crack down on the Greek system because most of its members are white, but they won’t touch the BSA for fear of being accused of racism.
So what is your recommendation, DT? I hope it’s not 1982 alumnus’ strategy: point fingers and force student groups to wait 3-6 weeks while lawyers review their party plans. 
I think it’s a mistake to act like this incident is much more than an act of extreme stupidity by the gunman. There are parties and “nightclub events” like these every day in Los Angeles, and a shooting on the sidewalk outside is hardly commonplace.
I love the double standard placed here. Greek row gets absolutely screwed over for trouble caused by non USC students *cough FIDM cough*, while the BSA gets nothing. Just because they’re a club doesn’t mean they can get away with literally murder. Any organization should be held accountable for this kind of incident, regardless of status.
I agree with Mom that the USC Administration and BSA were grossly negligent in sponsoring and permitting such a nightclub or “rave” event to take place in the center of campus.  As an attorney who has represented a nightclub owner, I am well aware of the risks posed by nightclubs, including underage drinking, fisticuffs, rowdy behavior and violence.  At a minimum, any nightclub requires extra security, including bouncers, chaperones, security guards, and police.  Even with such precautions violence is an unavoidable part of the business.  The naiveté demonstrated by the USC administration is as shocking as it is pathetic, and no platitudes from President Nikias can excuse their gross negligence, particularly on a night that is generally referred to as “mischief night.”  This was a completely avoidable incident.  The news has hit virtually all major news outlets in the world, and the damage to USC’s reputation is incalculable at this point.  This is what I recommend be done immediately:  1) ban all nightclub events on the USC campus; 2) require all student organizations to submit to the Office of General Counsel for legal review all contracts involving such events sponsored by USC and its student groups; 3) place the BSA on probation to send a clear message that its leadership was wrong and irresponsible for encouraging non-students to attend the nightclub (including any violations of existing USC policies); 4)  fire, demote and/or discipline the administrators (and lawyers) who signed-off on the nightclub event at Tutor Hall; 5) host a town-hall-like meeting of all student group leaders and the USC administration to discuss and address the great risks imposed by hosting this type of event on and around campus; and 6) increase the security presence on the USC campus now and for the immediate future to assuage student and parent anxiety.  Four people were shot on our beloved campus, an unprecedented tragedy.
Well said, 1982 alumnas.
Heads should roll.
Unfortunately, it is not just USC’s reputation that will be tarnished. Invariably the neighborhoods close to USC will be blamed although the miscreants came from far afield.
Why has the BSA remained silent on this? I want a countdown to the number of days it takes for the BSA to publicly comment on this situation. Just because you are a black organization does not mean you get to hide behind some unspoken politically correct shield that makes whitey look racist if you call out a black person for what is truly thug ghetto behavior. Do we want to get to the root of the problem or do we want to dance around the issue and be apologists just because the shooter was black.
The only racist commenting on this article is TWAN. Shame on TWAN. Grow up.
The BSA should answer for their actions just as any other on-campus body would have to. For the President of the University to not hold them accountable would be reprehensible. 
DAMIEN, maybe TWAN can find you a job considering he/she seems to have all of the answers.
As a Trojan mom of 2, I am furious that this kind of event was allowed and your editorial is quite restrained. I don’t care what organization (and its ethnicity) was the host. It does not matter. USC should not allow itself to be used as a nightclub for outsiders. President Nikias’s address was quite lame and condescending as well. How dare he tell my sons to be vigilant about their personal safety when they have no control over the university environment.  Isn’t their safety his job? He and the administrators involved failed every Trojan parent and student by allowing this event.
“Isn’t their safety his job?”
No. Your children are no longer children. They are adults.
I had a job interview yesterday and the only comment made about USC on my resume was “did you see the shooting yesterday”.  Despicable this is what comes to mind.  Glad I spent 250k for that kind of academic credence.
Here is a great idea…Lets invite 1500 18-22 year olds from one of the nation’s most dangerous neighborhoods to the center of a major academic institution on a schoolnight.  No mention of race in that sentence.  Next lets discuss that you need to be 21 to be at that venue and considering that we know one of the victims was a freshman clearly we know thats not the case.  USC wasn’t checking IDs to drink and they sure as heck weren’t checking school IDs.  This is gross negligance.  It sounds like an all out free for all in the CENTER OF CAMPUS sanctioned by the school.  DPS Chief should be replaced.  Nikias should be put on watch.  BSA should be disbanned.  YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS AT A RESPECTABLE INSTITUTION.
Herman,
Come out and say what you mean.  Young black men that don’t play sports stay away from USC!
I’d say the same thing about inviting 1500 drunk white kids from community college or no college at all to party on campus too. This is a private university.  Keep low-lives away.
Great writing Mimi and a spot-on assessment.
Whoops sorry – great writing: Elena Kadvany, Nicholas Slayton, Jennifer Schultz, Eddie Kim, Joey Kaufman and Sean Fitz-Gerald.
I’m curious if the university really needs to reform the policy itself. The policy says that students from other universities can attend sanctioned events with a university ID. There just should have been DPS at the door checking the IDs instead of some random person. Also, since the shooting happened outside, there’s no guarantee that would have prevented it either. I don’t think it’s a negative look on the University, as the event at its core was a very fine event: a sober Halloween party, within the safety of DPS and the university gates. It is the promoters and the BSA that should be in trouble for handling promotion of the party the way they did, effectively working around university policies meant to keep bad things from happening. In the end, however, there’s just no way to prevent some bozo (even if it were a USC-only function) from bringing a weapon and doing something stupid on campus. There’s only education and vigilance.
Great editorial. Bang on.
Great article. Thank you “daily trojan” for being the voice of the student body. The school seems to be skirting around the facts which are- this was a HIGHLY publicly promoted event. The organizers “LA Hype” were taking advantage of USC and luring random people, for profit, that created an unsafe atmosphere for everyone.Its not like this was happening behind closed doors. Its not about more security, its the enforcement of policy that could have prevented this to begin with.
It saddens me that the BSA is included in this, but race is IRRELEVANT. If this was a fraternity house, they would have to answer too, as should the BSA. Its about the safety of the ENTIRE student body. Hopefully this is a wake up call to ALL student organizations and school officials.
The Black Students Association is primarily responsible for allowing such an event to take place and the consequential shootings, knowing full well that non-USC students would attend or be encouraged to attend the USC “nightclub” on campus.  USC needs to treat the BSA like any other student organization, such as and including a fraternity, and place the BSA on probation NOW.  USC is not a trashy, Westwood-like nightclub, and the BSA needs to be reminded of who they represent.  Their student leaders demonstrated supreme irresponsibility, immaturity and a profound lack of judgment in transforming USC’s venerable Tudor venue into a low-life nightclub.  Just as culpable are the USC administrators who sanctioned such a nightclub-like event.  What were they thinking?  If you create a nightclub in the middle of campus, knowing that non-USC students more likely than not will attend, what do you expect?  Where were the “adults” in this decision-making process?  If you wanted to create nightclub on campus, where was the security, the bouncers, and more importantly, where was the USC General Counsel in the decision-making process; wait, don’t tell me, at the Latham & Watkins box at Staples????
The story covers the facts. Would it be racist if “Black Student Assembly” was replaced with “(name any other organization)”? What happened and the news coverage afterward have NOTHING to do with skin color. It’s about the safety of ALL students! Let’s focus on the real issues at hand – university violating its’ own policies, invitations via social media inviting the public toand student events on campus, and ultimately how the USC admininstration takes handles the aftermath to ensure the safety of our students in the future. No exceptions!
You make this sound like a black problem
Can we cut the race crap, please? It was a tragedy that exposed a policy flaw, not an indictment of a group of people.
And please don’t bother retorting with race garbage. I’m only here to promote a more productive and interesting dialogue. I won’t bother with any more of your thoughts if they aren’t garbage.
*are
Both USC and the BSA need to answer for this, and not through a vague, half-assed reassurance letter. There is a problem here, and it’s not going away this time – count on it. It better not be that the only change is to the policy.
This.

Information, in many ways, can be either constructive or hazardous, as demonstrated by Wednesday night’s online reaction to news of the shooting at the heart of USC’s University Park Campus.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
What transpired is now clear: A gunman wounded four non-USC students, one critically, while waiting in line for a Halloween party held in the ballroom of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Approximately two hours later, the Dept. of Public Safety announced that the suspect had been taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department.
The online response to the incident demonstrated how social media websites, such as Twitter, Facebook and others, allow people to share news as fast as possible, especially in cases of crime. No other platforms stand capable of providing information mere seconds after news breaks. So social media undoubtedly played an important role Wednesday night by informing students, parents and others affiliated with the university that a shooting had taken place on campus.
This publication sought to do the same. Within 10 minutes of hearing gunshots on Trousdale Parkway, we confirmed with DPS officials on the scene that gunshots had in fact been fired. And for the remainder of the evening, the Daily Trojan’s reporters made efforts to share, largely via social media, whatever updates officials and sources could confirm. Other student media outlets, in addition to the Los Angeles Times, were on hand to do the same.
But as beneficial as websites like Twitter can prove to be, the perils of social media and rushed reporting also reared their ugly heads on Wednesday night.
The online conversation in the immediate aftermath of the shooting proved to be flooded with inaccuracies as a result of haste and a seemingly never-ending desire to break news first without necessarily being accurate.
Before law enforcement confirmed two suspects had been apprehended, several students tweeted about the suspects’ whereabouts. Some suggested a gunman had been arrested or was still at large at varying locations. One journalism student from Annenberg, meanwhile, claimed the gunman was located on the third floor of the campus center. This eventually evolved into a rumor that the shooter was on the third floor of the Student Union building, just below the Daily Trojan’s offices. As you might gather, this became slightly unnerving for several DT editors, myself included, and staff members who stayed in the Student Union as part of an effort to finish production for this newspaper’s Thursday print edition, as well as provide updates regarding the shooting.
The reporter’s tweet was later deleted after they apologized, admitting it was “inaccurate.”
Though the spread of misinformation appears largely harmless in this instance,  it still has the power to risk the safety of students. What would have happened, for instance, if publications had reported that the gunman was taken into custody when he or she instead was at large, roaming the campus? Would students have viewed that as indication that the scene was clear or safe, when the contrary would have been true?
To USC’s own credit, the university was particularly responsive in the wake of the shooting, providing consistent, accurate and up-to-date information. Just 15 minutes after gunshots were heard, DPS issued a Trojan Alert reporting the latest development. And it later issued four subsequent alerts over the next four hours before reopening campus early Thursday morning.
In today’s Internet-driven environment, it’s essential for reporters and citizen journalists to strike the proper balance between speed and accuracy, especially in situations as grave as what happened on campus this Halloween.
Finding this balance is not always easy. But regardless, we must continue to be increasingly aware of the implications of our decisions, especially as technology enables us to disseminate information more and more quickly.
 
Joey Kaufman is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism and religion, and is the Daily Trojan’s managing editor.
How do you figure 15 minutes after the shooting? Also, keep in mind, DPS had apparently arrested the two suspects at the time this first alert went out. At 12:30, @USC warned students to stay inside and keep doors locked, creating a panic of a loose gunman. This could have been horrendous; the fact that it was not does not excuse a slow, inaccurate response by USC officials. Also — though the arrest happened early, students were kept in a state of panic until after 2:30 a.m. — three hours after the event.
There’s a lot more important things than a university being speedy to respond, but USC shouldn’t be bragging about a fast response when it was slow and sloppy.
The DT also reported recently that it was a BSA event along with LA Hype. This is an inaccurate association because it was NOT a BSA event. Please look into that DT.
Stealing my name… you’re an idiot. BSA was the group that filed the paperwork with the university for the event. And their president put out a statement about it.
They might have issued an alert fifteen minutes after it happened, but it took about thirty for most people to get the email about it. They need a new vendor or a faster email system.
[…] shooting on the USC campus, the trope encompassed an especially egregious Twitter turn. Per an an op ed in The Daily Trojan by Joey Kaufman: One journalism student from Annenberg claimed the gunman was […]

Many people have a difficult time accepting that women participate in contact sports. Perhaps because of that, female sports, especially those in the “contact” category, are rarely mentioned in media. When was the last time a newspaper had a feature on women’s lacrosse? How often does the WNBA appear on TV? Women’s soccer? Tackle football?
Derby dames · Though the 2009 film Whip It called attention to women’s roller derby, many L.A. teams keep the sport alive today. – | Photo courtesy of Jess Reynolds
Nevertheless, girls are joining contact sports teams in greater numbers. In the case of roller derby, they dominate. And with the L.A. Derby Dolls, the local league comprising five women’s teams, competing in their championship game this Saturday, it’s time to give attention to the sport.
Roller derby was at its most popular in the 1940s, when professional roller derby had upwards of five million viewers in over 50 U.S. cities. It soon became, however, more about entertainment than actual sport: Theatrics took precedence over sportsmanship, and the derby eventually faded away.
Then, in the 1990s, roller derby was reincarnated. Today, there are now a few male and mixed teams scattered throughout the country. Women, however, are still the main players.
The L.A. Derby Dolls consists of five all-female teams: Fight Crew, Sirens Roller Derby Squad, Tough Cookies, Varsity Brawlers and the all-star team, the LA Ri-Ettes. Founded in October 2003, it’s one of only 13 leagues that compete on a banked track, which offers players a unique challenge.
Laci Knight  (aka Lace N’ Arsenic), head coach of the LA Ri-ettes, head of the L.A. Derby Dolls Training Team and co-captain of the Varsity Brawlers, said, “I think women have become the primary players because it became something we could own and control. No other sport has ever been originated by women; it was men’s first and then women came in and started playing. This, however, became something that was ours first.”
Only about one decade old, the modern form of the sport is still in its amateur phase: It needs more time to perfect its rules and the game itself. Regardless, the sport is growing.
Alex Cohen, co-author of Down and Derby: The Insider’s Guide to Roller Derby, former L.A. Derby Doll skater and choreographer and consultant for the film Whip It, said, “I would say all skaters take the sport quite seriously, as professionals do. But most derby skaters care most about the sport and aren’t in it for the money, which is why so many thousands of women are happy to skate, even if it’s an amateur sport.”
Modern roller derby is often stereotyped as simply a violent race among punk rock girls. The reality of the game, however, is much more complicated. Each game, or bout, consists of multiple jams, or mini races, where the jammer — the designated point scorer — must lap around the opposing team. It is a multifaceted sport with an emphasis on teamwork and community with a do-it-yourself attitude.
Roller derby skated into pop culture with the 2009 film Whip It, which portrays a young teen finding her calling at a local derby league. Though the film was not completely accurate — mainly in respect to the rules and the number of teammates -— it still displays the emotion of the sport.
On such error includes the rules of the game. Each roller derby league has variations on the rules — The L.A. Derby Dolls their own 35-page rulebook — but despite these differences, details on legal and illegal moves often overlap. Even with a guidebook, roller derby is a contact sport, so injuries are inevitable and brutal. Certain moves, such as fighting, tripping and elbowing are always illegal. Additionally, the number of teammates on the bench is usually around 15, as opposed to the small number in the film.
Ignoring these technicalities, Whip It does a great job showing the dynamics of derby athletes.
“The film captures a lot about derby — the spirit, the camaraderie, the DIY aspect of the sport,” Cohen said.
Similar to the way the Hurl Scouts and Holy Rollers organize their bouts in Whip It, the leagues organize every facet of the sport themselves.
“We train ourselves, manage our bouts and run the league,” Knight said.
This DIY attitude no doubt stems from the third-wave feminist attitude often attributed to derby girls. In a nutshell, third wave feminism emphasizes the empowerment and equality of all women from all races and sexual identities. Most importantly, it doesn’t have one solid philosophy, keeping itself open to change as culture grows.
But the Derby Dolls  league also take a more direct route in spreading their female-empowerment philosophies. From raising money for the AIDS walk to hosting junior derby camps for young girls, the Derby Dolls give back to the L.A. community.
The junior derby focuses on female empowerment, physical fitness and teamwork. The weeklong camp not only trains the girls in the sport, but also gets them involved. The girls raised more than $2,000 for Los Angeles Children’s Hospital in a double-header fundraiser bout back in April 2011.
With the way the Derby Dolls members put their own spin on female empowerment and teach young girls the meaning of true athleticism, it’s clear that badass girls and women will be battling for victory for years to come.
 
The L.A. Derby Dolls compete at the Doll Factory. Doors will open at 6 p.m. for the championship game.

This week unquestionably saw the biggest entertainment news of the year with the announcement that Disney bought Lucasfilm for the blockbuster-worthy sum of $4.05 billion. The deal has plenty of long-lasting, far-reaching implications, but the vast majority of them have to do with one simple fact: From this day forward, the Mouse owns Star Wars.
No, these are not just rights to keep their Star Tours attraction up and running in Tomorrowland. We’re talking about the whole franchise here. Every movie, character and piece of merchandise from perhaps the most lucrative intellectual property in history is owned, from this point forward, by the house that Walt built. And they have no intention of letting it go to waste.
On the contrary, they’re going to release Star Wars Episode VII in 2015. Yes, that does require repeating. In three years or less, there will be a new, full-fledged Star Wars film in theaters. In terms of shifts in the pop-culture paradigm, it doesn’t get any bigger than that.
Many fans — and when it comes to Star Wars, practically everyone is a fan, if only through osmosis — expressed initial dismay that the series will be further tarnished, an already over beaten horse reduced to a fine pulp. But they’re missing the big picture.
The prequels were, well, less than what people had hoped for almost entirely because of the overbearing presence of George Lucas, who wrote and directed each film with a level of absolute control that ensured his vision made it onscreen. It just so happened to turn out that the original trilogy was classic stuff — perhaps because of the difficult conditions and creative compromises that surrounded its making, not in spite of them.
But whomever’s to blame, it didn’t matter much because Lucas made it very clear that he had no interest in directing or producing any more Star Wars films. Considering his word on the franchise had always been law, there was no reason to think that someone would attempt to continue the series for perhaps decades to come.
Well, it would appear even George Lucas couldn’t say no to $4 billion.
“It’s now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of filmmakers,” Lucas said in the initial announcement, and he’s backing that up by ceding the Lucasfilm presidency and Star Wars brand management onto producer extraordinaire Kathleen Kennedy. Lucas is moving toward retirement, which means it’s finally time for a fresh group of creators to see what they can do with a galaxy far, far away.
Though it would normally be more than a little troubling to hear about media consolidation on such a grand scale, the truth is that Star Wars will never be more stagnant than it was under Lucas’ total control. With Lucasfilm and Disney now working together to produce new content, there’s a fair chance that Star Wars could be genuinely good again. And regardless of the quality, the quantity that Disney has planned is staggering. They’ve announced that beyond a sequel trilogy taking fans through Episode IX, they’ll continue to release a Star Wars film every two or three years for the foreseeable future.
It’s a massive undertaking that calls to mind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which also falls firmly under the Disney umbrella ever since they acquired the comic book behemoth in 2009 in a deal much like this one.
At their most optimistic, fans are wondering if Disney’s plans for Star Wars could turn out as well as they did with The Avengers. Maybe Joss Whedon would even want to direct a Star Wars movie. Why not? And at their most ridiculous, fans are wondering if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes could cross Universes and join the Rebel Alliance. Ridiculous and impossible, sure, but don’t act like it wouldn’t sell tickets.
That’s not to say these new Star Wars films are guaranteed to hit home. It pays to remember how badly Disney botched John Carter last year. But in a way, that doesn’t matter at the moment. No one knows anything concrete about Episode VII or beyond at this early in the game. But in a way, the quality is hardly the point. What Disney’s done already is something that no one could have predicted: They made Star Wars relevant again.
The Disney-Lucasfilm buyout is the topic of discussion among anyone who cares even slightly about what goes on in the movie-making world, and it will be for years to come as millions of fans scrutinize, criticize and celebrate every word from Disney and Lucasfilm in regards to how they’re handling this massively important enterprise. The questions are already flying fast (Who might be involved? Will Pixar animate a Star Wars movie? Does this mean Leia is now a Disney princess?) and they’re not going to stop so long as there’s more Star Wars on the horizon. Knowing Disney, there always will be. A week ago it would have been horribly cheesy to say this, and maybe it still is, but they’ve earned it regardless: May the Force be with them.

Dear Disney and LucasFilm,
Congratulations! You now possess the power of the force and with it comes a great deal of responsibility. So here’s what you’re going to do: 
STEP 1 – you’re going to set the new films (Episode 7, 8 and 9) 30 years after episode 6 (Jedi) and you’re going to have the FULL original cast back playing themselves as older people. DID YOU HEAR ME? You are going to cast Harrison Ford as Han Freaking solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Billy Dee Williams as Lando and even Denis Lawson back as Wedge Antilles. HERE’S THE CATCH: THEY DON’T HAVE TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTERS. They are older now and you can use them as side characters revolving around NEW lead characters. We don’t care what new characters take over leading roles but you HAVE to bring back the old cast for this all to be LEGIT and to come FULL circle. PLEASE don’t cast new actors in these roles and don’t CGI faces to make them look like the actors 30 years ago (Like in Tron Legacy) PLEASE!!! You can even kill them off in the first scene, just don’t replace them. 
STEP 2 – DON’T LISTEN TO ANYTHING GEORGE LUCAS SAYS! You paid him $4 Billion so tell him to shut up take his money and go make Radioland Murders Part 2! Put somebody in charge of directing who knows what we want. WE WANT EMPIRE STRIKES BACK ON CRACK. That means ACTING, ACTING, ACTING, ACTING, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, DRAMA, DEATH!!!!! 
STEP 3 – Whatever you did to make AVENGERS as good as it was, do the same for STAR WARS! I feel the force is strong with you and your company can pull this off. The prequels were the worst films EVER MADE! They showed us just how evil the dark side of the force can be when it seduced George Lucas and took over his ability to distinguish right from wrong! Please redeem the Star Wars Universe. DO OR DO NOT…THERE IS NO TRY
Sincerely,
Geeks

More than 100 years ago, J.M. Barrie captured the hearts and minds of audiences with a story about a boy who would not grow up.
Now, Zach Kaufer, a senior majoring in theatre, is directing his own adaptation of Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, which premiered Thursday night.
Faith, trust and sawdust · Philip Labes stars as Peter Pan in senior Zach Kaufer’s production Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up. The play is a modern spin on the classic J.M. Barrie tale. – Jacqueline Mansky | Daily Trojan
During winter break of his first semester of college, Kaufer picked up a copy of the original novel at his local Barnes and Noble. He read it in an hour and found himself enthralled with the story.
“What really interested me … was the adventure of it,” Kaufer said. “I was a freshman starting college, so the adventure was ahead of me.”
The project stayed on the backburner for some time. Kaufer created a “Peter Pan” folder on his computer, and whenever he saw a relevant picture or article, he simply added it to the folder. As time passed, the folder got larger, but the project  remained abstract.
“It became this huge project, and when you work on so long on something, it becomes daunting,” Kaufer said.
This Jan. 1, however, Kaufer finally applied for the rights to the show. From there, he carefully selected his crew, starting with his long time co-collaborator Victoria Tam, a senior majoring in theatre set design. Kaufer then applied for theater space for the production through the School of Dramatic Arts.
The Woodland Hills native said that the play, his fourth as a director at USC, is by far the most personal for him because it has evolved with him from the first pages of his college experience to the last chapter.
Many things have changed in Kaufer’s life since that night in Barnes and Noble. Now a senior set to graduate early in December, Kaufer remarked that he can’t help but see the story from the point of view of someone nearing the end of an adventure.
“[In the play] I’m looking at what is it that we take from our past in order to move forward into our future,” Kaufer said. “I think that is so perfect because for me, [there are] millions of adventures to come, but this particular one has ended.”
Kaufer found viewer’s ability to relate to the story most fascinating.
“The story evolves from person to person, age that changes it, gender that changes it, all these different factors change your view on the story,” Kaufer said.
In Kaufer’s adaptation, the play is set in the modern day and the story revolves around the life of the narrator, a 22-year-old artist living in London’s East End. The original play imagines the narrator as an older man, in the image of J.M. Barrie.
“By having someone younger, you see that person go through that journey — and immediately the story takes on that different light by having someone talk about the adventure before the adventure, as opposed to after that adventure,” Kaufer said. “Without changing a single word, instantly we get the more playful, youthful tone, and it just supports the idea that the story is so universal.”
The narrator’s studio will serve as the set. Kaufer and the production team wanted to tell the story using everyday objects, as with a ladder that serves as a mast on Captain Hook’s pirate ship, to make Neverland come to life.
“The set is really minimal; we use trunks, chairs, ropes, paint brushes, all these things to create different sets, scenes, props,” Kaufer said. “It’s really about imagination and play and using everyday objects to create all of these different places.”
Kaufer said that he hopes the audience takes away a new appreciation of the story from the play.
“It’s such a complex story that’s been so simplified in the musical adaptation and the Disney story,” Kaufer said. “There’s so much more to it, so many layers. I hope everyone [who] comes to see it takes something different from it, whether it’s how we move forward with our past, or accept the future or accept adventure and saying yes to things.”
Perhaps its appropriate, then, that Kaufer, who sports a Peter Pan iPhone cover and carries a messenger bag depicting Peter taking Wendy and her brothers to Neverland, plans to move to New York to pursue directing and production after graduation. He knows that his next adventure will soon be starting, and he recognizes that the play has provided him with new perspectives on his past and future.
“I hope that everyone watching will be able to see the beauty and the pain of growing up, and the importance [of] moving forward with your life, while not forgetting the past and how the past is able to put you forward,” Kaufer said.
 
Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up will be playing Friday at 7:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. at the Massman Theatre in the Drama Center.
What wonderful insight. Way to go Zach. Great write up. Fantastic concept.

A trio of Trojans were nominated for awards this week. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee were named semifinalists for the 76th Maxwell Award, and senior defensive back T.J. McDonald was named one of 15 semifinalists for the 2012 Jim Thorpe Award for the nation’s top defensive back.
McDonald is one of three Pac-12 players nominated for the Jim Thorpe Award. Oregon’s Ifo Ekpre-Olomu and Oregon State’s Jordan Poyer were also chosen. McDonald leads the team with 66 tackles, and has three pass deflections, an interception and a blocked field goal this season. He was also named a semifinalist in 2011. The last two winners—Morris Claiborne and Patrick Peterson—were both first-round picks in the NFL from LSU.
Three finalists for the Thorpe Award will be announced on Nov. 19. The winner will chosen on Dec. 6 and honored at a banquet on Feb. 5, 2013.
Barkley and Lee are two of five Pac-12 players nominated for the Maxwell Award, with the others being UCLA running back Johnathan Franklin, Oregon running back Kenjon Barner, and Oregon wide receiver/running back De’Anthony Thomas. Barkley is the only repeat nomination on the list, having completed 65.3% of his passes for 2266 yards with 25 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He currently owns the school and Pac-12 record for most touchdown passes with 105. Marqise Lee has 76 receptions for 1129 yards and 10 touchdowns.

Statistically, every student on campus knows someone affected by domestic violence, regardless of whether or not they are aware of it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four women nationally will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime, the majority of them between the ages of 18 and 24.
As Domestic Violence Awareness (DVA) Month, nears to a close, it is important to evaluate the successes and failures of the DVA movement both on campus and nationwide. While USC’s student organizations do a good job raising awareness, a focus on responding to domestic violence rather than preventing it before it happens detracts from the movement as a whole.
The USC Center for Women and Men and the Alpha Chi Omega and Omega Phi Beta sororities raised funds for the movement throughout the month of October. The majority, however, goes exclusively toward resources that help women get out of abusive relationships.
While these services are of the utmost importance, more attention should be directed to preventing abuse from happening.
Few organizations, for example, are dedicated to mentoring young boys. Domestic violence is self-perpetuating: children who grow up in abusive households are much more likely to be abusive or abused in relationships as adults. Mentorship is crucial to avoid this continued cycle of violence.
Increased efforts must also be made to involve more men in the fight against domestic violence. At a candlelight vigil hosted by Alpha Chi Omega on Thursday, speakers lauded the few men in the audience, acknowledging how rare it was to see them there.
However, since men are far more likely to be abusive than women, it is absolutely essential that they join the conversation. The current lack of male involvement sends a message to perpetrators of sexual violence—who already do not adequately respect women—that women’s efforts to end domestic violence do not deserve male esteem or support.
Domestic violence remains an extremely common problem among the college-age demographic. It is thus imperative that students take action on this serious issue and support preventative measures that in the past may have been overlooked.

There are times when you’re taking a jog around campus and you happen to run into the person you spent last  night with — or at least wish you had. Dripping with sweat and gasping for breath, you inevitably regret wearing your ugly, oversized T-shirt that isn’t appropriate for any other situation.
Although you can’t change the flushed cheeks, damp complexion and exhausted expression, you can at least improve what exercise clothes you choose to sport.
Nike offers a fashion-forward look that you can trade your frumpy workout attire for. Their neon line of workout clothes and shoes is a perfect way to exercise in style, but be careful not to over-wear the bright colors because that could be just as frightening as the T-shirt previously mentioned.
An added bonus for shopping at Nike is NIKEiD, which allows you to design your shoe from its color to its shape. You can also make your shoes unique by adding a personalized engraving.
Working out might be a draining activity, but make sure your clothes also stay in shape.

Barack Obama has worked to help Americans, no matter the opposition
When I was 12-years-old, a cardiologist told my father that his life depended on the replacement of multiple heart valves. A little more than a year later, my mother was given a similar diagnosis by a cancer specialist, and was told that a mastectomy was the only way to remove the tumor that had formed in her breast.
Luckily for my family, both my parents had jobs that provided the insurance coverage necessary to cover the almost $2 million in surgeries that it took to save my parents lives. But for millions of Americans, the cost of monthly insurance payments remains beyond their budgets, and the price of those procedures (almost 45 times the median income of a U.S. family) is more than they could imagine affording out of pocket. I shudder to think about what would have happened to my family if my parents had been one of the 43 million Americans that were uninsured before President Barack Obama took office.
I have no doubt that if the White House and Senate return to Republican control on Nov. 6, the 30 million people that Obamacare extends insurance to will lose the protection afforded them by Obama’s signature achievement. Republicans love to parrot the “repeal and replace” line. But their complete refusal to propose alternative solutions, and GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s admission that the problem of the uninsured was “not the issue” he cared about, speaks volumes about the Republican Party’s plans for helping average Americans.
Healthcare is not the only issue on which Obama outpaces his conservative adversaries. Obama’s first major initiative — the stimulus package — stopped the free fall our economy had fallen into and prevented a second Great Depression. His financial regulation ensured that the reckless behavior of the financial services industry never again threatened the livelihoods of everyday people looking to pay mortgages. Obama’s constant fights to extend unemployment benefits were a Herculean endeavor aimed at helping families make ends meet.
Obama’s populism and protection of the American Dream could find no better contrast than the craven attitudes and policies promoted by Republican challenger Mitt Romney. While Romney might have finally begun to speak the language of a moderate, his long awaited “etch-a-sketch” transformation cannot obscure the utter contempt he feels for working class Americans. How can a man who readily admitted he wasn’t “concerned about the very poor” credibly claim that he’ll once again make America the land of opportunity? How can a man who declared that 47 percent of our country was made up of “takers” believably tell us that he’ll fight for all Americans? The obvious answer is that he can’t.
Obama is not a perfect man. His first term in office has obviously had its share of missteps. But to claim that a president who implemented Republican ideas for health care reform, cut taxes on the middle class and implemented three Bush-era free trade agreements is a radical, is to not live in reality.
Obama extended an open hand to Republicans when he took office. By proposing conservative backed solutions for health care, climate change, financial regulation, campaign finance and a range of other policy areas, Obama looked in vain for partners across the aisle who sought to steer our country through a difficult period. On Nov. 6 he’ll extend that same hand to millions of Americans, rich, poor, black, white, conservative, liberal and everything in-between in the hopes of finding a citizens ready to work to move our country forward. Let’s pray that the American people return his gesture.

Mitt Romney has a plan to restore the United States
President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign was a success in large part because of the youth vote: 66 percent compared to McCain’s 28 percent. In the 2008 election, Obama excited young people; he showed charisma and laid out plans that he claimed would set the country back on the right track. Never before had such a young audience been tapped into.
Four years later, U.S. debt bulges at $16 trillion, with another trillion being added each year. Forty-seven million people are on food stamps. Poverty is at its highest level in nearly two decades. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling to find work, and 163 million people will have their taxes increased Jan. 1.
College students should be the people who are most concerned with these numbers. Soon, we’ll all be hunting for jobs, searching for ways to support ourselves and our families. We’re told every day how tough it’s become to find a job — from politicians to the media to friends and family, it seems the only thing everyone can agree on is the difficulty of breaking into (and staying in) the workplace.
So what has Obama proposed this election season to remedy this dire situation? Little to nothing. His first term did little to help the economic situation of the country; and in speeches and debates he has yet to lay out what he would do differently next time around.
This is the major difference between the candidates this election. Not only does Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney want to lead the country forward, he has the means to do it. Even Bill Clinton has praised Romney’s stellar record as a businessman. Romney’s accomplishments include running the 2002 Olympics on a balanced budget, creating tens of thousands of new jobs while serving as the governor of Massachusetts and balancing Massachusetts’ budget without raising taxes. In a time of need such as this, I believe we should look to a businessman to turn things around, not a politician.
Romney has the background to put this country back on the right track. He knows what it’s like to work with both sides of the aisle; he has had to gain bipartisan support many times in his political career. The country today is divided. Romney would work with Congress to help bring this country back together, which is what we need during a rough economic time like this. We need someone who will sit down with both sides to figure out what is truly the best course for the country; not a president who alienates those who disagree with him, which is what we have seen from Obama these past four years.
One of the great things about being young is that we’re not completely set in our ways. We don’t have the same kind of long-term commitment to a political party that some people do. We should vote for who would be objectively best for the nation; and I’ll be the first to say that if a Democrat ran on a platform I thought would help the nation, I would vote for him.
So when stepping into the voting booth or filling out your absentee ballot, think ahead to graduation. Think about leaving the comfort zone of college and entering the workplace fulltime and think about your two clear choices this year: a man whose failed economic policies have led to 50 percent of college students being unable to find work upon graduating, or a man who has spent a lifetime creating jobs in the private sector — a well established and respected businessman, who has laid out a plan to help restore America to its former glory.

The long road for the Los Angeles County District Attorney position is winding down for candidates Jackie Lacey and Alan Jackson. The two contenders have been campaigning since last year and made it through their primary races and are now days away from facing off in the Nov. 6 election.
Each candidate brings a different background and set of experiences to the position, as Jackson has spent the majority of his career as a prosecutor while Lacey has spent over a decade working on the managerial side of the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office.
As a gang prosecutor, Jackson worked in the DA’s office for 17 years and prosecuted more than 60 felony cases. According to his campaign website, Jackson aims to cut down on violent crime by targeting gangs and other violent offenders, stop public corruption by prosecuting public officials who “break the law and abuse the public trust” and reduce crime through education. He also highlights the need to modernize the DA’s office by utilizing new technologies.
“Let’s put a prosecutor in the prosecutor’s office, not a politician,” Jackson said in an interview with KRLA’s Heidi Harris. “We can’t handcuff our way out of the crime problem. We have to have an understanding that there’s more that we can do in the prosecutor’s office … to try and stop crime before it starts.”
Endorsements for Jackson largely come from different law enforcement agencies, including the Inglewood Police Association and the Pasadena Police Officers’ Association, but also include the Los Angeles Daily News, former Mayor Richard Riordan and Supervisor Don Knabe, among others.
Lacey, on the other hand, comes with managerial experience in addition to her experience as a prosecutor. She is the current chief deputy district attorney in the DA’s office and has worked on the office’s managerial team for over a decade; on the team, she has reviewed evidence in death penalty cases and has overseen cases involving public corruption and police misconduct, among other crimes. Lacey said she plans to draw on her experience as a prosecutor and administrator if elected.
“I’ve prosecuted everything from code enforcement cases to drug cases to murder cases to child molestation cases,” Lacey said in a campaign video. “The experience[s] I’ve had … have given me a unique experience, if you will, and have really prepared me to assume the role of district attorney.”
If Lacey wins the election, she will not only be the first black woman, but the first woman to serve as district attorney in Los Angeles. She is endorsed by current District Attorney Steve Cooley, L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca, the L.A. County Democratic Party, the Republican National Hispanic Assembly and the Los Angeles Times, among others.
Olu Orange, an adjunct associate professor of political science and the head coach of USC’s mock trial team, said each candidate needs to have a basic understanding that the role of the DA is to rehabilitate — not punish — criminals. Orange said he doesn’t think either candidate understands this role at this point in the election.
“One of the reasons that criminal justice system is so heavily burdened is that the focus is not on rehabilitating and integrating [criminals] back into society and the tax base, but has been refocused on punishment,” Orange said. “I’m looking to see if the DA candidates understand that the reason so many people are locked up is because their office wants to lock them up, sometimes unnecessarily.”
The two candidates are vying for the spot being vacated by Cooley, who has spent three consecutive terms in office since 2000. This year’s race is the first in 48 years without an incumbent running, according to ABC 7 news.
The job of the district attorney is to prosecute alleged criminals in the L.A. district court system on behalf of the people, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s website. The Los Angeles DA prosecutes crimes from Antelope Valley to Long Beach and from Pomona to Malibu.
Los Angeles has the largest local prosecutor’s office in the country — in a typical year, the DA’s office prosecutes 60,000 felonies and 130,000 misdemeanors, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s website.
Nov. 6 won’t be the first time Jackson and Lacey have gone head to head. The candidates already faced each other for the DA position in California’s preliminary election on June 5. Since none of the six candidates received at least 50 percent of the popular vote in the primary, Lacey and Jackson — the top two candidates — are set to square off again in the November election.
The two beat out John Breault, Bobby Grace, Danette Meyers and Carmen Trutanich for the position in the runoff. Lacey received 31.95 percent of the popular vote and Jackson received 23.69 percent.
Prior to the election, the candidates squared off in multiple debates. The May 29 debate before the primary featured five of the six candidates running at the time, while the August and September debates only featured Jackson and Lacey.
The August debate revealed a major difference between the two candidates in regards to their experience relevant to the DA position. Jackson argued that Lacey has assumed too much of an administrative role to work as the DA — she hasn’t worked in the courtroom for approximately a decade. Lacey countered that her role in management has given her a unique perspective that she would bring to the courtroom.
Aside from their differing backgrounds, the two candidates also clash on some of the major issues in the upcoming election. A primary source of contention is Proposition 36, or the three strikes reform act. California currently allows a life sentence in prison after a defendant gets “three strikes,” or is arrested three times. If passed, Prop. 36 would limit the potential for a life sentence to only serious or violent offenses. Lacey supports the measure, while Jackson opposes it.
The candidates agree on some issues, though: Both oppose banning the death penalty, and both also say they will continue to prosecute marijuana dispensaries even if the city’s ban on the clinics is reversed.
Though the position isn’t as prominent an election as other offices, Orange said that it is just as important for students to pay attention to what is happening in the district attorney’s office, as it will affect how crimes on campus are prosecuted.
“Anytime a student is accused of a crime, depending on what level of crime, there’s likelihood of involvement from someone from the DA’s office,” Orange explained. “This determines how aggressively these crimes are prosecuted on campus [and] to an extent, may determine how often crimes are committed.”

The debate between Propositions 30 and 38 is intensifying for California residents. Unfortunately, neither proposition is perfect. Prop. 30, Gov. Jerry Brown’s measure, plans to increase taxes on the richest Californians to help close the budget gap, generating revenue for schools and local public safety programs. Prop. 38, lawyer Molly Munger’s proposal, would raise the income tax rate on most Californians to help fund schools and pay down the state’s hefty education bond debt.
Both are far from the long-term care California’s systematically flawed school system and budget desperately need. But Prop. 38’s singular focus on K-12 education and use of a sliding scale to raise taxes for those earning as little as $7,316 per year is not the answer to California’s budget woes. Meanwhile, Prop. 30 is the only proposal that will prevent a $6 billion trigger cut to schools at all levels that have already been facing enormous budgetary problems for years. For these reasons, the Daily Trojan urges the Trojan Family to vote yes on Prop. 30 and no on Prop. 38.
With solid relief for public safety programs and schools alike, Prop. 30 is effectively the stronger option. Its funds would primarily come from increasing the income tax by 1 to 3 percentage points over seven years only on individuals who earn more than $250,000. The rest would come from increasing the state sales tax by a quarter of a cent for the next four years — a minor burden that would yield major benefits for the state, and one that would save K-12 schools from canceling up to three weeks’ worth of classes, UC students from paying mid-year tuition hikes, all state universities from slashing classes and state programs ranging from fire safety to substance abuse treatment from being reduced.
Some argue that voting for both propositions is the best route voters can take to ensure some sort of relief for California education. But before going to the polls or sending in their absentee ballots, voters should understand the implications of doing so.
A vote for Prop. 38 is a vote against Prop. 30 becoming law — something numerous experts and publications, including the Los Angeles Times, have pointed out. Prop. 38 also does nothing to stop the deep budget cuts for California’s university systems that Prop. 30 would prevent.
But support for Prop. 30 has plunged to only 46 percent of registered voters, down from 64 percent in March, according to the most recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released on Oct. 25. Another 42 percent of voters opposed the measure outright. A majority — 61 percent — of those polled, however, were over the age of 45, and other recent polls suggest young voter turnout could be a critical factor in Prop. 30’s passage or defeat. A Public Policy Institute of California poll released on Oct. 24 found that 70 percent of voters age 18 to 34 support Prop 30. The difference between the successful passing of Prop. 30 and a future of crippling budget cuts lies in whether these voters turn out come election day.
Californians deserve education that isn’t burdened by shortened terms or budget cuts. Prop. 30 presents a clear path to ensuring that students do not lose out. Though Prop. 38 is well-intended, Prop. 30 offers the kind of broad financial relief California’s public schools need now.
USC students might not be directly impacted by Prop. 30’s passage or failure, but our university will be. Every year, USC accepts an increasing number of community college and state university students, all of whom face the burden of budget cuts to schools.
With our peers’ educations on the line, it’s clear that we must vote yes on 30 — a measure that will help steer California’s future in the right direction.

Thank you for some other fantastic article. The place else could anybody get that type of info in such a perfect method of writing? I’ve a presentation next week, and I am on the look for such info.
this article is such a joke
“USC students might not be directly impacted by Prop. 30’s passage or failure”
Unless USC students never buy anything ever again, they will all be affected by Prop 30.
1. It must be easy to endorse this for you as long as you don’t have to pay it. It’s always easy to spend other people’s money, especially if they’re well off. After all, they’re all just greedy, right? No. They have earned their money. They can do what they want with it.
2. Cut the frivolous spending. That’s how this state got into trouble in the first place. And I earned my money through hard work. I didn’t earn it just to give it right back to people that control their spending.
3. Of course older people oppose 30. It’s a stopgap solution that only really affects them, and not in a good way.
*can’t control their spending – I’ll put this here, even though it should be obvious.
Papers giving endorsements to any party is the dumbest s*** around today.
Figures a bunch of college kids with nothing majors would just willy nilly want a tax on those who have worked hard for a great income. They’ll never see that figure annually.
Gavin newsom says brown is lying about USC and UC tuition hikes…look it up
[…] But the best part of the supplement to me is the DT‘s endorsement of Proposition 30. If you haven’t voted yet, if you’ve already decided, whatever — give it a read. Prop. 30 isn’t perfect, but it’s the better of two options (versus the challenger Proposition 38). Check it out here: Yes on Prop 30 […]

As polls continue to report a drop in interest among young voters, the atmosphere on college campuses like USC speaks to a different trend.
“You’re voting for Romney?” an outraged Kevin Li yelled across Trousdale Parkway. “No way man, Obama all the way!”
“Hey, Romney’s pretty damn good!” his friend Bernie Yang volleyed back.
Though most recent statistics show a drop in young voter interest, walking around USC in the final days of the presidential campaign unearths more exchanges like this than analysts might expect.
The most recent Gallup poll of voters ages 18-29 showed only 58 percent of those registered intend to vote, as opposed to the 78 percent who said they would definitely vote in 2008.
And the youth vote could be a critical factor in determining the winner of the election. With President Barack Obama leading Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the popular vote by only 1 percentage point, an uptick or downturn in youth voters could sway the results dramatically. With the election only days away, Obama leads Romney among young voters by 19 percentage points, according to a study by the Harvard Institute of Politics.
But for a youth culture that polls as particularly uninterested in politics, college students seem to put on a convincing act — on almost any day in October, voter registration tables, political clubs and student activists could be found encouraging voter registration and turnout on campus.
Li, a sophomore majoring in computer science business administration, said his peers fall into two dramatically different groups: the activists and the apathetic.
“There are a lot of apathetic people, who say, ‘Screw it, it’s just politics,’ and don’t want to be a part of it,” Li said. “I don’t think those people will turn out to vote because they don’t see a point.”
Some tie this perception of the election as unimportant to a lack of excitement about Obama’s first term. Dotty Lynch, professor of public communication at American University and political consultant for CBS News, analyzed the trend toward apathy as young voters response to feeling let down.
“I think that the Obama administration has been a bit of a disappointment to some young people who really believed he could make a massive change in how Washington worked, and that hasn’t happened,” Lynch said. “In 2008 he was new on the scene, he was an excited candidate, and I think people were excited because of the news of him and the promise of him.”
Ange-Marie Hancock, a professor of political science at USC, saw the financial climate as a cause of some apathy toward the election, especially in college students. As voters enter their 20s and begin searching for jobs and financial independence, she said, the economy — and the perception of the government’s inability to improve it — could also discourage voting.
“There is a lot of youth unemployment,” Hancock said. “I think people are a little bit disaffected in that they went to college they spent all this money and now they don’t have a job.”
Coming off the 2008 election, what Hancock called the “high-water mark” in youth voting in recent history, voters said they just do not feel the same sense of urgency.
“There [is] definitely going to be a lot of voter participation from our age group, but it isn’t the same as coming off the 2008 election where there was a lot of hype,” said Connor Schroeder, a junior majoring in environmental studies.
Though some experts label young voters as unlikely participants, many voters in this demographic still express strong opinions about voting.
“This is a really important election because it could be Obama’s second term and he is such a milestone president,” said Amy Schmidt, a sophomore majoring in English. “People will be passionate about making that happen or changing that, and either way, I think it will be just as big.”
Other students said interest in the election has not waned, either. Hailey Gill, a senior majoring in kinesiology, said the sheer number of Facebook statuses she read about the debates show that her peers will vote.
“For the last debate, I was at the gym and people stopped in their tracks to watch it on the big TV,” Gill said. “College students seem interested in the election, and there might not be as high of a turnout, but there will still be significant turnout.”
Lynch attributed the recent increase in interest that Gill and Schmidt experienced to the closeness of the presidential race.
“I’ve been talking to the Obama coordinators in varying states, such as Ohio, and they have said the recent polls showing the election is close have given them more volunteers, have made more people interested in the election and have gotten them more involved,” Lynch said.
With just days remaining until Election Day, the population of young voters appears split. Like the election itself, the participation of young voters will have to be decided at the polls.

When Max Blum, a senior majoring in cinema and television production, cast his first presidential ballot in 2008, enthusiasm was high among his friends.
“I felt really proud,” Blum said. “It was a great chance to cast my vote in something that was so monumental in American history.”
Galvanized by the ideas of “hope” and “change,” young voters turned out in droves to the polls in 2008, electing then-Sen. Barack Obama to fix up Washington.
This year, however, Blum said the ratiionale driving youth voters to support Obama has changed. Blum said younger liberal voters seem less motivated this year by idealism and more by a dislike of Republican candidate Mitt Romney.
“Instead of focusing on the positive aspects of the two campaigns, it’s a really negative person versus someone who’s already there,” Blum said.
Though Obama leads Romney in polls tracking youth support, the backing he once had in 2008 has dissipated. Earlier this month, Harvard’s Institute of Politics released a poll that showed Obama with a 12-point lead among likely 18- to 24-year-olds. Back in October 2008, that same poll showed the president with a 26-point lead over then-Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain.
Peter Levine, director of the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, attributes this increase in support for Romney in part to the Republican Party’s efforts in 2012 to mobilize voters through campus organizations or independent partisan groups — a big change from 2008.
“The Republicans in ’08 did a pathetic job trying to mobilize young people, as in they didn’t show any sign of having a good strategy for that or even having anybody assigned to work on it,” Levine said, “and they even went at trying to make a negative issue out of Obama’s youth support.”
Logan Morris, who graduated in May, voted in his first presidential election as a California resident in 2008. For Morris, much of the excitement was generated by a sense that he could make a real difference with significant issues, such as Proposition 8, a statewide initiative to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage.
“We [got] to vote for the first African-American president and this important issue of human rights,” Morris said. “It was part of the excitement of getting to vote on real, important issues.”
With enthusiasm waning among many of Obama’s younger supporters in 2008, the president’s campaign has focused on energizing that particular segment of the electorate.
Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said the campaign has targeted younger voters by talking about issues of interest to them, such as Pell grants.
“One of the most important objectives for the Obama campaign is finding a way to remotivate younger voters,” Schnur said. “There is no way to recreate the excitement of 2008, but they are working very hard to reach out to young people to try to increase their level of interest and involvement.”
Jennifer Massey, a junior majoring in history and a member of the USC College Republicans, said that when she voted in 2008, the Obama campaign mobilized young voters by touting the campaign’s historical significance. From walking around on campus and talking to friends, Massey said she believes first-time voters are less excited because 2012 does not bear the same immediate historic importance.
“They are excited because they have the opportunity [to vote] finally, but they are not excited about the candidates,” Massey said. “If they were voting in 2008, I think they would have definitely been excited.”
Dietram Scheufele, a communication professor at the University of Wisconsin, said the lack of enthusiasm does not mean younger voters who backed Obama in 2008 will cast their ballots for Romney this year.
“For him it’s not a matter of the youth vote going conservative, it’s a matter of whether they will turn out or not,” Scheufele said.
Given the overwhelming support Obama received from younger voters in 2008, Schnur said it would be difficult for Romney to persuade these voters to swing toward the Republican Party — a shift that would typically only happen over several election cycles.
“This is a voter group that has been very very heavily supportive of Obama,” Schnur said. “Moving a lot more of them from one party to another is a pretty difficult challenge. When you generally see a demographic voter group switch from one party to another it’s generally the result of a more gradual process.”
The poll released by Harvard’s IOP also sheds light on the degree to which youth voters support the two candidates. The results found that of the young voters who support Romney, 10 percent are more likely to say they are “definitely” voting Romney than younger Obama supporters said.
USC College Republicans President Maddy Lansky said she has seen more enthusiasm within her group during this election cycle. Lansky also said more students are comfortable saying they support Romney and the Republican Party.
“I’ve noticed in the past young people aren’t as comfortable saying they fall to the right or support a Republican candidate,” Lansky said.
Ultimately, experts said it is difficult to determine whether 2012 will have a large impact the long-term party affliation of a first- or second-time voter. Levine said he believes that in 2008, younger voters were not necessarily being loyal to the Democratic Party, but instead testing a more left-leaning political view.
“I think they were trying out a liberal, progressive world view because the exit polls showed that they were very enthusiastic about general involvement in the economy,” Levine said. “However, I don’t think it solidified because I think four years later the proportion of people who have those positive government views has declined.”

USC official have many policies in place to make us feel safe. Are they really enforced?. I was told security was spread very thin last night and there were too many events on campus. That is not acceptable, security should have been increased. Was anyone there to check the ids of the more than 100 people that were just hanging out outside the party? I feel security fell short last night. Hearing that none of the people involved were students just makes matters worse. Why were they on campus? Why was there not increased security on Hallloween?
The Black Students Association bears a lot of responsibility for this unacceptable tragedy in the heart of campus.  Its leaders should know better than to allow or encourage non USC students, at least one of whom was an arms carrying, violent criminal, to party with students.  All USC student groups need to be reminded of the risks associated with hosting parties with non students.  And the USC administration needs to prohibit USC from hosting any night club-like event on campus involving non students.  USC must place the BSA on probation now.
Welcome to the jungle (aka as Los Angeles).  As I was typing my last post (my nephew is currently a student at SC) at my Wilshire Blvd. office, I see helicopters and heard the sounds of sirens outside.  I looked out from the 25th floor and cops are currently all outside including news vans on Wilshire Blvd.   Apparently, a  girl was shot outside a B of A.  Don’t know if she made it but praying that she does.  It is a crazy world out there.  Please be careful.

Rayamen Middlebrooks, 21, and Andre Shields, 20, two community college students from South Los Angeles, came to USC Wednesday night to attend “Freak or Greek” — an on-campus Halloween party — with some of their friends. Before they even made it into the event, however, they witnessed the shooting of four people.
Middlebrooks said they were waiting in a long line outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom when they heard the party was over capacity and the crowd started to turn hostile.
“As soon as they said that, we heard a lot of commotion,” Middlebrooks said. “A lot of people were arguing, and then five seconds later, all you hear is gunshots and everybody running.”
Shields and Middlebrooks ran away from Trousdale, when they saw one of the victims bleeding from a stomach wound. Shields said the victim’s friend helped him hobble over to a paramedic.
Though they did not expect their night to end with a shooting, Middlebrooks said he thought a confrontation might happen at the event based on the size of the crowd.
“From the beginning, I knew that that was how the crowd was, and things were gonna happen like this,” Middlebrooks said. “It was at least 500 people, and that was only outside.”
Even with the hectic crowd, though, Middlebrooks did not expect something as severe as a shooting.
“You just don’t think it was going to be shots fired on USC campus,” Middlebrooks said. “Gunshots on USC campus? Out of everywhere else? You just don’t think there are going to be gunshots on USC campus.”
I have to agree with some of my alumni fraternity buddies.  Why was this open to non students?

A shooting occurred during a Halloween party outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at approximately 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday.
A suspect opened fire on one victim during an argument, wounding three others in the process. All four victims were taken to California Hospital Medical Center. One remains in critical but stable condition, and the other three sustained relatively minor injuries.
The Los Angeles Police Department took two unidentified male suspects into custody and recovered a handgun from the scene.

Both thugs wearing red. Not too obvious they are in  a gang. Nice security. Resign Nicklas.
What a chaotic, sad night.

[This story has been updated. See below for details.]
The Los Angeles Police Department has detained two suspects following a shooting that injured four people near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at approximately 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday, according to campus authorities.

The shooting occurred about 100 yards from a Halloween costume party, “Freak or Greek,” which was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s ballroom. The event, which began at 9 p.m., was hosted by a USC student organization and LA Hype, a night life and entertainment group. The party drew a crowd of about 1,500, according to the Dept. of Public Safety.
“We were waiting outside to get into the party, and we were waiting for a while — maybe 20 or 30 minutes,” said Olivia Gordon, a freshman majoring in psychology. “And all of the sudden, as soon as people started going inside, there were multiple gunshots and everyone who was in line for the party ducked and we all ran.”
A confrontation occurred between two unidentified males, which led one to shoot the other, inadvertently injuring three others in the process, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. The intended victim was shot three to four times in the torso, according to LAPD Cmdr. Bob Green. The other three victims did not sustain life-threatening injuries.
“I heard three gunshots … there might have been more than that,” said Christina Nour, a freshman majoring in civil engineering building science. “Then I ducked. It didn’t feel real. It felt like it was a movie because I really haven’t experienced anything like this before. I was running as fast as I can, trying to make sure I didn’t get trampled or tripped. I just ran as fast as I could, as far as I could.”
Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs, released a statement on the university’s website, saying DPS had been monitoring the area near the party. He also noted the importance of ensuring safety.
“This incident reminds us that we must look out for ourselves and be particularly vigilant about the personal safety of friends and guests at our social events,” Jackson said.
After the shooting, officers at the scene identified the shooter as well as an unidentified male who was fleeing the scene with him. Officers followed the two to Parking Lot 6 and detained them; they also retrieved the handgun used in the shooting from the ground at the lot.
DPS issued a Trojan Alert at 12:02 a.m. on Thursday, asking students to take “shelter in place and avoid opening doors for unknown persons.” DPS and LAPD also immediately cordoned off the area near the shooting, including from Bovard Auditorium to Mudd Hall and from the Campus Center to the eastern edge of Hahn Plaza. The entire University Park Campus was locked down soon after.
Despite the lockdown, LAPD said the event in the Campus Center continued even as the shooting and its aftermath unfolded outside.
“Music continued to play, and they continued to party,” Green said.
At approximately 2 a.m., DPS and LAPD opened the campus to students, faculty and staff with USC identification. The entire campus was reopened at 4:52 a.m.
Asst. DPS Chief John Thomas said that the incident was not indicative of the overall level of safety in and around USC.
“[USC has] a great partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department. We are one of the safest campuses in the country — we make sure that we have the necessary resources at the event, we do necessary planning and unfortunately [the shooting] happened outside,” he said. “These are individuals that unfortunately came here and decided to disrupt what otherwise would have been a very peaceful event, like all of our events on campus.”
[Update #1: Victims recovering from Halloween shooting]

Geno Hall, a former Crenshaw High School football star and 2009 L.A. City Football Player of the Year, was recovering from seven bullet wounds in critical but stable condition Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Eugene Hall, Geno’s father, told the Times that his son was recovering from a three-hour surgery in the intensive care unit of California Hospital Medical Center. The younger Hall sustained bullet wounds to the left thigh, back of leg, buttocks and arm, according to his father.
“The doc says he’ll pull through but they’re keeping him up there,” Eugene Hall told the Times.
Geno Hall was the intended victim of the shooting that occurred outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center late Wednesday night. Three others were also admitted to California Hospital with minor injuries. None of the victims or suspects were affiliated with the university, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
LAPD officials said they expect the other three victims to make a full recovery.
[Update #2: President Nikias addresses Halloween shooting]
In a statement posted Thursday, USC President C. L. Max Nikias addressed the shootings that occurred on campus and assured parents and students of USC’s continued safety.
Nikias wrote that the individuals involved in the shooting were not affiliated with the university. USC’s policy allows student parties to be open to USC students and students from other colleges with a college ID.
Nikias did, however, say that the university will review this policy in light of Wednesday’s incidents.
“We are now carefully assessing and reviewing all of the university’s policies regarding visitors and events held on campus,” he wrote.
He continued to say that USC is still a safe campus, calling the risk of on-campus crimes like the shooting “very low.”
“I want to personally assure you that the university mobilized all its resources in responding to this incident, and worked closely with Los Angeles Police Department in ensuring our students’ safety,” Nikias wrote.
Nikias also acknowledged safety concerns stemming from Wednesday’s shooting and other incidents, such as the off-campus shooting last year that killed international graduate students Ying Wu and Ming Qu.
“All of us have been shaken by serious incidents this year,” Nikias wrote. “Despite these events, or indeed because of them, we must continue to support each other as members of the Trojan Family.”
CORRECTION: there was no USC organization invovled in the production of this party! Please have the correct information before you post things like this.
I was in Leavey Library at the time of the shooting. For those of you who don’t know campus, it’s a stone’s throw away from VKC (where one of the victims was treated) and about a 3 minute walk from the Campus Center. We suddenly see the ambulances and fire trucks storm through McCarthy quad and know something is up. Of course, our generation immediately heads to Twitter to find the most up-to-date information. A shooting at Campus Center. The suspect has fled on foot.
29 minutes later we receive an alert (I received mine ten minutes later than a peer next to me.) “A shooting was reported in the area of the campus center. Shelter in place and avoid opening doors.”
Let me reiterate, 29 minutes later!
I could have walked, (or worse, the suspect at large) back and forth from the campus center to Leavey Library 10 times before I’d even be notified by the “Trojan Alert” system. Let’s take a frightening flashback to the Virginia Tech shooting of last year. 33 killed in a University Library.
Don’t you think USC/LAPD should have sent an officer to stand in front of the main library entrance?
Or how about give a short address on the PA loudspeaker ensuring our safety?
How about any instructions at all?
Nothing. Not a word. Not a security guard/DPS officer/LAPD officer in sight. In fact, I walked in and out of the library without my ID even being checked twice between 11-2am. I’m glad that they are using the PA system efficiently to make sure we secure our bikes to the racks, but not to tell us that we are safe inside and to stay put. Some students stayed while others left. At 2am, Twitter reports said the suspect was caught but the campus was still on “Lockdown.” I walked to my car and drove off without a DPS guard checking my ID, or even asking me pull down my window. Could the shooter/other members of his gang been in the car behind me fleeing? Who knows?
I’m not a complainer. In fact, I’ve never written on the Daily Trojan forum in 4 years here. But last night USC did not do its job of making me feel secure. They sent late vague text alerts, abandoned me and my peers with no direction, and lost a lot of my trust. Last week LAPD cited me $300 for Jaywalking. I think they should get their priorities in order…
My sympathies go out to the victims and I wish them a speedy recovery.
Let me reiterate. I love USC. I love the Trojan Family. I wouldn’t trade my decision to go here for all the money in the world. But last night, USC, you betrayed me. If only I was hungrier and wanted to grab a bite from one of the campus center eateries an hour before. If only.

they need to guard every gate especially at night. anyone can just walk into the campus from the north. its laughable how lax it is.
@Alumnus and Donor
Come pick up your check.  We don’t want to be associated with you anymore!
@Ryan – if you’re a student, without donors you wouldn’t have a building to type that hack on.
Care to publish your credentials, or are you a student at a UC or CS school?
1) I am a current student at USC.
2) USC has billions in the bank and your $1,000 tax deductible donation means nothing.
3) You are obviously a bitter fat old man.
Dear “Alumnus and Donor”: 
When I talk about East Coast campuses, it’s because I know what I am talking about. I was accepted to U Chicago, Columbia, Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, which was probably the least safe of them all. Despite these offers, I chose to come to USC and would still do so any day of the week and twice on Sunday. I made this decision based on the fact that none of the aforementioned choices have what this one does: The Trojan Family. As cliché as that sounds, that was the reason. You keep citing this incident as if this is the only one that has occurred in the last 10 years. The reality is that this is the fourth shooting incident in the area surrounding USC within the last seven months. In every single one of those incidents someone was injured or, in the case of our two grad students, murdered. Look, I’m far what anyone would consider a “sheltered” person. I’ve seen things growing up in my old neighborhood that I hope no one ever has to see. With that being said, these are too many incidents to just consider them “isolated cases.” As for what I think the administration should do, I don’t have all of the answers nor do I claim to. For starters however, I feel that “donors” just as yourself should demand answers from a university administration who overlooked the organization of this event. Let’s be frank Sir: By donating money to this institution, you are making an investment in its future. I can assure you that these shootings are not great for the reputation of this institution, and are putting your “investment” at risk. I think that with relation to this incident, those responsible for the oversight of this incident should be either repremanded or excused from their employment with USC. With regards to the surrounding area, USC should expand its DPS perimeter to include Walton Ave, Budlong Ave., etc. These are areas where large amounts of students live. Install DPS command centers there along with “blue light” systems. USC should also think about expanding the radius that “campus cruiser” covers to include these areas as well. These changes should improve the situation until USC can accommodate more student housing when it rebuilds the UV across from campus. My suggestions may not be perfect, but hey, it’s a start. With relation to keeping campus open, I agree however with limitations. The parties of your parents’ time are long gone and extremely different my friend. With all of that being said, I will always remain faithful to USC because of how good it was to me. Fight On!
Thank you for this. 
Fight On.
You have good suggestions and I have little argument with your comments.  I do want to refine your view that some are “overlooking” university policy or shortcomings.  I feel the reverse.  In fact, the scrutiny is significant and the university leadership is very focused on addressing these issues.  While I am not directly involved with those boards, the university’s learning environment is the highest priority for any academic administrator.  This is true at USC and any institution of higher learning.
By the way, I was accepted at several east coast universities also, including Ivy League.  I also selected USC because of the USC family.  That Trojan family is the financial engine which fuels the privacy of the university and has long standing commitment to it.
I agree, which is why BSA or any other organization should be held accountable for their actions. I also agree that non-USC people should not be allowed to USC social events. In my four years here, I never saw an armed individual run to an academic or resumé buliding workshop.
I will always remain faithful to both USC and the Trojan Family, but this incident and the other three that have happend around campus within the past year is truly disheartening. With tuition hovering around $60,000 a year, the last thing that SC students or any other students for that matter should be worrying about is having to dodge bullets while they’re on campus. Other prestigious universities around the county are located in “urban” areas (U Chicago, Columbia, Yale, Berkeley) yet don’t seem to have this many problems. I along with just about every other members of the Trojan Family are tired of hearing “No USC students were involved” as a sign that everything is okay. Some people are trying to racialize this issue by saying that this was a BSA sponsored event. I personally don’t care if it was the Black, Latino, Asian, Greek or any other student organization who sponsored this event, they must answer for their decisions! At what point is the administration going to decide to do something? In the unfortunate event that another USC student is seriously injured or killed? Please do not allow this university lose the hard fought ground that it has gained as a prestigious academic institution by not making the necessary changes to campus security and its policies. USC has been in this area of Los Angeles since 1880 and does not have to answer to the community, nor open the campus to the community for these types of events. President Nikias, you pride yourself on attracting the best and brightest students to come to campus and your administration is failing to protect them. Please tell me you have something better to say than “USC is still a safe campus.”
The reason people are pointing out that this was a BSA event is that this would not have happened at a regular fraternity party, and the administration should have taken the risks into account before signing off on this party. I’m not saying the BSA shouldn’t be able to have parties, they just shouldn’t be allowed to invite hundreds of non-USC students to an on-campus party.
@Recent Grad ’12
Your assumption is incorrect.
USC is one of the safest campuses in Southern California, until this event occurred.
While I agree with your call for administration to “do something”, what exactly would like the administration to actually do?
Have you actually been to East Coast campuses?
Have you ever looked at New Haven, Connecticut?
What about touring the major east coast medical schools?  The neighborhoods around east coast medical schools and some universities are far worse than USC’s.
This doesn’t negate your call for administration to take a strong position, but again what is that position you are suggesting?
I believe that the university needs to remain an open campus and to hold events that are open.
Here is a quote from Nikias’s statement ‘…Although this incident did not involve USC students and was resolved quickly,…”
So i guess he does not consider 4 people getting gunned down in the middle of the campus at the STUDENT CENTER to be something that involves USC students. Why does USC always bother to make this stupid point? Do they believe stray bullets will continue to magically  stop and consider student ID in the future? YOU HAD AN ATTEMPTED MURDER ON CAMPUS LAST NIGHT!!!!!! Don’t insult people’s intelligence by trying to sugar coat the fact USC  is in the middle of a jungle ghetto
Nikias disgraced himself with this blatantly inaccurate response. In truth, half an hour passed before the school warned anyone. SC is incredibly lucky that no students were hurt. 
It’s pretty clear that public safety is not something the current administration takes seriously. 2 dead graduate students and now gunfire on campus…what is it going to take for changes to be made?
Jack,
Change has taken place. By now, through eye witness reports, social media and the excellent reporting of the Daily Trojan and Neon Tommy it is known:
1. The advance information published by the promotors inviting non-students for a fee violated USC policy. USC admins were asleep at the wheel–no one noticed.
2. The perpetrator was not immediately apprehended as President Nikias indicated in his only response to the tragedy.
3.  Students were not immediately notified, but notified 29 minutes later.
What has changed, markedly, are judgements regarding President Nikias’ leadership ability and motivation in providing disinformation in his only response to the Trojan community and larger community.  He has created a serious breach of trust and introduced unnecessary additional anxiety for many wondering who, if anyone, is in charge.
I am heartened that the students and parents have demonstrated constructive concern. The USC student media have provided the leadership and essential information absent thus far from the administration and are to be commended.
With all due respect to President Nikias, some breeches of trust cannot be repaired. I hope by this point President Nikias, the USC administration and trustees appreciate the seriousness and depth of these concerns and shortcomings.
As parents of a freshman- the above comments do not inspire much confidence in the University and we have to concur that the official response is weak and clearly unsupported by some of the  students reports.
 USC has an absolute obligation to make the safety of students the number one priority. No parent should have to get a call with such terrible news. Regardless of the students status- this happened on campus and any number of kids could have been hurt. This is not the first incident and despite security presence- students were not safe.
From descriptions given by students the building was over capacity and the spillover outside may have been too many people to control.
Furthermore- when I tried to call Student Affairs from the East Coast- the usual office hours were in effect and when I did get through I was told everyone was in a meeting. No one cares about press releases or damage control. You have a student body from all over the world and there needs to be a system in place the minute something happens to respond to parents questions and concerns. I was horrified by the light tone of the person I spoke to-
This is serious USC- Every parent wants to trust that their child is safe. We want to understand how this happened and what measures will be taken next. Do not waste time “reviewing your policies”. This is not about changing the menu in the dining hall.
I urge every parent in the community to stay on this issue until better protective systems are in place.
Hell, I’m not even a parent (but recent grad), and I’m going to stay on this. This is an embarrassment for our university that was billed as safe less than six months ago. Off-campus incidents happen in our area, but at an event sanctioned and promoted by the BSA to non-students that causes this is unacceptable. Not to mention university policy was violated.
First of all – I want to know WHO ultimately signed off on this party at Tutor Hall – the epicenter of campus. Give us a name and show you guys at USC believe in accountability.
Second – I think if Hurricane Sandy hit the West Coast and flooded the entire campus – as long as all students, staff and employees stayed away and did not get wet, USC’s spin would be that a “non-USC flood” took place. Stray bullets do not stop and check for student ID. The fact is, USC is in the ghetto. Listen up parents – just think of all the predators in the ghetto who know your kids are probably carrying around at least a few $100’s of computers, ipads, cellphones on them. Like ripe fruit for hungry animals. And our politically correct City Council, mayor, LAPD and DPS are too cowardly to deal with this head on. I am sure the thugs know this as well.
Third – after the self entitled douche at UCLA who refused to show ID when confronted by campus security a few years ago – we have basically turned ourselves into a society that can feel they can blow off the instructions of an officer and then sue if met with force. Well congrats everyone. Now any thug can feel they can wonder around on your campus and if asked for ID then they can play the race card and claim they are being profiled. You got what you asked for – the inability for security to ask for ID and then forcible remove a person if they refuse.
ras, 
Neon Tommy and The Trojan have been an excellent resources for providing information not forthcoming yet from the administration. Here is some information from Neon Tommy that may be a starting point for addressing your concerns:
“After numerous calls—and in-person requests—for comment to university officials, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent the media an email saying the following:
…The event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween.”
WORRIED PARENT
As a parent I agree wholeheartedly with the above. I am tired of the Universities response to incidents of violence near and now ON campus. It doesn’t matter to me that the shooters nor victims were not students. Our children could easily be caught in the crossfire.
Instead of a new mall, how about fencing around the school? Why not install metal detectors? As the student pointed out above, he was free to come and go on campus, no one checked him for ID.They cannot go too far in keeping our kids safe. I noticed an LA Times poll this afternoon showing 77% of the people answering the survey felt there needs to be more security around USC. I don’t think we should be placated with weak letters such as the President’s this afternoon. We parents must speak out together. I encourage all of you to write, email or call the University. You can’t call this an “isolated incident” when it is the third very violent crime on or near campus in about six months.
Many of us are making enormous sacrifices to send our children to USC. I don’t think they can go too far to increase security. I have a second child applying to college this fall, and I don’t think I will have him apply to USC. I have defended the campus to detractors who say it is in a dangerous neighborhood. In the past, I’d say “It’s not so bad”.. But watching my daughter’s campus featured in a story on the national news this morning, I’m not making that statement anymore.
To Teresa,
I’m not involved with USC administration but I am a lifelong Trojan, recent donor to the University, and alumnus.
The events last night are an unfortunate reflection of many universities across our nation and are not a reflection of USC’s administrative policies nor the students of the university.
While I understand your concern, your suggestions appear to reflect a lack of personal experience at the university campus.
For one thing, the USC campus is already ringed with a fence.  In times past, the surrounding community felt ostracized by USC due to the presence of the fence.  Your call for “fencing around the school” suggests that you are not familiar with the campus itself.
Secondly, your call for metal detectors is ridiculous.  All university campuses are open and are not secured like the TSA secures an airport.  For that matter, do you seriously argue that TSA has made flying any more secure with it’s backscatter detectors providing LAX TSA a nude photo of your daughter?  I can not concurr with your supposition of increased security due to the presence of metal detectors and I can not agree with the insertion of such scanning technologies at your hypothetical gates.
I spent nearly ten years involved with USC as a high school student, student, and graduate student.  During the LA riots I was a student at USC.  USC was clearly secured down and no USC facilities or personnel were impacted.
During several incidents while I was a student at USC, there were armed attacks at LA County medical center.  Through cooperation between LA Sheriff’s Department and USC Security, the students were secured and protected by armed law enforcement.
During several when I was a student at USC, there were events in the surrounding community where LA helicopters were flown over campus and around campus to assist in patrol and securing facilities.
I am quite confident that USC and the LA County law enforcement community excel at containing situations like those last night.  In fact, the fact that no USC students were involved should give you pause to credit the university security team that isolated the event and the local law enforcement personnel who also secured the suspects.
But, instead, you chose to launch criticism at the university.  Instead, I would respectfully suggest that you aim your criticism at the gun toting suspects and instead of the people who apprehended them.
Speaking more frankly, I find it amazing that students are so entitled that a 29 minute delay in notification becomes problematic.  When I was living at Marks, Pardee, Webb, and Fluor, there was no social media, no web, and only the local RA (resident advisor) to knock on my door.  Are you seriously so entitled that you expect the USC Board of Directors to personally send you a letter when every incident occurs?  If it is that important to you, perhaps you might want to donate a few thousand dollars to help set up the system yourself?
While I understand the security concern, I do not understand the vindictive nature of the vitriol aimed at USC.
The need for improved security is always real, but seriously arguing that you are entitled to more explanation based upon your hard work in sending your child to USC?  I worked my way through USC and had USC scholarships too.  Your posting is demeaning!
There’s plenty of other kids from Southern California who want to attend USC and are not concerned about the security on campus.
Two points of issue:
(1) Your statement that “[t]he events . . . are not a reflection of USC’s administrative policies nor the students of the university” is incorrect. There are lots of details to come about the approval process for this event, but rest assured that it represents a systemic management failure.
(2) Your remark that students should not be upset about having to wait 29 minutes for information is ill-informed. My father had to use a slide rule when he was in school; I get a calculator. Times (and expectations) change.
@Anon
On point 1 – feel free to publish.  As a donor and alumnus, I am interested in stewardship and leadership having appropriate oversight.  However, I’m also fed up with entitlements and the lack of individual responsibility in our community.  We’re USC and pay our own way.  We don’t look to have dependency on others for our own safety.  I take my own safety into my own control.  As such, USC’s community and campus is no different than any other collegiate campus across the United States.  We’re just as susceptible to violent crime and just as responsible for maintaining the safety of students.  If you think “systemic management failure” is occurring, I am all ears on the system, the management, and the allegation of failure.  But, not one of the comments posted appropriately singles out the criminal who carried a concealed weapon, discharged the weapon into another human being, and then attempted to run.  There is more to this story than finger pointing at an administrative process.  If you seriously believe that an administrative process could improve and proactively intervene prior to commission of violent crime, you are deluded.  This is not Minority Report nor should we permit the USC campus to become San Quentin.
2.  My remark about entitlement is not ill-informed.  Times may change but human behavior does not.  You’ll have to explain why a 29 minute information flow is upsetting.  Do you expect to have information in seconds?  minutes?  How many?  The point is that it’s idiotic to expect the security teams to have precise information while they are still trying to get information on what is occurring themselves.  Has it occurred to you that social media blares information without that information going through a check and balance?  Has it occurred to you that USC Security could end up sending a false alarm IF the information is not clearly vetted and that the vetting of that information takes time???
1. All I will say here is that Jackson’s statement that the event was “approved as an exception” is a lie or, at the very least, is incredibly disingenuous; the event was not supposed to be approved, yet it was because (multiple) people messed up along the way. Nikias’ announcement next week will seek to rectify this, even if the problem itself is not explicitly acknowledged. I find this system of dealing with problems like this internally inherently flawed—there is no accountability, and there should (and can) be.
2. Of course information should be vetted. That said, a 29-minute delay for a message that states that a suspect is “at large” is out of step with our (i.e., students’) era. We can argue about whether it is more damaging for information that is not fully vetted to be shared, but, in this case, the information was pretty clear immediately. Precise information wasn’t needed here. Just a note and a location to stay away from. Anyone who has ever seen a movie knows that sound. The issue is, once again, systemic. If you’re a big donor, make a push on that—how do the alerts get sent? What’s the process? What’s the ETA after they’re sent? All interesting points….
I read your response to Teresa and It appears that you must work for USC. I am the parent of a freshman and I am completely up in arms about how this was allowed to happen. Yes, I agree with you about the fencing because we do have an open campus. I do not know if adding fencing or metal detectors is the answer but here is what I do believe- this event should not have been allowed on campus-period. USC and the event coordinators had to known that people would show up intoxicated and/or high since they told people to leave all substances behind at a certain point.  Nothing good comes from that many people showing up to a night club, already wasted.
How can you say that 29 minutes it not too long for our students to be alerted? Althouugh you were not fortunate enough to have this media available to you.. it is something that they push to parents as one of the  measures they take to keep our students safe. When they promise us they would be alerted “immeditately” they need to keep to this promise. My daughter lives in the pardee dorm and I know for a fact that she and her and friends were not comfortable with all of these non-students coming onto campus.. already drunk.. not acting like students. So uncomfortable that after being excited to be on campus for Halloweeen, stayed in their dorms. Luckily, she was not in the vicinity of this event and was already indoors. It could have easilly been her that was hit by a stray bullet. The whole problem is that our beloved USC should not have allowed this event to take place.. point closed. No good was coming out of this party and it was unfair to the kids who live on campus to have so many strangers in their backyard. I was so upset by the letter from the president. The fact that no students were injured, does not make it ok. I am sure they cannot admit they are wrong in the letter or admit any wrong-doing but I hope that they do eventually. Although I am confident that the school will make some changes, I do feel this could have been avoided.
Dear “not happy”,
If you actually read my comments, you would see that I neither work for the university nor work at the university.  As stated in my response, I am a proud USC donor and alumnus.
You need to review my comments instead of making incorrect assumptions.
In my previous comments, I was responding to a parent who clearly has not been to the campus.  Honestly, can you build walls and gates any higher around a school without it looking like East Berlin?  I think USC has done a superb job of both maintaining a collegiate architecture while securing the campus.
There has been little information published by DT regarding the event.  However, it appears to me that the incident did not even occur at the Tudor Event Center.  It occurred by one report 100 yards away from the Center, which would mean that it didn’t occur at the Tudor Center at all!
Regarding your stance on the party, what in the world does that party have to do with the shooting?  Was the criminal actually invited by the BSA group?  Somehow, I doubt it.  Do you have some information that the criminal was partying in the building with the BSA group and then suddenly popped his caps?  Somehow, I doubt that is the actual scenario also.  My guess is that the peabrain crook uncorked his weapon at some distance from Tudor Center but that for some reason the media latched onto the name Tudor Center based upon needing an easy story line.  I know journalists and they’ll run with that type of story line even before they have the facts checked.  It obvious that the fact checking hasn’t occurred because Tudor center’s front patio is only about 20 yards at the most.
It is quite easy to say that USC should not have allowed this event.  But, as a student at USC for many years, I hosted many events on campus.  The campus proceeds with the assumption of trust and relationships.  It does not proceed on the assumption that a violent crime is about to occur.  It is a good thing that USC proceeds with the assumption of trust because that trust is what builds the ability to collaborate and innovate.  If you have a social structure based upon mistrust and skepticism, you’ll kill innovation and destroy the academic environment.
As I stated previously, there were several incidents during my time at USC.  Looking back, I did feel uncomfortable with those incidents, but I also trusted the USC security and LA County and LA City law enforcement personnel to control the situation.  In this case, just like the others, not only did the local law enforcement personnel handle the situation, they got the perpetrators involved.
Short of closing campus, installing metal detectors, and halting all social gatherings, what criteria would be used to “not have allowed this event to take place”?
My own parents met at a USC hosted dance many decades ago.  So, are we saying that non-USC students are no longer permitted on campus?
The overreaction is knee jerk.  This is an isolated case.  And, I disagree with the assertion that USC could have avoided the incident.  For pete’s sake people, USC’s administration had no relationship with the assailant!  They didn’t know the criminal as a student or staff.  Therefore, how could Nikias or any member of the BoD do anything about this event?  
If they declined Black Student Assembly, what would the basis of the rejection be?  That it’s a “Black” event and therefore shouldn’t meet on “our” campus?  Is that really what some “people” are trying to say here?  Such a suggestion is appalling.
Yes, I’ll go there…and don’t run from the discussion either “parent”.  I’ll say it because I’m not afraid of discussing the race card in the context of USC.
USC is one of the premiere universities of the nation.  USC has one of the longest histories in the United States of America of bringing opportunity to EVERY person REGARDLESS of ethnicity.  USC has a diverse leadership team, student body, and academic teaching cadre.  You can go across every department in every school at USC and find people of EVERY walk of life, culture, religion, skin color, and political perspective.  That is what an international institution of higher learning is about…diversity of opinion and maturity of discussion.
The diversity of USC is its very strength.  USC is not in 1960’s Alabama and 1950’s Arkansas.  USC consistently gives people opportunity based upon merit not race.  USC should be applauded for these progressive positions which help build the future of California.
For those parents so distressed, USC has more security procedures than most communities in America.  USC’s security personnel consistently protect the students.  I see USC Security personnel accompanying the athletic teams and spirit units while those teams and units are in movement to and from university events.  
You refer to your “children” in your comments, but may I point out that your “children” are adults?  They are adults when they enter the campus and are responsible for their own choices on campus and off, which is the point people are making.  You make your own choices.  My point above was that some parents are acting like the “empty nest” needs to be filled.  LA is a big city.  If you want small town learning, there are plenty of liberal arts schools in small college towns to fit the need.  But, I did not want to learn about things at a small liberal arts town.  I wanted to learn at the big time university that leads in many areas.
I can say that USC did more to protect my interests than I even realized when I was student at USC.  I can only hope that the same processes are in place twenty years later.  I believe that they are.
USC’s administration clearly has a role to play regarding safety of facilities, personnel, and clearly students.  But, do you seriously think that walling off the campus from “outsiders” can be effectively legislated?
And, yes, I meant what I said above.  If someone doesn’t think that USC is doing enough, you can always pull your support and go to Pepperdine or UCLA.  Given the decades history involved with philanthropy in Southern Califronia, USC certainly has teamed with the most philanthropic leaders to build the premier campus in Southern California.  I’m proud of the work that these people have done.  I’m offended that some would attempt to tear that work down based upon the action of a lone gunman.
Do the frazzled mothers here seriously believe that UC Irvine, Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA, or Pepperdine are any less vulnerable to violent crime than USC?  Do you seriously argue that USC’s Board of Directors or executive management are responsible to know that a violent criminal unknown to the university (i.e. neither student nor staff) carries a concealed weapon at midnight and discharges it at a midnight event and then notify the student body on campus in a shorter amount of time than 29 minutes?
Firstly, I’d be outraged if I had a daughter walking campus at midnight.  For crying out loud, it’s LA and its dark at midnight.  It shouldn’t take a USC education to figure out that LA at midnight is not that safe.
Secondly, if I had a student who was at a party at midnight instead of getting ready for 8 AM classes, I’d be more upset with the fact that they were not being responsible first.
Thirdly, at 11:40 PM on a college weeknight, I was stuck in the library still trying to figure out chemical reactions, memorize that damn biochemistry professor’s last 3 lectures, and then trying to review the impact of Citizen Kane on Hollywood.  My 2 AM to 4 AM  assignment was attempting to complete a review on the development of economic zones in Eastern China.  If someone tried to reach me from 8 PM to 1 AM , I was never reachable.  I was so buried in the work that even if cell phones existed at the time, I doubt that the coverage would have been existant.  Does USC have wireless networks installed across campus?  How would a student in their dorm at Pardee even know what was going on at the Lyon Center?  And, how does USC Administration notify tens of thousands about a security event without causing undue panic and creating more issues in the process of notification?
I remain very surprised at the outrage regarding this 29 minute process.  I can not legitimately see how the information could be obtained, vetted, and dispensed any faster.
Instead of hurling insults and asking for an inquiry, shouldn’t we be thinking about how to protect ourselves first and how to protect our neighbors second from violent criminals having nothing to do with USC in first place?
Or, are we really just looking for justification to express parental angst regarding the empty nest?
FIGHT ON!
Look, you can see my comments to the above post about the 29-minute thing. Let me just say this—try as you might, you won’t be able to understand my (or other students’) position on it. Our perspectives are just too different, and you will not be able to empathize with the addiction to information that we have. For better or worse, though, USC must face students who have expectations different from yours.
And nice rah-rah for USC in the middle of your post. Let’s be real—some of what you said was false. We all know about VKC’s inclinations in the 1930s/1940s. Coincidental that he left in 1947? I think not.
@Anonymous –
If you honestly think the political leanings of VKC is relevant to USC 2012, you’re really grasping at straws.  Most of the USC alumni and donor base are not major donors.  Most are small time donors and alumni who genuinely care about the university.
The reason I started posting on this thread was to balance out DT’s coverage from the stand point of just one alumnus who has doubled back to the university and is sending financially to the university.
Since the questions I raised were not answered by you, one can only surmise that either you just don’t like the facts or that you don’t actually have an answer to the questions.  In either case, the debate is over. 
Fight on.
I was in Leavey Library at the time of the shooting. For those of you who don’t know campus, it’s a stone’s throw away from VKC (where one of the victims was treated) and about a 3 minute walk from the Campus Center. We suddenly see the ambulances and fire trucks storm through McCarthy quad and know something is up. Of course, our generation immediately heads to Twitter to find the most up-to-date information. A shooting at Campus Center. The suspect has fled on foot. 
29 minutes later we receive an alert (I received mine ten minutes later than a peer next to me.) “A shooting was reported in the area of the campus center. Shelter in place and avoid opening doors.” 
Let me reiterate, 29 minutes later!
I could have walked, (or worse, the suspect at large) back and forth from the campus center to Leavey Library 10 times before I’d even be notified by the “Trojan Alert” system. Let’s take a frightening flashback to the Virginia Tech shooting of last year. 33 killed in a University Library. 
Don’t you think USC/LAPD should have sent an officer to stand in front of the main library entrance?
Or how about give a short address on the PA loudspeaker ensuring our safety?
How about any instructions at all? 
Nothing. Not a word. Not a security guard/DPS officer/LAPD officer in sight. In fact, I walked in and out of the library without my ID even being checked twice between 11-2am. I’m glad that they are using the PA system efficiently to make sure we secure our bikes to the racks, but not to tell us that we are safe inside and to stay put. Some students stayed while others left. At 2am, Twitter reports said the suspect was caught but the campus was still on “Lockdown.” I walked to my car and drove off without a DPS guard checking my ID, or even asking me pull down my window. Could the shooter/other members of his gang been in the car behind me fleeing? Who knows? 
I’m not a complainer. In fact, I’ve never written on the Daily Trojan forum in 4 years here. But last night USC did not do its job of making me feel secure. They sent late vague text alerts, abandoned me and my peers with no direction, and lost a lot of my trust. Last week LAPD cited me $300 for Jaywalking. I think they should get their priorities in order…
My sympathies go out to the victims and I wish them a speedy recovery. 
Let me reiterate. I love USC. I love the Trojan Family. I wouldn’t trade my decision to go here for all the money in the world. But last night, USC, you betrayed me. If only I was hungrier and wanted to grab a bite from one of the campus center eateries an hour before. If only.
THE PERP WAS A MURDERER!
It would be helpful to take note of what was involved: the individual, the perpetrator was someone that willfully took a gun to a place, with the will and mind to inflict harm and death.  The perp shot the victim 7 times, with shots lodged to the chest.  This criminal was willing to inflict death on another person (and we are all lucky that nothing like that happened).
As much of the criticism posted here has its place, we have to be aware that the problem resides with the disturbed person that was willing to murder another person.  That person could enact their rage and their violence at any time and onto anyone and with anything.  The point is USC, the administration of USC and any other constituency has no responsibility in the “perp being a murderer!”
No amount of shrill behavior, no amount of anger, no amount of recriminations is going to undo whatever made this person a murderer, willing to inflict harm on others.  No amount of prevention, modification to life’s environment is going to be full-proof to prevent such a person enacting their willful desire to harm another.
Where does the blame end?  Do we blame the community for allowing such a person to freely drive within miles of the campus?  Do we blame the city for allowing such a miscreant to reside within its borders?  What about the state or the country?  Where does the line get drawn?
Because there are no lines!  No one surreptitiously is going to “mark” such a person and throw him out!  There is no way to “read the mind” of such persons.  You can take away the gun and you can not invite him, but that does not mean such a person will not still show up some day with the same will to murder!
Yes, to the criticism regarding the management of the event and associated policies.  But NO to the anger directed at the administration.  That anger should be directed to someone that is selfish and depraved and willing to harm and if possible, murder another person.  That person deserves ALL the anger!
I heartily agree with the statement above.
It’s time we take responsibility ourselves and allow the legal process to hold the perpetrators who did this to the victims and USC accountable.
Fight on!
Thanks for replying to my comment.  Sorry that you have some surly and ugly comments posted to your thoughtful analysis.  Interesting and telling that ugly behavior is moderated and posted!  
Additionally, I constructed another comment that was careful and added value to the argument and was in no way ugly toward another person but reflective of the events and added more analysis.
THAT comment was deleted.  
So we keep ugly comments that take no time to write.  And moderate and delete comments that are constructive.  So you have ugly people commenting with rude, thoughtless behavior and acceptance of it by the moderators.
Mr. Nikias, this seems to be beyond your abilities. You need someone in charge here to take accountability. I for one am waiting for something besides “We Must Continue to Support Each Other as Members of the Trojan Family” You are losing my support Mr. Nikias. I suggest you decide what’s more important: your committment to your students or your committment to the outsiders. If you continue to blur the line between usc and “the Neighborhood” maybe you should look for another job. There is a distinct difference between those that pay your salary and those that do not.
Care to explain your definition of “outsiders”?
Can you also explain your definition of “blur the line between USC and “the Neighborhood”?
Given that I am a donor, are you?
I’ll define if for him: “outsiders” are the people who don’t pay to feel safe on USC’s campus. You love to claim that you’re a donor—I hope you’re important enough to effect some change in the management here. Regardless of silly terms like “the neighborhood” (I still haven’t seen it, since I’ve never walked south of the Coliseum, east of Figueroa, or norther of Adams and I’ve been west of Vermont more than three times in four years), questioning to whom USC is accountable is valid. I’d say it’s the people who give it money. Maybe you disagree. If so, I hope you don’t bother to vote on Tuesday. (Sorry for the ad hominem attack—I couldn’t resist.)
Also—you used “given” poorly. Read some formal logic books. They’re fun.
Cheap shots and no answers to the questions posed.
You should drop your logic book and go find a debate coach.
You’ve lost your argument because you don’t have supportable comments to off set the questions I raised.
Are you even really a USC student?
Alumus and Donor,
Thank you for your donations to the university. It is clear that you are passionate about being a Trojan, as are many of the current students who are responding to this article. 
You are from a different generation than we are — as someone has already pointed out — and our expectations of response to events like shootings in the middle of campus appears to be quite different. We have grown up in a technological age of instantaneous information. Not only did the administration fail in the amount of time it took to alert students (I did not even receive a text from Trojan Alerts, which I am signed up for. Thankfully people I was with did), but President Nikias is failing us in his lies and lack of transparency. 
I agree with the livid parent. I am a livid student. In my time at USC, there have been two students murdered by gunfire, another shot through the hand, and now an actual shooting occurring on campus. This is all within the last year and a half. I would think that the off-campus shootings would have urged the administration towards more stringent on-campus policies, but all signs point to “no.” Lots of people are dismissing this as an isolated incident. I hope it is, but I don’t see how you can necessarily say that when the event occurred two days ago. Yes, it was the shooter who actually shot the gun, but he should not have been on-campus wielding a gun at 11:30pm on a week night. There’s no reason for him to have been here.
Your being a donor does not give your opinion more authority than those of us who are currently studying at the university. And actually, the people you are condescending towards do give a significant chunk of money to the university each year — at this point it hovers around $60,000. 
I understand that you think the administration is doing everything in its power to keep us safe. I don’t agree with you. As someone else sort of discussed, we are written up for riding our bikes inadvertently on the wrong side of the street or yelled at for being on the wrong part of Trousdale: I think safety priorities are a little out of whack.
@Anon
I do not frankly care if you think I am looking for “more authority” because I am not.  Your raising that straw man is a obfuscation of the discussion.  You might be feeling like you are attempting to curry the favor of any reader, but you are not.
Not only do I stand on the assertion regarding USC’s consistent and long-term commitment to achievement based merit, but I also would like to assert that the underlying racial overtone in the discussion is highly inappropriate.  Hence, my commentary posted above is made without any retraction.  USC is without question among the institutions in the United States that has consistently focused on merit based reward and open academic discussion regardless of ethnicity.
If you really need to question it, just look at your alumni and the football fans opposite your student section at the games.  There’s a multi-ethnic crowd in the Coliseum and I’m not talking about the ticket holders near the score board.  I’m talking about the donor section at mid field!  Those people are multi ethnic, professional, trained, show up early, get a fast start, and mean what we say.
If you guys think a 29 minute lag between an event and a text based notification was too slow, go investigate it and post the solution.  Whining about the delay and claiming that you were in the library and should have been told is ridiculous.  If you are a USC student, you should be posting the answer to the problem as a recommendation.  Instead, I see cheap shots at the administration, claims that parents want to pull their kids, and then claims that a generation gap exists.  Oh really?  If you feel that way about it, go to UCLA and sit in a class room of 3 times too many students with professors who are disgruntled and underpaid.
I also do not believe that your opinion is any less or more valuable than mine.  The fact that you attempt this argument shows a complete lack of debate skill, hardly Trojan.  Sorry if I sound like a law professor or a debate coach, but if we’re going to be running our keyboards off about the university, please do argue the point instead of attempting to make me a straw man.
The attitude that has sprouted on DT’s bulletin board regarding this shooting is the most troublesome, condescending and inappropriate comments that I’ve seen in my 25 years as a Trojan.
The reality is that USC has consistently and clearly stood for merit based academics and advancement.
Attempting to paint the responses here as being “student” versus “administration” is frankly absurd.  Both student body and administration have a common interest with regards to campus security.  Has it ever occurred to you that violent crime in major metropolitan cities has been an issue for 60 years?  Is this rate of violent crime really much different than 20 years ago?
My answer to you is simple.  It’s no.  NO, the violent crime rate is not much different in LA than NYC, Washington DC, Baltimore, Dallas, Seattle, San Francisco, or Boston.  You can talk New Haven and Yale, Cambridge and Harvard, Palo Alto and Stanford, or Pasadena and Cal Tech.  If you want that environment, go to it.
I have not given a “bye week” to USC Admin.  They have clearly already responded to these threats and are continuing to escalate response.
Current students at USC have much to be concerned about, and their personal safety should be understood to be the highest priority for USC leadership.
In talking with other university donors in the past weekend, it is clear that USC security has significantly tightened since Halloween.  In fact, I know donors who had to give their names and information at the guard gates.  It’s frankly sad that USC has to close its walls and gates like a kingdom protecting those inside from outside the moat.
Earlier in this thread, I challenged others to post their suggestion on how to legislate the events better.  I have neither seen a comment in response nor seen an answer on legislation.
I stand by my comments.
USC is by far one of the fairest and best universities in the nation when it comes to being focused on the abilities and behavior of individuals.

Geno Hall, a former Crenshaw High School football star and 2009 L.A. City Football Player of the Year, was recovering from seven bullet wounds in critical but stable condition Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Eugene Hall, Geno’s father, told the Times that his son was recovering from a three-hour surgery in the intensive care unit of California Hospital Medical Center. The younger Hall sustained bullet wounds to the left thigh, back of leg, buttocks and arm, according to his father.
“The doc says he’ll pull through but they’re keeping him up there,” Eugene Hall told the Times.
Geno Hall was the intended victim of the shooting that occurred outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center late Wednesday night. Three others were also admitted to California Hospital with minor injuries. None of the victims or suspects were affiliated with the university, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
LAPD officials said they expect the other three victims to make a full recovery.
I’m glad to hear that the person targeted by the shooting has survived and is recovering, as have the bystanders injured in the attack.
If we were characterize this shooting as a targeted attack on a (somewhat) public figure, this incident would be scarier, but less indicative of a security lapse at the university.
Targeted assassination attempts could be more difficult to mitigate than, say, muggings (though less a risk to the university as a whole) because such an attacker would be more determined, and perhaps less concerned about getting caught.
Saying something like, “I told you so that USC is in a bad neighborhood!” or, even worse, saying something racist, is misidentifying the problem.

Most people associate choirs with churches and traditional, sacred music but the Los Angeles Master Chorale defies the “choir” stereotype as it leads audience members on a musical journey. LAMC is an integral part of the city; cited by the Los Angeles Times as “a major cultural asset,” the choir is currently in its 49th season. Far from resting on its laurels, LAMC is constantly changing and growing.
Under the direction of USC Thornton School of Music graduate Grant Gershon, LAMC has been called “the nation’s, and maybe the world’s, most innovative choral group” on the CultureSpotLA blog. Gershon graduated cum laude from Thornton with a bachelor’s in piano performance and currently serves on the USC Thornton Board of Advisors. Gershon credits his experience at USC with helping to shape his self-proclaimed “eclectic” musical tastes. As a student, Gershon participated in a rock band, various jazz ensembles and USC’s Chamber Singers.
Gershon advises students to “get out there and create opportunities,” conceding that as a student there are times when you “fall on your face” but that the experience is worthwhile and enriching. Though LAMC does not offer formal programs for USC students, Gershon feels there is a “natural” connection between USC’s Chamber Singers and LAMC. Aside from his personal connection, many other chorale members are also former Chamber Singers.
LAMC is dedicated to sharing music, the Times states that “while other organizations focus on performing and listening, LAMC helps kids create and collaborate.” The “Voices Within” program gives local fifth and sixth graders the access to musical professionals who help them create and perform original compositions for a live audience. LAMC is also involved with high school students through the Walt Disney Hall High School Choral Festival. Instead of a traditional choral completion, the students form one choir, which Gershon feels is a testament to the unifying power of song and the universality of music.
In keeping with the idea of sharing music, audience members have the opportunity to attend the Listen Up! pre-concert talk and to gain a deeper understanding of the performance they are about to experience. Gershon explained the concert’s theme of “ascension” and illustrated his points with the piano and his voice. He said he felt passionate about the music and “really lucky” to be able to “choose the music that he loves.” Gershon said the audience is becoming “less musically conservative” in that they “expect the unexpected at LAMC concerts.”
The Master Chorale’s premiere did not disappoint. The Walt Disney Concert Hall organ accompanied the chorale as it performed a mix of modern and traditional pieces in the English Cathedral style.
The Chorale opened triumphantly with a traditional selection, “God is Gone Up” by Gerald Finzi. Besides making a grand entrance, this piece presented the sonorous rumblings of the concert hall’s grand organ.
Next, the Chorale performed Nico Muhly’s “Bright Mass with Canons.” The canons created textual overlap and close harmonies. The piece mirrored a church mass in its structure as well as its sound; Muhly used grand chords and cascading voices to make a sonic picture of a cathedral.
After the impressive “Bright Mass,” the chorale transitioned to “Beatitudes.” Unlike the previous piece, the text, not the music was the focus. The chorale used a darker, more meditative sound that allowed listeners to connect with the text of the beatitudes.
Paul Mealor’s “Ubi Caritas” provide a refreshing break from the introspective “Beatitudes.” Mealor’s piece, a modern composition of the traditional “Ubi Caritas,” debuted at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s royal wedding. His arrangement provided complex layers of sound so that the audience hardly noticed the lack of accompaniment. A delicate solo by the Los Angeles Children’s Choir tempered the full and regal sound of the chorale. “Ubi Caritas” seemed to be an audience favorite, bringing members to their feet.
In keeping with the spirit, the chorale finished the first act with Sir Hubert Parry’s “I Was Glad.” This piece provided a joyously thundering close to the first act.
After the intermission, the Los Angeles Children’s Choir joined the Master Chorale to perform Nico Muhly’s “A Good Understanding.” This piece featured sustained treble notes and wove the children’s voices into a rich tapestry with the Master Chorale. Afterward, the children’s choir performed “Psalm 150” on their own. This short piece showcased light, bouncing melodies, fitting for younger voices.
The Master chorale returned and treated listeners to Tarik O’Regan’s “Dorchester Canticles.” In addition to the organ, the “Canticles” included harp and percussion accompaniment. This soaring and robust piece truly highlighted the masterful blending and precise intonation of the chorale.
Kurt Weill’s “Kiddush,” described as a “palate cleanser” by Gershon, broke from the English cathedral theme. Originally commissioned by the Park Avenue temple in New York, this selection featured a solo tenor cantor as well as Hebrew text and lively accompaniment. The chorale’s emotional performance sounded inviting and smooth as velvet.
The chorale returned to the concert’s theme of ascension with Judith Weir’s “Ascending into Heaven.” Described as “equal parts lightness, wisdom and imagination” this selection left listeners floating. It highlighted the chorale’s vocal control through sweeping glissandos and dynamic changes. Like a swirling mass of clouds, the voices soared and swooped into the heavens, ending with a rumbling organ chord.
The chorale included an encore performance of “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” This melodic and hopeful piece contrasted with the more abstract “Ascending into Heaven” and provided the perfect close to the Master Chorale’s performance.
LAMC, under the direction of Gershon, took listeners on a soaring musical journey. The upward motion of the selections truly fit the theme of ascension and highlighted the chorale’s versatility, proving that choirs can be innovative and that even traditional music is not static.

The Los Angeles Police Department has detained two suspects following a shooting that injured four people near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at approximately 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday, according to campus authorities.
Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Only one of the four victims is in critical condition and as of approximately 2 a.m. was undergoing surgery at California Hospital Medical Center, according to LAPD. Three others were injured and immediately transported to California Hospital as well. Neither the suspects, whom LAPD identified as approximately 19-years-old, nor the victims were affiliated with USC.Classes across the university are scheduled to continue as normal Thursday.
The shooting occurred about 100 yards from a Halloween costume party, “Freak or Greek,” which was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s ballroom. The event, which began at 9 p.m., was hosted by a USC student organization and LA Hype, a night life and entertainment group. The party drew a crowd of about 1,500, according to the Dept. of Public Safety.
“We were waiting outside to get into the party, and we were waiting for a while — maybe 20 or 30 minutes,” said Olivia Gordon, a freshman majoring in psychology. “And all of the sudden, as soon as people started going inside, there were multiple gunshots and everyone who was in line for the party ducked and we all ran.”
A confrontation occurred between two unidentified males, which led one to shoot the other, inadvertently injuring three others in the process, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. The intended victim was shot three to four times in the torso, according to LAPD Cmdr. Bob Green. The other three victims did not sustain life-threatening injuries.
“I heard three gunshots … there might have been more than that,” said Christina Nour, a freshman majoring in civil engineering building science. “Then I ducked. It didn’t feel real. It felt like it was a movie because I really haven’t experienced anything like this before. I was running as fast as I can, trying to make sure I didn’t get trampled or tripped. I just ran as fast as I could, as far as I could.”
Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs, released a statement on the university’s website, saying DPS had been monitoring the area near the party. He also noted the importance of ensuring safety.
“This incident reminds us that we must look out for ourselves and be particularly vigilant about the personal safety of friends and guests at our social events,” Jackson said.
After the shooting, officers at the scene identified the shooter as well as an unidentified male who was fleeing the scene with him. Officers followed the two to Parking Lot 6 and detained them; they also retrieved the handgun used in the shooting from the ground at the lot.
DPS issued a Trojan Alert at 12:02 a.m. on Thursday, asking students to take “shelter in place and avoid opening doors for unknown persons.” DPS and LAPD also immediately cordoned off the area near the shooting, including from Bovard Auditorium to Mudd Hall and from the Campus Center to the eastern edge of Hahn Plaza. The entire University Park Campus was locked down soon after.
Despite the lockdown, LAPD said the event in the Campus Center continued even as the shooting and its aftermath unfolded outside.
“Music continued to play, and they continued to party,” Green said.
At approximately 2 a.m., DPS and LAPD opened the campus to students, faculty and staff with USC identification. The entire campus was reopened at 4:52 a.m.
Assistant DPS Chief John Thomas said that the incident was not indicative of the overall level of safety in and around USC.
“[USC has] a great partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department. We are one of the safest campuses in the country — we make sure that we have the necessary resources at the event, we do necessary planning and unfortunately [the shooting] happened outside,” he said. “These are individuals that unfortunately came here and decided to disrupt what otherwise would have been a very peaceful event, like all of our events on campus.”
USC needs to stop allowing locals anywhere near campus.  Throw political correctness aside. USC needs to accept the fact that South Central is a war zone and secure the campus appropriately.
USC needs to start spending more money on hiring campus police to help better patrol and protect campus.  In my opinion USC is one of the top schools in the country in a great city.  USC is not the only school in the country with students being shot.  Virginia Tech has had two major shooting by a serial killer and Baylor a private college in the state of Texas had basketball players shot other people on campus.  USC gets a bad rep because the campus is in the heart of LA but colleges all around the country have crime and shootings.  USC does need to spend more money on hiring law enforcement officers.  I have never had a problem on campus.
Crime and bullets have no name or address!! Just look at the movie theater shooting in a nice neighborhood in Colorado or all the high school shootings in nice neighborhoods. Crime does not only happen in the inner city but also in nice gang free places.
USC does not and never has employed campus police.  The California State schools (i,e. CSUN, CSULA, Cal Poly Pomona) and University of California schools (i.e. UCLA, UC Berkeley) have campus police departments.  USC, LMU, University of San Diego and other PRIVATE schools employ BSIS licensed security guards.
In California, private schools are prohibited from creating their own police police agency.
The simple solution is to follow the Stanford model and partner with Sheriff Leroy Baca who can deputize USC DPS staff and make them deputy sheriffs.  When/if he authorizes that, USC DPS would have law enforcement authority.  This model is already in use in Los Angeles County at the Community Colleges, see: http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/ccc_srv1.html.
The next time you see one of our DPS ‘officers’ think Securitas or Wakenhut.  Just don’t fall for the myth they are police.  Lower your expectations and welcome back to reality!
I am a new USC parent.   I received a call from my son at midnight last night to let me know he was safe, but I did not sleep all night.  I think the USC community should be given details and answers immediately.  For starters, was this a gang/drug related situation?  The news says Geno was the “intended victim.”  Sounds like a gang hit.  
Did a half hour lapse after the shooting before the students were warned by text to stay inside?
Who do we contact?  Should we organize a meeting?
Hi Claire. 
Below from Neon Tommy–a point of contact for you. Accountability is crucial:
“After numerous calls—and in-person requests—for comment to university officials, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent the media an email saying the following:
“…The event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween.”
Hi Claire. 
See my reference below regarding a USC contact for you.
Let’s be realistic here. University officials, DPS, and LAPD would not be able to immediately get those details to us, they would not know right away if this was gang/drug-related. They may have speculations of course, but they would not, and should not, say anything without confirmation of the facts. I think the details that they did give out were the most important ones, to let students know of the shooting, that a suspect had been apprehended, and most importantly, when the threat was over. I’m sure they are working on the other details and will let everyone know when they are confident every fact they have is correct. You wouldn’t want journalists reporting false speculation for the sake of appeasing people and “breaking” the news first, so why would you expect university officials to do so as well?
All I am suggesting is that students be alerted in a timely way there is an incident in the heart of campus that warrants taking measures to secure their safety. Once a shot is fired on campus and several are confirmed to be shot, there is not a need for any information other than “take cover”. Yes, it could have been gang related or a personal reprisal. No one knows at this point, but as of the shooting the possibility of reprisals or other responses providing danger to USC students could not be ruled out. Yet, students were unaware of any occurrence for 29 or more minutes. I am sure you and others can readily think of ways to inform students of a potentially dangerous in the heart of the campus in less that 29, or more for some, minutes.
We decided to block you…Meow!
I agree with David and others that blame the USC administration. A third party sponsors an on campus party that atracts 1500 persons inside and 500 others milling about outside waiting to get in. There were only 14 DPS officers assigned to the event.
Isn’t that already a recipe for disaster? Heads should roll.
Welcome to the jungle (aka Los Angeles).  As I was typing my last post regarding the incident (my nephew is currently a student at SC), I hear helicopters and loud sirens outside our building (on mid-Wilshire).  I look outside from the 25th floor and see cop cars, ambulances and news vans outside on Wilshire Blvd.  Apparently, a girl was shot outside across the street from our building in front of a B/A.   I pray that she makes it and that the gunman is apprehended.  Its a crazy world we live in these days.  TO EVERYONE PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND VIGILANT ALL THE TIME.
To add insult to injury – this afternoon at the corner of 30th and Orchard (a common location many students pass through, to and from campus) there were TWO LAPD officers staked out  caddy-corner. Their primary function – stop the dangerous scourge to society known as the BICYCLIST that does not come to a complete stop at the stop sign. ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME!!!!!!! I saw one of these officers ticket a girl because she just rode her bike without coming to a full and complete stop at the stop sign. Again, SHE WAS ON A BICYCLE!!!!!! In this retarded city of LA, if you want to tag other people’s property and gun down four people in the middle of a campus where students pay an arm and a leg to attend – well then of course as the shooter you are the victim since obviously you come from a repressed society that caused you to be a criminal…however, if you pay outrageous taxes and tuition – well watch out because the LAPD still want to squeeze more money out of you for riding a bicycle like any other human being in any other city in this country. LA is run by retarded monkeys looking to turn it into a gang infested, third world welfare state. Parents, save your money and send your kids to UCLA. The chances of them not getting shot or raped is better and you will not be pumping money into the retarded City Council and Mayor who can only bang the race card drum and not be happy until LA becomes more like a third world barrio.
Ras,
The law even applies to pretty white girls on bikes
Nice rant, Ras. Was she also going the wrong way? Bicycle safety means that cyclists must also obey traffic rules. It’s for your own safety.
My point is I would rather police resources be spent going after gang banging thugs gunning ppl down instead of a chick on a bike. I will take my chances with the chick on the bike but I will not be so evenly matched with armed ghetto monkeys.
Check your facts and read this!
USC needs to start spending more money on hiring campus police to help better patrol and protect campus.  In my opinion USC is one of the top schools in the country in a great city.  USC is not the only school in the country with students being shot.  Virginia Tech has had two major shooting by a serial killer and Baylor a private college in the state of Texas had basketball players shot other people on campus.

Crime and bullets have no name or address!! Just look at the movie theater shooting in a nice neighborhood in Colorado or all the high school shootings in nice neighborhoods. Crime does not only happen in the inner city but also in nice gang free places.
The problem I see is that Campus Security are a bunch of wimps.  Let LAPD have access to the inside of campus at least with LAPD no one and I repeat no one will try to mess with any of these cops.  DPS is useless, they will not stop you they just collect their paychecks.  THUGS, GANGBANGERS are not afraid of Campus Security, DPS or anything that pretends to be cops.  LAPD is the solution to this problem.  Give LAPD officers access to patrol the campos, have an LAPD substation 1/s block from campus.  Thats it.  No other solutions.  Let LAPD be in charge.
I was in Leavey Library at the time of the shooting. For those of you who don’t know campus, it’s a stone’s throw away from VKC (where one of the victims was treated) and about a 3 minute walk from the Campus Center. We suddenly see the ambulances and fire trucks storm through McCarthy quad and know something is up. Of course, our generation immediately heads to Twitter to find the most up-to-date information. A shooting at Campus Center. The suspect has fled on foot.
29 minutes later we receive an alert (I received mine ten minutes later than a peer next to me.) “A shooting was reported in the area of the campus center. Shelter in place and avoid opening doors.”
Let me reiterate, 29 minutes later!
I could have walked, (or worse, the suspect at large) back and forth from the campus center to Leavey Library 10 times before I’d even be notified by the “Trojan Alert” system. Let’s take a frightening flashback to the Virginia Tech shooting of last year. 33 killed in a University Library.
Don’t you think USC/LAPD should have sent an officer to stand in front of the main library entrance?
Or how about give a short address on the PA loudspeaker ensuring our safety?
How about any instructions at all?
Nothing. Not a word. Not a security guard/DPS officer/LAPD officer in sight. In fact, I walked in and out of the library without my ID even being checked twice between 11-2am. I’m glad that they are using the PA system efficiently to make sure we secure our bikes to the racks, but not to tell us that we are safe inside and to stay put. Some students stayed while others left. At 2am, Twitter reports said the suspect was caught but the campus was still on “Lockdown.” I walked to my car and drove off without a DPS guard checking my ID, or even asking me pull down my window. Could the shooter/other members of his gang been in the car behind me fleeing? Who knows?
I’m not a complainer. In fact, I’ve never written on the Daily Trojan forum in 4 years here. But last night USC did not do its job of making me feel secure. They sent late vague text alerts, abandoned me and my peers with no direction, and lost a lot of my trust. Last week LAPD cited me $300 for Jaywalking. I think they should get their priorities in order…
My sympathies go out to the victims and I wish them a speedy recovery.
Let me reiterate. I love USC. I love the Trojan Family. I wouldn’t trade my decision to go here for all the money in the world. But last night, USC, you betrayed me. If only I was hungrier and wanted to grab a bite from one of the campus center eateries an hour before. If only.
The problem is see is that Campus Security or DPS or whatever you want to call those wimps are basically useless.  Gangbangers and thugs are not scared a bit of these clowns.  Let LAPD patrol the inside of campus, put a substation of LAPD inside campus.  Believe me, security is useless they do not scare the enemy.  But, LAPD will shut these clowns.   Please Mr. Nikias pull the trigger and let LAPD PATROL THE INSIDE OF CAMPUS.
LAPD does patrol on the inside of campus…maybe you should actually visit once in a while
And when LAPD patrols the campus do violent crimes happen.  My question is where there LAPD cops the night of this event?   Outsiders are not scared of campus police or DPS because they know that their powers to arrest with force is limited.  This is Los Angeles, not a college town in the midwest or some rural area.   Career gang members and thugs know this.  As a student the presence of campus security may scare you, but not gang bangers.  To them campus offcers are just security guards.  I have been to campus to visit my nephew and see locals skateboarding on campus.  I can tell they don’t go to school at SC because they’re not even old enough to be on college.  What do the campus police do? NOTHING.
USC does not have nor employ campus police.  USC DPS are security guards licensed by BSIS.  They are NOT police, have no authority off campus.  If they were police, it would say so on their website and on their cars and uniforms.  They would also be licensed by California Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST).  Do NOT take my word for it, simply do a Google search or take a look at their badges and cars.
BTW: what police officer do you know of that has to have a guard card, a baton card and a gun permit issued by BSIS?
When you see DPS, think security guard.
My daughter is a sophmore at USC and  from the first day she moved on campus I noticed the lack of security particularly around the perimeter of campus and in the neighborhood off campus where the majority of USC students live.  I also have a daughter who is a junior at the Univ of Penn (an Ivy) which is also located in an urban neighborhood like USC. The security presence on campus and blocks around UPenn is far superior to USC.  As a parent, I know she is safe on and around campus.    
 USC MUST beef up security not only on campus but on the perimeter of campus and the blocks off campus where most students live.  If security presence is highly visible, it would make anyone think twice about bringing a gun on campus regardless of what type of event is being held and who is attending.  I certainly do not want this incident to be a poor reflection on the BSA and affect any future events of the BSA.   THE PROBLEM IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE LACK OF SECURITY.  AS A PARENT, I SPEND TOO MUCH IN FULL TUITION NOT TO FEEL SAFE!!!!
WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE? REALLY WHO IS IN CHARGE?
 MR. NIKIAS LOVES THE SPOTLIGHT WHEN THINGS GO WELL BUT IN HARD TIMES HE DISAPPEARS. SOME ONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WHO IS IT? DISGRACEFUL LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY.
A starting point for anyone wanting to inquire who was in charge: From Neon Tommy:
“After numerous calls—and in-person requests—for comment to university officials, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent the media an email saying the following:
“…The event in question was approved as an exception to the university’s date and time requirements because no alcohol was to be served and to allow the student group to hold an event on Halloween.”
To further exacerbate this matter, I can just see lawsuits against USC from the victims for this incident.  WHO IS IN CHARGE?
I am a recent alumnus, and I still come to campus for events like conferences and public lectures. Obviously the university can’t shut all non-USC folks out of events like those on campus.
The security issue here seems to be that someone was able to bring a firearm into a crowded area. One can only assume that the gunman must have been extremely stupid, as he was immediately apprehended. The fact is that a stupid, impulsive person could do exactly this sort of thing at LA Live, or in Times Square, where they would just as likely be immediately apprehended.
As far as prevention goes, I suppose DPS could have set up a wider security perimeter and frisked everyone for guns. I’m sure this shooting could not have occurred within the venue. Or the event could have required advance online RSVPs, to discourage people from congregating outside, waiting to get in.
I don’t think there need to be any dramatic changes to university policies, other than more fuding for special security at large-scale event like this, to be paid for by the promoters. I mean, even Art Walk has to pay the LAPD for additional security.
Wow, what happened to the Trojan Family I keep hearing about. I see the true colors coming out and it’s not USC cardinal and gold.

University policy holds that no parties after 10pm may be held during the week. This is the rule they use to HAMMER the Row into submission. Row events are generally USC only and very exclusive! Why was another campus group allowed to have an open event on campus? The campus is profiling GREEKS when it should be after the thugs. Unbelievable!
Hush hush JG, the black groups have never been held to those rules.   That’s only for the Row and those crazy white kids.
Columbia University is in Spanish Harlem, Yale in an economically disadvantaged part of New Haven, Connecticut. I have not read about violence on these campuses. As others have pointed out, perhaps we can learn from these top academic institutions since this is the echelon USC is broaching.   I suggest the same administration diligence that has shepherded USC to a top 25 (or greater) academic institution be applied to the social/safety environment. Involve all stakeholders–administration, trustees. alums, students, parents, campus security and LAPD for a careful examination and initiate change where needed. Bottom line, what are the social needs and interests of the current student body and are they being safely served by social offerings at present. Safety, security and student health would seem to be priorities for all.   
Judging from the the Playboy #2 rating and other media notoriety, a party school reputation exists for USC.  Talking to some Greeks, the party reputation is a source of pride, to others, Greek and non-Greek, it is quite the opposite. I expect a party reputation, deserved or not,  does influence who is attracted to the USC campus–both students and non-students. 
It is not clear, yet, from all I have read, if this was a Greek/non-Greek, BSA/non-BSA  or combination event. What does matter is USC allowed the event to occur. As others have pointed out, a Halloween, late night event, marketed as this one was should never have been approved. President Nikias needs to identify who did not exercise responsibility and there needs to be consequences. I agree the President Nikias “apology letter” falls far short of the mark and does little to assuage concerns of parents and alums. Perhaps there will soon me more to follow from the President’s Office.
Various posters have remarked they are no longer considering USC for their younger children and others transferring from USC. Most everyone seems to understand inherent risks in our society with guns permeating daily life. Yet, it seems some parents and others are left with the sense the social/health/safety environment at USC has not received the attention it requires–now requires urgently. I. for one, do not want to see USC lose all the benefit of the hard work to improve every aspect of its academic status to attract the best and brightest. 
I can’t imagine students or parents feel the same sense of safety following this tragedy involving Tutor Center, the symbolic heart of USC. This can and should be a defining moment for all to focus on creating an unquestionably laudable aspect of student life equally important to academic excellence–excellence in the social/safety environment.
You want a good school in a bad neighborhood, try University of Chicago.  Way worse than SC.  6 murders in surrounding area since January.
MR. NIKIAS, SECURE THIS CAMPUS, MY CHILD IS IN DANGER. I MAY JUST PULL HIM OUT!!!
Pull them out. The campus is safe, this is a random incident.
Who ever is responsible for security on our campus is an utter failure and needs to be replaced, and that would include the administration that oversees, or apparently neglects, security. This is absurd that all of this gun violence occurs on campus. WE NEED A CHANGE AT THE TOP!!!
I want a name – WHO ultimately authorized this party to take place? I want names
There are authorized on campus parties almost every day of the school year.
This is a extremely difficult racial situation.
I lament the fact that law-abiding African-American individuals out there will be ridiculed for the actions of some. However, it is a fact that all the shootings that have been occurring on or around USC have been a result of African-Americans.
But what can be done? Why kind of response can the school take such that we maintain a balance of freedom and security on campus?
Do we increase secruity dramatically?  We could, but this would be terribly inefficient and would dampen a sence of freedom on campus.
Do we have security target blacks in and around campus? One could argue that this would be more efficient as a campus as a whole, and I hate to say it but this might effectively dampen crime, but at the cost of one racial group’s freedom and rights, which I can’t in my heart approve of.
So what can we do? What can we possibly do? I don’t know.
The issue is the administration needs the community board to approve all future development so they never take the side of the victims and ostracize those who are to blame which in ALL the past few cases have been local gangs.  Armed Homeless (fact) loiter around USC owned property, the UV and all the strip malls on fig are owned by USC.  This isnt an issue of racial profiling.  It is an issue of property protection.  Unless you are a paying customer meaning students and patrons of the UV.  Get the F Out.  Ask any student if they know someone “held up” at either knife or gun point id bet money more than 75% do.
What?  Put the pipe down as it is making you slur
What part did you not get?  I understood it perfectly well.  It’s the mumbo jumbo that you had written earlier that had me confused.
Time to close the row down for good!   How many more stories do I need to read about “Greeks” gone bad?
This incident wasn’t on the row and had nothing to do with Greeks.  It was co-sponsored by a non-Greek organization and an outside party promoter!
Which non-Greek organization?  I keep reading “Greek”
Black Student Association. They’ve since scrubbed their site.
How do you know they scrubbed their site?
BSA DIDN’T SPONSOR THIS EVENT. IT NEVER WAS FUNDED BY THE ORG
As a parent of a freshman at USC, I am appalled that the security wouldn’t be tighter at an on-campus event. I drank the kool-aid at orientation parent programs where administrators assured us that campus security was tight.  How tight can it be when an event in the student center on Halloween is open to the general public?  I don’t even think admission was charged or bags were checked. Security is tighter going to a football game at the Coliseum.  I have another child in high school who wants to be a Trojan, too, but I am re-thinking my decision to send my first-born here.  All events on the Row were cancelled because administrators were concerned about drunken brawls by students which might tarnish USC academic rep when it’s trying to rid itself of its party-school rep.  I’ll stick with party-school over violent crime school!  Maybe my freshman should start the application process again — this time as a transfer!!!
This is a terrible event and I hope those hurt will be ok. However, those who say required IDs for people to enter USC has problems to it.
See the problem with required Trojan ID to enter campus is that verifying each ID for every person who passes into the parameter of USC (38,000+ enrollment plus staff) would be a logistical nightmare. How are going to check every single person that passes through by car, bus, and walking? This would considerablly impede the schools preformance and create great congestion. And what about tailgate weekend? And amping up policing and surveillance on campus, while perhaps marginally increasing security(the school is already well secured), further increases the already present sence that we’re living on a prison campus. And on top of that, these things will only provide a false sence of security. They don’t directly address a solution to the problem patterns of the shootings we’ve had: Late night, parties, events. Perhaps one solution may be to require Trojan IDs  campus events.
The shooting did not occur inside the event , it occured outside the event but on campus property. The school’s open campus policy is NOT working. I don’t agree with those who say 38,000 people having to show ID is logistically impossible . It is possible. USC has several entrances not all 38,000 people will be going through one entrance at the same time. At parents weekend I consistently saw homeless people who were going through  the USC trash cans and walking amongst the students , one even hanging around outside a residence hall exit door which was really worrying.  Two things are what parents want to see right now,
1.No more open campus policy
2.USC ID to step foot onto USC property period.
As a recent graduate, I was conflicted about those rummaging through the trash. I accepted those who wanted to pull from trash cans outdoors on campus, but was not ok with those waiting outside the residence hall doors. I always slammed the door before they could enter. I don’t care what the situation is; that’s trespassing and possible endangerment, not to mention all the stolen property reports that show up in Roundup that are found to be done by non-students.
A former student and Trojan alum of years past. Go on campus whenever I attend a sporting event or musical concert day or night even at the Galen Ctr. Security needs to be tightened, and maybe a metal detector used for these kind of parties that are open to the surrounding community. Another gun control instance that is not addressed. What is with a mid-week bash that lasts past midnight when school in session. Smart students need to stay away to avoid being caught in a situation that happened.  I am liberal as the next one, just need to use common sense when things don’t feel right.
it doesnt matter what group threw on this party. the fact that this was blatantly advertised by the promoter as a public party- someone needs to be held accountable. if this happened on the row, the row would be shut down immediatly until something changed. i dont see a double standard? (btw this was no way affiliated w greek life)  it was not about the amount of security, it was about the environment that occured bc preventative measures werent take to ensure school policy was being followed.
Why do I imagine you stuttering?
Cold Bro!

I just read President Nikias’ “Assuaging Letter”. I must say that I am weary of reading these “Dont’ worry people, everything is all right” letters from our President. 
I do not want to read, in future, what the reaction to these incidents is, I want to know now, what Mr. President is doing to prevent these occurances–very very disturbing trend under this Administration.

I am horrified at what this video depicts. Last night my son was ministering to his fraternity brothers on the Row the word of God without alcohol and without licentious women. How dare anyone associate this on campus event with the SC Greek system.
My son and I are praying for all those that were shot that they fully recover.  Those responsible shall pay the price of eternal damnation in lakes of fire!
You obviously have never been to the row on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday Night.
My son and his fraternity brothers would never be involved in such behavior.    He is a member of the top fraternity at SC and I have seen pictures and video of his fraternity’s events.   There is nothing close to what that video shows.   
I have been to the house on a Friday and Saturday night.  In fact, only a few weeks ago during Parent’s Weekend.  I took part in a prayer meeting after the football game in the dining room with nearly 20 of his fraternity brothers.   Every single one a true gentlemen and believer in His Word!
Judge not, lest you be judged!
Again my son and I are praying for all!
God Bless!
re: SC Mom w/Greek son @10:57 AM
Shhh, quiet, honey. The grownups are trying to talk about what happened. Run along and pray quietly.
I happen to be a SC graduate and have every right to comment and express my opinion.  My son and I will pray that you find peace in His Word. 
God Bless!
A midnight call from my daughter crying – shooter on campus.  Lunatics with guns may not be preventable, but this is entirely different.  My daughter said that she was terrified as she walked through the campus center last night on her way home from a project she was working on.  it was obvious to her that there was a large crowd of non-students.  DPS officers sat on there and watched, without offering to help.
This was a disaster waiting to happen.  An outside group promoted the party to anyone 18+ OR with a student ID.  This should never have been allowed.  Once the crowd scene developed with obvious non-students, the DPS should have ordered non-students off campus and arrested any that did not comply.  The university is private property and  has the right to control access.
The DPS smug attitdue that this isn’t a problem because no students, faculty or staff were involved is absolutely intolerable.  A shooter on campus is a major problem.  Frankly the attitude of DPS is bad from the top down.  Shortly after last April’s murder my daughter reported a death threat that someone made to her.  DPS treated her like it was her fault.  
President Nikias and the board of trustees have done an excellent job in raising the academic standards of USC.  Now they need to do the same with safety on campus.  The first order of business must be to start a top down attitude change and personnel change at DPS.  Perhaps other alternatives should be reviewed including eliminating DPS and hiring police services from LAPD or LASD.  Then a review of policies with changes to improve safety on and off campus.   This requires real changes to be implemented now.
Lol.
Completely and totally agree.  The undergrads laughing here don’t get it.  I’m an uncle several times over and after a few years in the working world you see how organizations REALLY operate.  This is definitely a top-down issue.
All these bullets flying and not one hit Kiffin!
None of this would have happened if the bad guys knew SC students were packing heat.
This stuff NEVER happens at UCLA. Why is that? What could possibly be the reason that UCLA (situated in west Los Angeles) and USC (situated in south central) have such stark differences in violence and crime statistics? What could it possibly be? What? SOMEBODY TELL ME!
In my view it is totally unacceptable for a university in SC’s location to allow nighttime events such as this without greater security arrangements. It is totally foreseeable that a Halloween party open to the public after midnight will draw outsiders whom are armed and could harm other attendees.
At a minimum, such events, if even allowed, have such a strong potential to draw an unsavory crowd a significantly greater level of security is essential, such as metal detectors at campus entrances.
It would make sense for the event sponsor to cover these costs if it is open to non students. Where is the 7% tuition increase being spent… Certainly not to beef up security.
What astounds me is the level of raczism ehibited by the commentators on this board.  If this had been a white party on 28th Street you all would have said “let boys be boys”.  But since this event involved African American males you are up in arms.  I have attended many SC Hype events over the years.  And yes, I like to get my freak on.  Don’t point the finger at the black man you fear.  Look in the mirror and see that the enemy is you.
Four people haven’t been shot at a “white party on 28th Street” though
Not yet?
It is so funny when I hear super liberal people say we all should ignore obvious trends and problems that are right in front of our eyes – and ignore them because they are so obvious!
Yes – If white frat boys are constantly tagging other people’s property and shooting each other for wearing blue or red and it is a constant ongoing problem – then yes society would also stereotype them as well. Stop using political correctness as a cowardly way to avoid confronting the problme that is clearly in front of your nose!
Outrageous lack of campus oversight. Todd Dickey, you need to step down.  This is pure unadulterated sleeping on the job! Sickening.
Whenever you get 10 or more black young men together at a party – the likelihood of a shooting jumps astronomically. Call this offensive, paranoid, ignorant racist and whatever politically correct platitude you want – you just can’t argue with the facts. BTW – all the lily white liberals who would call me a racist would all rather their fair white daughters not attend these events and you hypocrites know it!
Also – why does USC/DPS always try to distance themselves from incidents like this as non-USC affiliated? YOU HAD PEOPLE GUNNED DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE USC CAMPUS!!!! Do you think stray bullets know if a person had USC ID or not? The fact DPS keeps emphasizing this tells me they are either hypocrites OR they are not well prepared for future incidents like this because they obviously do not think this is as big a safety breach because it just so happens no students, staff or employees were involved.
It is way past time for the Administration to begin to govern who comes onto campus. I am tired of seeing gangs of druken outsiders roaming through campus on their scateboards and bicycles. I am tired of seeing bums fight over who gets the contents of the garbage cans around campus, I am sick and tired of the campus trying to be everything to everybody, namely non-students, who live in the nighborhood. As parents, we pay a ton of money to USC to educate and to protect our children. It is an outrageous negligence to allow any tom dick and harry to come onto campus day or night. There has to be some sort of eyeballing of inappropriate people coming onto to campus.
This was a campus event for students–no one else should be there, period. Fix it Nikias or we will find someone who can.
A very disgruntled worried parent.
The student org organizing this event needs to take full responsibility for this and explain they didn’t  follow university policy
Halloween Party Promo
Watch This!

Why isn’t DPS and LAPD all
over the safe zone this morning to make my student feel safe? She didn’t see a single officer on her way to class!
It’s not about security. Anyone can go to any college campus with a gun and do something stupid. 
It’s about intolerably bad campus policy. Why in the world would USC allow a third party promoter to come to the heart of campus on HALLOWEEN night and host a party that is bound to attract this kind of crowd?
Start by firing the student affairs dean or executive who allowed this to happen.
totally agree! no amount of security could have prevented this. it was a failure in campus policy that created an unsafe environment for usc students.
USC campus events should be STRICTLY USC. End of story. its so irresponsible to be otherwise. The promoter of this party was advertising to anyone “even if you look suspect you just have to pay more”. how is this allowed??!!
. Three unrelated shooting incidents within 7 months is staggering–all of which involved students because they were present even when not the victims. The two murders last year were outside the so called safe zone but this was at the very heart of it. This is completely unacceptable. The university needs to focus its undivided attention on safety first as the rest is secondary. And this includes year round safety as the students are required by landlords to take yearlong leases not school year leases. People won’t send their kids here if USC doesn’t make it safe. We wont keep our children there if this isn’t stopped. Keep non students, staff and faculty off campus and out of any USC group sponsored events and increase the police presence in the safe zone dramatically. NOW
Don’t forget about the armed robbery on the Row last year a week or two after the double homicide.
I completely and totally agree.  This is both shocking and disgusting because the university is talking out of both sides of its mouth.  On the one hand, gosh we’re so wonderful and increasing our academic rise and we’re one of the world’s elite universities and blah blah blah and on the other hand, we have shootings, crime, and athletic scandals.
COME ON, USC.  Exactly how much are you charging each year now?  $60,000 a year?  Do you have any idea whatsoever how many middle class families don’t even consider your school now?
Give me a break.  Fix the stupid safety on campus already and have Haden clean up the athletic program.  Those of us who came to USC over other more highly ranked schools are sick and tired of having to defend our decisions.  See comments below about kids who chose USC over Ivies.
With all that extra tuition money coming in – from full-pay kids and federal loans – you’d figure the least that they could do was ensure a safe campus.
All Universities in the nation can’t stop non-students from coming onto the campus; if not because of USC safeties (individuals with no USC id are not allowing inside) the shooting would have happened inside the venue/tutor center building.  I understand how you feel, my daughter is a sophomore at USC, I was scared and worried when I heard about the shooting but I wasn’t upset at USC.  Like they said “These are individuals that unfortunately came here and decided to disrupt…” Just thank God that SC students were safe.
@Talysa:
Yes, anyone can go to any college campus with a gun and do something stupid.
But have you no concern about the terrible campus policy? Why in the world would USC allow a third party promoter to come to the heart of campus on HALLOWEEN night and host a party that is bound to attract this kind of crowd?
Start by firing the student affairs dean or executive who allowed this to happen.
And I am sure that we all knew how badly the surrounding area around USC but we still sent our kids there.  So we just have to believe the school and pray for our kids to be safe.
I’m never had a problem in my four years.  But I’m awesome.
This shows again kind of events that Program Board puts on. Events that as students we pay for but that in the end are attended by outsiders. Clearly the Geragos kid needs to fire the BSA person that was in charge and the PB director, Juan something.
You’re a dumbass
You’re ignorant and clearly have no idea or don’t read articles. This is the first time a student organization has had an issue like this so your comment on “This shows again the kind of events that program board puts on” has absolutely NO validity. Maybe you should look at the larger picture and turn your negative views on the campus security you are paying for rather than the people who sponsored the event and paid for security.
I don’t think he was referring to a lack of safety at PB events, but rather that students pay for PB events with the Activities fee in all of our tuitions, and these events are then in turn attended by large numbers of non-students for free or at reduced cost. This unfortunately poses a security risk as non-students in this part of LA are significantly more likely to instigate this kind of incident then a students are.
BSA HAD NO RELATION TO THIS EVENT. THE BSA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS DOING A PERFECTLY FINE JOB.
Why did the BSA scrub the website event calender?
Please Google “SC Hype” and watch Youtube video “LA Hype Presents SC Hype”  for a little idea of how a previous event on campus went.   Turn the sound down if you are easily offended because the lyrics are sick!
Completely appalled by the comment referring to the event as a “ghetto nightclub”!
USC is an open campus in the middle if LA – students do need to be reminded, constantly, to be aware of their surroundings. I was on campus during the LA Riots and the University did an excellent job securing the campus.
Punks with guns shooting each other in the middle of the campus should offend you a heckuva lot more than someone’s description.
Another shooting at USC, and the sun rises in the east.  Some things don’t change.
Meanwhile, commenters like you are “appalled” when race is mentioned, since the media omits it, going so far as to cover up the name of the “student organization”, as if we couldn’t figure it out.
Like it or not, violent crime is dramatically higher in cities with “majority minority” populations.  That’s not opinion, its DOJ statistics, which don’t change, year over year, except that they’re getting worse under the current administration   
You won’t solve the problem by pretending it doesn’t exist.
USC needs to fund for more campus security
And the protection of our students, faculty and staff. Due to its immense openness it’s hard to keep  people off campus who don’t belong- I used to walk through campus going to/from work – home. However , for all campus events SECURITY is obvious.
Having been a student, I know this IS the level of security on the campus. Student safety means nothing to the administrators, and they only act if they are forced to. It’s pretty telling when a statement issued by the president basicly says “This is ok because the victim and shooter weren’t USC students. It’s important you watch out for yourselves.” That’s been the attitude every time there is violence: everything is fine, and all students need to do to be safe is look around every so often. Sorry, but the continual robberies, rapes, and murders that occur here tell me otherwise. 
Administrators need to start making REAL efforts to protect the students, not just tell them they’re on their own. It’s not like the campus doesn’t have the money. Seriously, in the years I was on campus, the only thing DPS ever did was harrass students on bikes and direct traffic. Oh, and of course ride around on segways. It’s a matter of a very bad attitude and incredibly poor priorities.
Exactly right. 
Read the crime reports.  Do the math.  USC is the most dangerous campus I’ve ever been to. And the amount of security is barely enough to get the job done, and totally inadequate off campus. 
This is the second shooting this year.  Does that sound safe?
It makes no sense that USC would permit an outside promoter to sponsor a party like this on Halloween. Especially at the Tutor Center. If I were a member of Ronald Tutor’s family I would immediately demands that whoever allowed this to happen be fired. This is no different, and just as absurd, as USC tolerating raves taking place at the coliseum. And we all know where that ended up. 
USC administrators: the extra $$$ which you get from these events is not really needed and is not worth the loss of esteem and repute this university has spent the past decade winning year after year.
Why is a promoter inviting non USC people to a party in our campus center? What student organization partnered with the promoter? What needs to change so this doesn’t happen again? Because despite what the DPS spokesman Thomas said – this certainly DOES indicate a problem with the level of safety on campus – in the very heart of our campus! The students, staff and families deserve prompt answers to each of these questions, do they not?
I am shocked and disgusted on hearing this news. Everyone should have  USC ID upon entering the campus that is just common sense.
The party was “Freaks or Greeks”, sponsored by the Black Student Association … news organizations aren’t mentioning the group, but a google search on “Freaks and Greeks” will find the flyer
Okay, that’s one answer. Students, employees and parents still deserve to know why the Black Student Organization was allowed to partner with a promoter who basically turned our beautiful campus center into some sort of ghetto nightclub. And what guidelines for student groups need to change so that this never happens again?
“beautiful campus center”?  What do you think your campus is now Stanford and you are now in Palo Alto?  Get real.
Tutor Center is incredibly beautiful. Stanford doesn’t even really have a campus center.
Yes, the Ronald Tutor center is gorgeous.  And, yes, I have attended both universities.  Don’t be so naive, BostonCardinal.
“Ghetto nightclub?” Completely inappropriate and offensive. As a parent and alum, you should know better.
What do you call a nightclub where thugs with guns shoot each other?
Please Google “SC Hype” and watch the Youtube video of a previous event held on campus by this same group.   See if you are still offended.
This comment, referring to a “ghetto nightclub” is extremely offensive. It is clear that the term “ghetto” would not have been used had the event not been put on by a Black organization on campus. The racial bigotry in this comment reflects a greater problem of racial tension that is growing in the USC community. 
Comments like this make me ashamed to be a Trojan. Do better.
This comment reflects the greater problem of liberal stupidity, which makes ME ashamed to be a Trojan. Yes, “Alumni,” let’s get all wrapped up about someone accurately describing what happened – it was, in fact, the ghetto intruding onto the campus as other comments have also acknowledged. Let’s get all indignant about THAT and ignore the larger question which is why ANY student organization – the Chess Club, the Song Girls, and YES the Black Student Association – is allowed to host an event with a promoter that brings in outsiders to campus like this. Did you see the video that someone else posted, by the way? 
Focus on the problem at hand – how to avoid this type of safety threat to our students. Do better.
I don’t care that you feel ashamed. I do pretty well, too, so I don’t really feel like changing anything. And yeah—it was a ghetto event. Look at the video; in what civilized environment would something like that be permitted? I’m sorry the Black Student Assembly chose to do something like this—it only perpetuates and validates stereotypes that you are intent on ignoring.
And the band played on.

A shooting occurred during a Halloween party at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at approximately 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, authorities said.
Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Four victims were wounded and immediately transported to a local hospital, according to an official from the LAPD. One victim was in critical condition.
A suspect was taken into custody at 1:30 a.m. No victims were USC affiliated.
“We were waiting outside to get into the party and we were waiting for a while — maybe 20 or 30 minutes,” said Olivia Gordon, a freshman majoring in psychology. “And all of the sudden, as soon as people started going inside, there were multiple gunshots and everyone who was in line for the party ducked and we all ran.”
USC’s Dept. of Public Safety issued a Trojan Alert at 12:02 a.m. Thursday, asking students to take “shelter in place and avoid opening doors for unknown persons.”
Campus was later shut down.
“I heard three gun shots but I think it’s because — there might have been more than that but maybe because of all the people screaming made it so I couldn’t hear,” said Christina Nour, a freshman majoring in civil engineering building science. “Then I ducked. It didn’t feel real. It felt like it was a movie because I really haven’t experienced anything like this before. I was running as fast as I can trying to make sure I didn’t get trampled or tripped. I just ran as fast as I could, as far as I could. Then I met up with the friends I came with. It was just really crazy.”
Daniel Rothberg, Annalise Mantz and Yasmeen Serhan contributed to this report.

Quit lying BSA! Here is the proof!
http://neontommy.tumblr.com/post/34781709620/we-found-this-sign-in-the-ronald-tutor-campus
The top fraternities would never allow such a behavior? You’ve gotta be kidding me. They have sex in public and the drug/alcohol scene is way worse. You must not know what your son is truly around.
Sex in public+drug/alcohol scene = shootings?
Your math is suspect. I’d take public fornication and intoxication over shootings any day, and I challenge you to find a single person who would disagree with me.
Kappa Sig is not a top fraternity from what my son has told me.  So that whole story about the girl on the roof does not apply in my opinion.
It wasn’t a BSA party!! It was a party by an outside promoter who paired up with a few students to get the word out. NOT BSA. Parties like these have always been at campus center for the past few years without trouble and yes, they do involve the NPHC Greeks a majority of the time that’s why it was advertised as Freak or Greek. They’re held at the campus center because of safety, but some things are just not foreseen. You can try to pinpoint the blame on an org, but that doesn’t solve anything. What’re you gonna stop USC black students from congregating at BSA? Just pray for the victims involved and maybe look at the bigger issue, gun reform and community reform. We are in the hood….
You need to get your facts straight. The reports CLEARLY indicate that this was a BSA party. Stop spreading misinformation and trying to shift the blame.

“The shooting occurred around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where a long line of people were waiting to be checked into the party held by the Black Student Assembly.”
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/after-usc-shooting-music-played-party-continued.html
“USC officials said about 400 people were attending the “Freaks and Geeks” Halloween party, which was sponsored by the Black Student Assembly.” (this article also notes that the party continued for hours after the shooting, which is disgustingly irresponsible on the BSA and the promoter’s part)
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/wounding-shooting-usc-campus-17614581#.UJK-FWl24gc
“…the party held by the Black Student Assembly.”
Why don’t you just come out and blame Obama for all this?
Twat,
You seem to be more concerned that the shooter not be disparaged because he is black then the fact he GUNNED DOWN 4 PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF USC LAST NIGHT!!!! This is the priority in plain view we get from a generation poisoned with political correctness!
Rat,
You don’t know who is black and who isn’t.  You be sure and tell everybody about your suburban “black” friends that you hung with back in the day.  You are nothing but a racist bigot f-cracker!
uh, Twan, the shooter was black…there are pictures of the arrest all over twitter. And calling someone “cracker” kind of kills your credibility when it comes to calling people racist.
Why did the BSA scrub all their internet content of the event.   What are you hiding?
Much like Benghazi and Obama, soon we will know everything and people are going to pay!
Just to be clear, there are at least two “Gabriels” commenting.
Please ignore the other Gabriels!  There are at least two fakes and two real ones
Then why did BSA take it off their events page and why does it come up under BSA when “Freak or Greek” is typed on Google?
Are you a bigot?  Everyone knows Google is racist!
@Twan
USC Officials told LA Times BSA sponsored “Freaks or Greeks” event,
“University officials said that the party was sponsored by the Black Student Assembly and attended by about 400 people. None of those involved in the shooting were students at USC.
A flier for the “Freak or Geek” party notes that it was produced by “SC Hype.” It was dubbed “The Biggest Halloween Costume Party.””
That makes the scrubbing of the BSA website an apparent attempt to cover their tracks.
Google is not racist!
Another video you need to watch about this promoter’s previous event!  The guy behind the bar clearly has a gun in his pants!
youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
You all are getting besides the point, which is in fact that there were victims who were hurt and we should be concerned about their safe recovery.
If you want to call the party put on in the campus center a ghetto nightclub okay whatever but I must add that I could find some equally if not worse things to say about the hidden activity that occurs on the row and other campus parties.
There have been many successful parties put on by this organizer at the campus center. The purpose of having it at the campus center was to provide a safe place on campus where students could enjoy themselves. The promoters and student organizers had no way of knowing that someone would come on to campus and disturb the peace.
They took precautions by having police and security there at the event.
Let’s not racialize this event. There were non-African-Americans there as well. Look at the reports so far it hasn’t been only what you would call “ghetto” locals at the party. There were students from many races and backgrounds present.
There are many non-students who come to USC parties. Whether it be on campus, on the row, or at someone’s dorm it is not a relatively new issue.
I, as, a student just want to pray for the victims and their families. I now they are not USC students and you all could care less but I know there are people out there hurting. 
I think it is within the best interest in our community that we figure out better preventive methods instead of figure-pointing and speculating about the event’s content.
Is this your previous successful event?
youtube.com/watch?v=QiMMRQKR0Yg
I am horrified at what this video depicts.   Last night my son was ministering to his fraternity brothers on the Row the word of God without alcohol and without licentious women.  How dare anyone associate this on campus event with the SC Greek system.
Is this was an SC event this is despicable.
Yes, same room as last nights event.
Something is truly wrong at SC and it has nothing to do with the Row.  The top fraternities would never allow such behavior!
It’s hard not to racialize it when the only reason this happened is that the BSA promoted the party to a ton of locals. If this had been at a frat house, or if locals hadn’t been invited, this would not have happened. 
Want a better preventive method? Stop letting the BSA throw parties on campus, and stop letting locals anywhere near campus. There, problem solved. People don’t get shot at frat parties. People get shot when locals show up.
Oh, I see, “Show me papers dark skinned fellow who doesn’t play sports”
Another Bigot checking in!
Sorry but was is the BSA?
Yes. http://www.timesunion.com/news/crime/article/4-wounded-at-USC-campus-shooting-in-Los-Angeles-3999369.php
The LA Times also reported that it was a BSA party.
Twan, it’s not bigotry, it’s just an honest observation.
Read the news: the promoters and student organizers BILLED this as a public event.
I thnk many people are getting off base in regards to the whole greek thing and what this has to do with it. I am a freshman who is not in a sorority but has many friends who are.  There are parties all the time off campus and the issue and problem is that USC should not be hosting these types of events with non students. My daughter lives on campus and its unsettling that so many people came to campus last night. There are plenty of things to do in LA and parties on the Row, we do not need any more. Dont blame greek life becuse people will party regardless. I do think that if our school wanted to minimize the partying on the row, it could be done. My daughter doesnt really drink at all and has told me some reallly interesting stories…
This had NOTHING to do with Greek life. This was a BLACK STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party. The Row had nothing to do with it. The DT should be reporting who was behind the party so that people don’t get the wrong idea and blame the Greek system.
For once, I actually agree with you.
USC has an obligation to be an open campus and host some community events.  
It is the price they pay for being an International institution and for absorbing city property & community real estate.
Campus police can only do so much.  Some shootings are unpreventable.
I would suggest a stronger vetting process for groups that want to have events on campus.
An obligation? It’s a private institution on private property. You must be high.
You are being silly.
USC receives millions of dollars each year from the Federal government (aka taxpayer dollars) and in private donations.  
No serious institution will want to touch USC if USC decides to become a country club or gated community for middle-class White students … which seems to be what you and some other posters want.
I’m not advocating for some gated “country club” university. I recognize that USC is a diverse school (most international in the country, in fact). And I don’t normally have a problem with non-students on our property. As long as they respect the students, the property, and their surroundings, I couldn’t care less what they do.
I’m in disagreement with your notion that the surrounding community can just feel entitled to come onto our campus, given that the university has some sort of “requirement.” Unless there is a true reason (academic, in most cases), non-students have no business to just hang out on our campus. It’s private property governed by a private institution that receives a lot of “membership dollars” (aka tuition) for the “members” (students) to attend. Thus, USC’s property, USC’s rules. The requirement USC has is to protect its institution and those that pay for it. I suppose that because you get tax breaks from our “lovely” government, I can just hang out on your property whenever I want, right? Think of any private business or venue; in their world, it’s trespassing. Why shouldn’t that apply here?
And let’s be clear: USC receives far too much money from private donors to just allow unnecessary risk, especially to property, or more importantly, lives. What “serious institutions” are you referring to that wouldn’t support that?
It is a private school, surrounded by a much larger community in which they have purchased
property , housing, & shopping centers. The campus itself may be private but, the rest is apart
of the surrounding community.
Agree to disagree, mostly. The property USC owns can be privately enforced on a case by case basis. Sure, the UV and other outdoor areas may be public, but under no circumstances should a non-USC individual be allowed into USC Housing unless they are a documented guest. It all depends on what you mean by “apart [sic] of the surrounding community.” Physically, yes. When it comes to authorization, it depends – mostly, any property owned by USC that they designate as private gives non-USC people absolutely no right to enter.
An obligation to allow thugs on campus? I think not. If you look like a local, DPS should be stopping and frisking you every time they see you on campus. They need to keep the rest of us safe.
And what does a local look like? How do you propose DPS decide who to stop and frisk? I’m not sure whether I look like a local or not, but I guarantee if DPS began profiling (because that’s what you’re suggesting) they’d have a whole different problem on their hands.
USC’s academic rise has been extraordinary. It has attracted many students who could have chosen Ivys. There seems to be a lag in the elevation of the social atmosphere or at least appreciation of the urban location, national reputation as a party scene the Row has created (Playboy # 2 rated party school 2012), impact of USC allowed raves (see Google LA Hype present SC hype for an uncensored video or visit the Row at 1 a.m. on another weekend than Parents weekend) on the not so extraordinary social climate created at USC. The academic and social climate are out of sync. Only one will prevail and I would like it to be USC as a top university.
Other top universities in urban environments do not seem to have USC’s violence and seemingly well-earned party school reputation…Columbia in Spanish Harlem/ Yale in New Haven. Perhaps we can all learn from them. What social atmosphere have their admins encouraged that we might encourage at USC. Their students seemed socially fulfilled and their academic standing cemented as top universities in diverse urban environments.
You are so full of it Gabe.   That and you are broken record Greek hating bigot!
That’s telling her Ryan. HA!
This isn’t about the social climate on the row. This was a BSA party, not a row party. Completely different crowd, hence completely different results. No one gets shot at frat parties.
We have a freshman daughter at USC. We are from MN. We had several people tell us how bad the area was & that they would never send their kid to USC. I kept saying how impressed I was with security. Obviously there are now concerns!! Something didn’t work & needs to be changed. Why are non students allowed on campus? It’s a private school. Gates surround campus- Use them!!!  Buy up more property surrounding campus and rebuild.  We need answers and solutions on this one!!!
What is sad is yhay with all that money USC has
Thanks to all that tuition that is paid, does not have more campus security present during events
It should be common sense.
Please no more non USC guests at parties.
My son is a freshman at USC, and our family was there last weekend for USC Family Weekend.  During our visit, I was impressed by the caliber of students we met. This is not an out of control party school with excess drugs, alcohol and sexual behavior.  We went to a fraternity tailgate party, and the kids were respectful and having fun without sex, drugs or alcohol.  I went to a large private east coast university with an incredible party scene in the 1980’s, so I understand that scene–USC is NOT like that.
I also have a freshman and was there for family weekend. Not to take away from what you said, but I know a lot of the normal parties were not in full swing during that weekend. Although USC is a fine school with amazing students, the partying is very much a part of the social life off campus. That is why I am so upset that our school would allow so many non-students to come to a party on the campus.
Stefanie, I sure that what you saw was especially for that weekend, I, like you also attended college and grad school in the 1980’s, and when parents were on campus, of course we were on our best behaviour (come on now) you know how it goes.
On Campus.. How scary!  Thanks for the article, DT.  Gabriel, you’re an imbecile.  ~CNTVAlum ’90
I just saw Toni guinyard interview someone in charge of DPS on NBC News. I was disappointed in his mannerism and comments.  I felt he was shrugging off the incident….making comments like I hope the students didn’t party too hard last night and are ready for classes today.  This is serious business. They need to do something about the security on campus. If you are not a student at USC you have nobusiness at a campus party.
Diversity:  Are we having fun yet?
this was a CAMPUS EVENT
Gabriel, you need to get your facts straight. There were no USC students, faculty, or staff involved. We may have this incident but USC still has high security and has done a lot to keep the campus safe even compared to ivy league campuses. Here’s an article you should read: http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2012/06/18/america-s-25-most-crime-rattled-colleges-from-yale-to-duke-photos.html#slide. Realize that usc is not listed, yet you see yale and duke up in the crime-zone rankings.
1. Neon Tommy referenced the party as “Freak or Greek 
2. The large Greek parties with alcohol, drug and sexual excesses mark USC as a party haven and attract so inclined. Ask Playboy about it. There are few, if any, other more sophisticated social options at USC so the reputation is solidified.
This was not a Greek party. It was a BSA party. The Greek system had nothing to do with it. That’s why there was such a large crowd of locals. They advertised it as the biggest costume party in LA, open to all, and the promoter had the gall to continue promoting it on Twitter for two hours after the shootings.
Don’t blame the Greek system, it had nothing to do with this travesty. It had everything to do with the BSA inviting locals on campus.
I’m not quite sure what greek life has to do with it…After all, this was a party on campus at the Tutor Center. No faculty, staff, or students were involved. This was somebody going on campus with a gun and firing- a matter of poor security evidenced by the fact that it took 3 hours to find the bastard.
USC admins need to decide if USC is a near future leading university or a frat rat party school. It just is not working to be both. The decision will be made for USC if admin does not act. Top students and their parents will not choose or remain in an urban L.A. scholl where large Greek parties, alcohol, drugs and smokin dj’s appear regularly along with violence and superficial social and sexual behavior. It would seem creating a more sophisticated social atmosphere in keeping with the vision for the school is desirable, but a focus in that direction is not happening. So admins, what is USC’s future, stellar academic university or urban party school?
Gabriel- your comments are completely out of line. The shooting occurred on campus at the new Tudor Student Center. It was NOT a Greek frat party with “alcohol, drugs and smoking djs”. The LA TImes reported that the suspect now in custody is not even a USC student and that the shooting was related to a dispute between one of the victims and the gunman.What is scary is that someone with a loaded weapon could wander onto the campus where police were present and  open fire on innocent students right across from Tommy Trojan.
OMG observer, thank you!!!  I was wondering when some1 was going to respond to her.  Her comments were so “all over the place” that I just didn’t bother.
Gabriel, you seem to have an agenda against USC. Why else would you inject Greek system into a university sanctioned non-Greek event?
Thanks Asim, for asking that question.  I wondered that exact same thing.  Yeah Gabriel, what is your deal/agenda with USC?
Gabriel,
Your comments are idiotic and misguided.  You are using this incident to vent your jealous hatred of an outstanding university.
I co-sign this comment.  I totally agree.
Not even Greek here, but Gabriel, let me help you save time. Since you’re such a Greek hater, just make one stock comment about how much you hate the system and use it on every article, since that seems to be your intent everywhere anyway.
Not that bright.  Must not be a USC graduate.
[…] Following the shooting, the campus went on lockdown for a short time and students and faculty were sent a Trojan Alert asking them to ‘seek shelter in place and avoid opening doors for unknown persons,’ according to the campus newspaper the Daily Trojan. […]
