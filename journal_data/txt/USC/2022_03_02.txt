In celebration of Women’s History Month, the USC Office of Cultural Relations and University Events hosted an online panel of USC-affiliated speakers and performers Tuesday. The event opened with Megan van der Toorn, student equity and inclusion programs manager of signature programs, commemorating the Tongva people, an Indigenous group that resided for thousands of years on what is now USC’s campus.
President Carol Folt, who opened the celebration, noted that “unlike most universities in America, USC was co-ed, diverse and international from its start in the late 1880s” and introduced the event’s theme: “Providing Healing, Promoting Hope.”
“There are healthcare workers, first responders, caregivers and service industry workers, and they’ve been working tirelessly since the beginning to offer healing and restore hope,” Folt said. “Today, we’re all thinking about all the tireless workers and women and children and families in Ukraine who are fighting so valiantly for their own freedom.”
Speaking on her first day as Dean of the Keck School of Medicine, Dr. Carolyn Meltzer took time to reflect on “the greatest joy in [her] own career” -— being a mentor for young women students.
“I recall bursting with pride when my first medical student mentee gave a talk at a national conference and again years later when she was honored as a distinguished physician scientist,” Meltzer said. “I look forward to meeting so many of you and to partnering to continue to accelerate our pace on this journey toward equity and excellence for women.”
Moderator Darby Saxbe, associate professor of psychology and co-director of the USC Center for the Changing Family, said the theme of the event “highlights and honors the critical work of women around the globe as caregivers and community healers,” but expressed her concern that the theme “may also lead into some gendered stereotypes of women being expected to be care providers.”
“We saw real collapse during the pandemic of some of the structures — daycares, schools, elder care facilities — that … support caregiving needs. And women took on a default burden of caregiving, and their workforce participation dropped as a result down to levels that we haven’t seen since the 1980s,” Saxbe said. 
Dr. Natasha Sanchez Cristal, panelist and a fourth year resident of the LAC+USC emergency medicine program, said the pandemic “felt as if the world was on fire and we were standing there with mere buckets of water trying to survive.”
“Those are the stories that I now see when I reflect upon the pandemic. It’s the faces of so many women in our community who, despite their minimum wage salaries, were asked to risk exposure and work outside their homes as essential workers,” Cristal said. “[I see] the faces of the many who reassured their families and fought against all odds with such ferocious strength and faith.”
Panelist Dr. Parveen Parmar, an emergency physician and the director of the Center for Gender Equity in Medicine and Science at the Keck School of Medicine, noted that emergency providers witnessed firsthand the struggles their communities faced. Parmar commended caregivers that had to balance their personal lives, their families and their jobs.
Parmar not only spoke on the heightened responsibilities of emergency medicine workers during the pandemic but also the need to support female caregivers during this time.
“It would be ideal someday to be able to find ways for women to be able to thrive in their caregiving roles and at work and really share the burden in much more equitable ways,” Parmar said. “That’s something that we’re all working towards.”
LaToya Council, a panelist and a doctoral candidate studying sociology and gender studies, said Women’s History Month should be an opportunity to talk about the intersection of justice and health equity.
“In that sense, we think about communities of color, particularly Black communities,” Council said. “I’m thinking about Black women and the work that I do in my research, how community care and caregiving have been a response to large insistence of inequality, namely the race and gender oppression by the state, and how we have to combat those things.”
Parmar said Women’s History Month should also discuss the role of men in caregiving professions, adding that creating a more equitable society requires uplifting men “who support those goals,” and urged participants to begin breaking down the gender norms that “make caregiving a more female trait.” 
Jessica Minsol Kim, panelist, senior majoring in environmental engineering and chief programming officer for the Undergraduate Student Government, iterated the central role that STEM jobs have in bridging gendered income disparities. Kim said her parents and teachers’ advocacy for women in STEM uplifted her ability to find economic independence outside of marriage.
Rachel Freeman-Cohen, panelist and a graduate student studying postsecondary administration and student affairs, talked about her personal experiences serving on the diversity and inclusion committee at UC Santa Cruz. Freeman-Cohen spoke of the “dismissiveness” she felt from committee members. 
“I am reminded of how often people in my community who share similar intersections of identity are treated in academia,” said Freeman-Cohen in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I do constantly wonder how it would look different after I walk across that stage and when I have the credentials … Will I be treated the same … Or will my degree speak for itself?”
Kim noted how women leaders in her life have shaped her ideals about leadership, and she encouraged participants to advocate for equity “in all aspects of life”.
“In personal experience … some of the leaders that I really looked up to were all women because they’re so nurturing, because they’re so empathetic and because they’re able to bring groups out of difficulties with such confidence and honesty,” Kim said. “This is a great time for us to think about how these traits make us great leaders too.”

Hannah Woodworth and Nivea Krishnan were elected as the next president and vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government, the USG elections commission announced during Tuesday’s senate meeting. USC Campus Activities will finalize the election results March 8. 
Woodworth, a junior who currently serves as the executive aide to president Alexis Areias, and Krishnan, a sophomore who currently is a senator, defeated two write-in tickets — neither of which were included on the official ballot. Write-in candidates included the ticket of Rachel Lee and Collin Colson and the ticket of Kyle Valdes and Safal Mengi. 
The total voter turnout was 4,451, with 3,749 voting for candidates and 702 abstaining from voting in the presidential election. Hannah-Nivea garnered 55.11% of the vote, with a total of 2,453 votes. Lee-Colson received 18.62% of the vote, with a total of 823 votes, while Kyle-Safal received 10.62% of the vote, with a total of 473 votes. 
“I’m excited to take over the position of vice president,” Krishnan said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I have big shoes to fill from Lucy [Warren] because she’s done a lot of great work, so I definitely want to make sure I carry through that work but excited to make some big changes to make our student government more accessible and more transparent.”
Woodworth and Krishnan ran on a platform of “accountability, advocacy and accessibility.” Their goals for the upcoming academic year include creating greater transparency between USG and the student body through public engagement sessions, building on current advocacy related to expanding the free Lyft program and establishing an annual accessibility audit. 
“I’m definitely very happy with the presidential results,” senator Brian Stowe said. “I think [Krishnan] will do an excellent job, and [Woodworth] is extremely smart as well; so, definitely looking forward to seeing what will happen next year in USG with both of them in charge.”
Former presidential candidates Weston Bell-Geddes and Erica Wang dropped out of the race on Feb. 3, writing on Instagram that “seeking positions within USG is not the way to achieve our goals.” Bell-Geddes and Wang later endorsed the write-in presidential candidates in a post on their Instagram. 
The election season marked a return to in-person campaigning after two years largely online, with candidates passing out food, speaking on megaphones and putting up yard signs around campus. Woodworth and Krishnan received endorsements from Phi Alpha Delta, Trojan Democrats, Alpha Phi Omega, Model United Nations of Southern California, AcceptED USC and BusinessSC.
“I would just say that it was a hard-fought campaign,” chief communications officer Jacob Wheeler said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Every candidate put in their best effort … Anyone who promotes democracy and wants to fulfill democracy should be admired and should be commended, so I commend all the candidates.”
The 2022-23 USG senators will be Devin Ayala, Navya Singh, Michelle Lu, Yoav Gillath, Divya Jakatdar, Maria Barun, Aidan Feighery, Sanjana Sambhwani, Jessica Gonzalez, Alvaro Flores, Sam Habibi and Victor Ye. 
Woodworth, Krishnan and the senators will be inaugurated April 5.
Prior to the announced election results, vice president Lucy Warren presented updates on inclusion, accessibility and misconduct reporting projects. 
Warren’s inclusion projects include implementing UndocuAlly Training — an initiative to educate staff and faculty on better understanding undocumented students — and Pronouns Pledge, a initiative to incorporate into the LGBTQ+ faculty training to create space for pronouns to be shared in the classroom, which will be solidified for the upcoming fall semester. Warren’s final inclusion project will include diversity, equity and inclusion questions on course evaluations to ensure that professors are held accountable in the classroom climate. 
With accessibility, Warren is working on getting an “embedded”  counselor for students with disabilities, an accessibility scavenger hunt which will be held in the first week of April to spread awareness about campus accessibility, providing virtual class accommodations advocating for the disability cultural center, and expanding the Office of Student Accessibility Services. 
Warren is also working with the USC Student Equity and Inclusion Programs on creating an Bias Incident Team, which will provide a centralized recording form for students to report misconduct.
Senator Hana Li then presented her updates related to allocating increased funding and resources for the Transfer Student Assembly, creating a communications campaign detailing Title IX and RSVP processes to report  and working with Leda Health to speak with a trained crisis counselor 24/7. 
Li announced their plans to draft a resolution in support of the Ukrainian community. The Global Politics Institute will be hosting an event Crisis Briefing: The Russian Invasion of Ukraine Thursday at 12:30 p.m. 
Areias confirmed the nomination Bradley Furgerson as wellness chair and Wheeler as chief communications officer, the latter of who addressed concerns about an Instagram Live comment from USG’s official account during the Feb. 18 presidential debate. Wheeler also said he looks to plan a “COVID-19 town hall” for students to voice their concerns as USC considers its next steps on health restrictions. 
“I’m excited. I am working alongside dedicated, talented, brilliant people in USG,” Wheeler said.

Around 20 students, faculty and staff gathered for a vigil Tuesday in solidarity with Ukraine, holding candles, giving speeches, delivering prayers and leading meditations. The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures hosted the event at the University Religious Center courtyard.
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion against Ukraine last Thursday after months of military buildup on the Ukrainian border. At the time of publication, around 660,000 Ukrainians fled the country in the last week as missiles targeted major cities, according to United Nations Refugee Agency. The Russian army inflicted casualties in the hundreds, and Putin has put the Russian nuclear force on alert.
President Carol Folt spoke first, emphasizing the need for a “more peaceful resolution.”
“There are millions and millions of people around the world, just horrified by what we’re seeing,” Folt said. “I know that we all are sharing connection: inter-faith connection, inter-community connection, inter-country connection. This is such a human moment.”
The Organization for Students of Slavic and East European Studies at USC, members of whom were present at the vigil, wrote in a statement that it was “stunned at the unprovoked and tyrannical entry of Russian forces into Ukraine,” and that the “Ukrainian people have every right to defend themselves and their land.”
“Does the constant potential of violence remain the only way to keep further violence at bay?” the statement read. “If so, let it remain at potential. We ask for diplomacy and open communication between nations and, first and foremost, an end to violence and bloodshed.”
Valerie Katritch, a freshman majoring in environmental science and health, spoke next about her Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish identities and the questions she received about how she felt “about the current situation.”
“Why should my identity affect my opinion on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine?” Katritch said. “Whose side I’m on does not matter. I am against war.” 
Katritch then read text messages a Russian soldier had sent to his mother before his death, which were initially relayed by Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations.
“Mama, I’m in Ukraine,” the messages read. “There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us. And they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves onto the wheels and not allowing us to pass.”
Katritch said she, too, was afraid of “what our world has become.”
“We often want to put one side as the bad guy and one as the good guy; it’s simpler that way,” Katritch said. “But, in reality, there is one common enemy we’re against here: the Putin administration and the notion of war in general.” 
Following Katritch, students and faculty led a series of prayers. Simardeep Gawra, a junior majoring in computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering, recited the Ardas, a set prayer in Sikhism.
The closing speaker said the war in Ukraine was an “assault against democracy,” and called on attendees to “have the courage of the Ukrainian people to stand up for democracy in this society.”
“The only threat that Ukraine poses to Vladimir Putin is the example of the Ukrainian people embracing democracy,” another speaker said. “A threat to democracy anywhere is a threat to democracy everywhere.”
The vigil ended as attendees stood gathered in a circle and shared a silent moment of reflection.

USC’s momentum was stifled right from the tip-off Tuesday night. 
Following the narrow victory over Oregon Saturday evening, cemented by senior guard Drew Peterson’s three-pointer in the dying seconds, men’s basketball fell 91-71 to No. 2 Arizona in their return to Galen Center. Tuesday’s bout saw the Wildcats jump out early, pushing the pace of play and blowing the Trojans out in their own gym. USC now sits at 25-5 on the season and is eliminated from contention to win the Pac-12 regular season title. 
The Trojans’ prolific scorers throughout the season, Peterson, junior guard Boogie Ellis and junior forward Isaiah Mobley, contributed underwhelming offensive performances as the trio combined for just 28 points on 8 of 34 shooting from the field. 
“Our best players have to play well in big games, and they have done that for most of the season,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in a post-game press conference. “They all had off-nights … It was frustrating. I know our players are frustrated because they didn’t have their best games.” 
Peterson suffered woes in the shooting column against the Wildcats, managing 2 for 11 field goal attempts and missing all 6 3-pointer attempts. 
“I just got to keep the confidence going and let my teammates trust me,” said Peterson in a post-game press conference. “I’m not going to lose any confidence from a shooting night like this.” 
The Trojans fell to a 21-8 deficit within the first eight minutes of the opening half as the Wildcats came out of the gate with 3 3-pointers on their first 4 attempts. Despite multiple attempts at a comeback during the opening half, such as the 7-0 mid-first-half run catalyzed by junior forward Max Agbonkpolo, the Trojans just couldn’t turn things around. 
Arizona sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin’s 19 points, 5 assists, 6 rebounds and 3 steals on 7 of 13 shooting from beyond the arc and 3 of 6 efficiency on 3-point attempts fueled the Wildcats’ 51-point first half. 
The Wildcats maintained their insurmountable lead throughout the second half as they continued their hot shooting from the 3-point line. Arizona converted 5 3-pointers on 8 attempts, whereas USC only converted 3 of 10 attempts in the second half. 
Despite a late rally call from the Trojans in the last few minutes of the second half, where the Trojans trimmed the score to a 80-64 margin, Arizona’s defense remained adamant and held on to its lead as the game concluded. 
The Trojans managed a measly 22.2% shooting from beyond the arc, missing out on open looks from range and subsequently giving up fast-break points, of which the Wildcats had 13.
“The disappointing thing is, when you have a crowd like that, you don’t want to lose by 20 [points],” Enfield said. “That’s the disappointing thing for me as a head coach … Whatever we did or didn’t do, that’s on me.” 
The Trojans finish their season with a road matchup against UCLA Saturday, March 5 at Pauley Pavilion.

USC finished the regular season with a 12-15 record, good for 10th in the Pac-12 standings. The Trojans now look ahead to the Pac-12 Tournament, where they will play No. 7 seed UCLA for the third time this season.
“One of the greatest privileges in working in collegiate athletics is being part of the excitement of March,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a press conference Tuesday. “We’re trying to channel some really positive energy and momentum into a tough opening-round game against UCLA that we’re super excited for.”
USC lost both matchups against UCLA in the regular season, with the first being a 66-43 loss on the road. The Trojans shot just 28% from the field and 12% from three on 27 turnovers. UCLA had a balanced attack, with three players in double figures led by graduate student forward llmar’l Thomas with 20 points.
In their second matchup against the Bruins, the Trojans lost at home 68-58. Junior guard Charisma Osborne scored a season-high 27 points to lead the way for the Bruins along with 14 points and 7 assists from Thomas.
Osborne will command attention from USC’s defense. The junior leads UCLA in three statistical categories — averaging 17.1 points, 3.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game. 
USC came off of a road trip that garnered mixed results last weekend, splitting their final two games against Arizona State and Arizona. USC defeated the Sun Devils 60-58 after junior guard Alyson Miura hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the corner. 
“She’s obviously an incredibly sharp shooter,” Gottlieb said. “She has a quick release, and she’s really picked her spots. She’s got the confidence to let it fly when she’s open.”
Against Arizona, the Trojans fell short, losing 68-59. Freshman guard Rayah Marshall led the Trojans in scoring with 18 points and tallied 7 blocks on the defensive end. 
Sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins, USC’s leading scorer throughout the season, is set to return for the game against UCLA after missing the Arizona road trip with a concussion. 
Turnovers were an issue for USC in both games over the weekend as the Trojans committed 35 turnovers in two games compared to the 15 combined turnovers from Arizona State and Arizona. Gottlieb said that cutting down on unforced errors will be crucial as the team prepares for the Bruins Wednesday.
“The best transition defense is taking care of the ball. It’s hard to defend in transition when you’re throwing it to the other team,” Gottlieb said. “It’s something that’s just been a point of emphasis.”
The third installment of the crosstown rivalry will take place Wednesday at 6 p.m. at Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas.

What’s in a name? 
Among all the gifts our parents give us when we are born, our name is perhaps the most unique. In it lies our identity, who we are and where we come from. Our last names are witnesses to and bearers of our ancestry. If a woman gets married to a man, it is a custom that her last name changes from that of her father to that of her husband — a change in her name signals a change in her life.
First names, on the other hand, are usually chosen for aesthetic appeal or with special blessings from the family like popular “American” such as Matthew, Noah, Mary or Ruth. 
As a Chinese American, I was given the first name “Yunxi” at birth. It is composed of two separate Chinese characters, “Yun” and “Xi,” each symbolizing beautiful rhythm and flow and my cultural roots in Xi’an, where my family comes from. As early as kindergarten, however, I experienced the embarrassment and shame for my “foreign” name — a feeling that would accompany me for years to come as I still struggle with my cultural identity. 
I somehow internalized others’ difficulty in pronouncing or remembering my name as my own fault. Four-year-old me finally couldn’t deal with the social pressure that came from having a different name and asked my parents to give me “an American name.” They translated the first character of my name “Yun” into English, which became Melody, a name I have since used. 
The second character of my name, which signified my cultural roots and connected me to my grandparents and great-grandparents, could not get carried over into English. Like the literal erasure of my cultural heritage as I anglicized my name, the Asian part of me slowly eroded away as I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood. 
The painful dilemma which I found myself was aspiring to assimilate or to vanish, which is the precarious position that continues to be faced by many Asian Americans today, who have long dealt with the perpetual foreigner stereotype. 
My attitude of spurning my Asian name is not an uncommon one among Asian Americans. When I was ashamed of my Chinese name, I never corrected how English speakers pronounced my last name. I even felt jealous of my Asian peers who had last names that already exist as English words as they are easier for English speakers to pronounce, such as Lee, Fan and Sun. Gradually, like many Asian Americans, I began introducing myself in my anglicized last name — I voluntarily erased a part of my identity.
Many Asian immigrants are assigned English names by their American teachers in English as a Second Language programs. It is a very common, yet underresearched, experience. This is especially common among international Asian students who were not given English names by their parents. 
A friend from mainland China told me she got her English name, “Bella,” from the main protagonist in the “Twilight” series. Bella’s experience is far more common than you would think. In assimilating, many Asians are quite literally renamed and given a new identity. Is that the price we must pay for being American? When are we American enough? When do we need to stop proving our Americanness? 
As I turned away from my Asian name and identity, I grappled with a myriad of complex and ambiguous emotions including shame, perplexity, resistance and denial, before I finally came to understand it as evidence of my internalized racism. For Asian Americans, the name struggle attests to the broader experience of struggling with belongingness in one’s own skin.
As the coronavirus pandemic revealed the violence and discrimination against Asians in this country, and as newer generations of Asian Americans begin to challenge common Asian stereotypes and combat the long history of racism against Asian Americans, we begin to see a growing number of Asians who refuse to change their name to meet the needs of white culture. 
In 2020, Vietnamese student Phuc Bui Diem Nguyen at Laney College in Oakland, Calif., was requested by her professor to anglicize her name because her name reminded him of an insult in English. Nguyen refused and defended her given birth name, and the professor was soon suspended for his racist and xenophobic remark. 
After almost two decades of hiding my Chinese name, I am finally reclaiming it, beginning the path of reconnecting with my Chinese culture. We cannot stop the invisibility and discrimination we experience by erasing our Asianness and adopting whiteness. So learn to say my name. Learn to say our names.

Last week, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing — undercut by a fair amount of controversy, faltering athletes, the United States’ diplomatic boycott on China and a doping scandal — concluded. At the center of its controversy, 15-year-old Russian figure skating prodigy Kamila Valieva tested positive for a banned substance at a competition in December. The International Olympics Committee still allowed her to compete, but she finished a surprising fourth. 
These events, along with the recent Super Bowl, delineate a rather cynical pedagogy: No matter what we do, whether it involves transgender athletes or liking Taylor Swift as much as men like football, we can only do wrong. 
In Beijing, news surfaced of Valieva’s positive test for the banned, endurance-increasing heart medication, trimetazidine, from the sample she submitted after the Russian National Championship on Dec. 25. Considered a “protected athlete” under the World Anti-Doping Agency, Valieva still competed in the individual women’s figure skating competition. 
In her hearings, Valieva and her representatives claimed she may have accidentally ingested her grandfather’s heart medication, but according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart, its high concentration was “clearly not trace amounts.” Additionally, she takes two other heart medications — L-carnitine and Hypoxen — which further suggests the three medications were intended to enhance her sports performance instead of treating her heart “variations,” as her mother stated.
This is not to say that Valieva is to blame for the doping as it was her coaches and parents who were supposed to protect her. Of course, her coach’s nickname is “Cruella de Vil” because she is notorious for her harsh and, well, cruel training methods.  
It might be even more infuriating that the Court of Arbitration for Sport cited “irreparable harm” from not competing as a reason to allow Valieva to still skate. Indeed, Sha’Carri Richardson wanted a word. Last summer, Richardson earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, and then she tested positive for THC, a non-performance-enhancing banned substance. She took to Twitter to denounce the IOC, writing, “The only difference I see is I’m a black young lady.”
Again, we see an all-too-familiar double standard: A Black woman tests positive for marijuana and gets held to a higher standard than the white people with a history of systemic doping. Destroying the Black person’s career is justice, but destroying the white person’s career could cause “irreparable damage” — sound familiar? 
Amid the doping controversy at the Olympics, we can see another victim besides the athletes competing against Valieva: transgender athletes, specifically transgender women. The transgender athlete controversy seems evergreen at this point. Earlier this month, however, Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania, occupied right-leaning news outlets’ reporting after 16 of her teammates published an anonymous letter criticizing her “unfair advantage.”  
Transgender women are all-too-often the scapegoat for reconciling our twisted social constructions. We apparently cannot allow transgender women to use the women’s bathroom because men could weaponize it as an excuse to enter women’s bathrooms. According to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, gender-affirming care for transgender youth is “child abuse.”
Last I checked, men will commit sexual assault whether or not transgender women can use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. Transphobia and denying essential care to transgender youth is child abuse. 
We also apparently cannot allow transgender women athletes to compete against cis women because they take away opportunities from “real” women in a society that dichotomizes gender and sex, leaving those who do not fit the binary in the margins. 
Interestingly enough, no one has a problem with superhuman cis athletes such as Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps, who also take away opportunities to break records and win from their fellow competitors when they earn gold medals and break world records. Phelps himself, ironically, has condemned transgender women competing in sports. 
Phelps’ comments epitomize the men responsible for these double standards within women’s sports. Transphobia and policing women’s bodies — while its perpetuity is not exclusive to just men — stem from patriarchal standards that confine women to a submissive societal place and negatively react when someone traverses said place. Simone Biles’ backlash for prioritizing her mental health came from co-opting the toxic masculinity that encourages recklessness and violence over safety. 
This heteronormative principle coexists with misogyny. It is why men can act like badgers fighting over a carcass and we accept it as “just men being men” but when women and teenage girls act passionate or excited about anything — Taylor Swift, Rupi Kaur, Justin Bieber — we call them annoying and belittle them. 
In a world where we can do no right, I propose the following: Athletes cannot compete unless they are negative for performance-enhancing substances: We let Fox News exhaust themselves until they fall asleep from reciting J.K. Rowling’s “TERF Wars,” and then, we hang a transgender flag in Tucker Carlson’s set and finally, NFL allows JoJo Siwa to perform at the Pepsi Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show next year. It’s the least they can do.

The final episode of the second season of “Euphoria” aired Sunday night, and even if you haven’t watched a single episode, I’m sure you still know everything that’s happening. From discourse surrounding Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) and Nate (Jacob Elordi) to every last Angus Cloud edit, “Euphoria” has taken over the internet. For the past eight weeks, it has been “Euphoria”’s” world, and we’re just living in it. 
No matter your thoughts on the show, it is undeniable that “Euphoria” is the moment. 
Even before the season finale, “Euphoria” amassed over 30 million tweets throughout the season’s run, currently making it the most-tweeted show of the 2020s, according to Variety. 
Its social media relevance made “Euphoria” an unstoppable force. In a world where shows shy away from running on Super Bowl Sunday, “Euphoria” tackled the challenge head-on and shined brighter than ever, reaching its highest viewership up to that point ever, at 5.1 million live watchers. This was just topped by Sunday’s finale, which reached 6.6 million viewers. The high number was because of social media jokes suggesting that Maddy (Alexa Demie) and Cassie’s fight would be the real Super Bowl showdown. 
“Euphoria’s” numbers are incredibly awe-inspiring considering that in 2021, 75% of the highest watched live television programs were football, as the Super Bowl took the winning spot. 
In the current crisis of streaming overload, “Euphoria” has its weekly release schedule to thank for its longevity. The 2010s made binge watching the norm, but the 2020s are slowly bringing back the weekly release — proven even further with the success of Disney+ hits such as “WandaVision” and “Loki.” 
However, binge watching does not necessarily stop a show’s success — “Squid Game,” which was dropped all at once on Netflix, was easily the most-tweeted show of 2021. For the month of its release, it had the same inescapable quality that “Euphoria” currently has. However, any tweets about the show were more general, mainly thoughts about the show as a whole or an analysis of the entire series, rather than slowly building up each episode. 
A show like “Euphoria” wants to be heavily analyzed. It’s not a show to which you can doze off to in bed. When a show is released all at once, it becomes harder to do an in-depth analysis of 10+ hours of television. The weekly release gives people the time to dig into each hourly episode and a whole week to do it before a new episode releases. 
Weekly release schedules leave more room for discussion, discourse and the most fun part — predictions. Also, the build-up to an episode creates a sense of community among viewers. 
Remember the stress of the week before the release of “Hannah Montana He Could Be the One: Part 2”? Would she choose Jake? Would she choose the absolutely superior option, Jesse? (Yes, I’m still mad about it). The playground was buzzing with anticipation. 
The week leading up to Euphoria Sunday takes me right back to that electric playground  feeling. TikTok predictors spend their days analyzing the previews trying to figure out every possible scenario. 
Sure, having to wait may lead to some disappointing outcomes (i.e. Hannah choosing the dirty cheater Jake over the wonderful, amazing, perfect Jesse). Still, even then, at least the weekly release schedule allows viewers to commiserate with friends, rather than immediately getting thrown into the next plot point. 
Time is especially important for a show like “Euphoria,” which deals with dark themes such as addiction and abuse. It is essential to have some time to process each episode. While some people do binge watch it, I personally appreciate having a breather. 
Binge watching will never go away. Sometimes it can ever be the preferred method — take reality competition show “The Circle.” The show only takes place over two weeks, so it makes more sense to drop it all at once, rather than stretch it out. It’s the type of show to watch over a weekend, and many people can get behind that. In fact, a poll conducted by IGN in 2021 shows that over 73% of people prefer binge watching to watching weekly. 
Binge watching may be able to give an immediate rush of fulfillment and elation (such as immediately getting to know that, in the end, Hannah and Jesse, thankfully, end up together). Still, it can never give the same satisfaction as working through the slow burn to get there. Half of the fun is the work to get to the end and going through the struggle at the same time as the characters. The true beauty of television is connection, and the way to get there is through a build-up, or as Miley Cyrus would say, “It’s the climb.”

Walking into the Bing Theater to see the School of Dramatic Arts’ production of “As You Like It,” an audience member would assume they are in for a normal Shakespeare-in-the-park-esque performance, with a traditional stage setting of forest greenery. But from the first movement onstage, a leisurely stroll from the company followed by them greeting each other as themselves rather than as their characters, lets the audience know that they are in for no ordinary Shakespearean production. 
Director Kate Burton sought to update the classic play for the present era through the inclusion of contemporary technical aspects and more modern performances from the actors. 
Before the show began, the head of SDA’s MFA program, David Warshofsky dedicated the show’s run to Andrei Belgrader, the previous director of the MFA program who passed away on Tuesday. Belgrader was an integral member of the University community for the last 14 years after joining the program in 2008. In a touching moment, Warshofsky reflected on the importance of Belgrader’s presence on the SDA program and his impact on many young actors’ lives.
After the announcement, the actors congregated on stage to introduce themselves with the house lights still up, creating a sense of familiarity between the actors and the audience. Upbeat music began playing and the house lights came down, marking the true start of the play. Although fun, this moment had little to do with the show’s general plot and set the tone for a confusing amalgamation of styles. 
The play follows the characters of Rosalind (second-year MFA candidate Emily Arancio) and Orlando (second-year MFA candidate Alex Prout) as they navigate their love through exile. Rosalind and Orlando fall in love after Rosalind watches him in a wrestling match. However, before they can foster their love, Rosalind is banished from the duchy by Duke Frederick, which the production changed to Duchess Fredericka (Lindsey Esch, an MFA candidate) to fit their version of modern Shakespeare.
Rosalind and her cousin Celia (Summer Young) decide to flee to the forest of Arden and Rosalind disguises herself as a man to avoid detection. Orlando finds himself also in the forest of Arden and runs into Rosalind disguised as a man. Rosalind, being in love with Orlando but wanting to protect him, decides Orlando must get over her. Still pretending to be a man, she dresses up as herself and acts unlovable to him. The audience follows their long, intricate and slightly confusing love story while encountering many colorful characters who bring unique personalities to the stage.
Although all of the acting performances stood strongly on their own, a shining bright spot during the play was the relationship between Rosalind and Celia. 
Shakespeare can be hard for modern audiences to understand, but both actresses made the often inaccessible Shakespearean language their own, manipulating their inflections and movements to ensure the audience understood every joke, phrase and moment of sincerity. It made the story significantly more accessible to audience members who might not be as well-versed in the works of Shakespeare. 
Jacques, (MFA candidate Levonté Herbert) expertly performed a rendition of the famous “All the World’s a Stage” monologue. Herbert enchanted the audience speaking the Bard’s words, and it felt as if time stopped. His command of the language and movement kept the audience hooked onto his every word. 
Although the acting was strong, a confusing and at times distracting element of the production was the choice in music. The production’s soundtrack ranged from ’90s hip-hop to modern-day pop, including artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, Megan Thee Stallion and Britney Spears. 
When the music played during scenes, it was difficult for the audience to focus because a much more familiar song was playing, causing the viewers’ minds to follow along with the melody, rather than the scenes. Although the songs were enjoyable to see in a modern production, they felt out of place at times. 
The technical elements of the performance highlighted SDA’s creativity but seemed to lack cohesion across the production. With costuming from the 1910s and medieval eras, a set from a traditional production of Shakespeare and music ranging from the ’90s up to modern-day pop, the discord among these facets served as a distraction rather than a commentary on the timeless nature of Shakespeare’s work. However, each element individually, even if it was confusing, was masterfully created. The costuming clearly revealed each character’s place in society, and the set’s purposeful simplicity gave the actors a space to create excellent work. 
Despite some technical elements creating confusion, the actor’s performances shined throughout the production. They brought the Bard’s words to life in a manner that was not only accessible to modern audiences but brought a fun universal message of love. 
“As You Like It” ran at the Bing Theater from Feb. 24 to 27.

Well, it’s that time of the semester again: midterm season. 
Now, it’s not your fault Rate My Professor lied to you (happens to all of us), and it turns out your easy, blow-off GE does have a problematic midterm. It’s also not your fault that you haven’t gone to class in a couple of weeks — we all do that. 
Unfortunately, you do have to take your exam, and although the next two weeks might seem like your own personal form of hell, there is a way to get through it. What is that secret solution, you might ask?
Taylor Swift. 
Swift has a song for everything, from girlboss music to motivate you on test days to sad songs to cry to after your exam. While her over 200 songs are excellent, it can be intimidating to start listening, especially when you are in a time crunch during exam season. Well, the work has already been done for you, so read, listen and immerse yourself in Swift’s melodic voice. And though unfortunately not all recommendations are owned by Swift, they soon will be. 
For a girl boss walk into your exam: 
“mad woman”
It can be hard to remain confident while walking into a challenging exam. The ultra confident peppy-upbeat bops on your usual playlist can make you want to vomit because who wants to hear fake confidence and happiness exuded in a song when you quite literally want to cry?
That is why the haunting and melodic “mad woman” is a must listen song for your walk into your classroom to ace (or potentially fail) your exam; you are reclaiming your power. It is about being gaslit, stepped on and pushed until you crack and fight back. After all, you have been poked by long boring lectures and unnecessary call-outs in class, and now it is time for the “claws [to] come out.”
For your post-midterm cry: 
“this is me trying”
It is OK to cry before, during and after the exam. Ultimately, you tried your best and it is super disheartening when you feel like that wasn’t enough. 
“this is me trying” is an absolutely devastating depiction of the pain and desperation that arises after trying your best and feeling like your best is still not enough. Exams are challenging, and it is tough to feel like your best will never be enough or that your future is out of control. 
However, “this is me trying” will bring you comfort because when you are devastated, it can be nice to hear that someone else understands your pain and can put into words the complex emotions you are experiencing. It can also be a helpful song to listen to as you’re trying to word an email to your professor pleading for an extension or retake. 
For your post-exam existential crisis: 
“A Place In This World”
Reminder: It is OK to email your advisor in the days following your exam to switch your major. Moreso, it’s OK to have doubts about your future; everyone does. 
Swift articulates feeling terrified about your future beautifully in “A Place In This World.” Swift opens this banger by lamenting “I don’t know what I want, so don’t ask me / ‘Cause I’m still trying to figure it out.” Though Swift may have only been 16 when this album was released, these lyrics really speak to any age, especially that specific age of reckoning with your life goals after bombing one of your most important midterms. 
“A Place Iin This World” will force you to reflect on how little you are prepared for life beyond college, or even life in college. So get ready for a deep, somewhat jaded and introspective dive into your feelings.  
For amping yourself up afterward:
“Change (Taylor’s Version)”
So, you didn’t know anything on that exam, probably because you never went to class nor studied. But grades are just capitalist conditioning to seek to create dehumanized, hyper-efficient laborers, so really, none of this is your fault.
Swift gets this too, and in “Change,” she perfectly illustrates the woes of late stage capitalism and the commodification of education. 
Sure, maybe “Change” was not initially written as an anti-capitalist, collegiate anthem, but in reassuring us that the undesirable parts of our world will change, Swift reminds us that social manifestation is a valid response to school (as opposed to actual school work). 
So, as you’re walking out of that classroom in shame, Swift will help you blame everything in the world and not on yourself.
For when you don’t want to check your score on blackboard:  
“closure” 
The best part about exams is that they end, but easily the worst part is checking your score. However, who says you have to? 
You don’t need closure to move on from your exam, and you are not obligated to read it. Checking your score can bring intense sadness and force you to revert to the dark days when you related to “this is me trying.” 
If seeing the notification pop up that your score has been updated on Blackboard “still spells out pain” for you, don’t check. Simply ignore your Blackboard notification and go about your day.
