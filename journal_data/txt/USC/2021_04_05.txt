Women’s soccer edged out both of its opponents with victories over Washington and Washington State this weekend, extending the Trojans’ undefeated record at home. 
Following their strong defensive performance in a victory against Arizona the previous week, the Trojans beat the Huskies 5-0 en route to their second home win in a row. The Trojans’ impressive stretch of play in conference play has improved their Pac-12 record to 6-3-1. 
After a relatively quiet first half finished 0-0, in-form junior forward Penelope Hocking displayed her heroic abilities with a hat-trick within the first 16 minutes of the second half. The first goal saw Hocking evade Washington’s defense and finesse the ball in the bottom right corner in the 52nd minute. The Trojans were awarded a penalty kick in the 55th minute after an apparent handball, which Hocking converted against Washington’s goalkeeper, Olivia Sekany. Hocking completed the trifecta in the 61st minute with a long-range shot from outside the box, hitting the top left corner.  
Senior forward Tara McKeown contributed to the onslaught of second half goals with one of her own in the 63th minute, driving into the center from the left flank before edging a shot to the bottom left corner. Freshman Katie Roditis concluded the scoring in the 84th minute with a converted shot in the box after a series of ricochets. 
Hocking credited her team’s symbiotic dynamic for her impressive run of games. 
“I think we want to work really hard for each other,” Hocking said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “That is what has fueled my work ethic, honestly. I want to work hard for the next person because I know they are going to do the work for me as well.” 
USC’s recent string of victories represents a turnaround from turbulent matches at the beginning of the season in which the Trojans suffered three losses in their opening five conference matches. 
“Now that we know what we can do, we know that we can put up those numbers, we know we’re a good team, that’s good for us because we’re going to play with more confidence,” Hocking said. “I think confidence is what we lacked at the beginning of the season.” 
USC continued its rampant run with a laborious victory over Washington State Sunday in a gritty 1-0 game. After a first-half display that saw the Cougars outshoot the Trojans 6-1, the home team flipped the switch in the second half, issuing 14 shots to the Cougars’ six and eventually converting the decisive goal. 
McKeown’s pass into the penalty box in the 55th minute was met by waiting freshman forward Angeles Escobar, who pivoted before shooting into the bottom left corner. Escobar continues to excel in her role as a super-sub, as the goal complimented her two assists in 29 minutes of play against Washington on Friday. 
“The more people we can get up there and get on the scoresheet and have an impact like [Escobar] had this weekend, will free up all of us,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I’m really happy for her, she’s been putting in a lot of work, she has looked great in training, and so I was really happy she got rewarded this weekend.”
Redshirt senior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins provided a crucial performance on the other side of the pitch, as she maintained her third consecutive clean-sheet in conference play. Sunday’s win marked USC’s fifth straight shutout at home. Collins recorded 14 saves in her last three bouts, five of which denied Washington State an equalizer Sunday.
“The team is settled by [Collins] right now — they know what she’s going to bring, they know that she can come up with some big saves.” McAlpine added. “We’re feeling good about her performance. The backline seems to be having some chemistry, some understanding in the line. That’s very much needed and necessary for us to continue the run we have been on.”
The Trojans are entering the final stretch of the season, ranked No. 13 and holding a 6-3-1 conference record. USC aims to close out the remaining three conference matches with momentum. 
“We have yet to pull together two full halves. Now, that’s the next focus. We got to play 90 minutes,” McAlpine said. “That’s the next expectation as we come into Stanford, Cal and UCLA. Tough stretch of games, really quality teams, but it’s going to require a lot of focus and ninety minutes of work.”
The Trojans will continue conference play in a string of away games, facing off against Stanford this Friday at 3 p.m. and UC Berkeley Sunday at 1:45 p.m.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t keeping an eye on the Rip Curl Newcastle Cup countdown after three days of standby. On the first day back since the Billabong Pipe Masters and Maui Pro in December and an even longer hiatus since international lockdowns were implemented in March 2020, small waves led to big results. 
It is an exciting time in competitive surfing. World champions like Tyler Wright, John John Florence and Gabriel Medina are at the height of their careers and are going against Australia natives Stephanie Gilmore and Ryan Callinan. The most memorable performances belong to the athletes that showed their small-wave prowess, including fellow Aries Filipe Toledo, San Clementian Crosby Colapinto and 19-year-old Caroline Marks.
The Australian leg of the championship tour has been defined by the World Surf League’s ability to get their athletes across the world while the coronavirus remains a looming threat to competition.
Look at the Pipe Masters. Three days after the event was called on, the WSL had to shut it down briefly due to CEO Erik Logan and other WSL staffers testing positive for the coronavirus. Of course, in any event like this, the WSL had to release the following statement:
“The WSL is committed to prioritizing the safety of the athletes, staff and surrounding community above all else, and is working closely and transparently with the Hawaii State Department of Health to determine the path forward.”
The Australian leg was in limbo as well just a few months ago. The Ballina Shire Council in New South Wales voted to turn down a CT event at Lennox Head, with local support for the no-vote apparent. One of those citizens decided to emphasize their point even further, painting “Fuck WSL” on a road near Lennox Point.
Just over a week after this debacle the WSL announced the next stops of the Australian tour in Newcastle, North Narrabeen, Margaret River and Rottnest Island. This schedule cut out iconic events at the Gold Coast Snapper Rocks and Bells Beach. 
The agreement between the WSL and the NSW Government allowed the league to charter a flight full of athletes that would travel from Los Angeles to Sydney, land in Australia and immediately enter a 14-day quarantine, all on the WSL’s dime. 
So far, there have been no coronavirus missteps; the only thing putting the event on hold now is the unfavorable conditions in the competition. 
So, was this worth it?
The benefits for athletes are undeniable — competition and or publicity is their livelihood, and with a winnings pool of over $1 million, these events continue to fund their careers.
I don’t even want to know how much the WSL spent on all of this. The excitement and fervor expected from the championship-tour host obviously did not payout. In addition, the WSL brokered a deal with some local Lennox Head surf groups in the JALI Local Aboriginal Land Council and LeBa Boardriders to have their junior surfers up for wildcard competition spots. 
Sharon Cadwallader, the deputy mayor of Lennox Head, summed up their decision briefly: “We’ve been [coronavirus]-free we don’t want that to change.”
If the council had voted otherwise, their infrastructure would have been threatened and any and all locals would be prevented from surfing for 17 days. While public health should be the end of any argument, it is important to remember that cancellation effects can compromise any world tour stop in any sort of conditions, pandemic or otherwise. 
It’ll be an interesting leg for sure. I’ll lose my fantasy picks as usual, but we’ll get to see some great surfing that has only been shown in glimpses for the past year. It would be different if the WSL forced their way into Lennox Head after a voting body said no, but in a lot of these decisions, we don’t often hear from the locals on their opinions. The encroachment of the surfing governing body and the possible degradation of communities are still some things to keep a close eye on, regardless of whether it is your community or not.

Following her travels studying abroad in Beijing in Spring 2019 that sparked a passion for learning about new people and cultures, Betty Thai’s interest in foreign service flourished. Having enjoyed the opportunity to meet new people and learn about different cultures, Thai was eager for another chance to travel abroad in the future.
After studying abroad, Thai attended a networking event held by Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s Foreign Service Society, where she learned more about career opportunities in foreign service from professionals currently working in the field. During the event, Thai became increasingly fascinated with international career opportunities, particularly the opportunity to travel and change careers frequently. 
After the event, Thai continued to research future career paths, which led her to discover the Pickering Fellowship. 
Thai, now a  senior majoring in political science and East Asian languages and cultures, received the Pickering Fellowship for foreign service in early-December — a program intended to assist low-income and historically underrepresented communities pursuing careers in foreign service.  Chosen for one of only 45 fellowships out of 1,301 applicants nationwide, Thai said she applied in hopes of securing a career that would allow her to experience the excitement of working internationally.
“I can’t believe [foreign service officers] get paid to travel and do all these incredible things. They can change careers every two to three years so they never get bored. That’s when I started like diving headfirst into all this, eager to learn what opportunities are out there,” Thai said. “So, when I learned about the Pickering Fellowship, I thought to myself, ‘yeah let’s do it.’”
Through the fellowship, Thai secured financing for a two-year master’s degree and a job within the United States Department of State as a diplomat to a foreign country. 
Thai said her passion for helping others, which she fostered through her own experiences growing up, is what motivated her to pursue a career in foreign service. 
“While I was growing up, because I’m the oldest, I had to do a lot of the translating and cultural navigating to figure out what it means to be Chinese American but also what it means to be American and Chinese,” Thai said. “I think that definitely got me started on this whole path of pursuing advocacy, policy and international life.” 
Brian Bernards, an associate professor of both East Asian languages and cultures and comparative literature who wrote Thai’s letters of recommendation, said he believes Thai’s honors thesis is one of the many things that distinguished her from the other applicants. 
In her thesis — created following Thai’s travels to Beijing — she explored the ways study abroad programs, particularly those based in China, benefit students through the opportunities they provide in cultural exchange and how this may impact the future relationship between China and the U.S. 
“Her work and goals are focused on person to person diplomatic exchanges in an international environment, particularly between the U.S. and China, to help supplement the high-level diplomacy between the two countries,” Bernards said. “She wants to help reset the U.S.-China relationship toward a more positive, more civilian-led direction rather than one led by government policy.” 
The fellowship application process included personal statements, interviews and written assessments that she worked on throughout the summer of 2020 to have them ready for the deadline in October, Thai said. Once she received the fellowship in December of 2020, she had to begin applying to graduate schools as well.
According to Bernards, Thai has many attributes that make her suitable for a career in foreign service, including her enthusiasm for academics and volunteer work. 
When she was a student in Bernards’ Global Chinese Cinema and Cultural Studies class in the fall of 2018, Thai used the opportunity to ask him questions about the study abroad experience so that she could make the most out of her own time abroad when she went the following year. 
“I was very impressed with the initiative that she took to seek out working with me. She wanted to know about my study abroad experience and asked for advice to best make use of her time while she was studying in Beijing,” Bernards said. “I’ve never really had any other student kind of come up to me and really ask those kinds of questions.” 
It was this initiative that allowed Thai to realize that foreign service is the right career path for her, Bernards said. 
While working on a reelection campaign for California State Senate Majority Leader Bob Hertzberg together in 2018, Alexa Juarez, one of Thai’s mentors, recalled how quickly Thai rose to the top as an intern. 
Thai worked as a member of the recruitment team, encouraging people to volunteer for the campaign. When a veteran member of the team got sick and could not show up to give a recruitment presentation, Juarez said Thai stepped up, even though she was still shadowing as a new member of the campaign. Because of Thai’s presentation, Juarez said the team saw their highest percentage of people who actually volunteered after signing up. 
“This was her first presentation, and I was just absolutely astonished,” Juarez said. “I truly believe that Betty’s going to go so extremely far,” Juarez said. “The sky’s the limit for her. I think she’s one in a million.”
For Thai, the Pickering fellowship will provide her with an opportunity to continue to help those in need, she said. As a diplomat, Thai will be able to influence foreign policy between the U.S. and other countries.
“I would be analyzing politics in the host country, meeting new people, and going to conferences. Then, I send notes and analysis back to Washington,” Thai said. “It’s very cool to be able to affect high level policy that way.”
Ultimately, Thai sees the fellowship as an opportunity to help people around the world. 
“I want to be in a position where I can advocate for unheard voices,” Thai said. “This [fellowship] is the perfect way to get the conversation started.” 
As Thai continues her career in foreign service, she said she wants to pay homage to her mother, who has sacrificed so much of her time and efforts to raise Thai and her brother.
Thai’s mother immigrated to the U.S. in hopes of continuing her music career as a violinist. However, she gave up this dream to support Thai and her family, learning English and earning an associate’s degree to work long hours at a medical diagnostic company. 
These sacrifices are what allowed Thai the opportunity to get an education and participate in extracurricular activities that put her on the path to where she is today. 
According to Thai, her mother’s support is the key to her success, and she owes all her accomplishments to her.

The nonprofit sector can easily be mistaken as a monolith of organizations trying to do good. Grouping all different kinds of organizations under this label is convenient. But, factors such as size, structure and effectiveness draw distinct lines within the sector. This past year highlighted differences between organizations, shattering any notions of homogeneity. Amidst the crisis, some nonprofit organizations simply worked better than others.
When large charities could not efficiently and quickly provide on-the-ground support during the onset of the coronavirus, mutual aid organizations rose to the occasion and gained long overdue public recognition. While mutual aid organizations initially surged due to the coronavirus, there’s no indication, over a year later, of an imminent downfall. Moving forward, mutual aid organizations’ emphasis on community, solidarity and reciprocity are a blueprint for future work in other areas of the nonprofit sector. 
For those, like me, who didn’t previously know the precise definition of mutual aid organizations, I want to underscore their distinction from charitable organizations. Mutual aid uses reciprocal relationships and collaboration to combat societal problems within communities. 
In response to the coronavirus, for example, the Los Angeles Mutual Aid Community Network offered grocery store deliveries, childcare, errand-running and mental health support for undocumented people, those facing homelessnness and older adults, among others. A person who picks up groceries or a prescription for a neighbor in need can later receive support, such as extra cash or childcare, from other members of the community network.  
Grass-roots organizations, community leaders and members and local nonprofits all take part in various mutual aid networks, which number 800 across the country. Rather than wealthy individuals acting as gatekeepers for charitable giving in a foundation, mutual aid organizations disperse power across a community. This allows a community to address its own needs, instead of depending on the whims and decisions of others. 
At a fundamental level, mutual aid organizations cultivate a relationship, whereas charities only give. Mutual aid organizations create sustained alliances, whereas a charity donates money to a community after a disaster in a one-way exchange. 
Although mutual aid organizations recently gained mainstream recognition, they’ve been a staple of marginalized communities for years. In the 19th and 20th centuries the poor and working class of the labor movement created “fraternal societies” to provide health care and paid leave across the country. In the 1960s, Black Panthers created a free-breakfast program that fed 20,000 children. After a devastating tornado in Greensboro, N.C. in 2018, a predominately Black, working class community came together to provide food, clothing to those who’d lost homes. Despite white and wealthy philanthropists only recently acknowledging the success of mutual aid, for centuries marginalized communities have helped themselves through this process.
A common critique of charity is that it only responds to systemic issues without actively fixing the root of the problem. On the other hand, mutual aid organizations strengthen community bonds to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. In this way, charities can learn from mutual aid’s preventative measures. Empowering communities to form strong networks sustains long-term impact in a way that a one-time grant simply cannot. 
Currently, however, most mutual aid organizations do not exist outside of metropolitan areas and major cities. Hopefully, as more people see the value in mutual aid organizations, work in big cities will be replicated in smaller communities across the country. Partnerships between community members and smaller, local nonprofits would hasten this expansion. 
While mutual aid is nothing new, it took on a more prominent role this past year by filling gaps left behind by the government and big charities’ response to the pandemic. Mutual aid paints a hopeful future in which neighbors support one another in the here and now, instead of relying on help delayed by bureaucratic tape or grant requirements. 
Without a conventional hierarchical structure, organization and source of funding, mutual aid’s survival depends on the passion and selflessness of communities. The pandemic demonstrated how community bonds can supersede other forms of support, something the nonprofit sector can learn from and reflect on during its continual process of change and reinvention.

The men’s basketball team is coming off a season that included 25 wins and an NCAA Tournament Elite Eight appearance for the first time in 20 years. A university’s athletics teams consistently serve a beneficial purpose to the school and highly successful seasons, such as the one the Trojans just had, highlight it.
Since the Varsity Blues scandal, USC’s illustrious athletic department has come under intense scrutiny from students, administrators and the outside world. It may have left some people wondering why top universities lower their admissions standards for athletes or maybe even why they allocate so many resources to sports programs at all.
Men’s basketball answered those questions this season. It starts with winning games. The sports teams need adequate resources in order to be highly competitive and when given these resources they turn out results. It is unmistakable that winning contributes to higher school spirit.
This enhanced school spirit helps stimulate the on campus community and can be an essential part of students’ social lives. Prior to the pandemic, having winning football and basketball teams brought thousands of people to USC on game days, creating buzz and a more vibrant campus.
Winning seasons also lead to advertising opportunities. Winning teams will have more chances to be on primetime national television slots, giving the university a chance to promote themselves to a wide audience during commercials. 
The uniforms also serve as advertising. During Villanova University’s men’s basketball team national championship run in March 2018, the school recorded 875,000 visitors to the university website. This came out to be a 108% year over year increase. Villanova basketball also won the national championship in 2016 and accordingly saw a 21% increase in total number of applications for 2017.
The success of a school’s athletic programs also brings in money, which has an undeniable importance to the functionality of a university. Big seasons bring in more sponsors and better television deals and help to engage alumni and solicit donations from them. For a school like USC, this means more money for financial aid programs, new classrooms, community outreach efforts and the like.
In 2016-17, a year in which the football team won the Rose Bowl, the athletic department brought in a record revenue of $113.2 million. The football team alone brought in $60 million, an $8 million increase over the year before in which they did not win a trophy. Expenses for the football team were $30 million that year, meaning they brought in $30 million for the university. 
In order to reap these benefits, universities, including USC, must continue to invest in their athletics programs so they have the resources to get the best recruits, coaches and facilities, all of which will lead to more wins.
It is clear there are strong tangible benefits to top academic universities such as USC continuing to invest in their varsity athletics. The money, advertisement opportunities, alumni engagement and community building are all great effects of having high level sports teams. However, it must not be lost upon universities that their athletes are a significant part of the student body, and it is about the individual athletes more than about any benefit the university receives from their play. 
While universities continue to benefit from the work of their unpaid athletes, they must remember to provide the resources they need to thrive off the field as well as on it.

In February, the USC Rossier School of Education announced a teaching residency program in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District to increase diversity in teaching and retain teachers with a better understanding of their communities.
Margo Pensavalle, a professor at Rossier and head of the team organizing the residency initiative, said the program is one of three of Dean Pedro Noguera’s initiatives; the other two initiatives address the emotional needs of students and work to improve civic engagement. 
She said the residency also serves to increase representation in Rossier’s Master of Arts, teaching program, specifically bringing in individuals who have experience with USC’s surrounding area so as to train teachers with closer connections to the schools they will be working with.
Student teachers spend one full year in the classroom, both working with and shadowing a master teacher, while studying at Rossier in the traditional master’s program. The student teachers chosen for this residency receive a  scholarship and living stipend equivalent to the cost of the program’s tuition, which allows them to further immerse themselves in their intended teaching communities. The program also provides opportunities for creating qualified and prepared teachers to address the needs of students, especially in South Central and the area surrounding USC’s campus.
“We started partnering with our friends in the superintendent’s office, specifically around trying to create a residency program that would not only address the need for really qualified teachers for our schools, but also address the needs of increasing the diversity of our teacher workforce,” said Bryan Johnson, the director of workforce management in LAUSD’s Human Resources division. 
Though the program is still in the interview stage, the driving force behind the program and what it aims to achieve comes from the need for men of color in teaching positions, as well as women in STEM fields — with an emphasis on representation within schools in predominantly Black communities.
“We know that it really makes a difference when students have teachers of color, and especially male teachers of color,” Pensavalle said. “We’re looking for [student teachers] who want to go in to become education specialists, because we know that there is [a] real teacher shortage in all of these areas. We’re looking to enhance the position, so we can start a sustainable kind of pipeline to increase the number of teachers from these different areas to come into teaching.”
Barriers to entry are more common in the teaching profession because of financial disparities — but through the scholarship and living stipend provided by the program, student teachers are able to better integrate into the school and receive the traditional Rossier education, with the added guarantee of a career with LAUSD after completion.
“It’s a huge recruitment strategy, but it’s also a retention strategy,” said Ileana Davalos, the deputy chief human resources officer at LAUSD. “We want to make sure that we have teachers that are committed to staying there and the best way to do that is knowing that you’re going to work at these schools.”
Studies by the Learning Policy Institute have shown that teacher residencies improve retention rates, as well as increase diversity, and are considered critically important, especially in California with the diversity of it’s communities. The LAUSD representatives further emphasized the need for commitment from incoming teachers, and this residency allows student teachers to build a stronger foundation so they’re able to take on traditional challenges from day one.
“We’re gonna really be mindful about intentional matchings between the mentor and the mentee to really increase the likelihood that they stay with the district long term, and have long, you know careers in the district and students see the benefits of that,” said Jared DuPree, a senior director in the LAUSD.
One of the biggest factors in the program’s implementation was the contributions USC made, as well as the flexibility Rossier presented in program creation, Johnson said. Access to scholarships and stipends allows student teachers more flexibility, despite not being employed by the district.
In addition, most grant funded programs are restricted by subject, usually mathematics, science, special education and bilingual education, according to Johnson. The local funding provided by USC allows for the residency program to be extended to students in less commonly sought specialties.
Giving student teachers the opportunity to commit to a year in the residency program provides an opportunity for broader understanding of how to “enact that pedagogy in the classroom,” Johnson said. “If people are able to commit to that full year, I think they’ll reap the benefits for years to come because there’s really no training like a residency program.”
A previous version of this article stated that teachers chosen for the residency receive a full scholarship and living stipend. Teachers chosen for the residency actually receive a scholarship and living stipend equivalent to the cost of the program’s tuition. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Andrew Rudy is telling stories and empowering the LGBTQ+ community through his music.
Rudy, a sophomore majoring in music industry, is working on creating his second album. As an artist, singer, songwriter and producer, he also collaborates with other artists to help them write songs. His first album, “Gold Blooded,” fully created and produced by him, just hit its one year anniversary this month.
Rudy’s first album was inspired by the sound of Melanie Martinez, particularly because of the story-like pattern she uses to construct her work.
“If you’re listening to it from track one all the way to track 12, I want you to walk away with this idea of this full arc story,” Rudy said. “And that’s exactly kind of how I’m continuing on for my second album, because I, as an artist really want to have this big story that allows people who’ve been listening from day one to follow along with the story.”
The album includes twelve songs, with the most popular singles being “Devil’s Contract” and “Do U Like Me.”Rudy is currently working on producing singles to release in addition to his second album. Although he has just recently begun producing music for others on streaming services, he has been involved in music and songwriting for much of his life. 
“I just fell in love with everything [Melanie Martinez] was doing,” Rudy said. “The songs were really not your typical songs. They touched on so many different things that pop music doesn’t really touch on, and I was like, I found that I can do this and I want to do this.”
Ever since, he has been filling up books and books with songs and ideas. Over time, he learned to add production and instrumentation behind them, allowing his music process to really evolve.
George Heffley, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies and music industry, has also spent lots of creative time with Rudy. The two started talking when they found they were in the same major and joined clubs together, including a songwriters’ forum, where the two composed songs together.
“With songwriters’ forum, we worked on a song with a few other people …, but that was our first song together. And then from there we continued to shoot ideas back and forth with each other,” Heffley said. “I actually released my first song under my name on Friday, but he helped me with the mastering process for that so we continually write ideas, share with each other.”
On the other hand, when Rudy works on solo songwriting, he often starts with the chorus to get an idea for the message and then builds from there. 
“So sometimes when I’m writing a song, I’ll have a guitar part in mind like already and I have to get that down so I’ll record the guitar part, and then I’ll build stuff off of there. Or sometimes I’ll just have a really cool kind of beat in mind like with drums and bass and everything, and I’ll get those down,” Rudy said.
Similarly, the production process has lots of unique aspects for Rudy, especially because he is fully taught and does the entirety of production on his own, from writing the song to deciding which instruments to use for production.
“The production process, it is so different for me like every time,” Rudy said. “I’m a little bit unorthodox, in the way that I do it because I produce all my songs from scratch so I don’t use any samples from like other people so everything completely comes out of my head
Sami De, a fellow artist and longtime friend of Rudy, often collaborates with him when it comes to creating album art and music videos. She has seen him grow in his musical talent, as well as confidence. 
“Speaking from someone who’s also queer, having clear representation and showing that to break the binary and to just do what he wants, and to be what you want and to show your confidence is something that listeners will definitely gain from listening to him,” De said. “Watching his music videos, it’s very unique and original and he has a very powerful voice.” 
Rudy’s song “Do You Like Me” has been his most satisfying so far. It was one of his first times writing a love song, and all the pieces fell together perfectly. However, beyond a traditional love song it addresses some of the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community.
“I felt really proud of it because on first listen, it sounds like you’re kind of just like a typical love song but I was really writing about this social anxiety that a lot of gay people face when it comes to trying to find out if if someone’s interested in them or not and the harmful repercussions that could come from asking someone,” Rudy said. 
Moving forward in his music career, Rudy hopes to continue being successful and producing music that resonates with his listeners and makes a difference in their lives.
“I just hope that when people look at me and look at my music videos and my songs, that they just feel really inspired to be themselves and to express themselves in any way that they want, no matter if they’re scared of what the people around them think,” Rudy said. “I think if I could have that effect on people that would, that would just be the best thing in the world.”

Transitioning into the Zoom era, USC’s Women of Cinematic Arts, a student organization for female and gender nonconforming students, hosted its fifth annual and first virtual Feminist Media Festival on Saturday. The club recognized the achievements of these gender minorities at USC and welcomed a variety of women in the entertainment industry to several panels, workshops and a private networking event.
The festival began with an opening ceremony featuring Ashley Strumwasser, vice president of film and television at Reese Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine. 
After an hour-long Q&A with guests, Strumwasser, a USC alumna, commented on how impressive the considerably new Feminist Media Festival is. 
“This is so great that you guys are doing this, and you’re already farther along than I ever was when I was at USC,” she said. “I love seeing all the female empowerment, and that you guys are all working together in this way to do something bigger than just yourself, so thank you.”
A panel on breaking into the entertainment industry followed, featuring USC alumnae who have quickly built up extensive experience in diverse realms of the entertainment industry. Then, workshops followed with several established guests offering hands-on help to students focused on either comedy writing and producing or short film writing.
Mia Young, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, attended the comedy writing workshop and met Shannon Hardy, an executive assistant at Fuzzy Door Entertainment. 
“She gave us so much valuable information, and I’m just really lucky that I get to go to these kinds of events and hear from such talented and accomplished alumni,” Young said.
WCA’s second panel focused on women in underrepresented fields, which led to a conversation surrounding the amount of women on set, women in animation and a lack of on-screen representation. Then, an exclusive networking event gave students an opportunity to make connections with industry professionals in a casual environment. Next, a third panel began and focused on the writer’s room, with several USC alumnae sharing their experiences as women in the writer’s room in particular.
Panelist Alex Ovadia, a writer for “Tosh.0,” offered some advice to the writers in attendance. 
“It’s important to just keep meeting people and then take initiative as much as you can, and just be cool,” she said. “Plenty of people work really hard, but have a bad attitude and don’t get asked to be on the next show, and plenty of people are awesome, and don’t work very hard, and also don’t get asked to the next show.”
Finally, all guests virtually reconvened for the screening of film submissions to the Feminist Media Festival. Script and game submissions were made accessible in advance, so guests could browse through those beforehand. 
After the screening and a brief presentation from the Women of Cinematic Arts alumni group, the closing ceremony commenced. There were over 35 submissions to the Feminist Media Festival, which led to 10 film finalists and 10 other media finalists, which comprised screenplays and games. Cinema and Media Studies Professor Anikó Imre, Animation and Media Arts and Practice Professor Kathy Smith, Business of Cinematic Arts Assistant Dean Bonnie Chi and Director of USC Game Innovation Lab Tracy Fullerton acted as the official judges.
The event awarded eight artists of underrepresented genders through four categories: Other Media for Intersectionality award, Short Film for Intersectionality award, Best Other Media and Best Film.
The Other Media for Intersectionality award was taken home by Madison Lin, a junior majoring in film and television production, for her script “Red.”
The Intersectionality Award for Short Film was taken home by Ji Lee, a junior majoring in film and television production, for her film “On the Way To.”
“A Yemeni” by Alyssa Amer, a graduate student studying film and television production, won first prize for Best Other Media, while the game “Operator” by Jasmine Persephone Jupiter, a graduate student studying game and interactive media design, took second and “La Madre Monte” by Sara Boivin, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television, took third.
“Be Full By Apocalypse” by Kayla Cao, a junior majoring in film and television production, won Best Film, while “Cool Girl Music Video” by Destinee McCaster, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, came in second and “TO FEEL A BODY” by Justine Ellen Chen, a senior majoring in film and television production, came in third.
Festival coordinator Carina Williamson, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, had been preparing for the Feminist Media Festival since May 2020. 
“I didn’t really know what I was doing when I started,” she said. “However, I was given the freedom and the reign to research my own guests. I reached out to so many incredible women, and the guests that we had come to our festival were really amazing.”
Although virtual festivals were never an anticipated element of the college experience, the Women of Cinematic Arts managed to curate an engaging day filled with important lessons for any gender minorities venturing into the entertainment industry.

USC’s Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment put on its annual FemFest, which they describe as a “counter-patriarchal music festival” . This was the first year that it was conducted virtually, but this year’s lineup was their most ambitious yet. The festival, which happened on Saturday, April 3, touted a diverse lineup of musical artists, guest speakers and drag performers, all selected under the festival’s mission to amplify the voices of women, LGBTQ+ people and people of color.
The festival was organized by a committee of 12 USC students, headed by director Nico Pizzati. FemFest’s digital headquarters was https://femfest.online, a site created specifically for the event. On the site, festival attendees could watch the stream, shop for merch from featured artists, view a list of queer resources and more. One particularly impressive feature was a custom Topia space, where festivalgoers could travel around a custom-designed digital festival grounds and video chat with other attendees. The Topia space was created by a team of six artists who each designed their own sector of the virtual map.
Among a slew of sponsors, FemFest notably partnered with the Los Angeles LGBT Center in West Hollywood to promote free access to STD testing. Those who wish to get free STD testing done at the Center can mention FemFest and receive a $25 Visa gift card, which automatically sends a $25 donation to FemFest as well.
The festival’s musical guests were divided into three groups with guest speakers and drag performers filling the gaps between. After an hour-long delay due to technical difficulties, the festival kicked off strong with the first trio, starting with singer Ayoni. Ayoni set a wonderful tone for the evening with her lush, floral setup and gorgeous vocal performance.
Next was Atlanta-based pop duo Coco & Clair Clair. With their matching black puffer jackets and signature swagger, the pair delivered a high-energy four-song set on their feet. “Wishy Washy,” their unbothered bop about wanting attention and financial support without the attachment, was an energetic standout.
R&B singer Raveena, accompanied by her guitarist, took to the spotlight next as the festival’s first headliner. She conjured up a sonically soothing atmosphere with her gentle, sweet vocal melodies and ended her set with her 2017 song “If Only,” winning the audience over with her delicate charm.
The lineup then left space for its two guest speakers to share their work. First, Nigerian American playwright, performance artist and professor Funmilola Fagbamila gave a powerful TED Talk-esque speech that tackled Black identity, especially Black womanhood and Black transness. The sheer passion with which she spoke about the Black Lives Matter movement interspersed with photomontages informed the festival’s anti-patriarchal and anti-racist stances.
Fagbamila was followed by Mykki Blanco, a rapper, activist and poet who read some of their original poetry. The poetry spoke to their free-spirited nature and creativity as an artist. 
The following trio of musical performances saw hyperpop talents caro♡, Fraxiom and Dorian Electra lighting up the stream with their futuristic sounds. Caro♡ turned heads first with her ultra-cute setup, which featured a backdrop wall covered in plush animals, and her soft, autotuned vocals. Fraxiom took audiences across cityscapes and into the fictional universe of Super Mario Galaxy with their performance’s fast-moving green screen backdrop and abrasive, intentionally chaotic music.
Electra brought high production value to their headlining set, sporting an extravagant bodysuit, a sculpted wig and their signature makeup. Taking to a neon-lit dancefloor as their stage, the gender-bending hyperpop artist performed tracks from their two studio albums “Flamboyant” and “My Agenda,” their spirit staying undeniably true to the title of the former. Electra’s performance captured the attention of festival-goers, who sounded off accordingly in the stream’s chatbox.
Drag artists Freckle, Abhora and Vander Von Odd delivered high-concept performance videos, showcasing the power of drag and providing a nice segue from the festival’s hyperpop-themed midsection to its darker final trio.
The final group of musical performances was spearheaded by Mexican industrial reggaeton act, Meth Math, who delivered a mind-boggling, visually warped set that showcased their unique sound. Next was an extensive, noisy DJ set by artist Yves Tumor that took viewers to hell and back with its dark, experimental soundscape and near-pitch-black visuals, with bright-white Tumor as the sole source of light in the frame.
Closing out the festival’s lineup was alternative pop singer Caroline Polachek with an intimate set of piano renditions seven standout tracks from her critically acclaimed debut album, “Pang,” as well as a cover of “Lady-O” by Judee Sill. Rather than feature her signature atmospheric, immersive production, Polachek stripped it back to put her classically trained, entrancing vocals on full display. Bathed in warm red lighting, Polachek brought FemFest to a beautiful and cinematic close.
But the final note of FemFest, a touching tribute to late experimental pop producer and trans trailblazer SOPHIE, was perhaps the most show-stopping moment of the entire festival. Artist and graphic designer Luke Greenwood created a 3D-animated video to SOPHIE’s anthemic “Immaterial.” The tribute beautifully summarized the spirit of the visionary producer and showcased Greenwood’s incredible rendering capabilities and apparent love for SOPHIE’s music.
Although FemFest couldn’t be held in person this year, the team of organizers impressively harnessed the opportunities of a digital platform to put together an immersive experience that showcased their most dynamic lineup to date. The festival did a fantastic job spotlighting the talents of women, LGBTQ+ artists and artists of color, all with their own distinct styles and spirits.

I wasn’t always a die-hard EXO fan (known as EXO-L). In high school, I sank deep into the dark hole of K-pop and somewhat reluctantly jumped on the BTS bandwagon, which was my one and only ult group for the longest time. With discussions of K-pop boy bands among friends, however, conversations inevitably turned toward other groups and fandoms, namely EXO.  
At that time, I was a Chinese girl who, after saying that I liked K-pop, would receive derisive responses like “but you’re not even Korean.” 
My insecurities about being a Chinese K-pop fan eventually drew me to EXO. I loved that EXO had Chinese members: Kris, Luhan, Tao and Lay. I scrolled through K-pop profiles and EXO OT12 introduction videos, discussing them with friends. I decided my bias in EXO-M was Luhan. I listened to EXO’s “Growl” in Korean. I liked it, so I listened to the Mandarin version. 
Something clicked for me then, a language that I understood and the Chinese members at the forefront of the video. I listened to it again. Then again. Then again. 
I was almost unwilling to start loving EXO. I felt irritated that to others, my love of K-pop was perceived as less valid because I was Chinese, not Korean. It was so cliché, I thought, that a Chinese girl couldn’t love a music genre if there wasn’t some sort of tangible ethnic or cultural connection I could claim. As a fan, me loving the Chinese members began as a way of somewhat retaliating against that belief. 
Yet I couldn’t deny that there was a deeper connection that drew me to EXO. In many ways, I empathized with the foreign members. Even though I wasn’t a Chinese person in South Korea, I was a Chinese person in the United States, and sometimes I saw parallels in those experiences. 
I scoured Reddit threads examining the alleged differences in treatment between the Chinese and Korean members. I watched videos of Lay accidentally mispronouncing “Jurassic Park” in Korean and remembered the distinctly different ways I pronounced “salmon” and “iron,” a way of speaking I learned from my Chinese parents. I witnessed netizens’ xenophobic hate comments toward the Chinese members, implying that they should go back to China if they were just going to leave the group anyway. 
Although our experiences were quite different, they resonated with me. Sometimes, like the members, I felt like there was a cultural gap. In the United States, I wasn’t fully accepted for being Chinese. Whenever I saw comments that undermined the members’ Chinese-ness or questioned their participation in a South Korean group, I saw myself and the questions of belonging I’d faced all my life in the Chinese members. 
As I followed the Chinese members of EXO from South Korea to China, they were what eventually drew me to Chinese popular culture at large. I watched Luhan in the Chinese variety show “Keep Running.” I watched Kris singing about noodles and haters in his hit song “Big Bowl Thick Noodle,” inspired by Chinese culture, during the Bilibili Lunar New Year concert. I watched Tao mentoring idol trainees in China’s “Produce 101” and Lay in “Idol Producer,” and I was so proud of all of them. 
I saw the former Chinese members of EXO becoming successful soloists in their country. Even as I anticipated EXO comebacks, knowing that the three Chinese members who left were most likely not going to “come back,” I loved seeing all the members thrive. I loved that there were fans who cared as much as me about the former Chinese members of EXO even when they weren’t technically in the band anymore. 
I spent significant years of my life with EXO’s members. For my Common Application essay, I wrote about how K-pop led me to discover the importance of finding community through common ground. It’s an essay topic that I think could have been refined a bit more, but to me the sentiment still rings true today. 
On the day I was rejected from my dream school, the “Love Shot” music video came out. Ironically, my rejection felt like a “love shot.” I watched the Mandarin version over and over as I sobbed nasty tears over my dinner. In my first year of college, when I felt alone and homesick in my dorm room, I opened my laptop and played EXO-M interviews on repeat, thinking about how the Chinese members of EXO would have felt in a foreign country.
I became involved in K-pop because I loved the music, and along the way I discovered commonalities with the Chinese members that have informed my own understanding of being Chinese American. In a clichéd way, maybe that’s what boy bands are about: less about the fandom wars and politics, and more about finding yourself in others. 
A lot has been said about K-pop as Korean “soft power” (see what I did there?), and there’s truthfully nothing more I can add to the K-pop discourse. As a Chinese American, though, I can’t deny that paradoxically, it was the Chinese members of a South Korean boy band that helped me navigate what it meant to be a Chinese person in the United States. 
Their lives — or what I consumed of their lives, anyway — mirrored my own struggles with belonging and cultural identity, ideas that have always defined my own experiences. For that, I thank them. No matter how much I wish for it, I’ll never debut as an idol. But with the Chinese members, I “debuted” in a different way — a Chinese American one.

Trigger Warning: This review contains mentions of sexual abuse. 
As the first Netflix French biopic dedicated to the woman Vanity Fair praised as “legendary,” “Madame Claude” is, paradoxically, not très bon. The film focuses on the story of its titular character, Madame Claude (Karole Rocher), and her life running Paris’ thriving sex work industry in the 1960s. 
It centers on Madame Claude gradually forming a strong relationship with Sidonie (Garance Marillier), a new worker who becomes her “right-hand woman” and closest confidante as Madame Claude navigates challenges in her personal and professional life.
There’s a strong element of the male gaze throughout “Madame Claude.” Ultimately, this physicality feels a bit uncomfortable at times, but it does serve a somewhat greater purpose as the film’s self-referential interpretation of sex work. Women are always portrayed in voyeuristic terms, their bodies magnified and put on display. Even conversations around women trace back to how physically “desirable” they are.
Rocher does a compelling job of portraying Madame Claude, who is aloof and demanding but also vulnerable. She frequently gives voiceover narratives of her issues with physical and emotional love in the past. These issues are then interwoven with scenes of her present-day realities selling intimacy as the lead businesswoman of the sex work industry. 
These transitions between time end up a bit jarring and interrupt the flow of the story. However, they’re also a reminder that “Madame Claude” is intended to be first and foremost a biopic. This is a woman whose work is full of tension between public persona and private identity. The tensions in Madame Claude’s life subsequently feed into a larger narrative about the intersection of sex work and women’s identities.
In the film’s desire to portray sex work in all its complexity, though, it leaps headfirst into risqué territory and frequently and excessively makes the most out of its rating for mature audiences. That isn’t at all unwarranted, of course, but it doesn’t really add much to Madame Claude’s development as a character, which is the selling point of the story. 
In fact, it’s worth asking if the film ends up conforming to a male gaze even as it seeks to show how women are affected by the sexualization of their bodies and professions.
If the goal of the film was to provide a darker rendering of the challenges associated with sex work, it does an effective job at that. At one point, one of Madame Claude’s workers, Virginie (Liah O’Prey), is physically abused by her clients for $200,000. It leaves Virginie tearfully fearful about the nature of her profession. Other workers are similarly forced to endure degrading, dehumanizing treatment. 
However, “Madame Claude” doesn’t really explain any of these scenes and their implied connections to gender-based violence; instead, it chooses to repeatedly showcase the eroticism of women’s bodies. This becomes exhausting for those who want to view women as more than the sexualized objects they’re presented as. It leaves the viewer wanting to fast-forward or skip to the parts that show the main narrative of Madame Claude challenging and taking her place in a man’s world, as marketed in the trailer. 
There’s no denying that the film depicts a comprehensive picture of sex work. It’s just that there’s so many graphic scenes that emphasize feminine sensuality that they don’t fully grapple with the gendered dynamics these interactions occur within. The sheer abundance of such scenes scattered throughout don’t execute a meaningful story about how Madame Claude negotiates with the power and politics involved in her job. 
There’s some mention of conflicts with powerful men and legal authorities, but it doesn’t particularly lead up to anything purposeful. There’s some speeches from Madame Claude about how men run everything and the injustices of the world, but those feel like contrived moments. There’s an attempt to give Madame Claude some depth through the voiceovers of her past, but the fact that Madame Claude always spells out the events in her past might leave viewers feeling like they aren’t trusted to figure out the details themselves. 
In short, there’s no subtlety, which is much needed in a film like “Madame Claude” where context needs to be everything. “Madame Claude” might satiate viewers who want to view the explicit nature of the 1960s Paris sex work industry. For those who want to explore a complex portrait of Madame Claude beyond her mythos, this isn’t that film.
