 
As the USC vs. UCLA game quickly approaches, Residential Student Government is getting USC students hyped to beat the Bruins with their annual event, Save Tommy Night. The carnival occurs right before the USC vs. UCLA game and features a wide variety of activities and entertainment to raise spirits and school morale before the big game. This year’s event will happen this Friday night in Alumni Park from 6 p.m.  to 10 p.m. and will feature games, activities, food and live music from some of USC’s best talent.

RSG throws a variety of events each year from the Highlighter Dance to Spirits at Troy, along with various events and initiatives throughout the residential community.
Save Tommy Night will feature a wide variety of performances, from spoken word to acapella. The night will include acoustic acts from singer-songwriters such as Livey Beha, Carrie Zhang, McCall Kimball, Leo Xia and Julia Ryan, who will grace the evening with thoughtful lyrics, soothing melodies and stand out vocals.
Also performing will be USC’s East Asian Acappella team the Trogons, who work to expose USC students to East Asian cultures. The Trogons have performed throughout the L.A. area, including the Moon Festival Celebration in Irvine, The Los Angeles Lantern Festival and more.
Additionally, Save Tommy Night will feature two spoken word artists, Alex Luu and Maxwell Suzuki, from Slam SCene, formerly known as the USC Slam Poetry Team.
While Suzuki is new to the team, Luu is a slam veteran who has had his work featured in publications like The Huffington Post, Write About Now and All Def Poetry. Luu has performed in various competitions throughout the country and is currently a poet ambassador for Get Lit: Words Ignite.
Other student performers include Ladell, Livey Beha, Julia Ryan McLane and Carrie Zingers.
Finally closing out the night will be an electrifying performance from Roxxy Floyd, a high energy band comprised of USC students and alumni. Roxxy Floyd plays a variety of genres including rock, pop, soul and more, but defines themselves as a genreless band. The band has performed in various clubs in Los Angeles, such as the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, the Viper Room, Molly Malone’s, The Mint, Amplyfi and the Chain Reaction.
RSG has not announced the games and activities for the night, but previous years have featured a bean bag toss, a photobooth, a giant hamster wheel and more. The event will also feature food from the Boba Truck as well as the Grilled Cheese Truck.
Save Tommy Night is a free event open to all USC students.

We all have our tales of heartbreak from middle school. A story more tragic than any Shakespearean play was my first relationship in ninth grade — that girl was everything to me. She gave me many firsts. She was the first girl who sent me “XOXO” on MSN Messenger. She was the first person I held hands with. She was the first person I kissed.
This was all until one fateful Christmas morning when I got an email from her. The subject title: “This might hurt a little…” In all honesty, it hurt… a lot. It hurt in the ways a 14-year-old boy could hurt — and that is a freakin’ lot. So that’s how my first relationship ended. Your boy got dumped via email on Christmas morning. Merry Christmas.
Fast forward three years. It was my senior year of high school. I found myself at a camp where students from all around Sydney come. There were a bunch of empowering lectures and talks, and, lo and behold, my “Merry Christmas, we’re over, bro” ex-girlfriend was there too! By this time it had been three years. In middle-school/high-school years that’s like 30 years of time passing. Water under the bridge, as you Americans say.
I said hey to her and was like, “Woah! It’s been ages. Good to see you!” I thought nothing much of it and made my way to the cabin.
Now, one of the camp activities was to ask someone to this big prom-style dance at the end of the week. And so, being the goofy guy I am, one of the evenings in front of the whole camp, I did this huge performance where I played guitar, did some dancing, made some jokes and asked my friend Vivien to the dance. It was pretty fun — everyone loved the performance and the night ended on a high note. The next morning was a little interesting, though. I bumped into my ex from ninth grade and said hey again. She responded curtly, and with a hesitant tone she followed up with a question: “Hey, Sam… Can we… Can we go for a walk?”
“Hm? Oh. Yeah, of course,” I replied.
We started to walk by the camp’s nice, scenic lakeside. We were making some small talk when all of a sudden, with no warning or pre-emptive AMBER Emergency Alert text, she randomly started bawling her eyes out. Like a river — no, a waterfall — no, a flashflood started gushing out of her eyes.
“I’m just so sorry. Seeing the man you’ve become, I am just so sorry for letting you go…” she managed to get out, her words interspersed with breathing spasms and sniffles. “I know it has been three years,” she continued, “but I haven’t let you go.”
Wow. This was everyone’s dream. This was it! This was the moment every single person in life desires and dreams for and prays for. It’s the very thing we live life for — it’s the reason we work out and get fit after we break up with someone. It’s the reason our Snapchats are filled with attractive people. And it was right in front of me. Ninth grade Samuel who was dumped on Christmas morning was screaming — he was in “I can’t even” mode on steroids. But in this moment, I thought about all the hurts I had had and all the hangups I had still held onto with others, and let the moment pass.
I patted her on the shoulder. “We were both young at the time. Don’t worry about it. We both learned a lot from that relationship.”
This time of semester is an interesting period for a lot of people. It’s when a lot of students are ending long distance relationships that are fizzling out of heat after a passionate summer. It’s the time that the weather gets a little colder and our withdrawal symptoms from the warmth of cuddle buddies hurts extra badly. I feel it too. Past relationships or past situations trouble us on replay after replay. I find myself violently switching between, “What did I do wrong?” and “How could I have done different?” to name-blaming and bitterness more bitter than the late-night lemon lime bitters at my local bar. As Christmas approaches once more this year, all I want for Christmas is closure.
Closure is a hard thing. It’s very confusing. There’s a lot that people say about how to find closure: make yourself busy, find someone else or have a good conversation with that person. There’s a lot out there that I’m sure you all already know. So for this article, I just want to give two additional ways of finding closure that I think might help some right now or in the future.
One great way to find closure is by breaking certain memories that that person owns in your heart. Do it again.
Go to the places that you shared only with your ex and go with other friends that make you laugh and give you a reason to smile again when you pass said place. I find that that helps so much. I’ve taken my squad to romantic date spots that I used to go with people I was hung up with. It’s kind of weird at first, but it is actually quite nice.
And for those nights where you’re up late at night and you’re feeling a way and you know you shouldn’t text them but their name is already on your “Send New Message” header: become a Daily Trojan columnist and write your feelings out. It’s very therapeutic. Haha, just kidding. But seriously, it’s great to find an outlet, whatever it may be, and allow yourself to feel the feelings you have. I find in our instant change, dad diet and LTE network culture, we have a pressure to be perfect the next day. But, it shouldn’t be that way. The same way we tell people that they should mourn for separation from a loved one departing into the next life, we need to allow ourselves time to mourn the separation of a season of life with specific people.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. I’m sure that there are many things this Thanksgiving that you could be thankful for, and I hope that one of them for you could be closure.

In a longstanding tradition of bringing behind the scenes looks at upcoming Disney animated films to USC, head of animation Amy Smeed held a presentation to discuss Moana, the highly acclaimed Disney animated feature that is set to hit theaters on Thursday.
Photo from Walt Disney Animation StudiosHawaiian rollercoaster ride · Moana, which means “ocean” in Polynesian, is an upcoming 2016 American 3-D computer-animated musical fantasy adventure film that features Disney’s first Hawaiian princess.
Moana is the tale of Pacific Islander Moana (Auli’i Cravalho), a chieftain’s daughter who teams up with the shapeshifting demigod Maui (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) to save her people by ending a millennium of unrest at sea. Through her journey, Moana learns about her destiny to restore her people’s lost past of being wayfinders, which are non-instrumental navigators deeply rooted in Polynesian culture. Moana represents the modern-day Disney princess by telling a story of self-discovery and empowerment for its spirited young protagonist.
“[Disney princesses] have evolved over the years,” Smeed said, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “When you look at stories like Snow White and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty versus the types of stories that we’re telling today, Moana goes out on her own. She doesn’t need someone to help her.”
As head of animation, Smeed ensured that the film’s enormous team of animators were animating the characters in a consistent manner. Moana was a particularly special project for Smeed herself, as she was appointed to become Disney’s first female head of animation for a feature film. She cited being a female animator as a reason behind her desire to speak at universities like USC.
“The reason why I love going to [events] with lots of students is there aren’t a lot of women in animation,” Smeed said. “I hope when I come to things like this that it’s an inspiration for other women out there to go for it.”
Smeed’s other duties pertained to ensuring that the visions of Moana’s directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, were always being upheld. One of Smeed’s favorite parts of being on the Moana project was working with these two legendary artists, whose prior work includes Disney classics like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.
“Getting to work with Ron and John was a childhood dream,” Smeed said. “They’re my heroes. Thinking of when I was little watching The Little Mermaid and now being able to sit next to them and work so closely to them was just a huge, huge honor and a dream come true.”
Beyond casting voice actors of Oceanic descent, Clements and Musker were acutely aware of the film’s greater responsibility to authentically portray Polynesian culture. To this end, the directors embarked on multiple trips to Polynesia with a group of artists in tow, meeting with the people whose stories they would be bringing to the big screen.
In an unprecedented move, Disney also set up the Oceanic Trust, a diverse group of linguists, anthropologists and even tattoo artists who advised the filmmakers on how to portray Polynesian culture. Smeed recalled a particularly poignant meeting with a master of wayfinding, Nainoa Thompson.
“Meeting Nainoa Thompson was amazing,” Smeed said. “He had so many stories about sailing and people that he’s met, and wayfinding, which was such a huge part of our story. Having people like him come in and start to learn about a culture that I really didn’t know much about was a huge inspiration.”
Technologically, Moana was also difficult because of the film’s many hair and water effects; in the end, entirely new programs had to be developed to fully encapsulate the film’s artistic vision. However, the results were spectacular — Moana is vibrant, rich with detail and pulsating with visual energy.

A USC student was found dead at approximately 5 p.m. on Thursday at the Gamma Epsilon Omega fraternity house, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Though the individual’s name will not be released until the next of kin have been notified, LAPD said that he is believed to have been a member of the fraternity. LAPD and the USC Department of Public Safety are conducting an ongoing investigation and have not yet confirmed the cause of death. 
Paramedics were already on the scene when LAPD and DPS officers arrived and found the student unresponsive. Captain William Hayes of the LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division said that the death is currently being investigated as a possible suicide, and officers do not believe hazing was involved.
Hayes said residents of the fraternity house became concerned because the student had not been seen since 2 a.m., and when they went to check his room, they discovered his body. Additionally, DPS Chief John Thomas said that the information gathered so far indicates that the student’s death was not related to academic pressures. 
USC Student Affairs and Student Counseling Services arrived on the scene later in the evening to provide residents of the house with emotional support.  
The Gamma Epsilon Omega fraternity, which is unique to USC, is the first Asian-interest fraternity in Southern California. It was established in 1963 and was the first minority organization to have a house on the Row.
RIP – but the first Asian interest fraternity on the row, at the same house for 16+ years was Beta Omega Phi
Gammas were on the row in the 80s

With only two home games left this season, the women’s volleyball team looks to repeat their victories against Oregon State and Oregon this Friday and Saturday. These games will help determine their ranking for the NCAA tournament. 
Alexandra Ting | Daily Trojan
“Oregon State and Oregon are really critical in order to insure a good place in the tournament,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We can move up in the RPI standings if we beat Oregon. Otherwise, we are putting ourselves in jeopardy.”
However, even though USC swept Oregon State and defeated Oregon in four sets on the road the last time they met, the Women of Troy are prepared for both opponents to come in and force them to earn their victory, as they each will be coming from playing UCLA right before.
“The second time you expect them to be the same as the first time, and they never are,” Haley said. “All the teams bring something different the second time. People try harder if they had a good match or a bad match. You really have to be diligent and accept the challenge that it is going to be a good competition.”
USC’s record reflects the struggles they have been facing in winning games at home, but Haley is hopeful that his players are ready to face both opponents. For the games, he wants his team to use this time at home to fully prepare for the matches and be in a mindset to win.
“I gave them three things,” Haley said. “We want to try to eliminate all the distractions, be organized and be focused on the team we are playing for that night. Now it is just a matter of if can we play, end of the semester, tests, all of this stuff, can we keep all of this organized and come out and give our best effort.”
Not only are these games important to their final ranking for the tournament, but these are also the last two home games for the seniors. Their senior night will be on Saturday and will take time before the game to honor all they have accomplished as players during their time at USC. For the seniors, these games mean more as the end of their collegiate careers is almost upon them. 
“The seniors look forward to the recognition of the time they have put in representing their school and the appreciation from the alumni and students that come and support them,” Haley said. “It is an important tradition that we have.”
Ultimately, the Trojans will have to battle to not let their last meetings with their opponents lead them into a false sense of security, and they will have to enter both games with high intensity. If they do that, the women’s volleyball team have a good chance of adding two more wins to their record. 
“We have to be courageous and go in and fight to win ugly or win well,” said Haley. “We just need to win.”
The Women of Troy face Oregon State at 7 p.m. on Friday night before taking on Oregon in a 5 p.m. match on Saturday.

For players, coaches and fans alike, the crosstown showdown between USC and UCLA is a long-awaited treat at the end of the season. With just two weeks left before bowl season, the No. 13 Trojans (7-3) will travel to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena to face the Bruins (4-6).
Brian Chin | Daily TrojanBeat the Bruins · Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and the football team are traveling across town to take on UCLA. The Trojans have defeated the Bruins in 13 of their last 17 meetings, including last year’s 40-21 win.
The teams have undergone quite different storylines as this season has progressed. Having won six straight, USC vaulted up in the College Football Rankings this week after defeating playoff contender then No. 4 Washington, but head coach Clay Helton has been working to keep his players focused on the task at hand this week.
“We have a job to do,” Helton said. “That’s been the overriding emphasis each and every week: do our job, on this day, in this moment. And that’s what I’m going to keep selling.”
The Bruins have struggled without their starting quarterback Josh Rosen, who was replaced by redshirt senior Mike Fafaul. The Bruins have relied heavily on their passing game as they are averaging just 87.2 rushing yards per game. Sophomore defensive end Porter Gustin emphasized the need to maintain that standard in this game.
“We’ve talked all week about establishing that they’re not going to run the ball on us early,” Gustin said. “Making them one dimensional and getting after the quarterback, that’s a key for sure.”
The Trojans will most likely be without junior defensive tackle Josh Fatu who is suffering from an ankle injury. The team expects to be at full strength on the offensive side of the field. The team is preparing for a Bruin defense that is extremely effective on third down.
“Not only one of the best secondaries that we’ve faced, but also one of the defenses with the best third down efficiency,” Helton said. “They come in right at 32 percent, which is one of the top three in the league.”
Combatting a staunch defense will be a Trojan offense that ranks second in the Pac-12 at third down efficiency, coming in at 46.2 percent, showing that the effort USC has put into third downs each week at practice has paid off.
“That’s a key battle of keeping drives alive on the field,” Helton said.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has impressed the nation during his tenure as the starting quarterback.
“Everyone is seeing touches and everyone is making plays,” junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said.
Darnold leads the nation in touchdown passes, completion percentage, yards per attempt and passing efficiency this season among freshman. He has thrown 22 scoring passes this year. Darnold is ranked fifth in the nation in ESPN’s Total QB Rating and is the highest rated freshman.
Darnold has been able to spread the wealth among his receivers, not just targeting Smith-Schuster but also making names for wide receivers senior Darreus Rogers, sophomore Deontay Burnett and redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe.
“Smooth is the right word to describe Tay (Deontay Burnett),” Darnold said. “Tay is just one of those players who knows how to get open and knows how to do his thing once the ball comes to him.”
Helton hasn’t downplayed the rivalry aspect of this week, but has said several times that he is trying to keep his team as calm as they can be. Smith-Schuster said on Tuesday that the coaching staff talked to the team in order to help them refocus after the Washington win and to not get caught up in the hype of the rivalry.
Last year, the Trojans won 40-21 at the Coliseum, but the year before suffered a defeat at the Rose Bowl, 38-20. The 2014 win is just the fourth win the Bruins have had in the last 17 meetings.
“The more and more the day comes closer, you get more excited,” Smith-Schuster said. “It’s a big rivalry game and everyone is excited, but you just have to keep calm.”
The Trojans need to win on Saturday to keep their hopes of a Pac-12 South title alive in addition to needing Utah and Colorado to each lose one of their remaining two games.
“The one thing I’ve been proud of this team for the past six weeks is we haven’t been about the hype,” Helton said. “We say execution fuels emotion.”

It was a wet and bitter cold September night at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Utah, but USC was weathering the storm. Taking a 10-point lead into the fourth quarter, the Trojans looked primed to upset the Utes to get back to .500 after a rough start to the season.
Instead, they were outscored 14-3 in the fourth, blowing the coverage on a game-winning touchdown in the final seconds to drop a heartbreaker and fall to 1-3 for the first time since Pete Carroll was a rookie head coach.
After the game, the players held a team meeting where several veterans spoke up, according to redshirt junior defensive back Chris Hawkins. Those who addressed the team included Hawkins, junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, senior linebacker Michael Hutchings, redshirt senior offensive tackle Zach Banner and even redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne, who had just lost his starting job to redshirt freshman Sam Darnold.
The common theme? Something needed to change.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanFreshman on fire · Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has been a large factor in turning the Trojans’ season around. Darnold has thrown 22 touchdowns, the most by any freshman in the country.
“Just our intensity on the field,” Hawkins said on what was discussed during the meeting. “It seemed like everybody wasn’t giving 100 percent. When you get attacked by your own teammates, then you start to look at yourself and ask how you’re giving 100 percent.”
Since that meeting, the Trojans have won all of their subsequent games — six in all — the most impressive being their stunning upset of then-No. 4 Washington last Saturday in Seattle. They went from receiving no votes in the AP Top 25 poll to a No. 13 ranking by the College Football Playoff committee this week. They’ve turned the corner for good, found arguably one of the best quarterbacks in college football and are back on their way to glory — and yet, the fate of this season may still end somewhat sour because of that blown lead in Utah.
In order to stay alive in the Pac-12 South, USC must beat UCLA on Saturday and hope that either Colorado or Utah lose. For the Trojans to win the division outright, both the Buffaloes and Utes have to lose at least one game — if they both win on Saturday afternoon, USC will be eliminated even before its game at the Rose Bowl starts at 7:30 p.m.
If USC had beaten Utah, it would be 8-2 and in control of its own destiny. But if it was indeed the team meeting following the loss that sparked a change in mindset and the six-game win streak that ensued, then the fourth-quarter collapse served a necessary purpose to the season. Though, with a cruel twist of fate mixed in, it might have cost the Trojans a shot at a Pac-12 championship and a spot in the Rose Bowl.
FiveThirtyEight gives USC a 20 percent chance of winning the Pac-12 if it beats UCLA and Notre Dame, a projection that seems about right. The Trojans’ most likely path to the Pac-12 South title involves three outcomes that must happen — beating UCLA, Colorado losing to Washington State on Saturday and Utah losing to Colorado next week.
But let’s not allow these hypothetical scenarios to take away from what the Trojans have accomplished since losing at Utah in September. Head coach Clay Helton’s job, which was in doubt after four weeks, is now as secure as it has ever been. Darnold, a name barely familiar to USC fans before this season, has an even brighter potential than the Kesslers, Sanchezes and Barkleys who have recently passed through this program. And as a whole, USC — which has become known more for off-the-field drama than actual football — is back to being a team that nobody wants to play.
Even if they don’t get the help they need to win the Pac-12, the Trojans’ future has flipped from bleak to bright, especially considering Darnold has three more seasons of eligibility. I’m not one to heap endless praise on players unless they’ve truly earned it, but Darnold absolutely has. His mobility keeps defenses on their toes, but his arm strength and poise in the pocket keeps them honest. His elusiveness makes him virtually immune to sacks, and his ability to both run and throw at an elite level is unfair.
To get a peek at the next three years of USC football, take a look at the nine-play, 82-yard drive Darnold engineered right before halftime of the Washington game that culminated in a rushing touchdown by sophomore running back Ronald Jones II. Darnold ran the up-tempo, two-minute drill to perfection, throwing surgical darts all over the field and barely giving the vaunted Huskies defense a chance to breathe. It quieted what had been an electric Husky Stadium crowd and convinced me that not only would USC pull off this upset, but also that Darnold will have many pieces of silverware in his trophy case before his playing days are over.
If Darnold’s career takes off, this was the game where he went from “shiny new toy” to “the next big thing.” And if this is the start of the revitalization of USC football, remember the Utah game for giving us our first glimpse of him, for giving the team the impetus to band together and, in Hawkins’ words, play “the best ball USC has seen in a long time.”
There are plenty of fun moments left in this season — the impending rivalry wins over UCLA and Notre Dame are a good start. But regardless of whether or not the campaign ends in the Rose Bowl, next season and beyond finally look like national championship-contending seasons for USC football.

USC women’s soccer welcomes Texas A&M to McAlister Field on Friday for the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 Women of Troy (15-4-1) grabbed an opening-round victory last week taking down Eastern Washington 3-1, and they are looking to keep their championship hopes alive with a win over the Aggies.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanAll on the line · Senior forward Morgan Andrews and the Women of Troy are hosting their second game of the NCAA tournament on Friday when they face off against Texas A&M in the second round.
After going on a 12-1 midseason tear, USC stumbled going into the tournament, going 1-1-1 in its final three games and losing to UCLA in the regular season finale. But head coach Keidane McAlpine was impressed with his team’s rebound against the Eagles.
“We gained some confidence as a team in what we were doing,” McAlpine said. “Then, slowly but surely, you get in rhythm and the game starts to take shape for you.”
Now, the Women of Troy’s focus shifts to Texas A&M. The Aggies won’t blow anyone away with their 12-8-1 record, but they advanced further than USC in last year’s tournament, when they lost to Florida State in the Elite Eight. Needless to say, McAlpine wasn’t about to underestimate his team’s opponent.
“I think they’re a team that’s hungry. They feel like their season was taken from them a bit with injuries,” McAlpine said. “They’ll come out here with a very experienced and determined performance.”
Going up against a veteran squad in the postseason is always a challenge regardless of the team’s record, so McAlpine was happy to make the Aggies come to Los Angeles instead of flying his side out to College Station.
“They get to stay in class, which is always good for them,” he said. “It calms their nerves a bit in terms of their everyday load, so that’s massive for us.”
McAlpine listed more advantages that could give the Women of Troy a crucial edge on their home field, from the impact of the fans to players being able to sleep in their own beds.
“They just accentuate the performance,” McAlpine said. “They make it a little bit easier to go out and perform well.”
Of course, continuing to advance in the tournament also gives USC seniors extra opportunities to run onto the McAlister Field pitch. McAlpine said that motivation drives both veterans and younger players on the squad.
“I think that’s always a special thing for [the seniors],” McAlpine said. “You play your last game, and then all of a sudden you get another one. We’re going to try to get them as many as we possibly can.”
The Women of Troy kick off against the Aggies at 1:30 p.m. on Friday. The game will be broadcast from McAlister Field on the Pac-12 Network.

Yesterday, banners reading “Black Lives Matter” were raised on campus along Trousdale Parkway and within the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The raising of these banners was the result of a joint effort between USC’s Graduate Student Government and Undergraduate Student Government, with the support of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, Asian Pacific American Student Services, El Centro Chicano and the LGBT Resource Center. The banners will remain up for about two weeks.

Over the past several years, the issue of police violence targeting black individuals and communities — violence that often results in injury or death — has seen increased, sustained attention from the American people. Directly following George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin, the #blacklivesmatter hashtag went viral, eventually leading to the founding of the Black Lives Matter movement by Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Ganza and Opal Tometi.
Inspired by the raising of a flag stating “Black Lives Matter” at the University of Vermont in September, GSG and USG decided in September that it was important to state our unequivocal support for black lives on this campus. The spike in hate crimes over the past week and a half — including on this campus — further proved the necessity of such a message. This statement of affirmation is a small way of recognizing the unique challenges facing many students within the Trojan Family, and a reminder that our advocacy must include representing populations that, for too long, have remained underrepresented and marginalized not just on our campus, but across the country.
Due to the decentralized nature of the Black Lives Matter movement, this statement should not be read as a blanket endorsement of every Black Lives Matter chapter or their visions, demands and tactics. Moreover, no one within GSG or USG believes that black lives matter more than, or at the expense of, other lives. Many of this initiative’s strongest supporters also work for the benefit of other marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+, disabled, undocumented, indigenous, and low-income communities. In other words, the statement should not be understood as “only Black lives matter,” but that “black lives matter, too.” This initiative recognizes that black lives have historically not mattered — and still do not matter — as much as other lives in America. We, as a Trojan family, must acknowledge this fact as we work to create a more diverse, equitable, accessible and inclusive University.
We understand that Black Lives Matter has become a controversial issue nationally, that some may find this statement improper, and that many individuals have unwavering thoughts on this issue. However, as campus leaders, we encourage all students to reflect critically on what our campus — and our country — would look like if the lives of today’s systemically marginalized groups had mattered from the start. GSG and USG are dedicated to fostering an inclusive campus with the help of the student body, and this statement is but a starting point. Will you join us?

Now that President-elect Donald Trump has secured the Presidency, he has begun outlining plans for education for his first 100 days in office, most of which are problematic concerning the prospects of equitable and high-quality public education under his future administration. His school choice model, in which parents can use vouchers to pick whatever school they would want their child to attend, would fund more popular schools, and close less popular ones.
In theory,  his plan sounds like a good idea, as one would think that better performing schools would attract more students, and receive more funding as an incentive to continue to educate students well. However, studies have illustrated that higher performing schools tend to perform better because of differences in funding. In other words, schools with higher funding levels, which tend to be in more wealthy school districts, have more resources and more qualified teachers for students, which help students to perform better. Thus, Trump’s plan of operating education like a business, in which “good” schools are rewarded and “bad” schools are punished, only reinforces privilege that is already prevalent throughout our nation’s public education system.
The low performing schools that would be closed would be those in low-income neighborhoods with students from nondominant racial, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds, who would really benefit from a high quality education the most. This idea that competition is the best way to improve our nation’s schools embodies the idea of neoliberalism, which is the belief that competition and markets can determine a hierarchy of winners and losers, thereby creating a more efficient system. Introducing markets into schooling would not only perpetuate privilege — by benefiting the wealthy and harming the poor — but would move our schools closer to treating education like a commodity, instead of viewing it as a public good, in which everyone should benefit. By utilizing education as a public good, and implementing social welfare programs to aid student’s success, similar to the policies found in countries like Cuba and Finland, the United States can move toward ensuring equal access to a high-quality education for all students.
In a country that prides itself on equality, why have inequalities of opportunities persisted for low-income and minority students? One possible reason is the two contradictory biological and social influences. Biologically, eugenicists perpetuate the antiquated idea that intelligence is inherited, whereas education researchers argue that systemic hegemony dictates school funding, resources and curriculum, thereby perpetuating fewer educational opportunities for low socioeconomic students. While eugenics gained popularity during WWII, a more recent work from 1994 entitled The Bell Curve contains similar themes, including the belief that “relative differences between the white and black populations of the United States, as well as those between men and women, have nothing to do with discrimination or historical and structural disadvantages, but rather stem from genetic differences between the groups.” However, education scholars have demonstrated through numerous studies, as this column has argued, that there is a social explanation of educational inequality of opportunity, such as differences in funding like Trump’s plan proposes.
The United States holds dearly the idea of a meritocracy, where anyone can do well in school and succeed if they try hard enough. This myth ignores privilege differences that act as the social basis for why there is inequality within our educational system. When analyzing countries that consistently produce high achieving students, like Finland, most of them also implement social programs to reduce opportunity gaps between high and low socioeconomic students. Finland, similar to Cuba, which was highlighted in last week’s article, has high levels of redistribution of wealth, essentially lowering income inequality. Moreover, Finland has a well-developed welfare state, which enables it to provide its citizens with high quality early childhood education, universal healthcare and high upward mobility.
Not only would Trump’s system create more winners and losers, it would also continue to perpetuate a system of education where privileged students perform better, and the students with lower social mobility and access to resources would perform worse. By addressing and remedying the worsening income inequality gap through the implementation of social welfare programs like early childhood education and universal healthcare, the United States can better ensure that all students are receiving a high quality education.

“In theory,  his plan sounds like a good idea, as one would think that better performing schools would attract more students, and receive more funding as an incentive to continue to educate students well. However, studies have illustrated that higher performing schools tend to perform better because of differences in funding. ” Actually the city of New York proves your counter point wrong. In New York City we have charter schools which are non unionized and private owned. Money one would pay to go to public is redirected to the Charter upon your acceptance. And the better teaches are at these schools because they paid more and the merit based system is better. Education was improved in New York City up until DeBlasio fought the charters and sided with Unions. Now the school system is worsening, charters are becoming less effective due to Government regulation and pro public school policies, over all leading to a worse off New York City. And you know who benefited the most from the Charter schools? Poor African American communities.

There is a certain amount of outrage every election cycle, but the emergency protests which took place in Los Angeles felt incredibly different. Looking at the signs that were around me, they read more like a human rights protest than political unrest.
People were whooping and hollering as a lady stood in the middle of the street with her sign reading “end sexism now.” Another man was writing “f-ck your white supremacy” on as many blank white T-shirts as he could.
Though there was plenty of graffiti with “f-ck Donald Trump” littered across the city, the atmosphere was more positive than one would imagine. For every negative sign, there was at least one next to it with a message of love, hope and unity. This was a gathering of citizens who were scared and united in the fight to ensure that basic human rights were afforded to themselves and their brothers and sisters alongside them.
– Anvay Ullal, Photographer
The most powerful moment of the rally for me was when high school and college students started creating a human wall along Trousdale: children of undocumented immigrants were linking arms with members of the LGBTQ+ community, with Asian American students, with African American students and with USC administrators. I felt inspired seeing so many different groups of people united against hatred, and it was comforting to know there is sweeping support for marginalized groups. Their message was clear: “We will not give up, we will keep fighting for our rights, and we are here to stay.”
-Ellice Wang, Photographer
“I have attended many protests in the last eight or so years, coming from Wisconsin, a state full of political unrest over its governor. This was, however, my first time experiencing it from behind the lens. To me, it was much more powerful this way, and I definitely shed a few tears during the two-hour march. I was actively looking into the souls of those protesting as I deliberated whose expressions and signs to capture.”
-Emily Smith, Photographer
“I never thought of myself as a photojournalist. I didn’t think that I would be the photographer at the scene as it was unfolding. And I didn’t think much of it as I was running around campus into the early hours of Nov. 9. All I knew was that I was enjoying my profession to the fullest extent. It wasn’t until I went to bed that night that I realized I had captured an event that would go down in history.”
