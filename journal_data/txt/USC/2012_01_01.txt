The Trojans fell on the road to Stanford, 51-43, on a night where their two leading scorers, sophomore guard Maurice Jones and junior forward Aaron Fuller, struggled mightily.
Jones was held scoreless in the first half and finished the game with five points on 1-12 shooting.
Fuller did not record a shot attempt in the opening half and ended the night with five points and four fouls.
USC’s two freshman guards, Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley, assumed the scoring load. Moore made his first four shots of the game on his way to a team-high 12 points and four assists. Wesley had nine points and three steals.
“Being 15 games in, we have worked out the kinks,” Moore said. “There is no more time for the excuses that we are young. We have had to grow up a lot.”
USC (5-10, 0-2) jumped out to a 10-2 lead, silencing the crowd at Maples Pavilion that featured few students because of winter break. After making four of its first six shots, however, USC only made six of 17 shots the rest of the half and went into halftime trailing 31-25.
The Trojans cut Stanford’s (12-2, 2-0) lead to three late in the second half, but Cardinal guard Aaron Bright scored five consecutive points to put the game out of reach.
“We can play a bunch of midgets to a one-possession game, or the New York Knicks,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We are just not winning games or finishing games because of our youth.”
USC is coming off of a 53-49 loss to California on Thursday.
“I cannot be more proud of the way that guys have played up here in terms of effort, rebounding, and defense,” O’Neill said. “I am shocked that a team as young as ours is as good as it is defensively.”
The Trojans next play Arizona State at home Thursday. The Sun Devils (4-9) are coming off a 68-51 loss at Arizona.

USC defeated Cal 74-54 at the Galen Center on Saturday, marking the largest victory over Cal since 2005.
New Year’s Eve marked several firsts for the Women of Troy: the first conference victory for the USC Trojans and junior forward Christina Marinacci’s career-high 23 points.
Following the loss to Stanford on Thursday, USC aimed to improve its rebounding and second-chance opportunities.
“Rebounding is our biggest key,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We lost the rebounding war tonight by four, but, then again, sometimes things work in different ways for you.”
Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts led the Women of Troy with nine rebounds. Briana Gilbreath posted eight rebounds and Christina Marinacci added seven, combining for a total of 40 for USC.
“If you can compete against these top rebounding teams like Cal, who is the number three rebounding team, it gives you a chance to win,” Cooper said.
Harberts and Marinacci posted 23 points each against the Golden Bears.
“[Harberts and Marinacci] have a unique ability about them because they are very mobile,” Cooper said. “They have to carry the load for us. It’s always a team effort that they have to shoulder the majority of that down post-ugly play — rebounding, banging, and getting us some points on the offensive end.”
Senior guard Ashley Corral was 4-for-4 with 3-pointers giving the Trojans an early lead in the first half. Corral finished with 13 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds.
“I think the one thing that we have on our side is that we are a very good executing team,” Cooper said. “When we execute, move the ball around and stop taking quick shots, it enables us to not only score the basket but also get offensive rebounds.”
Now 1-1 in Pac-12 conference play, USC hopes to continue its momentum as it will face tough competition on the road. “With those two teams, Arizona State being a very big team and Arizona, we’re going to have to execute well on offense and play good defense,” Cooper said.
USC will travel to Arizona next week to face Arizona State and Arizona. The Women of Troy will first visit Tempe to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. and will take on the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday at 1 p.m.
