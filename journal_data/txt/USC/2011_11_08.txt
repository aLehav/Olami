As the USC admissions staff concludes its international recruitment period and shoots for another high enrollment of international students next year, programs geared toward international students are expanding.
The International Language Exchange program, which matches foreign students with native-speaking English students to improve both students’ secondary language skills, has increased its participation by 82 percent since it began in fall 2010.
“It was difficult to recruit USC volunteers [last year],” said Katie FitzSimmons, a lecturer at the USC Language Academy and the creator of the International Language Exchange Program. “It was easy to recruit international students, but harder to find the USC students to match them with.”
FitzSimmons attributed the program’s growth to the use of the USC Housing listserve to advertise.
The program aims to help American students become multilingual, while offering international students a “window into a different culture,” according to Kate O’Connor, the director of the USC Language Academy, which runs the program.
“The objective is that international students interface closely with USC students to practice English and their home language,” O’Connor said. “Ideally both students will learn from the experience.”
After native speakers and language learners are matched, students are free to choose their learning environment.
“They can go to the gym together and speak the language, they can see a movie together and talk about it in the language, they can do homework together or meet for coffee or eat lunch and speak the language,” FitzSimmons said. “It’s kind of a structured or guided hangout, you might say. There’s a point or a purpose to the hanging out, but you can use the language as context.”
Jackie Kim, a participant in the program and a senior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures, said she felt comfortable speaking Arabic with her native speaker partner.
“It’s nice to have someone who you can just talk to, you know, on a one-on-one basis,” Kim said. “You can ask them anything you want. It’s not like there’s a line between teacher and student.”
Kim said speaking with her partner has really helped strengthen her skills.
“Learning the colloquial version of Arabic … is just very valuable, especially because I’m gonna be abroad next semester and I won’t be able to learn certain phrases and slang words in my classes,” Kim said.
Amy Herrmann, a senior majoring in international relations, said the program makes learning Arabic seem less like work.
“The program is usually supposed to be one hour speaking English and one hour speaking the language that you’re looking to practice,” Herrmann said. “But me and my partner, Nasser, we end up spending about four or five hours together every week, just sitting and chatting about a whole bunch of different things.”
With each incoming class, USC has increased its percentage of international students, said Megan Wang, an associate director of USC admissions.
“Fifteen percent of the current freshman class is international students,” Wang said. “This is one of the biggest values we’ve had in years. We hope to maintain this percentage.
With more and more students coming from overseas, O’Connor said bridging the gap between foreign and domestic students will help both groups of students in the future.
“Domestic students will sink or swim in today’s global market based on their multicultural understanding and capabilities,” she said. “By developing these capabilities, they will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.”
FitzSimmons said the program forges unique connections.
“This program really fosters the idea of working together toward the common goal of learning,” FitzSimmons said. “It’s also about knowing that you have more in common than you think you do — that you’re more alike than you are different.”

USC students looking to make a difference need look no further than David Hernandez, a junior majoring in political science and American studies and ethnicity, who won the Champions of Change: Winning the Future Across America Award last year and got the chance to present his proposal to President Barack Obama.

Obama announced Nov. 2 the White House will begin accepting applications for the 2012 Champions of Change.
Hernandez was one of the 12 recipients of the award, a White House initiative to recognize Americans attempting to stimulate the creation of high-qualified jobs. Hernandez’s proposal suggested increased education advocacy for immigrants.
Hernandez traveled to Washington, D.C. in September to present his award-winning proposal on how to better prepare minorities for college to the president.
“The Champion of Change Award recognizes everyday Americans of all ages for providing solutions and [implementing] changes in the community,” Hernandez said. “I felt honored to stand up there representing USC.”
Hernandez, an immigrant from Mexico, has always had a strong interest in immigrant rights. Hernandez attended a private high school and attended Santa Monica College before transferring to USC, but when he saw the poor reading and writing skills of his fellow classmates he was stunned at the educational disparities.
Hernandez was also influenced by his father’s strong work ethic.
“When I saw him doing manual labor, I felt choked up,” Hernandez said. “I saw how hard he was working to support me and my family. I realized I needed to make the most of my opportunities.”
Hernandez never thought he could attend USC until his entrepreneurship professor at Santa Monica College encouraged him to apply. The professor told Hernandez about his own story as an immigrant, and walked Hernandez through the application process. His professor’s advice inspired Hernandez to help educate minorities on the college process.
“My professor sat down with me for two and a half hours to look over my application,” Hernandez said. “This is when I realized how important it is for high school students to be informed about the college application process, including all the funding opportunities.”
During his first year at USC, Hernandez became an active member in USC Chicanos for Progressive Education, a program that sends undergraduates to overcrowded and underfunded high schools in South Los Angeles to mentor and inform students about the college application process.
“It’s nice to see someone from the same background as you because it really helps establish a connection,” Hernandez said. “It’s like showing them if I can do it, you can do it too.”
George Sanchez, professor of American studies and ethnicity and history, said the help Hernandez is providing local high school students is admirable.
“[Hernandez] has a real compassion for thinking about a whole range of issues, in his thinking through immigration issues, and how they relate to his own situation,” Sanchez said. “He is also a first generation college student who is trying to make the most of his opportunities.  David cares deeply about the incorporation of everyone into American society.”
The article never once talks about Hernandez only helping minority students.  It says he helps students from underfunded and overcrowded inner-city schools.  Are these kids overwhelmingly Hispanic and Black?  Yes.  But his program is hardly racist.  It is simply addressing the needs of kids who go to underfunded and overcrowded inner-city schools, no matter what color they are.  Hernandez, and the program he is involved in, assigns mentors to such students.  Oftentimes these students are fatherless, and the student-teacher ratio is too high for them to have much one-on-one time with their teachers.  Hernandez and his colleagues act as mentors, helping them get through high school and apply to colleges.  Helping them make the most of the opportunities available to them and maximizing their potential.  
In doing so, they are, in theory, helping to raise the number and caliber of applicants to this country’s institutions of higher learning.  More competition in admissions = more competition in undergrad classes = more competition in the job market.  Competition is a good thing.  An economist would tell you that increased competition in any market (that would include the job market) increases productive and allocative efficiency.  What Hernandez and his colleagues are doing is tapping into a previously-untapped pool of academic talent in the inner-city.  And he’s doing it with nothing but his own time, at no expense to the rest of us.  That can only be a good thing in the long term, as it will lead to an America with more diverse, creative, productive, and efficient workers and less unskilled workers that conservatives like you guys like to complain about as being “drains on the system.”  An America with more net tax payers and less net benefit receivers.  An America that can better compete on the world stage.
How is a program that, if successful, will ultimately benefit the entire country at little to no cost to society racist?  More importantly, why wouldn’t everyone be strongly in favor of such a program?
Seriously, if you are a non-ethnic person i.e. WASP spewing your white-guilt, bleeding heart liberal, crusader rhetoric…don’t bother. The day I graduated from SC, which was only 2 years ago, I read this long article discussing the fallacies of the college experience. Most colleges across the U.S. advocate for activism and liberal/progressive agendas. But ironically, this “Robin Hood” crusader thing is bull. It’s nothing but a facade for privileged white college students to patronize ethnic students, but black and Chicano students per se. 
Identity politics is perpetual whining. Institutional racism exists if you don’t blend in with your career environment; don’t like it? then quit your job, and do your own thing. Ain’t nobody putting you under duress to be there. If they crack insensitive jokes or say things you don’t like, either put your foot down, or leave. Remember, if you don’t like the rules, then don’t engage. 
USC’s academic prestige and competitiveness is attributed to the international students who pursue STEM field majors, not a bunch of schmoes who do these cheesy “McDegree” BAs. “International student” and “disenfranchised minority” student are two different things. And the former raises the bar academically, and the grading curves. 
By the way, nice textbook style, rubber stamp write up. I took a few bullshyt identity politics classes too.
Nothing sadder than seeing the privileged SC alum lose his bladder at the sight of seeing accomplishments done by the “oooooooootttheeerrr”. 
Seriously, I know you’re afraid and the fact that a non-white low income minority is getting recognition and accolades for something that was previously only alotted for rich people (who coincidentally most of the time tend to be “white”), but there’s nothing to be afraid of. No one is going to go to your home and force you to pay reparations and we are not intentionally trying to hurt your ego because you do have a very deep sense of wrong because you know you’re apart of the problem. You’re so deep in the privileged closet you’re finding Christmas presents.
His mission is not based on skin color, its based on helping immigrants get into higher education. Few people realize how diverse our country is in terms of immigrants. ONe of the things Mr. Hernandez points out is that immigrants have poor reading and writing skills because it is hard to learn English as a second language. So assuming it is based on skin color is wrong, it’s about helping people get the proper education.
As to the comment about identity politics, there IS institutional racism everywhere, whether you want to admit it or not. And there IS fault within the system. But the comment misses the point of the article. Is it about getting immigrants help with education? YES. Is Mr. Hernadez’s plan about playing identity politics? NO. It’s about educating people and helping people who need the extra push, just like students with learning disabilities, just think of this one as learning English and frequently coming from underfunded schools.
Great, let’s increase the identity politics classes here at SC. Let’s become activists and constantly find fault with “the system.” There’s institutional racism everywhere, yup.
“Hey, I graduated from SC Mr. Interviewer, now give me that job!…(mr. interviewer)But your degree is worthless. What marketability does a identity politics degree bestow?…None, it’s all about SC-connections, right?. …(interviewer) I’ll call you if uhhh…there’s something there. By the way, don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”
Is his mission based primarily on Skin Color?
I thought that was what racists are all about?

Undergraduate Student Government weighed in on the debate over creating a smoke-free campus Tuesday night by passing a senate resolution calling for the enforcement of designated smoking areas and a clarification of current smoking policy.
The administration will take an official position on changing smoking policy on the University Park Campus once it has heard from the different constituencies for faculty, staff, undergraduate students and graduate students, according to USG Director of Campus Affairs Jared Ginsburg. The other three constituencies’ representatives have passed resolutions, which are used to formally communicate interests to administration.
Residential Senator Marissa Roy, a co-author of the resolution, sees the legislation as an intermediate step toward possibly establishing a smoke-free campus in the future.
“We may be in the direction of becoming a smoke-free campus one day,” Roy said. “[Clarifying designated] smoking areas will be a first step to gauge reaction and get students used to the idea of seeing smoking limited on campus.”
Nearly 65 percent of 1,485 respondents to a USG online poll supported limiting smoking on campus, according to the resolution. A plurality of about 46 percent of the respondents favored a smoking ban and 40 percent favored a change in the university’s smoking policy that includes clarifying the location of designated smoking areas.
“I support a campus-wide ban on smoking contingent upon USC actually enforcing it,” Matthew Prusak, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business) said. “Smoking poses a health risk and it seems like the right thing to do from a health standpoint.”
USG Senate Speaker Pro Tempore Vinnie Prasad, who cast the only dissenting vote, said the resolution does not address the plurality’s views.
“While I agree with the spirit that we need to clarify all rules, I think we should have considered the 46 percent,” Prasad said.
USG had initially planned to vote on the resolution last week but tabled the legislation to settle confusion between two groups of senators — those who wanted administration to take action and those who wanted to clarify the current policy, Roy said.
The new draft added clauses aimed at clarifying and publicizing current USC smoking policy along with asking the administration to take action.
“Students don’t know what the policy is,” Ginsburg said. “They just don’t understand it. We are calling for a very clear announcement by the administration as to what the policy is and where the university falls on the issue.”
The USC Academic Senate and the USC Staff Assembly, the representative bodies of faculty and staff respectively, passed resolutions in 2010 advocating for a smoke-free campus. The academic senate’s resolution cited research findings and recommendations from the Provost’s Work and Family Life Committee, which conducted focus groups on both campuses.
“It’s not out of the realm of the really possible,” said Christopher Chomyn, a senior lecturer in the School of Cinematic Arts and the committee’s chair. “We are not leading this trend. We are way behind the curve for universities adopting smoke-free policies.”
At least 586 colleges have adopted smoke-free campus policies as of Oct. 7, including schools with large campuses such as the University of Michigan and Oregon State University, according to the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation.
In September, the Graduate and Professional School Senate expressed its opposition to a smoking ban with a strongly worded resolution that called smoking bans “an encroachment of personal rights.”
“The lack of enforceability was a big problem we talked about,” GPSS President Ryan Estes said. “We thought there could be a lot of alternatives to create a healthier campus than a flat-out smoking ban.”
Chomyn, however, said a ban probably wouldn’t be heavily enforced.
“It’s not meant to be punitive,” he said. “It’s meant to improve the general welfare of our community.”
Because of the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoking, some smokers support the enforcement of designated smoking areas despite the inconvenience they cause.
“I’m a smoker, but I agree with the designated smoking areas,” said Jin Yong-Moon, a junior majoring in music industry. “I may harm other people if I smoke in open areas.”
Chomyn said his committee’s research showed opposition to a ban mostly comes from non-smokers, rather than smokers.
“Most of the people who are smokers seem to be in the favor of it, or at least open to it,” he said. “The push back has been from non-smokers.”
Roy also said she hopes the resolution’s urge to clarify policy will mean students learn there are already designated smoking areas on campus.
“Students in the survey were asking for something that already exists, but they didn’t know were already there,” Roy said.
In the coming months, USG will continue to work on expressing the student body’s opinion regarding USC’s smoking policy.
“USG is going to be the stalwart voice of students,” Roy said. “We want to keep our personal views out of it.”
The resolution will remain effective for two senate terms, taking advantage of a new bylaw amendment that allows each senator to submit one strongly supported resolution to the subsequent senate.

Gilbreath nominated for CLASS Award
USC All-American senior guard Briana Gilbreath has already received plenty of accolades for the work she does on the court. Now she’s being recognized for what she does in the classroom and community, too.
Gilbreath has been nominated as one of 30 candidates for Lowe’s Senior Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School Award.
The award honors a senior with notable achievements in four areas of excellence — community, classroom, character and competition, according to the award’s website
Gilbreath boasts a 3.11 GPA and was selected to the Pac-10 All-Academic second team for the 2010-2011 season, according to a press release.
The Texas native has volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, Dribble for a Cure, Relay for Life and many other community organizations in her time at USC.
Gilbreath also serves as vice president of Fresh Faith, a Christian student organization she helped found that provides outreach, fellowship and events on campus.
Last season the senior captain became the first member of the women’s basketball team to be named an Associated Press All-American since 1997. Gilbreath was selected as an honorable mention.
The two-time All-Pac-10 selection became the 22nd player in program history to eclipse 1,000 career points while leading USC in scoring, rebounding, steals and blocks as a junior.
In January, a national media committee will select 10 finalists from the list of 30 candidates.
Those 10 players will be voted on by fans, coaches and media to determine the recipient of the award, which will be announced at the NCAA Women’s Final Four in April.

Barkley nominated for Wuerffel award
Just one day after being named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week — the third such honor this year and fourth of his career — junior quarterback Matt Barkley was named a finalist for the 2011 Wuerffel Award, given to the player who best combines exemplary community service with outstanding athletic and academic achievement.
The award, presented by the All Sports Association of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., was first awarded in 2005 and is named after Danny Wuerffel, a former Heisman Trophy winner who led Florida to the 1996 national championship.
After a six-year NFL career, Wuerffel was praised for his community service and humanitarianism across the country.
Wuerffel expressed his satisfaction with the list of finalists.
“Once again, I’m amazed at the quality of character and accomplishments we have in our finalists,” Wuerffel said in a statement.  “These young men have succeeded both on and off the field in extraordinary ways.  It’s going to be a tough process for the selection committee to pick a winner.”
For Barkley, the announcement serves as just another in a list of awards he is included on.  The junior signal-caller has lead USC into a three-way tie atop the Pac-12 South standings and has enjoyed his finest season since arriving on campus in 2009.
This season Barkley has put up career highs across the board.  His 28 touchdown passes through nine games already rank as 17th on the Pac-12 single-season list, and last Friday he broke his own USC record with six touchdown passes against Colorado.
These stellar numbers and inspiring leadership have earned him the honor of being one of the semifinalists for both the Maxwell Award, given to the nation’s best player, and the Davey O’Brien Award, given to the nation’s best quarterback.
A starter since his freshman year, he currently ranks fourth on USC’s career completions list and total offense list.
In 33 starts, he has thrown at least one touchdown pass in 29 games and has thrown for at least 200 yards in 22 career games.

Disciple: a person who is a pupil or an adherent of the doctrines of another; a follower.
For Pete Carroll, passing on the keys to his winning ways wasn’t going very well in fall 2008.
Carroll’s most prominent pupil, Lane Kiffin, had just been fired by late Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis following a 5-15 head coaching stint that spanned less than 21 months. Davis went as far as to call Kiffin a “flat-out liar” who “brought disgrace to the organization.”
Ed Orgeron, Carroll’s assistant coach during USC’s run to the 2004 national championship, was fired from his first head coaching job by Ole Miss in November 2007. Orgeron failed to win more than four games in a season in his three years in Oxford and coached the Rebels to a 3-21 record in SEC play.
Nick Holt, who coached USC’s linebackers during Carroll’s first three seasons in Los Angeles, returned to the Trojans after a 5-18 spell as head coach of the Idaho Vandals.
Sure, the silver fox was having success on the field at USC, living up to his favorite catchphrases of “Always Compete” and “Win Forever.” His Trojans were in the midst of an 11-1, Pac-10 championship season that culminated in a 38-24 Rose Bowl defeat of Penn State. Back then, BCS bowls were the norm and the word “sanctions” didn’t figure into every discussion.
Still, head coaches are judged in part by their ability to pass lessons on to their assistants. Look at any successful coach, whether he works in the professional or college ranks, and you will likely see a group of his former assistants that went on to have noteworthy head coaching tenures of their own.
Case in point: Five current NFL head coaches (the Patriots’ Bill Belichick, the Saints’ Sean Payton, the Giants’ Tom Coughlin, the Chiefs’ Todd Haley and the Dolphins’ Tony Sparano) were one-time assistants to two-time Super Bowl winner Bill Parcells.
As evidenced by the coaching matchup in this Saturday’s USC vs. Washington tilt, times have improved for Carroll’s band of disciples.
Following one season at Tennessee, Kiffin took over for Carroll at USC and has done an admirable job of guiding the sanction-strapped Trojans to a 14-7 record in his first year and a half at the helm.
Orgeron reunited with Kiffin at Tennessee and has regained his position of assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator for the Trojans.
On the other sideline, Huskies head man Steve Sarkisian spent seven seasons on Carroll’s USC staff, including two years as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator.
When Sarkisian left for Seattle, he took Holt with him, putting him in charge of the Huskies’ defense.
The two turned around a Washington program reeling from an 0-12 season in 2008 into a 6-3 team this year that hasn’t lost to an opponent outside the nation’s top 11 teams.
Last year Sarkisian and Holt led the Huskies to a Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska, the team’s first bowl game appearance since 2002.
Trojan fans haven’t been celebrating with their former allies though: Washington has upset USC on last-second field goals in each of the last two seasons.
Holt added some spice to the burgeoning rivalry this week, when he told reporters following the Huskies’ 34-17 loss to Oregon that his defense would “be OK against [USC]. I’d rather play against USC than Oregon quite honestly.”
Posters with Holt’s statement appeared in Heritage Hall on Monday, although Kiffin and Sarkisian both downplayed the significance of Holt’s comments.
Whatever becomes of their rivalry, Sarkisian and Kiffin now lead two of the top five teams in the Pac-12 conference and both seem set for long-term success at their respective schools.
Meanwhile, a stone’s throw from Sarkisian’s office at Washington, Carroll is experiencing a sophomore slump in his second season as Seattle Seahawks head coach. His team is 2-6 and five games out of the division lead and it’s only the beginning of November.
Former USC assistants Pat Ruel, Rocky Seto, Ken Norton Jr., Carl Smith and Kris Richard have joined forces with their old leader in the NFL but Carroll hasn’t yet had the type of success that made him a Trojan legend.
There’s no doubt that what Carroll did during his nine years at USC was extraordinary. He orchestrated one of the greatest runs in college football history: seven straight Pac-10 titles, two national championships and a .814 winning percentage from 2001 to 2009.
But maybe he could gain insight from the way Sarkisian and Holt turned around the Washington program. Perhaps he could take a page out of Kiffin and Orgeron’s cool demeanors in the face of intense scrutiny.
Surely, one of the benefits of raising up successful followers is to learn from their triumphs too.

USC coach Lane Kiffin and Washington coach Steve Sarkisian are not the only ones garnering attention heading into Saturday’s game between the No. 18 Trojans and Huskies. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley, as with Kiffin and Sarkisian, has been examined more than usual after breaking the school record for most touchdown passes in a single game with six at Colorado.
Precision · Through nine games this season, junior quarterback Matt Barkley has thrown 28 touchdowns compared to a mere six interceptions. - Luciana Nunez | Daily Trojan
 
With three games remaining for USC, there has been much discussion about the possibility of Barkley leaving for the NFL draft next April. Barkley insists, however, his top priority is finishing the year on a high note.
“I want to finish this season out with a bang so that decision is an easy decision,” Barkley said. “We still have three games left and come December I’ll have a lot of time to think about it.”
In his last four games against California, Notre Dame, Stanford and Colorado — three of them being on the road — Barkley has thrown for 14 touchdowns and only two interceptions. USC’s offense also seems to be clicking at the right time in both the running game and passing game, averaging almost 38 points per game over that four-game span.
“[Barkley] has been playing the same all year,” Kiffin said. “Now these pieces around him are coming into place and are being more consistent; that’s why we are seeing the better numbers.”
Though Barkley’s strong play has furthered the Trojans’ recent offensive success as of late, he is not receiving much consideration for the Heisman Trophy award. Kiffin is not surprised by the play of his signal caller in recent weeks and his progress as a player has not gone unnoticed by the coaching staff.
“He’s continuing to develop and is playing at a high level,” Kiffin said. “I have said before that he would be in the Heisman race if there were things that [weren’t] out of his control.”

Though Barkley tossed six touchdown passes Friday, he believes that some improvements can be made.
“I think it is just timing with our wide-outs,” Barkley said. “It’s kind of hard because they don’t always go full speed out here [at practice].”
Barkley’s top target, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods has been suffering from an ankle injury this season. Barkley connected with Woods for two touchdown passes Friday against Colorado.
The timing between Barkley and freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee seems to be all right as well after the first-year wideout notched his first two-touchdown game of the season against Colorado. It was his seventh touchdown in his last seven games.

With Sarkisian on the opposite sideline Saturday, many USC players not only are familiar with the former coach, but his coaching style.
“They are a physical team with a similar defensive style to what we play here at USC,” Barkley said. “Most importantly, we have to stick to our game plan and play Trojan football.”
Last year, the Trojans lost to the Huskies on a last-minute field goal.
Two years ago it was the same situation. A late-minute field goal by kicker Eric Folk did USC in. Washington has won the last two meetings, and the players understand the importance of Saturday’s game.
“We’re looking forward to it and we’re seeking revenge in this game,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “It was heartbreaking for us, but we’re looking to come back harder.”
All of the players, however, are not entirely focused on the revenge factor.
“Nothing last year, will help us win this year,” Barkley said. “We’re a completely different team than we were last year and none of that sour taste is still in my mouth.”
—
With an extra day of practice this week, USC seeks to maintain its momentum from its recent play.
“Getting that extra preparation in and extra hours means a lot to us,” Robey said. “It’s mainly about keeping our mind clear and having the team staying focused, having everyone coming out and playing the hardest they can.”
Junior safety Jawanza Starling, redshirt freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, freshman tailback George Farmer, senior tailback Marc Tyler, redshirt freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard, Lee and Woods were all limited in practice.
Senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris and senior offensive tackle Martin Coleman did not practice.
Lets Go Trojans.. Its time to put these guys away. Put Sark and Holt back in their place and send them home.
We got the talent and the depth this year.. crack these fools hard and take this game Trojans.. Fight On !!

The headliner of last season’s USC men’s basketball team was former forward Nikola Vucevic — the 16th overall draft pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers.
Missing presence · Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson (pictured here on Feb. 12 against Oregon at Galen Center) will be counted on to replace last year’s Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Simmons, who graduated last May. - Daily Trojan file photo
Vucevic was a first team All-Pac-10 selection and his 19.4 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in conference play placed him second and first, respectively, in the Pac-10.
It goes without saying: USC will be challenged to replace the Montenegro native.
Losing its top scorer is, no doubt, a blow to an offense that was anemic at times last season, finishing ninth in the Pac-10 in scoring offense at 65.3 points per game.
To its credit, however, USC’s low scoring totals were a byproduct of its game plan, as the team regularly rotated only about seven players through its lineup, hoping to slow down the pace of games, so as to not exhaust its players.
With the potential for more depth this season, especially at the forward position, the Trojans might be able to play a more up-tempo game.
“We’re a lot faster than last year as a group,” sophomore forward Garrett Jackson said. “[Former center Alex Stepheson] and [Vucevic] were both great players, but they’re more bangers inside. We have big guys this year who run the floor really well, so we’ll be able to move the ball a lot more and trap a lot more on defense and be more aggressive.”
Jackson is one of only two returning players who registered a field goal last season, with sophomore guard Maurice Jones as the other.
Though he averaged only 12.5 minutes per game in Pac-10 play last season, Jackson flashed a smooth perimeter shot in his sporadic playing time, shooting 56 percent from the field and 45 percent from beyond the arc.
“When [senior guard Jio Fontan] was healthy, I thought of myself as more of a spot-up guy because he and [Jones] are such great drivers,” Jackson said. But now I’m going to have to be more versatile and play multiple positions, whereas if he was still here, I’d be strictly a [small forward].”
A key player who will be teaming up with Jackson in the front court this season is junior forward Aaron Fuller. After sitting out a season following his transfer from Iowa, the left-hander will be expected to contribute scoring from the mid-range area, as well as a tough interior paint presence.
During the 2009-2010 season, Fuller was named All-Big Ten honorable mention, averaging 9.7 points and a team-leading 6.2 rebounds in 30 games.
“I want to try to get a lot of rebounds and try to execute on offense, give the offense some scoring,” Fuller said. “I’m going to be aggressive and crash the boards hard, which we’re all trying to do, and make plays when they’re there.”
In addition to replacing Vucevic, USC must find a way to compensate for the graduation of forward Marcus Simmons — the 2010 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. Despite his offensive limitations, Simmons was often called upon to guard the opposing team’s best scorer, helping USC finish first in the Pac-10 in scoring defense, surrendering only 63.3 points per game.
During a Feb. 24 game against then-No. 10 Arizona at Galen Center, a 65-57 upset win for the Trojans, Simmons, by in large, kept future No. 2 overall NBA draft pick Derrick Williams off the scoreboard. When guarding Williams, Simmons held the forward, who was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves, to just eight points on 3-for-11 shooting.
“It’s going to be a team effort,” Fuller said. “We all have to pick up the slack. We have the guys to do that if we focus and play hard. We have some people who are going to be hard to match up against.”
Before the season, sophomore forwards Curtis Washington and Evan Smith were expected to contribute to this team effort. Unfortunately, Washington tore his left labrum during USC’s practice for the Brazilian exhibition tour and will miss the season as a result.
Smith, after sitting out last season because of a left shoulder injury, was hopeful he could see his role increase in 2011-2012 as a scoring option off the bench. But a re-aggravation of the same shoulder injury means he will be out an additional 5-7 weeks.
USC, as a result, might opt to use “big” and “small” lineups.
If it wanted to field a bigger team, it could insert junior James Blasczyk at center along with sophomore Dewayne Dedmon at either power or small forward.
Conversely, USC could utilize a small starting five by playing any of a number of guards such as freshman Byron Wesley at the small forward position.
Regardless of the players on the court, it is clear that Jackson, as the one USC forward holdover, among others, will be counted on to lead the forward unit.
“I’m going to have to [be more of a leader],” Jackson said. “I’m going to have to cut down on mistakes. [Jones] and I are going to have to step up in that leadership role and be more vocal.”

For a band who’s never played with Over The Rhine before, The Milk Carton Kids already have a history with the Ohio-based husband-and-wife duo.
Two guitars, two voices · The Milk Carton Kids, native Angelenos, have been stunning new listeners with their simplistic folk sound and style. The band will be playing a show with Over The Rhine on Nov. 13. - Photo courtesy of Crash Avenue
“We were on our way to a show and listening to Over The Rhine in the car,” said Joey Ryan, one half of 2011’s folk sensation The Milk Carton Kids. “We became fans very quickly — after that we decided it would be really cool to do a show with them.”
Kenneth Pattengale, the second face of The Milk Carton Kids, emailed Over The Rhine guitarist, pianist and bassist Linford Detweiler to tell him how much he admired his work, and the two began writing to each other.
Five months later, Ryan and Pattengale are getting ready to open for Over The Rhine at El Rey Theatre, marking the beginning of a weeklong west coast tour.
“This is our first opportunity to play in Los Angeles for an audience this big,” Ryan said. “We know they’ll be a great audience. It’ll be a real honor to open the show.”
The El Rey show also represents fulfillment of a more personal kind — Pattengale and Ryan are native Angelenos; Ryan attended UC Berkeley, and Pattengale, a USC alumnus, graduated with a degree in history and a minor certificate in critical studies in 2006.
“Every time we play in [Los Angeles] it feels like a homecoming show,” Pattengale said. “The crowds here have been very kind to us.”
It’s a modest statement for a band that has already sold out Santa Monica’s famed McCabe’s twice this year. Yet, the ability of Pattengale and Ryan to connect with their fans has remained steady as they continue their rapid ascent into fame.
The two also manage to make folk music appealing to those who normally reject the genre, and do so while giving away their music for free — saying it’s their live shows, not their CD sales, that mean the most.
“The records are an extremely great point of pride for us, but there’s something more, something more pure and different you get from a live performance every time,” Ryan said.
Remarkably, The Milk Carton Kids’ casual approach to album revenues hasn’t colored the business side of their live performances. They are, sincerely, not in it for the money.
“Pay for the show,” Pattengale said. “Come in, say hello to us, enjoy the night and then download the music for free. There’s something extra special about that.”
It’s The Milk Carton Kids’ passion for performing that has made their concerts so beloved in Los Angeles. The pair knows people are seeing them at their best.
“We have always hung our hats on the strength of our live shows,” Pattengale said. “Our first release was a live album, and we don’t put anything on the albums outside of what people see live anyway.”
For as much attention as Pattengale and Ryan have garnered in recent months, The Milk Carton Kids are a relatively recent creation. The two have known each other nearly two years, but it wasn’t until February that they began writing and playing as the folk duo we know today.
“The albums we were working on before we met each other were full of different instruments and sounds and effects,” Ryan said. “Then we met and started doing simpler things, just two guitars and two voices. Eventually we just decided we needed a name for it all.”
‘Two Guitars and Two Voices’ has become the duo’s signature of sorts, referring to their bare, stripped-down style of writing and recording. The band’s albums Retrospect, released in March, and Prologue, released in July, convey an unassuming openness between artist and listener. In Prologue tracks such as “Michigan” and “There By Your Side,” their voices, at once husky over two guitars, make you understand their widespread appeal.
The successful duo isn’t reluctant about staying together and shows no signs of separation. The Milk Carton Kids will at least stay together for a little bit.
“One more month,” said Ryan immediately.
Pattengale gravely added, “At least.”
They held for a moment, then yielded to fits of laughter before soberly outlining plans for festival performances, film score writing and even the possibility of a third album drop in the coming year.
“We’ve both indefinitely shelved our solo careers,” Ryan said. “Neither of us has plans to stop. There are other things we want to do, film scoring, all that, but for now it’s this. We work really well together.”
The Milk Carton Kids will open for Over The Rhine at El Rey Theatre on Nov. 13 at 8 p.m.
Uh, no mention of Joe Henry being the go-between for Pattengale and Detweiler? Odd ommission considering that’s the obvious connection. Nice “letters to a young poet” story though.

The image of the typical gamer has been something of a caricature: a rambunctious teenage male mashing buttons with his friends or a post-college mama’s boy cooped up in his parents’ basement.
Most of us acknowledge these stereotypes as funny exaggerations, but the crux of their humor lies in a key assumption — gamers are still portrayed as fundamentally male.
This hackneyed association has created somewhat of a difficult journey for the female-gamer minority, which isn’t nearly as much of a minority as it used to be.
According to an annual study by the Entertainment Software Association titled “Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry,” the number of female gamers has increased dramatically in the last several years and continues to rise. In 2007, female gamers accounted for approximately 38 percent of the total gaming population. This year that number rose to 42 percent.
Many video game companies continue to find women’s increasing presence in the gaming market startling.
But with such an overpowering female presence, why does this stereotype of the average gamer as your run-of-the-mill male youth still persist? Why is it so hard for the industry and the public to accept the idea of women as active participants rather than just observers?
Unfortunately, it’s not just the game manufacturers that have failed to acknowledge women’s presence. Fellow male gamers continue to criticize female gamers, particularly in the more traditionally “male” gaming environments, such as the war-torn worlds in Call of Duty. Through online gaming, many women have faced gender discrimination, verbal abuse and sexual objectification. On Fan Girl: The Blog, a website dedicated to providing fan girls with a haven to talk about nerdy or traditionally male hobbies, guest blogger Racheal Ambrose discusses her own experience with male online gamers and their assumptions that girls simply don’t like or play games. Several comments on message boards also emphasize how gender-based bias has led some female gamers to opt for more androgynous screen names and avatars to avoid becoming targets of criticism and unwanted sexual attention.
The basic accusations of female inferiority and inexperience stem from the fact that male gamers once made up a much larger fraction of the gaming population and are struggling to accept the evanescence of their position as alpha gamers.
But this attitude might also fall back on a more legitimate reason than just one based on petty egoism. The majority of female gamers are considered casual gamers rather than hardcore, primarily because of women’s active consumption of smart phone and tablet games.
But a July study conducted by Doritos found female gamers enjoyed playing video games more than sex, shopping, working out and taking baths. This study proves that most female gamers, despite their prevalent status as casual gamers, consider video games a significant part of their daily lives and aren’t casual enough to be regarded as a noncommittal group of consumers. Female gamers can create as prosperous a market as male gamers if given the proper platform.
There’s really only one solution to this ongoing neglect of women in the gaming world. Because the industry cannot continue to snub the vast female presence anymore, it should, instead, capitalize on its female followers by targeting them with their marketing efforts.
Fortunately, many companies are already doing just that. In Japan, for example, developers are eager to make money off the nation’s growing female market by producing a greater variety of female-oriented games. One such type of game is the otome, or Japanese romance, which is geared toward female gamers through its amorous storylines.
But not all female gamers are interested in the stereotypically feminine romances. The video game industry is thus responding to this stereotype by creating video games that can appeal to women and men. In Autumn Games’ upcoming 2-D fighter game Skullgirls, several of the female characters are impressively detailed in their combative skills and abilities, which distinguish them from the testosterone-targeted, big-breasted damsels of previous games.
The less overt sexualization of female characters in recent and upcoming video games showcases the gaming industry’s desire to appeal to a diverse female audience rather than just a male one.
Women still have a few more barriers to break down, but the increasing number of female gamers and the gradual changes in the types of games being produced provide hope for the industry’s eventual move away from a male-centered mindset. By developing more female-targeted games and fostering a more welcoming community for female gamers, the gaming market will grow financially and socially.

What is not being mentioned here, though, is that women are playing mainly social and casual games–although they rank gameplay higher than most activities, the fact of the matter is that they are not dominating the hardcore or even the middlecore games. Communities in those scenes are still extremely male-dominated, and while some circles are tolerant and accepting of female gamers, the majority that are not are simply overwhelming.
While it’s nice to see an increase in female gamers, unfortunately it’s in a scene that’s always been friendly to women, a scene that caters to women. Several game devs refer to their target group as CHOs–chiefs of households. These games are being designed, developed for, and marketed to women. They want to draw in women to the social and casual games. 
But not the hardcore or middlecore games.
 Hardcore and middlecore games are still extremely unfriendly grounds for women, as are their hypersexualized portrayals of female characters–as far as acceptance goes, we’ve still got a very, very long and rocky road ahead.

Achieving a lifestyle of both town and country is a long-desired American dream, a representation of versatility and success. There is a magazine dedicated to it and even a type of car named for it. The Churchill, West Hollywood’s latest trendy restaurant, is L.A. dining’s contribution to the town and country ideal.
But The Churchill doesn’t accomplish this goal.
Lacking heart · The Churchill’s menu features a stark contrast between delectable standouts and pathetic flops. Among the letdowns is the artichoke (above) with bottarga, a depressing dish that lacks appealing taste. - Bernard Leed | Daily Trojan
Décor plays a major, interactive part in The Churchill experience. Menus are placemats, and a photo booth greets you at the top of the staircase on the second floor. Ball jars serve as water glasses, candle votives, vases and hot tea mugs — the latter maybe not the smartest idea. And though they aren’t used, old-time cash registers add some intrigue to the bar areas.
If it all sounds schlocky, it kind of is. Yet it’s doubtful this is the restaurant The Churchill aims to be; the menu suggests an effort for sophistication.
Charcuterie plates, whole rockfish, bouillabaisse — it’s all on the menu here and all for diners who don’t mind doing a little work once their orders arrive. On paper, this menu embodies the town-country combination well.
An appetizer of duck confit impresses. Duck is on menus all over the city, but here it’s cooked well and butternut squash hash lends the dish a unique twist. The skin of the bird can be crispier, but this shortcoming is an easily forgettable offense when breaking up a bite of duck meat with a sweet burst of roasted grape. And with these heavier flavors, it works well as a smaller dish.
Another appetizer, the artichoke with bottarga, arrives as one of the restaurant’s sadder looking dishes — just a few strips of heart with bread crumbs and drizzled lemon aioli. The flavor of the bottarga, which would have been appealing for its slightly fishy taste, is unidentifiable. This artichoke is nothing special.
The Churchill also has a selection of specialty pizzas. One topped with pork belly and ricotta is especially appealing, but the additional toppings, including pine nuts and some charred mixed greens, contribute to an entirely chewy bite, augmented by an undercooked crust. The flavors are all there, and the greens add a welcome bitterness, but the joy of a pizza is as much about texture of components as it is about flavors.
A diverse array of ingredients is better represented in The Churchill’s halibut and bouillabaisse. The halibut arrives generously portioned with a golden cornmeal crust and large, waving flakes. It looks pretty, particularly sitting in the burnt-orange broth of the soup. And the soup, fortunately, includes dainty shellfish, and it tastes like the saffron one hopes for in a delectable bouillabaisse.
The gnocchi with braised rabbit, however, is a complete failure. The rabbit, presented in flavorless strips, would be better incorporated in the tomato sauce. Unless it acquires a juiciness or spice — anything really to provide it with some flavor — the rabbit’s inclusion seems unnecessary.
And if you’re content to push the strips of rabbit meat aside and focus on the gnocchi, well, bad news for you, too. The gnocchi is baby-food soft, as soft as the sheep’s milk ricotta with which it is served.
Dessert is just as hit-or-miss as the rest of the menu.
Chocolate panna cotta is every bit as rich and thick as one would hope, the fork getting tense as it slices into the mound, while the fig tart is less impressive. The fresh figs, the balsamic drizzle with notes of caramel, and the olive oil ice cream, which melts as it melts from the pastry’s center to each corner of the dough, are all signs of a clever, capable kitchen. Why, then, must the crust, the largest element of every bite, contribute so little? The dessert, above all, should be about the tart.
Town, country, sophisticated, fun, trendy, classic — The Churchill wants to be too many things for too many people. The restaurant would be wise to take one or two contrasts, stick to them, and focus on the execution of its food.
Herein lies the restaurant’s greatest flaw: It has commitment issues. If you’re going to serve rabbit, differentiate it from other meats. If you’re going to char a bit of artichoke or pizza crust, make sure the whole thing is crispy. At least that way, if the dishes still don’t work, they’d actually stand for something.
The Churchill could be a worthwhile restaurant, but it has some big decisions to make.

The old, familiar saying “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure” rings true at a current exhibit called “Trash,” on display at the gallery Hold Up Art in Little Tokyo.
Electrifying · Alex Chiu is among the artists featured at “Trash,” on exhibit at Hold Up Art. At first glance, his pieces, such as “Lightening Bolt Eyes,” look simplistic, but upon further inspection, viewers will notice they’re rendered on wood. - Photo courtesy of Gorgeous PR
The idea behind the exhibition is one bred from an economically savvy and eco-friendly standpoint. To save money and help the environment, the nine artists featured in “Trash” have made works from gleaned materials, creating a show of multimedia works as well as straightforward paintings that use wood panels instead of expensive canvases as their backdrops.
Hold Up Art’s commitment to making art more accessible makes it the perfect spot for “Trash,” a show focused on discovering new wallet-friendly ways of creating art. The show is guest curated by Matthew Hodges, an exhibiting artist at Hold Up Art who handpicked eight of his favorite artists for the exhibition.
Hodges, who renders images of humans and animals with a child-like simplicity, is also one of the main artists featured in the exhibition. Hodges’ outlines of human figures are painted over haphazard newspaper ads. Though his pieces don’t necessarily encompass one main idea, they all seem to hold a certain playful quality: “Batman” is a reimagining of the famous superhero in a feathery suit, and “4 Loko” portrays humor with its mocking title, as it’s merely a rendering of three people and a nebulous dog.
Cody Lusby’s work is also highlighted in the exhibition. The painter, who goes by the codename “Mustachio,” describes himself as a mixture between modest and bold, his codename representing his more outgoing alter ego. True to his fake name, a tell-tale mustache is hidden in the artist’s pieces, which are already speckled with paint and torn-out images.
In the spirit of the exhibition, Lusby uses collaged materials and street-style stencil art in his artistic images, and the combination is truly something to behold: His images are both exuberantly cluttered and gracefully painted.
Though Lusby’s work has veered between the fantastical and the realistic, his pieces depict images of homelessness; and though “Norman Could Sleep Anywhere” and “The Beggar” sound like they might be an attempt to portray a grittier side of Los Angeles, they are in the same radiant style as his most vivid paintings.
Common threads connect Danny Schutt’s pieces throughout the exhibit in the most unexpected ways. Using history as a clear inspiration, Schutt’s works vary from depicting Soviet Union figures to woodsy Americana imagery. His pieces range from simple transfers of daguerreotype portraits (photographs taken by early cameras, employing iodine-sensitized silvered plates and mercury vapor) onto pieces of wood, to painted antlers, to an image of a moose placed over the pages of an encyclopedia. Though Schutt uses many different mediums, his artwork is easily recognized by its brazen hunting imagery.
“Trash” is about the reuse of discarded items, but many of the pieces don’t immediately appear to be made out of a coffee table or a chair. The pieces of art appear to be just that — pieces of art — and their transition from “chair” to “painting” is seamless.
Alex Chiu’s “Laser Eyes,” for example, is, at first glance, a painting that could be done on a simple piece of canvas. The piece is set apart in its useful repurposing of an old piece of wood.
Kilby Redell’s “Bass” plays up the concept of found items, taking an old bass and painting it with a colorful clown design. Craig “Skibs” Barker’s multimedia boxes show glimpses of painted lady’s legs, placed next to wire netting and little treasures the artist might have fittingly found from trash.
Though artists have long been repurposing found materials and incorporating them into collages and multimedia pieces, “Trash” celebrates the concept as something not only fun but beneficial — for the wallets of artists and for the environment.
“Why spend money on new canvas when you can reclaim a surface for free?” Hodge argues.
When even the production of these materials is harmful to the environment, his attitude seems fitting. “Trash” offers a proposal: Found objects need not simply be used to decorate art, but to reinvent how we think of the very objects we use to create art.
“Trash” will be running until Dec. 1 at Hold Up Art gallery.

Ticketing at excessive level
Enough, that was the only word I could think of when I saw LAPD police officers last week ticketing students for biking violations.
This is at least the third time this year I have seen dozens of bikers ticketed at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue.
How does punishing students hurrying to and from class do anything to make us safer or reduce violent crime and robberies?
The number of times these incidents have occurred and the sheer volume of tickets being handed out shows that this policy is not intended to teach lessons about bike safety and is instead a revenue raiser for the city.
Students should not be taken advantage of to help  bail out a city government that is in financial trouble because of its own irresponsible budgeting decisions.

The issue of labor exploitation has been on my mind lately — for some reason, everywhere I look, the struggles of employees are flashing before me, and I cannot help but bring attention to these issues.
In Seattle, on Nov. 7, 60 farm workers were bussed to Stemilt Grower’s Apple Orchard, the nation’s largest supplier of cherries and tree fruits. After getting off the bus they were told they’d be making $25 for five hours worth of labor. When the workers refused to work, they were stranded.
But these issues seem so distant and abstract. They don’t affect us, right?
The reality is, infringement of workers rights is happening on the University Park  campus. Employees are losing hours and health care benefits.
The USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, which works to create a socially responsible university and monitor labor exploitation on campus, will host a worker meet and greet on Thursday in the University Religious Center fishbowl from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. so students can hear directly from the employees.
According to SCALE’s Facebook event, “[USC’s] attempts at resolving worker issues and sharing their grievances with administration have been largely ignored.”
The Keck strikes took the lime light for a while at the University Park and Health Science campuses.
Workers at Keck School of Medicine strikers expressed grievances because they were losing retirement benefits.
They were also striking against  ongoing contract negotiations and inadequate input in matters regarding staffing and delivery of goods.
Because the workers are represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers, their concerns were facilitated into a 24-hour strike. Perhaps USC isn’t as wholesome as it is seems to be.
This week, another labor issue at the University Park campus has arisen.
According to SCALE, employees at the on-campus food places we love — Parkside Restaurant, Seeds Marketplace and Trojan Grounds — have been losing working hours and health care benefits.
The university needs to be more transparent about labor issues. USC should intervene in the SCALE meeting on Thursday, and provide their perspective and justification of why benefits are being taken away from employees. I am shocked at the lack of intervention on behalf of the administration.
As a student body, we deserve to know why employees’ hours are being cut, and why on earth health care benefits are being sacrificed.
The discussion of prominent labor issues on campus should be university-wide. USC so often strives to stress this “Trojan Family” yet their actions prove otherwise by not providing explanations for their treatment against the employees.
If it weren’t for SCALE, it’s doubtful the employees from on-campus food venues would have other means in which to address their issues and frustration with USC.
There were only minimal updates about the USC Keck School of Medicine strike from the university.
Moreover, if it weren’t for word of mouth, I wouldn’t have known there were more labor issues on the University Park Campus.
We interact with these employees daily — if the university doesn’t maintain transparency, then it is saying as an entity, this institution does not see labor issues as one of importance.
The employees here deserve to have direct responses from administration about their concerns.
Perhaps it is time for USC to reevaluate the principles behind this so-called “family,” and maintain the utmost transparency in issues of such importance
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English. 
At a time when the nation’s economy is softening, and perhaps worse, many organizations are considering layoffs as a way to cut costs.  But eliminating jobs does not always result in immediate cost-savings. There are often severance packages to finance and unemployment benefits to cover.  In addition, the morale of the employees left behind always suffers.
Thanks so much for writing this article. I’ve had several workers talk about how they’re glad to see there’s student support surrounding these issues. I think what it comes down to is treating these workers like human beings, and giving them the respect that they deserve. By their contract, hospitality workers are guaranteed 32 hours of work a week, but many are nowhere near this number. People can’t survive on the few number of hours they’re given. Many food venues are severely understaffed. In many places, people are being worked so hard that they’re being injured because they’re running from place to place while carrying heavy trays and whatnot. Yes, Curt, this is all about the money. USC is cutting back on everything, from worker hours, to health benefits, to the quality of food and the safety of the food that’s being served in the dining halls. Managers are making workers bring out poisonous cleaning supplies, which they’re not legally allowed to use because they’re not trained to do so, while food is still being prepared despite possible contamination, in order to speed up the closing process. I can’t imagine that  USC “needs” this money badly enough to risk the health of its students.
You are babbling nonsense, Julia.   You are talking about people who have jobs, are working, and are getting paid for exactly what they do.  Food service is not supposed to be a lifelong career unless you are a master chef or sommelier or something like that.  Carrying trays and hurrying are both part of the job.  And “poisonous cleaning supplies?”  Yeah, most of the cans of stuff under your sink are poisonous.  But you don’t need training on how to use Windex.  As for their hours, it’s an unfortunate reality that the university has to cut back.  It has happened all over the university.  Everyone has dealt with it and so will the folks from Hospitality.
Maybe the Administration does not think labor relations should be put up for a vote to the students. I must say, I agree with them.
The university is not obligated to provide retirement benefits for every single worker they employ–this would be financial suicide. Take a look at the way the governement runs things where employess can retire with 90% of their full pay, after 25 or so years of working. Boy, where’s that money coming from? It isn’t -we don’t have it . 
Above all, USC must act responsibly in order to protect and to expand the interests of the university, its students, and it’s community–and from my perspective they are quite generous.
This is what happens when the country is running gigantic deficits and is printing money to pay for all of the spending  and debasing the currency which makes it more expensive to employ people and this is the inevitable result.  This is what happens when you don’t want to cut anything.  They should cut military spending and all the corporate subsidies and so on, they dont have to touch anything that people really depend on like SS and Medicare.

To borrow a (slightly modified) phrase from the library of overused sayings: Troy was not built in a day.
The endeavor of raising a building does not come without resistance from the forces of gravity, entropy and human error. Therefore, students should consider construction on campus as an improvement rather than an annoyance.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
This creation becomes a tug-of-war between those who struggle to see it erected and the innumerable things that can go wrong.
Walking around campus, examples of this struggle can easily be seen. The newest construction project of the USC Catholic Center exemplifies this struggle.
Tremors are felt all around campus and off-campus housing as the growls of jackhammers and heavy machinery spill out from behind the fences.
Sidewalks are invaded, and the noise from construction reverberates all the way to Cardinal Gardens and Century apartments, often waking students early in the morning.
Complaints about construction from students are rife at USC.
Construction can interrupt sleep, it can lengthen walks to class and can blemish sceneries. These catastrophes aside, however, the noises are there for a reason.
The change is good. This university is ever-growing, seeking to improve itself, and these ubiquitous construction projects are a major part of that.
We have to live with them, just like past students did, so the university can continue improving the aesthetic qualities of USC, and the good of the next generation of students.
The pervasive construction on and near campus is a sign of positive change and expansion. It shows we have the resources to keep growing and to improve upon what we already have.
All the beautiful buildings on campus were once annoying construction sites — a recent example, of course, being the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Just more than a year ago it seemed little more than cause for extra noise and extra walking.
Back then it was hard to picture it as anything more than another inconvenient construction site.
Now fully functional, it has only served to beautify campus and has been well worth the wait.
To get beautiful buildings that also serve an important function, we must bear that inconvenience.
There is no way around it. Some students wish these kinds of major constructions would be confined to times of the year when there aren’t classes or students to disrupt.
Construction takes time. The last thing that the university wants to do is to disrupt classes, but administrators also know the disruptions that occur can be outweighed by the end product if it is delivered successfully.
In the end, construction is something of a shared experience among generations of USC students.
The amount of construction might vary from year to year, but the students who came before us had to live around the construction of all the buildings we use today, just as students who come to USC many years after we have left it will use buildings that we now know only as inconveniences.
Yes, it might be difficult to think of the school around us in such a decade-spanning, organic way.
We usually only consider the university based on how things are immediately affecting us, but the truth is, these buildings will remain long after we leave.
We might need to walk around an extra building to get to class, or get woken up in the morning, but understanding what the construction is for and seeing how beautiful the results can be, can make that walk or lack of sleep a little less frustrating.

Legendary coach Joe Paterno might be fired in the coming weeks, according to The New York Times. This is the latest news in the Penn State scandal that unfolded this weekend over the alleged sexual assault of boys by former defensive coach Jerry Sandusky.
Sandusky is accused of sexually assaulting, on university grounds, young boys whom he cared for as part of his Second Mile mentoring program. Though Paterno has been cleared of any legal wrongdoing, many have expressed outrage at what they perceive as a failing on the head coach’s part to address what he knew about Sandusky.
The Times spoke to two top university sources briefed on discussions between the university’s board of trustees, who say officials have begun to plan Paterno’s exit. Paterno’s press conference Tuesday was canceled an hour before it was scheduled.
“”We’re always going to be Penn State,” Paterno said when greeted by people outside his house. “I’m proud of you. I’ve always been proud of you. Beat Nebraska.”
In 2002, a graduate assistant coach said he witnessed Sandusky in the team’s showers sexually assaulting a boy, who is described as aged 11 to 13. The assistant told Paterno what he saw, and the coach reported the incident to Athletic Director Tim Curley
From there, law officials charging Curley and other administrative official Gary Schultz say neither official alerted police — as they are required to do under state mandatory reporting laws.
Both Curley and Schultz are facing charges of perjury and failing to alert authorities about the event.
In total, there are eight boys who have come forward alleging that Sandusky sexually assaulted them over his 15 years at Penn State. Sandusky has continued to maintain his innocence.

You might know Donald Glover from the TV series Community, but now you have the opportunity to know him on a whole new level. With the release of his hip-hop alias Childish Gambino’s first major record approaching rapidly, the actor/rapper has taken it upon himself to start promotion in a big way.
It all started with the release of Heartbeat on Saturday. The track boasts a catchy, danceable beat over heavy bass and startling lyrics. Its quite a diversion from the Childish Gambino we know. The production has lifted to new heights on Camp, the rapper’s new album.
This performer is growing better and better with each release. Tracks like “Heartbeat” and the gospel-influenced “Outside” show the rapper’s range and ability to diversify his sound, while keeping a constant recognizable flow.
Childish Gambino has been on the promo circuit to generate some buzz for his new record. The album, Camp, was also performed in its entirety on Halloween — the first major PR stunt for the record. But now, Glover is taken his performances to the national scale. He took to Late Night With Jimmy Fallon to perform “Bonfire” to outrageous approval. Hearing his records is one thing, but Glover proved on the talk show that he is a performer at heart.
The album is available in its entirety for streaming on NPR. And at about an hour long, make sure you have no interruptions when you go to play it. This is a record you want to experience from start to finish without any interference.
I’m glad he’s gotten to the point where people don’t have to say “the guy from community” all the time. Now people can just say Childish Gambino, Mother F**** and people know what you’re talking about! haha anyway, this guy is freakin brilliant and i can’t wait to hear the full album next week!

NASA announced earlier today that approximately 201,700 miles away from Earth, the 1,300-hundred-foot wide asteroid known as 2005 YU55 will pass Earth at 6:28 p.m. EST.
At just more than 200,000 miles away, this is the closest an object of that size has gotten to Earth in the last 35 years. Fortunately, NASA is confident the asteroid will not collide with Earth.
“The frequencies of these occurrences happen on huge geological time scales, but there is no guarantee that it wont happen in the next 20 to 30 years,” said Kevin Yates of the Near Earth Objects Information Center.
2005 YU55 is a C-type asteroid, meaning it is rich in carbon-based molecules and is of the same variety to frequently collide with Earth early in its history. Thanks to new infrared- sensing technology, sensing telescopes have been able to narrow the known number of asteroids that pass near Earth.
If 2005 YU55 did happen to be on a collision course with Earth, NASA says it would hypothetically wipe out a country and leave a crater 1,700 feet deep and 4 miles wide. If the asteroid were to hit water, a Tsunami wave 70 feet tall and spreading over 60 miles from the center would occur.
Young astronomers are excited about this close encounter, as it gives them a chance to analyze the information gathered from this fly-by. The next close encounter will come in 2028, when the asteroid 2001 WN5 will pass 143,000 miles away from Earth.

No matter who wins next November, we’re not going to elect the first African-American president. Given the depth of our current recession, the election is going to be important for a very different reason. There hasn’t been a president since [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan who’s faced such immense economic challenges. Whoever wins the election will have to lead the [United States] and the world as we shift from a mostly industrial to a technological society. The last time the U.S. economy underwent such a dramatic transition is when we went from an agriculturally-based economy to an industrial one.
– Dan Schnur, Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics
I’m trying to pay really close attention so I can be well-informed next November. I feel like at the moment it’s too early to take any of the candidates seriously … within the next few months the serious candidates will come out of the woodwork, I think we’ll get to hear from [Mitt] Romney who I think is Obama’s only serious competition, but it should be an interesting scenario.
– Miguel Contreras, senior majoring in civil engineering
Obama is still well liked but the Republicans have a good shot because of this economy. They just have to get the right candidate to run against him.
– Jack Ostler, senior majoring in geology and economics
I’d like to see more of a commitment to educational support, whether it’s Pell grants or libraries. Some of the top schools, like Princeton, have enacted a no-loans policy … I’d like to see more policies that enforce that. If they’re going to do some trading of favors, I’d like to see it go toward education rather than some of the other things they spend taxpayer money on.
– Adam Sexton, Library manager at Doheny Memorial Library
I don’t feel very good about the elections. The only person I’ve actually heard a bit about is Cain, and between the ridiculous ‘blame yourself’ quotes and sexual harassment allegations, he doesn’t seem very appealing. I guess it’s going to be four more years for Obama, and I’m alright with that.
– Aruna Uppal, graduate student studying education
What Obama is trying to do is put out a house fire with a squirt gun. Give the man some resources.
– Spencer Di Dio, senior majoring in economics
The biggest problem I see is the lack of bipartisan cooperation … within the Republican primary it’s going to be Romney in the front row; everyone else seems to be self-destructive. … It depends what happens in the Congressional and Senate elections. Obama has begun to alienate some of his core supporters by moving toward the center. Clinton was able to do that, Obama not so much.
– Stanley Rosen, professor of political science
I’d like to see a reform on border policy — that’s been delegated a lot at the state level but it’s a national threat. I’ve lost my faith in Obama at the beginning of his term, but at certain points there were events which have regained my faith in him.  … I think he’s the best qualified candidate we have right now.
– Mayir Adato, senior majoring in business administration
I just don’t think any of [the candidates] is strong enough. Even Obama is not strong enough, but neither is the alternative. Obama has a stronger financial base. Right now Republican nominees appear to me very weak … but, you know, Obama is really unpopular now. His approval rating is about as low as any president’s has ever been.
– Victoria Xie, senior majoring in history and economics
Was at a symposium yeaterday sponsored by Leadership Long Beach.  The guest speakers came from the school district, UC & Cal State systems, business leaders, etc…. the main theme was the sytematic destruction of America through the progressive lioberal political agenda… to spend money we don’t have; to keep America’s poor, poor, therefore, slaves to the Federal government by being totally dependent upon government entitlement programs to survive.
The end result is, if you don’t like what’s going on, take a look in the mirror.  You voted for the liberal agenda, thinking it would do some good for the average American.  Now you know it doesn’t.  It makes life worse for America…..
