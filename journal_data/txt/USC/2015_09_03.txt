Two Marshall School of Business graduates are working to make decision-making easier and more efficient through their app Swayy.
Andrew Abramson and Andrew Costa met in their first year in the Marshall’s MBA program in 2013. In the fall of 2014, they began creating their app  which helps users make difficult choices through instant feedback from friends.
The team is finalizing modifications to the app and is hoping to launch on the App Store next week.
The idea for Swayy was set in motion when Abramson’s fiancé could not decide what to wear to dinner. Abramson thought this concept would be a unique idea for an app and pitched it the following day at a competition for an entrepreneurship class.
With high regard and enthusiasm for his idea, Abramson, CEO of Swayy, quickly partnered with close friend Costa, the cofounder of the app.
“We are targeting the high school, college and post-grad people who are on social media and who want to have that social validation amongst their friends,” Costa said. “They also understand the technology, which is very important.”
With Swayy, users can send a visual poll between two choices, whether it is a fashion or fantasy football question, to a select group of friends.
The app then automatically creates a group chat among those who are on Swayy and friends can vote on what choice the individual should make and defend their opinion.
The user is able to set a certain time frame based on how quickly the response is needed. The person in need of answers is able to choose photos from his or her camera roll or use photos from the Internet, as the app is integrated with Google.
Abramson said the two developers received a lot of responses to what their app should be like when they were making it.
“Something that was really challenging was trying to identify what feedback to listen to versus what feedback to be more tone deaf to,” Abramson said. “At the end of the day, you have to do what you think is right and stick to your vision, which I think we did a really good job of. But we also make a really big effort to look at our data that we collect and use that data to inform our product decisions.”
Abramson explained that when they originally conceptualized the idea for the app, they believed women would mainly be attracted to Swayy due to their many fashion questions.
However, over the six month course of their beta testing, it was proven that men frequently use this app for professional sports team results, fantasy sports teams and movie suggestions.
“While I think there is a lot of application for girls in the fashion and food related vertical, guys were using it almost more creatively to come up with more comparisons,” Abramson said.
Aside from Abramson and Costa, Omie Ismail joined the project as the coder and Sachin Medhekar and Rishi Mody, both UCLA alumni, became part of the team as the developers. They went through all of the feedback from the beta testing and made the necessary adjustments, helping the app grow from its early stages to the final product.
USC students have different opinions about the successful use of Swayy.
Margaret Martin, a computer science graduate student, said she doesn’t think she would download the app.
“I personally wouldn’t use it, but I know a lot of women who would for the clothing input reason,” Martin said.  “I just think that people should be able to make their own decisions about simple things.”
Sara Doyle, a sophomore majoring in communication and psychology, said she might use the app to pick which restaurant to go to.
“I would definitely use this app to decide where to eat out with my friends,” Doyle said. “My friends and I are always spending so much time trying to decide where to go and this would definitely cut down on the time we spend debating where to eat.”

The School of Social Work held the inaugural meeting of the USC chapter of the National Association of Social Workers Thursday in the Social Work Center. NASW is the largest organization of professional social workers in the world.
The launch was attended by students, faculty and professionals alike. For Carrie Lew, assistant dean of professional development at the School of Social Work, NASW will help create a positive impact on our community as students will have opportunities to collaborate with professionals in the field.
“It’s great because as one of the largest schools of social work, I’m sure there’s a lot of impact that we could have,” she said.
This enthusiasm was shared by the students such as John Howard, a second-year master of social work student. Howard said NASW has a lot of potential to help students on campus.
“I think it’s going to be great as far as individual student education and professional networking in the field,” Howard said. “The information [and education] that’s being passed is tangible. It seems we wouldn’t necessarily get it unless we were here, [talking] professional to professional.”
As a newly inaugurated chapter, NASW-USC needs students to take the lead. Howard said he wants to run for an electoral board position.
“I’m actually interested in running for president — that’s how interesting it is for me,” Howard said. “I see a lot of exciting opportunities to write grants and work with community around USC as far as the children and veterans. So I see a lot of big things coming out of this organization.”
Shantel Vachani, a senior lecturer who teaches policy courses at the School of Social Work and the organizer of the inaugural meeting, emphasized the relevance of the organization as a resource to students.
“I think it’s really important to get future social workers and professionals involved in this professional organization,” she said. “Bringing it [to] the campus instead of going out to community gives the opportunity for professionals and students to bridge the gap so that when [students] do graduate and get into the community, they are already entrenched in the profession.”
Vachani invited Jorge Diaz,  director and program manager of mental health and substance abuse for Bienestar, a nonprofit social service organization committed to serving the undocumented Latino and LGBTQ communities in Southern California, to speak about future workshops, professional collaborations and internships.
“USC has opened the doors to talk about the work that we do in the community,” Diaz said. “It’s great that this school allowed us to talk about real issues that impact the Latino undocumented community.”
He said that having interns from USC was a great start and it would be much easier to get students now that USC has a NASW unit.
“I think that the next step is to see how we really bridge students and the work that you all do [with] the work that we do,” Diaz said.
The NASW-USC unit aims to engage more students in the field of social work. Diaz said the jobs can be very influential.
“All you have to do is dream and believe that one person can make a difference,” Diaz said. “It sounds very cliché but that one person could be in this room.”

The multi-faceted world of music is now, more than ever, in an era of experimental genres and artists. Within the past years, indie rock has made an amazing leap into the world of mainstream music. Santa Fe-based band Beirut has once again shown how folk rock can inspire with their upcoming album No No No set to drop Sept. 11.
Famous for their mellow but fantastical tune “Santa Fe,” the band has come back swinging with a record full of inspired sounds. According to lead man Zach Condon, the album was inspired by a series of ups and downs in his life, leading to a new perspective on his music.
Condon said that he was inspired by an emotional year and a difficult divorce, through which he experienced an array of feelings and troubles. After having a breakdown in Australia, he went through a period of mourning and healing through a new relationship. Condon said he also struggled with extensive writer’s block, creating and scrapping many songs before reaching the final product that is the much-awaited fourth album No No No. These experiences have culminated in a final product full of honest emotion and an innovative take on the band’s classic style.
The album’s leading track, “No No No,” is a mixture of upbeat piano and dynamic synthesizers backing up lead vocals. With lyrics like “Don’t know the first thing about who you are / My heart is waiting, taken in from the start / If we don’t go now, we won’t get very far,” the song paints a picture of confused and tentative love, a topic of relevance and inspiration to any listener.
Behind the brass instruments and cheery piano, the band really plays with the melodies and harmonies, especially on songs like “Gibraltar” that feature claps, shakers and a diversity of sonic light. As Condon sings, “Everything should be fine / You’ll find things tend to stand in line / It’s but a link in time / But I’m sure you’ll let me try,” his lyrics are punctuated by the rhythmic accompaniment. One particular song on the record, “Perth” is a direct nod to Condon’s healing process in Australia during the production of the album.
Each one of the songs is organic, a product of a singularly definitive point in the artist’s life. The instrument, lyrics and vocals are all exhilarating and haunting. Condon’s eerie and smoky voice still hasn’t changed and carries the album through its vibrant melodies.
Despite the heavy influence behind the new album, the band continues to make light of their success. Their punchy melodies and cheery personalities make for one brilliant combination of gravity and excitement.
So far, the new record has been critically well-received. Performances like the one on Late Night with Seth Meyers have tested the new album on their expected audiences with positive results. The record is even rated a full five stars for pre-order on iTunes. Commercially, the band has also posted their first two official music videos on YouTube. “No No No” and “Gibraltar” both have almost 2 million views in just two weeks.
The new album demonstrates the change of inspiration through new sounds and movements by the band. Experimentation with instruments and Beirut’s signature vintage sound lead to an array of tracks perfect for any occasion. This album could mark not only a significant personal success for the band, but also a gateway for its reinvention within the popular scene. No matter what the struggles the band has experienced in the past year, Beirut has come back kicking. With a vibrant, revamped and new sound as well as a plethora of inspired lyrics, the band has shown that four years off the music scene does not deter them. A musical reinvention has never looked as good as Beirut’s highly anticipated No No No.

We all read books for a variety of reasons, whether it be for pleasure, work or self-help. Sometimes, books pass through our hands and leave little impression on our memories. Other times we read something that sticks with us and, every now and then, changes our worldview completely. I tend to devour books faster than pizza, and though I’m not especially picky about what I eat, I rarely find a book that completely alters my mindset or opinion toward a certain issue. These books have shaped who I am as a person and taught me more than any history lesson.
1. The Grass Is Singing by
Doris Lessing
When I first picked up this book as a junior in high school, I knew very little about South African culture and apartheid. All I knew was that I wanted to read a book from a completely different society in an attempt to broaden my worldview. Lessing’s heartbreaking story not only opened my mind to this culture but also made me more aware of the horrors of this period in history. The novel chronicles the life of a young white woman, Mary Turner, growing up in segregated Rhodesia. After overhearing two women cruelly gossiping about Mary’s single status, her self-confidence plunges and she marries the next man she meets in an act of desperation. This man is Dick Turner, a poverty-stricken farmer. Mary’s new life in their farmhouse is marked by a rapid loss of independence that cripples her. She isolates herself from everyone around her except her black servant Moses, who she treats with contempt and outward racism. But, as her mental state takes a turn for the worse over the years, she comes to rely on and even care for Moses. The book ends hopelessly and tragically but full of Lessing’s beautiful language and sensitivity. There’s no lying that this book is heartbreaking all the way through, but the incredible humanity of the story and bare realities of apartheid make it well worth reading. This book not only taught me about a culture I knew nothing about, but also, more than any other book I’ve ever read, brought home the fact that no person, society or situation is ever black and white.
2. The Grapes of Wrath by
John Steinbeck
I read this book in the summer before my senior year of high school because I thought that bringing it up would sound impressive in a conversation. I must say that I wasn’t particularly excited about the prospect of an 800-page novel about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, and I set about reading it as if it were an assigned novel for English class. By about a quarter of the way through, though, I was hooked. More than that, I realized that this was a book that was going to change my outlook on life and history forever. Steinbeck’s realist focus is on the poor, unremarkable Joad family as they make the pilgrimage from their farm in Oklahoma to California in search of a new life. Before I read this book, I had always been of the opinion that exciting novels about distant places were, by far, the most interesting. Steinbeck taught me that the most incredible beauty and nobility can be found in the banal, in the tragic and in the world directly around us. His style of alternating chapters between the specific story of the Joads’ journey and a grand, bird’s-eye view description of the social and cultural movements happening in America at this time make for an enjoyable read. The writing is exquisite, the characters are real and the story of poverty, loss and hope continues to resonate across cultures and time.
3. We Need To Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver
This is one book I will recommend to everyone I know, regardless of one’s taste in literature. I have never met one person who didn’t praise this novel as one of the most momentous books he or she had ever read. Though, sadly, not nearly enough people have read it at all. While the film adaption starring Tilda Swinton as the distant mother of a mass-murdering teenager garnered some attention for the story, the book remains, in my opinion, infinitely better and much more complex. The story is told by letters from reluctant mother Eva Khatchadourian to her absent husband about their first child, Kevin. Inexplicably, Eva feels no maternal attachment toward Kevin, and secretly thinks he is a deeply disturbed and manipulative child. This lack of motherly love creates a rift between Eva and her husband, Franklin. The situation escalates, all leading up to Kevin murdering several of his classmates in the school gymnasium. Shriver’s psychological analysis leads the reader to question whether Eva’s distant parenting and clear distaste for Kevin affected his development and could even be partially to blame for his deadly actions. This book doesn’t sensationalize, nor does it brim with bloodlust and political posturing. Instead, it turns inward and examines how complex our various relationships are, especially within the family setting. This book made me think about parenthood as well as mental illness in a completely different light, all the while being fascinatingly entertaining.

After long expressing a desire to work behind the camera, actor Chris Evans has finally made his directorial debut. His new movie, Before We Go, in which Evans also plays one of the two lead roles, tells the story of strangers who meet unexpectedly and spend a night together in New York City. Evans’ latest venture echoes the masterful Before trilogy but ultimately fails to find a rhythm between the two characters.
The movie starts with trumpet musician Nick (Evans) playing at Penn Station in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, Brooke (Alice Eve) is frantically running through the station to catch the last train, which she misses anyway. With no money and a broken cell phone, Brooke catches the attention of Nick. Nick offers to assist Brooke in getting home before the morning. Though obstacles keep the duo from doing that, Nick and Brooke end up traveling throughout the city, discovering revelations about the romantic relationships they have with their respective partners and developing a connection with one another.
Aesthetically speaking, the movie’s cinematography is beautiful. Shot in dark, soft tones that bear a slight resemblance to lomography, Before We Go will surely leave audiences content with its visual elements. The photography of the film not only captures the anxiety of the characters but also accentuates the beauty of winter in New York City. The scenes are taken by cinematographer John Gulesarian, who also shot indie drama Like Crazy.
“[Gulsearian] was wonderful, I mean, being a first timer, you don’t necessarily have the technical lingo to express the look you want,” Evans said in a roundtable interview. “You know the flavor you want to taste, you just don’t know the ingredient that goes into it. You can reference it.”
The unspoken third main character in the film, New York City, weasels itself into all the essential plot points and makes an otherwise vacuous movie more complex. During the course of the night, Brooke and Nick travel through discernible landmarks of Manhattan, and it is the elements of the city that push against their ultimate goal.
“The thing that is noticeable to me about New York is that it is actually a city that sleeps between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., where no one is around,” Eve said. “And that’s why Brooke was screwed, she was lost, and so she had to go with [Nick]; she didn’t have any choices.”
Throughout the night, Brooke and Nick demonstrate their budding relationship through banter and hijinks. In one scene, Brooke and Nick crash a party in which they pretend to be part of a band. Brooke sings “My Funny Valentine,” with Nick accompanying on the trumpet. In another scene, Nick calms a nervous Brooke by telling her to use a dilapidated phone booth to pretend to call her younger self and warn her about the future.
Though aspects of the film are charming, it is still disorienting
because even at the best of times, it
is unbelievable how two beautiful people, one from Marvel and one from the Star Trek universe, can be forlorn in romance. The fact that Captain America is playing the trumpet all by himself in the middle of the night is a discrepancy that never goes away. Unfortunately, the script is not strong enough to mask the massive identities Evans and Eve have outside of their franchises. Instead, the movie is reduced to a series of “woe is mine” conversations about relationships. It’s not like in Before Sunrise, where, in a similar situation, the two characters spend a night together but end up realizing more about themselves and how they see the world. Though it’s almost criminal to size up Brooke and Nick’s relationship against Celine and Jesse’s epic connection, Before We Go never seems to get it right with the main characters’ chemistry.
Nevertheless, Evans explained that there was difficulty finding a script to which he connected.
“It’s a matter of finding something that you are passionate about, you connect to, but also something that the producers are willing to let you direct. It’s not like being a first-time director they’re throwing Aaron Sorkin scripts at you,” Evans said. “I can’t tell you how many scripts I read that were sh*t and realize that they’re sh*t because no one’s got to them; that’s why they’re coming to me.”
Ultimately, Evans isn’t quite the next Ben Affleck, Clint Eastwood or any other acclaimed actor-director. He still has a bit to learn about the production process and selecting scripts with more captivating dialogue, but his humble demeanor will help in acquiring a skill set necessary for great movies.
“I’ve absolutely fallen in love with it and the lessons I’ve learned, the tools I’ve picked up, and very eager to tackle the next one,” Evans said. “Who knows how that will evolve.”

In Los Angeles, it’s difficult not to think of the health-conscious dietary sticklers the city’s residents are known to be. From spinning and cycle classes to organic detoxifiers and endless varieties of quinoa recipes, L.A. is as progressive and contemporary when it comes to food and drink as any other city. Perhaps nothing personifies this characteristic of L.A. as much as the juice craze. Wherever you go, it’d be difficult not to find a café, store or even coffee shop that doesn’t offer juice or a juice cleanse. You’d be even more hard-pressed to not have seen or heard of the king of them all — Pressed Juicery.
Founded in 2010 by Hayden Slater, Carly de Castro and Hedi Gores, Pressed leads in offering fresh, gluten-free, vegan, organic and delicious juice in an assortment of flavors and tastes. With younger generations becoming increasingly more focused on what they consume, Pressed is the trademark that embodies and represents a focus on well-being through fostering a healthy lifestyle. Boasting 42 storefronts across California, Las Vegas and New York, Pressed is much more than a product — it’s a company and brand that is as Los Angeles as Pink’s Hot Dog or a Runyon Canyon Instagram post. I had the pleasure of sitting down with co-founder Hayden Slater to talk all things Pressed Juicery.

Q: What’s your personal background and history prior to Pressed Juicery?
A: I was born and raised in L.A. I went to NYU for film school. After I graduated I became involved in film and various production positions. My first job straight out of college was with HBO. Before PJ, I was very much a part of the entertainment industry.
Q: How did Pressed Juicery get started? 
A: Back in 2010, it was really just me, Carly and Hedi with a vision to make this company. We raised our own money and started from scratch. We used the closet in a cupcake shop after-hours to start making our juice. We started small, but were determined to make something of it.
Q: What makes Pressed Juicery so special? What’s unique? How does it differentiate itself from other juice brands? 
A: We really go back to our roots. We use raw ingredients, all natural, organic, gluten free and vegan. What’s on the bottle is in the bottle. We were the first to offer juice shots. We launched an online magazine as well juice freeze, which are vegan, frozen treats. We believe so much in our product [that] I really think it speaks for itself.
Q: Competition, particularly in Los Angeles, is stiff with the juice market. What marketing and branding strategies have you used to continue to make Pressed Juicery stand out?
A: We really faced a lot of imitations in the beginning. A lot of companies would take our idea and create their own. There used to be this conflict, but now I think the competition is healthy. We know what our values are and what we stand for and I think our customers know that and appreciate that.
Q: How do you feel about the long-term prospects of your company? Will people continue to buy into your brand in the future?
A: Again, we believe so much in our product that I think customers will continue to return and grow with us. Our product tells a story and it does all the talking. We offer a healthy way of life and wellbeing, and I think that’s what makes us appealing to our customers. We were actually approached to be entrepreneurs pitching our company on Shark Tank, but we felt it wasn’t the right direction we wanted to go in.
Q: Pressed Juicery offers not only a product, but also a company that fosters a lifestyle. What other markets are you hoping to expand to in the near or far future?
A: We’ve been very fortunate to work with social media influencers who have fell in love with our juice. It’s all been organic, and we’ve been lucky to connect with such a strong market and community of people.
Q: Do you have any hopes of continuing to open storefronts or will your business model focus more on stocking shelves at grocery stores, specialty stores, coffee shops, etc.? Where do you hope to take Pressed next?
A: We’re definitely looking for a blend of both — retail and storefronts. We want health and high nutrition accessible and wherever we are able to do that — be it business-to-business, retail or e-commerce — we want to offer what our customers want. If there was a demand for more retail outlets or even more stores with let’s say food options as well, we’re willing to listen and explore what’s possible and what works. We want the masses to drink this product and for it to be readily available.
Q: What’s your response to criticisms that people can just go to the grocery store, buy fruits and veggies and make their own juice at home? 
A: We welcome it! If you try our product and that inspires you to make your own at home, by all means, do that. We’re promoting a lifestyle and culture that is rooted in organic products and wellbeing. We have 35 to 40 flavors of all natural ingredients to choose from, and we have this vision that we want others to share in. If you want to make your own juice at home, I do have to say though, enjoy the clean up!
Q: What advice do you have for budding entrepreneurs and those who are looking to start their own business like you?
A: Stay true to yourself. Start a true passion. Really believe in yourself. Do what you love. A business is living thing. You should welcome mistakes. There is no right or wrong. Do what’s best for the company.

Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
The first two weeks of school mark a grace period in terms of food options at USC’s three main dining halls. As we delve further into the semester, however, we might begin to grow tired of the selections offered regularly, calling for much-needed creativity on our parts. 
By now, nearly all students have made themselves one of the iconic waffles with the USC stamp or have at least seen photos on Snapchat. A breakfast of champions, this spirited meal inspired me to practice a true Trojan’s courageous trait, so I decided to do a little experimentation and create a one-of-a-kind waffle recipe by integrating one of my all-time favorite beverages, mocha.
While EVK, Parkside and Cafe 84 all have their own waffle makers and the components to experiment with new combinations, I made this recipe with the ingredients from EVK. Considering the coffee machine’s proximity to the waffle maker, you’d think a recipe such as this one was destined to happen.
And so, I present to you my recipe for Mocha Chocolate Chip Waffles:
Step One: Grab a clear plastic cup and fill two-thirds of it with waffle batter from the dispenser.
Step Two: Grab a white mug and fill it with mocha from the coffee machine. In the spirit of experimentation, you may also try any of the other seven options.
Step Three: Take your white mug and pour some of your mocha into the plastic white cup until it is full. Then, grab a spoon and mix the two substances together until they are blended.
Step Four: If you wish to include chocolate chips in the batter — and who wouldn’t? — take a moment during this preparation time to mix them into your clear plastic cup.
Step Five: Once your batter is prepared, pour the contents from your cup into the waffle maker and close the lid. Be sure to follow the instructions on the device in order to properly set the timer.
Step Six: After the timer goes off at two minutes and thirty seconds, open the lid and place your waffle on a plate.
Step Seven: At this point, you can choose to decorate your waffle with anything from fruit to cereal, but for this recipe, I chose to top my creation with whipped cream and even more chocolate chips.
As a lover of both mocha and waffles, I personally found eating this recipe to be a transcendental experience. Much like the introduction of Nutella to crepes, the combination of mocha with waffles is one that should not go unrecognized.

Welcome to Classics’ Corner, a weekly music blog that reviews classic albums from a wide variety of genres. Every week will examine an album considered influential to its genre and generally innovative. Artists profiled will range from Nas to Led Zeppelin. The featured albums’ impact, style and legacy will be explored. The ultimate goal is to spread appreciation for these great pieces of work, and to get USC students interested in or reacquainted with them.
This week, I’ll delve into the world of West Coast gangsta rap by reviewing perhaps its most important and iconic album — Dr. Dre’s The Chronic. Dre’s first solo effort, this album was released by the newly formed Death Row label. Dre had recently had an ugly split with former NWA co-member Eazy-E over contract disagreements. His contributions to NWA as a producer had already established Dre as a critical component in the development of gangsta rap. But with The Chronic, Dre created the sound that would define ’90s West Coast rap — “G-Funk.”
The Chronic is widely regarded as the best-produced album in the history of rap — and for good reason. Dre essentially created a new sub-genre of rap by mixing his adoration of funk music with traditional boom-bap sensibilities, resulting in smooth, lush and intricate beats. The drums and bass — often sampled from songs by funk legend George Clinton — were fat and velvety, contrasting directly with the sparse rhythmic backbone created by traditionalists on the East Coast. And of course, The Chronic introduced Dre’s signature synth sound; his wailing wormhole and saw leads became a staple of West Coast production.
Dre’s innovative production didn’t just change rap’s sonic landscape; it introduced a new attitude, a new approach to the genre. Whereas East Coast — a production ­­most notably that of Wu-Tang’s RZA — reveled in minimalism, Dre’s “G-Funk” oozed excess. Traditional beats were bare and tense; “G-Funk” was the musical embodiment of instant gratification.
The Chronic introduced the world to Snoop Doggy Dogg, a young and skinny Long-Beach native who had a flow as smooth as butter. The album should really be considered a joint effort, since Snoop appears with Dre on almost every track. Snoop’s laid-back delivery meshed well with Dre’s husky and forceful vocals. The two would frequently trade bars, making for some of the best back-and-forth in rap history.
One obvious example is the album’s centerpiece, “Ain’t Nothin’ but a G Thang.” The now-iconic song is gangsta rap’s finest, and is one of the most influential songs to come out of the ’90s. “G Thang” captures perfectly the essence of The Chronic as a whole — it is sometimes fun, sometimes violent, sometimes misogynistic, and always unapologetic. The song featured themes (the pursuit of women, partying, gang-banging, and love for one’s city) that became common in gangsta rap. And the layered, perfectly-mixed instrumental puts Dre’s notorious perfectionism on full display.
Despite “Aint Nothin’ but a G-Thang’s” relaxed lyrical content, one should not dismiss The Chronic as purely a party record. The album is teeming with tension, which didn’t come as a surprise since it was released the same year as the Los Angeles Riots of 1992. In fact, The Chronic serves as a sort of blueprint for the riots. Track four, “The Day The N—-z Took Over” features audio recordings of coverage of the riots that capture the chaos Los Angeles and Compton endured during those five days in spring. But Dre and his crew don’t condemn that chaos. Rather, they relish it. The song essentially encourages looting. The song might seem troubling, but no one can accuse it of being unrealistic.
Dr. Dre (among many others) was often criticized for glorifying gang violence. Dre argued, however, that he wasn’t glorifying gang life — he was merely describing it in its entirety. His assertion is strengthened by the presence of songs like “Lil Ghetto Boy,” which examines the loss of innocence as young black men in Compton turn to gang life. “Things done changed on this side/Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right,” laments Dre. But ultimately, Dre and Snoop continue to be unapologetic about the violence committed in the song’s storyline. The track is by no means anti-gang. Again, it (supposedly) reports a reality.
And so, The Chronic can be seen as a series of battles — battles against the police, battles against the white establishment, and battles within the Compton community. From these battles come misogyny, a deep sense of machismo, an obligation to protect one’s territory, drugs and alcohol, and, of course, violence. These themes, combined with the record’s maximalistic production, make The Chronic an assault on the senses in the best possible way.
With the release of the Straight Outta Compton movie, along with the recent protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Baltimore and elsewhere around the country, The Chronic is as relevant today as it was when it was released. Its production is timeless ­­— hopefully its content isn’t. Either way, revisiting this album always proves to be a rewarding experience.

…..in 1990-1991 @ CLuB GLaM SLaM, as Dr. Dre sat to our left in our drivers seat in one Mercedes Benz 190e he was interjected with the words “F*ck That” and then told “In the FUTURE the way you Sound in the Studio” was to be put into the Mercedes Car Stereo , the Sony Walkman and the Panasonic Car Phone upon the floor of that vehicle. We had listened to Dr. Dre and TOLD him while swiping our left hand as a “Price is Right” hand model across the center console. Dr. Dre’s mouth flung WIDE OPEN and just said “DUHAYMMnnn!!!” as these advents were NEWS to Andre. We shook hands on it and took pictures, and throughout many years of our lifetime we continued to remind Dr. Dre that he was To Do these things, we also utilized Interscope Records 1-800 number divulging to key personnel of what of us was FOR Dr. Dre and how Dr. Dre had been TOLD prior at CLUB GLAM SLAM in 1990-1991. …….
… 1990-1991 @ CLub GLaM SLaM as (Dr. Dre) sat to our left in our car, a BOISTEROUS laugh was shared as Dr. Dre was TOLD as well, “… and charge $2000.00 dollars each for them sh*t’s “, and then we reduced to $1000.00 dollars each, and then we reduced to $800.00 each, and then $500.00. This is the factor that has become referred to as the “Fashion Quality”. “Dr. Dre ” was then TOLD, “…muthaf*ckas is gonna be wearing this sh*t, and don’t even got it plugged into nuffin'”. “In the FUTURE” 2014?, and as SPOKEN into being to Dr. Dre in 1990 – 1991, many walk around and interview wearing our (Musical Flightline Ear Protection) “not plugged in”, nor with requisite power supply, and even “Off”. That a “Social Status” would derive was foreseen, and that “Status” have (Andre) “Dr. Dre”, at it’s basis, by our CHOICE!!!, ….we even made it into the (Benz) “Daimler/Chrysler” , ….and the (Panasonic Car Phone) “H.T.C.”……
1991 however , “Dr. Dre” was a kind and responsive fellow , (deservant). “Dr. Dre” , as invited to sit in our drivers seat made several “divulgeances” , to such we became “empathethic” , as having listened. We “interjected” his speaking with the words “F*ck That” and in “rapid succession” spoke to him several points in which he was to cover (in and for “the FUTURE”) , to which he just said “GoTT-DUHAYMnnnn ! ! . These “points” were bestowed as a “Resolve” because his “divulgeance (s)” , had been us (in divergent form (s). An “AMALGAMATION” occurred , “Dr. Dre” was TOLD our thoughts (ideas) (advents) as we deemed him a good “catylyst and suiter” for them. This all became the greatest secret we ever bore (because we knew what he would be coming with and we maintained it such) This secret we maintained via clandestine communications with Interscope Records via their 1-800 number. …As a child we were given a “Radio Shack” am/fm Headphone Set , ALL FlightLine and Aviation equipment is “etched” for accountability , “IF” personal , your name on it , however “Dr.Dre” , as whom we TOLD , “…the way you Sound in the Studio…? ” , …he was to become “the GUTs” of these advents as well , …”the Mercedes Car Stereo , the Panasonic Car Phone , and the Sony Walkman”, circa 1990-1991 @ CLuB GLaM SLaM ..
George Benson “LOVE X Love” (1st verse) ……thanks (dr. dre) ….thanks buddy. Are you happy with ALL that you were TOLD in 1990 1991 as you sat to our left ? ……the WORLD call you and Jimmy iovene “Geniuses”. …thanks buddy, …thank you (dre). ….(dre) GOT stronger love for wellington cousins….thanks dre ….thanks buddy…..

On Monday, 860 Mission Division Los Angeles Police Department police officers went on duty with the addition of body cameras in an effort to create transparency. The new policy was reviewed and approved in April by a police commission with a 3-1 vote. By allowing police officers to pre-review images from their cameras, the policy undermines its effectiveness — though it should not be a precursor to a policy that uses public funding for these body cameras.
This policy rollout falls in line with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s goal of equipping over 7,000 officers in Los Angeles with body-mounted cameras within the next two years. The recently enacted policy was made possible with more than $1.5 million in private fundraising. But whether or not such gear can effectively invoke a sense of accountability is put into question when the rules which govern the usage of the body cameras are seemingly counterintuitive to its main purpose: increasing public transparency.
Any system that encourages accountability for one’s actions will reap positive benefits. However, separate from the gruesome and despicable acts of certain police officers, I believe in trusting and respecting the police force. That being said, there is nothing wrong with body cameras as long as the funding for the equipment derives solely from private funding and stays away from any federal monetary support.
In December of 2014, the Orange County Register’s Editorial Board brought up an important fact about the usage of federal dollars for the expense of body cameras.
“The Posse Comitatus Act was passed in 1878 precisely to prevent the federal government from intervening in state and local police affairs. We have seen how federal strings have diminished local education and welfare programs. We should not endeavor to add policing to that misguided list,” the editorial board said.
In order to safeguard the rights of citizens in our community, I commend the LAPD for making efforts to keep their officers accountable. There is no doubt that an officer on duty would think twice in terms of deciding what to do in any given situation of altercation, whether physical or verbal. But as the American Civil Liberties Union has pointed out, the rules that enforce the body cameras are lacking simply because the footage is barred from the public unless there is a criminal or civil court proceeding which would then present the necessity to release the information.
Back in April when the initial plan was created, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck explained that the body camera ruling should be considered “slowly and carefully.” In a piece written in April by the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board, the board explained that though the efforts to create accountability were commendable, the rules that enforce the usage of the body cameras are faulty.
“While the proposed rules explain in detail, how and when officers must use the cameras, including outlining the few instances in which the devices can justifiably be switched off, and privacy protections for victims, the document fails to explain the department’s provisions for public access,” the L.A. Times Editorial Board said.
Though this act may transform the way our police force operates and the way in which information can be fairly distributed on the side of both officers and citizens, the policy rules must be altered in order to enact true transparency.
In order to do so, the rules must clearly identify when the body cameras are allowed to justifiably be turned on and off. The discretion of the police officer to manage the body camera must also come with the officer’s full understanding of a case in which the footage would violate the privacy of the citizen involved. Nonetheless, the main focus of the LAPD should be to promptly address the concerns of Angelenos by mending the rules to state that it is a legal violation for the officer to review the footage before it is handed over to investigators. But let me make this clear: It is our duty as citizens to protect the rights of both parties. Creating the space for police officers to testify before they have seen footage from their body cameras allows them to justifiably back up their own claims while also allowing the citizen involved to do so. Body cameras are a good thing if executed in the correct way.

Body cams and dash cams use is two fold. One protects the officer from inaccurate accusations by the phblic. The other protects the public.

The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that four Uber drivers cited at Los Angeles International Airport had serious criminal records. The incident is the latest among a number of other allegations that Uber is unsafe, that its drivers have attacked passengers and that its background check process is not rigorous enough. But at USC, Uber is just as safe as Campus Cruiser and traditional taxi services.
Many students can use Campus Cruiser as an effective alternative to Uber for close distances. Many students, however, prefer Uber over Campus Cruiser because Uber generally picks up students within four to five minutes while Campus Cruiser takes around 10 minutes. Uber’s faster response time lessens the potential danger a student faces when waiting alone at night around the USC neighborhood.
However, as a student-run organization, Campus Cruiser only employs student drivers, who the University is already comfortable with. Uber, meanwhile, hires a range of people aged 21 and older — which is more likely to include people with criminal records.
Uber’s track record does look concerning. The district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles filed a civil suit in December claiming that Uber misled consumers about the effectiveness of its backgrounds checks. The lawsuit stated that a number of Uber drivers with criminal records were discovered after they were ticketed at LAX. In one instance, a driver who had been convicted on felony charges for lewd acts with children had given over 5,600 rides as a driver. Another driver has been convicted of burglary and identity theft. Back on the home front, a USC student has claimed that she was raped by her driver in April after using Uber to leave a Downtown party. These drivers had all passed Uber’s background check in order to drive under the service.
But while these incidents create concern about whether Uber is safe or not, the evidence isn’t substantial enough to prove that Uber is less safe than traditional transportation services such as taxis. This is because many police departments don’t track assaults by where they happen — whether in a taxi, an Uber or on the street.
“As far as tracking the offenses in taxi cabs specifically, I don’t have a way to look this up,” said Grace Gatpandan, a public information officer with the San Francisco Police Department.
“We don’t keep specific data with relation to passengers being assaulted,” said Lee Jones, a spokesman for the New York Police Department.
So though recent news raises doubts about the safety of Uber, there is no definitive evidence about whether Uber is any more or any less safe than taxi services.
No background check is foolproof, and while one background check may do some things right, it may miss vital information caught by another background check. Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Uber, backed this up in 2014, when he wrote that at least 600 people licensed to drive taxis in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego failed Uber’s background check. The group, according to Sullivan, included 19 sex offenders and 36 people convicted of DUI.
Some of the security risks with Uber may be artificially overstated due to the influence of the taxi industry. Uber is currently valued at up to $50 billion — no small feat for a company founded just six years ago. Such growth threatens the traditional taxi industry. In Washington, D.C., taxi rides dropped by 9 percent from 2013 to 2014. One study showed that taxi use in San Francisco, the home of Uber’s headquarters, suffered a 65 percent decline from 2012 to 2014. Part of the taxi industry’s response to this threat has been to lobby intensely against Uber. According to an analysis by the Sunlight Foundation, for every $1 that ridesharing apps Uber, Lyft and Sidecar have given to state legislators, the taxi industry has donated at least $3,500. It would not be a stretch to believe that the fierce competition between the two organizations has tainted Uber’s reputation in some way.
The allegations surrounding Uber are worrisome. However, at USC, it is probably safer to take an Uber or Campus Cruiser than to walk alone on the streets around the USC neighborhood. And there is no substantial evidence suggesting that Uber is more dangerous than other transportation services such as taxis or Campus Cruiser. No service is perfect, and every service — whether it be getting a ride, swimming in the ocean or taking a plane flight — involves some sort of everyday risk.

As the fall semester launches into motion, so too do the people behind Daily Trojan Opinion pages to bring you the most advanced editorial section yet. This fall, Daily Trojan Opinion has rolled out an ambitious new vehicle in pursuit of of our old mission, and it is my pleasure to introduce a newly polished Opinion section which hopes to be both more thought-provoking and relatable than ever before. 
For this semester, the Opinion section is even more geared towards printing the issues that students really care about. By focusing more heavily on relevant campus issues — whether it be controversial stories in which USC may take part in, inter-campus controversy between on-campus organizations and administration or USG initiatives that affect student life — Daily Trojan Opinion will begin and continue crucial conversations on campus. When Opinion covers national or international news, we intend to do so with the Trojan in mind — for example, Opinion writers this semester have explored the effect of an increase in visibility for the transgender community on USC’s LGBT students and the implications of the Iran deal for Iranian-Americans, especially those at USC. A greater emphasis on on-campus issues aims to improve the topicality of issues discussed and increase our section’s engagement within the USC community. We remain committed to streamlining content for our loyal on-campus readers and to cater to the USC audience whom we serve. 
In a manner more personal and pertinent than ever before, the Daily Trojan Opinion section will feature a diverse group of talented writers, including four weekly and two bi-weekly columnists, who will share their thoughts and experiences with the USC community. In “Wait an LA Minute,” longstanding writer Jordyn Holman will explore issues that millennials face — be it choosing a college major or the inevitable feeling of running out of time on campus. “Campus Talk,” written by returning columnist Athanasius Georgy, will closely examine initiatives posed by the USC Undergraduate Student Government and controversies among different organizations on campus. Writer Kristen Woodruff will begin critical conversations with readers about issues in education, deputy features editor Sarah Dhanaphatana will examine local Los Angeles politics which affects our day-to-day lives here at USC in “Dhanapolitics,” and features editor Mollie Berg will share her experiences as an intern in “All in A Day’s Work.” These columns, formatted to allow readers to see columnists live through the modernization of college and the evolution of student life, ask the readers to be an intimate part of columnists’ journey this semester.
And yet, while introducing new directions for the newspaper to adapt to an evolving student body, Daily Trojan Opinion will continue the tradition of bringing to light contentious issues for which there appears to be no right answer. The return of the column “Point/Counterpoint,” run this semester by lifestyle editor Danni Wang and myself, plans to challenge readers’ preconceived notions and closely engage them to grapple with difficult questions which may have significant impact on student life.
The role of multimedia in these columns, as well as with more general Opinion content, will students to interact with stories and opinions in even more dimensions. With interactive timelines, tweets and multimedia maps, the different vehicles to deliver messages to readers will allow more close and thoughtful interactions as well as bring the Opinion section up-to-date as a truly modern publication.
This fall also kicks off the creation of an editorial board, which will present stances that the newspaper as a whole takes on crucial issues in the community. A tradition present at large professional newspapers like the Los Angeles Times  and the New York Times, the editorial board will fulfill our obligation, as an independent newspaper, to keep the University administration accountable and to keep readers informed about vital issues that affect student life. Composed of six editors and three longstanding Opinion writers, the editorial board will write weekly articles expressing majority-vote viewpoints on issues crucial for the USC community to examine.
As Opinion ushers in this new, more professional status as the editorial voice on campus, we also intend to keep readers engaged with lighthearted content. The institution of a new weekly comic focused on issues in college life — be it greek life, choosing a major or navigating social situations — promises to keep it real for students.
At the Daily Trojan newsroom, we’ve launched a status check, tested our gears and predicted our trajectory. Opinion is ready for takeoff — will you be on board?

Well, folks, it’s that time of year again. School has started back up, it’s ridiculously hot in Los Angeles and ESPN continues to obsess about the Southeast Conference. Here at the Daily Trojan, we thought we would add a little spice to your life by bringing you some college football pick’em predictions.
How did we make these predictions? Well, we flipped a coin.
OK, not really. Because football games generally only have two outcomes — win or lose — we created a logistical regression model using historical data for each team including passing offense and defense, rush offense and defense, turnover margin and ESPN’s preseason Football Power Index rankings. The output of this regression was then used to predict the outcomes of each of the games for Week 1.
Caveats:
Yes, there is a significant amount of change in the average team’s roster from year to year; thus, last season’s stats are not an ideal predictor for the performance of this year’s team. However, until Week 1 is over and we can incorporate that data into our model, our model is primarily dependent upon each team’s performance last year. To account for this, we included ESPN’s preseason FPI rankings in our model, which is a measure of team strength and meant to be a predictor of a team’s performance throughout the season. For our model, FPI rankings act as an aggregate of pre-season rankings for each of the teams.
As the season progresses we plan to incorporate game stats from each week and weight that data more heavily than the team’s 2014 stats so that our predictions are based more on the statistics and results of this season’s games.
With those caveats out of the way, here’s a look at all of the matchups this week between Football Bowl Subdivision teams.



Although Week 1 games are usually cupcake opener games — we’re talking about you, Baylor and Michigan State — there are a number of interesting matchups to look forward to.
Notable Matchups:
Alabama (3) vs. Wisconsin (20)
Though this game is the only Week 1 matchup between AP Top 25 teams, in past years this game would be considered a cupcake opener for Alabama. Alabama is known for its tough rush defense and big front seven, which would pose quite a challenge for Wisconsin’s run-heavy offense. However, since the team gave up 281 yards against Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl last year, expect to see Alabama come out ready to prove themselves.
Despite Melvin Gordon III leaving for the NFL after a fantastic 2014 season, the Badgers still have a running threat in Corey Clement. Even as the second-string, Clement rushed for 949 yards last season, proving he has the potential to be an offensive threat for Wisconsin.
Unless Wisconsin can get its passing game going, they’re going to have a tough time running against Alabama’s talented rush defense. Our model predicts Alabama winning this one handily.
TCU (2) at Minnesota
Last season TCU played Minnesota early in the season and routed them at home 30-7. While our model predicts this game to likely be a repeat of last year, there are several reasons why this game could be closer than our model indicates.
While it’s true that TCU, headed by Heisman hopeful Trevone Boykin, is a well-rounded team with high expectations, Minnesota is looking to continue its upward trend from last year. Minnesota has talent on both offense and defense despite losing running back David Cobb and tight end Maxx Williams, and with their home-field advantage, the Gophers are aiming to make this game much closer than it was last time around.
If TCU sticks to their guns and continues playing as well as last year, they should come out on top to start their national championship campaign.
Ohio State (1) at Virginia Tech
What initially was seen as an easy Week 1 match up for Ohio State has taken an interesting turn. The suspensions of Corey Smith, Jalin Marshall, and Dontre Wilson as well as Joey Bosa’s recent foot injury have affected the Buckeyes at the wide receiver and on the defensive line.
Ohio State’s personnel woes, combined with playing an away game against a team looking for a second big upset, could make this an opening game closer than our model indicates. Even if Virginia Tech creates a few scares, Ohio State will come on top to avenge their loss last season.
Arkansas State at USC (8)
It would be almost sacrilege for us to not discuss USC in our pick’em predictions. Our model heavily favors USC in their Saturday matchup against Arkansas State, which went 7-6 last season and doesn’t play in a Power 5 conference. While it’s true that last season we had several games in which we fell asleep at the wheel against lower-ranked opponents, with Kessler at the helm of our offense and increased depth and experience in our line, the Trojans look to have an easy win to start the season.

Though trends come and go, there are certain fashion rules that facilitate the transition from high school to college. Abiding by these style statutes may distract from the lost look in your eyes as you recover from USC culture shock and save you the embarrassment of becoming “that” freshman. The label is notorious, and labels stick — so let your style set the tone for your best year yet.
Time and time again, the lanyard discussion runs rampant, encouraging freshmen to blend in. But I cannot stress this enough — to the class of 2019: The lanyard you received during orientation should not be the sole keeper of your keys, wallet, etc. More importantly, it should not be worn around your neck. Yes, the convenience of having your personal items dangling over your belly button is tempting. However, a bright red lanyard never did a cute outfit any favors. Invest in small wallet with a key ring for your new ID card and key. I recommend getting a bright color so you can spot it when it gets buried in the depths of your backpack.
Functional, fashionable — enough said.
Though USC is internationally renowned for its infectious school spirit and unabashed pride, you do not need to wear multiple Trojan themed articles of clothing at once. I understand you are being bombarded with Trojan Family t-shirts and have spent half of your discretionary dollars on adorable book store apparel. As excited as we all are for you, please keep the USC paraphernalia to a single item at a time. I can spot a freshman instantly with their bookstore baseball cap, cardinal and gold tank top and USC embroidered backpack. The obvious exception is, of course, on game days. When it comes to football, let your USC freak flag fly!
Just don’t.
Or at least choose one or two staples and ship the rest home to mom and dad. I hate to break it you, but no one really cares that you were a lacrosse player for the Bulldogs or a Gator a-cappella captain. Save those shirts for the gym or for nighttime wear. USC is your new home and the Trojan is your new mascot, so embrace it! I would wear high school gear sparingly on campus as you will definitely get some strange looks from people questioning your school loyalty. Trust me, it happens. 

Long days and late nights can make dressing exclusively in sweatpants and t-shirts tempting. Though you will have your days in which dressing in anything other than pajamas is nearly impossible, don’t make it a habit. Professors may find it disrespectful as they take the time to dress appropriately each day, and even your peers might not take you seriously. Comfort is key, and there is a way to achieve it without looking like you just rolled out of bed. Invest in cute workout gear such as black leggings, brightly colored sneakers and a hat. You will look much more together and people will instantly assume you are productively dividing your time between class and gym. Don’t worry if that’s not true — your secret’s safe with us.  
These celebs have mastered the art of workout chic. Just add a backpack!
