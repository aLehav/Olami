One of the newest cultural groups on campus seeks to advocate for a demographic of students not even represented as a percentage in the ethnic breakdown on USC’s website — Native Americans.
The Native American Student Union, led by President Ava Burnell and Vice President Nys Trejo, was formally established this semester in the hopes of building a community for Native- American students at USC.
Burnell, who has both black and Native-American heritage, was inspired to start NASU after realizing she could find resources for support at USC that were aimed toward black students but not Native-American students.
Her experiences highlighted the need for an increased Native- American presence at USC.
“Historically, the way that Native Americans have been left out of higher education creates the idea that Native culture and the culture of higher education aren’t compatible,” Burnell said. “USC actually has horribly low numbers of enrollment of Native Americans, which is really embarrassing because Los Angeles has the second-largest number of Native Americans in the country.”
Burnell identified the addition of accurate information in the curriculum about Native- American culture as one of the critical issues NASU wants to tackle.
“For example, I took a class about the history of L.A., and I don’t think I heard the words ‘Native-American history’ even once, and we’re studying on land that was taken from the Tongva people,” Burnell said.
To achieve curricular change, NASU is currently working with USC’s Teaching International Relations Program to develop a lesson plan centered around the history of the First Nations. They have also collaborated with the LAUSD Indian Education Program to host a Native American Education Day at Foshay Learning Center, where they presented on cultural awareness and shared Native-American children’s stories.
Brooke Kidner, a senior linguistics and psychology major and a member of NASU, emphasized the importance of events like these in offering an alternative to the popular cultural narrative of Native Americans.
“The only narrative that most people are told about Native Americans is the First Thanksgiving and Disney’s Pocahontas. NASU’s club T-shirts say ‘#WeStillExist.’ Children in American schools are not taught that Native Americans are still here,” Kidner said. “They assume that we have superpowers, that we’re great trackers, that we can listen for hoofbeats in the distance — all these other ridiculous notions that are brought up in fairytales.”
NASU is currently focused on securing a space to establish a cultural center for Native-American students. Their efforts have been aided by the support of Associate Dean of Religious Life Jim Burklo, who played an active role in Stanford’s Native American community before coming to USC.
“As soon as we made contact with him, and he realized that there was now a student organization here, he was extremely excited to offer us a space at the University Religious Center,” said Jacob Broussard, a sophomore choral music major and a member of NASU. “We’re still in the works of solidifying that — securing the space — and the next step would be to go through the process of making the space more personal to Native American art.”
Burnell expressed gratitude to the Indian Education Program, certain members of the administration and Rosalind Conerly, NASU faculty advisor and Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs assistant director, for their encouragement and involvement.
“There’s such a small population [of Native American students at USC] that it’s going to take more than just the Native population, but also we need the non-Native population helping us and giving us their support,” Burnell said.
NASU is planning to host a powwow at USC and to organize further Native American Education Days, both in collaboration with the Indian Education Program. They are also hosting an event as part of EdMonth, entitled “Reclaim Your Narrative: American-Indian America Post-1492,” which will take place Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Taper Hall of Humanities, room 301.
NASU holds its weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m. in the University Religious Center, room 102.
This sounds like such an amazing organization making a real impact on campus!

Los Angeles County and the USC School of Social Work are now offering at-home mental health services for at-risk youth aged 12 to 21. This online mental health service is designed for youth who experience mild to moderate psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety disorders, trauma or other mental health concerns.
Operated by USC Telehealth and the School of Social Work, this online program will match licensed social workers and Masters of Social Work interns with at-risk youth. These therapy sessions will occur via Citrix, a secure internet platform that operates much like Skype.
“The county will identify youth to participate in this project, providing them with virtual mental health services which act as preventative measures to keep them out of the child welfare system,” L.A. County Health Deputy Karla Sayles said. “With this new project, we hope to keep youth who are at risk of entering the foster care system stabilized and with their families.”
To gain access to these services, youth can refer themselves to the Department of Children and Family Services or be referred by members of their community who are concerned about their domestic lives. Once an individual is referred, an investigation of the child’s home life is conducted and the department determines if the youth is at-risk. If it is determined that the youth is struggling with mental health issues that his or her family is unable to provide for, the child will be referred to the Department of Mental Health which will then offer services to address the individual’s needs.
USC School of Social Work Dean Marilyn Flynn highlighted the importance of serving children in particular.
“It makes sense to help people at the earliest stage,” Flynn said. “It is not that older adults are not suffering — they are — but this is very much a prevention measure in the sense that if we provide support, a sense of hope and alternatives to people in their early years, then the benefits and protective factors will last a lifetime.”
Flynn also noted that this program offers a way for individuals who feel uncomfortable with traditional in-person therapy sessions or who do not have adequate transportation to receive aid.
“People differ a lot in the way they like to receive help. Some people may not want to walk to a clinic or be seen in a waiting room,” Flynn said. “This element of anonymity at-home services offer acts as a form of protection that is especially meaningful to certain individuals.”
Flynn also explained that online services give the patient a sense of power and comfort.
“People often feel more in control when using telemental health,” Flynn said. “Maybe it is because they can turn off the screen when they want to, or maybe it is because the sessions are occurring in the comfort of their own homes.”
Sayles emphasized that by introducing technology to change the way mental health services are offered, a greater number of struggling individuals can receive the assistance they need.
“Technology makes this service accessible for people of this generation because youth these days are used to getting answers quickly and engaging with people over social media,” Sayles said. “This program is particularly in line with this generation because it gives individuals access to mental health services when and where they need it.”

Undergraduate Student Government Sens. Giuseppe  Robalino and Eric Dubbury have proposed a new bylaw that aims to diversify USC Program Board-sponsored events. The presentation of and voting on the third and final version of the bylaw will occur at the Senate meeting on March 29.
This bylaw has gone through three different drafts. The first version required a significant check on the USC Program Board, including a review by the Senate of particular events that were not promoting intellectual diversity. These events would then be either canceled or moved to a later date if found offensive to all ideologies of students. However, in case of a disagreement, Program Board would have the ability to appeal it to the judicial council.
“We wanted to make sure that [the bill] was fair and constructed correctly,” Robalino said. “So that we as the senators representing 18,000 students would be able to effectively represent all those students through the Program Board that is elected by a narrower constituency but receives money from everyone.”
Even though the Senate has the right in the bylaws to pass a bylaw change with a two-third vote, the senators wanted to make sure they were cooperating with everyone in the office.
Robalino and Dubbury decided to create a second version in response to Program Board considering the first version “too strong.” The second version was an open document, where Robalino removed the judicial council and review of the Senate on Program Board events. Since telling Program Board to cancel or postpone controversial events was the most divisive aspect of the bylaw, the Senators decided to remove that as well.
“We have had a lot of people come out regarding this bylaw because USG has recently been in a lot of contentious political controversy,” Robalino said. “Thus, it has been getting a lot of attention from the school and also national media.”
Program Board Executive Director Diana Jimenez could not be reached for comment.
Dubbury and Robalino are currently in the process of writing the final draft of the bylaw, which will include the involvement of all branches of USG in order to create diverse programming.
“They will come together and bring in ideas that will help create an open space, such that they are programming to all students,” Robalino said. “You are getting money from all 18,000 students. This can give people the opportunity to present ideologies from all partisan backgrounds.”
Each student pays $63 as part of their annual tuition to fund USG. Apart from going to the funding board of USG, a vast majority of it goes to Program Board. Dubbury and Robalino’s goal is to hold USG accountable in order to represent as many students as possible.
“We are talking about tens of thousands of dollars,” Robalino said. “There are branches in Program Board that receive $50,000 to $70,000. We want to make sure we are using this responsibly.”
However, some students questioned the necessity of this bill. Robalino argues that it is an essential step in order to protect student voices.
“‘Was this bylaw even needed?’ was the question I kept getting from Program Board,” Robalino said. “Though Program Board has enjoyed a lot of flexibility and freedom, we are trying to improve our quality of the student body. We want to improve and expand the conversation and make it accessible to more students.”
Robalino also responded to comments that the bill is trying to make Program Board more conservative.
“We are not asking to silence voices,” Robalino said. “If anything, we welcome the discussion of these varying opinions. It’s just when we talk on a nation-wide scale and making sure that when you are a member of an organization, you are not discriminative about race, origin or religion.”
In regard to events that led to the creation of this bylaw, Robalino spoke about an incident where people from the LGBT and other minority communities have told him how they don’t feel that they are always represented.
“They told me that they wouldn’t join certain organizations because their language turns them off,” Robalino added.
The senators are working on coming up with a bylaw that everyone will agree with.
“We have postponed officially presenting the proposal. We are on the third version right now and the first two that we had have not been formally presented,” Robalino said. “Before we present it, we want to start a buzz in the office and want the office to be aware that we are not trying to ram something through and just surprise them.”
Robalino wants to give people time to think about it because the second time when they had the opportunity to get more comments on the open document, the response rates were very low. Consequently, they postponed the official presentation of the third version.
“Over time, we hope to create a culture of openness and inclusion at the events so that we have a healthy disagreement,” Robalino said. “The composition of the groups in USG are diverse, but there is a trend to fall in one direction. Thus, we are there to remind them of the diversity they are committed to.”

The SoCal VoCals, a USC a cappella group, will complete their tour of Hong Kong and be back in Los Angeles on Wednesday after performing at the 2016 Hong Kong International A Cappella Festival on March 11 and 12. The group, on the heels of its victory in the 2015 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, received a special invitation by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups to perform at the annual event, which brings overseas a cappella groups together.
The Hong Kong youth group has been organizing this two-month-long festival for the past seven years. The festival includes indoor concerts, public and street performances and workshops and has become an eagerly anticipated annual event by many in the community. The 2016 edition of the international extravaganza saw an audience turnout of more than 5,000 at the arena in Queen Elizabeth Stadium.
A team of 14 singers consisting of veteran and new spring recruits was led by Jonathan von Mering, Nathan Heldman, Henry Mattei, Aaron Jung and Devon Lawrence. Apart from the SoCal VoCals, other popular a cappella groups from across the globe shared the stage. Seven from the U.S., Ommm from France, Metro Vocal Group for Hong Kong, HamojiN from Japan, HKFYG Hong Kong Melody Makers and festival ambassador Ng Yip Kwan also attended the festival.
The group said that their performance was well-received by the audience, and that it was one of the best appreciations they have received.
“Other than general sound concerns, our main goal was to perform with energy,” said von Mering, president of the SoCal VoCals. “The audience was very receptive — they were bigger a cappella fans than we usually see in the [United] States.”
Other a cappella groups from the USC community felt that the group’s achievement represented the greater work of USC’s vocal groups. Eric Hahn, a member of the mixed a cappella group Reverse Osmosis, lauded the SoCal VoCals’ work overseas and emphasized the support that such groups on campus give each other.
“Everyone in the a cappella community is very close, and everybody gets to know each other,” Hahn said. “It’s always cool to see friends of ours get real recognition in the broader a cappella community.”

When many students left campus last week for spring break, first-year Master’s of Public Diplomacy students Justin Chapman, Jung-Hwa Kang and Amanda Lester headed to Washington, D.C. for a networking tour of America’s capital.
The trip, which took place from March 14 to March 18, was entirely planned by the students.
It was billed as a “roving conference” where the participants received advice, information and even job opportunities from senior practitioners of public diplomacy to share with their classmates.
An MPD tradition over the last few years, faculty serve only the role of connecting participants with experts in D.C. they could potentially meet or sources of funding that may be available.
In their time in the capital, the MPD students managed to make more than a dozen meetings with high-level officials from the Brookings Institution, the U.S. Department of State and many other organizations while also making time to meet with alumni of the graduate degree program currently living in D.C.
Chapman said that meeting Capricia Marshall, a former U.S. chief of protocol and White House social secretary in the Clinton administration who is currently ambassador-in-residence at the Atlantic Council, was one of their most memorable experiences.
“[Ambassador Marshall] told us to grab every opportunity that we can. If someone asks ‘Who can do this,’ say ‘I can,’ then figure out how to do it,” said Chapman, who is also the project fellow at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy. “Make yourself invaluable.”
Marshall’s advice also stuck with Kang, who is still forming her nascent career goals.
Kang said that it set her free from guilt, reinforced the mindset she had been carrying and inspired her to walk out of her comfort zone.
“People often ask me what my plan is after completing the MPD program,” Kang said in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan. “They sometimes raise their eyebrows when I say that I am still exploring and figuring out my path, since I am learning a lot of new things in  the MPD program.”
The participants plan to share the information they collected in a report that will be internally distributed to students and faculty in the MPD program. The information will also be used to plan next year’s trip.
Along with building a stronger network for graduate students, the trip also has the intent of attracting interest to USC and the public diplomacy program. The participants had the opportunity to talk about their academic experiences thus far.
“We met with undergrads from Syracuse University who were interested in the program,” Chapman said. “The people we met with now have information and knowledge of the program and can recommend it to students.”
This year’s trip, under the auspices of Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest Wilson III and MPD Director Nicholas Cull, is one of many that seeks to provide public diplomacy students with opportunities for learning and future employment.
“I see the trip as an important part of the transition to the workplace for students in the program, both because it exposes students to potential employers and because it reminds people in the field of the program and its work,” Cull said.
According to Cull, past networking trips have been taken by MPD students to Vietnam, India, China, Indonesia and Brazil.
But the participants swapped the excitement of an international location with a feeling of validation about their career goals.
“This trip opened my eyes to everything that can be done with the skills I’m learning in the MPD program,” Lester said. “Besides receiving helpful career advice at our meetings, it was inspiring to talk to people who are doing public diplomacy every day, facing its challenges, believing in its promise and still searching for answers to the field’s biggest questions.”

Despite a last second defeat at the hands of Providence in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the USC men’s basketball team can hold their heads high. Throughout the season, the Trojans defied expectations and returned to the national stage.
Coming off back-to-back last-place finishes in the Pac-12, the Trojans were expected to once again struggle this season in a deep conference. Preseason polls projected the Trojans would finish in 10th in the conference, just ahead of both Washington schools. USC responded by winning its first five games of the season, including a stand out victory over Wichita State.
The Trojans continued their hot play into early February, boasting an 18-5 record, before they started to fall off. The Trojans dropped five of their next six games and dropped in the standings. After starting the season as one of the conference’s top teams, the Men of Troy had to settle for the seventh seed in the Pac-12 Tournament. USC handled UCLA in the first round before falling to eventual runner-up Utah in the second round.
After drawing an eighth seed in the NCAA Tournament, their best since 2008, the Trojans faced an experienced squad in Providence. It looked like the Trojans were going to move on and face North Carolina in the second round before a series of mental lapses allowed Providence back into the game. The Friars scored the winning basket with 1.5 seconds left after USC left a Providence player unguarded right under the basket. Junior guard Julian Jacobs missed a desperation heave and the Trojans were knocked out.
The Trojans had quite a successful season, especially considering the team only had one senior. The Men of Troy boasted wins over Wichita State, Arizona, Colorado and Oregon State, all of which were NCAA Tournament teams. The highlight of the Trojans’ season may have been defeating the UCLA Bruins three times in one season. The Trojans defeated the Bruins by an average of 19 points per game and blew them out by 24 in the opening round of the Pac-12 Tournament.
USC was one of the most well-balanced teams in the Pac-12 this season with five players averaging double-digit scoring. Jacobs and sophomore Jordan McLaughlin had breakout seasons, with the former being named First Team All-Pac-12. The duo boasted a combined average of 25.0 points, 8.7 rebounds and 9.7 assists per game.
Freshmen Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu contributed immediately to a team that deeply needed outside shooting and interior defense. Boatwright shot 36 percent from 3-point range and averaged 11.5 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. Metu chipped in 6.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game while anchoring the Trojan defense.
The Trojans are expected to return almost their entire roster next season. The only confirmed departure will be senior Strahinja Gavrilovic, who averaged only 2.6 minutes per game. The Trojans’ incoming recruiting class is led by four-star shooting guard Jonah Mathews. Mathews is the No. 72 overall prospect and the No. 1 shooting guard in California, according to Scout. Three-star recruits De’Anthony Melton and Harrison Henderson will also join what should be an experienced Trojan squad.
After sitting out a year due to NCAA regulations, Louisville transfer Shaqquan Aaron will be eligible to play. The former Cardinal transferred to USC after a disappointing freshman year under Rick Pitino. Aaron was a four-star recruit out of Seattle. Washington and ESPN ranked him as the No. 33 overall prospect and No. 1 prospect out of Washington. Aaron will look to fill a void on the wing for USC next season.
After two sub-par seasons under Andy Enfield, the Trojans took a giant leap forward this year. The Trojans set a school record by winning their first 15 home games, beat crosstown rivals UCLA three times and qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011. The Trojans will now look to build upon this season’s success and prove that they can continue to compete in the Pac-12. With most of their roster returning next year, expect the Trojans to make some noise on the national stage.
Sorry to say it really is not a success to any good basketball program. A .500 record in conference including 1 – 1 in the Pac-12 tournament. A first round loss in the ncaa tourney to a team that was clobbered in their next game. A terrible road record to some mediocre teams. An improvement of course, and beating the ‘ruins three times is always good.  Talk is cheap about next season until it is accomplished on the court somewhat like football the last few years.

The little guys of March have all been eliminated from the NCAA Tournament.
Thanks for the memories, Stephen F. Austin, Middle Tennessee and Arkansas-Little Rock.
In many ways, this postseason fiasco is all about the little guys. Their magic against the powerhouses never fails to appease college basketball fans’ morbid fascination with seeing their brackets crumble.
And while this Sweet 16 features exactly zero real underdogs, there is one particularly intriguing team still hanging around.
Of course we see you, Syracuse.
The Orange racked up 13 losses on the season. This meant that Jim Boeheim’s not-so-star-studded team was on the bubble to even make the field of 68. However, after its self-imposed postseason ban just a year ago, ’Cuse squeezed its way into the tourney and now has officially completed its return to primetime.
Because of Northern Iowa’s historic collapse against Texas A&M, Syracuse is really the last team remaining that truly feels like an enigma.
Wisconsin, Notre Dame and Duke also finished with 10 or more losses this season, but these teams were grabbing headlines with regularity. The Wisconsin hype train was fairly calm this season after the Badgers’ postseason run a year ago, but Notre Dame and Duke always seem to find the limelight.
Syracuse’s season was a different story.
The Orange’s four-game skid in the middle of the season certainly didn’t help this group leap to the forefront of media attention, nor did the team’s losing five of its last six games leading up to the NCAA Tournament.
Many fans likely saw the perennial powerhouse casually hanging out in the bottom right corner of the bracket and didn’t think much of it. Yet although Syracuse-Dayton appeared the definition of a tossup, the Orange clobbered the Flyers.
Surely Boeheim’s team didn’t have the ability to compete with Michigan State in the second game. Well, the Spartans somehow lost by nine to a sneaky good Middle Tennessee bunch. This set up nicely for ‘Cuse, who wrecked the Cinderella team from Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
Next up for Michael Gbinije and Malachi Richardson: Gonzaga. Gbinije and Richardson are Syracuse’s two leading scorers, but this team has flown so far under the radar that these names don’t really resonate like, say, Carmelo Anthony, Scoop Jardine or C.J Fair. The Bulldogs of Gonzaga cruised into the tournament as an 11-seed and simply dominated two quality teams in Seton Hall and Utah en route to the Sweet 16.
While this may look like a friendly draw for the good folks from Spokane, the admonition from a completely neutral columnist at a student publication is very real. Proceed with caution. Syracuse does not have a tremendous amount of pressure heaped upon its shoulders. Its zone seemingly always gives opposing coaches headaches in March and its balanced scoring at the offensive end represents a well-rounded, versatile attack.
The Carrier Dome, traditionally a cathedral of college basketball greatness, was seemingly just another gym this season. In fact, this middling ACC team was actually treated as such. ‘Cuse went .500 in conference play and looked perfectly average, yet these guys appear to be hitting stride at the perfect time.
As a program, having storylines — or even a roster — begging for television exposure during December obviously gets you nowhere in March. ‘Cuse is a legitimately dangerous team that could manage to escape the Midwest region if this upward trajectory continues against a talented Gonzaga side.

Sophomore Thibault Forget picked up his first Pac-12 Player of the Week award this week after stellar play at the BNP Paribas Open Collegiate Challenge, held last week at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
In two 4-1 USC victories over top-25 teams — Oklahoma and Baylor — Forget won his first match 6-2, 6-1 over Oklahoma’s top-100 player Max Mora, following it up the next day with a  6-1, 6-1 victory over Baylor’s Jimmy Bendeck.
In addition to this week, Forget has had a great season, currently on a 10-match winning streak, a key component of the Trojans’ recent three-match win streak, propelling them to a 10-3 record and top-15 ranking. Forget was the third player for USC to reach the 20-win club on the season, which will likely help increase his ranking past his current spot of 91 in the country. The award shows the depth of this year’s team, as Forget is the third player to claim the award, following senior Max de Vroome’s win last week and junior Nick Crystal’s win in January.
Forget is no stranger to tennis success, as his father Guy Forget reached two French Open finals in doubles and three Wimbledon quarterfinals in singles in the late 1980s and the 1990s. As a key contributor his sophomore year, Forget has a lot to look forward to as he gains experience throughout the next couple of seasons.
Forget and the Trojans travel north this weekend to try and remain hot as they begin Pac-12 play against Washington and Oregon before returning home to Marks Stadium to face the Cal Golden Bears on April 1.

With a crack, the ball lofted off of junior Corey Dempster’s bat and sailed towards left center field. The cheers of the crowd swelled as the ball rose over the outfield net and Dempster slowed his run to a jog around the bases. His solo home run — the second for the Trojans Monday night — put the team up a run in the eighth inning.
Dempster’s clutch homer was exactly what the Trojans needed. After notching an early lead over Cal State Fullerton, the Trojans slipped in the seventh inning and were tied going into the bottom of the eighth. The junior’s solo homer gave the Trojans the run they needed to bag a 3-2 victory over Cal State Fullerton, improving to 10-9 on the season.
“My thought was just to get on base, just to do anything to get on base,” Dempster said. “We feel good now, knowing we can make it in these close games. We have confidence at the plate and on the mound, so it’s starting to all come together.”
Senior Timmy Robinson gave the Trojans the lead at the start of the second inning, knocking a ball out to left center for a solo home run. After Robinson’s hit, Senior outfielder David Oppenheim reached for a single but the Trojans were unable to get past first base the rest of the inning. That remained the story until the fifth inning — the Trojans struggled to make contact and get on base.
The fifth inning briefly saw the Trojans come alive. The Trojans capitalized off of the Titans’ errors. Sophomore infielder Adalberto Carrillo took a walk after he was hit by a pitch and later stole third on a dropped ball by the catcher. Redshirt junior infielder Reggie Southall sent Carrillo home with a base hit to left center to give USC a 2-0 lead.
The game was a defensive on both sides. Cal State Fullerton pitcher John Gavin held the Trojans to four hits in the first six innings. A freshman who was an All-American in high school, Gavin provided a steep challenge for the Trojans to start the game.
“If you look at the weekend, we swung the bats extremely well,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I thought [Gavin] threw extremely well. He really kept us off-balance.”
On the opposite side, Trojan freshman CJ Stubbs kept the Titans to four hits in his 6.1 innings of work before junior Bernardo Flores took to the mound. From there, things began to fall apart. Flores struggled to find the strike zone, walking two hitters, including a bases-loaded free pass to send a run home. His third batter, senior Dalton Blaser sent a hard drive up center field, tying the game 2-2 and removing Flores from the game.
He was replaced by junior Jeff Paschke and USC ended the inning with a double play. Paschke settled the defense, providing the confidence necessary for the team to finish out the final two innings cleanly.
“I knew I was coming into a situation where I needed to throw strikes,” Paschke said. “I tried not to let the moment feel too big. As a bullpen guy, especially when we’re having this many close games, this kind of situation happens a lot. My focus is just trying to minimize as much as possible.”
Coming off a strong series against Cal and Monday night’s win, Hubbs feels that the team is beginning to come together on both ends of the ball. He pointed to their recovery after their seventh inning — along with their success against a strong night of Cal State Fullerton pitching — as a serious source of increased confidence for the team as a whole.
“One of the things that we preach constantly is picking each other up,” Hubbs said. “The guys just picked each other up. The team’s excited. I’m excited about the way we’ve been swinging the bats, and I’m excited about how we’re doing overall. If we can continue to do that, the sky’s the limit for what this team can do.”
Next up, the Trojans will take on UC Santa Barbara in a three-game series that starts Thursday on the road.

After spending spring break playing on the sands of Queen’s Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, the No. 3-ranked USC beach volleyball team (9-2) is back in action on the mainland when they host No. 6-ranked Long Beach State (2-5) and No. 19-ranked Cal (7-4) Tuesday at Merle Norman Stadium. First serve against the 49ers will begin at 12:30 p.m., while the match against the Bears will follow at approximately 2 p.m.
Starting out the season ranked atop the AVCA National Poll, a pair of tight 3-2 losses to Pepperdine and Florida State in a span of six days pushed USC back to sit at third overall in the nation. However, the Women of Troy seem to have regained their stride after a successful trip to the Islands, in which they posted four straight victories over tournament host and No. 5-ranked Hawaii and No. 15-ranked Nebraska to win the Hawaii Invitational.
USC defeated both schools twice over the weekend as part of the four-team tournament, recording a pair of 4-1 victories over the Rainbow Wahine and the Cornhuskers on Thursday. In Saturday’s rematches, the Women of Troy put up a clean 5-0 sweep over Nebraska in the morning and capped the evening off with a 3-2 win over the host school. With the victories, the Women of Troy extended their winning streak to five dual matches in a row.
In addition to winning the team tournament, the Women of Troy also produced a trio of champions in the Hawaii Invitational Pairs Tournament. USC’s top six teams dominated the field as all three championship matches in each flight were made up of USC pairs.
In the gold bracket, the No. 1-pair of juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes defeated teammates and the No. 2-pair of junior Sophie Bukovec and senior Alexa Strange, 21-15, 21-19. The silver bracket final saw No. 3-pair of juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler outlast underclassmen and the No. 4-pair of sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante in three, 21-15, 19-21, 15-9, while the bronze bracket final had the No. 5-pair of sophomore Jo Kremer and senior Zoe Nightingale win over the No. 6-pair of sophomore Terese Cannon and freshman Katrina Kernochan in two sets, 21-15, 21-18. Furthermore, the bronze flight had freshman Becca Dunn and senior Emily Young win the fifth-place consolation match as USC’s seventh pair. Overall, USC went 16-4 on the day, with three of those losses coming at the hands of other Women of Troy pairs.
After spending time on the island, the Women of Troy are now back in Los Angeles ready to face two in-state rivals at Merle Norman Stadium. USC will start with some familiar faces across the net in No. 6-ranked LBSU. Having defeated the 49ers once already this season, the Women of Troy have the upper hand playing at home. However, Long Beach State is one of just two programs in the country that own a winning record against USC all-time, albeit a slim 5-4 margin. The teams’ last meeting was back on March 6 at Zuma Beach for the Pepperdine Kick-Off, where the Women of Troy had to rely on Martin and Wheeler to win in 3 sets and seal the exciting 3-2 victory.
The No. 19-ranked Cal Bears also come to Troy with a four-match winning streak. Tuesday will mark just the second all-time meeting between the two Pac-12 foes, with the last meeting going in USC’s favor by way of a 5-0 sweep over the Bears. Both matches on Tuesday will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

The splendor and entertainment that the Vegan Street Fair  provided would make any visitor overlook the 30 minute waits at ticket booths and expensive prices. The overwhelmingly supportive and enthusiastic vegan community cultivated at the fest nullified  all complications. It was an engaging experience available for vegan and non-vegan foodies.
Aside from the 100 food and retail vendors, the DJ booth, chalk on the pavement and the many photo ops were well-received. People blithely danced to dance-pop hits, wrote hundreds of vegan-friendly messages on the pavement and took pictures in front of the various VSF backdrops.
The positive ambience at the VSF in support of the vegan community only enhanced the already delicious taste of bite-size food samples.
Walking through the entire fair once, the many food options were daunting. There was a large variety of food available: Asian cuisine, Mexican cuisine, American Southern cuisine, smoothies, ice cream, baked goods, dried snacks, drinks and more. Everything looked mouth-watering. After making a distinction between the overly long lines and the bearably long lines, Skynny Kitchen was the first stop.
Skynny Kitchen’s corn tortilla tacos, with mushrooms, tomatoes, corn, onions and leafy greens, were so savory. These delicious tacos, marked by their curry-like vegetables bathed in spices, are also very nutritious.
“We’re a healthy, fast, casual American restaurant located in North Hollywood. We have vegan options, vegetarian options, gluten- free options. Everything is 500 calories or under, and it’s a clean concept — it’s whole foods,” said Rips Avetisyan, an employee of Skynny Kitchen.
Next stop was Jaycelab. Their vegan deviled egg tasted incredibly real and their no-bake peanut butter chocolate bar was to die for. The hard-boiled eggs, created by Jayce Lab from scratch, is achieved through molecular gastronomy. Basically, he’s a genius. The no-bake peanut butter chocolate bar, with its crunchy base, mainly comprised of graham crackers, and top layer, consisting of baking chocolate, peanut butter and maple syrup and topped with cacao granola bits, achieved a great balance between sweetness and depth in taste.
A long line signaling free food prompted the next stop. House Foods, a tofu-based company that had its inception in the early ’80s, was giving away braised tofu tacos. The corn tortilla tacos, consisting of a minimal three ingredients — their famed tofu, onions and salsa — were quite tasty.
The marketer of House Foods, Ernie Piraza, explained why their tofu is the best.
“Our products are all made with non-GMO soybeans. All soybeans are grown in the U.S. Our products are readily available in basically anywhere you shop!” Piraza said.
The last stop, Pulp Pantry, was a necessity. Kaitlin Mogentale, a 2015 graduate of USC, started Pulp Pantry while at school.
“I actually was at a friend’s house at USC, it was my last year at college, and I saw her juice a carrot. I think one of the crazy things about juiceries in L.A. is, we have more than 200 organic juiceries, and when you go there, you see the bottle of juice, but you don’t actually see the pulp that is created … So I took my friend’s pulp home, started experimenting, and called ten juiceries and started picking up pulp from some of them.”
Pulp Pantry’s popularity is rising exponentially due to its presence at farmers markets,  its store and at the core, its wide variety of unique health snacks — especially their vegetable-based granola. Mogentale makes new granola flavors regularly that are always well-received. Her vegan “pop-tart,” consisting of a gluten-free flour blend, carrot pulp flour, dates and apples, was so wholesomely scrumptious.
Mogentale gave an inspirational speech about her career path and passion for the plant-based diet.
“The way to move forward is to collaborate with people.  I would never be where I am today if It weren’t without my peers and mentors who have helped me curate my brand and given me critical feedback on what’s the next step,” Mogentale said.
The Vegan Street Fair was a joy not only for its food but also for its uplifting message that supports a readily achievable plant-based lifestyle. Innovation, which was almost universal at this fair, drives the vegan movement, and makes it more popular and easily accessible for everyone. A compassionate, plant-based diet has never been easier to achieve, especially in Los Angeles.

Songwriter, guitarist and the lead singer of the band Junip José González wowed L.A. audiences to start off spring break with a moving performance at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Famous for his song “Crosses” featured on The O.C. and remixed by Tiesto, his haunting soundtrack for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and his several collaborations with Sia Fuller back when she was still with Zero 7, González spiced up his usual guitar-only routine with The Y Music Ensemble — composed of a flute, trumpet, cello, sax and two violins.
In this way, the concert was something of an anomaly for González. According to his website, he generally holds himself to “having everything on his albums reproducible solo in a live context.” However, his website also states that he “focused more on the role of being a producer” or worrying less about live reproducibility, in his most recent album, Vestiges & Claws. With this undoubtedly in mind, he performed with and without the accompaniment of Y Music for new and old tracks as well as a couple of covers.
Y Music opened the concert with three of their own tracks, one of which was supposedly inspired by the sound of an air conditioner, which was, pun intended, so cool. When joined rather unceremoniously by González, the group played an arrangement of “Crosses” that added a mournful depth much less pronounced in the guitar-only version. That being said, González’s guitar work was decedent and deeply moving, enhanced by the accompaniment rather than overpowered by it. After five exquisite tracks with Y Music including “The Nest” and “Lovestain,” González went back to basics, performing “Cycling Trivialities,” Junip’s “Line of Fire” and several other songs solo.
The combination and arrangement (courtesy of Y Music’s Rob Moose) was poignant in its subtlety and gorgeous to hear. Unfortunately, the venue ended up feeling somewhat at odds with the music at times. While the space was acoustically excellent for González’s mahogany rich guitar and classical accompaniment, it was a strange choice for what technically constitutes a rock concert. Though González’s works are for the most part what one might call sleepy-time music, more energetic tracks like “Killing4Love” (his encore) felt stifled by the formality of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The crowd too seemed torn whether to dress as if they were off to a rock show or the LA Phil, whether to yell in support or clap politely.
Beyond the acoustic merits of the concert hall, a lesser known but equally influential aspect of González’s work — his extensive academic background — may further explain this choice of an otherwise odd venue. González was on track for a Ph.D. in biochemistry before his music career took off. His second album, In Our Nature is inspired by two prominent bioethics books — Richard Dawkin’s The God Delusion and Peter Singer’s Practical Ethics according to an interview he did with Ground Control Mag in 2007. He even worked with Goteborg String Theory to arrange his track, “Cycling Trivialities” for full orchestral performance. With this in mind, it makes sense that many of his other tour stops are at universities — CalArts, UC Santa Barbara. Walt Disney Concert Hall frames his performance as the academic institutions do — as an object of study rather than a regular old rock concert.
While the venue may have stymied more enthusiastic responses, it did not stop a rogue catcall when González removed his coat, much to the audience’s amusement and González’s embarrassment. Overall, he spoke very little and seemed oddly nervous to be on stage, given his extensive musical background and expertise. He was lit very mysteriously throughout, often obscuring his presence entirely. He even fumbled a couple times with his tuning, though it was clearly not due to a lack of skill. It was astonishing how much sound he could produce with a single instrument, more layered than many bands can generate with multiple guitars. However, his discomfort on stage (or perhaps just at this venue) may explain why he is not more well known in the American charts given his musical merit.
Overall, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. His sound both alone and with orchestral accompaniment was framed amazingly by the venue, which was somehow made to feel smaller and more intimate by the painterly lighting. González is clearly an excellent musician, able to produce masterful work solo or collaboratively, regardless of whether that collaboration come from classical or popular influences. Though interacting with the audience is not his forte, the rich, multifaceted and lyrically intelligent sounds he produces do plenty by themselves.

Saturday was the first night of a pair of concerts headlined by R&B and soul singer, Leon Bridges, at The Wiltern in Los Angeles. Bridges found his sound writing songs while working as a dishwasher before being signed to Columbia Records two years ago. His vibe is true retro, with the influences of Sam Cooke, early Marvin Gaye, Little Richard and the essence of rock and roll and soul from the ’60s. His debut album, Coming Home, was a huge success, landing a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Album and the title track being featured in a commercial for the iPhone.
The opening act for Bridges was Son Little, another up-and -coming R&B artist with a heavier rock emphasis. As the lights came back on before Bridges’ set, there was a fair amount of anticipation in the crowd. The intermission between sets was somewhat lengthy, but as Bridges’ band took the stage, the crowd lit up with enthusiasm. The performers on instruments included a saxophonist, two guitarists and a bassist, drums and accompaniments on organ, tambourine and more. The band was dressed up in suits and ties seemingly a throwback to the ’60. This was much like Bridges’ own fashion style, which is pure retro, likely what some of his favorite artists from that era wore. Bridges received great applause as he grooved his way to the microphone, doing a dance that also looked like something of the ’60s.
“Smooth Sailin,” the opening song, had a great rhythm and saxophone solo that brought the crowd to their feet and kept them there the entire night. In the first several songs, Bridges demonstrated classy showmanship and camaraderie with his band. In between his dances or a snap of the fingers, the band and Bridges were perfectly in sync with each beat and hit, a feature that is less frequently mastered among today’s performers, which is part of the appeal and experience of a live band. Bridges explained his connection with the band members when he introduced them, noting that some of them have been with him since his earliest performances. Although his catalogue of songs isn’t deep since he is a young artist, Coming Home was more than enough to engage the crowd in every song, and it flowed seamlessly in the alternative order Bridges performed it in.
His performance of “Better Man” where he proclaims he’d “swim the Mississippi River” to get another chance with his girl, garnered a great cheer from the crowd. His solo acoustic performance of “River” highlighted Bridges’ ability to perform alone as well, and he did not crack under the spotlight, as his vocals on this slow, gospel-rooted piece was a highlight of the evening. Although Bridges appeared to be finished shortly after this song, the audience beckoned for an encore, and the band and the singer came back to perform an additional two songs, some of which were written while touring.
Bridges’ concert was definitely a blast from the past, but is as entertaining a performance as there is today. Bridges effortlessly pulls the audience in to match the groove of every song and gets the crowd to echo his lyrics. Bridges may be cut from a different cloth than today’s contemporary singers, but his style is authentically his own, with his clear passion and enjoyment of the music infecting the audience until they’re dancing with him.

There is nothing I find more exciting than opening night at the opera. As a former opera singer, I can speak from experience that this elation is shared equally among those on- and off-stage. There is a certain anticipation that inhabits the air, that when combined with the sophisticated attire of the patrons, creates a truly magical experience.
Last weekend, I attended the opening performance of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly at LA Opera. As a sucker for Italian opera, I had been looking forward to the performance for many months. Clad in a sports jacket and tasseled loafers, I felt a giddiness similar to that of a child entering a candy shop. As I entered the theater, arm-in-arm with my date, I prepared myself to be wowed.
I attend the opera as frequently as I can. Furthermore, I try to share my love of this art form with as many people as I can. There seems to be a very specific demographic that regularly visits the opera: old white people. But as I sat down in the theater, I noticed that most of the other patrons, aside from the privileged and elderly, were a multitude of friends and colleagues who identify as queer men: in singles, pairs, and even in large groups.
Though it isn’t altogether surprising, it is a known stereotype that gay men love the opera. However, as a gay man who strives to defy stereotypes, I oppose the notion that love of opera is predominantly associated with my sexual orientation. What does my love life have to do with my musical tastes?
Moreover, why is opera stereotypically associated with gay men? The media seems to contribute to this association. For example, on the early-2000s Showtime series Queer as Folk, the character Ted often expresses his intense passion for opera. In fact, most of the show is one enormous operatic reference, with both outward and subtle references to famous operas. Only a complete operaphile would be able to pick up on all of these allusions, which is possibly why they were included in the first place.
In addition, critic Wayne Koestenbaum’s book The Queen’s Throat provides an in-depth study between the relationship of homosexual men and opera. Koestenbaum argues that this fascination with opera stems from our admiration and identification of the “diva.” And though there is more to his argument, this claim seems a bit murky. My love for this art form has always stemmed from the music itself. As much as I love attending a live performance, I mostly prefer listening to old recordings in solitude. This way, I am able to fully immerse myself within the story without having to sit in a theater with hundreds of other patrons. The music always receives first priority. The drama is just an added bonus.
Granted, as years pass, this stereotype has dwindled down, as younger generations don’t seem to foster the same appreciation for opera as before. But I’ve never let my fear of being stereotyped prohibit me from doing what I love. Besides, being pigeonholed for my musical tastes isn’t exactly detrimental; I just remind myself that it stems from ignorance. So if my love for opera makes me “gay” — rather, “gayer” — then I guess I’m just another Queen of the Night.

Dwindled, perhaps, but young opera queens do exist! Picked up The Queen’s Throat and I’ve never been so completely exposed on the page before. Aside from his focus on the cult of the diva, Koestenbaum also explores “The Shut-in Fan: Opera at Home” which may be more your listening style. 
It’s also wise to keep in mind that The Queen’s Throat is a collection of personal essays, and no two opera queens are the same. As for the question of whether music or text is more important, well, that depends on the composer, the academic, and the listener.

On college campuses across the nation — including our own — students and administrators have been grappling with how to best address issues of diversity and maintain a safe campus environment for all students. It is against this backdrop that a University of California Regents working group drafted a statement detailing several “Principles Against Intolerance,” in an attempt to create a campus environment “in which all are included, all are given an equal opportunity to learn and explore, in which differences as well as commonalities are celebrated, and in which dissenting viewpoints are not only tolerated but encouraged.”
Despite this laudable goal, however, the UC Regents did the exact opposite — by conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. Such an implication is not only intellectually dishonest, but it also sets a dangerous precedent that both stigmatizes legitimate criticism of Israel and undermines serious instances of anti-Semitism.
Conceptually, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are clearly distinct. Whereas anti-Semitism is defined as prejudice or discrimination against the Jewish people, anti-Zionism is defined as opposition to the political movement of Zionism, which advocates for the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in Palestine and support for the modern-day state of Israel more broadly. Opponents of Zionism often challenge the idea of Jewish statehood on the basis that it inherently denies equality to non-Jewish communities within Israel, including its indigenous Christian and Muslim populations.
But whereas anti-Semitism is inherently hateful and intolerant, anti-Zionism is a perfectly legitimate — albeit controversial — political debate. In the same way one can question whether Israel can or should exist as a Jewish state for all of its citizens, one too could dispute the legitimacy of nations such as the Kurds, the Basques or the Taiwanese establishing independent states. By asserting that opposition to Zionism signifies a “prejudice and intolerance toward Jewish people and culture,” the UC Regents blur this important distinction.
This, of course, is not to say that anti-Semitism isn’t a serious issue on college campuses or that there aren’t anti-Semites who hide behind the label of anti-Zionists — far from it. Such actions should be exposed and fiercely condemned. But to blindly treat anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism as though they were two sides of the same coin overlooks the important fact that a overrepresented and growing percentage of anti-Zionists are themselves Jews.
Moreover, the fusion of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism also bears the risks of having a devastating impact on campus activism that is critical of Israel or its policies within the occupied Palestinian territories. Stigmatizing criticism of Israel as inherently discriminatory doesn’t help create the safe and vibrant exchange of ideas that the UC Regents claim to foster — rather, it stifles it.
As someone who has studied the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and visited the region several times, I can attest that this topic is challenging to discuss — particularly on college campuses. For students who are unfamiliar with the subject, it can seem confusing or confrontational. For those who are more familiar with it, it can feel personal and frustrating. I, too, have felt uncomfortable when my beliefs or views on this issue were challenged. But as students, we would be wrong to confuse this kind of discomfort with a lack of safety. We would be wrong to prioritize a campus climate in which one’s ideas go unchallenged at the expense of vibrant political discussion and the freedom to express conflicting political views.

“In the same way one can question whether Israel can or should exist as a Jewish state for all of its citizens, one too could dispute the legitimacy of nations such as the Kurds, the Basques or the Taiwanese establishing independent states.”  One could also debate this about the Palestinians and their legitimacy as a nation as well, since, there never was a country or nation-state of Palestine.  Many Palestinians are descended from Arabs who emigrated to the area with the conquest of the area by Arab tribes rfom Saudi Arabia.   There was a nation-state of Jews very early on in the area known as the fertile crescent – modern day Palestine called the Kingdom of Judaea.  There is a wealth of archaeological evidence suggesting the presence of Jews (and other indigenous nations) in the are as well.
And, as I recall, when Israeli leaders first doubted the legitimacy of the Palestinians’ demand for a state of their own, they were accused of being racist.  So be careful when you portray the legitimate aspirations of the Jews for their own state/homeleand as up for debate, because we can also have that debate about the Palestinians themselves.
While Saudis repress all their people (other than the royal family whom have private $500 million dollar private airplanes)… and while Saudis execute gays, women and Shi’ites on trumped up charges… and while Saudis export Islamist hatred across the globe…we focus our angst on Israel – the only country in the Middle East where Palestinians have the right to vote and where Palestinians serve in Parliament -for deep down we are really just
Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Abbas serves in his eleventh year of his four year term, and while Hamas rules with fear,
repression and intimidation, while education under the Palestinian elected officials focuses on Mein Kampf-like messages, and while women killers and baby killers are glorified by the perverse and despicable Palestinians we focus our angst upon Israel – the only country in the Middle East where Palestinians are free to protest and are allowed the luxury of free speech -for we are really just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Pakistanis ethnically cleanse that once entirely Hindu country of its few remaining Hindus we focus
our angst on Israel – a country with a Palestinian Supreme Court member – for deep down we are really just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Egyptians ethnically cleanse that country of its two thousand year old Coptic community we focus our
angst on Israel – a country with a more diverse demographic profile than any Muslim country in the Middle East -for deep down we are just Brown Shirts masquerading as humanitarians.
While Islamists turn Nigeria into the next Sudan with gang-raping and child kidnapping and mass killings becoming
commonplace we focus our angst on Israel – for we are hypocritical Muslim apologists -and deep down we are really just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Sunnis insatiably kill Shi’ites, and Shi’ites endlessly kill Kurds, and while Kurds endlessly kill
Sunnis and every variation of this blood-letting theme, we focus our angst on Israel – the only country in the world that has increased its green space – because we are just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Yemenis turn that bread basket of the Arabian Peninsula into a place of starvation we focus our
crocodile tears on Israel for deep down we are really just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.
While Islamists in Southern Thailand kill off over 5,000 Buddhists in the span of a few years we ignore their plight and turn our focus on Israel – a country that has contributed more medical and scientific advancements per capita of any country in the world – for we are today’s Brown Shirts, today’s Goebbels’ acolytes goose-stepping like a gaggle of mindless geese.
One of the main causes of rising anti-Semitism around the world is the perception that Jews uncritically support Israel’s illegal and oppressive occupation of the West Bank and its attacks against Gaza.  Here is how J.J. Goldberg described a 2014 report by the Jewish People Policy Institute: (What Happens in Israel Doesn’t Stay in Israel, Forward, Aug. 18, 2014)
Begin Goldberg quote—————–
Much of the report focuses on participants’ concerns about Israeli democracy itself — religious pluralism and discrimination against Arab citizens, for example. But one section is devoted to “The impact of Israel’s policies on the security and wellbeing of Jews around the world.” It warns: “There is clear evidence that periods of tension between Israel and its neighbors raise the frequency and severity of harassment/attacks on Jews in locations around the world.”   
In many incidents of physical attacks on Jews, the assailant cites Israeli actions as the motivation.  . . . And it quotes a 2012 Anti-Defamation League research report, “Anti-Semitism on the Rise in America,” which claimed, “Anti-Israel feelings are triggering anti-Semitism.”  
 It’s often argued, correctly, that anger at Israel shouldn’t lead to attacks on Jews in other countries. But enemies of Israel are already prepared to attack Israeli commuter buses and restaurants. It’s only a short jump from there to foreigners who identify themselves as Israel’s next line of defense and declare, “We are one.” 
End Goldberg quote—————————-
Bibi Netanyahu did not help alleviate the perception that all Jews unquestioningly support Israel, no matter how egregiously it acts.  Many of our politicians demand that Muslims loudly denounce Islamic extremism whenever a Muslim carries out a terrorist attack anywhere in the world.  And though it does not get nearly the media coverage it deserves, many Muslims have spoken out against the abuse of their religion as an excuse to commit terrorism.  I suspect they speak out for two reasons.  First, they speak out because it is the right thing to do.  And second, they speak out because they hope that if the public hears a loud Muslim voice condemning terrorism it will stem the rising tide of Islamophobia.     
In a similar manner, the more Jews are perceived as supporting Israel’s brutal occupation, the more anti-Semitism is likely to grow. Jewish protest against the occupation and for Palestinian rights can provide an inoculation against the cancer of anti-Semitism.  And one of the most important ways to speak out against the occupation is through support of the BDS movement, imperfect though it may be.
Now, many will call me out on that last statement. OK–suppose I’m wrong.  Suppose there are better ways to oppose Israel’s occupation than the BDS movement.  Or suppose I am wrong in my view that what Israel is doing in the West Bank as an illegal occupation. And suppose you think it is craven of me to suggest Jews should try to gain safety by giving in to threats by the enemies of Israel. For argument’s sake, suppose Jews should react to those threats by doing everything they can to oppose BDS–short of stomping on the rights of others.  Still, stifling the right of those in favor of BDS could inflame the very growth of anti-Semitism that those who want to shut down BDS so fear.
Whether you like it or not, whether the perception is correct or not–it will be perceived by SOME that THE JEWWWWWS are behind the suppression of a basic fundamental right.  Such thinking, of course, would be flawed.  Many Jews–even those who abhor BDS–object to the trashing of the First Amendment.  Unfortunately, their are many who are illogical and some are likely to be emboldened by this opportunity to spread hatred against Jews.
Supreme Court Justice Brandeis discussed the role freedom of speech played in preventing the spread of hatred.  His words in Whitney v. California are worth contemplating
Begin Brandeis quote—————————
Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties, and that, in its government, the deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an end, and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness, and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that, without free speech and assembly, discussion would be futile; that, with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty, and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. [n2] They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies, and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law — the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed.
Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free speech, there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one. Every denunciation of existing law tends in some measure to increase the probability that there will be violation of it. [n3] Condonation of a breach enhances the probability. Expressions of approval add to the probability. Propagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching syndicalism increases it. Advocacy of law-breaking heightens it still further. But even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on. The wide difference between advocacy and incitement, between preparation and attempt, between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In order to support a finding of clear and present danger, it must be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated, or that the past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated.
————-End Brandeis quote—————————-
There may be some within the BDS movement who are genuinely anti-Semitic.  Just as there are some who are gun owners who  are murderers.  Squashing genuine debate for the merits of BDS makes as much sense as taking away everyone’s guns because some are murderers.  And both actions run counter to the Constitution.

As a firm believer in America and the Constitution which describes the nation’s values, I hold free speech to be one of the bedrocks of our republic. Improvements in education and the advent of the internet have given rise to the ability for nearly all Americans to have a platform for their ideas to be heard. The beauty of truly free speech is its ability to createnear-instantaneous ideological genesis. For example, if someone spews racist  — and by default, fallacious — rhetoric on a social networking platform, a more intelligent individual can immediately deconstruct the bigoted assertion. However, the absolutely vital caveat of free speech is that it must remain an equal playing field. Once a topic or opinion is deemed “off-limits,” then the balance is off, and speech is no longer egalitarian.
American colleges, especially the California public school system, have shown an appalling, consistent disregard for the First Amendment, including not only its enshrined right to free speech, but also the rights to freedom of assembly and the press. I discussed this issue previously when I condemned California State University, Los Angeles President William Covino for banning Ben Shapiro from speaking to an independent club on campus. Additionally, students themselves increasingly show intolerance for diversity of ideas and philosophies, going as far as to debate at the University of Oregon to silence the quotation of a famous line from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech because it does not incorporate other forms of diversity. This is a new world order: if you oppose an idea, shut it down! How mature.
So it should come as no surprise when the UC Board of Regents added anti-Zionism to their ever-growing list of discrimination which the University of California deems “unacceptable” on campus. While my inner libertarian laments the increasing size of American speech codes, a more pragmatic side lauds the Regents for evening out the playing field, especially for a minority still so unfairly discriminated against and maligned. In an era in which basic news reporting of the Cologne New Years’ attacks was deemed racist and the Daily Mail was strong-armed into blocking Swedish readers from reading a news story about a crime committed by a migrant to avoid the dreaded Islamophobic label, it only makes sense that Jewish activists and advocates would begin to seek the same protection.
Furthermore, it is important to note that anti-Semitism has plagued American college campuses, and without official action condemning this bigotry, this latent, oft-ignored disease will continue to grow. Many critics of the Regents, including the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board, condemn the conflation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism. If rhetoric regarding the political status of Israel remained civil and objective, perhaps this criticism would be justified; however, this is just not reality. The discussion of Catalonian sovereignty cannot be equated with Zionism, simply because Catalonians are not trying to liberate themselves from a legacy of genocide and racism. Most importantly, actual racism against Jews is terrifyingly alive and well, with numerous accounts of swastikas and anti-Semitic rhetoric across college campuses.
According to the AMCHA Initiative’s report titled “Antisemitic Activity in 2015 at U.S. Colleges and Universities With the Largest Jewish Undergraduate Populations,” “the primary agents of anti-Semitic activity are anti-Zionist students and faculty boycotters.” Before you assume that this study is a product of propaganda, I encourage you to read it in its entirety. The horrifying incidence and correlation of Jew-hatred and Israel-hatred speaks for itself.
The First Amendment is subject to certain restrictions. The UC speech code, as well as all speech codes in public institutions which censor Constitutionally protected speech, however, are unlawful and create an environment in which all marginalized peoples must seek special protections. In this new order, shutting the opposition down is as much an offensive weapon as it has become a defensive one. Thus, while we still have speech codes, we might as well use them to protect a historically, systematically persecuted minority. Perhaps one day we will realize that truly free speech is the only level playing field for debate and ideological progression, but until then, we have to artificially level the playing field to defend the right of Jewish sovereignty, let alone their right to existence.

Spare me the drama and self-righteous Jewish angst.  I’ve noticed many people support free speech until someone disagrees with them. Then they have the nerve to get riled up and claim they’re being persecuted.  When you say free speech has its limits, you really mean to say it’s limited to anything that concurs with your own opinions and views.  Actually, free speech is limited in that it doesn’t allow for slander and threats of violence.  Many social conservatives claim their free speech rights are violated by laws against homophobic discrimination.  Witness what’s happening in North Carolina right now.  The Christian majority is fueling
the myth that they’re being targeted for their faith.
Speaking out against hate and violence is not the same as threatening to bomb a building.  The Israeli government has metamorphosed into a veritable terrorist organization with its brutality against the Palestinian people who have occupied the region for millennia.
Jews are NOT the only people on Earth who have ever been subject to discrimination, hate and genocide.  The Nazi Holocaust of World War II is just that: the Nazi Holocaust of World War II. It’s not THE Holocaust; it’s A holocaust; one of many that have occurred throughout the world’s history.  Like Christians, Jews have not suffered here in the U.S. or anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.  They’ve all prospered very well, often off the backs of the indigenous peoples and African slaves dragged over here in chains.  The latter two groups are still suffering the effects of violent European colonization.
It’s interesting to note that just yesterday the CUNY school systems were revoked from receiving anymore state aid until they take realistic steps to prevent the growing anti-Semitism on their campuses.
Here’s to hoping the California legislature has the courage and decency to do the same thing.

A New York Times opinion piece published late last month argues that girls are raised to be fearful and reserved. Ultimately, this trend culminates in an apprehension toward taking career risks or simply making everyday decisions. Moreover, academic studies demonstrate that young girls are socialized into becoming fearful and cautious women. This socialization, in turn, hinders their development of particular skills and qualities. On a college campus, it fails to prepare them for dealing with dilemmas, such as choosing majors and pursuing career opportunities. Such socialization should be fought in schools so that its effects are lessened in the workplace.
Professor Campbell Leaper of UC Santa Cruz conducted a 2013 study entitled  “Parents’ Socialization of Gender in Children,” in which he found that in Western societies, gender-specific activities separate the behavior of boys and girls as they grow up. A girl may be told she can play with dolls, but not with a soccer ball — and for a boy, vice versa. He also notes these structures are slowly disintegrating but are still pervasive today. Strict family roles and expectations for the children continues to separate boys and girls from a young age.
Girls are conditioned at a young age to avoid trying anything with a degree of risk. This fear takes a heavy toll on young women beginning to taste independence on a college campus, an environment that provides many opportunities to grow academically and socially. Not only may girls dress or behave in a way that they believe will help in securing a group of friends, but they may also shape their undergraduate experience according to activities that pose the least risk. For example, many freshmen may choose to confine themselves to greek life, which appears more familiar, rather than joining other types of organizations, like entrepreneurship clubs or professional development organizations.
Societal pressures surrounding appearance, behavior and personality further encourage women to be appeasers rather than stand up for themselves. Women are praised for politeness and a subdued demeanor, and chastised for being opinionated. Moreover, fear of criticism is the driving force behind this complacent and docile appearance. Despite the preference for “cute,” subdued women, this view fosters a lack of confidence that has long-lasting implications. It renders women increasingly vulnerable to gender discrimination and gender-based violence. Additionally, their fear of taking risks makes them unprepared for unforeseen challenges. More severely, women may fail to report cases of sexual assault out of desperation to fit into deeply ingrained roles. Women are socialized into prioritizing a docile comportment over protecting their own physical and emotional health.
Beyond the uncomfortable truth of the social demands women face in college, the fear of judgment they became acquainted with from early childhood can greatly affect future career opportunities. A lack of self-confidence, an apprehension toward competition and a longstanding fear of risk-taking hinder women’s abilities to secure high-level positions in nearly all sectors of the economy. In 2013, the online forum Lean In began a social media campaign that asked women what their fears were and the role those fears played in their lives. The campaign’s results confirmed the detrimental effects of teaching women to be fearful at a young age. The most common fears were owning their achievements, volunteering their ideas in the workplace, a fear of upsetting others, and a general fear of failing. Failure was viewed as the underlying fear motivating all other anxieties. Thus, as girls are discouraged from trying new risky activities, they become apprehensive toward taking initiatives. They would rather steer clear of precarious situations or uncertain career opportunities than experience setbacks.
There needs to be a greater consciousness about the discrimination toward women present in the workplace, notably regarding unequal pay, and a concerted effort to promote fairness. Using a similar framework to that used by Lean In —- which provides practical steps to confront injustices — for action, academic institutions ranging from elementary schools to colleges need to take the initiative to make women comfortable with leadership roles and traditionally male-dominated positions. Combating discrimination begins in schools, and institutions must encourage women to take risks and empower them to be individuals with the self-esteem to determine their own role in society. —

I pen this open letter to the sane and responsible USG senators, however many there may be, recommending that they do not vote to impeach Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn at the hearing on March 23. This is by no means a statement of support for the senator, who has by all means earned his own dismissal from USG with his crude, unprofessional behavior. I have written elsewhere of my specific grievances with Sen. Ellenhorn; this is not the place to repeat them.
Instead, I will focus on the situation itself.
There are two reasons impeachment is a bad idea. The first is straightforward and procedural — the charges are not well-founded enough to justify impeachment. They’re vague, speculative and weak.
Filming an event without a permit? Worse offenses have been punished with a slap on the wrist. Writing slander about fellow USG members without confronting them about the issues he discusses? And misrepresenting the student body? That sure is wrong, but it’s covered under the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution. Creating hostile environments that perpetuate sexism? Again, clearly something wrong, but still something covered by the First Amendment. There are probably plenty of bylaws violations here and there, but if they’re dug up specifically in Sen. Ellenhorn’s case and not in other cases, is it any surprise he’s taking the opportunity to complain about discrimination?
So first off, the filers of the complaint are on shaky legal ground, as evidenced by their own submission. Better to back off rather than lose a complicated case.
But the second reason is far more important. The only thing Sen.Ellenhorn would like more than winning the impeachment trial is losing the impeachment trial and being removed from office.
Why?
Because if he’s removed, it confirms to him his theory that there’s a vast left-wing conspiracy on campus out to get him and exterminate all conservatives. It would be a validation of his conservative-victimhood worldview and would delight him beyond belief. It would probably also skyrocket him to national prominence.
Every time something has happened suggesting that his worldview might be even a tad bit inaccurate, such as the responses to the Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos speaker events, Sen. Ellenhorn has defensively and self-righteously called in the cavalry to blow up the issue into a niche national controversy. Such right-wing “news” sites as The College Fix, Campus Reform, Breitbart News and Fox News have covered USC’s allegedly liberal attacks on conservative free speech. Sen. Ellenhorn has predictably exhibited this behavior during this impeachment controversy.
Impeach Sen. Ellenhorn, and he’ll be portrayed as a poor, oppressed dissident in the national conservative media, wrongly reigniting the debate about free speech on campus. I wouldn’t be surprised if non-conservative publications like the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post take up the story and spread Sen. Ellenhorn’s fame, albeit less supportively than conservative sources.
Sen. Ellenhorn wants to be martyred. He loves the attention and fame. He’d be a kid in a candy shop if he were impeached.
USG senators, I implore you not to entertain Sen. Ellenhorn any further. Please do not remove him from his office. A few more weeks of his antics are well-worth averting the firestorm he hopes to bring.
And conservative supporters of Sen. Ellenhorn, I warn you — you’re being duped by a fraud. There’s no conspiracy against Sen. Ellenhorn but what he’s consciously endeavored to create over the last couple of years. Don’t put your name on his harebrained crusade.
Luke Phillips
Senior, international relations
The best way to avoid being seen as targeting conservatives is to not target conservatives. I know it’s not easy being a leftist, but sometimes simple is better.
This is very good. Certainly Jacob Ellenhorn needs to do some serious growing up. I’m surprised that someone of with the lack of nuance in his thinking got into an academic school like USC. But Phillips is also right to say that martyring this kid is the worst thing that could be done. Do what should be done to all teens going through an awkward period: ignore them.
“Ignore them” is the proper response to Bernie Sanders’ college cronies who are so personally offended by opposing viewpoints that they pull stunts like this. This article is adequately summed up as follows: “We can no longer go through with impeaching this student on bogus charges because he’s conservative and we don’t like him because everyone has started to notice that we’re only impeaching this student on bogus charges because he’s conservative and we don’t like him.” Luke Phillips and his fellow sensitive snowflakes should be utterly ashamed.
Well you’ve learned the talking points well and you seem to have taken shots at both young people and Bernie Saunders with no grounds whatsoever. At least it makes your own failure to think more conspicuous. The author of the piece which you are commenting under IS a conservative. Shock. Wait. What? Yes. The world isn’t so black and white. It isn’t “my team” vs. “their team”. Rather than watching Fox News, getting angry and paranoid, why not start from scratch and go looking for views of your own? God bless you in your journey.
Super cute response full of personal attacks instead of any logical thought process leading to a coherent rebuttal. Care for a mulligan?
The irony that you summed up your own post is fairly amusing. Luke Phillips is a conservative. He’s a member of the USC College Republicans. He works for Republican candidates. You come on here, lash out wildly at people who have nothing to do with this issue- like Bernie Sanders- and then try to condescend to people who point out your idiocy. You’ve made yourself look a little foolish here. Not your finest hour on the internet. Tomorrow is another day.
Taking a sarcastic shot at someone isn’t the same as dismissing an entire argument because of your own wild assumptions, such as “you watch Fox News and are angry and paranoid”, nice try though~ 
Would you like to address the bogus charges which were brought by one extremely liberal student against a conservative student, which the other senators openly admit are bogus charges? Or would you prefer to ignore that discussion altogether and continue this ugly little tirade against me personally?
You are just going to let your own mistake slide without an apology?
Ah, the second option, ignore the issue at hand altogether. A typically liberal tactic. Good show, mate!
Is this performance art? You sauntered in, accused people disconnected from the issue as being behind it, made a faulty assumption about the author of the piece based on your own myopic worldview, attack a poster and accuse them of ignoring random things you bring up, and then think you’ve somehow scored a point along the way. Seriously, stop. Reflect. Why did you assume Phillips was a liberal? Is it because you see the world as Senator Ellenhorn does as conservatives (good) and liberals (bad)? How were you brought to this Manichean way of seeing the world? How do you deprogram yourself? Are you even connected to USC? Or do you just troll the comments section trying to berate liberals and show solidarity with self-described conservatives when you don’t even personally know the facts at hand?
Irrelevant personal attack coming in 3, 2, 1….
You know we can all see that you’re upvoting your own posts… right?
Yes. I’ve downvoted most of yours too. Not a good day for your random assumptions so far…
This is all coming from the guy who opened with “he needs to grow up, how did he even get in to this school, just ignore him”. 
I haven’t assumed anything about the author of this piece except that he’s a sensitive snowflake. Anyone who considers a conservative guest speaker’s mere presence “a hostile environment which perpetuates sexism” is, in fact, a sensitive snowflake who can’t handle opposing viewpoints. 
I know you’re dying to hear more about me and my life, but I’m really interested in your thoughts on this specific issue.
From your Disqus profile, it seems like you use this phrase “sensitive snowflake” a lot. Kind of a talking point of yours. It’s rather silly. Also, yes, it does indeed come from a guy who said that. So? I’m right. He should be ignored. He’s pulling stunts to get attention. Have you met him? In the words of “Mean Girls”: “Do you even go here?” And, no, Phillips is not a sensitive snowflake. He’s a conservative who thinks Ellenhorn is a shoddy Senator. And he’s right. He is also saying that he shouldn’t be impeached for it. I tend to agree. Did you even read the article?? Again, you seem to be trying very hard to fit this into a conservative vs. liberal thing when it isn’t.
Ah, so when you attack people’s character you’re right, says you. I’m convinced! 
It could not matter less what his personally political philosophy is. His basis for thinking Ellenhorn is a shoddy senator, as stated in this exact piece of writing, is that he invites guest speakers who don’t fit into the college social justice activist ideal. Do you share that line of thinking? That opposing viewpoints create unsafe environments?
Phillips has invited speakers who don’t fit that profile, so I consider your imputation unlikely. Where do you see him argue that in the text?
{ Creating hostile environments that perpetuate sexism? Again, clearly
something wrong, but still something covered by the First Amendment. } 
In the original complaint, the proof used to support this claim is that he invited speakers like Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos. He agrees that this is wrong and only tolerated because of the First Amendment.
He’s right. Just because Senator Ellenhorn invites stupid speakers shouldn’t see him impeached. Do you think he should be?
The last question is a good one. Would you say radical Islamic preachers create unsafe environments? Just curious.
Radical Islamist preachers are deemed so because they prescribe violence, which is not protected by the First Amendment. None of the speakers on college campuses, save a large number of Black Lives Matter “protesters”, have actively prescribed violence. A good attempt, but try again.
So the answer to my question was “yes”. That’s all you had to say. And so the answer to your own question was yes. USC is a private school, a private community, and a place run by its own rules and norms. Do you think that these should only be limited to those of the U.S. Constitution? For example, on parts of the campus, people are asked not to ride bikes. Is this an outrageous affront to liberty in your view?
Radical Islam is not an opposing viewpoint, it’s a political philosophy. A normal Islamic speaker would not be considered radical and therefore would not be creating an unsafe environment with his presence, so the answer to my originally posed question is still no. Comparing apples to oranges is not helping your argument, and you’re teetering closely on exposing your own anti-Muslim bias here.
You’re dancing but you can’t get yourself out of your own contradiction quite so easily. If a radical Islamic preacher were invited to campus but didn’t directly counsel violence when at USC, you’d be fine with it?
I’m not the one who apparently doesn’t understand the definition of the word radical.
Are you trying to ask me if I’d be okay with a fundamentalist Islamic preacher speaking at campus? Yes, that already happens frequently with many faiths, as long as they’re not advocating violence or physical action against anyone (which is what makes someone a radical).
Look up the definition of “radical” in the dictionary. It doesn’t mean what you think it does.
Good for you. But you’re being tremendously naive. Because someone doesn’t directly advocate violence doesn’t also mean that they can’t also create an unsafe environment. For example, if I held a rally on campus which said “gingers are evil. They stink. They are sub-human. We’d be better off in none were on this campus. In this country. They are a threat to our way of life. They must be stopped.” Say that I did this with a megaphone, big pictures of ginger-haired kids with one of those red circles and a bar across their heads. Do you think, if you were ginger and walking through campus, that you might feel unsafe if loads of people were there whooping and hollering?
Is there some amendment or law on the books that declares all speech must be 100% agreeable and all environments universally hospitable? If a ginger in that situation feels unsafe, they need to leave that situation. That’s their option if the only thing they’re being confronted with are words. 
Many people feel unsafe with borderline militant racial groups advocating on campus, yet that is also protected action as long as they remain on the nonviolent side of said borderline. It goes both ways and we all have to accept that.
This is actually turning into an interesting conversation. I wasn’t expecting this from how you started.
Is there some law? No. Students often read challenging material, whether it is looking at the Rape of the Sabine Women in Art History or reading the Communist Manifesto. People can and do have disagreements about what is discussed on campus. If a Holocaust denier was invited to campus, I’d expect I would join a demonstration against whomever invited them, for example. I think it would probably make many Jewish students on campus feel unsafe and it is stupid to have invited them just because they have “an opposing viewpoint”. Equally, I think we can do better for ginger students in my hypothetical by saying that we don’t want that type of thing on USC’s campus. Don’t invite anyone who would do such horrible things. That’s not being a “sensitive snowflake”, it’s asking for certain rules of civility while we discuss the issues in a rational way.
But then I also agree with Luke that Senator Ellenhorn shouldn’t be impeached for his foolhardiness in inviting radical speakers. I think he should respect rules of civility more. But being an attention-seeking eejit isn’t an impeachable offense. But then you lambasted Luke and Bernie Sanders (for some reason) for just such a reasonable point of view.
Your making the point.  Just because you think it is stupid to invite a certain speaker does not make it so.  No one appointed you or anyone else the arbiter of what is stupid.  Your condescending attitude is so typical of someone who thinks he is an intellectual elite.
Again, you are trying to play politics because you like conservatism rather than thinking about the issue. USC’s community makes all kinds of rules about how we government ourselves. And some of my preferences are just that, but it doesn’t make them any less relevant than anyone else’s. I prefer flowers by SOS. I think too many bikers make walking dangerous on Trousdale during lecture hours. Perhaps these thoughts also make me think I am part of an intellectual elite. Perhaps having an opinion is OK? A thoughtful conservative (you know, the people who it would be good if USC Republicans started inviting again to educate campus and provide diverse political opinion) is Allan Bloom. He wrote a book called “The Closing of the American Mind”. He said that it was liberals who had made people scared of saying things are “better” or “worse” and that everything had to be valued equally for politically correct reasons. You seem to be trying to impose the same fascist tendency onto me. And I reject it. Ellenhorn is a BAD Senator. He’s invited DUMB speakers. And I think civility is BETTER than a-holes shouting at people. I want good conservatives on campus, not clowns.
The problem is that the “unsafe environment” is in the eye of the beholder.  Too often it is used to try to bully or intimidate opposing points of view.  Often the same “snowflakes” or “cupcakes” (take your pick) alternate being hurt/distressed and taking violent action including trying to prevent access to speakers with physical intimidation (See Ben Shapiro CSULA).  Nothing but fascists.
You seem to be giving characteristics to people you’ve never met based on little evidence to fit your worldview. This is somewhat ironic. This has not been done at USC much before. 3 speakers that I can think of. And USC has hundreds upon hundreds of speakers every year.
It is also a leap to say that they all “prescribe violence”. If they said exactly the same things but didn’t directly recommend the commission of violent acts, would that mean that the atmosphere would cease to be hostile?
RADICAL Islamists all prescribe violence, that’s why they’re considered RADICAL. You’ve attempted to ask me a loaded question which has exposed your own ignorance. Again.
Haha. You’re not very happy when you’re shown to be pulling a political line rather than a principled one, are you? (1) That is a definition that you have just literally made up; (2) the limits to free speech in the Constitution is for direct incitement. Can other types of words create an unsafe environment? If a speaker deemed a race “sub-human”, would this create an unsafe environment on campus for people of that race? If I ran a private community, should I have to permit all speakers invited to speak even if they say stupid and noxious things about members of my own community?
Preaching violence is direct incitement. There is no political line here, the line is whether or not you are calling on people to physically harm others. If you look up “radical Islamism” on wiki you get redirected to “militant Islam” and “Islamic extremism”. This is a political definition that has been established for decades, don’t try to excuse your ignorance, just learn from it and move on. 
A speaker deeming a race sub-human doesn’t incite violence any more than saying people who eat meat are sub-human. This is simply an opinion. It does not create any environment. 
The person who began the impeachment process is a fellow senator, not an administrator. We wouldn’t be having this discussion at all if an administrator of a private school denied the speaking request, but that’s not what happened. You keep thinking up these hypothetical scenarios and comparisons that are completely irrelevant to this situation.
Ah, wikipedia. You got me! Chortle. “A political definition established for decades”? Not really. For example, plenty of people apply the term “radical Islamist” to those who advocate for Sharia law. But we’ll let you off the hook on that one….
On your second paragraph. This is clearly not true. One can clearly affect an action without directly advocating for it. For example, look at a lot of political advertizing. Not all of them say “Vote for Bruce Blockhead on May 5th”. But don’t you think that’s what their intention is? It’s trying to sway the environment so that more people carry out that action. Many conservatives think that the media is biased against conservatives and that this harms conservative candidates at the voting booths. The idea is that by creating a climate of opinion hostile to conservatism, people are less likely to vote for those candidates. Most point to articles which don’t directly say “don’t vote for Ted Cruz, he’s a big-eared loon” but have more subtle biases. I don’t know whether you have read much economics, but read Hayek’s “the Intellectuals and Socialism” when you get a chance. It implies that intellectuals create an environment conducive to actions that further their cause. I don’t think Hayek was so naive as to think it was only their direct advocacy of precise policies but create an intellectual firmament.
And, lastly, yes. What’s your point? Students help run the private community that is USC too. Again, they are not confined to the U.S. Constitution as to the rules governing it. Just as they have not consulted the founding documents over bike prohibitions either. Your coming in and telling them how to run their own community is rather authoritarian and Big Brother.
{ For example, plenty of people apply the term “radical Islamist” to those who advocate for Sharia law. }
Those are fundamentalists… that’s the difference between a radical and a fundamentalist, one goes by the book in their personal life and one effects those who don’t want to participate. 
A bias is not a physical action, I can be biased against people who think green apple is a good flavor without wanting to eradicate those people from this planet. Biases don’t incite action, either, becoming violent is a personal decision that can only be blamed on that individual. 
You’re arguing law semantics now. The students don’t have the authority to deny speaking rights to those that the administration approves, they know this, so they move to deny a position of authority to the one who invites problematic guests. The people who see a glaring ethical problem with this action are not the authoritarians.
Fundamentalist is a political term. So is radical. Many people call Sharia Law “radical”.
And, yes, I think people should take personal responsibility for their actions so I agree with you that violence should be primarily blamed on the person committing the action, but we often make causal claims for political advertizing (“Cruz’s ad blitz saw him close the gap..”, “McDonalds advertizing boosted sales”) where they don’t directly tell people to commit an action. “Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh…I’m lovin’ it” certainly creates an environment where I want to eat a hamburger.
Also, the administration did not “approve” those speakers. They left it to students to invite whom they wanted. It seems the students disagree about whether Ellenhorn’s speakers fell outside the norms of good taste established by the elected representatives of the community. I don’t think, for example, that other members of the USC Republicans in previous semesters have been punished in any way. If they had invited Avik Roy or Ramesh Ponnuru or Cindy McCain or whoever, I am sure no one would have cared. But that’s PRECISELY why Senator Ellenhorn didn’t invite someone like them. It’s not honest intellectual and political enquiry, it’s juvenile kids deliberately trying to get attention and rile people. It’s sad.
I should also add that USC Republicans made a very similar fuss when Angela Davis was invited to campus. These discussions go both ways when someone radical is invited to speak.
I will bet they did not blockade the entrance to the site nor did they blockade the road(s) leading to the event.
Who says their “norms” are relevant. I would guess that what would fall into their “norms” is whoever they agree with.
I doubt it. They don’t seem to have a problem with lots of speakers who they disagree with, including many conservatives. The martyr complex is very tiring.
Boy, is that the pot calling the kettle black! Ha Ha Ha HA.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You still need to make a point. You barging in and telling those of us in our community that we should run it the way YOU think smacks of authoritarianism. I don’t tell your church which sermon to use on a Sunday. You’d find it insulting. And you’re insulting USC with your nonsense here.
Just because he is a republican does not mean he is a conservative.  There is a difference, duh.
Sure. But he’s also a conservative.
Not by my definition.
Good for you. But this makes YOU sound like an elitist. And I don’t think this letter gives you very much ground for making a considered opinion on the matter. So again, I would look at yourself and seeing if you are emoting rather than thinking here. We’re trying to think through an issue, not representing a “team”.
If you consider the writer of this letter a “conservative” then what are you? While trying to impeach Lisa for “taking shots” at your sacred cows of young people and “Bernie Saunders” you ignore your own vitriol against Ellenhorn by claiming he has a “lack of nuance in his thinking” and God forbid how did he get into an academic school like USC.  Your just a liberal snob who thinks he is more intelligent than the people around you when the reality is your more likely thought a fool and you don’t realize it.
It’s “you’re”

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  
I have always been a really positive person, and I truly do believe that having a little faith can go a long way. Yet despite this optimism, I have never had much faith in long-distance relationships. After witnessing one of my high school friends struggle with her own long-distance relationship, I vowed to avoid putting myself in the same situation at all costs.
Three months later, I found myself in a happy relationship. Things were going great with us, and I was heading off to USC to start my freshman year. We had the entire summer left to be together, and I knew it would be pure bliss. Going into the relationship with him, I had promised myself that we would not do long distance so I could enter USC without any high school attachments. 
When the end of summer rolled around, I wasn’t really sure how I felt about long-distance anymore. Maybe we were different? Maybe we would be the lucky ones and could stand the test of long-distance? There was something so appealing about the idea of us having our separate lives at different schools and being able to share them with one another. 
Though I still had my hesitations, he promised me that we would make it work. He promised me that we would be together in the end and we would crush long-distance. And so, I decided to take my own advice and had a little faith, hoping it would take us through the four tumultuous years of college. Little did I know that this relationship would make me realize, at that time, I actually knew nothing about the importance of being treated in a way that I deserved. 
I remember how empty it felt saying bye to him the night before I left for USC. I was venturing into this new chapter of my life, and was terrified for what the future would hold. I was scared and nervous and excited all at the same time. But I knew having his support, even if it was many many miles away, would make a world of difference. 
At first, long distance was going pretty well; we promised we wouldn’t put our lives on hold to just run home and be able to Skype each other. We made time for each other, of course, but also ensured that we would not miss out on the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. I actually felt great going out knowing that there was someone who would do anything for me miles away. Unfortunately, this positive mindset didn’t last very long. 
It was really difficult when, at the end of a long day, all I wanted was a hug from my boyfriend, and instead I had to watch him through a computer screen. Then, after the first couple of weeks when school really started and our lives started to get really busy, we would go days without talking to each other. I guess when someone isn’t a part of your daily life it’s really easy to just cut them out. And so, long distance began taking its toll on our relationship. When we would talk, it wouldn’t be catching up on how our classes were, or what new organizations we had joined; it would be arguing about why he hadn’t reached out in so long or accusing each other of not caring about one another. He became really invested in his fraternity and other interests which were just so far from my own. I was in an extremely hard major, became really focused on school and joined various other organizations that consumed most of my time. 
On most days, I didn’t recognize the person he had become. I missed the old him, the guy that I fell in love with in high school. I missed the guy that would take me stargazing, the guy that I could talk to for hours on end. 
He was gone now, and it took me a really, really long time to come to terms with that. We dated for two and a half years –– out of those, one and a half were long distance. That is, before we broke up. I was heartbroken, and so was he. I think the hardest part of it was that we did nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong with being invested in your college experience, and there is nothing wrong with putting your love life on the backburner while trying to get your career and education in order. He didn’t do anything terrible and neither did I. It was just that instead of growing together, we grew apart. 
Even though I knew he had changed, I missed the old him and knew that he was in there somewhere. I was firmly convinced that the root problem of our breakup and the reason for him changing was due to the fact that for a majority of the year there were so many miles in between us. We were both spending that summer in our hometown, and though I didn’t admit it at the time, I was really excited to see him again and hoped that maybe he would revert back into his old self once there were no longer miles between us anymore. 
We hung out my very first night back at home, and it really did feel just like it did when we first started dating in high school. We fell back into our old ways that summer, knowing very well in the back of our minds that what we were doing was absolutely self-destructive. At that time, It didn’t matter to me because I had my old boyfriend back. That summer, we were essentially together without ever admitting it to each other.
I was falling more and more in love with him each day, and a part of me wanted to ask him to get back together, to give long distance a second chance after I saw just how good we were when we were in the same place. And so I mustered up the courage and told him how I felt. 
“Just because we have feelings for each other doesn’t mean we should act on it,” was his reply.  
Confused, I asked where this was coming from. He said he needed to enjoy his time and not to be tied to one girl during the best years of his life. College was his time to experiment and having a girlfriend would be an unnecessary burden on his life. I was truly heartbroken.
I returned back to USC my junior year with my heart in pieces; I was in love with someone who still had feelings for me but didn’t think I was worthy enough of his time to be in a relationship. Though I fully realized this at the time, it didn’t stop me from contacting him. 
Every time we were physically together, he was his old self, but things were always so different when I returned to USC. There was radio silence between us: he would never text me first and every time I gathered the courage to text him, he wouldn’t respond. I started hearing about girls that he was trying to get with and I confronted him about it. He would always say, “They mean nothing compared to you, I promise. You are the one I actually care about but I need to be able to have the full college experience.” 
In my mind, I concluded that if I acted less like me and tried to expect less of him, he would want me back and I would be “low maintenance” enough for him to care about me. So, I never tried to argue with him about what I thought was fair and what I was upset about. My friends continued to tell me how terrible he was, but I wrote them off as unable to understand the feelings we had for each other. 
This situation went on until this past winter break which was my final straw. Once again, we were in our hometown together but this time we barely saw each other. He stopped prioritizing me and would leave right after we hooked up. It became clear to me that he was no longer treating me right — he always had excuses for why he had to leave or why he was busy. It dawned on me: Why should I be the one to settle for his excuses? Why should I be the one who waits for him to decide that I am worthy of his time? 
At the beginning of this semester, I made solid effort to cut him out of my life for good and stopped any attempt to interact with him or even see him. The pain still reappears: Just recently, he texted me out of the blue simply to tell me that he had started seeing someone. At first, I was heartbroken, and it felt like we had broken up all over again. 
I wondered if I hadn’t cut him out of my life for the past couple of months, would we still be in our twisted version of a relationship? If we continued talking, would he have found someone else? But then I remembered that this changed nothing — it only confirmed how incompatible we were. Just because he was seeing someone else didn’t change the fact that we were completely different people now. It didn’t change the fact that for two years he treated me solely as a hook-up while he searched for someone physically closer to him. 
He asked if we could remain friends. I declined; I didn’t want his friendship. Perhaps the most important realization I had at that moment was that I do not owe him anything, especially my friendship. I am aware that some people feel the need to be friends with their former significant others, to stay true to what they were before they started dating. But it’s hard to stay friends with someone who is no longer there. The person that was my best friend before we started dating was long gone, as was the person that I dated. 
Today, we aren’t friends, we aren’t enemies — we’re just strangers with some great memories, and I’ve finally accepted that I can live with that.
