In their first game since publicly announcing that De’Anthony Melton will be unavailable for the rest of the season, the Trojans played with fire and fury on Sunday. Although they quickly trailed 6-0 to the Utah Utes (10-7, 2-4), the Trojans responded with a 10-0 run. After allowing a 3-point shot, which put the score at 10-9, USC then went on a 22-6 run and never relinquished its double-digit lead. The Trojans defeated the Utes, 84-67, but the game was effectively over at halftime with the Trojans up 46- 22.

Sophomore guard Jonah Mathews called this a “statement” game both about Melton and Utah. Prior to tonight, Utah had defeated USC in eight consecutive matchups dating back to 2012 when Kevin O’Neill was still USC’s head coach. 
“They were talking trash throughout the game about how we couldn’t beat them,” Mathews said, “… even when they were down 20.” 
Head coach Andy Enfield joked that USC’s losing streak came to an end because Utah’s best players are now in the NBA. The Utes wore “Kuzmania” warm-up shirts before tip-off, as if to send a message to the Trojans that alumnus Kyle Kuzma, now a Lakers rookie, runs Los Angeles. USC did not buy that message. 
“We tried to keep our composure and let the scoreboard talk for us,” Mathews said. 
In the midst of an up-and-down year, USC earned a decisive Pac-12 victory. 
“It was one of our best games so far,” redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron added. USC channeled the emotion into a phenomenal defensive effort, forcing 17 turnovers. 
“Our defense helped us get out to a lead and gave us confidence,” Enfield said. 
The Trojans committed only seven turnovers. The plus-10 turnover margin gave them 10 extra possessions throughout the game, effectively the cause for a double-digit scoring margin. USC also started red hot from beyond the arc, converting eight of its first 12 3-point attempts and finishing with a season-high 14 3-point shots made. Eight different players made 3-point shots. 
Another consequence of USC’s announcement that Melton is out for the year is that USC finally has its full roster available. Aside from Melton’s absence, earlier this season, USC missed sophomore guard Derryck Thornton for six weeks due to a shoulder injury and junior forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu with a suspension and ejection. Now, Enfield can be certain that the rotations he uses each night will be ones that should be available in March. He also has a lot of depth to draw upon. The Trojans scored 46 first-half points without having a single double-digit scorer. Mathews, who had 8 in the half, would end up leading the team with 17. Boatwright, who had only 2 points in the first half, finished with 13, and five other Trojans scored 9 or more points. 
After sweeping the Rocky Mountain schools, the Trojans are a 50-foot buzzer beater (at Stanford) away from being first place in the Pac-12. 
“It’s better to have your losses at the beginning,” Aaron said. He said he believes USC is still a national championship contender.
While USC has its full lineup, Boatwright and, especially, Metu appear at risk of garnering more suspensions. They each picked up a technical foul late in Wednesday’s game.
“We hope Chimezie can control his emotions and not hurt the team,” Enfield said. The star center’s energy is two-fold. While it gets him in trouble, it also motivates his teammates.
“When he is screaming, he gets us all fired up,” Aaron said. For USC and Metu, a high-intensity, smack-talking reputation could precede the team to their upcoming Pac-12 games. This, after Metu’s suspension at Washington State, his boisterous comments and Enfield’s late timeout at the end of the Colorado game, and a chippy technical for words directed at Utah’s Jayce Johnson. 
When asked if USC is developing a “bad boy mentality,” Enfield laughed and said, “I don’t see Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn in the locker room. We’re just trying to be USC basketball players.” 
If the smack-talk and chippy play continues, though, USC’s opponents might start to target the Trojans. In other words, they will circle USC games on their calendars and bring extra energy to those matchups. After all, Colorado coach Tad Boyle has already said that a victory against USC would be extra sweet given the FBI investigation into the program. 
That is not necessarily bad for USC, a team which tends to play toward its opponent’s energy. After all, less than one month ago, the Trojans lost at home to Princeton and Washington. 
Ferocity and smack-talking could be the mentality the Trojans require to finish off the season strong.

With so many players leaving the Trojans after the conclusion of this season, the team will have to find a way to make up for its losses. The beauty of college football is that the teams are constantly changing, leaving room for young players to prove their worth. These are the players who are likely to replace the eight departing starters from the Cotton Bowl.
As a freshman, running back Stephen Carr ran for 363 yards. In 2018, he will be tasked with replacing Ronald Jones II. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
The most intriguing question is who will take over for Sam Darnold under center. The obvious choice is redshirt freshman Matt Fink, the only other quarterback to see the field in the regular season. 
Fink came on in relief of Darnold at the end of USC’s 38-10 home victory over Oregon State in October and flashed signs of his ability. The 6-foot-3, 190-pound signal-caller showed he could be a dual-threat  with a 51 yard touchdown run. As far as throwing the ball, Fink completed six passes for 43 yards on the season.
If Fink disappoints heading into 2018, however, the Trojans have other options. Fink beat out freshman Jack Sears for the right to back up Darnold this season, and the two are likely to be in competition for the second year running. Sears, a four-star recruit, was the more decorated high school player (he played at the same school as Darnold), while Fink holds the strength of experience.
But even Sears’ lofty expectation are incomparable to those of incoming five-star freshman J.T. Daniels. 
Daniels, the number one pro-style quarterback in the class of 2019, decided to reclassify and enroll at USC with the class of 2018. Daniels, just 17 years old, is incredibly talented but will have to overtake his longer-tenured teammates in order to see playing time next season. Redshirt sophomore Thomas Fitts and redshirt freshman Holden Thomas fill out the competition as dark horse contenders.
The most seamless transition may come at the running back position. Even though the Trojans have to replace the fifth all-time rushing leader, Ronald Jones II, the team has a ready-made candidate in five-star freshman running back Stephen Carr. Carr impressed in his first two games in cardinal and gold, rushing for 69 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries against Western Michigan 119 yards against Stanford to begin the season. He finished his first season with 363 rushing yards and three touchdowns.
Although injuries hampered him for much of the year, Carr is expected to take on a major workload in 2018. Junior Aca’Cedric Ware and redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai should also see playing time, along with incoming four-star freshman Markese Stepp.
Although wide receiver Deontay Burnett was integral in 2017 as the Trojans’ number one receiver, there is a myriad of options to fill his void. Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. stepped up their games toward the end of the season, particularly when Burnett was held in check against Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game. 
In addition, Redshirt junior Jalen Greene should be back along with redshirt freshman Velus Jones Jr. and Josh Imatorbhebhe. Freshman Joseph Lewis IV and incoming recruit Amon-Ra St. Brown bring excitement to the receiver position as five-star talents. St. Brown played high school ball with Daniels.
Redshirt sophomore Cole Smith was backup to redshirt senior center Nico Falah, and would appear to have the inside track to the starting job next year. Smith will have to beat out redshirt junior Richie Wenzel, freshman Brett Neilon and incoming four-star freshman Justin Dedich, assuming head coach Clay Helton doesn’t move his other linemen around.
The loss of outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu stings, but it’s one of the positions the Trojans have plenty of talent at. Sophomore Jordan Iosefa played the position well on the other side from Nwosu after taking over for injured junior Porter Gustin, who is likely to take Nwosu’s spot.
If injuries rear their ugly head, Helton could turn to sophomores Oluwole Betiku Jr. and Connor Murphy.
With junior Rasheem Green declaring for the NFL Draft, USC faces a hole on the defensive line. 
Redshirt junior Malik Dorton and redshirt sophomore Christian Rector had their moments in 2017 and should find their way into the starting lineup. Redshirt freshman Liam Jimmons is another possibility.
Finally, the Trojans will have to continue without the presence of senior safety Chris Hawkins. This position is a bit shaky as the Trojans are young at safety; Hawkins’ backups were freshman Bubba Bolden and redshirt freshman C.J. Pollard. Both contributed on special teams in 2017.
There has been speculation that junior cornerback Iman Marshall will move over to safety to pair with junior Marvell Tell III. In that case, redshirt junior Ajene Harris and sophomore Jack Jones would form the starting cornerbacks, with junior Isaiah Langley as the nickel corner. Redshirt sophomore Ykili Ross also has playing experience at both the safety and cornerback positions. He recorded two interceptions in a utility role last year, including one against Cal which he returned for a 49-yard touchdown.

This past weekend, defensive tackle junior Rasheem Green declared for the 2018 NFL Draft. He is the first draft-eligible defensive player on the USC Football team to do so during this off-season.
Green’s departure leaves a major hole on the Trojans’ defense. Daily Trojan file photo.
The 6-foot-4 Los Angeles native made his presence felt on the defensive line, with 117 tackles, 16.5 sacks, a pair of blocked field goals and even a touchdown via a fumble recovery. Green announced his NFL declaration through Twitter on Jan. 13. 
“After a lot of careful thought and discussions with my family, trusted friends, and the USC coaching staff, I have decided to forgo my final year of eligibility at USC and enter the 2018 NFL Draft,” Green wrote in his tweet. Green also thanked those who have supported him throughout his football career.
“I wouldn’t be the player and person that I am without you guys,” Green said. “My three years at USC have been a blessing, and I am forever grateful for the people that I have encountered on this journey.”
These last few weeks, the USC Football team has lost a few significant members, including redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, junior running back Ronald Jones II and junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett. 
Despite the chain reaction of declarations that occurred after Darnold announced his decision, a few players elected to spend another year sporting the USC colors, including junior inside linebacker Cameron Smith. On Jan. 12, Smith’s junior defensive-mate Iman Marshall announced that he would remain a Trojan for another season. 
“I came to USC three years ago with big expectations for myself and for this University,” Marshall said. “[I] want to help bring this University back to the top and feel we got a lot more left to accomplish, time to go and get it!”
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound cornerback is known for his physical play-style that has resulted in 118 tackles, 17 deflections and six interceptions throughout his football career at USC. Without a doubt, the two returning veteran defenders, Smith and Marshall, will have to serve as leaders for a now offense-depleted Trojan Football team. 
Fellow defenders, redhsirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris and junior safety Marvell Tell III are also expected to return for their senior seasons.

A pair of strong victories over the weekend have helped stabilize the USC men’s basketball team after it underwent a bumpy start to Pac-12 competition this season.
Senior guard Elijah Stewart scored 9 points against Utah, going 3-for-4 from long range. Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
A 20-point scoring effort from senior guard Jordan McLaughlin propelled the Trojans past visiting Colorado on Jan. 10, 70-58. The victory over the Buffs was followed up by an 84-67 USC routing of Utah on Sunday, a game which saw the Trojans hit a season-high 14 3-pointers as a team.
USC’s (13-6) weekend sweep at the Galen Center improved it’s conference record to 4-2 this season and moved it into a tie for second-place with UCLA in the Pac-12 standings.
“Every game in our league is a challenging one this season — we’re in a very deep conference,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’re happy with how we played this past week. We beat two tough teams at home and we’ve been playing some good basketball.”
  The Trojans will look to extend their conference winning-streak to three games Thursday night, as they travel to Eugene to take on Oregon (12-6, 2-3). The Ducks, who are coming off a 90-83 loss to No. 14 Arizona, are led offensively by sophomore guard Payton Pritchard (who is averaging a team-high 15 PPG).
“We’ve been playing some good basketball, very well on the defensive side of things over the past five games,” Enfield said. “We know it’s going to take another good defensive effort from our guys to pick up a win at Oregon.”
 Pac-12 losses to Arizona (Jan. 13), Oregon State (Jan. 5) and Utah (Dec. 29) have dropped Oregon to a 2-3 record in conference play this season. The Ducks currently find themselves situated at eighth in the Pac-12 standings.
 USC was swept in its series against Oregon last season, losing both games in double-digit fashion. When the Trojans traveled to Oregon last season, they returned with an 84-61 blowout loss to the Ducks. USC has not won a road contest against Oregon since the 2008-2009 season.
“We’ve just got to show up and play some solid defense for an entire 40 minutes and knock down some shots,” McLaughlin, said. “It’s a little tough to be playing there, but then again every road game is tougher … If we can stick to playing fast, smart, unselfish, we should be in it.” 
McLaughlin, who leads the conference with 7.6 APG this season, is also averaging 13.2 PPG and has been the main offensive cog for the Trojans all season long. USC will look to McLaughlin to feed the other three Trojans scoring in double-figures this season: junior forwards Chimezie Metu (team-high 16.7 PPG) and Bennie Boatwright (15.4 PPG) and senior guard Elijah Stewart (10.9 PPG).
“[McLaughlin’s] a great leader for us, and it’s really showing on the court right now,” Metu said. “If you’re in the right place on the floor, he’ll find you. He’s a guy who will make the right pass 10 times out of 10.”
 After losing to Stanford back on Jan. 7 in the most devastating of fashions (allowing a 55-foot 3-pointer as time expired in regulation), USC has responded resiliently by racking up back-to-back conference victories, both by double digits.
After doing battle at Oregon on Thursday night, USC will proceed to play Oregon State (10-7, 2-3) in Corvallis on Saturday.
Following a rocky non-conference outing this season, USC will have another opportunity to continue its upward trek in the conference standings this weekend. A successful weekend sweep of the Oregon schools would have the Trojans flirting with the top spot in the Pac-12 standings.
“We’ve just got to take this road trip one game at a time,” McLaughlin said. “We’ll keep all our focus on [Oregon] first and see what goes from there.”

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
It was the news everyone expected, but no one wanted to hear: On Jan. 3, Sam Darnold announced he was leaving the Trojans for the NFL.
Adding insult to injury, the team’s next-best offensive players, wide receiver Deontay Burnett and running back Ronald Jones II, decided to leave as well just days later. They all leave gaping holes on an offense that ranked second in the Pac-12 for total yards this season.
Without their top passer, rusher and receiver, it may seem like the Trojans are doomed for next season. Many fans will expect a rebuilding year. They shouldn’t. 
In 2018, the popular phrase, “Defense wins championships,” will be put to the test, as USC fields one of the most experienced and talented defensive units in the nation. 
It all starts at linebacker. Perhaps lost in the shuffle of the Darnold, Jones and Burnett decisions was junior Cam Smith’s announcement that he is returning for his senior season. 
Projected to be a late-first to second-round draft choice, Smith’s decision to return for another year is a major coup for the USC coaching staff. He’s anchored the defense since arriving on campus in 2015, leading the Trojans in tackles for the past two years. No one knows defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s system quite like Smith. In the one half he’s missed all year, Western Michigan ran all over USC. It’s hard to imagine what an entire season without him would look like. 
Getting a team captain in Smith back is massive, but he’s hardly the only Trojan with experience left on the defense. Junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin also announced his intentions to come back for his senior year. He battled through toe and bicep injuries for most of 2017, but when healthy he has the potential to be a one-man wrecking crew. Over his career, he’s notched 14 sacks and 23 tackles for loss. Expect him to terrorize quarterbacks and solidify himself as a can’t-miss draft prospect in 2018. 
Sophomores John Houston Jr. (84 tackles, 1 interception) and Jordan Iosefa bolster the linebacking crew after improving by leaps and bounds this season. Losing outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu is a major blow, as he earned All-American buzz for his quietly excellent senior season. Still, the team may have his ideal successor in freshman Levi Jones. The lanky 6-foot-3, 220-pound Jones has the size to be an excellent pass rusher and the speed to drop back into coverage, not to mention an impressive NFL pedigree that practically predestines success.      
Pendergast possesses a rare mix of both star power and depth at the linebacker position. He might just blitz on every down. While that position is set, the secondary and defensive line both carry a few more question marks into next season.
With defensive end Rasheem Green declaring for the draft, the unit loses its primary disruptive force, but second-team all-Pac-12 teamer sophomore Christian Rector is coming back, along with junior tackle Malik Dorton. USC forced the sixth-most sacks in the country with 46 this year, and with most of the defensive line returning, that number should only increase. 
As far as defensive backs go, USC brings back sophomore Jack Jones (four interceptions in 2017) and juniors Ajene Harris (five career interceptions), Iman Marshall (six career interceptions) and Marvell Tell III (85 tackles and three interceptions in 2017). A move to safety would tremendously benefit Marshall who seems to have regressed during each year of his career, as he’s struggled to avoid pass interference calls. If the transition does indeed happen, the duo of Marshall and Tell would give opposing quarterbacks’ nightmares. 
The team’s offense will have plenty of question marks  regardless of who plays QB. Still , the team’s defense looks  like it’s capable of keeping the Trojans in every game on the schedule. 
The 2018 team may not be as flashy, or as exciting, as recent USC rosters, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be successful. Don’t call it a rebuilding year just yet.

After a week of several Norman Topping Student Aid Fund scholars, alumni, faculty members, Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government officials taking a stand against the University’s decision to remove the fund’s program director position, Provost Michael Quick addressed the changes in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Senior Sabrina Enriquez (right), freshman Jeremiah Robinson (center) and other Topping scholars walked to Bovard Auditorium to deliver a compilation of letters to Provost Michael Quick. Mahira Raihan | Daily Trojan
“I think [the response to the decision] really points to just how important the Topping program is [and] the value the alumni of the program and current Topping students feel about the program,” Quick said. “They feel like [the program] has changed their lives, and that’s absolutely wonderful, and now going forward, we want to have that same feeling by having even more students.”
According to Vice Provost of Undergraduate Programs Andrea Hodge, students have been meeting with her over the week to discuss the changes.
“There has been, and continues to be, a great outpouring of support from current and former students, alumni and others,” Hodge said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The input of the students, both in meetings and in writing, has been extremely helpful. I’m taking their suggestions under advisement.”
Though Quick praised the efforts of the Topping scholars, he declined to comment on the specifics behind the administration’s decision to eliminate program director Christina Yokoyama’s position or potential  changes in personnel and scholarship funding and distribution in the future. However, he said through future modifications to the overall structure of the Topping Fund, he plans to further support diversity and inclusion in the overall student population on campus.
“Not just undergraduate students, but graduate students … I think we haven’t done enough at the graduate student level … through the Topping Fund,” Quick said. “I think that we need more students and continue to have a program that is going to be valuable to students.”
With greater expansion in the Topping program, Quick said he hopes to increase experiential equity among students on campus.
“It’s great that students can come here, and that’s what is part of what [the Topping Fund] does, but I think another big piece of what we want to do with this University is to provide resources that allow students to have the same level of experiences as all of our students here at USC,” Quick said. “I think that’s another valuable piece that the Topping program and the money can help.”
The Topping Fund was founded in 1970 as a means for lower-income students to access a USC education.
According to Sabrina Enriquez, a senior Topping scholar studying mathematics who has been active in promoting the reversal of the elimination of Yokoyama’s position, this program is unique to the University.
“Topping was started in the 1970s by [alumni Ron McDuffie and Dan Smith], who saw that basically a very small percentage of students were coming from low-income backgrounds in nearby communities,” Enriquez said in an interview with the Daily Trojan on Jan. 5. “They saw this as a disservice to them.”
According to the Topping program’s website, as a response to the lack of diversity on campus, McDuffie and Smith issued a referendum that established a system “whereby every academic semester all students enrolled in more than one unit were assessed a nominal fee of $4.” This came to be known as the Topping Fund. 
“I think at that point, [the Topping Fund] really changed the conversation about what this University stands for and what the students at this University stand for,” Quick said. “I think it’s just one of the proudest moments to date. It really is one of those seminal moments that have come a long way.”
The Topping Fund, according to Quick, contributes to the overall diversity and inclusion of students on campus, which he said stands as “the forefront of where we want to go with this University.”
Additionally, according to Enriquez, the program is also student-led and student-funded, which is unlike any other organization on campus and the only one of its kind in the country. The program is headed by the Topping Governing Board, on which several scholars and alumni are represented. 
“It’s essentially this body that gets together to direct the program,” Enriquez said. “They vote on how the money is to be used, how much scholarship funds will be distributed per student and how many students they will accept. They really shape the program.”
In an attempt to maintain the student-run nature of the Topping Fund, members of the fund delivered a letter on Tuesday compiled with articles from the Daily Trojan and several other letters penned by the Topping Governing Board, scholars and faculty to the Provost’s office at USC Bovard Auditorium. 
The letter was intended to inform Quick about the collective efforts of the program from the past week. 
“The letter details why [Yokoyama’s] position is pivotal for the success of the Topping Student Aid Fund as well as its scholars and how terminating that position is directly attacking some of the most endangered students on the campus,” said senior David Delgado, a Topping scholar majoring in gender studies and theatre. Delgado helped with penning the letter that was delivered to the provost on Tuesday.

With only 24 hours at hand, seniors Cherrie Wang and Brandon Cen and alumni Izzy Benavente and Jason Lin did not expect to leave the Facebook Global Hackathon with the respect of major businesses and a tangible product with the capacity to contribute to the future of technology.
Seniors Cherrie Wang and Brandon Cen and alumni Izzy Benavente and Jason Lin worked on an app at the Facebook Global Hackathon that made use of virtual reality simulations. Photo courtesy of Cherrie Wang.
The USC team received the third-place prize at the hackathon last November with their app Cue, a virtual reality simulation that targets gender bias in the workplace.
Alongside Benavente and Lin, Wang and Cen, who are both majoring in computer science, created three scenarios to educate users about bias that exists in the workplace.
The team originally went to the hackathon with the intention of addressing gender inequality in the workplace through their project. However, due to time constraints, they had to water down their focus to the kinds of unconscious biases that lead to gender and racial inequalities in the workplace instead.
“When you Google ‘VR feminism’ or ‘a woman’s perspective from VR,’ you just get a lot of porn, and that’s really disappointing as someone who is a woman and has heard a lot about workplace sexism and bias,” Wang said. “Ideally, we would’ve liked to build a perfect simulation of what it’s like to be a woman who’s harassed in the workplace or told [her] work is not as good because [she] doesn’t look like a man… but we scaled it down to focus on things [that are] conceptually easier for people to digest and easier for us to build.”
According to Wang, the team chose to focus on virtual reality specifically due to flaws in the typical bias training a company requires: a video or PowerPoint that can be easily ignored or forgotten. Instead, the value of mixing virtual reality with the training was that it added an immersive, 3-D platform, and it hadn’t been done before. Additionally, Wang said VR can be offered anywhere and is becoming more accessible.
Wang said that while working on the project, the team did not realize how much human biases can be internal as well. Wang had Cen describe two people: Dan, his mentor, and Alice, his boss. 
“When Brandon was describing Alice, she was really nurturing, very supportive, a great teacher … When he was talking about Dan, he was intelligent, a leader,” Wang said. “They’re both very capable sophomore engineers, but he just associated the terms ‘leader’ and ‘charismatic’ with Dan, and Alice was just a supporting role. Seeing a very clear cut difference even with our own perception of bias got the ball rolling on how we would craft these scenarios.”
Out of the three choices, users can select a scenario. The first scenario is an illustration of the surgeon’s dilemma. Originally, the surgeon’s dilemma is a riddle that plays on people’s assumption that a surgeon must be male. In the app, they addressed a name bias; for instance, a gender-neutral name might be interpreted as male in the context of the words “engineer” or “doctor.”
“Our first scenario dealing with gender bias came from the common discrepancy of female engineers pretty much in every tech company today,” Cen said. “Especially [because of] ‘the Google memo’ that blew up in the tech community this past summer, gender bias was the first subject we wanted to tackle.”
In the next option, the app will ask the user to verbally describe a coworker. After a certain amount of time, those words will form a word cloud around the user. Seeing the words used to describe the opposite gender is an immersive, visual learning experience about unconscious bias.
“You can see what you’ve been saying, and if I saw words like ‘powerful’ and ‘driven,’ I’d feel like those are words not usually used to describe me,” Wang commented. “Likewise, if you had been saying bad things about your coworkers, that would show up around you.”
Finally, there is a conversation between coworkers about candidates for a job opening. Though described with equal qualifications and strengths, one will be old while the other young.
“This is a clear example of ageism,” Wang said. “As young people, we like to think we’re better; we think faster and know how to use technology, so we should hire the young person. It takes a lot to stand up to the recruiter and say though they may be older, they have a lot they can bring to the table as well.”
At the hackathon, the projects were presented to judges in an expo-style set up. The top five received the opportunity to live stream their creations to the world through Facebook. Afterwards, awards were distributed. The USC team won third place and received $2,500 overall and each an Oculus Rift developer kit each. 
“One of the most validating moments was that the co-founder of Occulus was there,” Wang said. ”When he presented us the prize he said, ‘I think that one day in the future all training of this nature will be in VR.’ That’s a really big statement… For our app, while it was a small, tiny piece of the universe, it’s important for us to start thinking in that direction. How can VR be used that’s not just sitting in a roller coaster or simulating porn?”
Wang encourages students to begin attending hackathons as a way to gain both experience and professional connections. 
“It’s hard to feel like you have a lot of tangible skill,” Wang said. “As a freshman when I went to my first hackathon, HackSC, I literally knew nothing… I didn’t really think about working on projects but really going to learn and absorb the experience. It’s because of all those times not knowing what I was doing, later on I could go in with a game plan.”
Furthermore, Wang believes that by winning hackathons, students are representing USC well.
“At USC, I think there is a very strong sense of an entrepreneurial community and culture here, and it’s really powerful,” Wang continued. “USC really has changed in the past couple of years to embrace this making, hacking culture which is really important for Viterbi as a school and us as a campus. At hackathons, there are tons of recruiters; if you build something really good, you’ve got your foot in your door.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate will vote next week on a resolution to distribute free menstrual products in women’s restrooms and gender-neutral restrooms across campus. 
A USG meeting. Photo by Catherine Liang | Daily Trojan
USG’s Director of Wellness Affairs Marina Hrovat, who introduced the resolution to USG on Tuesday, co-wrote the resolution with Senator Debbie Lee.
While the Engemann Student Health Center currently provides free menstrual products, Lee and Hrovat emphasized the inaccessibility of these products in their resolution. 
“The current university effort to supply these products to students is provided through Engemann Student Health Center, which is distant on campus, ultimately failing to meet the immediate need of students,” They wrote in the resolution.
Hrovat and Lee also noted that menstrual products are taxed as luxury items when purchased in stories, increasing the financial burden on students who need menstrual supplies.
“We realized that there are a lot of universities that are stepping up and taking care of this financial burden,” Marina Hrovat said. 
Lee cited Brown, Princeton and Stanford as universities that provide useful frameworks for a USC program.
In November, Hrovat organized a week-long trial run of free menstrual products with the help of Paula Swinford, director of the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion. According to Hrovat, the products were installed in restrooms in buildings like the Gwynn Wilson Student Union and Mark Taper Hall of Humanities. 
Following their trial run, Hrovat and Swinford received positive student feedback. 
“We used a texting survey to measure student feedback,” Marina Hrovat said. “We had 99 percent full support from students who were participating in that texting-in survey. And we used a substantial amount of products that were put out for the week.”
With several students supporting the need for free menstrual products in the women’s and gender-neutral restrooms, Hrovat said that the next step for this initiative is deciding on a supplier for the feminine hygiene products. 
While the University will be paying for the menstrual products, Hrovat is looking to contract a specific supplier so that there will be no “roadblock of having to change or switch the supplier company.” 
Currently, Hrovat has been in communication with two suppliers. She and Lee are meeting with Tampon Tribe, a tampon supplier, next Tuesday with hopes of a potential partnership with USC.
Hrovat said her goal is to have the products in restrooms by the beginning of Fall 2018. Since there has been a lot of urgency on the University’s end, a supplier will be chosen soon.
“[The initiative]’s moving quickly — there’s a lot of support, there’s a lot of urgency, so I don’t believe this will take long to accomplish because there is so much support,” Hrovat said. “Companies work at their own speed. We can do our best, but it’s a two-way deal.”
Juliana Hrovat, parliamentarian for the legislative branch of USG and Marina’s sister, said that while it is normally challenging to have the University allocate the funds to pursue it, installing these products into campus restrooms is a matter of lending equal access to all students. 
“I think this initiative is extremely important for all women on this campus because it provides them with the resource that maybe some students on this campus aren’t able to get,” Juliana Hrovat said. “Giving all students access to this … will really help the female population at USC.”

The plan to renovate the Coliseum was announced in 2016. The renovations kicked off this year, with completion of the Coliseum projected in 2019 by the home opener game. 
“We are extremely grateful to Julia and George Argyros and their family for this wonderful display of generosity and support of USC Athletics,” USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann said in a press release. “This gift will ensure the Coliseum remains a world-class facility not only for Trojan student-athletes, but also for Olympians and other sportsmen and sportswomen, as well as for all Southern Californians to enjoy.”
The renovation layouts are based on the peristyle from the 1932 Olympic Games. The renewed stadium will contain a variety of architectural features such as arches and columns.
Along with the installed peristyle, the renovation includes fixing the limestone tiles and redoing the murals under the arches. In addition, USC hopes to improve the Coliseum by modernizing the venue with a new south side amenity that includes suites, loge boxes, club seats and an additional press box. 
“Through their generous support of the restoration of the Coliseum, Julia and George Argyros ensure that this historic structure will remain a treasure for the USC community, the nation and even the world for generations to come,” said President C. L. Max Nikias said in a press release. 
Julia and George Argyros are also active within Orange County businesses and community service organizations. They advocate for giving back to the community by donating time and money to improve conditions for the less fortunate. 
The Argyroses have aspired to increase the quality of living within their community by volunteering and working with organizations and schools such as Girl Scouts, Alzheimer’s Association, Chapman University and Orange County School of the Arts. 
George Argyros has held the position of a U.S. Ambassador for Spain and Andorra, served for the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation and is currently the CEO of Arnel & Affiliates. 
Julia Argyros, on the other hand, is well known for her activism within the philanthropic community. She has held a variety of leadership roles with organizations, such as the South Coast Repertory and Segerstrom Center for the Arts. 
George and Julia Argyros hope to continue giving back to their community through the Argyros Family Foundation. 
“On behalf of our entire family, we are very excited to have the opportunity to participate in the renovation of this beautiful and iconic stadium,” Julia and George Argyros said in a press release. “The Coliseum means so much to the Trojan Family and the residents of Southern California. This gift reflects our belief in supporting important institutions that have an impact across communities.”

GRAMMY Award-winning musician Wyclef Jean’s journey from the villages of Haiti to acclaimed international superstar has been nothing short of remarkable, and it’s still far from over. Jean will embark on his first U.S. tour in over 10 years in less than a month, but on Thursday he stopped by Carson Center at USC to reminisce about how far he has come with USC Thornton School of Music students.
After talking about his 20-year career, Jean picked up the guitar for an acoustic rendition of “Hendrix” before performing “Killing Me Softly with His Song” with USC Thornton students. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“I’m not even from the hood, I’m from a hut,” Jean joked. “People in the projects [are] soft to me.”
Jean’s sense of humor as well as his ever-present desire to look to the future has closely associated him  with some of the modern music industry’s most notable artists, such as Avicii and Young Thug. Meanwhile, the laundry list of accolades that follow his name give many artists reason to cite him as an influence as well, dating all the way back to his seminal work with the Fugees and spanning his 20-year solo career featuring numerous high-profile collaborations. 
Jean talked at length about his experience in the studio with some of music’s brightest icons, such as the theory lesson he learned when trying to tell Whitney Houston that she had hit a flat note while recording “My Love is Your Love.”
“She was like, ‘The note’s not flat, baby, I bent the note,’” he said. “And then when I listened back, she actually did bend the note, like you would bend the note on a guitar. Once again, I learned a lesson: chromatic scales are relative. We could say dorian, ionian, phrygian, all the scales we want, but it’s all relative to the time when the action is about to happen, it can change at any second.”
After enlightening the crowd with insightful knowledge and interesting stories, Jean treated the audience to a brief performance, singing and strumming an acoustic rendition of “Hendrix” before collaborating with various Thornton students to perform the classic Fugees track “Killing Me Softly With His Song.”
After the event, Jean elaborated on many of his talking points, such as the importance of patience when creating music according to one’s own terms. Jean realized this sentiment when he released the song “Diallo,” a tribute to Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea who was shot 41 times by New York police officers in 1999. The song didn’t initially have the impact Jean was anticipating in America, but on a trip to Nigeria he saw how the song had touched thousands on the other side of the globe, reminding him that as long as he stayed true to his passion, the appreciation would come.
“I landed at the airport and looked out the window, and there were 100,000 people out there, and I was like, ‘Is Michael Jackson on this plane?’” he said. “And then I looked again, and there were signs that said ‘Diallo’ on them. It made me understand the purpose, like ‘We’re not just making music for 50 states anymore, we’re doing it for the world.’ That just boosts your morale, I just gotta keep going.” 
More than the record sales and critical recognition, Jean strives to have a monumental, tangible impact on the world of music that will outlast his career itself. In his eyes, success can only be defined by leaving a generation of music that “defines time and space,” and can remain relevant in an industry that is constantly abuzz with new sounds and artists.
Moderated by Tim Kobza, a USC Thornton faculty member, Jean told stories about working with top artists such as Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, and stressed the importance of copyrighting original work in the age of streaming. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“When you hear Michael Jackson, it doesn’t matter if ‘Billie Jean’ was done in the ’80s or now; when you hear Wyclef’s ‘Maria, Maria,’ it doesn’t matter if it’s now or then,” Jean said. “We say we don’t write hits, we write cultural phenomenons. You can do one song or two songs, but can you actually move the needle to where you inspire the generation that comes after you?”
Truly a man motivated by his own legacy, Jean wants to be remembered as someone who stood for more than just music, evidenced in his many social justice efforts as well as his 2010 bid to be president of Haiti. Along with his commitment to using his platform to spark change, he plans to build and market the first hip-hop guitar, and aims to debut the product in a year and a half.
“How many guitar players have we had in our generation that have made guitars so famous?” he asked. “We can keep counting and counting, but all we really know is Fender, Les Paul, nothing different. So I’m excited that I’m going to be the first to invent the hip-hop guitar, I’m going to show you guys how I built it, and do music with it and everything.”
When the renowned producer finally elects to call it a career, expect his list of achievements outside of the studio to be as robust as his eclectic musical catalogue. Still, less than a year after concluding his Carnival album trilogy with Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee last September, Jean is gearing up for another project, a mixtape titled Wyclef Jean Goes Back to School.
Jean plans to visit about 25 college campuses while working on the mixtape, recording material in the dormitories alongside some of the brightest young minds in music. Moira MacKesey-Green, a senior majoring in popular music, and Kyle Merrill, a senior majoring in music industry, both impressed Jean with striking performances during the forum in Carson Center, and the artist now plans to return to USC for the students’ help in making the mixtape a reality.
“Coming here and vibing with the little homies, this is definitely going to be one of the schools,” he said. “The artists, the singers, forget about it.”

Yet, with physics-defying flying carpets, desert caves dripping with gold and magical lamps, the story of Aladdin (Adam  Jacobs), a street urchin whose life is magically transformed in an instant, becomes a bewitching experience complete with sing-along music, courtesy of Disney.
Now as a musical production at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre, Aladdin enchants and transports audiences to the magical land of Agrabah, as soon as the larger-than-life Genie (Michael James Scott) breaks the fourth wall to address the audience: “You’ve never been [to Agrabah]? Well, we can fix that!” 
The orchestra crescendos and Genie launches into the familiar melody of “Arabian Nights,” accompanied by a diverse cast in dazzling costumes as well as sparkling set productions that breathe life into the stage. Agrabah, and likewise the Aladdin production, have “more glitz and glamour than any fictional city in the world,” as promised by Genie. 
The sets, created by set designer Bob Crowley, move seamlessly in and out of the audience’s vision, forming the breathtaking backdrop for Aladdin’s journey. From the crowded town marketplace where Aladdin makes his first escapade in “One Jump Ahead” to the shimmering Cave of Wonders with its foreboding green eyes, the stage design delivers Disney’s fairytale vision to life on the stage.
As Aladdin enters the Cave of Wonders at the bidding of the villainous Jafar (Jonathan Weir) and his parrot-turned-human sidekick Iago (Reggie de Leon), golden icicles, smoke and bejeweled towers slide into view to serve as the decadent backdrop to Genie’s “Friend Like Me” performance.
Genie appears with dramatic flair and a hint of smoke, and his booming personality lights up the stage for the rest of the show, as he enthuses the audience with sass and light-hearted humor. With every “Can your friends do this?” uttered by Genie, dancers emerge to create a spectacle that reveals the extent of his magical talents. Red-suited waiters prop up full dishes of food, glitzy showgirls materialize from stationary props and a cymbal-crashing finale with golden baton-twirling tap dancers lead to a roaring ovation in the theatre.
Despite all the glamour, composer Alan Menken’s familiar score is what sets the tone of the musical as it did for the film, pacing each revelation and character interaction. New musical numbers were specifically composed by Menken to provide depth into characters’ internal commentary.
Aladdin performs a wistful solo in “Proud of Your Boy” after his marketplace shenanigans, revealing a deeper introspection beyond his mischievous facade to become a man his deceased mother and father would be proud of. 
Meanwhile, Jasmine (Isabelle McCalla) confides her feminist desires to escape to the outside world in “These Palace Walls” to her royal staff of women, who have replaced Rajah the tiger from the animated film. 
Aladdin’s original monkey sidekick, Abu, has also been switched out for a band of three mischievous “blood brothers” who aid Aladdin in his endeavors. Babkak, Omar and Kassim served as comedic entertainment and often as extras to Aladdin’s venture; however, their bravery was highlighted in an act of brotherhood leading to their ultimate capture by palace guards. 
The two-hour musical, although longer than the film, entertains and visually draws the audience into the tale. However, it barely scratches the surface of Jasmine and Aladdin’s romance, the tricky defeat of Jafar or Genie’s affinity for Aladdin (who he fondly refers to as Al). 
Still, the love for a happily-ever-after ending overcomes these plot-related questions for audiences seeking to enjoy the show. So, when Aladdin and Jasmine soar up across a twinkling night sky on a magic carpet singing a gentle rendition of “A Whole New World,” their joy and satisfaction is emulated by the audience in this visually stunning scene. 
“Hold your breath, it gets better,” Aladdin sings, and truly, the family-friendly production presents the audience with a hundred thousand things to see, while ending on a fulfilling, triumphant note for love.

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
If you were gunning for Kitty Corner Season 2, rife with more juicy sob stories about my attempts to contend with my identity, my ambivalence toward actualization and my wildly spiraling emotional instability, well then, I’m sorry to disappoint.
Last semester, I noticed a woeful lack of literary content within the Daily Trojan Lifestyle section. The last book review we published was in our summer orientation issue, and it was Indian Ink, a recommendation from USC President C. L. Max Nikias’ suggested summer reading list. On the flip side, just to give you a basis for comparison, we publish at least one album review each week, often more. 
Yes, I get it, no college student has the time or inclination to read but everyone listens to music. But the intensity of devotion that other people have toward their favorite songs and artists, the passion with which they defend their predilections, how central music is to their individuality and sense of self — it’s analogous to how I feel about literature. The way people judge others for their music taste, I judge people based on their favorite books. And if you don’t have a favorite book because you haven’t picked one up since The Giver in sixth grade? Well, we probably don’t have a ton in common. 
So instead, this semester, I’m making a conscious effort to fill a perceived void. According to several trustworthy sources, book recommendations are “boring” and “too safe,” but cut me some slack; there are only so many angsty topics I can draw from that are meaningful to me. Plus, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to show off my impeccable taste in literature, if I do say so myself. 
So what’s the critical inaugural novel? What book is so important to me, so influential on my penchants and proclivities, that it’s the first title that jumps to mind? 
Since this column will, sooner or later, expose me as the pretentious piece of shit that I am, I figure I may as well come out swinging and recommend Infinite Jest for my first piece. Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and confirm everyone’s suspicions that I am, in fact, That Asshole. 
Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace, is a behemoth of a book that defies explanation. It’s widely considered to be a Great American Novel, joining the ranks of Moby Dick, Lolita and To Kill a Mockingbird, and was a massive commercial and critical success when it first came out in 1996. 
The book weaves several storylines together, but most of the action revolves around a cartridge called Infinite Jest, which contains a film so mesmerizing that anyone unlucky (or perhaps lucky) enough to catch a glimpse of it instantly elects to spend the rest of their days in a euphoric stupor, at the expense of their biological obligations, until expiration follows not long after. So yeah, you can see how this premise might beget some provocative material. 
Infinite Jest is not my favorite novel, not by a long shot. It’s a little too maximalist, a little too stuffed with flourishes and fanfare, for my more pared-down palate. Plus, the sheer act of reading it is a goddamn headache, since half the book is just an extensive footnotes section for the other half. Exasperated readers have resorted to ripping the book apart to expedite the process of flipping back and forth between pages. 
But when I first read the novel in December of my high school junior year, it triggered a paradigm shift in how I thought about words, writing and narratives. I realized how fun it can be to play with language, stringing together sentences and magically conveying complex concepts with some squiggly lines. When I finished the book and and commenced staring at the ceiling for an hour, I could feel my mind churning, could hear my heartbeat pulsing in my ears. I felt as if I had been turned inside out and all the raw blood and flesh and sinews were now exposed to the chilled winter air — a singular sensation that I have yet to experience with any other book.

When singer Camila Cabello announced her departure from the popular girl group sensation Fifth Harmony, fans were questioning what she would do with her career. Could she hold up on her own? Would her popularity remain as strong as before? She made promising solo music, such as a placement on Machine Gun Kelly’s “Bad Things” and a few singles she released on her own, but they weren’t enough to confirm her strong foundation as a solo artist. 
Her first studio album since departing the girl group Fifth Harmony, Camila gives a more personal glimpse into the life of Camila Cabello, while showing a singer who still has some room for improvement. Photo courtesy of Epic Records.
At best, they were glimmers of a possibility, and at worst, they were not commercially successful and did not “feel or sound like [Cabello],” according to her manager Roger Gold. However, after one Billboard record-tying single and a string of live performances, the former Fifth Harmony member has finally released her self-titled debut solo album Camila, marking her first step toward an exciting solo career.
Cabello exhibits her raw vocals on the album’s first song, “Never Be the Same,” which reverberates in the listener’s ears along with its pulse-pounding drum beats. Cabello supposedly spent only an hour writing the song, but it vividly captures the “intoxicating and reckless” feeling of falling in love and being forever affected by it.
Cabello’s single “Havana,” which has already been certified double platinum in the United States, has been played on loop in radio stations worldwide. With Cabello’s sharp vocals and a rhythmic salsa melody, the Pharrell Williams-produced song seduces listeners to fall under its infectious spell and takes them to Cabello’s hometown of Havana, Cuba. This song, along with its music video, was the first indicator that Cabello was “Miss Movin’ On” and made the right decision to leave Fifth Harmony.
Two other notable songs on the album are “Consequences” and “Real Friends.” The first song uses delicate piano keys to create a quiet, yet moving atmosphere, as Cabello reflects on a relationship that left her in pain. She discusses undergoing weight loss as she dealt with problems in the relationship and life — “loving you had consequences.” She goes from thinking that loving her unnamed man was “young and wild and free” to accepting that their love was “dumb, dark and cheap.”
In “Real Friends,” a graceful acoustic guitar accompanies Cabello’s singing as she looks for friends who won’t deceive her. With both songs sharing similar broad ideas but touching on different situations and people, the singer shows her ability to tackle multiple forms of loss and gracefully express her feelings toward them.
The rest of Camila is filled with average songs that are propelled by Cabello’s vocals and unique instrumentals. As impressive as these attributes are, they’re not enough to make the songs worth listening to on repeat. 
Some songs had potential but the presence of both impressive and irritating qualities prevented the songs from becoming truly great. In “She Loves Control,” Cabello delivers a fierce chorus that evens out the loud cacophony of the instrumentals. However, therein lies the problem. The drumbeat could be considered way too loud and annoying for some listeners, and it may deter them from listening to the track again.
This is why Cabello’s debut solo album is just a first step towards a promising solo career as opposed to a standalone success, as the majority of the album does not retain the impressive quality of the earlier tracks like “Never Be the Same” or “Havana.”
However, the album demonstrates how much she has matured as a person and singer since her departure from Fifth Harmony. Her decision to not include her first few singles reveals her commitment to a cohesive project, as the tracklist is consistent with the album’s themes. 
Though she had originally planned to name her first studio album The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving, she later changed the album’s name to to Camila. In an interview with Genius, Cabello explained that she didn’t want the album to refer to hurtful experiences with others. Instead, she wanted the album to be about her, showing that she was willing to let go of a moment that left her in tears, and move on.
In hindsight, it’s commendable that Cabello released this album, as she clearly shows some personal growth from the loss she experienced during the past year. The fact that the album debuted at number 1 in over 100 countries certainly reflected the immense anticipation for the project, but the quality was not entirely reflective of this hype. This shouldn’t be seen as a travesty, however; she has shown significant improvement since the obnoxious single “Crying in the Club,” and her future work could continue to trend upward.
At the very least, this album showed that Cabello can stand on her own, independent of Fifth Harmony, as she begins a new chapter in not only her musical career, but also in her life.

When California Gov. Jerry Brown released his budget plan for 2018-19, one of the proposals he made was launching California’s first fully online public community college. Brown proposed allocating $120 million to open the college as soon as fall 2019.
Art by Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
Brown’s move is commendable — and his history as an advocate for online education is important — but it should also serve as a wake-up call for universities like USC to build web-based college courses that are as comprehensive and effective are traditional classroom courses.
Today, a college education is becoming an increasingly important requirement for individuals seeking secure, full-time employment. A growing number of middle-class jobs require specific skills and training that a basic high school education cannot provide.
In California, about 2.5 million 25-to 34-year-olds’ highest educational attainment is high school or some college, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Even more strikingly, just fewer than half of those 2.5 million adults are Latinx, reflecting a glaring racial disparity in educational attainment. 
It’s easy to suggest that these adults should have gone to a traditional college, or still can, but the economic reality of going to college makes it nearly impossible for many. College tuition costs continue to rise, and most of the time, pursuing a college education requires dedicating the same amount of time a full-time job requires, if not more. And often, hidden costs of attending college as an adult can be inhibiting factors — things like paying for childcare or commuting to a university on a daily basis.
Universities like USC should be at the forefront of innovation in online education programs, not just offering them. When an institution like USC invests its resources in online education, it’s reasonable to say that the web-based systems used to teach online will improve at a faster rate, while community college programs don’t have the same resources to raise grades and completion rates quickly enough.
Currently, USC doesn’t offer any undergraduate online courses, and the graduate programs they do offer are largely inaccessible to a demographic that only has a high school or partial college education.
In a 2010 Daily Trojan article, USC officials said they had no plans offer online courses because they want their students to have a comprehensive college experience — one that is not just educational, but social and cultural as well.
Analyzing the general issue, 80 percent of the aforementioned 2.5 million adults are working Californians — to go to college would mean losing all or part of their income while being expected to spend even more money paying for college.
Online education programs provide a better alternative. Students are able to pursue their education at their own pace, fit classes into their work schedules rather than try to work part-time jobs around in-person classes during the day and pursue programs that are much more affordable for working adults.
But despite the convenience and affordability of an online education, it’s reasonable to be wary of how effective taking a class via a computer is, in comparison to in-person learning. And studies in the past have suggested that online education is much less effective than its traditional counterpart.
In a 2015 study of 217,000 state community college students conducted by UC Davis, researchers found that students who took online courses from 2008 to 2012 got lower grades and lower course completion rates than students who took the same classes in traditional classrooms.
But this fact isn’t a problem inherent to the college education being online — it’s more reflective of the relatively new nature of web-based learning programs. With any education program, improvement comes over time. It’s foolish to expect online programs to be as effective as learning methods that have been improved upon for decades, if not centuries.
And we’re seeing that kind of improvement in newer online college education statistics. According to California Community Colleges executive vice chancellor Laura Hope, while only half of students completed online courses during the 2005-06 school year, in 2015-2016, nearly two-thirds of students completed online courses. For comparison, traditional classes at the state community college level have a completion rate of 71 percent, a number that has remained steady in the last decade.
It’s true the college experience is a beneficial one — but it’s one largely designed for students who have the economic privilege to go to college after high school, while the 2.5 million adults left behind are not looking for a college experience, but for the essential training they need to attain skill-based jobs that require a college education.
Currently, few private institutions offer online undergraduate classes  — out of the top 30 online bachelor’s programs as ranked by U.S. News and World Report, only seven of the online programs were offered by private colleges. Even fewer colleges on the list are major universities that have made names for themselves as traditional higher education institutions.
But the ones that do offer online programs have been largely successful. George Washington University offers online bachelor’s programs in health sciences and nursing, and certificate programs in fields ranging from legal studies to educational development.
GWU’s online education costs substantially less than its in-person education — students pay $5,000 per semester plus $570 per credit. Comparatively, tuition at GWU is $26,717 per semester. And the quality of their online programs is strong as well — U.S. News gave it a score of 85 out of 100, compared to 61 out of 100 for GWU’s traditional bachelor’s program.
USC and other private institutions should follow GWU’s example and provide their own online programs that make education more accessible, and to make online learning programs more innovative and effecient.
As educational institutions, USC and other similar colleges have the responsibility to make higher education as inclusive as possible. They can do so by providing online college courses and building curriculum and web programming designed to make online learning as effective as possible. Such can change the lives of millions of adults who’ll be able to pursue well-paying jobs as a result.

C’s may get degrees, but for California’s educational system, a C-minus rating ranks its schools the 10th worst in the nation. With ongoing discussions over underfunded UCs, the role of charter schools and disparities among school districts, there remains little disagreement over the sorry state of education in the Golden State. The questions that then arise center around sources of funding, curriculum and, most importantly, the tension between oversight and autonomy of school districts.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Budgets often represent a reflection of values, and in California Gov. Jerry Brown’s latest budget released this week, education spending makes a big splash. Brown calls for “fully funding the Local Control Funding Formula, his landmark 2013 overhaul of education financing that was designed to direct substantial amounts of extra money to schools with high numbers of low-income students.” This translates to $3 billion more arriving two years earlier to these institutions.
Yet there is a persistent criticism of the Local Control Funding Formula that must be considered: The use of cash with a “no strings attached” philsophy often leads to confusion and wastefulness.
The question that remains is where this money will end up. Brown stipulated that this money must be used to benefit students, but this vague guideline, in the absence of more concrete state goals, runs the risk of funding teacher pensions or unnecessary raises instead of investing in the students themselves. In fact, Los Angeles Unified School District recently settled a case in which plaintiffs accused it of misusing these funds.
Despite concerns over bureaucratic overreach, there must be a fine line drawn in the sand between guidelines and independence to ensure that money reaches the students and schools continue to innovate and create. 
USC, though privately funded and not subject to the whims of state bureaucrats, still holds a stake in this debate.
For one, early education intervention and advancement remains crucial to securing a steady and strong pipeline of California scholars to add to the ranks of Trojans. As a large, wealthy research university in a city and state characterized by extreme inequality, USC remains instrumental in recruiting and developing Californian students who can contribute to this state and society. The decisions and priorities of school districts, especially the ones that serve primarily underrepresented populations, shape the college readiness of millions of students, holding grand implications for preserving and expanding diversity in higher education. 
USC prides itself on its expansive outreach efforts to low-income students, as it houses the highest number of Pell Grant-eligible students among most other private, highly selective universities, and through developing and expanding opportunity in early education, these numbers can continue to grow.
Additionally, as a university that invests heavily in the local community and school districts, USC can and must shape the discussion around promoting educational opportunities and advancement. Through its Family of Schools, Neighborhood Academic Initiative and other outreach and college prep programs, USC proves that early and sustained intervention, rather than merely more funding, paves the way to greater educational equality and opportunity. 
For instance, among the variety of community programs that USC has to offer is the Center for Urban Education. Partnering with the Rossier School of Education, the center conducts research targeted at the K-12 age group with the goal of improving educational standards for students of color in higher education.
Another particularly helpful  organization launched by USC is the “I AM Program,” which pairs underrepresented youth with graduate students who act as college guidance mentors. Given California’s high school counselor-to-student ratio of 1:800 fails to meet the recommended state standard of 1:230, the program is an example of USC’s ability to fill the educational gap that currently exists in the California school system.
This coupling of college readiness initiatives with human and capital investment in K-12 schools represents a model for school districts and California, to follow when considering how to allocate resources and encourage growth and proficiency.
Furthermore, the aforementioned debates over funding and accountability do not remain siloed in the halls of public schools — USC also grapples with questions of how to spend the dollar, as the University works to strike a balance between committing to projects, research and scholarships and engaging in discussions to ensure that donors’ investments can impact every student. With a growing endowment of $4.6 billion, which ranks the University 24th nationally, USC continues to face concerns regarding how to allocate new funds responsibly, including whether that means divestment and or expanding further into the local community. And since no government doles out this endowment, the burden lies on donors to hold USC accountable to its promises and goals.
In the sixth largest economy in the world, where poverty and disparity in opportunities perpetuate inequalities, and in a society where education represents not only a foundational building block, but also a right, the Golden State must set the gold standard for teaching our youth. The fate of USC and our economy might just depend on it.
