The childhood horseplay of tickling takes on a new whole face in Tickled, an investigative documentary into the bizarre subculture of underground tickling. Yes, you read that correctly.
The film’s director and lead, David Farrier, is a New Zealand pop culture reporter familiar with the bizarre side of life. He has seen and interviewed everything from a prepubescent Justin Bieber to donkey trainers and a frog-eating survivalist. However, this 92-minute film, while certainly humorous and bizarre, documents the corrupt system of an underground tickling subculture that exploits its participants. It leaves the audience with as many questions as answers about cyberbullying and the American justice system. Tickled’s comprehensive material and risky production process, which incurred several legal threats, has made it a noteworthy film at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.
The film’s seemingly benign story begins with Farrier coming across a strange video from Jane O’Brien Media showcasing a new sport called “competitive endurance tickling” where one man is tied down and tickled by one or several other men, all of whom are youthful, attractive male athletes. The video is only the first of many and certainly makes audience members squirm in their seats when forced to become a voyeur of such an odd practice. It ultimately prompts Farrier to post on the company’s public Facebook page asking for an interview. However he is shockingly met with vulgarity and undisguised homophobia.
“To be brutally frank,” a Jane O’Brien staff member writes, “association with a homosexual journalist is not something we will embrace,” along with multiple, less formal epithets. The insults are hard to take seriously and only piques Farrier’s, and later, cameraman Dylan Reeve’s, interests.
The tone shifts dramatically when Jane O’Brien Media gets wind of Farrier and Reeve’s investigative documentary and sends three representatives to New Zealand to discuss legal issues. The meeting between Farrier and the Jane O’Brien representatives begin congenially until a member notices the presence of Farrier’s camera.
“We’re not going to get along,” says the representative. “You attacked us in an airport.” The uneasy exchange indicates something more insidious than anticipated about the company. It soon becomes apparent that anyone related to the elusive Jane O’Brien remain aloof, not out of spite, but seemingly for their own sake, which is eerie and intriguing at the same time. The documentary seems to shift between these bouts of drama and an awkward, voyeuristic humor, creating a rather choppy tone as Farrier and Reeve dig deeper into the world of tickling fetishes.
However, the duo’s determination in finding the source of this tickling empire must be commended in the film. They travel to America and out of a hundred of Jane O’Brien Media participants, they manage to contact one, who details the onslaught of threatening emails and online harassment he received following his break from the company. The information is shocking and seemingly disproportionate to what is only some tickling.
Their investigation also extends into the more benign side of online tickling fetishes, which may make audience members think maybe this isn’t such a bad thing after all. Richard Ivey, who runs a similar tickling empire with a cross into foot fetish territory, is completely open and frank about his business. Ivey serves as a complete foil to Jane O’Brien, clearly embracing this fetish without the exploitation and covert brutality Jane O’Brien exercises. It isn’t the tickling fetish itself that totally unnerves, but the way it is being used. Thus the real question for Farrier and Reeves becomes one about the motives and elusive identity of Jane O’Brien, who begins to bear a striking similarity to a past tickling enthusiast called “Terri Tickle.”
The film contains elements from both mystery-thriller and comedy, packaged into a cinematically elegant documentary, in which still photographer, Dominic Fryer, has a hand. However, what makes Tickled an engaging film is its firsthand account of a corrupt system that exists right under audience’s noses. Though Tickled ultimately exposes the culprit, the audience is still left wondering if justice has really been served. There really is no true ending to the story. What is most disturbing, however, is how quickly the tickling becomes a metaphor for power and control exerted by the anonymous figure, Jane O’Brien. The gleeful laughter permeating the film soon turns hysterical and eerie, haunting viewers at the end and forcing them to realize that this obscure and fascinating phenomenon has been a growing trend.

Long Island native Jon Bellion released his debut album The Human Condition on Friday, a pop album featuring 14 songs that tell stories of life, love and everything in between. He is best known for writing the song “The Monster,” which was featured on Eminem’s Marshall Mathers LP 2 in 2013 and won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2015. His career quickly launched from there, co-writing the hit song “Trumpets” with Jason Derulo, collaborating with Zedd and starting his solo career with The Human Condition.
The album is a compilation of tracks that comment on the modern human story, ranging from adolescent romance to newfound fame. Love songs like “Overwhelming” and “Guillotine” feature memorable choruses that listeners will be able to sing along to. Bellion presents deeper messages in tracks such as “Weight of the World” and “New York Soul Pt ii.” Both contain powerful and thought-provoking lyrics that address personal issues from family struggle to career aspirations.
Although Bellion produces multiple hits with interesting narratives like “80’s Films,” The Human Condition struggles with the problem of over-production. Many tracks were edited with vocal compression and Auto-Tune.
Throughout the album, Bellion’s voice is overwhelmed by a plethora of sounds and beats that attempt to replicate sonic elements in current pop music. The album is anything but sincere, instead relying heavily on digital elements when it shouldn’t, as Bellion already has a good voice. The Human Condition is riddled with Auto-Tune and doesn’t allow Bellion’s artistic talent to properly shine.
Yet while the production may be over the top, tracks like “New York Soul Pt ii,” and “Maybe IDK,” redeem the album. “New York Soul” features raw verses of Bellion rapping and about on living life in the Big Apple. When the chorus comes back in after the rap verses, it’s a soft contrasting melody that creates a somber, pensive tone. The track is one of the best on the album, revealing Bellion’s vulnerability and allowing listeners to create a connection with the artist.
Bellion reaches out to listeners in his modern anthem and fourth single “Maybe IDK.” While the title of the song feels slightly immature, the song quickly redeems itself and is a standout on the album. The track features acoustic guitar and vocals, and doesn’t feel as overproduced as many of the others, but instead feels honest and anthemic. The lyrics, “Maybe I don’t know, but maybe that’s okay,” resonate deeply and the melody underneath them make this song soar as everyone lives in a world filled with questions and the unknown.
Overall, the album features many well-composed songs masked behind heavy electronic production, which is a shame because Bellion has a remarkable voice. Bellion is currently on a national tour and will be playing a sold-out show at L.A.’s Fonda Theater in July.
I didn’t hear anything amounting to Autp Tune on the whole record…

Last week, a new California smoking law went into effect, raising the legal smoking age to 21. With this law, California became the second state to set an age limit of 21 to purchase tobacco, joining Hawaii and more than 100 cities.
Although some dispute the effectiveness of the new law, with one Los Angeles Times op-ed saying it won’t help teens, and the Daily Bruin deeming it ineffective, multiple studies have indicated that raising the age requirement could drastically reduce the percentage of smokers.
21 is a key age — more than just curbing smoking for 18- to 21-year-olds, it could also limit underage smoking, since a 2001 study found that friends are the leading source of cigarettes for teen smokers across all grades. While it’s common for 18-year-olds — high school seniors — to be in the same social circles as adolescents, making it easy for children to obtain legally-bought cigarettes, 21-year-olds are typically either in college or working. Cutting off underage smoking is especially important because almost 90 percent of cigarette smokers first try smoking by age 18, according to the Center for Disease Control, and that addiction can follow them for the rest of their lives.
Based on the impact of delaying smoking initiation, the Institute of Medicine released a report last year predicting that raising the age limit to 21 would prevent approximately 223,000 premature deaths for people born between 2000 and 2019. The study found that it would also decrease adult smoking prevalence by 12 percent.
However, the promise of health benefits doesn’t justify raising the minimum smoking age past 18. Although the plea to “think of the children” is powerful, that’s not enough of a reason to interfere with the autonomy of adults. In the United States, 18 is the age when children enter adulthood, with all the rights and responsibilities that confers.
Though proponents of the age limit point to recent research showing that the brain doesn’t reach full maturity until 25, the law clearly considers them ready to take care of themselves much earlier.
At 18, people are entrusted with all kinds of serious, life-changing decisions. They can choose their career path, choose who to vote for and even choose to lay down their lives for their country. That’s just how our society’s set up, which makes sense — once high school ends, most people will be living on their own, paying taxes and either going to college or holding down full-time jobs. In short, they’re expected to be fully independent adults capable of making their own way in the world, for better or worse.
The law’s exemption for active military personnel misses the point. It was added after other legislators criticized the bill for deeming 18-year-olds old enough to join the army but not to smoke. However, it’s nonsensical to think that 18-year-olds in military service are more ready to smoke than other 18-year-olds. The importance of adulthood isn’t to join the military — it’s the choice of whether to join the military. It’s clear that this exemption was aimed more at pandering for votes than at seriously considering the capabilities of young adults.
The new smoking age limit is one of the only age requirements that restricts people over 18. Others, like the age requirements for drinking or buying a gun, are intended to protect the community from drunk drivers and the effects of gun violence — not the users themselves. But there are already many laws in place to protect people from secondhand smoke. Raising the age limit to 21 isn’t intended to help nonsmokers — it’s meant to shield potential smokers from themselves, something with little to no precedent.
This law also separates itself from previous anti-smoking legislation aimed at lowering smoking rates. In the ‘50s and ‘60s, Congress passed several laws to regulate cigarette advertising, especially to young adults, and added Surgeon General warnings to all packaging and advertisements. Now, the dangers of smoking are widely known.
Unlike that era, when the health effects of smoking were still controversial, and tobacco companies could appeal to kids with cartoons and celebrity endorsements, everyone who picks up a pack of cigarettes today can see the consequences of smoking emblazoned on the side of the box. These laws have made it possible for people to make informed choices about smoking — now it’s time for the government to step back and let them make that choice.
Reject antismoker measures. See the latest study disputing the risks of second hand smoke: Peter N Lee, John S Fry, Barbara A Forey, Jan S Hamling, Alison J Thornton, Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and lung cancer: A systematic review. World J Meta-Anal. Apr 26, 2016; 4(2): 10-43, doi: 10.13105/wjma.v4.i2.10
CONCLUSION: Most, if not all, of the ETS/lung cancer association can be explained by confounding adjustment and misclassification correction. Any causal relationship is not convincingly demonstrated.

On Saturday night, a celebration of LGBT pride at a Pulse Florida Nightclub in Orlando was brutally upended by a deadly massacre — the worst mass shooting in the history of America, leaving 49 people killed, 53 injured and an entire nation mourning.
While Orlando has been the most extreme case, the shooting is one of the many tragedies that have occurred in the past few weeks. The gunman pledged allegiance to ISIS and the organization recently claimed responsibility for the attack.
In light of the recent UCLA murder-suicide and the assassination of singer Christina Grimmie, it is events like these that divide our country and raise heated debates involving grave issues such as gun control, mental health, terrorism and LGBT rights.
Many against gun control raise the argument that this is not a gun control issue — that this was an act of terrorism by a homophobic Muslim and that mass shootings have occurred even in countries with strict gun control laws, such as the Paris attacks in France. While it is true that the war on terror is extremely significant, it does not discount the fact that the problem is not religion or sexuality, but the mindsets  — perpetuated by American gun culture — and weapons that foster and enable these atrocities to happen.
According to The Washington Post, roughly 30,000 people die in gun-violence-related crimes annually. Americans are 10 times more likely to be killed by guns than people in other developed countries, a study by Health Day found. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the United States’ gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. Even though the United States’ suicide rate is similar to other countries, the nation’s gun-related suicide rate is eight times higher than other high-income countries.
Not only that, a review of 2010 World Health Organization data shows that despite having a similar rate of crimes as other countries, the United States has a much higher rate of deadly violence, mostly due to the higher rate of gun-related murders. In fact, even though the United States has half the population of the other 22 nations combined, it accounted for 82 percent of the world’s gun deaths.
American gun culture has become so ridiculous that gun rights have become more important than human lives. We live in a country where people protect a document, written centuries ago, that could not have possibly anticipated the events that could unfold in our time. It is true that our country was founded under the Constitution, but the American public is now so desensitized to the issue of gun access that, even after tragedies like the Sandy Hook shooting, right-wingers are quick to point fingers at every race and religion imaginable without ever questioning the Second Amendment.
Muslims and members of the LGBT community live in fear and are targeted with hatred on a daily basis while there are “All-American” shooters who slip through the cracks without much public attention.
The GOP’s legislation that is often contrary to LGBT interests, coupled with its stubborn defense of the Second Amendment is not only causing division within their own political party, but also within America. Their continuous support for gun rights in the face of injustice and perpetuation of Islamophobia has indirectly led to these killings by distracting from the issue of gun control.
It should not take horror after horror and a large number of deaths to wake up the American public. With the number of gun-related incidents increasing, our nation has become complicit and numb to these tragedies. These casualties should not be just statistics we glance at. Our country is strong and resilient — in addition to prayer and thoughts, we must continue to fight for policy changes to stop gun violence. While it may be insensitive that many of the presidential candidates are using this national catastrophe for political promotion, it is essential that we exercise our civic duty by participating in the upcoming election and voting for a leader who will actively work toward implementing real change in gun control laws.
Do you honestly believe that murder in the US would disappear if every single gun disappeared?  Please do some research.  States that allow concealed carry of handguns have LOWER crimes rates, including murder, than those that have the strictest gun laws on the books.  It’s a fact.  I also know you aren’t being taught the meaning behind the second amendment to the US Constitution.  Ask yourself why is that after you do your own research.  Facts often get glossed over by those on the left, so if you want to be an educated person in America, you need to do your own research.  Do not rely on liberal profs to get to the truth for they too have an agenda, believe it or not.

Family and friends gathered in Bovard Auditorium Saturday to honor the inaugural graduating class of USC Hybrid High School.
The commencement ceremony began with an introduction by Hybrid High Principal Mide Macaulay. Vanessa Ruiz, the class president, then repeated the introduction in Spanish, demonstrating the diversity of the school, which is 59 percent Hispanic.
Hybrid High School, which is operated by the Rossier School of Education’s charter management organization Ednovate, was founded with the goal of providing individual attention to students and lowering drop-out rates. This year, the school achieved a 100 percent graduation rate.
Karen Gallagher, dean of Rossier School of Education, praised the graduating class for collectively earning over 400 college acceptances to 98 different schools. Each of the 85 graduates has been admitted to at least one four-year college, and six have been admitted to USC.
“I want to welcome all the Hybrid High graduates — the college-goers and agents of positive multi-generational change,” Gallagher said. “You are fully committed to being change agents, who strive to improve your own lives, as well as the lives of your families and communities, now and in the future. Your success is a tribute to your hard work and dedication.”
The ceremony’s keynote address was delivered by USC President C.L. Max Nikias, who shared with students what he termed the “three keys of success”: knowledge, character and good judgment.
Nikias stressed that students must constantly listen and read to keep up with the rapid growth of knowledge in the information age.
“Your learning experience does not end the moment you receive your diploma. For all of us, learning is a lifelong journey,” Nikias said. “You should find ways to keep yourself informed, and allow others to inform you with new points of view. You should challenge the ideas of others and encourage them to challenge you.”
Nikias went on to highlight the importance of good character in guiding the students through life.
“Your character is going to be your destiny, and the quality of your character inevitably shapes the course of your life. Character is not about being nice — it’s about earning the trust and respect of your family and friends, and, more importantly, earning the respect of your community,” Nikias said. “You build your character with small acts of honesty, humility, integrity and generosity. The road to true character is a path you must travel alone.”
Nikias closed his speech by advising students to exercise good judgment and to commit to their decisions.
“Every day, all of us are faced with hundreds of decisions. The difference between success and failure is the ability to consistently make good choices,” Nikias said. “Fortune favors the bold. If you have good judgment, you will make bold decisions that will lead you down an exciting path of adventure, discovery and success.”
The valedictorian of the class of 2016, Juan Castro, reflected on the struggles and triumphs that had brought the graduates to this point. He emphasized that, no matter where they would go in the future, they would always be linked by their place in the Trojan Family.
“Soon, we will be constellations — stars connected through space. We will be distant stars, illuminating the name of our Trojan Family, but this is the end and a new start. We will be apart, but together,” Castro said. “Our Trojan Family fire is all we need, and everything we have.”

Several South Central neighborhoods surrounding the University Park campus have been designated as Promise Zones as part of the Obama administration initiative to improve quality of life and expand opportunities in under-developed areas.
The South Los Angeles Transit Empowerment Zone, also known as SLATE-Z, is home to almost 200,000 residents and encompasses the neighborhoods of Exposition Park, Central Vernon, South Park, Leimert Park, Florence, Vermont Square and parts of the Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills area. These areas have been identified by the federal government as in desperate need of fiscal and community-wide assistance due to poor economic growth in recent decades. In 2014, President Obama created Promise Zones to prioritize certain disadvantaged areas for support after the 2008 recession.
According to a White House press release, workforce participation in SLATE-Z is low among residents; the unemployment rate is 11.8 percent in contrast to the 5.3 percent average across California. The education of locals is also suffering, with almost half of all residents dropping out of high school, and around 45 percent of SLATE-Z residents are living at or below the poverty line, three times the national average. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti came out in support of the federal program, and described SLATE-Z as necessary for the wellbeing of South Los Angeles.
“The SLATE-Z plan is rooted in strategies for ensuring physical and economic mobility for geographically and economically isolated communities,” Garcetti said in a statement. “It will succeed by building strong public and private pathways between educational and job training agencies so more students receive a high-quality education that leads to long-term educational and career success.”
Yet, the Promise Zone designation was not without its controversies. In 2014, other districts of metro Los Angeles were selected to receive federal assistance during the program’s first round of designations. The neighborhoods of Pico Union, Westlake, Koreatown, Hollywood and East Hollywood saw federal grants and support directed to their community, much to the chagrin of citizens and politicians in other impoverished districts. Developments in the initial Los Angeles Promise Zone included a local STEM high school increasing its students’ college acceptance rate to UCLA and the growth of the area’s scientific and technical industries to attract high-wage job opportunities.
The South Central community only won Promise Zone status after years of unsuccessful attempts, and on June 6 it was selected as one of the final nine Promise Zones, alongside cities such as Atlanta, San Diego and Nashville. Los Angeles is the only area in the program to have two zones within its city limits. Two Native-American territories were also selected for the program: the Spokane Tribe of Indians and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. Councilman Curren D. Price Jr., representative of the Ninth Council District where SLATE-Z’s is primarily located, spoke on the struggle to gain eligibility for the program and to direct national attention to the impoverished neighborhoods of South Central.
“This is a defining moment for South Los Angeles,” Price said. “Now, we have another tool to rewrite the South L.A. story and create the future we want for our children. The kind where one’s ZIP code or skin color does not determine the benefits or burden we bear.”
Key support for the measure came from L.A. Trade Technical College President Larry Frank, who pioneered the SLATE-Z coalition to fight poverty in the area and organized multiple reapplications for Promise Zone recognition for the area. USC was also a key partner in pushing for the designation. Associate Senior Vice President of Civic Engagement and Economic Development Craig Keys spoke on the improvements to SLATE-Z neighborhoods and how they may promote change to the USC ecosystem.
“The Promise Zone designation is important because it positions us to leverage new development in the area to foster local job creation and business expansion,” Keys said in a statement. “We hope the designation will help secure new and additional funding for job training, job placement and small business expansion services.  For example, our MBDA business assistance program is now better situated to extend its services through additional federal funding sources.”

Behrokh Khoshnevis, a professor in industrial and systems engineering at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, is changing the way that scientists look at building on the moon and beyond.
Khoshnevis is the developer of a process called Selective Separation Sintering, which enables the construction of structures in space from the materials available in space. The invention recently won first place in the NASA In-Situ Materials Challenge for creating structures in space from lunar and Martian materials.
The invention will benefit space agencies by saving the time and cost involved with sending the materials to space.
SSS, which took Khoshnevis seven years to develop, follows Khoshnevis’ previous invention, Contour Crafting, which is a 3-D printing process that also won the NASA Prize in 2014. Contour Crafting is an extrusion-based process more suitable for building large structures while SSS is a powder-based method suitable for building small-scale objects such as metallic parts, tiles and bricks.
SSS is the first process which will be able to work in zero gravity. Khoshnevis said it provides more speed, accuracy and independence from expensive technologies like lasers, is less complex and has high potential for space and planetary use.
Graduate students Jing Zhang, Behnam Zahiri and Xiao Yuan worked under Khoshnevis for his research. Along with his team, Khoshnevis has used this process to successfully develop tiles that can withstand the high pressure and temperature of landing spacecrafts.
“Every idea takes a lot of things and many manufacturing processes to form,” Khoshnevis said.
The NASA competition involved inventing ways to utilize the materials found on the moon and Mars to construct objects needed for future space missions. Khoshnevis and his team used SSS to construct objects using synthetic materials developed by the Johnson Space Center, which are the same as the materials found on Mars and the moon.
Khoshnevis received his B.S. in industrial engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran and received his M.S. and Ph.D. in industrial engineering and management from Oklahoma State University. He is a Dean’s Professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering, Astronautics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering and is the director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies (CRAFT) at USC.
Khoshnevis believes that this technique will make future space endeavors more cost-effective and efficient. Khoshnevis said that the space industry is rapidly evolving and that he’s excited to be a part of it.
“People think that these ideas are far-off and kind of fanciful and are not going to happen soon, but the reality is different,” Khoshnevis said. “Space industry is moving very fast and the future is going to be even more exciting.”
Khoshnevis and his team plan to further test the technique in vacuum conditions using the facilities at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and USC’s Astronautics Rocket Lab.

Fourteen track and field athletes competed at the NCAA Track and Field Championships at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, last week. There were 10 women and four men who qualified following their performance in the West Preliminary qualifying rounds.
The highlight of the event was sophomore Randall Cunningham winning the men’s high jump on Friday.
“It is great to be a champion,” said Cunningham in a press release. “This is what everyone trains for to come out here and be No. 1 and be a champion, so for it to actually happen for me means the world to me.”
Cunningham was able to finish strong in a season slowed down by injuries and problems.
“It was exciting to watch Randall come into his own today and jump flawlessly and PR with no misses and so much emotion,” said Director of Track & Field Caryl Smith Gilbert. “He is proud to be Trojan and we are honored that he represented us with so much charisma, class and tenacity today. He had has a tough year but he never gave up and that is a true sign of a warrior and champion.”
On Friday Cunningham started off at 2.09 m in the high jump final and did not miss a jump in the next four measures (2.14, 2.19, 2.22, 2.25). 2.25 also marks Cunningham’s outdoor PR. No one else was able to clear 2.25 m. Cunningham had his first miss at 2.28 m. When he was sure of the title, he raised the bar at 2.29 m, the Olympic “A” Standard, but fouled his last two attempts.
The men’s competition started on Wednesday with sophomore Adoree’ Jackson placing fifth in the men’s long jump. Jackson was in third place after the first three jumps with a mark of 7.65 m entering the finals but dropped off the podium before his fourth leap. His final mark of 7.66 m came in the fifth round. Jackson gave USC four points in the team competition and earned All-American status for the second year in a row. Jackson will be back in the same field battling for a spot in the Olympic team.
On the women’s side of the competition, USC was able to advance to seven final rounds. Junior Destinee Brown, sophomore Deanna Hill, senior Alexis Faulknor and senior Tynia Gaither set a new school record of 42.90 as they finished second in the 4×100 m relay.
In the women’s long jump freshman Margaux Jones and Faulknor weren’t able to finish in scoring positions, ending the event in ninth and 10th place, respectively. Jones earned second-team All-America honor.
Senior Tera Novy finished seventh in the women’s discus throw, becoming a two-time All-American. She marked 57.70 m in her third attempt and wasn’t able to improve in the final throws.
Stepter finished sixth in the 400 m hurdles final with a time of 55.30, earning her second All-American honor in the event.
Sophomore Nick Ponzio competed in the men’s shot put. He placed twelfth overall with a mark of 18.80 m, earning second-team All-America honors.
On Friday, junior Ricky Morgan Jr. ran in the 400 m final after earning a spot on Wednesday. He finished seventh in 46.63, earning first-team All-America honors.
“Track and field is full of ups and downs, but it is our responsibility is to capitalize and come through in championship situations,” said Smith-Gilbert.
GOOD JOB RANDALL :-)

The baseball team had 12 players selected in the 2016 MLB First Year Player Draft, a new program record. Three Trojans were selected on the second day of the draft and nine more were drafted on the third day. Of the athletes taken, there were eight pitchers, three outfielders and one catcher.
The first Trojan to go was junior catcher Jeremy Martinez who was chosen in the fourth round by the St. Louis Cardinals. Martinez hit .376 on the season, the second-highest on the team, with 42 RBIs, six home runs and a team-high 18 doubles. The Fountain Valley native struck out only 12 times in 213 at-bats, a number that was eighth-best in the country and Martinez earned first team All-Pac-12 honors for the past season.
Senior right-handed pitcher Brooks Kriske was selected by the New York Yankees in the sixth round of the draft. Kriske posted a 2.55 ERA over 35.1 innings and earned 42 strikeouts. The six saves Kriske accumulated over the season was good enough for a top-10 finish in the Pac-12 and the highest number on the team.
Following close behind was junior left-handed pitcher Bernardo Flores who was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the seventh round. The reliever struck out 36 over 41.2 innings of work in 2016.
On the third day of the draft, USC continued to have great success.
Senior right-handed pitchers Kyle Davis and Brent Wheatley were selected in the 14th and 17th rounds by the Seattle Mariners and the Miami Marlins respectively. Davis posted a 4.70 ERA with 62 strikeouts over 82.1 innings of work. Wheatley threw 34.1 innings and earned a 6.03 ERA while collecting 37 strikeouts.
Senior outfielder and Pac-12 batting champion David Oppenheim was chosen next by the Anaheim Angels in the 18th round. Oppenheim earned first team All-Pac-12 honors while hitting .387 to lead both the team and the conference. He knocked in 25 runs to go along with four home runs. The Washington native also had a team-high .500 on-base percentage.
Two lefty pitchers were next for the Men of Troy, in senior Marc Huberman and junior Andrew Wright. The reliever Huberman had a 1.94 ERA with 45 strikeouts through 41.2 innings. He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 18th round. Wright was drafted in the 21st round by the Cincinnati Reds despite pitching just 14.1 innings.
Joining Wright in the 21st round was pitcher Joe Navilhon. The right-hander led USC in innings pitched at 82.2 and had the lowest ERA of any starter at 3.38 while striking out 71 batters. He was taken by the Detroit Tigers.
The third and final Trojan taken in the 21st round was senior outfielder Timmy Robinson, who will be heading to the Bronx after being selected by the New York Yankees. Robinson led the team in RBIs with 46 in addition to eight home runs and 18 doubles while hitting .282.
Junior right-handed pitcher Jeff Paschke was selected in the 22nd round by the Los Angeles Dodgers. As a reliever, Paschke gathered four saves and 28 strikeouts with a 4.25 ERA through 29.2 innings pitched.
Joining Kriske and Robinson in pinstripes is junior outfielder Corey Dempster, who was taken in the 37th round. Dempster batted .290 and hit six home runs with 24 RBIs as the primary leadoff man for the Trojans.
With the 12 selections in the 2016 draft, USC now has 328 former players who have been drafted.
What does that say about the Coach, Dan Hubbs? Finished at .500 in the conference and overall. This should have been an easy qualifier team for the tournament with all those upper class-men. The draft didn’t include A.J. Ramirez who had a good season which is strange. Pitching was very suspect with Flores and Wright having bad years, yet still drafted. Hubbs supposed
strength is pitching. Time for a change in leadership with a person like the coach at Coastal Carolina who made the CWS.

It’s been 22 years since O.J. Simpson took off with Al Cowlings in his white Ford Bronco and led officers on a wild slow-speed pursuit around Los Angeles that unfolded on national television like a scene from a movie.
Most stories die down and slip away from public memory after a decade or two. This one hasn’t.
This year alone, two separate television series — “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” on FX and “O.J.: Made in America,” a five-part documentary on ESPN — have retold the drama surrounding Simpson’s alleged murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in 1994.
After Mike Breen, on the broadcast for ABC, read a promo for the latter during the NBA Finals last week, his partner Jeff Van Gundy let the viewers in on a hard-to-believe story: the Bronco was going so slow because Simpson wanted to listen to the end of Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Knicks and Rockets on the radio. The digression took on a story of its own and whipped social media into a frenzy.
There’s obviously something about the O.J. case that still intrigues us today, enough for a 10-episode series and a nearly eight-hour-long documentary to be produced about it in 2016. It was a scandal that involved close to everything — murder, domestic violence, race, police corruption and celebrity — all unfolding in the shadows of Hollywood. The books and scripts practically wrote themselves for authors and filmmakers.
The newfound attention cast upon the case has also allowed millennials to learn about and grasp the craziness of the saga. The FX series, while over-dramatized at times, was gripping, binge-worthy and balanced in its portrayal of both the prosecution and the defense. There were moments when I had to look up whether certain scenes were actually true because they were so hard to believe. Did Simpson, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., actually stand up in front of the jury and try on the pair of gloves he allegedly used while committing the murders? Was the prosecution’s star witness — a detective who collected evidence at the crime scene — actually a racist who had been caught on tape using the “n-word” and pled the fifth when asked on the stand if he planted evidence? Did one of the jurors have the audacity to raise a “black power” salute at Simpson after the not guilty verdict was read? And … Robert Kardashian? Really?
Yes, yes, yes and yes — though, as an aside, I can’t believe that man fathered everything that is wrong with America today. And as new episodes of the documentary air — all episodes are available on WatchESPN as of Tuesday — you bet there will be the same amount of intrigue in the public.
Simpson may currently be serving a lengthy prison sentence for an unrelated crime, but he will forever remain in the public eye for reasons that go far beyond his football accomplishments. When I took my parents to visit Heritage Hall a few months ago and showed them the various Heisman Trophy winners from USC, they could not have been less interested in learning about Reggie Bush, Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart, Charles White, Mike Garrett or Marcus Allen. But they were more than aware of who O.J. Simpson was and surprised he was once lighting it up for the Trojans, way back when. And while I rarely see people stop by the USC Athletic Hall of Fame plaques that face the track, when they do, they’re almost always looking at Simpson’s.
This is a case that still reverberates both nationally and locally. A column written in February by former Daily Trojan sports editor Darian Nourian arguing that USC should remove the replica display of Simpson’s Heisman trophy at Heritage Hall brought a barrage of comments and social media responses. And even more broadly, the question of whether or not O.J. “did it” can still warrant a discussion.
Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that Simpson had a history of domestic violence and that he more than likely committed the murders. And yet, in the year 2016, we are far from done with talking about the case because all of the issues that it brought forth, from race to police corruption, still very much apply today. The possibility of a superstar black athlete being set up for a crime he didn’t commit by a troubled police department would incite the same amount of protests, controversy and media attention today as it did in 1994.
That’s why this case remains relevant and why a miniseries and documentary released 22 years later can garner so much acclaim and attention. For better or for worse, we remain captivated by O.J. Simpson, and, at this rate, our children will be too.
