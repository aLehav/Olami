You can see it in the increased frequency of angst-ridden Facebook statuses, prominence of 5-Hour Energy Shots littering on-campus trash cans and the ghastly expressions of the collective student body.
The midterm season has arrived, rearing its ugly head for the first time this semester.
Coinciding with this first round of midterm exams is the all-too-familiar pastime of seeking out a suitable on-campus location to study for the night.
In the past, many have complained about the densely packed study floors of Leavey Library, with those fortunate enough to secure a study cubicle forgoing any thoughts of satisfying basic needs for fear of losing their coveted real estate.  Others have lamented the inconvenient hours and availability of other buildings on campus, including Doheny Library and buildings used for instruction during the day.
This year, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center has helped to alleviate the congestion at pre-existing on-campus study locations, with the Trojan Family room offering a large hub for studying during the day, and the outdoor courtyard furnished with a sizable number of seats and tables available for after-hours use.
But have they made enough of a difference?
Taking these improvements into account, we want to know:
Do you feel like there are adequate study spaces around campus?

I think there are plenty of places for students to study on campus and the Ronal Tutor Campus Center is great. I hate studying in Leavey and hardly ever go there but have found myself in the student center on multiple occasions.  While it is quiet, it isn’t as busy as Leavey and has a better overall atmosphere. Lets hope that doesn’t change as more and more people find out how nice the facilities are!

As part of Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign to fight childhood obesity, the White House will award $60,000 to USC students and other contest participants who successfully created software applications that encourage physical fitness.
A $20,000 grand prize will go to a team of USC students — Erin Reynolds, Tony Tseung, John Banayan, Erik Nichols, David Villatoro, Rita Yeung, Joseph Kohn and Ross Danielson ­— who created an online application called Trainer under the guidance of three faculty advisers. Yeung is a Daily Trojan staff member.
Players of the game receive a customized creature with a fitness goal. Through the use of webcam technology and movement detection, the players and the creatures exercise together.
For instance, a player might be paired with a penguin who needs to lose weight. In order for the penguin to do so weight, the player has to exercise with it by picking from a variety of activities ­— such as running, swimming or skiing — and the player has to re-enact those movements specific to the particular sport he picked.
“Depending on how hard the player trains himself, the creature becomes more fit,” said David Villatoro, a USC alumnus of 2010 and one of the students who helped create the application.
The application also has a dietary component, allowing the player to feed his creature as he pleases — ideally by feeding him the same foods the player himself is eating.
“The best way to think about the game is as a combination of both Pokemon and Wii Fit,” said team member Erin Reynolds, a graduate student studying cinematic arts.
The initial idea for the game originated in January 2009 Experimental Game Topics (CTIN 492) class, where students must pitch ideas regarding how gaming systems can affect lives in regards to exercising and dietary needs.
Alumnus John Banayan, of the class of 2010, came up with the original concept, and worked with the rest of the team to develop the idea into what is now the Trainer application demo.
The winners divided the prize money among themselves, but also kept some of it for continuing developments. The group intends to turn the demo into a full game and hope to clinically test it to see what results Trainer will have, Reynolds said.
But the award still hasn’t sunk in for some of the contestants.
“We’re all in a little bit of shock — I know I haven’t absorbed the whole thing,” Reynolds said. “It’s very exciting that the White House is looking at video games; I think video games have a lot of potential to do good in the world.”
About 17 percent of U.S. children and adolescents ages two to 19 are obese, according to a recent National Health and Nutrition and Examination Service.
Emily Luu, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said the platform for fitness education could be useful in the future.
“Because America is one of the fattest nations in the world, and we spend a lot of time playing video games, I think this is a great application because it combines both our desires to play video games and our necessity to exercise,” Luu said.

A professor at the USC School of Architecture won an international architecture award for his innovative design of a residential house located in West Los Angeles.
Gold star · Professor Andrew Liang designed the MüSh residence, which won him the international Grand Prix du Jury award this summer. - Photo courtesy of Andrew Liang 
The Grand Prix du Jury, or Jury’s Grand Prize, was awarded to Andrew Liang during the summer and recognized MüSh Residence. The project took three years to complete, Liang said.
“The honor here is simply this: You are recognized internationally,” he said. “[It’s] the recognition, the sort of affirmation, if you will, that a piece of work that you’ve done has sort of reached … a kind of considerable status … not just as a building but also as a statement.”
The prestigious international architectural competition, ARCHIZINC Trophèe, recognizes 12 finalists for their completed projects. There are four categories for submissions, and for each category a jury of 12 architecture experts selects a winner and runner-up.
Of the 12 awards, there are four special prizes that recognize projects that are exceptional in the categories of innovation, technical performance, tradition and environment. The Grand Prix du Jury is the most significant of them all.
Liang began his teaching career at Otis College of Art and Design before coming to USC less than nine years ago. Liang said he had originally planned to follow his undergraduate major and become an electrical engineer, but after a trip to Europe, he discovered his passion for architecture.
“Always be on the lookout for your passion,” Liang said, advice he often tells his students. “You can nurture a passion or you can discover it. For me, I think I discovered it.”
In addition to teaching, Liang also serves as a principal architect for the Los Angeles-based architecture firm Studio 0.10 Architects. His winning design, the MüSh Residence, was commissioned by the firm and incorporates the artistic values of the property owners, an artist and his wife.  The two have an eye for art and own a private art collection that they wanted to display in a gallery, Liang said.
To accommodate the owners’ wishes, Liang and his crew had to redefine the traditional house and gallery.
“It’s not your typical house as you would imagine it,” he said. “We’re challenging the preconception of what a house is.”
The house consists of two separate monolithic structures divided by a courtyard. The first building houses the garage and an art studio for the husband. The second holds all the rooms of a traditional house in addition to an innovative art gallery that snakes along the walls between rooms, Liang said. Both structures showcase a cubic design with artistically protruding staircases and stylistic recessions.
The unique design appealed to both the owners and the architectural jury of the ARCHIZINC Trophèe, Liang said.
Producing exceptional pieces is the main focus of Studio 0.10 Architects, he said.
“We don’t aspire to get big. The size of our firm is not relevant to me but the quality of the work we do is absolutely relevant. I want to basically do more quality over quantity,” Liang said.
Awards such as the Grand Prix du Jury create an exchange of innovation between learning about architecture and applying knowledge to projects, said Qingyun Ma, dean of the USC School of Architecture.
“Winning this prize is really bringing a lot of values to the program,” Ma said.
One particular focus of the School of Architecture is design innovation. Awards won by faculty and students not only increase the credibility of the school but also encourage the spread of ideas, he said.
“They bring the name of USC to the outside world and … they bring in [a] new standard or new energy back to the school,” Ma said.
Creativity, shown through competitions like the ARCHIZINC Trophèe, is key in times of poor consumer confidence, he said.
“At the difficult financial time, it is particularly important to invest in innovation, both in peoples’ minds and in the social structure. [It is] only through innovation that we can step out of the difficult time,” he said. “I do believe that architecture as a discipline and [as well as the school itself] can play … leading role[s] in the effort of breaking through the hard time in the financial crisis.”

Architects, engineers, government officials, students and community members met Tuesday to discuss plans to renovate a significant portion of the Figueroa Corridor streetscape.
The Figueroa Corridor Streetscape Project will create plans to redesign curbs, pavement, buildings, lights and landscapes across Figueroa in an effort to encourage community bonds, economic development and mobility.
The workshop was held to hear feedback from the community about future plans and ideas for the $20 million Figueroa street renovation.
“I believe the best streets in the world are those where the physical nature of the street goes hand in hand with the culture of the street,” said Oliver Schulze, one of the design directors from Gehl Architects pioneering the project. “In order to design a great street we need to understand what goes on at that street.”
The Figueroa Corridor Streetscape Project covers more than three miles of Figueroa Street between 11th and 41st streets, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Figueroa Street to Vermont Avenue. The project is led by the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles.
One of the biggest objectives is to make Figueroa more conducive for walking and bicycling, Schulze said. This means creating a  “comfortable and cool” environment that is safe and accessible for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders.
Schulze also hopes to minimize the presence and impact of vehicular traffic by providing easier connectivity between housing and transit.
“Figueroa can be an iconic street that can represent something great about its host city Los Angeles,” Schulze said. “Figueroa is waiting for an improvement and it needs to become a much more active place that’s fast and safe.”
With upcoming infrastructure improvements on Figueroa, city planners said they hope to encourage more housing developments within the area.
Paul Nagakura from Selbert Perkins Designs in Los Angeles said he hopes to some day use Figueroa as a weekend destination for his wife and daughter.
“Right now Figueroa has some highlights, but as a whole it’s not well-connected,” Nagakura said. “There are some areas that are not as safe and it is difficult for people to see this as a destination.”
Schulze’s architecture firm analyzed public space in Figueroa. It worked with students from USC, UCLA and other representatives to help determine what the culture and traffic activity is like on Figueroa.
“The Figueroa Corridor does not become a dividing line between these activities, but more as a connector between these profiles,” Schulze said. “You should overlap evening activity with daytime activity in USC.“
Alex Boekelheide, director of online and print communications at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, said he bikes from Downtown Los Angeles to USC nearly every day along Figueroa.
“I’d like to see more safety for bicyclists, especially with more students living in Downtown,” Boekelheide said. “There’s a strip of fast food chains, [so] anything to add a bit of variety would help a lot.”

What if I told you the man who truly paved the way for the likes of Charles White, O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen and Reggie Bush never won a Heisman Trophy, a national championship or found himself heading up the backfield for an NFL team?
Would you believe me?
Versatile - Don Doll came to USC with the intention of playing quarterback, but ended up making waves at running back and safety.
Odds are, unless you knew the history of Trojan football like the back of your hand, the answer would be a confident “no,” accompanied by a half-hearted chuckle.
And who would blame you?
I mean, one look inside the ground floor of Heritage Hall or beneath the peristyles at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and you understand who the main players were that built up the prestigious foundation of this celebrated program.
But getting overlooked is nothing new for 5-foot-10, 180-pound Don Doll.
The legend of this Trojan trailblazer dates back about 60 years, when the Lakers were still in Minnesota, Felix the Cat was a popular comic strip rather than a dealership façade and Carl’s Jr. wasn’t a local mainstay but a national novelty.
At 17, Doll came to campus on the coattails of his high school exploits as a star quarterback from Sacramento.
But at USC, Doll would not become the big man on campus with his arm or his play-calling abilities.
No, then-USC coach Jeff Cravath saw a more useful purpose for the highly touted prospect: to start him on both sides of the football at playmaking positions.
The transformation seemed foolish — a ploy that likely would have warranted a greater amount of uproar from Trojan fans, if the majority of the nation’s time and attention had not been focused on fighting a war overseas.
Just imagine the obnoxious number of Twitter feeds and Facebook statuses that would ensue if Lane Kiffin were to move Matt Barkley to starting linebacker.
Luckily for Cravath and USC, in the opener against UCLA, Doll instantly went from the out-of-position liability to the candid figure plastered on the Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Times.
An interception of a future first-round draft pick, a 20-yard run up the middle and a touchdown to seal his two minutes of fame later, and the rest was history for Doll.
Following his heroics in the 1945 Rose Bowl, one might expect the now-budding campus icon would rest on the laurels of his spotlight-inducing season.
To really understand the legend of Doll, you first have to understand that what made him such an invaluable piece of Trojan history was more than rushing yards, interceptions, box score snippets and cases full of postseason brass.
For Doll, it was always about playing for the person next to him. Fans loved him for his agility and the effortless quality in his step, and coaches found him endearing because of his eagerness to contribute. But most importantly, his teammates relied on him because of his unrelenting desire to compete, regardless of the size of the fox hole.
“My size is no detriment in football,” he once told Los Angeles Times reporter Jeane Hoffman. “I rate as the number one asset the desire to tackle. And I’ve plenty of that desire.”
It was this quality — one that was often hidden by his reserved and understated persona — that made him an ideal candidate to make the leap from the gridiron to the South Pacific in 1945.
Though Doll rarely discussed his year away at war, one of USC’s most underappreciated history-makers laid witness to one of the more riveting moments in our country’s existence — the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945.
And you thought you lived a full life at 18 years of age?
Determined to prove his freshman feats were far from an aberration, Doll returned to USC after an honorable discharge and spent his final three years in cardinal and gold, leaving no doubt that he was more than a one-dimensional force.
For three straight seasons he would lead the team in rushing, a streak that no Trojan in the history of the program had ever achieved.
Although this mark alone deserves attention, the fact that he did so while also serving as USC’s safety, punter and punt returner should have you scrambling through the nearest copy of your 2010 USC Football Guide wondering how you ever skipped over such an acclaimed alumnus.
But this history lesson about the best known Trojan you’ve never heard of gets much better.
Doll didn’t just play his part on special teams; he excelled at it, leading the conference in punting yards and punt return average in 1947 while also being named as the West team’s punter in the 1948 East-West Shrine Game.
The in-your-face caveat to this vastly untold tale remains that during Doll’s tenure at USC there were no signing day media spectacles, scholarships weren’t given out left and right, and, frankly, it was the norm to play several positions.
Before you close the book on Doll, like every professional team did for the first 66 picks of the 1948 NFL draft, don’t neglect his ability to play on the element of surprise.
Six years is typically not a great sample to gauge the long-term impact of an NFL player, but for Doll, there was no time table when it came to rewriting the league’s history books.
As a rookie safety in 1949, he led the league with an astounding 11 interceptions (the most by any first year player), four of which came in a single game (also a record that still stands today).
After his Pro Bowl rookie campaign Doll would again lead the league with 12 intercepted passes in 1950, en route to a second-straight appearance in the NFL All-Star game. In 1952, despite a down year individually, the former-USC playmaker helped anchor a top-notch Detroit secondary to NFL supremacy, as the Lions captured the NFL championship  — an achievement they have failed to repeat since.
During his final year with the Lions in 1953 — his last of four trips to the Pro Bowl — Doll again topped the leader board in interceptions with 10.
He would become the only player ever to end three seasons with 10 or more interceptions.
Yes, before Primetime and Revis Island, Doll was the crème de la crème of defensive backs in the NFL, minus the high-stepping and contract disputes.
And although I admit it is easy to be reverential about a man whose impact can only be witnessed through press clippings, aging photos and faded film footage, the story of Doll, whose dance steps came to a final conclusion last week at the age of 84, is in many ways a university treasure.
He lacked the strength of O.J. Simpson, never had the flair of Reggie Bush or the quick step of Marcus Allen, but to those who watched Doll — running back/punter/safety extraordinaire — he was an ageless wonder.
Although your next trip to some of USC athletics’ finest landmarks and historical points likely won’t lead you to distinct recollections of his contributions to the program, just know he belongs with the greats.
For as long as you keep his legacy alive, Doll will continue to dance in the annals of Trojan lure.

Days after giving up 536 yards of total offense in a 32-31 loss to Washington, the USC defense was back on the field Tuesday trying to improve itself for the high-powered, physical Stanford offense it will face Saturday.
Filling in · Because of senior kicker Joe Houston’s inconsistent play this season, senior punter Jacob Harfman is competing for his spot. - Mannet Saini | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans face another elite quarterback in Stanford’s Andrew Luck, and USC defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin said the defense has to crack down on giving up significant yards.
“You can’t give up big plays,” he said. “You’re going to give up some yards and plays but when you get the big yardage like that it’s going to come from big plays. You don’t put up 500 yards of offense without big plays. How many times are you going to have 500 yards of offense that [are] five, six, seven, even 12 yards a clip?”
USC ranks 116th out of 120 teams in passing defense, giving up an average of 288 yards through the air each game. With Stanford ranking 29th in passing offense, averaging 255.6 yards per game led by preseason Heisman candidate Luck, the Trojans know they have to improve.
“You got to know you can’t take any plays off,” sophomore safety Jawanza Starling said. “It’s not a sense that you’re not mentally ready or prepared. It’s knowing that at anytime they can take a shot at you and go deep, not always expect the routes to go shorter or be run plays.”
The Trojans’ defense also needs to improve on missed tackles, something that doesn’t show up in the box score. USC missed several tackles when Washington running back Chris Polk ripped off a 26-yard run that put the Huskies in field-goal range late in the fourth quarter.
But the issue goes beyond that play and is something the Trojans have struggled with throughout the season.
“We’re not playing very well,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We’re really emphasizing [missed tackles] this week. I obviously was hoping we’d play a lot better. Maybe early on I didn’t account for how inexperienced they really were. You’ve got a true freshman at corner, two true sophomores at safety getting their first significant playing time, and [senior cornerback] Shareece Wright, who many think is a veteran, had only three starts coming into this year. So maybe my expectations were a little high for them. But still with that we got to play a lot better.”

Kiffin said after Saturday’s loss that he would open up the kicking competition this week and he stuck to his word. Incumbent kicker senior Joe Houston, who is 2-for-6 on field goals for the year and missed a 40-yard attempt that hit the upright late in Saturday’s game, and senior punter Jacob Harfman both took six field goals apiece at the end of practice.
Houston went 2-for-6 and Harfman went 4-for-6 on kicks that were taken from about 35, 45 and 50 yards out.
Harfman said he hadn’t kicked a field goal in three months and didn’t know he was going to be kicking in practice until Tuesday afternoon.
Kiffin said the competition will last all week and whoever does better will kick on Saturday, but based on the combined 6-for-12 on field goals Tuesday, he wasn’t very optimistic when talking about the uprights.
“Basically what we got out of that was that we’ll be going for it more in the red zone if they don’t improve,” Kiffin said.

Senior fullback Stanley Havili did not participate in practice after dislocating his shoulder early in last week’s game.
Havili has had chronic problems with his left shoulder, and even though he popped it right back in after Saturday’s injury, he didn’t get another carry and only caught two more passes during the rest of the game.
Havili, who was crucial in the attack at Washington State, said he expects to practice and play this week, and that his injury won’t limit him in any way.
—
Consistent play has been lacking from the defensive front seven this year.
Excluding the Washington State game, the Trojans haven’t regularly gotten pressure on the quarterback or had crucial sacks, fumbles or interceptions — something Kiffin hopes to improve this weekend.
“We haven’t had a lot of significant plays in tough times — the big sack, the big fumble, the big interception, the big play on the ball that’s going to be a first down that they knock out,” Kiffin said. “I would imagine we’re the worst no-huddle defense in all of football right now. We’ve given up 34-37 points in no-huddle and something like 477 yards in no-huddle situations through five games. Those are points that people are getting real fast on us, where you need those types of [defensive] plays.”
Clarification: The print version of this story states that Jacob Harfman went 3-for-6 on field goals at Tuesday’s practice. Harfman actually went 4-for-6, which would bring the total between Harfman and Joe Houston to 6-for-12. The online version has been changed to reflect this edit.

The No. 2 USC women’s golf team was looking for a solid second day at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational.
The team got one, but unfortunately for the Women of Troy, it just wasn’t good enough to put them in first.
On the cusp · Junior Lisa McCloskey sits tied for 12th place at 3-over-par 147 (72-75) after two days of competition in Tacoma, Wash. She kept par through the first round, but a double bogey on the eighth hole Tuesday ended her streak. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
A consistent second round left the team at 2-under-par 574 (285-289), seven strokes behind No. 5 California at 9-under 567 (284-283), despite all five team members placing in the top 20 through two rounds.
“We needed a couple of players to go a little bit deeper to keep up with Cal,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “Nobody did anything terrible, but we didn’t make enough birdies.”
Senior Lizette Salas was the lowest scorer for the Women of Troy, firing a second consecutive 1-under-par round to tie for third at 2-under-par 142 (71-71). Salas sits six shots behind first-place Emily Childs of Cal. After closing her front nine with two bogeys, Salas rebounded with four birdies and a lone bogey on her final nine holes.
Also tied for third is freshman Sophia Popov, who followed her first-round 68 with a 2-over-par 74 to sit at 2-under-par 142. Her front and back nines were remarkably similar, with two bogeys and one birdie on each.
“I didn’t make any putts at all,” Popov said. “I don’t want to miss any three-footers [on Wednesday], which happened quite often today.”
Junior Inah Park moved into the top 10 and is tied for seventh at 1-over-par 145 (74-71). One bogey was offset by two birdies as Park positioned herself for her first top-10 finish this season.
Junior transfer Lisa McCloskey is tied for 12th at 3-over-par 147 (72-75). She had four birdies to offset five bogeys, but couldn’t overcome a double bogey on the eighth hole.   
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez is tied for 19th at 5-over-par 149 (76-73). She was sitting at 1-under through 16 before bogeying the final two holes.
A top-20 finish would be Rodriguez’s best finish on the year.
Despite their individual successes, the Women of Troy were realistic about their chances of winning the tournament.
“A seven-shot deficit is pretty significant on a course like this,” Gaston said. “We need a few girls to go low if we’re going to have a chance.”
The Tacoma Country and Golf Club is narrow, and trees line all the fairways. Gaston said it is different for the team to play on narrow fairways, as courses in Southern California tend to be more open.
“There’s a lot of birdies out there, but you have to stay out of the trees,” Gaston said. “We definitely lost some strokes in the trees.”
The team also knows that staying out of the trees alone won’t make up for seven strokes, and that the elements aren’t an excuse for not playing their best.
“I’m looking to make a lot more birdie putts,” Popov said. “We’ve got to win the whole thing on the greens.”

With Los Angeles experiencing record-breaking high temperatures last week, the recently released Hot Summer Days, has hit the city at just the right time. Directed by Tony Chan and Wing Shya, the film includes 16 of China’s top stars, from Hong Kong to the mainland.
Hot and heavy · Hot Summer Days focuses on love stories between people of various classes, from blue collar workers dreaming of better lives to a writer (Vivian Hsu) trying to woo a sushi cook (Daniel Wu). - Photos courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures 
Unlike a lot of Chinese films, Hot Summer Days received some foreign assistance. 20th Century Fox stepped forward to start international production and Hot Summer Days has become the first Chinese language film produced by the studio.
Although Hot Summer Days will not be released in Los Angeles until Friday, USC’s Outside the Box [Office] and the East Asian Studies Center held a preview screening at the USC School of Cinematic Arts on Sunday. Audiences experienced innocent love with laughter and tears, and were inspired by the idea that even the hottest days can be spent in a romantic tryst.
The movie is set during the hottest summer on record in Hong Kong, with temperatures reaching an astonishing 113 degrees Fahrenheit. As the government warns citizens to prepare for the abnormal weather, and passions start growing with the temperature, seven unbelievable stories come true.
Chauffeur Wah (Jacky Cheung) and foot masseuse Li Yan (Rene Liu) are average working-class citizens who dream of pursuing other, more exciting careers: the chauffeur dreams of racing Ferraris and the masseuse of being a pianist. Their lives intertwine when both suffer from heatstrokes  and are sent to the hospital.  A wrong text message connects the two dreamers’ fates, and a love story begins. In the text message world, they resume their dreams. The big question is whether their love will endure when they discover each others’ true identity.
At the same time, an air conditioning repairman, Ah Wai, (Nicholas Tse) finds himself enamored with biker chick Ding Dong (Vivian Hsu).
Young boy Da Fu (Xinbo Fu) bets his boss that the most beautiful girl (Angelababy) in the factory next door, will become his girlfriend. To prove his love, the girl asks him to stand outside in the heat for 100 days. Halfway through, the young boy witnesses the girl being taken out in her boss’ car, jeopardizing his determination to withstand the heat to win the heart of the one he loves.
All of these plots intertwine with many funny and moving moments — the film could be considered a hybrid between Love Actually and the romantic storyline of Inception. The film’s directors utilize the narrative structure of the former and decorate the story with time and space-shifting elements of the latter, but this ultimately does not make any creative breakthrough.
The forced mixture of these two creative movies did not help Chan and Shya win the audience’s hearts. Instead, audiences in China, where the movie was released earlier this year, criticized the familiar story elements. Many Chinese audiences said they expected the film to have an original concept, especially because of the cooperation between Chinese and American studios.
Although the construction of the narrative did not bring audiences extra surprise, the all-star cast never let the audience down.
Tse abandons his usual heroic figure and does a fine job as a simple handyman. Liu creates a rougher portrayal of her character, while adding a working-class charm to the role.
Although it has problems because of  limitations in storytelling, the exceptional cast elevates the film beyond its weak narrative structure.
The biker chick is played by Barbie Hsu (大S), not Vivian Hsu. Vivian’s the writer, as you not in your photo caption. Of course, the photo is of Angelababy…

After serving as the epicenter of California car culture for more than half a century, it’s no wonder Los Angeles residents only take to the streets for Lakers championships and riots.
Sunday, however, will hopefully change all that as a seven-and-a-half-mile stretch of Los Angeles asphalt gets closed off to cars and opened up to the people.
Inspired by Bogotá, Colombia’s decades-old open-streets event Ciclovía, Los Angeles’ version — dubbed CicLAvia — will turn a zigzagged route from Boyle Heights to East Hollywood into a public park where Angelenos can, as CicLAvia’s most recent advertising campaign says, “Come out and play.”
The event has become an institution in Bogotá, where every Sunday 2 million residents take over 70 miles of normally congested streets with bikes, skateboards, frisbees, exercise gear, picnic baskets and music. The temporary open space is designated for recreational activities, and residents of all ages, races, shapes and sizes come out to utilize it. It is a welcomed relief from Bogotá’s weekday streets,  which are usually overrun with cars and trucks, and from the smog-clogged skies that loom above the dense urban center.
Sound familiar?
As a response to our own overcrowded streets and smog-filled skyline, a hodgepodge group of community activists came together last year to determine if a similar street-takeover would be possible in Los Angeles. To their surprise, the city wanted in.
Earlier this year, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pledged to cover all city-related expenses (law enforcement, traffic control, etc.), and the team created a public funding website, receiving all the necessary money through citizen pledges over the summer.
Originally planned for Sept. 12, CicLAvia’s inaugural test run was pushed back to Oct. 10 to allow for more thorough promotion and alliterated-date addition (10-10-10). By starting the route in Boyle Heights and running it through the heart of Downtown, Westlake and Koreatown, CicLAvia is catering specifically to Los Angeles’ underserved citizens. And with bilingual advertising permeating its recent marketing strategies, the extra month has proven invaluable in getting word of the free event out to Los Angeles’ ethnic communities.
Instead of plotting its haphazard course around recognizable city landmarks, much like the Los Angeles Marathon does each year, the CicLAvia route is scheduled to go through neighborhoods many Angelenos have never seen outside of a car, if even at all. This will allow participants to not only explore these parts of the city from a street-level perspective, but to also experience the diverse neighborhoods that are often hidden from mainstream Los Angeles.
In addition to its ability to foster physical and social networks between Los Angeles’ multicultural populations, CicLAvia is also about public space.
The city has been making strides to improve its public spaces in recent years, but an open-streets event does more than just convert a shopping mall into an outdoor plaza. It redefines the space in people’s minds so that what has always been thought of as a street suddenly becomes a field to play soccer. A store that was once a blur on someone’s morning commute can turn into a favorite sidewalk cafe.
But CicLAvia is also a way to introduce alternative modes of transportation to hard-headed Angelenos. Similar open-streets events have been formed in Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. where their popularity is aided by functional cycling infastructures and copious public transit.
In Los Angeles, unfortunately, the situation is more dire. Public transportation, cycling and even walking are foreign concepts to many locals. By removing cars as an option, however, residents will be free to try alternate modes of transporation in a safe, secure environment, the result hopefully spurring positive transportation habits when the streets reopen to cars.
This first CicLAvia is an experiment on all fronts. If it is successful in fulfilling its multi-faceted uses — and all the buzz indicates that it will — the goal is  for CicLavia to become a weekly event. And with year-round outdoor weather, there is no reason CicLAvia cannot become a new Sunday tradition.
With an act as simple as removing cars from the streets, Los Angeles will create options for healthier lifestyles, bridge disparate communities, generate social change and laugh in the face of the city’s longtime car culture.

For those who crave sushi, but don’t want to pay $8 for a small hand roll or $14 for a few pieces of sashimi over special crispy rice, Oomasa is the perfect venue.
Authentic grub · Oomasa features many classic Japanese dishes, and in large portions. Some options include bento boxes packed with terriyaki chicken alongside vegetable tempura and a bowl of miso soup. - Nicole Morrison | Daily Trojan 
Located in the heart of Little Tokyo, right beside the giant red tower marking the entrance to the Japanese Village Plaza Mall at First Street, Oomasa is a haven for Japanese tradition and cuisine.
Inside the two large wooden doors that make up the entrance is a quaint restaurant with booths lining both the sidewall and the center aisle. Off to the left is a sushi bar, where fresh fish and meats are displayed for customers. Behind the counter, a sushi chef prepares order after order.
At meal times this place is packed, with lines forming along the back wall of the restaurant as customers scan the menu for the day’s specials and new dishes to try, or wait patiently for a table and their turn for a meal.
One cannot go wrong at Oomasa, where lunch specials provide a smorgasbord of Japanese cuisine at very reasonable prices. One option is the Teriyaki chicken special, which comes with tempura vegetables, pickled cabbage, miso soup, salad and more for only $11. There are many variations of main dishes and specials, and each one comes with the same array of sides — if not more.
If sushi is the desired choice, the options available are nearly endless. Oomasa has all of the basics — California rolls, spider rolls and spicy tuna rolls — but the rainbow roll is one of Oomasa’s most memorable dishes.
A rainbow roll is a California roll and tops it with an assortment of fresh fish and seafood, including shrimp, tuna, yellowtail, halibut, eel and salmon. The fish is arranged atop the roll in a way that is both visually appealing and delicious. With this new and improved version of an undisputed classic, the customer not only gets six pieces of a large cut roll but also six pieces of thin, lean and fresh sashimi — all for only $12.
Another prime example of popular sushi at an affordable price is Oomasa’s shrimp tempura roll. A favorite among many American sushi consumers for its mixture of traditional sushi rice and seaweed casing combined with pieces of fried shrimp, the shrimp tempura roll at Oomasa is easily within most budgets at  $5.50.
If the idea of inexpensive food, a variety of specials and quality rolls and dishes to choose from is not enough to make the drive to Little Tokyo and try Oomasa firsthand, then the clientele should be able to quell any ideas that this place is just too good to be true.
Although the showy and artful dishes of Japanese fusion sweep through Downtown Los Angeles, putting popular places like Katsuya at the top of charts and polls for best sushi around, Oomasa remains a hidden oasis of true sushi the way the Japanese intended.
Only a short drive from campus, it is well worth the trip to experience this food and atmosphere. Here it is possible to have a good meal and a good time — and save some money while doing so.
Oomasa isn’t bad, but we all know Mr. Noshi is the true sushi master.

After taking some much-needed downtime between albums, KT Tunstall has made a bold re-entrance onto the music scene.
Working nonstop between her first two albums, Tunstall opted to take a break from worldwide touring and begin a period of globe-trotting self-reflection. The result is a new compilation of Tunstall’s works that blends raw acoustics with prominent electronic layers in an attempt to show that she has “the balls.”
Photo courtesy of EMI Music
Listeners will remember the Scottish singer-songwriter’s hits “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree” and “Suddenly I See” from her first album, Eye to the Telescope and Tunstall’s other bluesy tracks. Her third album, Tiger Suit, released Tuesday in the United States, ventures into new territory by mixing her original acoustic sound with rhythm-driven dance beats.
The Grammy nominee qualifies her style on Tiger Suit as “nature techno,” but in this collision of musical genres, the self-proclaimed techno sound does not do Tunstall’s talent justice. Her sometimes hoarse, sometimes soothing vocals are best served when she sticks to the more natural sounds of acoustic instrumentation, which add to the richness of her verses.
Her voice is sweet, soulful and strong, cutting through sound on even the more electronic-based tracks. It adds cohesion to her album and is the standout of her work.
The album opens with the raw tones of “Uummannaq Song,” a tribute to Tunstall’s time spent in Greenland between albums, the beginning of her global foray. Tunstall holds nothing back, belting out lines like Hold your fire, I’m coming out/ and I’ll tell you the truth, promising the world that her words will be honest.
In terms of lyrics, “Uummannaq Song” sets the tone for the rest of the album with more organic instrumentation and, what appear to be, Tunstall’s war cries set this track apart from the rest.
Though the title reflects a somber message — consider the fifth track on Tiger Suit the album’s ear candy. “Fade like a Shadow,” the first song on the album to be released for radio in the United States, pulses with energy that seems contrary to its namesake. The track explodes with an upbeat sound and frank storytelling that provides a solid example of Tunstall’s recent experimentation with electronic tools.
Tiger Suit’s sixth track, “Lost,” is a vocal gem. Tunstall effortlessly flows between breathy falsetto and raspy full voice, adding force to lyrics that grow especially strong in the chorus. Here, Tunstall makes the background synthesizer and the more prominent instrumentals work in a wistful blend. The opening bit of the track is reminiscent of The Postal Service — if The Postal Service coupled its intros with acoustic strumming and oriental chimes.
Although the multi-tracked background vocals give Tunstall’s lyrics a layered feel, her story still shines through with her precise and powerful pipes. The 4:41 track is Tunstall’s best take on nature techno,  and gives listeners the chance to get lost in the song itself. There is something haunting about Tunstall’s musings, as though listeners are tuning in to internal thoughts rather than vocalized ideas.
In “(Still a) Weirdo,” the first track chosen for U.K. airwaves, Tunstall keeps the promise she made in “Uummannaq Song” by taking a look at her identity. The self-aware lyrics Optimistic but never quite elegant / still a weirdo, still a weirdo after all these years, echo in a prominent background whistle, perhaps suggesting that Tunstall is satisfied — even proud — with these objective self-inferences.
Other highlights on Tiger Suit include the glam “Madame Trudeaux” and the aggressive “Glamour Puss,” which provide the similar explosive instrumentation and distinct vocal power present in “Fade Like A Shadow.” These contrast with more intimate tracks, such as “Difficulty” and “Golden Frames,” which in some aspects echo Tunstall’s earlier work and give listeners a variety of sound textures to sift through.
Will fans of Eye to the Telescope and Drastic Fantastic find Tunstall’s new syncopated dance beats contrary to the artist they knew? Maybe. Nonetheless, Tiger Suit might prove to be Tunstall’s chance bear her newfound synth-inspired fangs.

The Department of Public Safety and the Los Angeles City Fire Department responded to a car fire in Parking Structure X Tuesday afternoon, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
The fire was reported at about 12:49 p.m., he said, but DPS officers were able to contain the blaze with fire extinguishers before LAFD arrived.
The fire started under the hood of the car and was extinguished in 10 minutes, Carlisle said, adding that it did not appear to be arson.

One of the more interesting developments in California’s gubernatorial race: allegations that Meg Whitman hired an illegal immigrant to clean her house despite her policy stance that employers must be held accountable for hiring illegal labor and her pledge to be tough on illegal immigration. True, Whitman did fire the housekeeper, but the damage to her campaign has been done.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Whitman should probably not be faulted for this episode, which should not really have become a scandal at all. In the first place, it’s still unclear whether or not Whitman knew that Nicandra Diaz-Santillan was in California illegally.
Furthermore, I do not believe that Whitman truly has strong feelings on the illegal immigration issue. She has never tried to make it a driving point in her campaign, and nothing in her background suggests that it would be a major priority for her.
The campaign has been consistent in its emphasis on three main policy issues: creating jobs, cutting spending and fixing education. Addressing illegal immigration is at best peripherally relevant to these goals.
Instead, it is likely that Whitman took the stance on illegal immigration that was most politically expedient for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in California, namely to talk tough to appease the conservative base without presenting a real enough threat to alienate Latino voters or Californian agribusinesses, which are major constituencies that traditionally swing Republican.
What all this means for policy and the race is that if Whitman is elected, it is likely that very little will happen in regard to illegal immigration. The status quo will prevail as it has for so long because changing it would seriously disadvantage a number of groups. Maintaining it, on the other hand, does not do enough damage to send any politician out of office.
Thus, the immediate outcome from the Diaz-Santillan scandal is more of the same. However, the controversy also holds a greater lesson about the complicated nature of resolving illegal immigration.
Approximately 11 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States, about 3 million of which are in California. Right now, illegal immigrants are in what can best be described as a state of limbo.
Although the law says they are not permitted in this country and that they are subject to deportation, everyday reality shows that illegal immigrants are not likely to be sent home en masse because they provide labor crucial to our economy that many American citizens are unwilling to do.
Because of this, most illegal immigrants go about their daily lives in the same way as legal residents of the United States, although they often lack access to basic services and are constantly threatened by the black cloud of deportation.
There are two possible ways for policymakers to end the limbo — allow illegal immigrants to stay here legally, which means creating a pathway to citizenship, or undertake the major task of finding and deporting as many of them as possible.
Whitman’s “maidgate” story demonstrates the inherent problems with each of these solutions.
The only practical and sensible way to move illegal immigrants out of limbo is to somehow allow them to become citizens. Proponents of this view, however, should give due deference to the fair and logical sensibilities of the opposition, which many left-wing politicians today do not.
A pathway to citizenship would certainly solve the problem, but there is a large group of Americans who justifiably feel that it would be a blatant violation of the Constitution and undermine the rule of law. This viewpoint is hard to argue with because it is right — those who disagree generally do not contend that a pathway to citizenship is lawful, but only that it would be worth it.
Deporting our country’s illegal immigrants would be extremely difficult from a practical, political and economic standpoint.
However, more important is the fact demonstrated by Whitman’s story — it is easy to talk tough on illegal immigration in public forums but much more difficult to actually take actions against one who might be an employee, neighbor or friend.  It would take an unusually cold-hearted person to report an acquaintance as illegal to the authorities, an issue Whitman discovered personally while trying to uphold her stance on illegal immigration.
There is not now, or will there ever be, an easy answer to this country’s illegal immigration issue, which means that those who are working to solve it must be aware of each side’s concerns and search for the solution that causes the least harm to America’s economy and its public.

A semi-sensible piece from this writer for the first time this semester. However, as a close relative of a LEGAL immigrant who “Jumped through all the hoops” — I reject the idea that making them citizens is the answer. Before we even worry about deporting them, we should close the effin’ border to stop the hemorrhage.

One of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s final acts as governor of California could prove to be the one that defines his legacy. On Thursday, Schwarzenegger passed a series of major reform bills for healthcare, all of which supplement the federal legislation passed earlier this year.
California will also become the first state to implement an oversight board for insurance exchange marketplace since President Barack Obama’s sweeping federal healthcare law reform was passed. Being one of the first states in the nation to enact large-scale reform will make California an example, good or bad, for other states in terms of healthcare in the future.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
However, the inherent Catch-22 of social progress is that focusing on one area of policy usually comes at the neglect of another.
In this case, increased federal attention to healthcare hold the potential to damage California education, most explicitly through budget cuts. Although the government budget deficit might not affect USC students and the funding for our programs, it dramatically increases the strain on the University of California and California State University systems.
A $200 million budget deficit in the UC system stalled construction on $355 million of new infrastructure and cut UC admissions by 3,800 students. Meanwhile, faculty pay has gone down, and student tuition has gone up. Overall, the UCs are facing grim circumstances at best. Education has been and should always be a top priority for the state government, but spending money on healthcare implies less money for public education. This in turn means that less research can be done, fewer programs can be developed and more students will hesitate to attend a UC school because of financial concerns. All of these factors spell trouble for the public education system in California.
Though healthcare is indisputably an important cause, the federal government has already taken steps to amend that system. Education, however, remains the elephant in the room. Many levels of public education in California are in shambles, facing furlough days, lacking resources and other budget constraints that limit students’ educational experience.
The healthcare laws are positive steps to reform the system. They set a good precedent for other states to follow and allow more people access to affordable healthcare programs.
The laws are not the problem — they are based on solid principles and are concordant with federal government policy. In fact, they strengthen the legitimacy of Obama’s plan by showing that the state governments agree with the need to reform healthcare. Schwarzenegger advanced a bipartisan solution by spending on new programs. Republicans might oppose the bill by calling state-run programs “bureaucracy,” but the state’s decision to provide healthcare to as many people as possible is beneficial to those in need.
Above all, the budget is the biggest issue for the California government. Schwarzenegger leaves office with a huge deficit that will be a challenge for even the brightest economic minds.
California will not climb out of the budget crisis overnight. Falling further into debt harms many elements of the state’s government, but we need to find a way to keep a spotlight on education while healthcare is taking the attentions of both California’s public and its lawmakers.
At this point, the citizens and lawmakers of California might have to make a decision on what they value more: education or universal healthcare.
Cyrus Behzadi is a freshman majoring in communication.
Sell the UC system to pay for healthcare?
hell yea uc’s are going down the drain. walkout on thurs for budget cuts! everyone march out of berkeley! GO BEARS

A new name will hit comic book and graphic novel shelves — and it’s an already familiar one.
Far from staying with the cliché story of tortured and impossible love set up by her debut novel The Time Traveler’s Wife — which fittingly became a film in 2009 starring The Notebook’s Rachel McAdams — Audrey Niffenegger has shown a recent trend toward more unconventional and sinister topics. Her second novel, enigmatically entitled “Her Fearful Symmetry,” was a chill-inducing tale of a ghost and a cemetery.
Readers can no longer dismiss or categorize her as a romance novelist, as the author continues to branch out with the release of “The Night Bookmobile,” a graphic novel which she illustrated herself. The story details Alexandra’s strange encounter with a supernatural bookmobile — a Winnebago filled with tomes — which includes Alexandra’s diary.
If the book’s subject matter and the author’s effort in both writing and illustrating don’t lend it enough credibility, how about some kudos from iconic graphic novel writer Neil Gaiman?
The writer endorsed Niffeneger’s latest creation, describing it as “beautifully drawn and perfectly told.”
At only 40 pages, the graphic novel might be a fleeting brief glimpse into the ingenious visual and literary mind of Niffenegger or simply a side project meant as a break from other literary works.
Niffenegger’s inclusion brings an interesting feminine touch to the otherwise testosterone-driven world of graphic novels and comic books. And it shows that writers need not constrict themselves to one particular genre.
Comic book world, meet Audrey Niffenegger.

Though USC hit its first speed bump of the year this Saturday with a last-second loss to Washington, the weekend was not a complete waste for the Trojans, as local Dorsey High School junior Jaydon Mickens made a verbal commitment to play for USC.
Mickens is 5-foot-11, 176 pounds, and is an incredibly versatile athlete, playing slot receiver and wildcat quarterback this year for Dorsey, which has previously produced former USC stars such as former wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson and running back Stafon Johnson.
The local prospect looks forward to showcasing all of his talents at USC and believes he can help the program in several different ways.
“I plan to go there as an athlete,” said Mickens.  “I can play running back, slot receiver, kickoff returner or wildcat quarterback.  I can do everything.”
Mickens, who already has 13 receptions for 231 yards with two touchdowns this season, said he is excited to be staying local by committing to USC as it gives him a chance to play in front of friends and family.
“The thing about USC that stands out is that they always have great athletes and I want to be one of those great athletes,” Mickens said.  “It’s not too far from home so my family and friends can come see me.”
Mickens’ verbal commitment makes him the third player in USC’s 2012 class, and he is glad to finally be relieved of the weight of his decision.
“People wanted to know. . . where I was going to play my college ball.  It’s just a great experience to know that I am going to go to USC,” he said.

Three years ago, the Stanford Cardinal stepped onto the field of Coliseum as a 41-point underdog and walked away victorious with a 24-23 win over the Trojans on a late touchdown strike.
On Saturday, the Washington Huskies — the same team that upset the Trojans last year in Seattle — also walked into the Trojans’ house and left them battered and bruised after a win thanks to another late score.
With three losses in their past five home games, the Trojans no longer seem formidable in their own home.  Just a few years ago the Trojans were flying high with a 35-game home winning streak, embodying the reign of a USC football dynasty under then-head coach Pete Carroll.
The sudden regime change seemed to leave USC in a state of bewilderment.  Even with an announced crowd of just more than 80,000, the Trojans could not rattle Washington kicker Eric Folk, who calmly silenced the crowd and sent the Trojan faithful home dazed and confused.
Now, many are doubting that the Coliseum is a source of intimidation or fear.
USC coach Lane Kiffin attributes this loss of intimidation to the type of play that the Trojans have recently been experiencing.
“I don’t think teams are intimidated playing us because we’re not playing very well,” Kiffin said. “The players haven’t played well enough to where guys are in fear of playing them.”

As elections approach this November, Democrats face challenges to rally support, but according to a recent poll, can count on support from the Hispanic population.
Figures released by the Pew Hispanic Center today found 51 percent of registered Latino voters is certain that they will vote in November and 65 percent said they plan to vote Democratic.
“The Latino vote appears to continue to strongly identify with the Democratic Party,” Mark Lope, Pew Hispanic Center’s associate director, told The Huffington Post.
However, although Democrats expect support from the Hispanic community, the controversy surrounding immigration law in Arizona still leaves almost half of registered Hispanic voters not voting in November, according to The New York Times.
“Latinos feel that on many of their key issues, promises were made and delivered on by the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats,” Matt Barreto, a professor and pollster for the advocacy and research group Latino Decisions, told The Times.
Though Latino voters supported Obama more than two to one in the 2008 presidential election, given the current economic situation in the United States and general anger among voters, Democrats might not be confident in its supporters this November, The Huffington Post reported.

Is there a better way to feel pampered than to lounge in a fancy restaurant and be served a three-course meal on fine china? Unless you’ve got a rich daddy, it’s hard for a college student to revel in such indulgences.
Thank goodness for dineLA Restaurant Week.
This two-week dining event brings specially priced three-course menus from some of the best (that means expensive) restaurants in Los Angeles. It  kick-started Sunday and will run until Oct. 8, and again from Oct. 10-15.
Participating restaurants, several of them just a 10-minute drive away in Downtown Los Angeles, will offer lunches priced at $16, $22 or $28, and dinners at $26, $34 or $44.
Better start making your reservations soon — though you don’t need tickets or passes for this event, dineLA is popular enough that you might not be able to score seats. Take a look at the complete list of participating restaurants and drool over their menus here. But wait — there’s more good news.
Today, from 6 to 8 p.m. at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at L.A. Live, there will be a free pass to view the dineLA Quickfire Challenge finale in live action.
Yes, you get to watch four major chefs — Chef Mark Peel of Campanile and The Tar Pit, Chef Akira Hirose of Maison Akira, Chef Octavio Becerra of Palate Food + Wine, and Chef Eric Greenspan of The Foundry on Melrose — squirm as they compete to create their interpretation of the perfect dessert. Talk about a sweet deal.
The judges will be Wolfgang Puck Worldwide Executive Pastry Chef Sherry Yard, Los Angeles Times Food Editor Russ Parsons, and Chef and Owner of Angeli Caffe and host of KCRW’s Good Food, Evan Kleiman.
The event is free, but you will probably want to order a drink (or two). Specialty cocktails will be available for $8, including $6 appetizer specials such as sliders, stuffed peppers, chicken wings, fried calamari, and marghertia pizzas.
For foodies with fancier palates, you can also try the spicy tuna tartar and heirloom tomatoes with burrata, also for just $6.
Food lovers rejoice.
