This week on “Rhythm and News,” our hosts Kamryn Tate, Kirsten Hawkins, and Ryan Skidmore discuss the new beginnings of live music performance in the post-lockdown era. Has the quality of performance changed? Has there been a shift in music culture? Is it safe to attend concerts? Can we even afford it any more? These questions are discussed, topics are addressed and the ultimate question is, “are we gonna be outside this summer?”
Hosted and Written by Kamryn Tate, Kirsten Hawkins and Ryan Skidmore. Edited by Abbey Park and Ryan Skidmore. Produced by Grace Ingram.

Students, alumni and recruiters gathered at Lewis Hall Thursday for the Price School of Public Policy’s annual career fair. The event, organized by the Price Office of Career Services, aims to connect students to the Trojan Network and empower them through the process of finding a career that suits their interests. 
More than 15 employers — ranging from city management departments, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Los Angeles Police Department, the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation — set up booths at the event, fielding student questions and promoting openings at their respective departments. 
Elana Buegoff, pier administrator at the Economic Development Division in the City of Santa Monica, said she was excited to help students with their questions about career development and growth. 
“I got my start in local government through an internship, and I wanted to make opportunities available for USC students to also explore a career in local government,” Buegoff said. 
Elana said her passion also stems from being a Price alum, having received her master’s degrees in public administration and urban planning at the school in 1997. 
Patricia Ayestas, recruitment support specialist for the Secret Service, said she has been attending the career fair the past 10 years and USC students are regularly hired. The agency is currently recruiting college students and graduates for their Special Agent Talent & Achievement Recruitment program. 
Dominic Alletto, associate director of employer relations for the Price Office of Career Services, said that, like “any in-person event,” the fair would have a “large impact on helping students gain employment and internship opportunities.”
“We’re happy to broker those opportunities between our students and employer partners,” Alletto said. “We also had plenty of alumni here, so it’s great for them to come back, connect with current students and help bring them into their organizations.”
Deryck Avya Maioli, a graduate student studying public administration, said the event was a meaningful opportunity for students to connect with Trojan alumni.
“First of all, the Career Services staff is wonderful,” Maioli said. “They’re staffed with people who really care, who want to help all students, whether they’re in their first year or whether they’re just graduating.”
A virtual fair will take place April 6.

Gertrude’s music exists at the crossroads of rap and rhythm & blues; it lies somewhere between empowering and brutally honest. Most importantly, her music highlights her intersectional identities as a Black woman and how she stays true to herself in the face of discrimination.
Gertrude is a moniker for Sasha-Courtney Hofisi, a junior majoring in music industry. While Hofisi got her start in rock and pop punk music, her recent tracks, released under the name Gertrude, reflect a more melodic rap sound.
Growing up in San Diego, Gertrude immersed herself in Southern California’s rock band scene. Her early music drew inspiration from the live shows she frequented, as well as bands who hail from San Diego, including Blink-182.
“Listening to bands is the reason why I started honing in on guitar as my main instrument other than voice,” Gertrude said. “[There is a] culture in Southern California of attending shows. I feel like everybody has a little backyard DIY band, and I think being involved in that culture and going to shows with my friends definitely put me in a position to start putting my music out there.”
One of Gertrude’s first ventures into making music was a band she started with her friends in middle school called “6 Minutes of Winter,” based on their shared love of the band 5 Seconds of Summer. 
“We were all really obsessed with 5SOS and a lot of early 2000s pop punk music,” Gertrude said. “It was a lot of trial and error. It was a lot of showing up to each other’s houses and banging on drums and guitar and trying to record covers. But when I really think back to the first time in my music career so far that I was really putting myself out there, it was around that time.”
During her sophomore year at USC, Gertrude found herself drawn to creating rap and R&B.
“With a lot of the protests that were going on in 2020, I was feeling more distant from rock and alternative music,” Gertrude said. “I felt more drawn to Black genres as a listener, but also especially for myself and feeling more empowered [as a musician].”
Gertrude also drew on her experiences growing up in San Diego as one of few Black people in her community.
“The neighborhood and the community and the high school I went to was in a super white area, and as a result I experienced a lot of childhood bullying,” Gertrude said. “A lot of my experiences from being in that environment have been starting to come out in my music.”
Her single “Chick,” released June of lasy year, details her experiences with interracial dating. She sings, “Look at me with them teeny tight curls / All he wants is his world / And his diamonds and pearls and a little white girl.”
“[‘Chick’ is] a heartbreak song about me experiencing dealing with racial dating politics as a Black woman and dating outside my race and knowing that I wasn’t necessarily the object of desirability,” Gertrude said. “That story specifically stemmed from my time after high school, but that song definitely encapsulated my experience starting back to when I was growing up at a predominantly white high school.”
Her most recent release, “guilty,” which came out in November of last year, interrogates the complex feelings she has about putting herself and her career first. Gertrude will also be releasing a remix of the track with a new verse from rapper JAYKAYPRIME!, the artist name of Jephtha Prempeh, a recent USC graduate.
“I just loved it immediately, so I decided to write to it before she had even asked me to. It’s this quintessential early ’20s record about hedonism,” Prempeh said. “Whether you call it hedonism or reclaiming your time, I really resonated with this feeling of people having expectations around me, but for me to even keep my head above water sometimes I have to just close myself off to make sure that I get what I need to get done, done.”
Gertrude’s passion for performing live stuck with her, even though her genre shifted. Her father, Tapera Hofisi, recalls attending many of her performances across San Diego.
“In the beginning, we found an open mic. We would go there pretty much every week. She would perform at those alone, and sometimes she’d perform with friends,” the elder Hofisi said. “She’s great at what she does and not only does she talk about it, but she makes things happen … She’s a rockstar.”
Gertrude has performed all over San Diego and, more recently, at Los Angeles venues, such as the Silverlake Lounge and The Rattle L.A.
“It’s one of the main reasons why I make music, for live performance … My soul leaves my body in a way where I just forget that I’m on stage or what has happened because I’m just so in the moment, or I feel like I’m almost in a trance by performing,” Gertrude said. “It’s wild because I’ll come back from a show or be talking to people after a show who are like, ‘that was so great,’ but I don’t even remember what I did. It’s just very, very fulfilling.”
Gertrude’s strength lies in her individuality and genuine candor about her experiences, Prempeh said.
“Aside from just really admiring Sasha-Courtney as a person and as a friend, I think that Gertrude as an artist really speaks to showing up as yourself unapologetically,” Prempeh said. “Especially in this day and age, women in rap are expected to [have a] super brash and glossy and polished image with that kind of hood sensibility. And I feel like Gertrude has made this transition from this very white, indie rock space into rap and made it her own by sticking to a more punk or grungy ethos.”

Sad girls everywhere rejoiced with the release of boygenius’ highly anticipated debut album “the record,” collectively producing enough tears to rival Los Angeles’ recent rain spell. Gen Z’s equivalent of Traveling Wilburys, the supergroup of generation-defining musicians — Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus — has stirred up quite a riot with its unexpected comeback, having only previously released its self-titled EP in 2018. 
Amid the excitement, it’s crucial to recognize the groups of women who paved the way for modern ensembles like boygenius. The following musicians developed a soundtrack of womanhood that has guided generations of young women from adolescence through adulthood, teaching them lessons on independence, community, love and empowerment. Thus follows the unofficial tale of the troupes who started it all the Girl Band Bible. 
Girl Group Genesis 
In the beginning, there were men. 
Popular music was saturated with male performers in the early 20th century and, though women were respected as talented vocalists, it was rare that they were recognized as much more than a pretty voice. However, as World War II brought a current of newfound autonomy for women in the United States, all-female jazz bands, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, swept the nation, paving the way for their successors. 
The momentous emergence of rock ’n‘ roll throughout the ’50s and ’60s saw the realization of the “girl group” and, with new acts regularly coming onto the scene, it was as if they were raining down from the heavens themselves. All sharing spots on the top of the charts, groups like The Supremes, The Marvelettes and The Crystals became household names. Their angelic harmonies and synchronized choreography charmed the world’s radio and television sets with an intoxicating influence that inspired even the likes of The Beatles, who covered the Marvelettes’ number one hit “Please Mr. Postman” on the band’s second record “With the Beatles.”  
Feminine Rage
An overarching, teenage dissatisfaction with the state of society sparked the onslaught of punk in the late ’70s. Acts like Kleenex — later LiLiPUT — and The Slits broke through the mostly white-male noise, and alongside X-Ray Spex frontwoman Poly Styrene — though backed by an all-male band — defined what it meant to be a woman in punk, with unapologetic, passionate expressions of their shared discontent.
This ethos would make quite the comeback in the ’90s, with bands such as L7 and Babes in Toyland following in the footsteps left by their predecessors, both maintaining that legacy and cementing their own. 
Simultaneously, conceived among local feminist and activist communities, Riot Grrrl hit the national stage like a slap in the face with a sound bigger than Goliath himself. Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Sleater-Kinney fronted the movement that would evolve into a touchstone for third wave feminism. Their brutally raw lyrics and exhilarating performances taught the world the true meaning of “girl power,” a term coined in Riot Grrrl zines — only later appropriated and commodified by the public. 
The Second Coming: Girl Group Resurrection
Throughout the ’70s and ’80s, girl groups maintained their status as heralds of popular music and culture. Groups like LaBelle, The Pointer Sisters and Sister Sledge defined the reign of disco and soul, while Bananarama, The Go-Go’s, The Bangles and The Runaways prospered in the era of neon-clad mall rats and MTV. 
Though they never really left, girl groups truly made their comeback in form, scope and status with the pop stars of the ’90s. The age of the girl group had resurrected, as listeners spiced up their lives to the tunes of Spice Girls, TLC and Destiny’s Child while southern sensation The Chicks brought country to the main stage, all becoming international sensations and pop culture icons within the decade.  
Undercurrents
Among all of the pop groups and Riot Grrrls of the ’90s and 2000s, there lies an undercurrent: the indie and alternative. Alternative supergroup The Breeders and dream pop duo Azure Ray parted the sea of upbeat hits, expressing a more solemn discontent compared to their punk contemporaries, juxtaposing brighter-sounding indie rock acts such as Plumtree, Look Blue Go Purple and Shonen Knife.
A New Testament: Girl Bands of Today
Though a majority of current college students were introduced to girl bands by the pop groups of the 2010s like Fifth Harmony and Little Mix, modern girl bands continue to thrive. HAIM and boygenius are some of today’s more recognized names, as well as internationally recognized K-pop stars like BLACKPINK and Girls’ Generation, but there’s a multitude of strong contenders spread throughout all genres of popular music. Whether it be punk bands Dream Wife and Girl Friday, R&B groups like Chloe x Halle and FLO, indie rock bands like Hinds and Wet Leg or country acts like Plains and Runaway June, girl groups are seeped into popular music and here to stay. 
And a very special shoutout to USC’s very own girl band, GRL!! 
Take this as a starting point, a baptismal introduction to the endless talent found in girl groups, girl bands and frontwomen. Don’t forget to spread the good news in the name of the mother, the daughter and of the feminist spirit, girl power.

Autumn Bryant began writing music at six years old, lining the pages of her taco-themed Justice notebook with short verses. 
Since then, Bryant, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, has dreamed of becoming not just a singer, but a performer, saving what she sees as the dying art of performance.
“The difference between a singer and a performer is just that engagement with the crowd,” Bryant said. “It’s easy to sit and sing your song and sway back and forth, but it’s harder to really get the audience engaged with you when you’re singing … That’s what makes the iconic singers of our time [and] before our time so legendary.”
Growing up involved in musical theater, Bryant, who releases music under the name Autumn Stallia, a coy jab at her 5-foot-2-inch frame, was no stranger to performing. However, the transition from theater to concerts was not easy, with Bryant frightened by the fact she was no longer able to“hide behind the mask of a character.”
It was only last September that Stallia performed her music for the first time after receiving an invitation from her friend, Sultan Lugboso, to perform at a FREE99 event on campus.
“At first I was gonna say no, because I was like, ‘That sounds like my worst nightmare,’” Stallia said. “But I was like, ‘Okay, Autumn, if this is something that you really want to do, this is a great chance to break out of your shell.’”
Since then, she has performed at five FREE99 concerts and a fashion show. Before the semester ends, Stallia hopes to headline her own concert on campus. 
In February, Stallia released her EP “WONDERGIRL,” a nod to a nickname given to her by her father.   
“If you listen to the EP, it’s under the genre of pop. But you’ll hear one of the songs is like a rock song or like some R&B or some rap, a little alternative stuff,” Stallia said. “It’s eclectic, and it’s also a representation of who I am. I like doing a bunch of different stuff. I have a lot of interests. My music taste is like a rainbow. And I feel like that’s kind of just who I am. ‘Wondergirl, she can do it all.’”
Taking inspiration from the likes of Michael Jackson, Doja Cat, Selena and Kendrick Lamar, Stallia, although describing herself as a “pop girly,” refuses to confine herself to a single genre. Whatever style will allow her to achieve her artistic vision, she will do, refusing to hide herself away. 
“I’m inspired by all of [those artists], because I feel like I really respect artists who are unapologetically themselves because I think it’s really hard to just be like, ‘This is who I am. And this is how I will be represented in this world and industry,’” Stallia said. “I’m trying to channel that as I grow as an artist now.”
Currently, Stallia’s production process requires her to do it all. After writing her music in the “wee hours of the morning,” she records the songs in her bedroom, using a microphone she purchased from Amazon. Then, it is similarly on her to produce and mix each song. 
Her songwriting inspiration all comes from her own life, she uses her music to make sense of how she is feeling at the time she sits down to write. While her songs can be deeply personal, she never forgets her audience. 
“As a listener, my favorite songs are the ones where I feel so connected to the lyrics where I’m like, ‘Ah, this artist 
understands me,’” Stallia said. “My subconscious goal when I’m writing is like, ‘I know that this is how I feel. And there are going to be some people out there that are like, ‘Autumn, I feel the same way, girl.’’”
Haylee Clophus, a sophomore majoring in journalism, met Stallia during her freshman year and has followed her music journey ever since. 
“I love that Autumn’s music is really a reflection of who she is,” Clophus said. “She’s a bright, bubbly, outgoing person. Anybody that meets her will say the same thing. And her music is really bright and funky.”
Clophus was always interested in singing, but it wasn’t until Stallia invited her to perform a verse on “Above All” that she gave it a shot, finding that their friendship eased the nerves that had previously stopped her from performing. 
“Above All” was Stallia’s second time working with another artist, the first being on her song “We Fall Apart” with Jalen Short. 
The pair met at a FREE99 event and, as soon as he saw her perform, Short, a sophomore majoring communication, immediately knew “[he] had to get on a song with her.”
“She has a very good falsetto, her runs are really impressive,” Short said. “I got to hear her whole process of artistry, because I wasn’t there when she recorded ‘We Fall Apart.’ So, hearing that process was really dope.”
Following “We Fall Apart,” Short invited Stallia to feature on his upcoming EP, and said he hoped their future as collaborators reaches the levels of those of Kanye and Rihanna.
Stallia plans to continue pursuing her dream of performance, and between music videos and concerts, she shows no signs of slowing down, hoping to continue sharing relatable messages through music. 
“Releasing your fears to the world is always hard to do, but I think I enjoy it because it’s an outlet for me to just get my emotions out there,” Stallia said. “I know that there are people listening that probably also relate. It’s more of a relief to put my vulnerable personal words out into the universe.”

Members of the USC Society of Women in Law gathered at Taper Hall Wednesday to glimpse into their future. The event was intimate and the classroom was filled with students eager to hear about what a career could potentially look like for them as women in law. 
The Black Women in Law Panel featured practicing Black lawyers from the Black Women Lawyers Association and aimed to inform SWIL members about the BWL. 
The panel also facilitated an environment where attendees could learn about the journey to become lawyers from practicing Black women in various legal fields, said Lynce Polidor, the director of equity at SWIL. 
“It often is really hard to find other women, especially Black women, to look up to as someone who wants to go into law,” said Polidor, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “I also really want other women to understand what Black women experience with intersectionality.”
In 1975, a small group of Los Angeles-based African American attorneys and judges met and voiced the need for an organization that addressed their needs as Black women. Jasmine Horton, a USC alum and current president of the Black Women Lawyers Association in L.A., said that the focus of the BWL is to create space for Black women lawyers trying to advocate for and pursue justice. The organization hosts bonding meetings and events for members, gives its members the opportunity to work on pro-bono cases and offers bar-prep for law school graduates, among other initiatives. 
USC alum and in-house employment counsel at AT&T, Uche Anene, and associate at Filer Palmer LLP attorney Paige Poupart both sat on Wednesday’s panel. They recalled their experiences as undergraduates looking to go to law school and answered questions from the audience about gap years, bar exam prep and intersectionality between the various fields of law. 
During the panel, each of the panelists shared some pieces of wisdom they wish they had known before starting law school. Anene said she wished she had planned her journey better and had started networking earlier to better set herself up for success. 
“You’re not only just building [relationships] when you’re in law school, but also [building] some legal relationships prior to coming to law school. So you create a pipeline for yourself for internships and for people that can give you encouragement or advice,” Anene said. 
When students asked what they should consider when making their decision to attend law school, Horton suggested that undergraduates intern for practicing lawyers to decide whether they want to go into that environment. They also urged students to consider if they are comfortable taking out student loans. 
“I wouldn’t do law school until I’m at least 75% sure you want to just because it’s a big financial expense,” Horton said. “When I was a student here, I actually worked at a law firm Downtown in between classes … [for a guy] who was an alum.”
The lawyers shared their experiences as Black women working in the legal field and spoke about dealing with discrimination in predominantly male spaces. 
“It’s primarily in court … you’re dealing with actual cases and it’s an adversarial process,” Anene said. “The adversarial side is filled with men and often men that love to man-speak and it happens everywhere … If a man says [something], then they take you seriously after you’ve already said it like maybe ten times.”
Poupart said she has felt dismissed both because of her Black identity and her womanhood, as racism and misogyny compound.
“I have, definitely, because I’ve always just considered my woman-ness in terms of my Blackness and they have never been separate as a Black woman,” Poupart said. “Black men don’t have the same trouble as I do.”
Deborah Brittain, a sophomore majoring in public policy, said the event gave her a clear picture of who she could be.
“I knew this would be important and something that deeply affects me as a Black woman and I really enjoyed it,” Brittain said. “I really enjoyed looking at my own alumna being up there … They made me have a clearer picture [in] my head of what my future could look like, and what I need to do and that I have resources to get there so I shouldn’t be afraid to use them.”

Over the last 20 years, the esports industry has evolved for women — in a positive way. Women are now more included than ever, not only as athletes but also as managers and high-level executives of the biggest names and organizations in the industry. Women can now be coaches of world-class professional esports teams, experienced commentators and skilled analysts of the biggest tournament circuits in the world. 
Just two years ago, Riot Games announced that it would be creating a new tournament circuit and program named VCT Game Changers. The VCT Game Changers series is an A-Tier tournament that has set a new standard for equality and inclusivity in the esports industry for the better, showing the world that women are skilled enough to compete at a high level.
While there have been women-only tournaments in the past — including “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive”’s counterpart, the ESL Impact Cash Cups — “VALORANT” is at the front of the industry in terms of embodying the spirit of equality both online and offline. 
Riot Games put in the effort and money to increase promotion, bring the tournament to a global scale, commit resources to high-quality production and pledge an unprecedented prize pool for a women’s-only tournament — $500,000 for the 2022 VCT Game Changers Championship versus a measly $1,000 for ESL Impact Cash Cups in each region. 
While $500,000 is a huge prize pool, it’s still only half of the VALORANT Champions tournament prize pool, which stood at $1 million last year. Although Riot Games has certainly made considerable progress in promoting and protecting the inclusivity of women through VCT Game Changers, the game of money still hasn’t changed — ironically. 
At the non-player level, women have entered the scene with a bang, but at the player level, not so much. Big-name gaming corporations and professional esports teams have unbelievably large budgets, but only a small fraction of the digital pie goes to women. No women appear among the top 300 highest-earning esports players and the top 400 women in esports combined earn less than half of what the top-earning man, “Dota 2” player Johan “N0tail” Sundstein, makes. 
Forget the wage gap: This is a wage abyss. 
“It’s a man’s sport! Women can’t play video games,” groans the typical G FUEL-swilling, Cheetos-dusted finger-wielding keyboard warrior who makes up the gaming industry’s loudest online presence. But the myth of women being worse than men at video games has long been debunked. 
A study of thousands of players in two massively multiplayer online role-playing games led by a researcher at UC Davis found that women advance as fast and perform as well as men do: Gender makes no difference in gaming skill. 
So, why is misinformation still widely recognized as a reason why women aren’t in the highest echelon of tournaments and playing at the highest caliber of esports? Why haven’t we tried to balance men and women in the “great equalizer” of sports? 
Yes, women-only tournaments have done wonders to promote inclusivity by creating safe spaces, instilling role models for younger gamers and creating a pathway for women esports talent to pursue their dreams. But while women-only tournaments have been a solution in advocating for equality in the past — it’s time for a change. 
Guaranteeing a spot for women in high-profile tournaments is the complete opposite of the solution, as it will only breed even more discrimination and misogyny. Women-only tournaments, despite providing the aforementioned space for women to compete, also to a certain extent, show that women need a closed tournament — one without men — to succeed. 
Now that we have proven that women are just as skilled as their male counterparts, it’s time to start not only advocating, but also supporting women to enter the bigger and better-paying competitions that are dominated by men. 
Cloud9 White was one of the first women’s teams in “VALORANT” and dominated the scene for nearly two years under the banner of one of the most profitable esports franchises in history. The former in-game leader of the now disbanded superteam, Melanie “meL” Capone, expressed the importance of having a “quality approach” to women in the professional scene in a BBC interview. 
Capone also cited the need for “not just the exposure and just signing the team, but also having a coach, secondary coach, an analyst, a really good manager and just a lot of support from the organization in general.” 
The top men’s teams have an abundance of support — just take a look at 100 Thieves’ “VALORANT” roster. Fully equipped with a highly skilled team of a general manager, head coach, assistant coach and a team of analysts, the roster has seen thousands of dollars of success, achieving top three positions in A- and S-tier tournaments since the roster’s inception in 2020. 
Compare that to last year’s VCT Game Changers winners, G2 Gozen, who only have a team manager, coach and team manager intern — yes, an intern managing a world-class women’s professional esports team — even though G2 is one of the largest and most profitable professional esports organizations on the planet. This is a world of difference in support systems. 
Women need a solid support system to even have a seat at the table, to even have the opportunity to compete at the highest echelon of esports. With a strong support system, women have the opportunity to prove themselves by entering the longest-standing and most prestigious circuits and tournaments in the world — and, hopefully, winning. 
By entering distinguished tournament circuits, such as the “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive” IEM tournaments and the “League of Legends” World Championship, bigger prize pools will be available for women to fill up the wage canyon that has existed since the dawn of esports. 
While the esports industry has evolved for the better, the name of the game — equality — hasn’t changed. With corporations and esports organizations having gargantuan budgets, the biggest names in esports have the capability to give these women the support they need to fight for a name, place and a living in the industry. After organizations make that first step, talent, skill and finesse will prove themselves.

You know that one friend that you meet at a very young age, whom you plan your entire life out with and with whom you somehow never manage to lose contact? That was Erin for me. We had met in kindergarten, although we didn’t become close until second grade. But once we had decided that we were BFFs, there was no stopping us or our futures together.
We decided around the age of 8 that we would go to the University of Michigan together. We would be roommates, of course. We had many-a-sleepover filled with only the best snacks — popcorn, candy, the works — where we would discuss our futures in great detail. We were both extremely academically driven, taking as many advanced classes together as we could. 
At the end of fifth grade, she told me that she was moving to Manchester, England with her family because of her mom’s work. I proceeded to have a breakdown. I was so inconsolable that my parents drove me almost two hours to Ann Arbor just to eat at my favorite restaurant. 
She was in England for three years, coming back to Michigan to visit once or twice. Ironically, we ended up in Dubai over winter break at the same time in sixth grade, and we spent the day at the Atlantis, The Palm resort together with our families. 
Erin came back to Michigan for one year during freshman year of high school. Unfortunately, I don’t think I ever met up with her. 
After that one year, she moved to Pennsylvania with her family and spent the rest of her high school career there. But, still, we never lost contact or love for each other.
In another series of coincidences, we ended up in Detroit at the same time a few weeks before the beginning of college, and by a stroke of luck, met up for breakfast. We talked about what this new chapter in our lives was going to look like. She was going to attend Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and me, USC. 
Even though we were nowhere near each other, or going to the University of Michigan together, we were both so proud of each other. She had discovered her love of mathematics, and I had found my love of writing. We were both going to succeed in our own rights, and it was exciting. 
Her 18th birthday was a few weeks later, Sept. 15, and I wished her a happy birthday like I had every year since we were 6. 
And on Sept. 20, 2021, just five days later, I learned that she had passed away the day before because of an ATV accident. I saw it on a mutual friend’s Instagram story. 
I was hysterical. My memory of that night flashes in and out, but I remember ending up on the floor of my neighbor’s dorm, unable to communicate what had happened. Although it was late at night, and later back home in Michigan, I frantically called my mom once I was able to recognize the people and things around me. Thankfully, she picked up. 
We cried together on the phone. She had learned before me; Erin’s parents had called her to explain what had happened. She just had no idea how to tell me, so she didn’t. 
I flew back home for her funeral a few days later. I was asked to speak during the service and, through tears, I did. 
It’s common knowledge that people compartmentalize grief in different ways. I usually don’t cry about her loss anymore — the last time I did is when I stayed with her parents for a few days this past winter break — and I love sharing her life story, about how crazy smart she was, how tall she was, how sporty she was (she had been an amazing soccer goalie all her life, even playing for her college’s team for the short time she attended) and how incredibly kind she was. 
My little sisters, who grew up with Erin’s influence, admired her in unimaginable ways. My youngest sister, who’s now 12, took up soccer and keeps a picture of Erin in her athletics bag at all times. 
Strangely, my grief managed to manifest itself in my dreams. Even though it’s been a year and a half, I still have dreams with Erin in them with relative frequency. I should actually call them nightmares, as in almost every one of these instances I’m aware that she’s not here in real life. I try to hold onto her memory during these nights as long as I can. 
Erin motivates me and inspires me every day. Not only did she show me that life is too short and too unpredictable, but that, honestly, everything’s going to be okay. My best friend’s waiting for me in the end.

My great-great-grandfather, Salomón Drucaroff, was one of the many hundreds of thousands of Jews escaping the pogroms of the Russian Empire to land in Argentina at the turn of the 20th century. Upon arrival, he and 30 others were given an infertile plot of land on which to establish a new life and, in 1905, they founded the town of Rivera on the outskirts of the Buenos Aires province. 
Legend has it that, when building the town, its inhabitants first wanted to erect a synagogue, but Salomón, a well-respected man, insisted on first constructing a school. Per his word, Rivera came together to establish the town primary school, founding the town on a precedent of educational valoration.
Salomón Drucaroff had three children: Sara, Berta and Sansón. Berta, my “bisabuela,” was to embody Salomón’s single-minded pursuit of education, eventually earning a degree in biochemistry — something next to unheard of in the country at the time.
As Rivera grew, Salomón purchased cows and established a butchery. Every morning, at the crack of dawn, Berta would roll out of bed and help her father prepare various cuts of beef for sale, later heading to the local primary school, which she attended from a young age. She would continue the same routine every morning, aiding in the butcher shop to be able to support her going to school.
When the children of Rivera were of the age to attend secondary school, the town found itself without the resources to establish one. Lacking a formal school to attend, students had to demonstrate their scholastic competence by taking an annual standardized assessment distributed in a larger city. To allow their children the opportunity to graduate secondary school, the townspeople invited a teacher from Morocco to prepare students for the exams. 
After months of preparation and study every year, Berta would travel to the nearest city by train to take her exam. After receiving their degrees, it was common practice for the men to leave town and attend university, while women were taught to be content with even being educated up to that point. The Drucaroffs, however, would not be ones to conform to common practice.
In the 1930s, following her older sister, Sara, Berta moved nearly 600 kilometers to Rosario, Argentina to study at its university. The two stayed with their relatives and, for years, both slept in a single room, cramped together, with Sansón eventually joining them. 
In spite of the conditions, there were never complaints — they never had it easy up until that point anyway. Back in Rivera, Salomón’s neighbors told him that he was crazy to even have thought of sending his daughters away to study at a university. But he knew what he was doing.
Berta, after earning her degree in pharmacy, pursued further education to become a biochemist. She would meet Manuel Horenstein, whom she married and with whom she eventually would move to Mendoza, Argentina to practice. There she became the chief of the laboratory at the Hospital Central of Mendoza, the largest hospital in the city, for decades until retirement.
Berta did her part in normalizing women’s education by demonstrating that it can be done through grit and tenacity. She traveled hundreds of kilometers to take tests and, further yet, earn a university degree. She was a first-generation immigrant from a town that had been founded on a barren plot of dirt eight years before she was born. 
Astoundingly, beyond the practical challenges, she met little outright resistance in her pursuit of what was then seen as a man’s schooling, in large part due to the steadfast support of her father, who understood the value of a degree from a standpoint of pure pragmatism. Salomón said that the best inheritance he could leave for his daughters was an education, since it would allow them to provide for themselves. He loved his children and wanted to guarantee their stability without him, and he saw scholarship as their best shot at a fulfilling life.
In all of her toil, Berta never thought of herself as “pobrecita” — never once thought “woe is me” — just because she was a woman. Berta saw obstacles and worked around them. She had a vision for what her future could be. 
But for all of her achievements, she only got so far because she stood on the shoulders of those who supported her, from her father to her relatives in Rosario. It was because of their support and vision that Berta was able to dictate her own story. History does not happen in a vacuum — change is not the labor of the individual but the community. 
They say it takes a village to raise a child. It also takes one to make history.

History in general, and especially history about marginalized communities, can become too repetitive, shining light on the same individuals from textbook to textbook, lecture to lecture. Our history books and classes have mostly celebrated men who have had meaningful impacts in our world, often leaving out women who contributed immensely to society. 
Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Katherine Johnson and Malala Yousafzai are all extraordinary women in history who you’ve probably heard about. If you haven’t, please look them up … like now! Although we might have learned these names in classes or from the news, there are so many more unrecognized phenomenal women with whom you should absolutely familiarize yourself with. 
Trưng Sisters (unknown – AD 43)
Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị, known as the Trưng sisters, headed a rebellion against the Chinese Han Dynasty overlords and established a self-ruling state. The Han Chinese invaded what is now Vietnam in 111 BC. To fight against Chinese rule, the two sisters banded together with about 80,000 soldiers consisting of peasants and aristocrats. 
The sisters marched on Lien Lau, the commandery capital of Vietnam, armed with swords, bows, arrows, axes and spears. After successfully driving the Chinese out of the region, Trắc was declared queen of a newly independent country and ran Vietnam alongside her sister.
Dr. Jane Cooke Wright (1919 – 2013)
Wright was a professor of surgery, head of the cancer chemotherapy department and associate dean at New York Medical College. She was also the first woman to be elected as the president of the New York Cancer Society, and had a major breakthrough in medicine. 
Wright tested chemicals for effective anti-cancer properties on leukemia and other cancers. Her work on these cancers established the effectiveness of methotrexate, a medication that slows the growth of cancer cells, in treating breast cancer. Wright’s research drastically advanced cancer treatment and laid the foundation for treating tumors with the help of chemotherapy. 
Dolores Huerta (1930 – Present)
Huerta was a labor activist, civil rights leader and the co-founder of the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farmers of America. As a teacher, she saw that many children of farm workers came to school hungry, so she left her job to help her students’ parents earn more equitable wages and working conditions.
Huerta helped organize a strike of 5,000 grape workers, which eventually led to a successful union contract for farm workers in 1970. As the leader of the National Farmworkers Association, she continued her work of supporting and empowering farmers by providing English classes, voter registration drives, health clinics and a credit union for the association’s members. 
Margaret Hamilton (1936 – Present)
Hamilton was a computer scientist who was one of the first computer programmers to coin the term, “software engineer.” As a software engineer, she helped write the code for the lunar and command modules that were used on the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Hamilton’s focus on software that could detect system errors and recover information in a computer crash was essential in the Apollo 11 mission that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon. Her work the at Massachusetts Institute of Technology extended to programming software that could predict the weather and writing software that went on to identify enemy aircrafts for the first United States air defense system.

All of these women embodied grit, excellence, drive and brilliance that allowed them to have a profound impact on human culture, health, labor rights and technological systems. They have left us with lessons that we can forever hold onto. 
The Trưng sisters teach us the importance of fighting for what we love and standing by it despite the obstacles that come our way; Wright teaches us that our excellence will shine through regardless of others’ negative biases against us; Huerta teaches us the importance and weight that our voices carry when we see injustice occurring; and Hamilton teaches us that there are no limits to our work and craft. 
We should continue to educate ourselves beyond Women’s History Month about underrepresented women in history and the way they continue to influence our lives to this day.
Knowledge is power, so grow deeper in it. Rather than reading about the first few men that come up during research about a historical event or invention, let’s look deeper to try and find the women who have also contributed in a meaningful way.

No. 19 women’s lacrosse will take on the UC Berkeley Golden Bears and Stanford Cardinal in pursuit of their first intraconference road wins this weekend. The Trojans boast 8-2 overall and 6-0 home records, with losses only to No. 7 Boston College and No. 17 Princeton.
Head Coach Lindsey Munday spoke on the impact of beginning Pac-12 games at McAlister Field and her expectation for the team to exhibit a consistent style of play, regardless of location. 
“It’s always fun to play at home, to have the fans cheering you on is awesome. It just gives confidence to come out, to compete well, to get the wins,” Munday said. “Nothing changes on the road, we want to walk in focused on us, first and foremost, rather than our opponent.”
With just two losses heading into the final stretch of the season, the Trojans’ future looks promising. Seven different players have notched a hat trick on the season, six of which were in the last three games. Redshirt sophomore attacker Isabelle Vitale leads the Pac-12 in assists per game. USC’s offensive balance sets them apart; the team largely attributes this on-field cohesion to their camaraderie off the field.
“We have one of the strongest cultures, not just at USC, but in the whole NCAA regardless of sport,” graduate midfielder Katie Ramsay said. “Our team genuinely loves and cares about each other … We’re with each other constantly. Eat, sleep, study, everything we do together.”
Sunday’s matchup against 4-5 Stanford is met with heavy anticipation as the Trojans will go up against the Cardinal’s nationally-ranked offense. The Cardinal offense features sophomore midfielder Annabel Frist and redshirt sophomore attacker Ashley Humphrey, the Pac-12 second place  in goals and leader assists. In points per game, Stanford is No. 13 in the NCAA and No. 1 in the Pac-12. 
Ramsay also said that the team’s style of play is worthy of any offense or defense. 
“For us, it’s always about us. Never focusing or putting too much stock in what they’re doing, but really believing in our systems and what has worked for us,” Ramsay said. “Our defense is one of the top in the country … If we just focus on us and what we’re doing it doesn’t matter who we’re playing.” 
Across the NCAA, senior defender Olivia Dooley ranks No. 10 and USC as a team ranks No. 8 in caused turnovers per game. With sophomore defender Alexis Niblock, who already won Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week this year, and versatile midfielders like Ramsay, the Trojans have the tools to be disruptors.
Before the Stanford game, USC will face 3-6 Cal. This season, nine freshmen have made their Cal debut. The inexperience of Cal’s roster has led to defensive struggles, with opponents averaging about 12 goals per game. One player to watch is senior midfielder Maya Lawliss, who is the first women’s lacrosse  player ever to be named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.
Despite five NCAA tournament appearances, USC has failed to make it beyond the quarterfinals. The Trojans have expressed confidence in their ability to improve their performances each week in preparation for a long-awaited deep playoff run. 
“We don’t want to be the same team we were in February or March. We want to continue to improve and play our best at the end of the season,” Munday said. “Whether it’s after a loss or a win, looking in the mirror and doing everything [that] we can, both individually and collectively, to continue to get better while still having fun and keeping the energy up. I think that’s a really great balance in this group.”
USC will take on UC Berkeley Friday at 3 p.m., and then will head to Laird Q. Cagan Stadium and face the Cardinal Sunday at 1 p.m. Both games can be streamed on pac-12.com.

No. 3 USC beach volleyball returns to the courts this coming weekend, heading south to participate in the East Meets West Invitational tournament in Manhattan Beach.
The Trojans last saw action March 18 during the Surf & Turf Invitational in Miami Beach. The Trojans went 3-1 that weekend, picking up wins over No. 15 Florida Atlantic, No. 14 Florida International and North Florida while suffering their first loss of the season in a 1-4 loss to No. 1 TCU. Freshman Gabby Walker and junior Delaynie Maple scored the Trojans’ lone point during the loss on court three.
“They played a really great game, so I’m proud of the way that we all fought,” Maple said about the loss. “People were able to take things that they might not have known that they need to work on, and we’ve made a ton of improvement this past week on that. So …we’ve only really taken it as a  positive.”
The Trojans’ work in practice came during a rare break in their schedule that granted them a weekend without competition, a break they are committed to taking advantage of. Moving forward, the Trojans will compete every weekend through the rest of the season. 
“It was nice to have a week off because you kind of regroup a little bit, take care of the body and mentally shut it down for a little bit and recharge,” said Head Coach Dain Blanton. “We only have about a month until Pac-12 championships, so we’re in a really good spot and we’re trying to get the most improvement as we can every day.”
On top of an extra week of rest, the Trojans will benefit from the return of junior Megan Kraft, the other half of the star court one pairing that, along with Maple, has yet to drop a point this season.
Now, the Trojans are geared up and eager to return to the sand and play their aggressive style of volleyball as they prepare to face top teams this weekend. The Trojans will take on No. 5 LSU, No. 4 Florida State and No. 11 Georgia State for the first time, as well as a rematch with No. 16 Florida International.
“​​Every match is a battle, and we’ve got to play well. We’ve got to work as a team and we’ve got to make sure that everyone’s focused on their job so that they take care of their court,” Blanton said. “We’ve got to come to play every time. You respect your opponent and you do that by throwing your best punch every time.”
This tournament poses a unique challenge to the Trojans as they prepare to take on some East Coast schools they don’t often get to play.
“A lot of the East Coast schools, or just not-California schools, do play a different type of volleyball,” Maple said. “Just trying not to get too caught up in that, and just remembering what we do and what we do best and just playing as a team [is key], but I’m really excited to see the way that we all compete after having two weeks of just being able to train.”
As the season moves forward, USC is keenly aware that every day is an important step that brings them closer to their goal of a repeat Pac-12 title and a three-peat NCAA championship title. In the history of NCAA beach volleyball, one school has never won three straight championships.
“[We are] just focusing on each day and not getting too caught up on May 8, knowing that we’ll get there when we get there,” Maple said. “​​We have a lot of improvements to make, which I think we have been making, and I’m really proud of everybody on the team. Everybody’s been going all in so it’s been awesome.”
The Trojans’ first match will kick off at 9:30 a.m. Friday against LSU at Manhattan Beach Pier.

Uncertainty, ironically, is what steers the course of our lives from the very beginning. It is human nature to question everything, to try to peer around every blind curve at each fork in the road and to find the “why” in everything that we do. In most cases, that “why” presents itself after all the real work has been done, and there’s no going back. 
For graduate lacrosse midfielder Katie Ramsay, her “why” is finally coming into view after half a decade of playing a collegiate sport she never intended on falling in love with. 
Ramsay committed to USC after attending a lacrosse camp early in high school and quickly became enraptured by the program. However, lacrosse was not always her end-all-be-all sport growing up. 
“I am from the East Coast, which is obviously a lacrosse hotspot, so I think I started lacrosse when I was in second or third grade,” Ramsay said. “[I] never really loved it. I always wanted to go to college for soccer.” 
The transition from soccer to lacrosse was a first glimpse at uncertainty around collegiate athletics for Ramsay. TheLos Angeles sun was just one reason that Ramsay took the path that she did in the aforementioned fork in the road, which led her to play at USC. 
“I just fell in love with the environment of the people out here, and for the first time really felt myself having fun playing lacrosse,” Ramsay said. “Through high school, I just looked forward to coming here and playing and it’s really lived up to all of it … I couldn’t ask for anything more.” 
For many student athletes, their years of playing in college are what wrap up their time in the spotlight. For Ramsay, however, playing lacrosse at USC is just the beginning of her love for the sport. 
“I never really thought it would become such a big part of my identity and who I am today,” Ramsay said. “I don’t think I would be who I am without the girls I surround myself with [and] the coaches that have taught me everything I know.” 
In any team sport, the squad as a whole, as one unit, is what makes seasons successful. We see this attitude that there is no “I” in “team” in women’s sports, in particular. The success of individual women on the field is only further expounded upon when surrounded by similarly fierce teammates. This energy is just one of the many reasons why women’s athletics are so fun to watch. The team dynamic is easy to support — not just one star player carrying the team on their back. 
Lacrosse is an especially good example of this aspect of teamwork, as the sport is still in its growing stages on the West Coast. Players across cities and states on this side of the country play on one, huge team working toward the spread of the sport, whether they realize it or not. 
“I think a lot of what makes this team special is everyone committed here wanting to grow the game,” Ramsay said. “It’s a special group of girls that has that passion for growing the game, and it’s been cool to see local high schools, local middle school girls come to our games and get so excited.” 
If you’re lucky enough to say that sports found you at a young age — whether through grueling nights in the bleachers watching an older sibling or a fly ball that almost hit your three-month-old head at a Giants game back in ’03 — you understand the importance of having role models 
in athletics as a child. For local kids, especially young girls with fewer people pushing them to play, collegiate athletes can be the perfect gateway drug into the addiction that is sports. 
This is just one of the many “whys” that Ramsay has found through lacrosse at USC. Her journey across the country enabled her to lead the charge in lacrosse’s own migration west. This power, however, also puts a lot of pressure on Ramsay; as her final games close out, so does her ability to make an impact at the collegiate level. 
“My main pressure that I’m feeling — this year especially — is the fear that this is my last year,” Ramsay said. “I think being a woman playing college sports is kind of like that last level. There is professional women’s lacrosse … but it’s not really a huge thing.” 
Women’s sports in college present unique challenges for playing after graduation. Professional leagues are few and far between for sports like lacrosse, and for players like Ramsay, the final moments of a nearly lifelong career are bittersweet. 
“It’s definitely that last opportunity to prove to myself what I can do and what I can be,” Ramsay said. “I’ve been trying to not let that get to me, but just use it to fuel me and get me pumped up for every single game because it could be the last opportunity.” 
With the end of one journey comes the beginning of many others. Ramsay’s commitment to the game thousands of miles away from its epicenter will only act as an aid in its westward dispersion. For the next generation of young women, representation at the highest level is the most impactful marketing method for the sport. 
“It’s just important for young girls to see themselves in media and on TV and be able to imagine themselves in these positions for when they grow up,” Ramsay said.
Ramsay’s advice for young lacrosse players emerged after a period of intense pressure that led to some unsatisfactory seasons for the midfielder. Her second, third and fourth seasons of college lacrosse showed that increased pressure doesn’t always warrant prime results. 
“I put so much pressure on myself to compete at that level again, and it just kind of made me play worse,” Ramsay said. “This year I’ve really been focusing on just having fun, playing loose and just enjoying the sport.” 
Ramsay’s renewed focus goes back to why humans get excited about sports so easily:  the competition, the energy, the uncertainty of every moment and, of course, the love of the game. 
“Lead with kindness, lead with love,” Ramsay said. “That’s my motto.”
