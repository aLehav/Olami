The USC men’s volleyball team lost its seventh match in a row this Thursday, falling to Concordia University in Irvine, Calif.. The  final set scores for the game were 23-25, 22-25, and 22-25. 
CUI came out strong offensively against USC, setting the tone early with their first five points being kills. For the final two sets, the Trojans managed to keep themselves neck-and-neck with the eagles, but it was late-set attack errors that ultimately allowed their opponent to run ahead on the scoreboard.
CUI’s final hitting percentage was 33.3% while USC’s was 27.8%. The Trojans finished with 17 attacking errors, compared to CUI’s 11.
USC ended the game with 33 digs against CUI’s 28, and 44 kills against CUI’s 41. Senior outside hitter Brandon Browning had the most kills from USC with 16, followed by junior outside and opposite hitter Billy Fauntleroy with 12. 
Senior libero Cole Paxson, who had eight digs and five assists in the game, explained how the Trojans’ passing and the pressure positively impacted the game. USC’s three man block formation was one of the strategies that helped the team gain points throughout each set. 
“It allowed us to be more free and read the game a little better,” Paxson said. “Obviously, we can improve and get the next win and just be able to crunch those closing points in the 20s … we missed a good amount of serves that allowed them to be off the hook, especially late in [the] game. We’ve got to be able to keep the pressure on through [the] entire game.” 
After their loss to CUI on Mar. 6, Paxson and company felt more confident coming into this game because they were familiar with how the Eagles play. Their starters were familiar and he felt trust for himself and his teammates’ abilities entering this game. 
Head coach Jeff Nygaard explained how the Trojans can become more familiar playing with each other, and continue to improve despite only having one win under their belt this season. 
“Once we achieve our chemistry and physicality and all those different pieces that go into having a high functioning team, we feel that the talents that we have, the abilities that we have, can put us in positions to have success,” Nygaard said. 
Paxson emphasized the need to move on from the loss and look ahead to the Trojans’ next game against the Eagles. 
“Our whole mindset right now is just be able to flip to the next game to play them again Saturday, and that’s the only game we can be worrying about at this point,” Paxson said. “What’s in the past is in the past and [we’ve] got to be able to perform this next game, Saturday.”
USC will close out their series against the Eagles Saturday, Mar. 13 at Galen Center; first serve is at 5 p.m.

USC Student Health’s investigations revealed the coronavirus variant first detected in New York present in the USC community in addition to the four cases of the variant first detected in the United Kingdom, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. Eight individuals have tested positive for the variant detected in New York, marking the first time USC has seen the New York variant.
According to New York City’s Advisor for Public Health Dr. Jay Varma, the variant first detected in the U.K. has a higher fatality rate than the founder strain. The New York variant, which was discovered in late November according to the New York Times, is more infectious than both the founder strain and variant in the U.K.
“People who are infected with [the variant detected in New York] have a higher likelihood of having severe disease,” Van Orman said. “We’re very concerned about it. It’s one of the reasons we’re not having a formal spring break.”
Student Health is sending positive cases to the public health lab to determine additional variants. 
Los Angeles County Public Health still currently advises against public celebrations and traveling. Van Orman said she is concerned about the amount of students traveling for Spring holidays because long-range trips are the reason behind the new variants.
“Whenever you travel, we’re taking the virus from one part of the country and moving to another part of the country,” Van Orman said.  “Most people traveling are not to sit by themselves somewhere, they’re traveling to do something … Their likelihood of infection is higher, and then they’re bringing both higher risk of infection as well as potentially new viral strains into the community.”
According to the USC COVID-19 Dashboard, 25 students and two employees tested positive for the coronavirus from Feb 28 to March 6, with detected rates at 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. 
USC Student Health opened a new on-campus vaccine site at the Lyon Center Tuesday and distributed more than 10,000 vaccines, including second doses and 6,000 complete vaccinations by the end of the week. USC was given 950 Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccines this week by the state and distributed to those eligible Thursday morning. 
The type of vaccine administered — Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson — depends on state supply and will vary based on allocation, Van Orman said. Regardless of the type, Van Orman said the three vaccines are each effective in suppressing both infection and severity of disease.
“These vaccines are, what I would call stunningly effective in reducing severe disease and hospitalizations, so if there’s any doubt in anyone’s mind about how good these vaccines are, I want to remove that,” Van Orman said. “If large portions of the population become vaccinated, we really have the ability to turn the corner on this — if we do it before we get a lot of variants.”
New Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccinated individuals, such as allowing those vaccinated to gather with other vaccinated households without masks, are not relevant to students, Van Orman said.
“We are not in the situation where we’re going to be engaging with other people who are vaccinated yet,” Van Orman said. “[Our workplace and University] guidelines won’t be changing anytime soon … until we move into a place where we have a much higher percentage of vaccinations.”
Approved activities currently allowed on-campus are limited to those run by faculty, Executive Director of Environmental Health and Safety Deona Vialpando-Willes said during an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“Per the guidelines from the county, the approved activities [are] really for people who are having academic or faculty-led instruction or study,” Willes said. “There has to be a faculty member or staff in charge and supervising any of [these] activities.”
Currently, all faculty must complete the ‘canopy checklist’ to use the canopies for in-person activities, Willes said. The checklist requires event organizers to follow all current Los Angeles County public health guidelines, including social distancing, wearing a mask and ensuring hand sanitizing stations are available. 
The USC custodial staff clean the canopy areas three times a day. Students and faculty attending in-person activities will also meet with Environmental Health and Safety staff beforehand to discuss cleaning protocols,  Willes said. 
USC Student Health is working toward an on-campus return in the Fall, but Van Orman said she could not reveal the extent of future in-person activities.
Although Van Orman said she hopes for a return to normal capacity in Fall 2021 for residence halls and in-person instruction, USC will still require limitations on large gatherings and the occupant density of campus spaces. 
Trojan Check will likely be required continuing into the Fall semester, Van Orman said, but its requirements may change and incorporate vaccine status. Additionally, the influenza vaccine status feature may also phase out when campus influenza vaccines end in April and cases start to drop off. 
“We don’t know whether testing is going to be required in the fall or not,” Van Orman said. “It’s really going to depend on vaccine prevalence as well as community prevalence.”

The Keck School of Medicine added two new progressive degree programs — narrative medicine and public health data science. 
The school also has another new program — speech-language pathology. The creation of the program was inspired by the need for work in the field matched with a lack of previous educational opportunities. The speech-language pathology program, which is admitting their first class in Fall 2021, is a terminal degree that trains and helps students obtain the appropriate certification and licenses to practice in the field.  
“There’s a lot of patients out there that have speech impediments, swallowing disorders and other diseases or conditions that prevent them from properly speaking, or from properly chewing and swallowing food for example,” said Richard Watanabe, associate dean for Health and Population Science Programs. “There’s a need for technicians to be out there helping these people train to talk again and to be able to swallow. And so, the pathology program felt that there was a need that was unfulfilled.”
These PDP programs allow undergraduate students to get a jump start on their master’s degree by receiving both an undergraduate and master’s degree in five years. 
The public health data science program welcomed its first class last fall. Created by the Department of Preventive Medicine, the program seeks to train students in the quantitative, statistical and computational skills necessary to manage and analyze large-scale “big data” in public health.
“It was felt that it was a niche that was unfilled at the moment,” Watanabe said. “You know big data or data science is a big area now, and the health sciences field didn’t really have a training program in it. We felt like creating a master’s [program] and having training students to work in that field was important.” 
The narrative medicine program, one of the newer programs, seeks to train those in the clinical field or those involved in health, social justice and community on how to record and retell stories related to clinical encounters. Founded two years ago, it’s the only program of the three to have current graduates. It involves physician-patient interaction, patient medical conditions and the translation of technical medical terms to a wider audience.
“ [The narrative medicine program] actually has a much broader student body because it not only includes people that are interested in medicine, like you know physicians or nurses or whatever, but it also includes … people who want to be journalists, or filmmakers, or even storytellers,” Watanabe said.
Meredith Franklin, associate professor of Clinical Preventive Medicine, helped in the planning process for the new public health data science progressive degree program.
“It was really to address the needs of our students to have a master’s program in a field where there’s a high demand for data science. A lot of students were looking for a program that combines biostatistics with computer science, and so that’s why we developed a program,” Franklin said. “It’s supposed to meet a need for a surface area where there’s a lot of jobs right now and a lot of interest from students to be trained in that area because the job market is so hot.” 
According to Franklin, the first class for the public health data science PDP has been doing well in their classes, taking courses like  “Introduction to Health Data Science,” a new class created for the program. Students also learn modeling, machine learning and statistical computing.
“So [the program] is nice in that regard, where we get to really train students in a very specific area, but it’s also nice that the students are very motivated,”  Franklin said. “You know there’s a clear end goal in mind with the program.” 
Prior to these additions, Keck already offered 11 progressive degrees, including programs in applied biostatistics and epidemiology, global medicine and public health. However, the need for more workers in specific fields sparked the creation of the new programs. 
“When these programs were created, the faculty that created them had sort of a target audience in mind,” Watanabe said. “These programs were created with specific sorts of deficiencies in the job market in mind.” 
Students enrolled in the progressive degree program face an additional challenge of balancing both their undergraduate and graduate-level courses, Watanabe said. 
“The biggest challenge is making sure these students can keep up, and so, I can’t speak for other programs, but at least within preventive medicine, we keep a close eye on these students and make sure they’re doing well in their classes,” Watanabe said. “If they seem like they’re struggling, we try to provide them with some help, because it is a challenge to be doing both at the same time.”
However, when a student can take on this accelerated degree, they are provided with many bonuses as well, such as graduate student resources and significant time saved in pursuing their master’s degree. Students come with a range of interests and reasons that help them get a better understanding for the medical field, Watanabe said.
“A lot of students, they’re all pre-med and so they think that [the progressive degree program] will help them get into medical school,” Watanabe said. “But once they start doing the program, some of them actually realize that, you know, this is something they’ve never been exposed to and they learn something new, and then they may change their mind and decide that they want to do something in public health, for example.” 
Isabella Hauptman, USC’s Class of 2020 valedictorian, is enrolled in the applied biostatistics and epidemiology progressive degree program. She finished the curriculum for her master’s degree a semester after she graduated with her bachelor’s degree in cognitive science and is currently spending the spring semester on her thesis.  
“It’s an incredibly supportive environment, and people are excited to see somebody who’s young and excited about what they’re studying,” Hauptman said. “Everything has been just a really good experience for me getting to know the professors and working with my advisors.”
Hauptman said she had always been interested in epidemiology and that the progressive degree program influenced her decision to go to USC. She was interested in being able to pursue a master’s in applied biostatistics and epidemiology through the program so she could save time and access additional resources to begin her career early. 
“That was really appealing for me, to be able to get this master’s in an accelerated time because then, I enter the workforce a little bit sooner and get my hands dirty before I eventually do apply to a PhD program,” Hauptman said. “The master’s program here is very good and I feel very trained, and so I’m excited to go ahead and be able to start a little bit sooner than most.”
Some students enrolled in the progressive degree program complete it before attending medical school, while others use it as a way to learn more about a field, to take a step towards acquiring a PhD or to jump into the professional world sooner.
Connor Fausto, part of the class of 2020 with a degree in business administration, is also pursuing a master’s degree in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, and plans to attend medical school.
“The stem cell biology program seemed like something that I was interested in because I was trying to decide on if I should pursue research or pursue medicine. That’s why I chose this because it kind of gave insight onto what was happening, specifically in the field of regenerative medicine,” Fausto said. “Now that I’m in the course and I’m taking a lot of the classes, I think it’s cool that I actually see myself being able to do both.”
For Hauptman, she said she feels that USC did a great job preparing her and supporting her throughout the process of the accelerated master’s program. 
“I felt so much support from USC, to be able to go and pursue my dream and so and that’s all I can really ask … to be able to talk to people and pick their brains and get their advice has been so valuable, not to mention you know all the foundational skills that I’ve been developing and learning,” Hauptman said.

As the countdown to the Grammys continues, the Recording Academy has been hosting multiple events promoting diversity and inclusion in the music industry. One of which, held Wednesday evening, was the Inaugural Black Music Collective Event, celebrating Black voices in music and creative industries. Music industry veterans, activists and actors alike came together to discuss the impact that Black creators have on these industries and their strides to create a more inclusive environment within them. 
Kicking off the night, singer-songwriter H.E.R. carried out a powerful performance of her song “I Can’t Breathe.” As the screen flashed with images of the Black Lives Matter protests, H.E.R.’s voice sang of the inequalities faced by Black Americans on a daily basis. 
At the conclusion of the song, the screen read: “Do not say ‘you do not see color.’ When you see us, see us.” As the night continued, this quote would serve as the perfect summation of the Black Music Collective’s mission to give Black creators the recognition they deserve and to ensure that they are equally represented and heard. 
Following the performance, Harvey Mason Jr. — the Recording Academy’s first Black president — along with Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer Valeisha Butterfield Jones described the significance of the night as the first time the Grammys held an event celebrating the numerous contributions Black music professionals have made to the industry.
“This is a historic moment in the Academy’s 63-year history, one that represents a new chapter and a new path for equity and inclusion here at the Academy and in the music industry at large,” Mason said. 
The event is only the beginning of the diversity efforts that the Academy hopes to build upon in the future. 
“That in part is the reason for the creation of the Black Music Collective, a group of prominent Black music creators and professionals who share the common goal of amplifying voices, Black voices and the music community,” Jones said.
With the event set in motion, the BMC’s executive sponsor and emcee for the night, Jeriel Johnson, introduced the first fireside chat between singer-songwriter John Legend and activist Tamika Mallory. Their free-flowing conversation explored the impact that culture has on music and vice versa. From the Civil Rights Movement to the Black Lives Matter Movement, music has been shaped by both political and social culture. While artists are inspired to create because of these movements, activists can also use songs as anthems for their cause. 
“Harry Belafonte, who is a leader to me and a mentor … always talks about Paul Robeson’s statement that ‘artists are the gatekeepers of truth,’” Mallory said, “so we always say that when the movements are hot, the music is hot. The music is going to reflect the times.” 
Providing a creator’s perspective on the solidarity between the artists and their listeners, Legend said, “I will say personally that it brings me joy every time I see someone marching to the song that Common and I created, ‘Glory.’ It was inspired by Dr. King, it was inspired by Ava DuVurney’s film ‘Selma,’ but we also always wanted to connect the song to what was happening in that moment.”
Contemporary Gospel singers, PJ Morton and Yolanda Adams’ performance was an opening act to the next fireside chat between actress, writer and producer Issa Rae and singer-songwriter Janelle Monáe. The chat was moderated by Valeisha Butterfield Jones.
As Black women in the music and film industries, they each provided a glimpse into the obstacles they have faced throughout their careers because of their intersectional identities. Their paths into their respective places were non-linear. Tired of being turned down by traditional record companies, Monáe decided to become an independent artist by starting Wondaland Records. 
“It’s not about being famous, it’s not about selling records,” Monáe said. “It’s about community, it’s about purpose, it’s about us rewriting the narrative of what Black music can sound like … how do we redefine that because I don’t want another artist to have to deal with questioning their value because of tradition.” 
Rae called Monáe her “musical muse,” admitting that she would write while listening to Monáe’s music. Rae shared how women like Monáe inspire her creative process and career journey. 
“I am someone that takes in the energy of other people around me … I fuel off of that,” Rae said. “There is just something so inspiring about seeing people walk in their own purpose that makes you think that you can do the same.”
When talking about her label, Monáe emphasized the value in the work that many creators like her and Rae are doing: “There is a different blueprint that we wanted to focus on and redefining what we wanted to do as creatives who love our Blackness. We can be so many things, we have big ideas that can spar with the George Lucases and the Steven Spielbergs. … We are everywhere. We shape and create culture. “
Aside from the wonderful discussions and performances, “Mogul Moments” were spread throughout the night. Legendary music industry icons including Quincy Jones, Debra Lee, Jeff Harleston and Jimmy Jam shared their insight on the evolving industry and gave advice to those who want to make their mark in the music world.
At the beginning of the night, Jeriel Johnson said, “People have asked what is Black music, but what isn’t Black music?” The BMC Event served as a reminder that the music industry would not be where it was today if it weren’t for Black creators and innovators.
It might have been Quincy Jones who put it best when he said, “Black music is always gonna have a very special strong, powerful place in culture.”

USC baseball will host Nevada this weekend for a three-game weekend series at Dedeaux Field. 
The Trojans enter the series with a 3-6 record, coming off three consecutive losses to Cal State Fullerton, Pepperdine and UCLA at the Southern California College Baseball Classic last weekend. Dating back to their series against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the Trojans have won just one of their last six games. 
Despite the rough start, head coach Jason Gill is still confident in the team’s ability to bounce back. 
“We have enough talent out here to start winning baseball games; we just haven’t put it together yet,” Gill said. “Bad news is, it’s a bad start. Good news is that it’s early in the year, and we have time to turn it around.” 
Gill said USC is still getting settled after an extended offseason due to the coronavirus. 
“We’re going through some growing pains,” Gill said. “We didn’t have a fall, so we’re still trying to figure some things out, and I feel like we have had a good week of practice so far, so I’m confident we will turn it around here shortly and start playing better baseball.” 
USC was initially set to face Pepperdine again Tuesday, but the game was canceled due to Pepperdine’s coronavirus-related safety policies. 
After Gill and company dropped the series to San Luis Obispo two weeks ago, Gill said he felt the defense was the main issue with the team. The defense continued to struggle last weekend, allowing a combined 26 runs in three games, just under nine runs per game. 
“We, obviously, need to clean up our defense,” Gill said. “We’re still making way too many errors, and they’re controllable things; it’s things that we can get better at in terms of catch play.”
The defense is not the only issue for the Trojans, as the offense managed to put up just six runs in their three-game skid.
“Offensively, we gotta get that going as well,” Gill said. “That’s supposed to be our strength — it’s supposed to be our offense, so we haven’t been very good there as well, so we got a lot of work to do in a lot of areas.”
Nevada is a non-conference game, which will give the Trojans a chance to improve before Pac-12 play opens against Washington next weekend. 
Nevada defeated San Luis Obispo in a 3-1 series win in their season opener, and come into the series with a 4-4 record. The Wolf Pack’s most recent game was March 2, a 13-4 loss to Arizona State. Nevada will be returning to action against USC following a 10-day break following the postponement of its weekend series with San Jose State last weekend.
“It [would] be nice to get some momentum going into conference play next week against Washington,” Gill said. “Obviously, when you win, you feel better about yourself and you feel better about the work you put in and it keeps you going in the right direction, so any type of momentum we could get going into next week would be awesome.” 
This weekend gives the Trojans a chance to gain the momentum they have been looking for early in the season. First pitch between USC and Nevada is Friday at 5 p.m.

Almost every artist starts small.
And nearly every major name you see in the music world today had a unique path to stardom.
Pop culture icon Lady Gaga performed in dive bars in lower Manhattan after dropping out of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey’s “Hero” at a talent contest and was signed to Def Jam Recordings the following year, Post Malone got his start on SoundCloud and Justin Bieber found fame through a video posted to YouTube by his mother.
Now more than ever, it’s important to uplift the work of up-and-coming musical talent. Your favorite independent artist could end up being the next Beyoncé — consider that. So why not show them your support and when they take off, they’ll know you were around before the fame. 
In high school, all I would ever listen to was indie rock. I wasn’t super invested or interested in any major pop singers at the time. But it wasn’t until later that I realized the value in supporting independent artists who are still trying to get their names out there in more ways than just listening.
It’s been a year now since the pandemic has shut down live concerts, festivals and touring — hitting the music industry hard. Though the increased use of social media platforms to gain recognition allows for a different type of social interaction and support network for artists, they are missing their financial backbone. 
Unsigned, independent artists who rely on streaming services for income and making their voices heard by many are facing challenges. It’s not uncommon knowledge that music streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music do not pay their artists a livable income. Though the pay per stream rate differs between these services, generally speaking, it comes out to a fraction of a penny. 
When you add up the costs of studio recording, production, mixing, album cover art and distribution, this profit is incredibly low. Unless an artist has a significant social media presence, a consistent number of streams and listeners or is signed under a record label that pays them in advance, it can be hard for them to gain deserved recognition. 
Let’s discuss a recent outlier in the music streaming world — SoundCloud. SoundCloud was once the only streaming service I listened to music from — mainly because I was (and still am) someone who could spend hours making playlists and it was the only platform I felt I could easily discover unique sounds without being influenced in any direction. So, naturally, as I was scrolling through Twitter the other day, I was pleasantly surprised by SoundCloud’s new announcement. 
Revolutionizing the way music platforms pay independent artists on their site, SoundCloud has just introduced a new model of payouts driven directly by artists’ fanbases. The implementation of “fan-powered royalties” allows “each listener’s subscription or advertising revenue” to be “distributed among the artists that they listen to.” This contrasts the “pro rata” system other streaming services most often use. 
The “pro rata” model favors the rights holders of the most listened to tracks. So by SoundCloud turning the tables, in turn, rising indie artists and their fans will benefit. 
USC alumnus and half of the indie pop duo One11Twenty, Kyle DelFatti, talks about the algorithm’s influence on getting small artists noticed. 
“At the end of the day, the algorithm is just this thing that’s trying to be somewhat of a meritocracy where it’s reporting some aspect of quality about the songs,” DelFatti said.
Even through small interactions, you can help activate the algorithm and help lesser-known artists get noticed. 
“Platforms will see positive attention, and they will show us to more people,” DelFatti said. 
Supporting unsigned artists goes a long way: whether it’s following them on Spotify, liking their songs, albums, EPs, adding them to your favorite playlists or sharing their new releases on social media.
“Writing something and sharing somebody’s page, sharing their Spotify page or sharing their personal website, doing the action itself speaks volumes,” USC alumnus and songwriter Jack Henry Day said. “Not only for the artists themselves but to anybody that comes in contact with you and trusts your opinion or is interested in what you’re interested in.”
Many concert livestreams these days are a fraction of the cost it would be to get a seat in person. Now is an opportunity to take advantage and uplift the artists in your area, who you know will appreciate it. 
This weekend, students of USC’s Music Industry program have put together a livestreamed music festival they are calling Bummerfest. Hosting six incredibly talented rising musical artists — Guspy, Amir Kelly, Lizzy Cameron, Ella Collier, Tippy Balady and Walkabout — the concert is taking place Saturday, March 13. 
Taking the time to support artists in your area and the Trojan network has an impact. The artists you follow today could be the stars of tomorrow.

When I sat down to write this column, I heard the theme song of “Sex and the City” playing in my head — I’m Carrie Bradshaw, channeling my inner 2000s baddie, pretending I’m gossiping with my besties Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte about our wild Friday night escapades in the Big Apple.
But this is 2021. We’re in a worldwide pandemic. I’m not Carrie Bradshaw, and I’m not sitting at a boutique cafe sipping lattes with my gal pals. Instead I’m sitting at home in sweat shorts with tubes hanging out of my chest, filling my pill organizers, flipping in and out of Zoom classes and virtual doctor’s appointments, and every hour I lie down in a box to give my head and neck a break. Real sexy stuff. 
To give you some context, I’m a transfer student, and this is my first semester at USC. I’m also a junior who is restarting my junior year, for a second time. Everything about my identity as a student is never what I envisioned it to be — kind of like how Carrie never envisioned herself single and writing a sex advice column into her late 30s — but here we both are. On the outside, I feel like Carrie, a smart, curly-haired, fierce queen in a brown slinky Dolce & Gabbana slip dress. Yet what’s invisible to everyone around me is that on the inside, my body is attacking itself, literally. 
In 2018, I took a medical leave of absence from college because I got so sick I could barely walk. After months of bopping around to different providers and getting different opinions, I thought I’d get a nice, neat, clear and curable diagnosis, tied up in a little box with a bow. Instead what I got was a dumpster-fire of multiple diagnoses.
I’m 22, toned, tan, fit, ready and supposed to be having “the best four years of my life” right now, but instead you’re telling me I have multiple, incurable, chronic diseases that I’ll likely have for the rest of my life — some of which will almost certainly worsen as I age? 
In a matter of months my body completely changed; as a result of my conditions, I unintentionally lost 20 pounds, my hair started coming out in clumps, I had surgeries, lumbar punctures, scans, radio frequency ablations, countless infusions, tubes hanging out of my arm, belly, then chest, headaches so bad I couldn’t open my eyes, nausea so intense I couldn’t stand and pain so fierce moving my neck would put me in tears. 
For a long time I struggled to accept my new body — its triggers, quirks, tolerance for certain activities — and I say “new body” because that’s what it felt like, being reborn into a body that wasn’t the one I’d spent 20 years learning to understand, and then told to start over and figure it all out again. I joke it felt like a second puberty. And with that came a major lesson in patience and self love (both things I’m still actively working on). 
Yet inevitably, there were, and still are, many days where I felt ugly, unsexy, gross and unlovable because of my health conditions. On those days I live vicariously through Carrie and “Sex and the City,” remembering the most important lesson she gave me: fabulosity isn’t external, it’s internal. I realized early on that this wasn’t going to be a quick battle, so I resolved to be my version of fabulous or die trying.
Now I’m here —  a student at USC — having never set foot on campus, entering Zoom University and doing my best every day to channel my inner Carrie Bradshaw. I’m starting a new chapter in my life balancing both identities — patient and student — finding out how they can coexist. 
My hope for this column is to share my thoughts and stories to provide comfort, community and resources to readers with similar lived experiences or readers who are new to the world of chronic illness and differently abled people. I’ll give you a fly-on-the-wall look into what it’s actually like being a young person, student, friend, daughter, single gal — and more — battling chronic illness. I’ve found that the more I share my unique lived experience through story, not only do I find community with others battling similar challenges, but I also find connection with others outside the world of chronic illness, because the life lessons I’ve learned since becoming chronically ill are universal. Ultimately, this column will be from the perspective of my lived experience — chronically ill, chronically fabulous and chronically Catherine.
Writer’s note: Feel free to reach out to Chronically Catherine if you’re also a student of different abilities working to coexist with daily adversity, without losing sight of your fabulosity – chronicallycatherine@gmail.com or @itschronicallycatherine on Instagram.

Content warning: The following article mentions child abuse and molestation. 
Thirty years ago, the name Dylan Farrow was launched into the international spotlight after rumors arose that beloved director Woody Allen sexually abused her. Dylan was seven years old at the time, and the daughter of actress Mia Farrow, Allen’s longtime girlfriend. 
What followed was a media frenzy of unpredictable proportions, a large-scale police investigation and a bitter custody battle between Allen and Farrow. Farrow accused Allen of sexually assaulting her daughter and, to refute this accusation, Allen accused Farrow of parental manipulation. He claimed Farrow created false allegations and coached Dylan to get back at him for having an affair with her other daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.
Despite the serious claims, Allen recovered from the allegations and rebounded in the public eye almost instantly. He continued to make Oscar Award-winning films and maintained a stable presence at award shows and on talk shows. 
When the #MeToo movement first broke the internet, Allen’s name and Dylan’s story began to circulate once again. However, for many years, her story never received the attention it deserved. “Allen v. Farrow,” a new HBO docuseries that premiered on Feb. 21, details Allen’s horrific actions and aims to give Mia, Dylan and the rest of the Farrow family the attention they deserve.  
“Allen v. Farrow” gives an adult Dylan a platform to speak about the abuse she endured over the last 30 years. The docuseries is an incredibly well-executed investigation into the lives of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow. It is a must-watch for anyone, regardless of whether you’ve seen “Annie Hall” or “Rosemary’s Baby.”
The series begins by dissecting Allen and Farrow’s strange relationship, along with Allen’s role as a father figure to the Farrow children. 
Interviews conducted with family members and friends paint Allen and Dylan’s father-daughter relationship as disgusting and emotionally abusive. Dylan often claimed that she would hide from Allen because she did not want to be around him, even before the sexual abuse allegations were made. 
Later, however, the story tragically intensifies when a traumatized 7-year-old Dylan Farrow tells her mother that Woody Allen had molested her. 
A heartbreaking conversation between the two was captured on video by Farrow. For the first time, this video has been released to the public.  
The video shows Dylan the day after Allen had visited saying that, “he [Allen] touched [my] privates.” The five minutes in which the recording is played is the most difficult part of the series to sit through. It features a devastated Dylan looking angry and heartbroken as she recounts to her mother the unforgivable act she alleges Allen committed. It’s gut-wrenching to listen to her voice break as she discusses how a man she viewed as her father violated her in ways no person, let alone a seven-year-old, should be violated. 
This video became infamous in the press after Allen accused Farrow of coaching Dylan in the short clip. However, the docuseries has child psychologists debunk these claims, and even without experts asserting the video’s authenticity, it is obvious Dylan was not coached. No child is that talented of an actress, and no one can fake that level of pain. 
The docuseries goes beyond the newspaper headlines and talk show interviews to unveil previously sealed court documents from child abuse experts, psychologists and therapists to aid in their investigation. It also scours through old home movies and interviews from family, friends and almost everyone remotely connected to the story. 
Copious amounts of evidence were analyzed by the “Allen v. Farrow” team and used to debunk popular myths supporting Allen’s innocence and claims of Farrow’s manipulation. The docuseries does an incredible job of dissecting the now-infamous report by the Yale-New Haven Hospital’s Child Sexual Abuse Clinic on Dylan. 
The report claimed there was no evidence of abuse toward Dylan and that she was inconsistent and changed her story. However, an investigation by “Allen v. Farrow” divulges information to undermine the report’s credibility, like how one of the lead team members at the clinic believed Dylan, a narrative that counters the report’s claims that she was unreliable. 
As well as proving the clinics report to be unreliable, “Allen v. Farrow” also makes it known that the Connecticut state police found probable cause to arrest Allen but chose not to because Frank Maco, the Connecticut state attorney, believed “Dylan was too fragile to face a celebrity trial.” 
“Allen v. Farrow” rebukes Woody Allen’s claims of innocence and builds a case against one of the most prolific Hollywood figures of the late twentieth century. 
The show’s investigation is compelling in its own right, but combining it with incredible filming and creative choices elevates the emotional impact of Dylan’s story. The use of happy home videos of the family’s seemingly idyllic life set to melancholic music evokes intense and extraordinary feelings of sorrow. And the seamless weaving between Mia Farrow’s home videos and recent interviews of the family craft a tale of misery, agony and betrayal. 
Although the docuseries has been well-received by many, it has faced its share of criticism. Many take issue with the fact that the producers did not interview Allen, Soon-Yi or any of his supporters. These critics, however, fail to take into account that, “Allen v. Farrow” did reach out to the aforementioned parties but did not receive a response. Although they did not get his direct testimony, they use Allen’s own words from his 2020 memoir, “Apropos of Nothing” to tell his side of the story.
Those who call for the inclusion of Allen’s testimony fail to recognize the purpose of the docuseries. In a series focused on elevating Dylan Farrow’s voice, a voice that has been pushed aside and criticized for years, it is not necessary to give her alleged abuser an equal spotlight. 
The docuseries is Dylan’s chance to let her voice be heard and set the record straight. And “Allen v. Farrow” allows Dylan to rewrite the story that has excluded her voice for too long and finally reclaim her narrative.
