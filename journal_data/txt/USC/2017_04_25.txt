Victoria was a freshman in Spring 2016 when, after returning to her dorm from a night out with friends, she found herself locked out of her room.
An acquaintance offered to keep her company in his room. Initially, they spent time getting to know each other — but the conversation became uncomfortable when he made a lewd remark about her volunteer work.
“He ended up doing some inappropriate things like throwing a condom at me and saying some pretty concerning things,” Victoria said. “He ended up taking off his pants and as soon as that happened, I knew things were going to go really [badly].”
Fortunately for Victoria, now a sophomore and asked that her real name be withheld for privacy reasons, somebody entered the room before the situation could escalate, and she left. Emotionally distraught and shocked, she reported the incident to her resident assistant. She received emails from Title IX officials at USC, but ignored them for months.

For three months, Victoria remained silent before opening up about her experiences with sexual misconduct to Title IX — a federal law that prohibits gender discrimination, which includes sexual harassment and assault — investigators. As a volunteer health educator for teens, Victoria knew about the issue of sexual misconduct, but didn’t fully grasp the gravity of its consequences until she experienced it firsthand.
While awaiting the outcome of her Title IX investigation, Victoria contemplated what would happen to her perpetrator. Would he receive a fair punishment? Would his punishment fulfill her desire for justice?
Not all survivors of sexual misconduct choose to prosecute their perpetrators to achieve justice.  Many survivors decline to speak out, fearing they will be discredited or blamed. And even with a multitude of resources and treatments available, recovery can be painful because survivors are required to reflect on their experiences, however painful or traumatic.
Problems with reporting
Sexual assault, as defined by the U.S. Department of Justice, can be any form of coercive or non-consensual sexual contact, which includes unwanted sexual acts including forced intercourse, forcible sodomy and attempted rape, Sexual misconduct is a non-legal term that encompasses a broad range of actions, including sexual assault, harassment, exploitation and intimidation.
Anne Munch, a Denver-based attorney specializing in sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking cases, said some survivors choose not to press charges because they feel intimidated by lengthy legal procedures.
“Sexual assault is the most underreported crime that we have,” Munch said. “Only about 20 percent of sexual assault victims report to some sort of authority [according to Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network statistics for female college students]. So clearly they’re experiencing concerns and barriers around coming forward after something terrible has happened.”
Victoria said she decided not to report the incident when it first happened because she didn’t feel it was significant enough. She also said she felt intimidated by the Title IX procedure, which would require her to recount her experience in detail. However, she eventually realized that she needed to address the reality of what had happened.
“I had every right to be concerned and to feel threatened and to think it was not OK that he did what he did,” Victoria said. “Also, I know what the Title IX process is like — that was the biggest part. I’ve watched documentaries; I’ve read about it; I’ve talked to people who have gone through it. I wasn’t in the place those previous months to do that.”
She confronted her feelings through therapy, and found that getting professional help allowed her to understand she didn’t have to be broken by her experience.
“I really didn’t want to be labeled as any sort of victim,” Victoria said. “I didn’t want to put myself in that emotionally vulnerable state.”
During the last week of April 2016, Title IX investigators began looking into her case. The investigation lasted until the first few weeks of summer. And as it unfolded, she was disappointed that investigators did not express deeper empathy for her.
“There were a lot of times where I felt like the Title IX investigator and coordinator were trying to scare me out of certain things, telling me, ‘He would get suspended and he could get expelled and you need to know that,’” Victoria said. “[They told me] during his [hearing] that he was crying the whole time — things that were kind of irrelevant.”
She doesn’t think the perpetrator of the misconduct received an appropriate punishment — which she anticipated, but still felt dismayed by.
“Because he didn’t actually get to rape me, there wasn’t much they could have done,” Victoria said. “He got one semester of mandatory counseling, which I really don’t think was enough.”
The Title IX office declined to comment on Victoria’s investigation.
Other forms of justice
For those like Victoria, seeking justice can be an elusive pursuit. While some believe in taking legal action, others may turn to alternative solutions to find closure.
According to Munch, victims of sexual assault and misconduct find ways to actualize their personal definition of justice.
“I’ve known lots of survivors [who] really feel like they want to be heard in court,” Munch said. “Even if they lose their cases, they still want the opportunity to tell [people] what happened to them and look the defender in the eye and do whatever they can to try to get the system to work for justice.”
However, some survivors do not believe legal justice is fundamental to a full recovery. Some simply choose to never take action.
“I’ve known others — many, many others — who simply can’t do that,” Munch said. “Some, quite frankly, never really admit what happened to themselves for years or decades or maybe never. So there’s a whole spectrum of how survivors seek to rebalance and recalibrate their lives after such a startling event.”
Tara, a junior at USC who declined to use her last name for privacy reasons, said she found greater stability after she was sexually assaulted by helping provide a safe space for survivors to share their stories and recover from trauma. As the president of Trojans Against Sexual Assault, Tara has worked with campus organizations to create programming for survivors, as well as campaigns on sexual assault prevention.
Tara, who said she was assaulted as a child by a family acquaintance during a trip to India, understood what it felt like to be helpless, afraid and isolated — not knowing who would believe her story, and not knowing when she could finally feel secure. This experience propelled Tara to communicate with sexual assault survivors. By supporting others through their struggles, she felt less alone and realized what happened wasn’t at all her fault, ultimately empowering her to move forward in life with a mission in mind: providing a voice for survivors like her.
But unlike many students who have the resources to report their assaults, Tara did not have the ability to hold her perpetrator accountable. Because she never revealed this secret to her parents until her sophomore year of high school, she now realizes he will never receive punishment for his crime. Now, she is cultivating her own form of justice: living without fear, cynicism and dejection.
“For me, justice came through my empowerment,” Tara said. “It came from understanding that [the experience] isn’t who I am. I’m not going to be defined by something a sick man did to me — I’m going to be defined by how powerful and strong and intelligent I am, and by how I’m going to help other people.”
Working in the community
After the incident in January, Victoria continued her advocacy with USC’s Sexual Assault Task Force, a committee that works with students to improve the University’s approach to sexual assault education. In addition to reviewing sexual misconduct policies in the SCampus student policy manual, she has worked closely with a fraternity president to develop a new sexual assault curriculum for the greek system. But despite her contributions, it wasn’t until she found the courage to reveal her story to other survivors that she discovered a sense of justice.
“Justice doesn’t even mean a Title IX case for me,” Victoria said. “Justice is having every story heard — unfiltered.”
Victoria now values the importance of each survivor exercising their own voice to combat misconceptions regarding sexual assault and misconduct. She encourages survivors to abandon feelings of shame and fear — and to feel comfortable with sharing their experiences.
Victoria and Tara both acknowledge that survivors possess their own definition of justice. And while there are many different outcomes to survivors’ approaches, those who choose not to pursue legal action can still recover and regain full control of their lives.
“Nobody has the right to silence [survivors], and they should never be silenced,” Victoria said.

When Valerie Lopez started looking into ways to tackle sexual assault at USC, she stumbled upon a question that would try to answer for months: Why doesn’t USC offer forensic exams for victims? In the class ITP-499: “Innovation: From Idea to Impact,” Lopez — a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture — and her group decided they’d try to bring rape kits to campus, an idea that led them to conduct legal research and interview staff members at USC and across the country.
Currently, victims of sexual assault who come to the Engemann Student Health Center are referred to the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, approximately 45 minutes away from campus. The RTC boasts of the country’s leading experts in trauma care, but the lack of on-campus forensic exams spurred Lopez and two other students to investigate the feasibility of bringing rape kits to USC. Though Lopez and University administrators share a goal, their views on treating victims differ in a major way. USC believes that the best option for rape treatment is at a full-service facility filled with specialized professionals, even if it is a long drive away. To Lopez, though, that distance could make all the difference.

Professional assistance
Engemann clinicians are trained to take vaginal and rectal swabs, but the health center staff feels that the RTC is better equipped to treat victims. The Los Angeles County Hospital has a rape treatment center as well, but Engemann has a close relationship with the RTC and values its educational options and support services.
“That is the best place for them,” said Mildred Wenger, interim co-medical director at Engemann. “If it was my mother, my child, my friend, I would want them to get the best care. We can give them the best care that we can, but we’re not full-service.”
Wenger stressed that the options its staff provides, in addition to its demeanor and tact, make the RTC a necessary resource. Another key reason Wenger would refer a patient to the RTC is Engemann’s inability to collect data, like hair samples or DNA. She explained that there is no chain of custody, or paper trail of physical evidence. Her staff cannot collect this data, but  Wenger explained that the RTC can — which ensures that if a patient decides to press charges or file a restraining order despite any initial reluctance, the option is still available.
“We don’t destroy the evidence ever,” said Gail Abarbanel, founder and director of the RTC.
The center provides free care for children and adults who seek help after a sexual assault. It’s open 24 hours a day, and since its inception in 1974, it has served more than 50,000 victims. Over the years, it’s seen advancements in DNA technology and improved access to the criminal justice system.
“The RTC has very comprehensive services, and victims have lots of choices and options, so they don’t have to go to many different agencies,” Abarbanel said. “The most important thing is to help them have access [to] 24-hour emergency care and forensics and counseling.”
According to Abarbanel, the center sees about three to four new victims a day —  some, but not all, of whom are college students. Other victims come every day for ongoing services. When a victims come in, the staff members give them options so they can make informed choices. The process includes medical care, even if victims aren’t aware of any physical injuries.
Though the RTC is not funded or managed by USC, the treatment center has a close relationship with Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services on campus. According to Wenger, the RTC seeks to fill in the gaps of what the Engemann staff cannot accomplish. Wenger and her team frequently meet with RSVP and have full clinical staff meetings to emphasize sensitivity training and patient comfort. But despite these efforts, Wenger would rather send a victim to Santa Monica, because there, she’s confident that they will take care of every aspect of a patient’s journey.
“I don’t like to do anything here if we can’t do it right,” Wenger said.
Struggling for support
Despite the quality of care at the RTC, students have expressed concerns about the accessibility of the center. Lopez feels that 45 minutes is too far, especially immediately after an assault.
“Honestly, from personal experience and the experience of others I’m very close to, the first few hours are critical in terms of who you tell, who you trust,” Lopez said. “If USC was my immediate resource, if I needed to be physically taken care of both medically and with a forensic exam, I probably would come back to RSVP to get therapy or file a Title IX case. I would feel more trusted at the school.”
A potential solution the group proposed is to train current Engemann employees to conduct forensic exams so students could have immediate help in a community they are already familiar with. They researched the cost and time commitment of training and verified the information by looking at schools with trained nurses, including Oregon State University and Indiana University. A sexual assault nurse at Indiana University told the group that the cost of training was between $400 and $500 per nurse, including 40 hours of training, and that the state typically pays for rape kits.
“I’m sure it’s more complicated than we know,” Lopez said, “but if other schools do it, and they’re much bigger schools like Indiana, I feel like we’re definitely capable.”
USC is far from the only elite university without on-site rape kits. In Lopez’s research, she found that only about four schools in the U.S. News top 100 and only about 10 out of all schools in the United States have forensic exams for sexual assault.
Determining feasibility
Lopez and her group have already met with multiple administrators and have plans to present to Provost Michael Quick on May 2. Lopez explained that they can’t market their proposal as a gain for the University, because although relatively cheap, implementation of the plan will cost money, and she believes with more accessible treatment, that reports of rape will go up — which might end up looking negative for the University.
“We’re having trouble finding a reason that would benefit [USC],” Lopez said. “That’s where we’re at now. There’s not much more we can do.”
This isn’t the first group of students trying to bring rape kits to campus, and it may not be the last. In 2014, students created an online petition to bring sexual assault nurse examiners to campus, which garnered nearly 700 signatures, and University officials responded by emphasizing the high quality of the RTC.
“I think the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center is wonderful,” Lopez said, “and it’s beautiful that we even have that resource. They have so many different [services] — I just think that it’s nothing our health center isn’t capable of.”

When Alexis, reported her sexual assault to Title IX investigators at Chapman University in December 2014, the last thing she expected was that officials would not believe her.
“I don’t recall really altering my story drastically, but apparently [they said] I did,” said Alexis,, now a junior majoring in communication at USC,who declined to use her real name for privacy reasons. “They didn’t record anything [during the investigation], they just hand wrote notes. [It] was the main reason I transferred [to USC] — I didn’t feel like I was in a school that would take care of me.”
Chapman University Lead Title IX Coordinator DeAnn Gaffney declined to comment on Alexis’ case.
For some survivors, there is a struggle to regain the narrative — and control — of their daily lives following an assault. However, even though Alexis felt disappointed by this outcome, she found a space that allowed her to tell her own story: social media.
In recent years, outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr have become spaces where survivors like Alexis can connect with many others who share similar experiences, and can serve as advocacy platforms where survivors ultimately have the power to dictate their own narratives. But online spaces are not free from negative social reactions to assault: Victim blaming, shaming and a lack of survivor privacy are probable consequences of sharing an assault case on social media.
Sharing stories
BuzzFeed recently became an example of social media’s ability to influence the sexual assault narrative. In June 2016, it published a piece that soon became one of the site’s most shared stories of the year: an open letter from a sexual assault survivor to her assailant, which created national headlines with a raw, powerful message that spread across social media.
The letter served as a viral spark that reignited online discourse surrounding sexual assault on college campuses and added personal context to the Stanford rape case, in which Stanford student Brock Turner was found guilty of three counts of felony sexual assault but only sentenced to six months in jail.
“Being able to broadcast [your assault] to everyone and turn it into something … and not be ashamed — I think that can definitely change the narrative,” Alexis said.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
According to a December 2016 New York Magazine editorial, the online outrage that followed revealed the power and potential of social media to portray the untold side of a story on behalf of sexual assault victims.
“Social media brings you the empowerment you otherwise wouldn’t have had if you didn’t speak up,” Alexis said. “It could empower you to own what has happened to you and take control, because … you lose control when you are sexually assaulted.”
According to therapist and clinical associate professor Kristen Zaleski, who works at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, social media can also be a valuable and unique place for survivors to find support because it provides a personalized platform to share stories.
“The truth is, one in four women has a history of surviving a sexually violent episode,” Zaleski said. “So whenever you post something, you have a 25 percent chance that the person reading that has the same story, and is going to empathize with you, and maybe even share back or be inspired.”
Aside from being a sexual assault survivor, Alexis is also an advocate on campus, where social media has become a key aspect of her work. Alexis is a representative for Violence Outreach Intervention and Community Empowerment, a program in which USC students educate their peers about gender-based trauma.
“When I do my VOICE presentations, I tell people to friend me on Facebook or follow me, and I get a handful of people who do add me — they don’t necessarily talk to me, but they know that I am there if they ever want to talk,” Alexis said. “I also share articles and sometimes write longer thought pieces of my own … on the state of sexual assault on campuses in the United States and around the world.”
Online issues 
Alexis’ social media advocacy began after her Title IX investigation, which was not ruled in her favor. Alexis’ alleged perpetrator was found not guilty, and her case was dismissed. She turned to Facebook as an outlet to explain what had happened to her — it is where Alexis’ story is told, undiluted by forces outside. According to Women Against Violence Against Women, a Canadian rape crisis center, rape culture fosters prevailing social attitudes that normalize or trivialize sexual assault and abuse. And while social media can undoubtedly empower survivors of sexual assault, Zaleski said it can also be a toxic space that perpetuates this problem.
In a study she conducted in 2016 that examined the presence of rape culture within the comments section of online news articles, Zaleski found that victim blaming was the most prominent theme.
Zaleski defines victim blaming as a common filter through which many people approach sexual assault. Instead of antagonizing the perpetrator, many will, either consciously or subconsciously, imply that the survivor is to blame for their own assault due to details such as their clothing, relationship status or degree of sobriety.
“As people look for that affirmation online, and they read any of the comments after the 40-some articles we looked at, they would see that a lot of people wouldn’t think they were legitimately sexually assaulted,” Zaleski said. “They would believe it was [their] fault, or that [they were] complicit in it, and that [they] might feel like the police or judicial system might also blame [them].”
Alexis also identified the double standards that come with speaking out about a sexual assault.
“There’s this huge irony that when a survivor does something unexpected, like speak out, people say they must not be a real survivor, because a real survivor would be ashamed,” Alexis said. “It’s in that same sense where … if you tell your story as a way to fight back, people might be less likely to believe you, because they believe people don’t fight back.”
Zaleski also warns against using social media as an outlet to immediately make sense of what has happened following a sexual assault. In times of trauma or vulnerability, she said that a face-to-face encounter with a professional should be the first priority.
“I would encourage my clients to be hesitant to post something so publicly when you can’t erase that, ever,” Zaleski said. “After you have some distance from the trauma, and are making sense of it and looking for support and guidance in the aftermath, I think that’s a better time to identify yourself and put it out there.”
In the same way, Alexis does not advocate for either speaking about ongoing sexual assault cases or revealing the identity of a sexual assault perpetrator on social media.
“When I posted about my story, I offered that if any woman at Chapman would like to know my perpetrator, they could message me privately and I will let them know who he is,” Alexis said. “But I didn’t broadcast it to the world.”
A changing landscape
The prevalence and permanence of social media continues to contribute to both its appeal and risk. In the Steubenville High School rape case of 2012, two high school football players were found guilty of publicly and repeatedly sexually assaulting a female student. Because the assault was documented on Facebook and Twitter, the case drew national attention for the influence of social media on the initial prosecution and later widespread outrage.
“The reason the men were caught is because they posted it online,” Zaleski said. “The detriment to that is that she, who had this horrible, violent, traumatizing thing happen to her, is now online forever, because of their actions.”
Despite its risks, however, Alexis believes that the ability to share freely on social media contributes to one of its biggest advantages.
“If you feel safe with the people you are linked with on social media…simply advocating for other survivors could be a form of healing,” Alexis said. “Educating [your friends] and expressing your frustrations, even if they are not knowledgeable of your situation, could be very helpful for you to get that indirect support.”

Early in April, I attended the campus organization recognition meeting at Bovard Auditorium to represent my sorority. As the speaker launched into a presentation about sexual assault prevention, the president of my sorority turned to me with exasperation — she had heard this same talk five other times as a leader in our house. Believe me, so has every other Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council president.
It’s no secret that greek life on any campus carries the burden and wears the blame for the vast majority of sexual assaults that occur on that campus. Although there are many reasons that fraternities and sororities should receive training to prevent these crimes from occurring, the stereotype is far overblown.I want to start this off by saying that I’m not dismissing anyone’s experiences with sexual assault. I’ve been sexually assaulted and so have many of my friends. Unfortunately, this isn’t an uncommon occurrence. Statistics cited by the Centers for Disease Control tell us that one out of every five women will be sexually assaulted during her time in college. They also say that women in sororities are more likely to be assaulted, and men in fraternities are more likely to assault.
One of the biggest stigmas around greek life at colleges is sexual assault. People will think of greek life and think that it’s an awful system because all they hear about in the news is incident after incident in which someone was assaulted at a fraternity party. This happens a lot, but realistically, it will happen anywhere on a college campus. It will happen in a dorm, it will happen with sports teams and it will happen between strangers and between friends.
A study conducted by psychologists David Lisak and Paul Miller found that around 6 percent of all college-age men will commit sexual assault in their time on campus.      That means that any time you have a group of over a 100 men together, there is statisical reason to believe that someone in that group might be inclined to sexually assault someone. It doesn’t matter if it’s a fraternity or a football team or a religious group, because it’s not about the organization — it’s about the individuals.
It’s easy to blame greek life as a whole for the actions of the people within it, but we should remember that these fraternities are not telling their members to sexually assault other people. Sexual assault is the result of an individual’s actions, and that’s what we should be focusing on. Those individuals are the ones we should be blaming for these situations because they are the ones responsible.
Sexual assault is an issue that every member of greek life is aware of, and fraternities and sororities are constantly working to improve risk management procedures and educating their members on what to do in these situations. As a member of a sorority, I’ve heard numerous risk seminars in the two years I’ve been at USC. Anyone in greek life will tell you about the depth of education on sexual assault they have received as a member of these organizations. Fraternities and sororities go through more sexual assault training than any other campus organization.
Sexual assault is an issue that we need to continue to address, and as a greek system we will do so. But to blame fraternities for the actions of their individual members is somewhat illogical, especially when people don’t blame any other organizations for their members perpetuating the same phenomenon.
All this being said, I know that when I go out to a fraternity, I need to be aware of my safety and my friends’ safety. However, I’m not afraid to go to a fraternity party because on the whole, they’re pretty fun. I go to see my friends at their parties, and it’s nice to get out and dance for a night. They’re easier to dance at than off-the-row parties, and they’re steps away from where I live, so if someone I know is feeling uncomfortable, we can leave easily. Any party situation can become unsafe for a variety of reasons, but I’ve never felt that the fraternities created a less safe environment.
Overall, we do need to keep the conversation about sexual assault on college campuses going because it is a prevalent issue. However, we should take a step back from judgement of greek life and ask how to change this culture throughout every organization on campus. Education needs to happen for all members of the university because ultimately, these unfortunate occurrences happen due to the actions of individuals. Blaming greek life rather than taking actions to change this culture isn’t helping anyone.

Football is a violent game.
Anyone who watches it, who loves it, will tell you that.
It’s a game about perseverance, about hard blows and ferocious tackles, about indomitable will and raw masculinity honed into 60 minutes of adrenaline-fueled aggression. The violence is disciplined into first downs and legal hits, but at its core, football taps into a love of physical competition.
Fans cheer for it on the gridiron. In the confines of the white lines painted on the grass of a football field, the violence is understandable, enjoyable. But what happens when that violence follows our stars off the field?
The game of football is riddled with accusations of domestic and sexual violence. And as more cases come to the surface, the question remains — what can be done?
The name of the game
Although male athletes only make up 3.3 percent of the student body of an average college campus, a study by the National Coalition Against Violent Student Athletes found that they account for 19 percent of the sexual assaults on their campuses.
Additionally, the study found that one in every three reported campus sexual assaults was committed by a student-athlete. Over 300 cases of sexual assault committed by student-athletes have been filed in the Nexis — a comprehensive database for public records and legal information — in the last two decades alone.
The issue of sexual assault in athletics is at its peak when applied to
football. Last year, both sexual and domestic violence in football dominated the headlines throughout the college and NFL seasons.
USC was in the spotlight in August 2016 after former linebacker Osa Masina was charged with rape in Utah and California. Although Masina and former teammate Don Hill were both removed from the football team immediately following their arrest, and were later expelled by USC, the incident was thrown into a pile of other NCAA football indiscretions headlined by Joe Mixon’s return to Oklahoma’s starting lineup and the Baylor football sexual assault scandal.
The past few seasons of college football have opened the eyes of fans, coaches and players to the underlying issue of violence in the sport. And at USC, Masina’s case in particular forced the administration to review the ways the school tackles the issue when dealing with an athlete.
Although USC athletes are often treated differently than other students, discipline for sexual misconduct is applied in the exact same way regardless of a student’s athletic status, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. This is meant to provide all students with a level playing field, where no athlete is protected by their on-field contributions to the school.
“It is the student code of conduct, not the student-athlete code of conduct,” Carry said. “The University has one code of conduct, and it is for all students. We follow the procedure to the letter for any member of the community. Our procedures are indifferent to what you participate in as a member of the University community.”
A spokesperson for USC Athletics said that the athletics department defers to student affairs in handling student conduct issues regarding student-athletes.
“This assures that student-athletes are treated like all students and do not receive special treatment because of their athletic standing,” the spokesperson said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
This situation is not unfamiliar for USC Athletics — in the last three decades, the school has seen four separate sexual assault charges or accusations, including one involving former quarterback Mark Sanchez in 2006. Only Masina’s case resulted in an expulsion, although former tight end Bryce Dixon was banned from the football team despite being allowed to re-enroll at USC. Two of the accused former players are now NFL athletes.
Violence off the field is not an issue that is unique to USC, and it continues all the way into the NFL. In 2015, Vice reported that 44 active NFL players charged with or accused of sexual or domestic violence in their careers as college and professional athletes were still playing in the NFL. Three were starting quarterbacks. On average, each brought in a yearly salary of more than $2 million.
Some of these men were acquitted by juries. Others were acquitted in the eyes of fans and owners who value on-the-field performance over off-the-field disciplinary issues. It’s a debate that tears at front offices throughout the league — what should teams do when facing a question between a talented future and an allegedly violent past?
The answer is typically the same. In a business like football, aptitude trumps anything else.
Second chance universities
But what happens when a player is dismissed?
In the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs rode the success of wide receiver Tyreek Hill all the way to an AFC West championship, less than three years after he pinned his ex-girlfriend to the wall with one hand around her throat, beating her face with his other fist. The incident occurred in his first season as a wide receiver at Oklahoma State University. Hill pled guilty to domestic abuse after defending himself as not guilty for half a year and in the meantime, he was kicked out of the university.
Now, he’s a starter for an NFL team, successful, beloved by fans after a breakout season in Kansas City. The question is obvious — how did a man who was kicked out of Oklahoma State for beating his pregnant girlfriend bloody end up back in the NFL?
When players are removed from their Division I programs, they often find a new home in a lower division or junior college program. These schools feed off of the talent of athletes with Division I talent who couldn’t cut it for myriad reasons — grades, attitudes or student conduct violations.
The vast majority of transfers to junior colleges or Division III programs are simply athletes who needed a second shot at college ball. They use a year or two in a less prestigious program to pull up their grades, rehab from an injury or earn new looks from other potential programs. This system helps many athletes find their footing in the competitive world of football — stars such as Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Johnson got their start in these schools.
But a small percentage of these athletes are overcoming past violence to get ahead. For instance, Lane College accepted a transfer last August despite his dismissal from Vanderbilt University due to five charges of aggravated rape. Another player charged in the same case transferred to Alcorn State University, a Division I school that already fields a registered sex offender.
This is how Hill found his way back to a university even after his expulsion. He was picked up by the University of West Alabama, then by the Chiefs in the fifth round of the draft. Many teams dropped Hill from their draft boards even after he ran an impressive 4.24-second 40-yard dash.
But teams such as the Chiefs, who were grasping for any opportunity to kick-start their offense, were willing to ignore past crimes in order to bring in new talent. The team’s front office did its best to address the issue, with head coach Andy Reid issuing statements about Hill’s improvement.
“This country gives you a second chance, if you handle yourself the right way,” Reid said following a Chiefs practice in an interview.
But despite Reid’s sureness, the discomfort of handling the issue was clear. Even more uncomfortable was the decision fans were forced to make every Sunday — whether or not to cheer for a former domestic abuser.
“It always gets into those fine lines of second chances,” NBC commentator Cris Collinsworth said during Kansas City’s game against Denver last season. “Maybe you don’t deserve a second chance sometimes.”
Masina awaits pending litigation for the charges in Utah, the charges in Los Angeles having been dropped in March. If he is cleared, Masina, like Hill, could be picked up by a smaller school and funneled back into the NFL.
It’s not an easy path to follow. But history has proven that even when athletes commit crimes and receive punishments in full, a future in the NFL is still in the cards. The result is a system in which athletes circumvent punishments through raw talent and a faith in second chances.
Looking downfield
This can’t last forever.
Across the country, college and professional programs are beginning to catch on. The University of Indiana recently enacted a policy that bans its athletics programs from recruiting or adding any new players with histories of domestic or sexual violence. And the NFL refused to invite star athletes like Joe Mixon, who was suspended for a season after breaking a female student’s jaw in his freshman year.
But the solution involves more than simply preventing athletes with a history of violence from reentering the system. The NCAA developed a nationwide training program called Step UP!, which aims to teach administrators, coaches and athletes how to approach issues ranging from drug addiction to domestic violence and sexual assault.
Through the program, former Arizona and NFL wide receiver Syndric Steptoe has used his knowledge as a former athlete to advocate for preventing assaults. In order to truly solve the issue of violence in athletics, Steptoe believes that the culture of male-dominant sports must change as a whole.
The main problem, he said, is the treatment that comes with an athlete’s stardom.
Steptoe watched this culture unfold in his own life, and it started young — high school coaches scouted youth leagues, mentoring prospects from a young age. Those same coaches built plays and programs around their stars when they reached high school. They also rearranged players’ class schedule, wrote passes to get them out of class early to travel to games and talked to teachers to smooth over failed midterms or papers.
When a star reaches a college like USC, Steptoe said, the bubble surrounding them has only widened. From personalized meal plans to one-on-one tutoring sessions, universities do their best to cater to the physical and mental needs of their stars in order to maintain their academic eligibility and overall well-being. But at the same time, Steptoe believes that this level of attention can serve to feed the egos and ignore the missteps of a school’s biggest stars.
“There’s this idea of what it means to be a star, what it means to be a man,” Steptoe said. “We have to change the little things, the little ways that we’re talking to our boys. When we’re looking at the sport, we have to look at how we’re raising kids in it and start at the very beginning of it.”
According to Step UP! founder Becky Bell, this is where the emphasis of preventative education must begin. Her program teaches that attitudes surrounding sexual assault are often communicated in day-to-day conversations. For athletes, this means that violence prevention must come from coaches, trainers and fellow teammates.
“A lot of this is breaking down the stigma and the culture that has been built up for so long surrounding athletics,” Bell said. “We need, as a whole, to be having honest conversations about these topics and to be encouraging our students and our athletes to be having the same honest conversations. It’s as small as correcting an inappropriate comment in the locker room, but those little details [can] be the start of finding a bigger solution.”
Bell is quick to emphasize that there isn’t a single solution for ending sexual assault in athletics. But the path toward finding an answer involves these steps — putting pressure on athletes to correct behavior on a daily basis while implementing no-tolerance policies at the administrative level.
The future of sexual assault prevention in athletics is young and still uncertain, Bell says. However, she believes that college programs and NFL front offices now have the tools, the information and the resources to begin fighting back against this issue.
For now, the ball is in their hands.

They never listened.
In February 2013, Alexa Schwartz told USC’s Center for Women and Men, now the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, that she had been sexually assaulted.
Schwartz, then a junior majoring in theatre, waited three months and heard nothing back. No updates, no acknowledgement, no plan for action. When she returned to the center, she said that she found that the counselor she first spoke to hadn’t reported her case. Schwartz felt that her trauma had been forgotten.
Her alleged assailant, she said, had remained enrolled at USC, on track to graduate two weeks later. The only option for recourse remaining would take place after his graduation. In Schwartz’ eyes, the case had simply slipped through the University’s fingers.
Schwartz is one of many students who feel that the University didn’t listen to their stories of sexual assault. Now, she hopes to prevent this from happening to anyone else at USC.
After her experience, she banded together with other students who went through similar experiences to seek justice under Title IX, a law that prohibits gender discrimination in education. A total of 16 students and alumni who alleged their cases had been mishandled by the Title IX office at USC filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which agreed to investigate the University in July 2013.
“We started as a small group and then pulled more people in over social media,” Schwartz said. “Just asking people to spread the word that we’re looking for anyone who experienced any kind of issues with their investigations, or any negative experiences with the University, and it really blew up.”
Almost four years later, USC remains under federal investigation for alleged violations of students’ Title IX rights, facing accusations that it mishandled and underreported cases of rape and sexual assault.
In those four years, the University implemented programs and procedures for preventing and reporting assault, some of which were direct responses to the investigation. But students and administrators still cite difficulties within the University, despite increased awareness about campus sexual assault.
Under investigation  
When the federal investigation of USC first began, Schwartz was joined by two other students — Ari Mostov and Tucker Reed. Both claim that they turned to their university following a sexual assault only to have their stories go ignored.
The Title IX Office declined to comment on the investigations of Mostov, Reed and Schwartz.
Mostov said an officer dismissed her rape when she first reported it to the Department of Public Safety. She said he argued that a rape couldn’t happen if the assailant didn’t orgasm, despite the fact that penetration occurred.
“Because he stopped, it was not rape,” Mostov was told, according to the Title IX complaint. “Even though his penis penetrated your vagina, because he stopped, it was not a crime.”
This does not align with the definition of assault provided by the Department of Justice, which states that sexual assault is any coercive, nonconsensual sexual contact. But because of an officer’s personal interpretation, Mostov’s case was left ignored.
Reed’s experience followed the same pattern. She said that in 2013, she offered the administration an audio recording of her ex-boyfriend admitting to assault. Instead of offering a punishment, the university official informed her that their goal was to offer an “educative” process to students who commit assaults.
“The problems are rampant within every department, pretty much every service on campus,” Reed told the Huffington Post. “There is an overwhelming disregard for women and students going through obvious trauma, and they traumatized them further.”
The investigation spurred the University to improve systems to both prevent sexual assault and encourage victims to report incidents. This process included adding a coordinator to improve the training of campus security authorities, USC Title IX Coordinator and Executive Director Gretchen Means wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan in August 2016.
Training and prevention programs are continually being refined and reworked. The administration coordinates with University organizations such as the Engemann Student Health Center and the Office for Wellness and Health promotion, along with student organizations and cultural centers.
Yet despite these efforts, the federal Title IX investigation of USC continues, leaving the three women who first launched it to wonder if their stories will ever be heard.
For Schwartz, the key to stopping sexual assault begins with reporting. Victims must feel safe enough to report their assaults to the University, she said, while the administration must be ready to listen and to help.
Currently, only 20 percent of victims report assaults to the police, according to the U.S. Justice Department. This statistic makes prevention tricky, because a higher number of reports could reflect that students are comfortable speaking out about the issue.
This means lower rates could indicate a more repressive environment rather than a safer one, according to Schwartz, who emphasized the importance of a climate in which survivors feel safe coming forward.
“You’re never actually going to go down to zero any time soon, so you want to hear about the sexual assaults that are happening,” Schwartz said. “If you think that there are zero going on, then there might be a communication problem.”

Then and now
The solution, however, doesn’t end with reporting. In the wake of the Title IX investigation, the University increased its focus on preventative programs. These include mandatory online courses such as “AlcoholEdu” and “On the Safe Side,” which new students must take before registering for classes.
But Means believes that these programs cannot completely prevent assault on campus.
“Effective prevention is multi-disciplinary, delivered in a variety of mediums and reinforced by cultural forces inside and outside of the University,” Means said. “Students come to school with diverse experiences and backgrounds, [which] means that we need to design prevention programs that meet students where they are. USC is working hard to create prevention programming that can meet this reality.”
Schwartz also believes that the climate surrounding sexual assault has changed since 2013. She sees programs such as Violence Outreach Intervention and the Community Empowerment peer-to-peer education program as a sign that students are invested in prevention.
“A lot of students really care about this issue, and want to make a positive change and get trained and help out,” Schwartz said. “That feels very different culturally than from when I was a student — [dialogue about sexual assault] was very taboo, and there was no such program.”
After her assault, Schwartz learned firsthand the burden of reporting and sharing experiences with both the government and fellow survivors. But she feels the conversation is worth the effort.
“Before we started with the activism, I felt pretty alone and I didn’t really hear people talking about this very much, and I didn’t really know how to talk about this myself,” Schwartz said. “I’m proud of what we’ve done and what I’ve done.”
Yet, Carry believes that the momentum of the movement has begun to stall.
“I want to get back to the days when students were banging down my door saying, ‘Let’s do something to end sexual misconduct on our campus’ — I miss it,” Carry said. “I really want students to get fired up about this again. I don’t want this to become, ‘Oh, that was important in 2013’ — until we get to zero, this is still important.”
Shyann Murphy, the former director of the Women’s Student Assembly — now the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment — agreed that, at the height of Schwartz’s case, activism was strong. But she believes the conversation has turned in a new direction rather than stalling.
“I think that when I first came to USC a lot of the conversation was, ‘If someone’s drunk, they’re not consenting,’” Murphy said. “Now I see the conversation going toward, ‘how can we support survivors, how can we change these things, get bystanders to intervene.’ I think that conversation is evolving. I’d like to see it evolve even more so that people can … look at rape culture and look at how it’s so intersectional with so many other marginalities.”
Chasing zero
The ultimate goal, Carry says, is for sexual assault to never happen again.
It’s a goal that Carry calls “chasing zero” — zero sexual assaults reported on campus for an entire school year. According to Carry, the preventative measures and programs already developed by the administration reflect this mission.
“How do we stop these things from happening?” Carry said. “It’s bold, it’s ambitious, it’s crazy, some people might say, but we owe it to our students to chase zero in this issue. [Sexual assault] changes people’s lives in a very dramatic way, and I think we can be a better university than having more than one incident of sexual misconduct every year.”
Despite this goal, the numbers of forcible sexual offenses — listed by DPS as rape, fondling, incest and statutory rape — reported by DPS have remained constant over the past four years. In its 2016 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, DPS reported that sexual offenses fell from 33 in 2013 to 31 in 2014 before rising to 41 in 2015.
Carry and Means embrace the fact that the Title IX process still has room for improvement. The waiting period for victims typically lasts 60 to 90 days, according to Means, though the U.S. Department of Education recommends a 60-day turnaround. Understaffing may be one reason for the delay — the RSVP staff consists of three counselors, which Murphy says is not enough to help students in the way they deserve.
“So many people need [RSVP’s help] and need those services,” Murphy said. “The counselors are really busy, and they’re also doing programming and educational workshops — [they] need more people, resources and money to program.”
For Carry, a crucial solution to achieving the University’s goal of zero sexual assaults digs down to a more basic level — demanding that students live up to Trojan values.
“If students saw everybody as their sister, their mom or their brother, and they intervened — what would you do if somebody was doing that to your sister? — you would intervene,” Carry said. “That shared responsibility for each other — that’s going to be a huge help in getting us to zero.”
Every six months, Schwartz contacts the Office of Civil Rights for updates on the investigation, and asks when the investigation will be closed. The answers are always the same, always brief — the case is ongoing. In four years, she says, her case hasn’t changed.
As years have passed, Schwartz has become increasingly doubtful about the direction and timeline of the investigation.
“Now that there’s so many schools under investigation, it feels less likely they’re going to reach a new conclusion since they have such a small staff,” Schwartz said. “I’m wondering how much longer it’s going to take for this investigation to finish, because I’m not really sure what they’re still looking for.”
She doesn’t know if her case will ever be resolved. But Schwartz hopes for a future where students like her will feel brave enough to come forward and where, this time, the University will listen.

As I am writing this, we are on the precipice of the frenzy that comes with the production of our Spring 2017 supplement, “Chasing Zero.” It’s hard to believe that this night will essentially cap my efforts as editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan.
It’s an especially sentimental accomplishment because this supplement topic is the main reason why I ran for editor-in-chief last fall. I was most excited about the opportunity to shape a reporting package that seeks to reignite the dialogue around sexual assault at USC.
Every day at the Daily Trojan, our staff works hard to report the day-to-day news on campus. Sometimes this includes sexual assaults — but we’ve always been hindered by the limited information given, he said, she said back-and-forths and the ultimate lack of reporting.
Though campus sexual assault may cycle through headlines, it does not need a news peg in order to find relevance. As long as 29.7 percent of undergraduate women at USC still experience some form of rape or sexual violence — as a survey by the Association of American Universities found in 2015 — sexual assault will always be a pressing, pertinent and relevant issue.
Four years after the federal government launched an investigation of USC for mishandling cases of sexual assault, the University remains under scrutiny by the Office of Civil Rights.
Having heard heartbreaking testimonies from close friends who are survivors of sexual assault, I can’t imagine an issue that is more deeply personal. The wounds from their trauma will always be fresh. They will carry these burdens for the rest of their lives.
We heard these stories in “Justice is having every story heard — unfiltered,” in which we explore how survivors can achieve justice. We looked into the Title IX reporting process in “Four years later, campus investigation stalls,” which reconciles the strides made by the University on this issue and student voices requesting what still needs to be done. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry revealed that the administration’s goal is not to decrease rates of sexual assault by a target number, but to “chase zero.” And we feature a letter to the editor, which defends the greek system’s role in the sexual assault conversation.
We also explored the way that gender-based violence operates in our modern context. In “How social media shapes the sexual assault narrative” we examined the impact of social media in giving survivors control of their own narratives — or hurting them in the process. “Going the Distance” spotlights a group of students hoping to bring rape kits to campus, given the distance University’s recommended rape treatment.
In this supplement, we Daily Trojan editors set out to accomplish an extraordinary task. We put the sexual assault prevention and adjudication process under a microscope; we sought to return the dialogue around sexual assault to relevance, and shine a light on its many nuances.
In this task, we encountered challenges unlike those I’ve seen in any other supplement. We’ve filtered our sources to ensure accuracy. We’ve used targeted, precise language to protect our interview subjects who are sexual assault survivors. We’ve taken great care to keep stories balanced. When they have requested it, we’ve kept the identities of survivors anonymous in order to keep them safe.
And through it all, we’ve hoped to create a platform for the voices of survivors. We’ve hoped to share their stories, as well as analyze the complex interplays between universities, Title IX and athletic departments. We’ve hoped to equip student activists with more information about what the University needs to do to effectively address sexual assault.
I went into this project thinking that I could easily create change. But the issue is so complicated, and there is a great deal of editorial responsibility that lies within a supplement about a campus topic that is so delicate, yet so important.
During a time when the current Title IX protections become vulnerable under the current presidential administration, it is important that the University continues to uphold and expand upon its efforts to combat sexual assault. What we have found in this supplement is that sexual assault prevention is a partnership between students and administrators. We hope that by reading this supplement, you will be inspired to continue the fight.

When Nathalye Lopez was in high school, she was fascinated by science.
Her school, the James A. Foshay Learning Center, had too many people and too little funding for students to do experiments on their own. Teachers would demonstrate in front of the class, or sometimes just show pictures, but Lopez always wanted to do more.
For a large part of each weekday, Lopez studied at Foshay, where some students didn’t have a seat to sit in and many classes would only get through half the agenda because of disruptions and disciplinary actions.
But for two hours each morning and four hours each Saturday, Lopez headed to USC to take classes through the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a program the University offers to help students from the local community receive a more intensive education.
“The teachers at Foshay were passionate, but they didn’t have the resources to provide each student with individual attention,” Lopez said. “At USC, we were in an actual laboratory and were doing experiments ourselves.”
Lopez is now a junior majoring in human biology and contemporary Latino and Latin American studies at USC, as well as a Gates Millennium Scholar. She’s one of around 60 students to graduate from NAI each year, all of whom come from South Central Los Angeles and spend middle and high school at the Foshay Learning Center.
Most are students from low-income families, members of a minority group and the first in their families to go to college — and all are offered the opportunity to attend USC on a 4.5-year scholarship if they graduate from the program and are accepted to the University.
As a result, Foshay sent 30 students to USC in 2016 — the most of any high school in the country. Graduates of the program who don’t attend USC go on to other colleges such as the University of California or numerous Ivy League schools, bringing NAI’s college attendance rate to 98 percent.
Parents who enroll their kids in the program — such as Ivonne Rodriguez, whose 14-year-old daughter is in NAI — credit the organization for helping their children develop the motivation to pursue a college education.
“My daughter came from an environment where she was one of the brightest kids in a class and moved into a program where she was with kids that thought the same way — they all want to work hard, they all want to encourage each other,” Rodriguez said. “Now she has a plan [for college], and she’s only in eighth grade. That changes the narrative for scholars in our community who see themselves as scholars, not just students — and that’s powerful.”
NAI has enrolled students each year since 1991, but Rodriguez — who also works as a project specialist for NAI — said that Executive Director Kim Thomas-Barrios has increased standards and changed the conversation in recent years. According to Rodriguez, students are no longer talking about whether they will even go to college, but about which selective college they will attend.
“This program transforms people’s lives,” Rodriguez said. “It becomes this equalizer in education … so when [these students] enter their senior year of high school, they are competitive candidates to go to college.”
Students typically enter the program in sixth grade through a selective application process and spend seven years taking extra classes at USC on weekday mornings and Saturdays, receiving extra after-school tutoring, attending workshops to develop study habits and participating in enrichment activities such as theater workshops.
NAI participants like Jessica Hernandez-Flores, a senior at the Foshay Learning Center who plans to attend USC in the fall, said that these rigorous lessons have helped her expand her academic abilities.
“It was different from middle school because they pushed you,” Hernandez-Flores said. “When I entered high school they told me that I had to be more independent, and they pushed me to … do things on my own.”
For Lopez, NAI was not just a means to achieve a more rigorous education or develop her interest in science. It was also a practical program that allowed her — and her parents — to understand how to apply to and attend college. As the child of immigrant parents who fled the civil war in Guatemala in the 1990s, Lopez never believed that a college education was possible for her — until she enrolled in NAI, which provided standardized test preparation, workshops on financial aid and special lessons for parents on the college application process.
“Whenever the talk came of applying to college, it was something foreign — I had never heard about it and didn’t know anything about it,” Lopez said. “My parents don’t know how to fill out an application, how to use a computer — they can’t even speak English that well. So it was reassuring that there were people [at NAI] to help you for something that seemed out of your reach.”

On Jan. 10, USC joined 1,827 higher education institutions across the country in prohibiting smoking on campus. The University banned cigarettes, e-cigarettes, hookahs and other products on all University-owned property, including fraternity and sorority houses on the Row. However, enforcing this policy has been difficult — and with the rise in popularity of new forms of smoking, students are continuing to engage in an activity that USC is trying to eradicate.
USC’s Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution supporting a campus-wide ban on smoking in March 2016, and the Academic Senate — a consultative body of professors representing the interests of the faculty — followed up with a resolution of its own in September before the change was formally adopted by the University in January.
But enforcement of the policy rests on the administration and the Department of Public Safety. DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that when DPS officers see someone smoking on campus, the standard procedure is to inform them of the policy and hand them a small card containing information about smoking cessation programs offered on campus.
“We rarely get a complaint about people violating the no-smoking policy,” Carlisle said.
Some students said they have continued to smoke on campus because they disagree with the idea of an absolute ban and believe that people who want to smoke should have an opportunity to do so.
“Some people smoke for fun, and some people smoke because they’re addicted, but it’s their right to smoke,” said Jad Saleh, an e-cigarette user, who is also a freshman majoring in business administration. “I think there should at least be designated spots for people who smoke so they don’t have to go off campus.”
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, and nearly one in 10 college students in America die prematurely because of tobacco use, according to the Academic Senate’s proposal to ban smoking on campus. Paula Cannon, president of the Academic Senate, said that the Senate developed its proposal to mitigate the potential for harm that cigarettes pose to the University community.
“We had quite thoughtful discussions [at] the Academic Senate on this topic,” Cannon said. “What swayed us this year was the quantity and quality of evidence against smoking — not just how it impacts all of us whenever we encounter it, but also the impact of secondhand smoke.”
But some students — such as Olivia Marshall, a freshman majoring in real estate development — think that the ban should not apply to all forms of smoking. Marshall said e-cigarettes and vape pens should be permitted on campus, since they can cause less harm to the environment.
“When it comes to e-cigarette usage, there’s no worry about secondhand smoke,” Marshall said. “[And] no one is leaving their cigarette butts anywhere.”
She also added that JUULs, electronic cigarettes with a high concentration of nicotine, have become increasingly popular with USC students, especially because of their size and convenience. E-cigarettes are known to be as addictive as other tobacco products, according to a study from the American Chemical Society. Nine out of 17 common, commercially available e-cigarettes contain the most addictive kind of nicotine, according to TIME magazine.
JUULs fall under the no-smoking policy due to their status as an e-cigarette. But despite their popularity with students, Cannon said the benefits of a smoke-free campus outweigh the rights of individual students to use any form of tobacco products.
“While we all grow up with different habits and expectations as to what’s normal, when we join a pluralistic society like USC, I think we also take on the fact that there are just certain things we do because we want to be good neighbors and we want to do the things that are the most socially acceptable to the most people,” Cannon said. “It’s imperfect, but I think on so many levels smoking is really not acceptable.”
Bet they are fighting hard for the same rights to smoke/inhale/eat THC or marijuana.
The second hand smoke argument is a red herring it always was.  The goal of smoking bans is the forced denormalization of smokers.  The so-called scientific evidence is health advocacy not actual science.
As a well established example I call attention to the series of fabrications about so-called ‘heart attack” miracles that resulted after smoking bans were imposed. For example consider, “National Study Debunks Helena Smoking Ban Miracle (Again)} where an analysis of data from nearly 2,000 counties finds no evidence that smoking restrictions produce short-term reductions in heart attacks. See Ho V, et al. A Nationwide Assessment of the Association of Smoking Bans and Cigarette Taxes With Hospitalizations for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia. Med Care Res Rev. 2016 Sep 12.
“The most addictive kind of nicotine”?  There are different kinds?
You guys realize that the nicotine in electronic cigarettes (if used) is the same nicotine that is used in the patch, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays.
You don’t hear about a drug store getting robbed of nicotine patches, do you?
Nicotine is no more addictive (or dangerous) than caffeine.  So before you go on a rant about nicotine addiction, you may want to put down your cup of Starbucks.
Everyday governments, universities, hospitals and corporations are making vaping e-cigarettes illegal everywhere smoking cigarettes is outlawed because they are bogus harm reduction and a smoking cessation hoax. E-cigarettes emit some of the same toxins and carcinogens in cigarette smoke, plus some,such as nickel, at higher levels than in cigarette smoke and others, such as propylene oxide and glycidol, not even found in cigarette smoke. The danger from inhaling e-cigarette emissions was actually established long ago when occupational safety authorities determined that special effects fog machine emissions are harmful to inhale. E-cigarettes are merely handheld toy fog machines that electrically heat glycols to generate fog exactly like the special effects fog machines. The only difference is that e-cigarettes are battery powered, and as it has turned out those Li ion batteries add another danger to the fog toys because they detonate and incinerate, searing throats, impaling tongues, charring lips, breaking teeth, blistering faces, fracturing jaws and burning hands. These injuries have also been inflicted on bystanders. As for caffeine, again more and more jurisdictions ban vaping e-cigarettes and smoking cigarettes but none of them anywhere has ever prohibited drinking coffee. None. Anywhere. Ever.
What a silly response!  How can e-cigarettes emit the same toxins as cigarette smoke when their ingredients are only Propylene Glycol (used by hospitals in their air purification systems), Vegetable Glycol (used in common cosmetics), flavoring used everywhere and, optionally, nicotine?  Danger to bystanders from e-cigarettes has never been established anywhere — in fact, examination of the air in homes where vapers live shows that the air is almost identical to the air in non-smokers’ homes.
Your example of caffeine shows a strange logic. In fact, because nicotine is not particularly addictive when it isn’t combined with the chemicals in tobacco cigarettes, its effect is similar to that of caffeine.  If the university is banning vaping because of the “dangers” of nicotine, it should similarly ban caffeine!  (And I can just see that happening!)
The proof of toxins and carcinogens emitted by cigarettes come from research done by Berkeley National Laboratory. Neither air purification systems nor cosmetics electrically heat glycols and/or glycerin. Flavorings are not used everywhere and nicotine is exactly the addictive ingredient in both cigarette tobacco leaves and e-cigarettes with nicotine e-liquid. Bystanders have been treated for both burns and ballistic trauma when the e-cigarette someone nearby is using detonates and incinerates, becoming flaming shrapnel flying in all directions.
Quite honestly, I have little faith in research from Berkeley — it relies too heavily on financial support from the pharmaceutical industry that is trying desperately to destroy the vaping industry.  One of the reports that came out of there screamed about toxins in tissue exposed to vapour for a number of weeks, but failed to mention that the same tissue type exposed to cigarette smoke died within a couple of days.
No one claims that vaping is 100% safe, but nothing is 100% safe in life, and if a smoker has tried in vain to stop through other means,  a switch to vaping becomes a life-saver.
The explosions are caused by the lithium batteries. Cell phones use the same batteries and have exploded in the same way.  It’s too bad that regulators are spending so much energy on demonizing vaping instead of urging education about the proper handling and use of these batteries.
Cell phones have not “exploded in the same way” because they don’t contain a flammable liquid as e-cigarettes do, and yes propylene glycol is flammable when preheated, which is exactly what an e-cigarette does to it. Bystanders deserve to be protected from incorrigible nicotine addicts and their peculiar recreational substance abuse.
Cell phones explode quite regularly — check the news.  However, I’m beginning to understand what’s going on here, and have decided that this bystander deserves to be protected from incorrigible self-righteousness and rudeness.
The liquid isn’t what explodes in vapor.  Most of the time, the news is mis-reporting… saying “E-cig catches fire in man’s pocket” should actually read “Loose battery with change in man’s pocket catches fire”.
Meanwhile, propylene glycol is considered “slightly flammable” at high temperatures, according to the MSDS.  You’d have to be dripping at high wattage, then strike a lighter to actually get it to burn.
Exactly, overheating lithium batteries expel a flammable gas. That is where the flames come from NOT from the eliquid.
Ha, Berkeley!! You didn’t just cite Berkeley…Sorry, I’ve been reading the entire thread (up until this point) and it just lost all credibility. Funny Stuff.  Berkeley..
Yes, this is happening everywhere because people read headlines in the tabloids and press releases without doing some investigation into the real research that is being done internationally.  Millions of smokers around the world have thrown away their cigarettes and now enjoy better health because they’ve switched to vaping. A hoax?  Sorry, dear — I’m not a hoax — I stopped smoking instantly 3 years ago after being enslaved to tobacco for 40 years. Since then, I’ve taken the trouble to educate myself on the subject.  If you are a student, this is a habit you should develop.
The research proving that inhaling electrically heated glycols and/or glycerine was already done decades ago, is more than headlines and you clearly have not educated yourself because you are a delusional and incorrigible nicotine addict like so many others who are still enslaved to nicotine, swapping nicotine in tobacco leaves for nicotine in e-liquid instead of actually liberating yourself from any and all nicotine substance abuse. If you are a student did you graduate?
Of course I graduated — in several fields, actually, but that’s neither here nor there. I have found, since I started vaping, that I’ve decreased my nicotine levels considerably and naturally; this is a common experience among vapers because, as I’ve said before, nicotine is no more addictive than caffeine away from tobacco cigarettes.   Did you know that medical research shows that nicotine slows the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases?  Nothing in life, Carl, is black and white
Ahhh… the abstinence / addiction rant.
Well, enjoy your holier-than-thou nicotine addiction rant over your cup of coffee… bar of chocolate… blunt… line of coke… sex… exercise… whatever you’re addicted to.
Ahhh…the flirting with libel/slander rant
Oh… .and you’re correct that they tested theatrical fog machines back in the 70’s, and tested Propylene Glycol as early as the 1940’s… and guess what?  Your statement of findings is incorrect.  Fog machines were found to cause no harm.
If this restriction is so important the school should not admit smoking students who will live on campus because the only way they can smoke is to loiter on someone else’s property.  Banning ecigarettes is a missed opportunity.  Allowing them on campus encourages smokers to switch which can save them a lot of money to help pay tuition and may be they will live longer and eventually donate some money back to the school as alumni because they are grateful for the support they got from the school to help them stop smoking.  Quitting smoking would be more important to their long term well being than anything they learn going to class because knowledge isn’t very useful if you are dead.

Alumnus Rick Caruso, who graduated from USC in 1980, received the most distinguished alumni honor, the Asa V. Call Award, at the 83rd annual Alumni Awards.
Nikias presented Caruso with the award on Saturday. The award signifies commitment to USC and to the community. Caruso’s ties to USC stretch back to his times as a Trojan. The Carusos have donated more than $50 million to the school.
The family’s endowments include the USC Caruso Catholic Center and, most recently, a $25 million endowment for the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology. The treatment facility for the ear, nose and throat is set to be one of the largest in the country.
“Rick Caruso’s immense pride for USC is unsurpassed,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said to USC News. “His love of the school is visible across our campuses. With inspired generosity, Rick and his wife, Tina, are putting into practice their philanthropic vision, which will benefit Trojans for many generations to come.”
Caruso said that USC has had a profound impact on his life and career.
“I am so honored to receive this award from USC,” Caruso told USC News. “My years at USC fundamentally changed my perspective on what it means to be part of a community,and what my responsibilities are as a member of that community. There isn’t a better university that changes the lives of young people so significantly, and they have won my respect, commitment, devotion and gratitude.”
In addition to Caruso, six Trojans were awarded for their contributions to USC: Wanda M. Austin, Grant Gerson, Wilfred Uytengsu, Allyson Felix, Dan Cassidy and Vicki McCluggage.
