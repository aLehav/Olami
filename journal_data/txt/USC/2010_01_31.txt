Former USC football star and Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga has pleaded not guilty to charges of drunken and careless driving on January 29th. Maualuga was arrested by police at 3:11 a.m. Friday morning in northern Kentucky after hitting a parking meter and two parked cars, Covington police said.
After being held at the Kenton County jail for seven hours, Maualuga was released and ordered to return for a hearing next month.
Maualuga, 23, was driving a 2003 Pontiac Sunfire at the time of the accident which caused only minor damage. His blood alcohol level was reported to be twice the legal limit and he admitted to police that he had about six alcoholic drinks earlier that night.
A police report states that Maualuga had slurred speech, blood eyes and was unsteady on his feet.
Two females, a 17 year-old and an 18 year-old, were also in the car with him at the time of the incident, but neither were arrested.
Maualuga started at linebacker for USC for three years where he had 273 career tackles, 22.5 tackles for losses, nine sacks and five interceptions.
He was chosen 38th overall in the second round of the 2009 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals where he signed a four-year deal worth $4.66 million, which included $2.84 million in guaranteed money.
He started 15 games for Cincinnati in his first season before breaking his left ankle Dec. 27 against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Any pizza. Any size. Any crust. Any toppings.
Pizza Hut’s latest promotion, sensationally titled “$10 Pizza Days,” has made Americans an offer they’ll likely prove helpless to refuse. The tagline accompanying each mention of the new deal promises “thousands of pizza possibilities” for a flat $10. And the mathematics are sound, if not understated: Daily Trojan computations indicate the potential for no less than 2,285,824 distinct and unique pizza possibilities.
This figure is contingent on a few stipulations to the deal, none of which you’ll ever find appearing in a font larger than size eight. The small print reveals an additional charge for Stuffed Crust Pizza, and a provision against double toppings. Anecdotal evidence from the Daily Trojan‘s own Pedro Moura also reveals a five-topping cap: while attempting to place an order online, Moura was precluded from requesting any more than five of Pizza Hut’s 16 available toppings. A paltry four crust options — Pan Pizza, Personal Pan Pizza, Hand-Tossed Style Pizza and Thin ‘N Crispy — are available to customers who don’t wish to accrue additional fees.
With these restrictions in mind, the figure arrived at earlier was arrived at in this way:
The four total crust options were multiplied times the sixteen total topping options available to customers for their first topping, times the 15 remaining unused topping options available for topping # 2 — no repeated toppings, remember? — times the 14 now available, etc.
4 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 = 2,096,640 pizza options, but some might not be interested in using all five toppings. That can be corrected with a few additions:
(4 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13) + (4 * 16 * 15 * 14) + (4 * 16 * 15) + (4 * 16) = 174,720 + 13,440 + 960 + 64 = 189,184 different pizzas available, should the customer be disinclined to avail him- or herself of all five included toppings.
Add that to the number of possible combinations if all five toppings are used, and you’ll arrive at 2,285,824 total pizza options.
The number is admittedly staggering — enticing, even. And it’s this allure of nearly unimaginable possibilities that will likely prove a boon for Pizza Hut.
The same logic underlies buffets. The commercial viability of these free-for-all smorgasbords is beyond impugn, and is owed to precisely the same logic that will likely buoy Pizza Hut sales during the limited run of this most recent deal. Customers enter a buffet — or dial Pizza Hut — with every intention of getting their money’s worth and more, of taking advantage of the deal, of making corporate higher-ups rue the day they ever green-lit such an open-ended deal. In the grand scheme of things, however, these deals are offered because they are profitable for the company making the offer. Pizza Hut anticipates your ambition, but realizes your limitations.
In cases such as Pizza Hut’s “$10 Pizza Days,” The Man is difficult — if not impossible — to stick it to.
haha. funniness.
Wow, this will keep UCLA Bruin alumni busy with deliveries.
This article has everything one would want from a lifestyle section: a flurry of math, a slice of the latest pizza-news, and humor upon humor. I loved it!.

In the first partnership of its kind, the USC Keck School of Medicine and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences are collaborating to create a new advising program for all undergraduate students looking to enter the medical profession.
The program, tentatively called the College-Keck School of Medicine Pre-health Academic and Advising Program, will tailor advising for students who plan to go to medical school and allow undergraduates to utilize Keck’s resources.
“We’ve had partnerships before about ‘how do we enhance the experience for undergraduates with Keck’ but nothing on this scale,” said Michael Quick, executive vice dean of the College.
Until now, the College has offered pre-health advising to those students admitted to the Baccalaureate/M.D. program, which guarantees students admission to Keck at the same time they are admitted as freshmen. This advising is now being enhanced and expanded to all students following a pre-health track.
The advising program will be a component of the Office of College Advising but will partner with Keck experts to provide opportunities for students to shadow medical experts and conduct research in the field as well.
“It’s really an attempt to improve the undergraduate experience for people who are interested in health care careers,” said Carmen Puliafito, dean of the Keck School of Medicine. “The thing that’s really important is that they’re going to have a wider access to health care delivery experiences … We’re going to hook them up with faculty members at the medical school.”
Pre-health has long been a popular track in the College. In the fall, 850 of the 2,700 first-year students in the College registered with the pre-health designation. Quick said he estimates that about one-third of students at the College are considering a career in the medical profession.
“From my perspective, we have an amazing group of undergraduates who have an interest in pre-health,” Quick said. “We’re not doing them a service that they deserve if we’re not doing all we can for them.”
Though the details of the program have yet to be decided, the goal is to offer advising that provides pre-health students the tools they need to choose a career path and successfully apply to medical school. This includes counseling students on navigating the application process and pairing them with experts to help them through the process, Puliafito said.
As part of the beginning stages of the program, the College is searching for a director to head the pre-health advising initiative.
“This is a very important job, the director will report directly to the dean of the College,” Quick said.
Quick said the College hopes to hire a director this semester and have the program in full swing by next fall.
The program is a much-needed addition to the College’s advisement offerings, according to Ronica Patel, a junior majoring in biology and health promotion and disease prevention who plans to go to medical school.
Patel said she feels the advising at the College has been more general and not personalized to cater to her pre-health major’s needs. She said, however, that she plans to utilize the new advising for her remaining time at USC and when applying to medical school.
“I wish they did have it earlier because I’m a junior now,” Patel said. “It’s difficult to find internships in [the medical field], so that would have been a great program.”

Working at a top-tier research university can be a stressful job, but now faculty and staff members at USC have a chance to relieve that stress by visiting the Stress Reduction Lab at the USC Center for Work and Family Life.
The Center for Work and Family Life strives to help faculty and staff members successfully balance their work and personal lives, and the Stress Reduction Lab is their newest method of helping to create that balance.
The Stress Reduction Lab features a program called emWave, which uses a type of biofeedback technology that measures heart rate through a finger or ear clip sensor plugged into a computer. That heart rate measurement gives a sense of how relaxed or stressed a person is.
“It gives feedback on how your body is doing; the real value of it is that you learn specific techniques from what feedback tells you,” said Jason Sackett, employee assistance professional at the Center for Work and Family Life. “It trains you to learn how to better use stress reduction techniques.”
The program itself does not reduce stress but rather gives the user feedback — based on their heart rate — on how to have more effective stress reduction techniques.
A member of the center’s staff tracks the participant’s heart rate through various stress reduction activities, such as deep breathing or meditation, and helps the participant determine which method is most effective.
First-time participants can go to the Stress Reduction Lab for introductory sessions, where an employee will provide tutorials to help the participant get comfortable with the program and find effective stress reduction techniques. After that, users can guide themselves through the program if they feel they have mastered the technique.
Sackett said the program can be used both as a stress reliever and as a preventative measure.
“One of the values of the program is that you don’t have to have stress to benefit, and it can actually be used to prevent stress from oncoming in the first place,” Sackett said.
The idea of a Stress Reduction Lab arose during the summer, when the center initially started working with emWave, Sackett said. The center wanted to develop a proactive program available to anyone looking to improve their stress reduction strategies.
“We wanted to offer something that is more universally accepted,” Sackett said. “People have resistance to going to counseling programs, so we wanted to offer another program in which people don’t have to deal with the resistance.”
The center officially launched the emWave program in November and began advertising it to faculty and staff members this month.
So far, Sackett said he has helped an average of six people a week and other members of the centers staff have also helped staff members.
Some faculty members, though they have not tried the program yet, said it was something they might do.
“I’ve never tried it but it sounds like something I would consider,” said Felipe Martinez, assistant director of Norman Topping Student Aid Fund. “It’s important to be able to achieve work/life balance, so something that will help manage stress is very beneficial.”
Chris Mattson, director of the Structured Curriculum Program, said he thinks using the emWave could be beneficial.
“It seems interesting — anything to help relieve stress is a good thing, especially when it doesn’t cause more stress,” Mattson said.
USC currently operates two emWave programs at the USC University Park Campus, one at the USC Health Sciences Campus and one portable emWave. Sackett said that if the program seems to show improvement among the users — and it has so far — the Center will purchase more emWave programs.
“We had the idea to expand wellness services at USC, and we saw this as just another way to preserve wellness,” Sackett said.
Really great steps taken by USC for worker. Stress Reduction Lab helps them to reduce their stress in good manner. I want to suggest some extra and simple tips to reduce stress such as humor, relaxed walking, listen music, enough sleep, eat healthy and good nutrition will also useful to reduce stress.

At some schools, it’s possible to get a 4.0 GPA without ever setting foot in the classroom, but USC, defying the national trend, says it has no intention of letting students get by without going to class.
Logging on · A student accesses the online components of his course via Blackboard. Many classes supplement lectures with online segments. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
More than one in four students at colleges and universities in the United States take at least one class online, according to a recent study by the Sloan Consortium, a group that focuses on integrating online courses into higher education. In fall of 2008, the study showed, enrollment in online courses increased by 17 percent compared to the previous year.
The increase seems to result from both a greater availability of, and greater interest in, online courses. As schools look for ways to save money, online classes are becoming more and more common. Students are also gravitating toward online classes because they allow flexibility, giving students the chance to arrange their classes around a full- or part-time work schedule.
USC, however, appears to prefer that its undergraduates receive the full college experience.
According to Gene Bickers, vice provost for the Office of Undergraduate Programs, the university rarely offers undergraduate courses only online and will not be increasing the frequency of this practice.
“The philosophy behind it is that face-to-face learning is the best, particularly with undergraduates,” Bickers said. “It’s more the experience.”
The university does offer quite a few classes that are blended — a mix of lectures, discussion sections and online content — and more and more professors are using that option, Bickers said.
One of those professors is Matthew Pratt, who taught Chemistry 203 alongside Professor Richard Brutchey last fall. The class showcased online technology through a website, recording video lectures and online labs.
Though students had the option of going to all the lectures and finishing their lab assignments in the discussion section, they also had the opportunity to do it all on their own time, Pratt said.
The students that performed best, however, were those who utilized both options.
“The people that got the best grades in the class were people that I recognized every day,” Pratt said. “There’s a difference between being in class where you can stop me if you don’t understand what I’m saying and at home where you don’t have that opportunity.”
The possibility of watching a lecture at one’s own leisure can be desirable to students with other commitments, especially those forced to work full- or part-time jobs in these hard economic times, said Susan Metros, associate vice provost for Technology Enhanced Learning.
“Students have to work and to be able to take classes anytime, anywhere,” said Metros.
On the other hand, she said, it’s not USC’s mission to provide fully online degrees.
“A big part of education is the social experience, the cultural experience — you don’t get that in an online degree,” Metros said.
For Yasemin Zamanpur, a sophomore majoring in business administration, the ability to take her Core Concepts of Accounting Information (BUAD 250a) class online last semester was not as helpful as she had anticipated.
“What’s bad is that it’s very easy to lose track and, because the videos are released on a fast weekly cycle, inevitably you find that you’re left behind,” Zamanpur said.
On the other hand, the online courses offer a flexibility that’s unparalleled by face-to-face lectures.
“If you don’t understand a problem, you can pause it, rewind and look through it again,” she said. “I can watch it when I wake up in bed and on a weekend.”
For Jesse Small, a junior majoring in cinema-television critical studies who took Chemistry 203 last semester with Pratt, having the online component gave him peace of mind when he had to miss a class.
“It wasn’t more work or getting behind, but if I ever needed extra help there were the resources available,” Small said.
But having a lot of undergraduate classes offered only online doesn’t seem to be in USC’s future. Only a handful of current classes are using enough technology to make it possible to learn from home, Metros said.
“We think USC is more than just sitting in front of a screen,” she said.

USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies has created a new program that could hold national importance.
The ICT has developed an interactive program that takes participants through life like scenarios similar to those that would be encountered during wartime.
The program, known as the Mobil Counter-Improvised Explosive Device Interactive Trainer, is currently being used in training programs at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Camp Pendleton in California.
According to the ICT website, the program helps soldiers understand and prepare for the ways insurgents often utilize explosive devices. The hope is that by exposing soldiers to real life training they can learn how to avoid common mistakes that could cause serious harm.
“It’s about letting them go through various scenarios so they can be familiar with things that are likely or possible to happen without negative consequences,” said Dr. Paul Rosenbloom, a professor of computer science at the Viterbi School of Engineering. “You don’t want them to think that no matter what you’re going to do, you’re going to come out alive. They have to learn what could end up with them dead.”
Aaron Yee, a senior majoring in Public Policy who is also a member of Army ROTC, said he thinks these kinds of training methods are extremely beneficial for soldiers preparing to be deployed overseas.
“Unless you experience something like that, you’ll never know what it’s like until you’re out in the field,” Yee said.

The USC women’s tennis team earned a trip to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships after upending both of their competitors this weekend.
Doubled up · Junior Maria Sanchez captured solid victories in both  singles and doubles events during the National Team Indoor qualifier. - Amaresh Sunduran Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan 
No. 9 USC demolished the No. 35 Auburn Tigers 4-0 in a second-round matchup of the ITA Kick-off qualifiers at Marks Stadium on Saturday night. This triumph came after another 4-0 blowout by the Women of Troy on Friday against the No. 60 San Diego Toreros.
The Women of Troy improved to 4-0 on the year with the two wins.
It was relatively smooth sailing for USC as it polished off its opponents this weekend. First on Friday against San Diego, USC snagged its doubles point with two fairly quick wins and thereafter clobbered the Toreros in singles play.
The Women of Troy pocketed easy singles wins at the No. 4, 5 and 6 spots to claim the match. USC’s top-three seeded singles players were also in the lead when the match was clinched.
The next day, USC took on Auburn (which beat No. 28 LSU 4-0 on Friday) in the title match of the ITA Kick-off Weekend.
The Women of Troy were able to secure the early edge by taking the doubles point. At the No. 2 spot, freshman Danielle Lao and sophomore Alison Ramos of USC teamed up to tally in the first doubles win at 8-4.
Meanwhile at the No. 3 doubles, Auburn’s Plamena Kurteva and Paulina Schippers defeated USC’s junior Cristala Andrews and freshman Valeria Pulido 8-4. But it was only tied up for a moment, as USC’s No. 1 duo, juniors Lyndsay Kinstler and Maria Sanchez, pulled out an 8-3 win.
In singles, the Women of Troy displayed multiple occasions of stellar performances as they put the match away. Four Women of Troy opened up their singles matches with shutouts in the first set.
“It’s rare to jump out to such big leads in all of the [singles] matches,” USC coach Richard Gallien said.
To start the Women of Troy with their first singles win was nationally ranked No. 39 Ramos, who powered through her match 6-0, 6-1. USC junior Leyla Entekhabi beat her opponent in a similar fashion, 6-0, 6-1 at the No. 5 slot.
Up 3-0, the Women of Troy only needed one more singles victory to seal the deal.
In both singles matches, USC’s No. 8 Sanchez and No. 37 Pulido were neck and neck in closing out their respective opponents, as No. 18 Lao and Andrews were also nearing victory.
But it was Pulido who claimed the clincher point first, disposing of her opponent 6-0, 6-4, after coming back from trailing 1-4 in the second set to Auburn’s Daniela Vukadinovic. This left the remaining matches suspended with the remaining Trojans near victory.
This was the only scheduled match for the Women of Troy that was against an East Coast team.
“We played extremely well against such a tough Southeastern conference opponent, especially in singles,” Gallien added.
The Auburn matchup also began over an hour late because the LSU vs. San Diego consolation match ran long. The Women of Troy, used to playing in the daytime, had to play in unusual circumstances, 40-degree weather from 6:45 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
“We’re not used to playing so late in the evening so I liked the way the girls handled the adversity,” Gallien said.
But in the end, whether it be nighttime or daytime, the Women of Troy proved they can handle any kind of condition.
These two weekend wins secured a place for USC in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships set for Feb. 12-15 at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisc. Before making that trip, however, USC will stay at Marks Stadium to host Pepperdine on Thursday at 1:30 p.m.

A season of living on the edge finally caught up to the USC women’s basketball team.
USC (13-7, 7-2), which has made a habit of coming back from second-half deficits, ran into one it could not overcome Saturday against Oregon. The Ducks (13-8, 4-5) opened up a 15-point lead in the second half before cruising to victory 85-77.
Double-double· Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath had a career-high 12 rebounds to go along with her 18 points in USC’s 85-77 loss. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Women of Troy and dropped them into a tie with UCLA for second place in the conference.
“I thought we did well in the first to hold them to 38 points and we were right there in the game,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We just didn’t do it well enough in the second half.”
USC trailed the Ducks 38-35 at halftime after a back-and-forth first half that saw 13 lead changes. The Women of Troy held Oregon ­— which entered the game leading the nation in scoring at over 86 points per game — to just 36 percent shooting in the half.
The second half was a different story, however, as the Ducks ramped up their defensive pressure and started hitting shots. Oregon scored 47 points and shot nearly 50 percent from the field.
“Our defense kind of collapsed a little bit [in the second] half,” Cooper said. “It could have been because of fatigue.”
Relentless pressure defense from Oregon turned the game into a track meet and wore down the Women of Troy. USC shot just 32 percent from the field in the second half.
“It’s not anything where they want to necessarily get steals, they just want to get you to play at a faster tempo than you want to,” Cooper said.
Junior center Kari LaPlante said Oregon’s defense got the Women of Troy playing too fast and away from their game plan. USC turned the ball over 18 times in the game.
The Women of Troy got solid contributions from several players but were unable to keep pace with Oregon, which got outstanding games from senior guards Taylor Lilley and Micaela Cocks. Cocks scored 24 points but was overshadowed by her backcourt mate, who put on a shooting clinic at the Galen Center.
Lilley knocked down a school-record nine 3-pointers en route to a career-best 36 points. The diminutive guard repeatedly got free from larger defenders for wide-open shots from beyond the arc.
“We know she can shoot very deep,” LaPlante said. “We’re used to putting our heels on that 3-point line, but she’s way farther back and she’s just launching them.”
Lilley entered the day fifth in 3-pointers made in Pac-10 history with 146 3-pointers.
LaPlante and sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath led the way for the Women of Troy. Gilbreath turned in another strong all-around performance with 18 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and four blocks. LaPlante had perhaps her best game of the season with a career-high 18 points and a game-high 15 rebounds.
Sophomore guard Ashley Corral paced USC with 22 points but shot just 7 of 20 from the field and failed to record an assist. Corral came into the game leading the conference in assists with over five per game.
USC looks to rebound this week with road games against California and No. 2 Stanford.

There are a lot of things wrong with the world.
A lot of things.
The list is just about endless. The country of Haiti is in dire straits after a devastating earthquake. The American economy is stuck in a prolonged rough patch. Unimaginable suffering continues in countries like Burma and Sudan. 
But, at the risk of trivializing those wrongs in the world, here’s one thing that’s right: Stafon Johnson coming back to play in Saturday’s Senior Bowl.
Johnson, a former USC running back, ran the ball in his first appearance since a horrific accident in late September. He gained just three yards on four carries Saturday, but, honestly, it doesn’t matter.
Because the fact that he managed to come back — the fact that he managed to play a game of football just 124 days after he nearly died and crushed his neck and larynx — is so ridiculously inspirational in itself.
And the reason he came back so quickly?
Well, he faced adversity and embraced it.
He let it run its course and then he spun it on its head.
Basically, he just believed — even when few did.
“I knew I would come back,” Johnson told the Orlando Sentinel from Mobile, Ala., where he impressed NFL scouts all week in Senior Bowl practices. “I just didn’t know when it would be. Three years from now? Two years from now? I just knew I wasn’t going to give up.”
Altogether, Johnson’s story would make for a pretty good Hollywood script.
I can see it now: 21-year-old football player near the peak of his athletic prowess suffers a tragic injury and survives because he was “abnormally muscular.”
Doctors forecast he likely won’t be able to talk again, and the idea of ever playing football is forgotten in the fight to survive.
Life goes on, though, and people forget about him a little bit.
Two months later, said football player gives a dramatic, emotional news conference and says his first public words since the accident. He quotes his late grandfather in a goosebump-inspiring raspy whisper.
“God has a plan,” he says.
And boy, someone sure has a plan — or a script, at least.
Because nobody — save for Johnson himself, of course — could have thought he would come back this soon. Cliché, maybe. But his doctor said in November that it was a miracle caused by Johnson’s undyingly positive attitude.
Nobody thought he would take little more than the rest of the season to recover.
And nobody thought he would come back perhaps stronger than ever before.
In Mobile, Johnson weighed in at a prototypical 214 pounds on his 5-foot-11 frame — heavier than he had ever weighed as a Trojan.
He looked shifty. He looked tough. He looked, well — “he didn’t look tentative at all,” as an anonymous NFL coach told the Los Angeles Times this week.
And he sure as hell looked excited.
“It’s wonderful to come here and play against some of the great guys in the country,” Johnson said in an interview during the game. “It’s awesome. I was more anxious than nervous to be here. I’m a football player. I’ve been playing all my life. I’m just happy to be here.”
And that’s Johnson for you. In a column that ran the Wednesday after his injury last September, I wrote: “He’s just a happy person.”
He is.
But he had one more quality that was more important than all of these.
He might have been abnormally muscular. He might have been abnormally strong-willed. He might have been abnormally happy for no reason.
But the most important thing — the reason he stands to be drafted in April and has a good shot at succeeding in the NFL — is he was confident.
Confident in God when others would have doubted.
Confident in doctors when there was every reason to be skeptical.
Confident in himself when few others were.
And that confidence can be applied to a lot of things in the world.
It’s not going to solve the world’s problems, and it’s not the solution to everything by any means. But simple confidence in one’s future — with God or not — is an important factor to recovery.
And one that’s often forgotten.

Two road games and a pair of hungry Oregon schools proved to be a deadly combination for the Trojans.
Not enough · Senior guard Dwight Lewis, pictured here against UC Riverside, hit a game-tying layup in the second half of the Trojans’ loss to Oregon on Saturday, but the Ducks scored 15 of the next 17 points to open up a lead they would not look back from. Lewis finished with 16 points. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Less than 48 hours after a 51-45 defeat at Oregon State, the USC men’s basketball team traveled some 50 miles south to take on the Oregon Ducks. But much like they  faded in the second half against the Beavers, the Trojans (12-9, 4-5) ran into a wall in the final minutes of the game and never recovered in a 67-57 loss Saturday at McArthur Court.
With just under six minutes left to play, senior guard Dwight Lewis stole the ball and took it the other way for a layup, tying the score at 47. Oregon answered with a 15-2 run, leaving the Trojans reeling and unable to mount a comeback.
Following a driving layup by Oregon guard Tajuan Porter that gave the home team a 49-47 advantage, a technical foul was called on USC’s bench, abruptly halting all momentum for the Trojans. While it was initially unclear why the call was made, USC coach Kevin O’Neill later said an official told him that Stan Holt, a student manager, prompted the whistle.
“It was our manager who got the technical foul for screaming obscenities at the referee,” O’Neill said. “We were on a roll, and then the technical turned into a four-point score for them.”
Porter drained both of the ensuing free throws, and the Ducks pulled away from there, putting up 16 points in the final 4:25. Redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity made a 3-pointer with 1:30 left to cut the deficit to seven, but by then it was too late.
Against an uncharacteristically lenient USC defense, Oregon (12-9, 4-5) shot 50 percent from the field, including 6 of 12 from behind the 3-point line. Redshirt sophomore forward Jeremy Jacob harassed the Trojans with a career-high 19 points, and sophomore guard Malcolm Armstead added 18 points for the Ducks.
USC converted just 41 percent of its shot attempts, going cold late in the second half as Oregon charged ahead. Senior guard Dwight Lewis hit three 3-pointers on his way to 16 points and Gerrity had 12 points and five assists, but it wasn’t enough to keep the Trojans from falling to 1-6 on the road this season.
“We’re not a great road team and didn’t shoot the ball well,” O’Neill said. “We just don’t shoot well from outside. We just struggled with everything today.”
The Trojans’ shooting woes were most apparent at the free-throw line, where they made just 5 of 11 attempts. Oregon went 15 of 19.
A lack of production from two key starters also hurt USC. Redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson finished with just five points despite playing nearly the entire game, while redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson was held scoreless.
After a sluggish start to the game, the Trojans started to close near the end of the first half, with Gerrity scoring six straight points to shave the Ducks’ lead to 31-28 going into the break.
But Oregon never let up. Josh Crittle’s fallaway jumper with 11:10 left made it 45-36. Even after USC rallied back with an 11-2 run, the Ducks proved to have an answer, out-executing and outshooting the Trojans down the stretch.
Since sweeping the Arizona schools in its first two Pac-10 games, USC has cooled off considerably, dropping five of its last seven contests and three of its last four. The Trojans’ only road victory of the season came in a 67-46 blowout of UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, a 20-minute drive from the USC campus.

From behind, wild cackling erupts from the depths of someone’s throat. To the left, gangly arms flail about hoping to catch fleeting attention. Screams, loud noises and laughter give the room an air of madness.
No, you’re not in a zoo. You’re in a classroom in City University London the sixth most popular university in the United Kingdom for new student applications. Despite the raucous classroom scene, City University — located in the borough of Islington — takes pride in pumping out highly qualified and employable graduates. 
With more than 23,000 students, the university enrolls an extremely diverse student body, having more than 40 percent of its students as international applicants, which is more than any other school in the United Kingdom.
Maybe that’s why when I looked around the unruly classroom on my first day as one of those international students, I saw others from a wide variety of backgrounds dozing off, chatting with their neighbors during lecture and arguing with the professor about test fairness.
A girl wearing brown polka dots loudly told her friends about her sexual conquests from the previous weekend. A boy complained about having to attend mandatory discussions. It took a few minutes, but the flustered professor finally told the class to “shut up,” asking us to stop contesting her syllabus.
Although this debacle was the exception to how most of my other classes proceeded, it reflected the lax and seemingly disorganized approach, in general, to education in the United Kingdom.
There are many differences between pursuing higher education in the United States and in England. Firstly, people pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the United Kingdom attend school for only three years. Like in the United States, they study everything from medicine and economics to music and design.
Instead of majoring in English, however, students “read” in a subject. Instead of buying books, the majority of people borrow them from the library. Participating in lecture is actually frowned upon, deferring student feedback to tutorials and clinics, which are similar to USC’s discussion sections.
Even grading scales reflect the somber attitude toward learning. Typically, a grade of 40 percent or better passes a class, while a grade of 70 percent can be considered an A.
Dr. Julia McDonald, study abroad manager at City University, compares taking a class in the United Kingdom to the high jump — succeeding requires gradually working your way up to the end of the line and then taking the final leap.
Instead of overcoming regular short-term hurdles, where assignments are due every few weeks and midterms gauge your progress, U.K. students usually only have one or two papers and a final exam with no other system of accountability in place.
In my international politics class, 30 percent of my grade is based on one essay. The other 70 percent comes from the final. Attendance and participation are not taken into consideration at all. Requirements place more emphasis on studying on your own time than attending lecture. As a result, students must be more proactive in keeping up with the coursework.
Theoretically, I could skip classes, turn in one paper and show up on the last day to take the test. As nice as that sounds however, the only loser in that situation would be me.
Because the system rewards self-discipline and encourages individual effort, classes meet fewer times a week and offer a more flexible structure conducive to independent study. It also, however, makes it a lot more tempting to slack off until the end and fail a class.
Although the lenient approaches to student interaction could easily breed a disconnect between students and teachers, the opposite is true.
The administration is able to guarantee a spot for all students in every class, professors know most students by name and, most importantly, they encourage personal growth.
It felt exhilarating to show up to a class unregistered, knowing that I would have a place in it. I didn’t have to worry about the best way to coax the professor into signing my add/drop form or even about being stuck in a class I didn’t like.
I didn’t have to wade through an endless throng of students to get to the reception desk, only to have to make an appointment. I strolled into my advisor’s office and was immediately able to speak with a friendly woman who already knew me by name after only a brief encounter. The biggest difficulty I encountered was finding the room.
Despite all the of the differences between higher education policy in the United States and Britain, studies show that students in the United Kingdom have a greater chance of being employed full time six months after graduation than those in the United States.
To the wily American student used to rigid structures, the U.K. education system may seem confusing and in disarray, but within the chaos is a process with proven results.

After two years of closure, Los Angeles’ infamous Doughboys Cafe has finally reopened.
Soup du jour · Doughboys Cafe returns to Los Angeles with its original menu and recipes intact. Since reopening Jan. 13, visitors have enjoyed offerings including the popular French Onion soup (above). - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
First established in 1992, this little bakery-turned-restaurant on Third Street stirred up quite a hype with its famous red velvet cake and all-day breakfasts with huge portions at reasonable prices.
Unfortunately, it was also infamous for health violations and, after closing, rumors flew around about food poisoning and cockroach infestations. Although the restaurant’s new owner addresses these rumors as false on the Doughboys website, the local staple remained closed, leaving Los Angeles foodies helpless.
But now the little café that could is back — with new management, a new look and the same great menu that made it famous.
The days of cockroach infestation rumors are behind Doughboys and the location’s new look provides relief for those who are at all concerned. The interior is bright, clean and trendy with soft, warm colors and natural sunlight flowing through the street-side wall of windows.
The place was packed with customers, despite it being late in the afternoon, granting extra comfort in the fact that if you get food poisoning, at least you won’t be the only one.
Doughboys Cafe has an extensive menu, full of unique and diverse choices.
With fascinating pancake options, such as Rice Krispy and pineapple or coconut and macadamia nut, and an enormous sandwich called the Monster — as the menu says, “you eat it like a big taco” — every choice description is drool-worthy. And between Dougboys’ sweet breakfast items and savory lunch options, the only problem is deciding what to try first.
The servers are not much help in providing advice, though. “Everything is good,” one insisted. “You can’t go wrong with anything,” said another. And perhaps they are right.
No matter what comes out of the kitchen, it’s sure to provide a pleasant gastronomical experience and for a reasonable price too. Food here is cheap, even by L.A. standards. Most dishes are under $10, and portions are big enough to make a leftover snack.
The Red Fennel Hash — a breakfast dish of grilled, braised beef, sweet potato, onions and roasted red beets — comes topped with two griddle-fried eggs, green onions and cheddar-crusted focaccia with gravy on the side.
It is certainly not your average hash breakfast. A big mound of red, orange and gold from the savory nectar of the runny yolks covers the entire dish and it’s altogether smoky, slightly sweet and delicious. The focaccia bread around it is chewy and perfect for mopping up the leftover grease and juices.
The Grilled Tuna Melt comes as a thick slather of hot tuna salad and cheddar cheese between two buttered slices of toasted sourdough bread. The tuna salad is made from solid white tuna, a tiny bit of diced red onions, enough mayonnaise to bind them together and nothing else. It definitely packs enough tuna for your buck and is perfectly creamy, cheesy and hot.
The French Onion soup is a divine revelation of what real soup should taste like. Heated to order, it comes steaming in a ceramic bowl, topped with garlic-butter toast and melted Swiss cheese. The broth is flavorful, chock-full of caramelized onions, and the size of a bowl portion makes a meal in itself.
Meanwhile, the Soup au Pistou is the antonym of the French Onion. Instead of a greasy and cheesy mess, it is a light, tomato-based soup made from fresh vegetables and topped with a dollop of homemade basil pesto. It comes served with grilled French bread and makes for a light yet satisfying meal for the more health-conscious customer.
This being Third Street, however, parking is horrible. Doughboys has neither valet parking or its own parking area, so, if you bring your own car, you are left on your own to find a parking spot. This might sound like a hassle, but the food makes it all worth it.
Whether you are looking for a fresh, healthy meal or a greasy, finger-licking hangover dish, Doughboys has it all. By the time you’ve taken your last bite, you will have forgetten all the gossip about vermin problems and health inspection failures.
Doughboys, welcome back.

A life size statue of a man — arms crossed — stands at the top of a red velvet staircase. His toned, golden body overlooks posters from some of the greatest films in history. Depicting timeless classics and their worthy competitors, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences’ display of 80 best picture nominee posters comes at a time when the Academy’s decision to nominate 10 films for this year’s best picture category has everyone talking. 
Having 10 films on the ballot instead of only five might seem weird in today’s context, but it’s not unprecedented. The Academy has done this before — for eight years in a row.
“The More the Merrier” exhibit in Beverly Hills is proof that the Academy is no stranger to having 10 best picture nominees. To ease this generation’s movie fans into the long-standing concept, the exhibit contains rare posters of the 10 best picture nominees from the years 1936 to 1943. The posters include releases from around the world and range in shape, size and technique. The posters not only represent the nominees but also showcase some of the best and most underrated art of the ’30s and ’40s.
“The pinnacle of movie poster collecting is finding a great poster for a great film” said Mike Kaplan, who owns the majority of the collection. “There are a lot of good posters for bad movies.”
The exhibit is a glimpse of a time that many of us will never know — when film was the major form of media. It shows the actors and actresses who live the lives of Hollywood royalty. Stars such as Deanna Derban, Clark Gable, John Wayne and Bette Davis are eternally captured in promotional items for the movies that made them famous. The time period these posters come from marks the height of Hollywood glamor and represents a lifestyle that stars today still strive to recreate.
This Golden Age of Hollywood is alive and well in the exhibit room. The red carpets, dim lighting and large crowd of eager viewers matches the hype that surrounded the release of each one of the films represented. With the lights focused on each individual masterpiece, it isn’t hard to see why Kaplan has a passion for collecting posters from this period.
“The design element is what attracts me to the poster — the illustrated point of view,” Kaplan said.
Out of the 80 pieces that are on display, Kaplan provided 76 of them from his personal accumulation. The Academy was able to find the last four and complete his unique collection for the exhibit.
Once the Oscar-detailed front doors to the exhibit building open, visitors are greeted by a The More the Merrier (1943) poster. A gorgeous blonde actress and seven other smiling women tucked into a bed provide a warming beginning to the cinematic tour. Kaplan said he chose this image as the opening poster — and exhibit’s namesake — because it had a beautiful use of color and design.
“The More the Merrier poster also has eight ladies, and the number of years in the exhibit is eight, so it seemed like the best representation,” Kaplan said.
On the next wall, the age-old love story of Romeo and Juliet (1936) is captured in the form of a vibrant three-sheet restored poster. This particular poster uses dramatic colors and large paintings of both characters to draw the viewer’s attention.
“It’s a jaw dropper,” Kaplan said.
One reason the posters from this period can be seen as works of art is that studios were very independent then, employing their own designers and artists for all their posters.
“[Warner Brothers] is one of my favorites,” Kaplan said. “They used very elegant art deco styles that are compelling and dramatic.”
On the other hand, 20th Century Fox put the themes of each of their films into its posters with the essence of each film and the main scenes accurately portrayed in every image.
The posters hang on every surface of the large exhibition room and lobby, with no pillar or wall spared. But, like the movies they introduce, each poster is unique and tells a different story. For example, during the ’30s and ’40s, most studios used elaborate trade ads to sell their films, while others used only a hint of color and details.
Films such as The Little Foxes (1941) used its female lead (Bette Davis) to advertise their movies. At a time when colored film was just coming into existence, color was key to promoting films. And most of the posters that are on display demonstrate that with a wide variety of colors mixed together to create eye-catching scenes.
An original painting of a scene from Gone with the Wind (1939) is paired with the film’s poster, showing the talent and time that went into each one of these promotional tools. The detailed portraits of Rhett Butler and Scarlet O’Hara bring home the power and passion of the film.
The Wizard of Oz (1939) uses bright primary colors with tiny characters woven into the title’s words in order to catch the attention of both children and adults. The original movie poster for this American childhood classic shows a distorted yet fascinating perspective of the movie.
With the Oscars inching closer, “The More The Merrier” showcases some of the best films to grace Hollywood. Perhaps one of this year’s 10 best picture nominees will make a worthy addition to Kaplan’s collection someday, but one must only see the blazing sunset of Gone with the Wind or the icy gaze of The Little Foxes’ Bette Davis to know these films are a hard act to follow. Regardless, both movie buffs and art lovers can experience a glimpse of a beautiful past with “The More the Merrier.”

It has not been an auspicious week for American space travel.
The California State Historical Resources Commission voted last week to officially commemorate more than 100 items of space junk, a list that includes two urine collection devices and four motion sickness receptacles (known affectionately as barf bags by those who frequent Disneyland’s Tower of Terror).
The historical scent of galactic bodily fluids had barely cleared from the air when newspapers across the country began reporting that President Barack Obama is planning to place a moratorium on space travel to the moon and Mars, and instead place the burden of exploration on private companies.
The New York Times reported Thursday that the budget Obama will unveil to Congress this week will allocate $100 billion to NASA over the next four years; the majority of the money will go to private companies to provide shuttles to the International Space Station. The two capsules NASA has already spent billions of dollars engineering will be retired.
The implications of the plan raise serious questions about NASA’s place in the future of space travel, a field it once proudly held a vice-grip on.
The shelving of the two space shuttles will cut at least a third of the 15,000 jobs at Kennedy Space Center according to the New York Times, a number only slightly offset by the estimated 1,700 jobs outsourced launchings could create in Florida.
Obama’s budget will also effectively sound the death knell for the Constellation program, NASA’s five-year-old initiative to develop spacecrafts that would return astronauts to the moon and perhaps even chart a manned mission to Mars. The program’s two figurehead capsules, the Ares I and the Orion, have already cost NASA $9 billion — an amount large enough to question the rationale of Obama’s budget.
Outsourcing the construction of space shuttles away from NASA’s 50-plus years of experience is risky business; no private company has the equivalent know-how or knowledge of safety protocol, and, with space travel still an infant field, safety is paramount.
The budget leaves little wiggle room for scientific advancement. The Orlando Sentinel, the first periodical to report the forthcoming budget changes, did quote White House officials as saying NASA will eventually be tasked with developing “heavy-lift” rockets that will explore beyond Earth’s orbit — but this will probably not come to fruition for decades.
There can be no denying that outer space is not at the forefront of the administration’s focus; in its slow rebound from economic recession, the United States has much to battle without leaving the atmosphere. Under the planned budget, NASA will be utilized to combat problems closer to home, most significantly climate change.
Yet, despite economic woes, it’s hard not to see Obama’s budget as the end of an era for American space travel. Terrestrial technology is growing with leaps and bounds, as new, ill-named gadgets are announced with the pomp and circumstance of rocket launchings.
The frontier that once seemed conquerable is now receding from America’s focus. The United States has given NASA the backseat in the space race in favor of entrepreneurship. It may be a small step forward for commercial companies, but it’s a giant leap backward for American space travel.

Nice article. Maybe Obama will understand when China starts going to the moon.

A war has been waged on monogamy. Polyamorists, people who engage in consensual romantic love with multiple partners, are going around suggesting that the “soul mate” is no more real than Santa Claus.
The increasingly publicized, nontraditional lifestyle is finally “creeping out of the closet, making gay marriage feel somewhat last decade,” according to a Jan. 3 article in the Boston Globe Sunday Magazine. 
If we don’t fight back soon, the whole world is going to start engaging in uninhibited, promiscuous sexual intercourse, the foundations of society will crumble and the entire human race will die from some terrible, genitally transmitted malady — at least that’s what director of the Center for Research on Marriage and Religion Patrick Fagan seems to think.
“The polyamorists ‘snatch’ children away from their parents and from the culture of monogamy just as the Ottoman Turks of the 14th century raided boys from Christian nations to train them as their own elite warriors, the Jannissaries,” he wrote in this month’s issue of Touchstone Magazine.
But maybe polyamory is not the force of evil Fagan suggests it is.
According to evolutionary theory, humans developed monogamous tendencies because infants are totally helpless at birth — unlike baby chicks, which can survive on their own immediately after hatching. Throughout our evolutionary history, infants were less likely to survive without the protection of both a mother and a father. Thus, natural selection favors an inclination to form monogamous relationships.
But we no longer have to worry that wolves might eat our children if we leave them behind to grab some dinner. The core reason for which we developed the inclination to commit seems to have become irrelevant.
Is it possible that the growing polyamorous community, infidelities like Tiger Woods’ and John Edwards’, and the skyrocketing divorce rate are only natural consequences of monogamy’s decreased importance for survival? Some people argue that monogamy no longer serves any purpose and is merely a denial of our naturally fleeting sexual appetites.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Evolutionary theory suggests that in a species with a highly competitive sexual environment, individuals with the greatest sperm count — i.e., the largest testes — are more likely to pass on their genes. Sexually promiscuous chimpanzees, for example, have very large testes. On the other hand, gorillas have never faced that type of competition. They have always tended to mate for life, so they evolved small testes.
Human testes size lies somewhere in the middle because of our mixture of monogamous and polygamous inclinations. Evolutionary theorists often attribute the prevalence of serial monogamy to this paradox.
Polyamorists choose to resolve our conflicting inclinations by having multiple committed relationships. Thus, they embrace both the natural human desire to commit and the innate human instinct to copulate with more than one person.
One polyamorist in a Boston Globe article explained that she chose the lifestyle for “the freedom to engage in relationships that are not about life partnerships but may provide different perspectives, adventures in sexuality and new connections with many people.”
Other factors seem to point to a natural human promiscuity. Bodily dimorphism, the fact that human males are generally larger and heavier than human females, seems to support the idea of comparatively high sexual competition as well.
But even if monogamy really has stopped being necessary for survival, and we do have an inherently promiscuous nature, is polyamory really the answer? Most people who choose to commit to one person acknowledge that they don’t just magically stop desiring other people. It takes discipline and restraint that pays off in other ways.
Polyamorists must also discipline and restrain themselves. They must suppress their feelings of jealousy and possessiveness, just as monogamists must suppress their unfaithful sexual urges. So really, it’s not like polyamorists more fully embrace human nature than monogamists do.
Jealousy is just as innate as our fickle sexual instincts. Nature selected in favor of humans with possessive emotions. For women, jealousy helps secure a man’s help in fathering their children. For men, it helps them ascertain that it is their sperm that impregnates a woman, not anybody else’s.
Surely polyamorists have as tough of a time trying to transcend their innate feelings of jealousy and possessiveness as monogamists do trying to transcend inclinations toward promiscuity.
Our nature is divided. No matter what lifestyle we choose, it’s going to be difficult. Is one endeavor really more noble, natural or reasonable than the other?
Jean Guerrero is a senior majoring in print journalism. Her column “Scientastical” runs Mondays.
Serial monogamy rules the day. That alone should tell the world that the polyamorist types are onto something.
I know very few people who have only had 1 partner. Monogamy just doesn’t cut it for most people.
Well, since you are basing your entire thought process on “evolutionary theory,” you are failing to take into consideration the vast numbers of people who do not base their behavior on that particular unproven theory. What if — we are created beings with souls, unlike our animal friends? What if being human makes us unique, set apart? Wrap your brain around that possibility. Maybe it suits us better to not act like monkeys in our mating behavior. Most individuals who have acted that way find that it is no path to a richer, fuller life. We teach our children to show that self-control for a reason. It’s because at a young age (college age included) we are more inclined to want to follow our emotions and urges. That’s not really the way to go through life, however. And it can and does have terrible consequences for many individuals — one might even argue, especially females. Sex is so much more than just an urge, like needing to urinate. It’s a complex emotional process that involves the whole person. Treating it the way the animals do demeans us all.

J.D. Salinger, the reclusive writer of the quintessential coming-of-age-but-bitter-about-it novel Catcher In The Rye, passed away Wednesday in his New England home. The writer has been notoriously guarded since the publication of his last work in 1965, refusing interviews at every turn and declining to be in the public eye whenever possible. Salinger’s distaste for attention is echoed in the behavior of his most memorable character, Holden Caulfield from Catcher In The Rye. That work, in which “phony” was introduced to the cultural vernacular and adolescent angst was made indefinitely fashionable, will likely stand as Salinger’s greatest and most lasting contribution to the American literary canon.
All propriety aside, readers may stand to benefit from the late author’s passing in that some works — previously unreleased at the Salinger’s discretion — may be published posthumously. Should publisher’s elect to disrespect what were probably the deceased’s most dearly held wishes to keep his writings from the public, you can probably look for an anthology of new works by the year’s end.
