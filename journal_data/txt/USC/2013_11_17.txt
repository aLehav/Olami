USC researchers have discovered a new, relatively nontoxic solvent that can be used to make thin films of material that can dissolve semiconductors, an important component in solar panel technology.
Solid semiconductors are the basis of many electronics. A specific class of semiconductors, known as chalcogenides, are especially crucial in solar panels that can generate electricity and flexible electronics.
Richard Brutchey, associate professor of chemistry, and David Webber, postdoctoral chemistry researcher, created a mixture composed of 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine that could break down the solid structure of chalcogenide semiconductors. In addition, the nine total compounds that the solvent broke down and dissolved could be recovered from the solution as a thin film of semiconductor simply by evaporating the solvent out.
The solvent, nicknamed “alkahest” after a universal solvent alchemists thought existed, is a step up from the toxic hydrazine now used to make high-quality semiconductor films. Hydrazine is an explosive and carcinogenic compound, which makes it difficult to use commercially.
“One of the other major uses of hydrazine is [for] rocket fuel. It’s extremely toxic and explosive,” Webber said.
Webber said he identified the two compounds in the “alkahest” solvent mixture as a potentially strong solvent based on parallels with the hydrazine-based solvent system.
“I was working on nanoparticles and different mixtures to spread nanoparticles,” Webber said. “It kind of grew out of that because I came up with a system that could modify the surface of nanoparticles and it also appeared to have some ability to dissolve things so that got me thinking.”
Webber said other members of the Brutchey lab will continue working with the solvent since the lab works on similar areas of research, including solar cell applications.
“There is a lot of interest in creating cost-effective solar panels, which the new solvent can be used for,” he said.
Semiconductors can also potentially be used for flexible electronics such as computer screens.
“If you have a very thin mobile phone, if you’ve got bendy electronics and you drop it, it’s going to be basically indestructible,” Webber said.
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the National Science Foundation funded the project.

Sunday marked the 94th birthday of renowned businessman and philanthropist Gordon S. Marshall, the namesake of the USC Marshall School of Business.
In 1997, Marshall donated $35 million to the USC School of Business. At the time, it was the largest endowment ever made to a U.S. business school and the second largest donation in USC’s history.
Celebration · Anna Barbashoba, president of the Marshall Business Student Government, slices cake dedicated to Gordon S. Marshall. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The school was renamed the Gordon S. Marshall School of Business in light of his donation.
A Los Angeles native, Marshall attended the university in the early 1940s, graduating in 1946 with a bachelor’s degree from what was then the USC College of Commerce. During college, he served as a bomber pilot in World War II.
“Gordon had an exceptional experience here at USC,” said James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business and close friend of Marshall’s. “He loved it, he loved every minute of it, and it was just a great part of his life.”
Following his time at USC, Marshall sought a career as an airline pilot. He failed the aptitude test, however, which stated that he was better suited for a career in business.
“[The airline] said I should be an executive and a salesman. I said, ‘A salesman? That’s the last thing in the world I want to be,’” Marshall said in a video released by USC honoring the philanthropist’s birthday.
The aptitude test would prove correct. Marshall became a manufacturer’s representative and founded his own electronic supply distribution company, Marshall Industries, in 1954. It rose from humble beginnings into a $3 billion company, Ellis said.
“In my opinion, when you decide what you’re going to do, whatever that happens to be, try to be the best at it,” Marshall said.
Following the donation, the spotlight on the businessman grew. He was named one of the country’s top 10 leading philanthropists in Slate magazine’s 1996 list.
“I’m overwhelmed with all of this attention. I was just hoping I could give a little money to the school and go back and do my thing … I guess it’s not going to work that way,” Marshall told the Los Angeles Times.
In the video, Marshall spoke of the extreme honor he had in being able to contribute to and be a part of the university.
“I feel so fortunate, I’ve been so gratified by the success that I’ve had and I’m so glad that I was in a position to do what I did for USC and give them the money for the business school,” Marshall said. “It’s a very worthwhile undertaking and I know I’ve been so grateful having had the opportunity and having fulfilled it. I couldn’t be happier.”
Marshall still stays in touch with the school that bears his name, and he and Ellis meet regularly.
“I have lunch with [Gordon Marshall] on a pretty regular basis, and talk about what we’re doing [at Marshall] and the kinds of things he does,” Ellis said.
Ellis spoke about how Marshall’s characteristics made him the perfect embodiment of the Marshall School’s values.
“He was an entrepreneur, was a philanthropist, he has very high values and standards and is the perfect guy to have the school named in his honor. His life was lived the way we would love our students to live it,” Ellis said. “He is a wonderful visionary, leader, clear thinker and truly has been a mentor to me and the many others.”

The USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy and the Sol Price School of Public Policy hosted a conversation between MSNBC host and author Chris Matthews and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday evening in Doheny Memorial Library.
Reflection · MSNBC host and author Chris Matthews and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger looked back on their experiences in politics and recommended ways to increase bipartisanship on Friday evening. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The talk focused on Matthew’s new book Tip and the Gipper: When Politics Worked about the relationship between former President Ronald Reagan and former Speaker of the House Thomas “Tip” O’Neill. In addition, the two discussed the intense partisanship that has become characteristic of national politics and stressed the need to return to the times of deal-making and compromise.
“When you go to a car dealer, for example, you don’t go there just to haggle,” Matthews said. “You haggle, but you’re there to make a deal.”
Matthews, drawing on content from his book, spoke about the close friendship between Reagan and O’Neill despite their differences in ideology, including their famous unspoken rule to not argue past 6 p.m. He said that the two “gave each other victories” and understood the need for compromise, an understanding which Matthews believes is absent from Washington today.
Matthews spoke about the sense of patriotism that led O’Neill to support Reagan’s foreign policy agenda, noting when, in 1985, Reagan sent O’Neill to Moscow to meet with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and O’Neill introduced himself as a member of the opposition.
“When Gorbachev asked O’Neill what it meant to be a part of the opposition he said, and I love this quote, ‘On some questions, we don’t agree on everything,’” Matthews said.
Schwarzenegger spoke about his efforts during his tenure as governor to cross party lines and achieve political reform despite opposition from both parties. He said his goal in creating his administration was to pick the best people regardless of party affiliation and talked about his decision to appoint a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his chief of staff, a move that was unpopular with the Republican Party. He recalled a meeting with Republican Party officials at a hotel near the capitol building during which they asked him to replace Kennedy.
“I looked around and said, ‘Did somebody rewrite the rules? Because last I checked the governor made appointments, not the party,’” Schwarzenegger said.
He spoke about the legislative feats he was able to accomplish with Democratic support including strong environmental protections and health care reform.
“During my administration, we didn’t care about whether something was a Republican issue or a Democratic issue,” Schwarzenegger said. “We did it because it was good for the people.”
Both he and Matthews discussed the harms of gerrymandering that protects incumbents, and Schwarzenegger spoke about his efforts to achieve electoral reform in California, efforts that resulted in the adoption of open primaries and independent redistricting. He said that both parties were strongly against the reform and that it failed the first five times it was proposed.
“From my experience as a weight lifter, I know that you keep trying to lift a 500-pound weight until you do,” he said. “You don’t give up, and on the sixth time, we passed it.”
Both he and Matthews criticized the current Congress, noting the historically low approval ratings.
“Congress’ approval is down to 8 percent,” Schwarzenegger said. “Herpes is more popular than Congress.”
Matthews attributed the dysfunction in Washington in part to the absence of Washington social life, the decline of which began, according to Matthews, when former Speaker Newt Gingrich began encouraging freshman congressmen to keep their families in their home districts. He said the frequent socializing that used to be common among members of Congress helped increase bipartisanship.
“Everyone goes home [to their districts] on their jet planes these days,” Matthews said. “There are no buddies in Washington.”
Many students were impressed by Matthews’ and Schwarzenegger’s similar messages about bridging the gap between parties.
“I thought it was very insightful and I liked the optimism for bipartisanship,” said Nick Kosturos, a junior majoring in international relations. “I think some of the initiatives that Chris Matthews was talking about, like how congressmen should spend more time after work not going back to their home districts all the time, would be very useful.”
Most agreed that the policies Schwarzenegger and Matthews described would be beneficial.
“It was good to hear that you have to be human to survive in politics. It’s not this beast of professionalism, you really have to sit down and work things out,” said Gwen Holst, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, neuroscience and political economy.

I stopped watching his show years ago as he became more partisan than Rush Limbaugh when Bill Clinton left office. Chris’ idea of bipartisanship is the melding of Democrat and Socialist ideas with Greens and Communists.
Interesting to hear that Matthews is promoting bipartisan politics when he is one of the more caustic and devisive members of the MSNBC Obama Admin political news machine.

At least 10 people were injured at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday night during USC’s 20-17 victory over Stanford.
Five people were transported during the game and five after the game, but none of the injuries were life-threatening, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. CBS Los Angeles reported that one man sustained a possible ankle fracture.
Fans stormed onto the field after USC scored a field goal with 19 seconds left in the fourth quarter, bringing the score to 20-17. Students and fans pushed down the fence at the east end zone, USC Dept. of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle said.
Carlisle said DPS worked with the Los Angeles Police Department and Contemporary Services Corporation, a crowd management company, to keep everyone safe.
“Of course when you have thousands of people rushing the field, there’s nothing we can do to stop that,” Carlisle said. “We just try to prevent injuries.”
Carlisle said DPS was aware that the Stanford game might present safety issues and that the department tried to prepare for the possibility.
“We staff as many officers as we have available at games, and particularly at a big game like yesterday’s with a sold-out Coliseum and [it being] homecoming,” he said. “So, we knew there was going to be a large crowd.”
Daniel Avila, 63, was one of the people injured when the game ended. Avila was taken to the hospital after he was knocked down on the field. Avila is a photographer for the USC Sports Information Office, and he said he ran onto the field after the game in order to photograph the players and interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
“Somebody knocked me down and that led to a domino effect,” Avila said. “Everyone started tripping and a big pile ensued and I was the unlucky one at the bottom of it.”
Avila was transported to the hospital where his leg was X-rayed, but was found to be only badly bruised. He said he wasn’t upset about what happened, because it’s all just part of the job.
“I knew what was going to happen. As a photographer there is a risk involved in being on a field,” Avila said. “Players have run into me, knocked me over, but that’s one of the risks you take.”

Steve Kay, dean of the David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, will answer questions from the USC community posted on Twitter with the hashtag #20Qs4DeanK in honor of his one-year anniversary as dean of Dornsife.
“My one-year anniversary seemed like a perfect time to publicly reaffirm my commitment to our students and to the Trojan Family by encouraging a conversation,” Kay said. “Twitter is a perfect forum for a conversation. It’s immediate, it’s simple and it’s accessible to nearly everyone.”
Students, administrators and other members of the USC community tweeted questions to Kay from Nov. 12 through Nov. 15.
“I think that this is a really positive way for  USC administrators to show that they’re really interested in students,” said sophomore Halle Edwards-McQuilton, who is majoring in mathematics and American studies and ethnicity. “I think [Kay’s Twitter event] is a very tangible way to show [the administration’s] interest and that they’re committed to helping students and communicating with them.”
Kay plans to answer questions from his #20Qs4DeanK event beginning the week of Nov. 18, selecting 20 of them at random.
“To someone who has never met up with or seen him before, I don’t know what his image would be,” said Kenneth Tham, a senior majoring in chemical biology. “So this is a good way for him to reach out to a large group of people and show that this is his personality.”
Questions posted with the hashtag #20Qs4DeanK varied in nature. Many students asked questions regarding the dean’s personal preferences.
“If you could take any class at USC what would it be and why?” tweeted Caroline Friend, a sophomore majoring in film production and history.
Friend said she was interested in Kay’s choice because she believes class choices can be indicative of personality.
“I thought it would be interesting because there are so many options across USC in general,” Friend said. “I think it tells a lot about a person to see what classes they’re interested in.”
Edwards-McQuilton, who asked Kay what his most memorable course was as an undergraduate student, said she believes administrators have a lot more in common with students than most students think, and she’s interested in hearing Kay’s perspective on a number of issues.
“When I think about administrators, I often forget that they were once students too,” Edwards-McQuilton said. “They might have had the same or at least similar experiences as students are having now.”
Kay encouraged not only questions about his personality, but also questions to get to know him better professionally.
“I asked Dean Kay what his vision was for making USC more accepted in the scientific community because right now USC is not considered to be a really top-tier science school, even though we just had our latest Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, which would be Professor [Ariel] Warshel,” Tham said. “So now we have two Nobel laureates in chemistry, but at the same time, USC is not considered to be a strong science school.”
Tham listened to one of Kay’s speeches, during which he said Kay was articulate, outspoken and cultured, with a strong scientific background.
“I could tell that he’s very passionate about biology and doing research,” Tham said. “So I thought, ‘If this is our new dean, maybe USC could have a bigger impact in the scientific community.’”
Kay also uses the hashtag #Koolscience as a way to promote scientific research and news.
“I’m a scientist at heart, so I follow research and scientific news very closely,” Kay said. “Using the hashtag #Koolscience is my way of sharing interesting and noteworthy scientific findings.”
Kay is an avid Twitter user. He first launched his account on the social media site at the USC Dornsife Initiative kickoff event on March 9, 2013.
“My goal is to let our community know that through Twitter they have a direct way of interacting with me,” Kay said.
Kay was appointed the 21st dean of Dornsife in May of 2012 and started his post during the following fall semester in October.
“I wouldn’t mind having lunch with him or talking about sports or whatever,” Tham said. “He’s just a really cool guy.”

After touring nine months this year, while headlining almost every major music festival and being recognized as one of the world’s leading electric dance music artists, Alesso will now head to the City of Angels to perform at the Shrine Auditorium on Friday.
Going places · Only 22 years old, Alesso has already established himself as one of the biggest names in electronic dance music. Now he is tailoring his signature style, focusing on emotional songs with strong chords and melodies. – Courtesy of Alesso’s Official Facebook Page
 
Following two successful shows in Canada, Alesso is bringing his inspirational legacy with him to the States.
“I want people to listen to my music and hopefully they can remember something, or think about something,” Alesso said. “Like people who are going through hard times. I think it’s important to have some sort of message with your music, because music is so powerful.”
Powered by 26,000 first-week downloads, Alesso’s newest track, “Under Control” with fellow industry giant, Calvin Harris, is ushering in a dance music revolution. The duo began working together this year in a collaboration that Alesso called “very natural.” And how exactly did two of the gods of EDM promote this sensational union?
“We were just talking to each other during Miami Music Week. We were talking to each other and he said, ‘I have an idea, and it reminds me of you. Would you be interested in doing a collaboration with me?’ And I went, ‘Yes of course,’” he said. “At first, we started through emails, and after that I flew to London and we recorded the vocals with him.”
“Under Control” demonstrates just how magical a collaboration between two successful artists can be. Alesso first dropped the track at a set in Ibiza this past summer. “Under Control” features an unwavering ’90s house beat and rave synths building rudiments beneath Theo Hutchcraft’s sensational vocals. With Harris’ vibrant beats and Alesso’s elaborate and forceful sound, the track builds an anticipation that is difficult to get over, even after the crescendo.
And though Alesso doesn’t have a wealth of experience to dwell on, he has taken inspiration from the presiding gods of the EDM genre. It was only a few years ago that Alesso struggled to convince fellow Swede Sebastian Ingrosso (of Swedish House Mafia) to listen to the amateur CD that he had created. Just earlier this year, Alesso, along with several other EDM artists, bid farewell to Swedish House Mafia, who disbanded after a final show at Ultra Music Festival in Miami.
After such meteoric success, Alesso no longer needs to transform his sound to appease his audience. Instead, he sticks to his signature style.
“I’ve always been in love with melodic songs,” Alesso said. “Very emotional songs, and chords and melodies that kind of count for something. That’s always been the main thing that I wanted to focus on.”
And even more recently, Alesso’s work with Calvin Harris taught him a few essentials about his own technique.
“I love Calvin Harris. I learned a lot, because he’s such an amazing songwriter,” Alesso said. “That’s something that I wanna start working with more. Calvin is very good at that.”
At just 22, Alleso has already performed at some of the world’s biggest venues. Still, he has to pick one as his absolute favorite.
“Ultra Music Festival, Miami. That was a very big moment for me. … The production was incredible,” he said.
After launching an impressive Uprising tour, headlining the Main Stage at this year’s Electric Zoo Festival and releasing a storm of original hits, what else is in sight for this young superstar?
“I just realized this is the ninth month of the year that I’m touring,” Alesso remarked. “I’ve been touring a lot this year and of course I’m going to tour in 2014, but I really, really want to get into the studio and maybe start making an album. Because I’ve never done an album before, which, if I do, I’m going to need a lot of time. You get tired, you need to find inspiration — you can’t force that.”
Despite all the fame and glory that comes with traveling the world and playing with some of EDM’s most famed artists, Alesso still said he is humbled by his fans.
“I have to say, I love my fans. I feel like I relate to them. They’re like me,” he said. “They like my music, and when I play my songs to my fans, we connect.”
And though the Shrine is certainly not his biggest venue on the tour, Alesso seemed sentimental about the L.A. vibe. The city has been the site of several recent memorable events for the artist, and Nov. 22 will prove to be no different.
“It’s gonna feel like I’m coming home,” he said.

Thanksgiving season is right around the corner. Though it’s easy to get carried away stuffing ourselves with turkey and mashed potatoes, delicious cornbread and apple pies, the heart of the holiday is all about the people we are thankful for — our loved ones.
So whether you’re sharing this Thanksgiving with your family at home, friends at school or your significant other, all kinds of love is in the air. In honor of this, I’ve compiled a playlist celebrating the one thing poets, writers, singers and your everyday guy have tried to tackle throughout time: love.
“Slow Love”     — Michael Alvarado

Curly-haired heartthrob Michael Alvarado found his start on YouTube, producing piano-heavy tunes and awaiting his big break as a one-man band. Since his marriage to fellow YouTube sensation Carissa Rae, Alvarado has been spending his time whipping up collaborative tunes under the moniker “Us.” Alvarado’s expertise in piano, guitar and drums shines through in this cheerful melody. The song opens with Alvarado crooning, “See me I’m nervous / What did it take to deserve this / Beautiful love, it’s perfect / Baby without you I’m worthless,” and transforms into a relaxing number you’ll most likely have on repeat for the rest of your day.
“Heartbeats” — Jose Gonzalez

Swedish indie-folk singer Jose Gonzalez croons this number that’s not as overtly lovey-dovey as the rest of the tracks on this week’s playlist. But take a closer listen to his lullaby-like voice and you’ll recognize the heartfelt tone behind lines like, “One night of magic rush / The start, a simple touch / One night to push and scream / And then relief.”
“Lay Lady Lay” — Magnet
Norwegian singer Even Johansen, who goes by the stage name Magnet, takes on the famous Bob Dylan number trumps every cover known to man. The inclusion of a female voice, Irish musician Gemma Hayes, brings this track to a whole new level. The commanding violin strings carry the voices of Johansen and Hayes.
“You and I” — Ingrid Michaelson

Fans of Sara Bareilles and Regina Spektor need no further description to this track. But for those who have yet to be introduced to singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, here’s a treat to the ears unlike any other. Picked from one of her earliest albums, this ukulele-happy duet is perfect for the holidays: “Oh, let’s get rich and buy our parents homes / In the south of France / Let’s get rich and give everybody nice sweaters / And teach them how to dance.” And though Michaelson’s raspy-voiced producer, Dan Romer, sings the male verses in the original track, Jason Mraz and Michaelson have performed this song regularly on tour.
“Old School Love” — Ed Sheeran and Lupe Fiasco
You can’t complete a love song playlist without 2013’s ultimate romantic: Ed Sheeran. English singer-songwriter Sheeran rose to fame with tender tunes such as “The A-Team” and “Lego House.” After touring with Taylor Swift this past year, his songs have received even more well-deserved attention. This creative collaboration with rapper Lupe Fiasco, famous for hypnotic songs such as “Fighters” and “Daydreamin,’” is making its way up the music charts.
“Falling in Love (With My Best Friend)” — Matt White

New Jersey-born Matt White refined his musical talents at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and eventually harnessed the power of MySpace to spread his singles. Geffen Records noticed his popularity on the social networking site and offered him a record deal; since then, he’s toured with big names such as Sheryl Crow and OneRepublic.
Though White sings of heartbreak in “Falling in Love,” the song’s upbeat rhythm makes it a worthy addition to this week’s playlist — and it’s a gentle reminder that love isn’t always as peachy as it looks in the movies.

On a bustling Friday night, a singer known for her sweet-sounding voice and piano-driven melodies performed at a small intimate venue called the Largo at the Coronet. Though medical issues forced her to cancel the rest of her November concerts, Vanessa Carlton performed flawlessly to a full house.

The show’s opener, Birdcloud, entertained the audience with merry but vulgar satirical songs. Moreover, the duo’s raunchy country sound stands in stark contrast to the Top 40-gumball-pop music commonly heard on the radio. These girls were not afraid to break the cultural norm as they gleefully sang their edgy songs about sexuality. Their performance was well-received by the diverse crowd, who showered the duo with whistles and cheers. During the small break after their performance, the crowd walked toward the lobby, filling the quiet area with congratulatory words commemorating Birdcloud on its fearless act of female sexuality.
After the 20-minute break, the crowd returned to their seats, exchanging excited glances and eager words in preparation for the main event. Suddenly, the lights dimmed as the small crowd threw themselves into a cheering frenzy. A hush fell over the crowd as Carlton walked across the stage with her close friend and violinist Skye Steele. A quiet but powerful voice that could be heard all the way in the back row broke the silence with a cheerful greeting, which transformed the room from a gathering of strangers to a reunion of longtime friends.
Carlton began the show with a mash-up of her song “Carousel” and a cover of “Learning to Fly,” originally sung by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Carlton’s light fingers danced on her Yamaha piano keys as the notes fell over the crowd. Immediately after the opening number, Carlton appropriately followed with fan favorites “Hands on Me” and “Nolita Fairytale.” Steele’s violin harmonized with Carlton’s voice, which followed the piano’s low and high pitches.
Carlton felt comfortable with the crowd as she spoke about her inspiration for one of her newest songs. She wrote “House of Seven Swords” for her brother’s graduation as a gift to him. Indeed, Carlton found a familiar niche as she openly shared several personal stories with the crowd. Later she discussed the  “interesting” but stressful experience of releasing an album independently without a label. Luckily, she has her family, her fans and her dog to support her through tough times.
According to Carlton, “Tall Tales For Spring” is the “mom song” because her mother would always start dancing when Carlton practiced the song. The song blends soft drums, a melancholy violin and Carlton’s signature honey-sweet voice accompanied by a catchy rhythm. Despite the fact that the set comprised of unreleased and lesser-known songs, the audience swayed to the music.
Halfway into the show, Carlton began to play an unfamiliar melody on her piano. Confused, some fans sat on edge, attempting to predict what song she was playing next. Carlton teased the audience as she held a note on the piano, causing the fans to become tenser. When the crowd realized she was leading up to “White Houses,” they began an intense, united cheer. Suddenly, the venue became a choir led by a single angelic voice.
The surprises continued when Carlton moved from her Yamaha to an aged, wooden piano on the side. For this song, she triumphantly donned a largely tusked Viking helmet. Carlton announced her plans to marry John McCauley of the band Deer Tick next month before ironically singing “I Don’t Want to be a Bride.” The song’s bittersweet, quirky romanticism involved much more than the usual shower of piano notes. During the bridge of the song, Birdcloud came onstage with Vanessa’s young godniece Daisy. Steele contributed his bass vocals while playing the  violin. All five of them harmonized as a multitalented family to conclude the show.
After a standing ovation with nonstop cheers and claps, a wave of nostalgia washed over the crowd as Carlton and Steele returned to the stage to perform their most well-known hit, “A Thousand Miles.” Steele and Carlton finished strong, and the crowd gave them a second standing ovation as they walked offstage. Immediately after the performance, the audience rushed to the lobby in hopes of meeting the singer.
And after that spectacular night, these fans would travel a thousand miles just to see Vanessa Carlton again.

Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Geoffrey Cowan hosted a discussion with New York Times journalist Adam Nagourney and Pulitzer Prize and Tony award-winning author and director David Auburn at the West Coast premiere of his new play The Columnist.
Media and society · Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Geoffrey Cowan led a discussion on journalism in honor of The Columnist, which focuses on the life of controversial writer Joseph Aslop. – Courtesy of USC Media Relations
The Columnist tells the story of journalist Joseph Alsop, who for more than 30 years worked in Washington, D.C. and passionately supported an escalation of the war in Vietnam. Alsop was a friend of politicians in a way that few journalists or columnists are today.
But to his foes, Alsop was relentless, calling all those who did not support a push for victory in Vietnam “cowards,” and few escaped his pen’s wrath — including President Lyndon B. Johnson. When Johnson chose to deploy another 50,000 troops to Vietnam, he is reported to have said: “There, that should keep Joe Alsop quiet for a while.”
As The Columnist demonstrates, however, Alsop was not so forthright about everything in his life. The writer was a closeted homosexual, and was married to his wife Susan only to conform to the period’s social norms. A work that follows the life of a man who yielded such force, and yet whose memory today is shrouded in obscurity, however, is partially justified by the fact that Alsop was not a typical antihero. As Cowan pointed out in the post-play discussion, “We have a tendency to romanticize the past, but Alsop, we liked him even though he was a bastard.”
But the nature of the performance, which was done without sets or costumes and with the actors using scripts, provided an interesting opportunity for the actors to demonstrate true emotional depth.
The performance was interesting not only due to its characters and subject matter, but also in the execution its dialogue. Rather than moving around the stage, the actors, all of whom remained onstage throughout the play, delivered their lines into a radio microphone because the performance will air on L.A. Theatre Works’ syndicated radio theater series, which broadcasts weekly on public radio stations nationwide. This made it all the more powerful when Stewart Alsop (John Getz) — who, unbeknownst to his brother, was suffering from leukemia — begged his brother Joseph to listen to the voices of the students against the war.
Equally as powerful was JoBeth Williams’ performance as Susan, a woman trapped in a marriage devoid of physical contact. Williams had to use only the slightest bit of inflection to demonstrate her true anguish.
Nagourney said one of the play’s most interesting developments is that Alsop was a true Washington insider, hosting dinner parties and schmoozing with political bigwigs such as former Ford Motor Co. president and President John F. Kennedy’s Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.
What has changed most drastically since Alsop’s time, Nagourney said, is that journalists can now be open about their sexuality. At the start of his career, Nagourney, who is openly gay, feared his sexuality would prevent him from getting a job at The New York Times. Now, he jokes, it might be easier to get a job at the Times as a gay individual since many current political reporters are. One of his openly gay colleagues even had a wedding announcement in the Times, something that was simply unheard of for Alsop.
Comparing today’s media and the news organizations of the 1960s is what drew Auburn to Alsop’s story. Today, there are many more columns or opinionated articles available to readers.
“I think it’s more democratic now,” he said.
But Nagourney said that with the plethora of material available to readers today, columnists are seen as less of an authority because people have more choices to make and can choose what news and opinions cater to their interests.
“It’s much harder being a news consumer these days,” he said, noting that technology has changed the way readers react to material.
“Alsop would never have gotten 500 tweets about a story,” Nagourney said.
Often, it seemed as though Alsop was writing more for himself than for his readers, and he fought a tireless campaign against journalists such as the young David Halberstam, who wrote extensively in opposition to the war. Auburn said he appreciated the commitment Alsop had to his beliefs — though sometimes these beliefs were not popular among his peers. Alsop’s autobiography ended with his coverage of the Kennedy administration, choosing not to venture into later debates over America’s role in Vietnam.
“He was a man of strong opinions and informed and I liked that,” Auburn said, “but he was flawed in his ability to moderate himself and even toward the end of his career he was turning into a joke.”
During his research for the play, Auburn said he spoke to Alsop’s family members, including his stepdaughter Anne. In their discussions, Anne told Auburn of her stepfather’s difficult personality. “She told me, ‘You have to bully a bully,’” Auburn said. For the purposes of the play, Anne and her brother were combined into the character of Abigail, played by Tara Lynne Barr.
Auburn said he was somewhat fearful when Anne told him that the Alsop family reunion was taking place in New York during The Columnist’s Broadway run and the whole family bought tickets.
“I could just imagine how awful it would look when the center five rows of a Broadway theater got up and walked out,” Auburn said.
But his concerns were unfounded since the family enjoyed the play.
Still, much has changed since the beginning of Alsop’s career. Nagourney said presidents are no longer seen as friends with the press, and scandals such as Watergate shifted the journalist’s relationship with the government from a partnership to a more adversarial one. For someone who wrote stories for a living, however, Alsop’s story was worth retelling.
“I’m not sure there are any journalists on the scene now that people 30 years from now will be writing a play about,” he said.

As co-sports editor of the Daily Trojan, I generally find it quite easy to separate my duties as an unbiased reporter and fan loyalties as a USC student. I usually cover every home football game from the press box as an impartial observer, and don’t take too much pleasure in a Trojan win or experience that much sadness in a USC loss.
So with that prelude, I must admit that when Washington State humiliated USC in the home opener, I was a little giddy after the game. It wasn’t because I was a devout hater of former head coach Lane Kiffin and wanted to witness whatever needed to happen to get him fired — in fact, I was probably one of the last people in the world who believed he could have turned this team around. I was happy because that defeat signaled this would be no ordinary season that’d see the Trojans win when they’re supposed to win, lose when they’re supposed to lose and have Kiffin retain his job by simply going par for the course. By and large, I wanted USC to perform in a manner that would be most interesting to cover as a journalist. Because after I graduate this year, I’ll still be able to root for the Trojans, but who knows if I’ll be able to obtain a job that allows me to report about them.
That being said, I knew from the beginning of the season that for the Stanford game, I simply had to forgo the privilege of being able to sit in the press box for one last go-around in the student section. There had been games this season I was more eager to cover as a reporter; for example, the opportunity to write about the continuation of USC’s legendary rivalry against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. But there was no other matchup I had more eagerly anticipated as a fan than USC’s showdown against the Farm.
I would have easily taken a win against Stanford over one against UCLA. Maybe that’s because I didn’t grow up in Los Angeles or have any Bruin relatives or friends to bicker back and forth with over the years.
But I think it was because my graduation class was in danger of becoming only the second USC class to finish their undergraduate years without seeing a victory over our oldest rivals (raise a glass for the class of 2013, whom I hold much empathy for). I think it was because I experienced my all-time low as a sports fan last year while exiting Stanford Stadium after watching the Cardinal upset No. 2 USC and seeing their fans storm the field. The Trojans aren’t my favorite sports team — my hometown Atlanta Braves will always hold that title — but I had never felt such hopelessness after a loss to a rival; if we couldn’t beat Stanford with Matt Barkley under center, when would we?
After that loss last season, it was easy to see that Barkley and the rest of the Trojan players felt a similar sense of despair. But it was just as easy to discern that when USC started preparing for Stanford last week, that painful memory would motivate each player to taste sweet victory against the Cardinal for the first time in their careers.
“This game was very special to a lot of us,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “It was a great win for the university.”
Even interim head coach Ed Orgeron, who’s never one to place more emphasis on one game in the regular season over any others, admitted there was a different atmosphere around this contest.
“For some reason, on Monday there was a belief that we were going to prepare as well as we could and find a way to win the game,” Orgeron said. “This is something we’ve wanted for the past Trojans and coaches that fought hard. This is for the Trojan Family.”
Saturday’s victory over Stanford was another reminder that USC’s 2013 campaign is anything but a normal season.
Most years, a win against Stanford wouldn’t merit a storming of the field. I talked to several proud USC students and alumni who said before the game that they would stay in their seats if the Trojans did pull off the program’s biggest upset victory since who knows when. Those folks said we needed to act like we’ve been there before.
But the thing is, no one in the student section — or on the sidelines, for that matter — had been “there” before. Thanks to a soul-crushing combination of bowl restrictions, scholarship reductions and general incompetence, the current generation of USC students had become jaded by the Kiffin era that was full of conservative playcalling and disappointing defeats.
So this victory washed that bad taste out of the mouths of even the most cynical USC fans.
When Orgeron was faced with the decision of whether or not to go for it on fourth-and-2 near midfield with 1:23 left, I felt for him. If the Trojans tried to convert and failed, it was all too easy to imagine Stanford’s smash-mouth ground game putting the Cardinal in position for a game-winning field goal.
I wouldn’t have gone for it. Kiffin wouldn’t have gone for it. But Orgeron believed in his players — specifically, a hobbled former Heisman candidate in junior wideout Marqise Lee and  redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who matured in front of our eyes with a virtuoso performance — and it paid off.
Now, Orgeron has Trojan Nation believing he’s the man to lead USC football back to national prominence after another inspired victory.
I’m sure glad I witnessed that season-defining triumph in the student section. And you’re damn right I stormed the field.

I liked everything about this article except for the ucla part.  Beating uclame this year is as important as it ever was.  Fight on!
Did Kessler actually throw a pass to Lee for that last first down?  Did you see it?  I have watched the film several times, now, and have yet to see a ball flying through the air, between two Stanfords, who seemed to be draped all over Lee, and Lee catching the ball.  Lee goes down, guys are jumping all over the place, so it must have happened.  Two questions:  Can Kessler pass?  Can Lee catch? And while you’re at it, please explain to me how Cravens made that interception, using moves last seen in a Cirque du Soleil act….
Yesssss! Coach O has restored some of the tarnished glory of SC after Lame Kiffin and his chief enabler, Pat Haden, allowed the mighty Trojan football program to be brought low.
Saturday reminded me of another long ago night when I watched as Ron Ayala broke Stanford’s heart with his last second field goal!  
Fight on!!
this sounds like a very honest account, from the heart. Good writing …and had to read to end, some sports articles cause my eyes to ‘glaze over’. Not this one.

Unlike the USC football team, the No. 2-ranked USC men’s water polo team was unable to overcome No.4-ranked Stanford, who netted an overtime buzzer beater to upset the Trojans 17-16 on Senior Day in a Saturday matinee at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. USC (23-3, 5-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was able to bounce back with a 10-8 win on Sunday against No. 8-ranked Long Beach State in the team’s final regular season home game.

When it appeared that a sudden-death overtime period was on the horizon, Stanford’s Paul Rudolph scored from long distance at the buzzer to shock the Trojans and prevail on the road. The most important goal of the game was Rudolph’s fourth on the day.
The loss also snapped USC’s 35-game home win streak.
“It was definitely tough to swallow, but as the season goes on, we just have to learn from our mistakes and grow from it,” redshirt junior driver Zach Lucas said. “It was a good learning opportunity for us.”
Stanford (18-4, 6-1 MPSF) led the Trojans for the majority of the game before USC clawed its way back to tie the game and eventually take a two-goal lead, 15-13, in overtime on goals by senior driver Nikola Vavic and senior two-meter Connor Virjee.
Stanford, however, capitalized on a six-on-five situation to come back and tie the game at 15-15 heading into the second frame of overtime.
In the second overtime period, senior utility Mace Rapsey struck a quick shot into the net to give the Trojans a one-goal edge before the Cardinal’s Alex Bowen tallied the equalizer and his fifth goal of the game with just 33 seconds remaining.
Rapsey led the Trojans in scoring with four goals, while Virjee, junior driver Kostas Genidounias and Vavic all piled up hat tricks. Senior goalie James Clark made seven saves in goal.
Looking to rebound against Long Beach State, the Trojans did exactly that and finished the home portion of their schedule on the right note, defeating the 49ers for the second time this season.
“We came back and regrouped as a team,” senior two-meter Jeremy Davie said. “Everyone refocused on what we need to do, and we worked hard as a team to get another victory.”
Lucas tallied a hat trick to lead the Trojan scoring attack, while Genidounias added two goals of his own.
“We played more for each other today, and we wanted to make our last game at home a strong one,” Lucas said. “Our passing and communication on offense and defense was also a lot better.”
USC led 4-3 at the half, but put in three goals in the third period to establish some more breathing room, leading 7-4 heading into the final period, where they were outscored by the 49ers 4-3 to close out the game.
The Trojans will next travel across town to take on rival UCLA on Thursday in Westwood, Calif. The Bruins will be looking to avenge a 12-11 overtime defeat in the championship game of the SoCal Tournament. USC won the game on a buzzer-beating goal by Genidounias.
“We’re always excited to play the Bruins,” Davie said. “It’s a crosstown rivalry, the last game of the regular season, and we’re going to come out on fire.”

Behind an unrivaled resilience on both sides of the ball, the Trojans embodied the “one team, one heartbeat” message that interim head coach Ed Orgeron had been preaching to them all week leading up to Saturday’s showdown with the No. 4-ranked Stanford Cardinal.
Making his mark · USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron celebrates during the Trojans’ dramatic 20-17 victory over Stanford. The win was the program’s first time beating the Cardinal since the 2008 season. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
And on one kick, with the game hanging in the balance tied at 17-17, USC junior kicker Andre Heidari, who had struggled all season and nearly lost his starting job weeks ago, was able to lift the Trojans (8-3, 5-2 Pac-12) to an upset victory over the Cardinal (8-2, 6-2). One final stop by the USC defense sealed the 20-17 victory in front of a sold-out crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Heidari’s 47-yard field goal with just 19 seconds remaining was the deciding factor that allowed the Trojans to shock a Stanford team that was coming off of an upset of their own when they defeated then-No. 3 Oregon 26-20 just over a week ago.
Though he has had his struggles this season and nearly lost his starting job, Heidari was able to deliver in the game’s most pivotal moment.
“I did what I needed to do,” Heidari said. “I’m glad my team put me into the position and that my teammates believed in me.”
It was apparent throughout the game that the College GameDay hype that began very early Saturday morning at McCarthy Quad transitioned to the Coliseum. The Trojans fed off of that energy, defeating Stanford for the first time since 2008.
Once the clock ran out, thousands of fans poured onto the field to celebrate USC’s first victory over a ranked team since 2011 and congratulate a team that has been playing inspired football since Orgeron took over for former head coach Lane Kiffin.
“This was a win for the entire Trojan Family,” Orgeron said. “I’m happy for the fans, it’s been a long time coming.”
The Trojans are 5-1 with Orgeron at the helm, spurring even more conversation that the former defensive line coach could be named USC’s permanent head coach once the season ends.
“Obviously there’s going to be some decisions made here after we play UCLA,” Orgeron said. “That [decision] is out of my hands.”
With all the excitement over his team’s marquee victory, Orgeron had plenty of things to focus on other than his job status come season’s end. The man who has been involved with the USC football program for more than a decade was elated for his players and assistant coaches to come away with such a big win.
“In our tight-knit family, there was a belief that we were going to find a way to win the game,” Orgeron said. “I’m proud of our young men. This is something that they’ve wanted for a long time now.”
On a night when former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy-winner Matt Leinart led the team out of the tunnel, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler looked sharp against a tough Stanford defense. He threw for 288 yards and one touchdown while completing 25 of his 37 passes.
In the first half, only two of Kessler’s pass attempts were incomplete.
The most crucial play of the night came on a fourth-down conversion with just over one minute left in the game. Kessler found junior wide receiver Marqise Lee on fourth and two for a 13-yard gain that extended the Trojans’ eventual game-winning drive. Lee proceeded to hobble off the field following the play, due to what he thought was a bone bruise.
“I knew I was taking a chance,” Orgeron said of the decision to leave his offense on the field on fourth down. “But I looked inside their eyes, and as a coach, I wanted to give the guys a chance to win the game. I had no hesitation at all to go for it.”
Lee, who claimed he felt 100 percent earlier in the week, finished the night with six catches for 83 yards.
“I knew he was in pain, but I had trust in him that he was going to be open, and I just threw the ball and he was there to make the play,” Kessler said.
Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor had another big game, catching eight passes for 104 yards.
When the offense began to struggle in the second half, it was the Trojans’ stalwart defense that made the big plays USC needed in order to stay in the game.
After Kessler fumbled deep in USC territory, the defense kept the Cardinal out of the end zone and forced a field goal attempt. The kick was blocked by redshirt freshman offensive tackle Chad Wheeler to keep the game tied at 17-17.
In the fourth quarter, Stanford had the ball at the USC 10-yard line when redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey intercepted Cardinal quarterback Kevin Hogan’s pass and returned it to the USC 34-yard line, sending the Coliseum crowd into a frenzy.
“It was one of the most electrifying atmospheres I have played in in my four years here,” Bailey said. “This was a great win for the university.”
With only three minutes remaining to play, the defense again rose to the occasion when freshman safety Su’a Cravens intercepted a deflected pass from Hogan that set up the USC offense for a drive that ultimately won the game.
Stanford’s 17-point offensive output was the fewest points scored for the Cardinal this season.
“An outstanding job by [defensive coordinator] Clancy Pendergast, [defensive line coach] Pete Jenkins and all of our linebackers for hanging in there toe-to-toe with the Stanford offensive line,” Orgeron said.
The USC running game, which had been so successful in recent weeks, was held in check by the vaunted Stanford defense, gaining just 23 yards on 27 attempts. Redshirt sophomore running back Javorius ‘Buck’ Allen scored a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the first quarter to give USC a 14-7 lead.
Stanford’s running game, however, was relentless and paced its offense, as the Cardinal rushed for 210 yards on 35 carries behind their stout offensive line. Cardinal running back Tyler Gaffney had 24 carries for 158 yards and two touchdowns.
Gaffney scored on a 35-yard run in the first quarter to answer Kessler’s one-yard touchdown pass to redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku on the Trojans’ first drive of the game.
USC’s win was its first home victory against Stanford in its last three meetings. In 2011, Stanford outlasted USC in a classic triple-overtime loss against then-Cardinal quarterback Andrew Luck.
The Trojans not only derailed Stanford’s national title aspirations by pulling off the upset, but also kept their own Pac-12 championship and Rose Bowl hopes alive. With two games remaining, USC would win the Pac-12 South by winning its final two games and having Arizona State lose its final two games.
For the time being, though, Orgeron and the rest of the team are not concerned with their place in the standings. Coming off of the biggest win for the program in nearly two years, the team plans on simply enjoying the moment.
“To see [the players] smiling and happy with winning, that’s all we want as a staff,” Orgeron said. “Besides going to the big bowl games and beating UCLA, this is probably the best.”

The Stanford game is what USC football is all about.  That was an incredibly fun game to watch and made believers out of all the naysayers.  Now it’s time to make Coach O the permanent coach.  Fight on!

According to NPR, President Barack Obama recently told Congress to hold off on new sanctions against Iran in the wake of the stalling nuclear negotiations. Given that another way to give Iran some safety is with economic cooperation, the sanctions end up forcing Iran’s hand, making them more likely to pursue a nuclear weapon rather than bringing them to their knees.
Unfortunately, some members of Congress do not seem to understand this point as the Foreign Policy Journal reports. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) explained in a letter to the editor of USA Today that he was pursuing tougher sanctions against Iran to force President Hassan Rouhani and Ayatollah Ali Khomeini to give up Iran’s nuclear program.
The problem with this logic is that Iran will not fold economically on the back of U.S. sanctions alone. Iran is still able to export significant amounts of oil to China, a growing consumer of oil as the country expands economically. Iran is not going to fold so easily.
The call for sanctions demonstrates that the United States is not completely unified behind Obama in negotiations with Iran. The president only has power in dealing with Iran if he can show that he has enough control of the domestic political situation to ensure that any agreement with Iran can be enforced. If not, then Iran has no reason to negotiate with the United States.
The negotiations are facing similarly fractious problems because of the lack of unity within the P5+1 group running the talks. France, according to Foreign Policy, recently ended the talks and scuttled the deal to assert more control over the situation. Frankly, this is not the time for France or anyone in the international community to be playing games at the negotiating table. Rouhani has proved to be more moderate and willing to talk than any of his predecessors, and Iran is on the brink of either developing a nuclear weapon or taking meaningful steps toward giving up its nuclear program. France, by jockeying for power, is putting peace in the Middle East at risk.
Disunity even presents itself when considering nations not directly involved in this round of talks. Israel has long been critical of any course of action that leaves Iran with enough autonomy to create a nuclear weapon. Though Israel is not part of this round of talks, their presence is always felt when dealing with Iran. Israel, which is known for deploying Mossad agents to kill Iranian nuclear scientists, could escalate their military involvement to preemptively strike Iran if they believed they could destroy enough of Iran’s nuclear capabilities to prevent nuclear enrichment and bomb creation. If the talks with Iran do not stop Iran from developing a weapon, or if Israel does not agree with the course that talks are taking, they could take matters into their own hands and attempt to deal with Iran themselves. Thus, there is little reason for Iran to continue to negotiate with Western powers if they believe they are threatened by Israel, which is one of the most heavily militarized countries in the Middle East. The international community needs to be able to bring Israel in line to encourage Iran to work with the West to give up nuclear weapons. Any break from this unity threatens the talks, which threatens Israel, which threatens Iran. Disunity is a self-defeating stance for Israel.
In the same way, because Iran might be reluctant to give up nuclear weapons in the face of a possible Israeli attack, Iran might also be unwilling to give up its weapons program just because there is no enforcement of international treaties. Agreements in the world of international relations are based on reciprocity, not because of enforcement from an overarching authority. Those agreements have to be based on trust, and that trust is unlikely in a situation in which the world cannot unite behind a single tactic when dealing with Iran. The world has to unite to make any kind of agreement work with Iran. If the world does not unite, Iran will be forced to distrust any kind of arrangement and be self-sufficient for security.
The negotiations with Iran are unlikely to succeed as long as the world continues to stand apart on the issue. Dissent itself is the most likely reason to sink the current round of negotiations.

JohnWV,
You need help.  Your hatred of Jews blinds you of your reason.  Your logic is twisted and so are you.
Israel has ICBM nukes and openly threatens Iran, actually campaigns for an American war against Iran. The Jewish state instigated all our other Mideast wars and benefited from all. None were in American interests, yet we did the dying and wrecked our economy. The Jewish state has occupied not just Palestine, but America too. Cunning distribution of enormous amounts of Jewish money have wrested control of our congress, wrecked our economy and enabled Israel’s wars and racist malevolence. The Wall Street felons remaining unpunished, AIPAC actually writing congressional legislation and lack of treason indictments attest to the depth of the occupation. Our democracy is cunningly being overthrown from within and transformed into a world dominating racist ultrapower, the JEWISH STATE OF AMERICA.
The nuclear negotiations with Iran are a crafty sham on their part. They seek to sweet-talk the gullible West, win concessions and thereby relieve pressure on their economy, while they drag out the “negotiations” until they have their nuclear weapons. Then the West and Israel will simply have to learn to live with a nuclear weaponized Iran, just as we did with the former USSR, China, No. Korea and Russia.
So how will this end? Ultimately it will end when US satellites and ground sensors record a nuclear test detonation in the Iranian desert. You will then see it on TV, the internet and elsewhere.

Texans love their guns — there is hardly any disagreement about that. Many consider attending gun shows, buying tickets to Western movies and revelling in the “shoot ‘em up” scenes to be a United States tradition.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Yet, even if Texas weren’t already obsessed with guns, the latest technology coming out of the state now brings the weapons much closer to home. Solid Concepts, a Texas company, announced on Nov. 8 that they had made the first metal gun using a 3-D printer, according to CNN. The company said the pistol resembles a M1911 handgun. It was built from mostly stainless-steel parts and essentially feels and looks like an actual handgun. As a licensed firearm manufacturer, Solid Concepts said it will look into the possibility of selling replacement parts for handguns.
“The engineers who run our [3-D printing] machines are top of the line; they are experts who know what they’re doing and understand 3-D printing better than anyone in this business,” Solid Concepts spokeswoman Alyssa Parkinson told CNN.
The company also believes that only the most skilled experts will have access to this potentially deadly innovation.
In addition, the company believes the hefty price of a 3-D printer will help deter the wrong people from being able to create the gun.
“The industrial printer we used costs more than my college tuition [and I went to a private university],” Parkinson told CNN.
Unfortunately, people can purchase other 3-D printers for the rather-reasonable price of $2,199.
Despite the belief that most people won’t be able to afford the equipment to produce their own guns, the debate surrounds the failure to secure formidable prevention methods to gun violence and an unnecessary prevalence of guns in this country. Criminals could even end up creating copies of 3-D printed guns.
In the week since the company announced their new gun-making capabilities, 25-year-old Cody Wilson, who in the past had expressed his affinity toward anarchy and is a member of the nonprofit group Defense Distributed, posted instructions on how to make the gun online. If Solid Concepts’ prevention methods are so bulletproof, then it should not be easy to access building instructions.
Wilson’s posting was so detrimental that the U.S. State Department sent Defense Distributed a cease-and-desist letter. Shortly after, its website was shut down.
The 3-D-printed gun is not the first 21st-century gun to cause controversy. On Nov. 14, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms released the results from tests it conducted on another downloadable 3-D printed weapon, referred to as the Liberator. In its report, the ATF said the printed gun was both “dangerous” and was often susceptible to not working. Digital Trends reported an incident where one 3-D-printed gun exploded.
For quite some time, the gun debate in this country has focused on who can get guns and where they can purchase them. The emergence of the 3-D-printed gun brings a new element to this continuous topic: who can make guns. In weeks following the Los Angeles International Airport and the Washington Navy Yard shootings, the current political climate surrounding guns is not adequately prepared to interrupt the possible ramifications of allowing guns to be made by the common man.
Instead, the U.S. government needs to limit its focus on regulating the guns that are already in the marketplace, and not deciding how to bring more in. The 21st century, however, is inevitably replete with technological innovations such as the 3-D gun printer, and the gun debate is only bound to get more heated.

Editors Note: The headline of the article was changed from “3-D printing of guns will harm society greatly” to “Government should consider future implications of 3-D gun printing” to better reflect the content of the article. 
Okay, let me get this straight…
Despite advances in backscatter X-ray, millimeter-wave scanners, and thermoconductive imaging, people still think that plastic is undetectable?
Yeah sure, and the same people who are willing to kill will follow a law that says not to make an accessory for the crime, and somehow it’s better than more money goes to the big bad evil gun industry than to 3D printing. 
Stop HR 1474 and S 1149.
Bottom line – we can ban everything from guns to rocks – as long as we have people intent on hurting other people the laws make very little difference. There are thousands of assaults per year with baseball bats – why are we not banning baseball? Crappy parents crapping out kids that they do not parent – that is  what we need to ban if we really are serious about crime. Otherwise the prisons will always have a fresh population to fill their cells.
“In the week since the company announced their new gun-making capabilities, 25-year-old Cody Wilson, who in the past had expressed his affinity toward ANARCHY…”
Stop.  Where did Cody Wilson express an affinity for “anarchy”?   Journalist Brian Doherty of Reason described Wilson as “more than just a gun guy”, adding that Wilson may be “right about how it has to end: the people will have the power.”  No anarchy here: just a man trying to fire a figurative warning shot across the bows of a government that has exceeded its constitutional bounds.
Flawed Premise: You can only “make” your own gun with 3-D printers.
Fact: People have been “making” their own guns for years using a variety of methods, without an expensive 3-D printer.  Some of these can be made at your kitchen table using only a Dremel and a few basic hand tools
Well, Jordyn, you don’t need a 3-d printer to make a functional weapon.  Some time back, 10 or so acquaintances and I got together in one of the guy’s garages, and we all built AK-47s.  And they are not registered in any way: the law doesn’t require it.
Oh, and by the way, this was 15 years ago.  It’s MUCH easier now: as mentioned, you can build the controlled part of an AR-15 (the “reciever”) with a home CNC Mill. . . .
I see critical analysis of information is excluded from students majoring in digital and print journalism.
The author should take a course in logic, if possible.
It’s such a great opportunity when articles like this are written and allow those truly familiar with 3-D printing (as seen in the majority of the comments) to respond with truth and reason. I guess I don’t have to mention any kid in high school can walk into their shop and create a metal gun using tools for free. We certainly appreciate the publicity and are very grateful we lucked out with such a tremendous positive response. The true epiphany is the epic step forward in manufacturing using powdered metals while yielding results capable of withstanding rigorous testing while maintaining accuracy. Before this gun was printed, only our most secret of customers understood the value in prototyping with metal laser sintering/melting. Now the average person can fully appreciate it. Thanks again from Solid Concepts! (Solid Concepts Marketing Dept.)
The article conflates the DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Sintering, aka 3-D metal printing) and the plastic polymer 3-D printing.
DLMS machines start around half a million dollars.
It’s always has been legal for an individual to use a milling machine or CNC machine and build their own firearm out of metal. Plans for the 1911 and AR-15 are public domain and readily available. As long as the firearm is not transfered such “homebuilts” are legal.
The rules are the same for polymer 3-D firearms.
The question about who can make guns is settled.
Anyone who wants to.
Its pretty obvious that the author of this article did basically no research to support his opinion prior to writing posting  it on the internet (not generally recommended). Making a basic gun, more complex and useful than this printed gun even, is ridiculously simple. It requires, at its simplest, a tube (preferably metal), some sort of spring tension, and a pointed piece of metal to act as a firing pin. That’s literally it. You can do it with duct tape…seriously. Google it.  With a halfway decent machine shop you can make full out machine guns in basically no time flat. Its always been this way. It astounds me to think that people honestly believe that manufacturing basically anything out of scratch is impossible. It just goes to show how comfortable (that is, useless) most people have become. No one has any sort of tangible skills anymore.
You can go to Harbor Freight and for less that $1000 buy all of the tools necessary to build such a gun using standard machines, like lathe, drill press, and milling machine. Maybe the skill level is a bit more, but there was hand fitting required in this last gun also.  So, what is this author attempting to say?
“essentially feels and looks like an actual handgun” WOW, do you think that it feels and looks like an actual handgun because it is an actual handgun.
The editors forgot to read the article before posting the Headline.
Search Google for: “zip gun” instructions.
Be afraid. Be very… wait, people have been making zip guns since like… forever?
Yawn!
This article implies there is something evil, criminal, moral or just cheating the system for a company or individual making a gun. Far from the truth. Guns can be made by anyone for their own personal use. And private enterprise is correct in using any method to manufacture them. Government has no authority to regulate that.
Libtards are COWARDS!  They don’t have the guts to directly persecute the law abiding citizen who is standing up with his God given intelligence to defend himself.  Instead they put the blame on an inanimate tool: guns. If guns didn’t exist there will always be evil on earth and evil will always find out how to use a tool to commit crimes against innocent victims. Solution: root out and remove evil humans from society regardless of race, nationality, sexual preference, political support. That means PROFILING! Profiling CRIMINALS. Stop and frisk gang members. No early release of habitual criminals. No country club type prisons. Hard labor prisons. Execution of heinous crime committers. Seal our Mexico border as tight as Mexico’s Southern border is. These illegals are the least desirable of any aliens we need to allow to enter the U.S.
This author is apparently ignorant of the fact that anyone with a decent machine shop has had the ability to build guns for ages. Where do you think guns came from? The aether?
Search for AR-15 blueprint, for example.
Is there another page to this article?
I ask because I was waiting for the explanation of how 3D gun printing was going “greatly”  to harm the nation, and I didn’t see it.
… and could not speak out against the crown. Then they tried taking away our militia’s guns… look where that led. To suspend anyone’s rights is unacceptable and for our government to so brazenly do so should have ALL American’s up in arms and utterly outraged at this. I agree with many others when they say that our rights are not up for negotiations, this includes the whole of our rights which are not entirely enumerated, and likely never will be. We need to punish the actor’s of crimes, not innocent people because they have one obscure thing in common with a criminal. The Aurora shooter was a redhead, all redheads should be arrested before they commit a mass shooting. Gacy was a professional clown, all clowns need to be locked up before they turn into serial killers. OJ played football, lock up anyone who plays football before they get in a high speed chase and get acquitted for a double murder they probably committed. The Virginia Tech shooter was Asian and a college student, HURRY! How is it so few on the left – who aren’t even necessarily progressives – see the absolute absurdity of this!? It is insane! It will, literally, give the authorities the permission to profile, search, and indefinitely detain anyone they THINK could commit a crime.
So,the author believes that not only should Americans not be able to exercise their Second Amendment rights – “unnecessary prevalence of guns in this country” – but that all First Amendment rights concerning pro-freedom activities with guns should be banned as well? Perhaps all property rights should be laid by the wayside as well? Maybe the author would like it if the police could search anyone, anywhere, for any reason, at any moment as well? Of course, the progressives will say all of this is hyperbole or arguments with no basis, but deep down they know – along with everyone else – that losing rights is a slippery slope when it comes to governmental control. Germany – Hitler disarmed the Jews and then made them submit to searches and then killed them by the thousands. America – we had to submit to taxes, warrantless searches and

The director of California’s Dept. of Fair Employment and Housing, Phyllis Cheng, spoke to USC students Thursday morning in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in a seminar titled “Current Trends in Gender Discrimination and Housing Discrimination.”
Cheng has been serving as the director of DFEH since 2008. She was appointed by then Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and was subsequently confirmed by the California state senate in a unanimous vote. Prior to her work at the department, she earned her Ph.D. from USC and a law degree from Southwestern Law School. As a lawyer, she specialized in civil rights law, working at both private firms and the Civil Rights Enforcement Section of the California Dept. of Justice. In 2012, Cheng was named the Ronald M. George Public Lawyer of the Year.
Cheng spoke to a group of students from the Marshall School of Business, the Price School of Public Policy and the Gould School of Law. She explained how the Dept. of Fair Employment and Housing defends California residents from discrimination against all kinds of factors, including age, race, gender, religion and disability. Recently, Cheng commissioned the UCLA-RAND Center for Law and Public Policy to look at the department’s data for the past decade.
“They found that disability claims grew by 76 percent. Race, national origin and sex discrimination decreased from 25 percent to 39 percent,” she said.
DFEH was established in 1959 and handles discrimination complaints related to employment and housing. The department works with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to enforce both national and state laws. It is the largest state civil rights agency in the country.
Since Cheng has been head of the department, it has seen both a decrease in its budget and an increase in the number of claims it handles every year.
“In terms of budget, we lost money. We used to have $24 million in our budget [in 2007], of which about $5 million is federal funding,” Cheng said. “Everything declined to about $20 million [in 2011].”
She explained that they have had to become more efficient by decreasing their overhead and streamlining the process they use to evaluate and respond to claims.
“I think it’s because we automated our system,” Cheng said. “It must be easier for people to go online and actually file a complaint.”
Cheng said the department saw a sharp increase in complaints in 2012, from about 7,000 to 13,000.
“This almost doubled the number of disability claims,” she said. “So, the system must be very user-friendly.”
One of the biggest ways DFEH has been able to handle the increase in their workload has been through the Educational Partnerships they’ve implemented with the law programs at University of California, Davis, UC Irvine and five other universities in California. DFEH employees teach clinical programs at the partner universities where students can earn course credit and assist with real-world cases.
“Over a 10-week period at Irvine and at Davis, 16 law students, under our supervision, worked 40 hours a week for 10 weeks,” Cheng said of a class-action law suit against Verizon.

Thank you for the excellent coverage in the Daily Trojan.  My only clarification is that, in 2012, disability discrimination claims rose from about about 7,000 to 13,000, but total claims rose from about 19,000 to over 21,000.

Behind an unrivaled resilience on both sides of the ball, the Trojans embodied the ‘one team, one heartbeat’ message that interim head coach Ed Orgeron had been preaching to them all week long leading up to Saturday’s showdown with the No. 4-ranked Stanford Cardinal.
And on one kick, with the game hanging in the balance, tied at 17-17, USC kicker Andre Heidari, who has struggles this season, was able to lift the Trojans (8-3, 5-2 Pac-12) to upset the Cardinal (8-2, 6-2), 20-17 in front of a sold out crowd at the Coliseum that also had a renewed ‘heartbeat’ instilled into it.
Heidari’s 47-yard field goal with just 19 seconds remaining is what ultimately allowed the Trojans to shock a Stanford team that was fresh off an upset of their own when they defeated a No. 3 ranked Oregon team, 26-20.
“I did what I needed to do,” Heidari said. “I’m glad my team put me into the position and that my teammates believed me.”
It was apparent throughout the game, the  ‘GameDay’ hype and electricity that began very early Saturday morning at McCarthy Quad transitioned to the Coliseum, and the Trojans fed off of that energy, defeating Stanford for the first time in five meetings.
Once the clock hit double zeros, thousands of fans paraded the field to celebrate USC’s first victory over a ranked a team since 2011 and  that has been playing inspired football ever since Orgeron took over for the fired Lane Kiffin.
“This was a win for the entire Trojan family,” Orgeron said. “I’m happy for the fans, it’s been a long time coming.”
The Trojans are 5-1 with Orgeron at the helm, spurring up even more conversation that the former defensive line coach could  become the Trojan’s next head football coach.
“Obviously there’s going to be some decisions made here after we play UCLA ,” Orgeron said. “That’s out of my hands.”
Orgeron, who has now led the Trojans to four consecutive wins, could not have been more happy about this win for his team.
“In our tight-knit family, there was a belief that we were going to find a way to win the game,” Orgeron said. “I’m proud of our young men. This is something that they’ve wanted for a long time now.”
On a night when former USC quarterback and Heisman trophy Matt Leinart winner led the Trojans out of the tunnel, red shirt sophomore Cody Kessler looked sharp against a tough Stanford defense. He passed for 288 yards and a touchdown, while completing 25 of his 37 passes.
In the first half, only two of Kessler’s pass attempts were incompletions.
The most important of Kessler’s completions was came on a forth down completion on a slant pass to wide receiver Marquise Lee for 13 yards to continue the Trojan’s drive to win the game with just over a minute remaining in the game. Lee proceeded to hobble off the field following the play, due to what he thought was a bone bruise.
“I knew I was taking a chance, but I looked inside there eyes, and as a coach, I wanted to give the guys a chance to win the game,” Orgeron said in regards to going for it on fourth and two at midfield in that situation. “I had no hesitation at all to go for it.”
The 2012 Biletnikoff winner, who claimed he was back at one hundred percent earlier in the week, had six catches for 83 yards.
“I knew he [Lee] was in pain, but I had trust in him that he was going to be open and I just threw the ball and he was there to make the play,” said Kessler.
Nelson Agholor had another big game, catching eight passes for 104 yards.
When the offense began to struggle in the second half, though, it was the Trojan’s stalwart defense that made the big plays USC needed in order to stay in the game.
After a Kessler fumble in USC territory, the defense had halted the Stanford offense to just a field goal before freshman offensive tackle Chad Wheeler blocked it to keep the game tied at 17-17.
Also, in the fourth quarter, the Cardinal were knocking on the door at the USC six-yard line when on third down, Dion Bailey intercepted Hogan’s pass.
“It was one of the most electrifying atmospheres I have in my four years here,” said Bailey. “This was a great win for the university.”
Later in the fourth with only three minutes left to play, Su’a Cravens would intercept a tipped pass that set up the USC offense for a drive and win the game.
The defense not only limited the Cardinal to just a touchdown in the second half, but held them to their lowest point total of the entire season.
In fact, USC played only 2 defensive subs during the the majority of the  game.
“An outstanding job by Clancy Pendergast [defensive coordinator], Pete Jenkins [defensive line coach], and all of our linebackers for hanging in there toe to toe with the Stanford offensive line,” Orgeron said.
The USC running game, which had been so successful in recent weeks, really struggled to get going as they complied a combined a season-low 23 yards. Javorius ‘Buck’ Allen scored a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the first quarter to give USC a 14-7 lead.
“The whole game was a grind and it could have gone either way at any second,” said Orgeron.
Stanford’s running game, however, was the ‘bread and butter’ of their offense, as they rushed for 210 yards behind their stout offensive line.
The Cardinal’s Tyler Gaffney took 24 carries for 158 yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Kevin Hogan didn’t turn the ball over, but went 14 of 25 for just 127 yards.
Gaffney scored on a 35-yard run in the first quarter to answer Kessler’s one-yard touchdown pass  to full back Soma Vainuku on the Trojan’s first drive of the game.
USC’s win avenges the three past defeats that the Trojans have suffered at the hands of the Cardinal in the Coliseum, including a triple-overtime loss two years ago when Andrew Luck was the Stanford quarterback.
The Trojans not only derailed the Cardinal’s national title aspirations by pulling off the upset, but also kept their own Pac-12 championship and Rose Bowl hopes alive with two games remaining, one of those coming against cross-town rival UCLA.
However, before they match up with the Bruins for what is sure to be another thrilling game at the Coliseum, USC will travel to Boulder, Colo. next Saturday (Nov. 23) to take on the Colorado Buffaloes.
