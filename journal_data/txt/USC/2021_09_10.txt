The Getty Museum is home to a collection of Roman, Greek, Etruscan and European art including paintings, sculptures, drawings, manuscripts, decorative arts and photography dating from as early as the Middle Ages to modern day. 
The following exhibits, “Artists as Collectors,” “Paolo Veneziano: Art and Devotion in 14th-Century Venice” and “Photo Flux: Unshuttering LA” respectively covered artists’ personal collections, a feature on a leading Venetian painter and photography that shatters conventional labels.
Artists as Collectors (May 25 – September 12, 2021)
The “Artists as Collectors” exhibit allowed museum attendees to step into the shoes of famous European painters such as Jonathan Richardson, Sir Thomas Lawrence and Joshua Reynolds who cherished a number of extraordinary drafts from Agostino Caracci, Girolamo Muziano, Delacroix, Raphael, Rembrandt and other prominent artists.
The collection consisted of the featured painters’ favorite pieces, varying from landscapes and depictions of biblical scenes to human profiles in mediums of ink, graphite, watercolor and chalk. 
One illustration titled “A Group of Shepherds, and Other Studies” was an example of the artist practicing sketches — seen in the amount of side profiles of faces without bodies. The former owner, English painter Sir Thomas Lawrence, revered drawings as a great example to develop technical skills. 
To these artists, their collections “were valued as intellectual property, powerful status symbols and works of art in their own right,” according to the exhibition’s web page. Preserving these copies was a sign of good taste, a way to study individual inspiration and simple appreciation of their work. 
Overall, the exhibit was a testament to the artists’ love of their craft. It revealed some artists’ humanity and passion that are easy to forget in the face of their overwhelming talent; however, the lack of color could have come across as either intriguing or dull to visitors.
Paolo Veneziano: Art and Devotion in 14th-Century Venice (July 13 – October 3, 2021) 
“Paolo Veneziano: Art and Devotion in 14th-Century Venice” showcases the Venetian painter’s works, varying in panels of altarpiece ensembles, triptychs and frames. During one of the most historically prosperous times in his country, Paolo Veneziano was known as a prominent personality.
Featuring iconic representations and narrative scenes of Christian figures, said Getty paintings curator Davide Gasparotto in the virtual opening, Veneziano’s pieces ranged “from monumental complexes for public display to small refined objects for personal contemplation, and from ephemeral festive decorations to designs from embroideries and mosaics.”
Experts intentionally rearranged the panels in the exhibition to set the energy of a late medieval Venice against Los Angeles’ modern visual culture — a decision that made the exhibition all the more striking. 
The piece to pay the closest attention to besides the “Triptych” is “The Coronation of the Virgin.” The piece, which Veneziano created along with his son, Giovanni, is considered a cornerstone of the exhibition as it came from the Frick Collection in New York. Although less elaborate in construction, its key accent is the detailed portrayal of Jesus Christ as the sun and Mary the Virgin as the moon (placed under their feet), a detail you could miss without careful examination. 
It is Paolo Veneziano’s last known work, but it is somewhat the most sentimental in the gallery as the colors and tone give off a calming, luminous tone. 
The exhibition of Veneziano’s gold-leafed, sophisticated production from the 14th century offers a good glimpse of the crucial attention to detail his clientele entrusted to his skill in creating priceless, devotional pieces that would stand the test of time. 
Photo Flux: Unshuttering LA (May 25 – October 10, 2021)
“Unshuttering LA” is a collection of pieces from numerous artists breaking the stereotypes placed on people of color. 
“Photography, historically, has been used to pin people of color in a particular location to a particular identity or stereotype, and the artists in this exhibition works to unpin that,” said Getty guest curator Jill Moniz in the New Narratives by LA Photographers of All Ages podcast. “And, to create work as cultural production that speaks to the diversity of their stories.”
A large eye-catcher is the piece “Support Systems” by photographer Todd Gray, which depicts sports as a means of freedom in a society that has suffocated Black men. According to Moniz, the idea of the piece was to invoke the daily confrontations and challenges of character that Black people face. Moniz also said the work was inspired by the anti-Black racism protests during Los Angeles’ 1984 Olympics.  
The gallery serves to express each photographer’s “own aesthetics, identities and narratives,” said Jim Cuno, president of J. Paul Getty Trust. This can also be seen in “May Flowers and After Manet” by Carrie Mae Weems. It depicts an ordinary girl’s profile as a rebellion against portraits traditionally being a sign of wealth and high status in the 19th century. The piece creates a simple, yet, powerful intention: not to primarily criticize society and its former convention, but to demand “an understanding that she is here.” 
If the goal was to “shake the core of photography” as Moniz said, the exhibition’s undisguised spirit clearly granted a refreshing take on who gets to tell your story and why humanity is beautiful since every individual is unique.
Overall, there’s little to complain or frown about the exhibitions; the Getty Center accumulated a variety of rooms, themes and art styles that could appeal to every sort of visitor — whether first-time guest or veteran.

Jimmy Fallon messed up. 
Yes, one of America’s favorite late night hosts dropped the ball when he had Addison Rae teach him eight TikTok dances back in March. Fallon was doing what any late night host would do, following trends to keep up with his audience. 
The problem was that Rae was not the creator of the dances she was teaching. This doesn’t seem like a big deal, I mean the very essence of TikTok is that trends get repeated or performed by different people. Most creators choreograph dances with the intention of their idea being repeated. 
However, the problem is that Addison got a spot on late night TV while the original creators didn’t. Trust me, Fallon received a lot of backlash because of it — just scroll down to the comment section of the YouTtube video. 
One user, Lae Lae, commented “The fact that Addison is on the TONIGHT SHOW for doing dances that she didn’t even create. This is so unfair.”
Agreeing with that sentiment, a user named Nai Nai said, “She isn’t the creator of these dances, the real creators should be up here doing THEIR dances plus she didn’t even credit them for all the work they did!”
These viewers have reason to be angry because this segment on “The Tonight Show” displays the flaws of TikTok’s supposed “dance credit” practice. 
The app has an unspoken rule — if you are doing a dance you didn’t create you have to credit the choreographer by adding “dc: [insert choreographer’s username here].” If someone forgets to add this dance credit, comments canceling the person who failed to shout out the original creator roll in. 
But how effective are these dance credits? I mean seriously; you mean to tell me that every person who sees a dance on their “For You” page clicks on the original creator’s profile? I know I don’t; I scroll aimlessly and quickly through TikTok, attaining whatever small dose of serotonin that I can get. 
Not only that, the intent behind giving original creators credit has been tainted. No one is doing it because they genuinely want to support those creators, they are doing it so they don’t get canceled.
Just like any other TikToker would do, Fallon’s team credited the dance choreographer’s in the YouTube video description. Fallon definitely has a lot of clout, but even that was not enough for those creators to get any opportunities. 
It is TikTokers like Charli D’Amelio, Dixie D’Amelio and Rae who have gained traction from co-opting their dances everyday. They are the ones getting noticed and reaping the benefits. That is, they are the ones receiving brand deals, sponsorships and movie roles (not like “He’s All That” is anything to be proud of, but still). 
As these creators continue to grow their following, the choreographers are left as a username in the comment section of their content. The original choreographers — who are often Black — get lost in the abyss of millions of daily videos. (Side note: If you want to read an amazing piece on the Black creators’ TikTok strike, read Marlize Duncan’s piece from her Daily Trojan column “Hustle and Fro: Quiet ain’t no back tok.”)
In order to settle the backlash he received from Rae’s stint on the show, Fallon invited the original dance creators to visit the show the next night, but, at that point, it was obvious his publicity team was doing damage control. 
Giving credit where it is due shouldn’t be an afterthought, so how can we fix the problem? 
One solution to this problem could be easily undertaken by non-Black creators. Creators choosing to copy a dance should do so by duetting the original video. This feature sets the new and original video side-by-side on a user’s “For You” page. This way, the viewer feels more inclined to go back to the original video and look through that TikToker’s content. 
Another solution is a long shot, but TikTok should add a feature that leads audiences to the original creator in a more eye-catching way. Maybe that creator could be the face of the trending page or TikTok gives a label that says “creator of the viral dance” when people go to the sound. 
In the same way that a company can’t steal a trademark or a student can’t plagiarize their work, there has to be a way for TikTok creators to gain the attention they deserve for their original work. TikTok needs explicit rules, just like YouTtube’s copyrighted music rules. 
Until TikTokers get the recognition they deserve, controversy and backlash are going to continue over who rightly deserves to get noticed in the industry. This will cause a huge struggle for all artists, not just TikTokers, to gain credit for their original work.

Being confined to our childhood bedrooms during the coronavirus pandemic brought a lot of us back to hobbies we enjoyed when we were younger. After re-reading the slew of series I loved in my childhood an inordinate amount of times  — I’m looking at you “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” and “The Hunger Games” — I realized I needed to broaden my horizons. With the help of #BookTok — a TikTok hashtag where avid readers review and share their favorite reads with the masses — I’ve found some new books for all of us who have rekindled our love of reading. 
“We Were Liars” by E. Lockhart
Deceit, drama and suspense. “We Were Liars” has it all. Lockhart weaves together an enthralling tale about the deceptively perfect and wealthy Sinclair family in this novel. Centered on a group of friends, called “the Liars,” Lockhart leaves just enough of the story out of reach to keep you guessing. “We Were Liars” is full of twists and turns sure to keep you entertained until the very last page. 
“The Song of Achilles” by Madeline Miller
Ever read the “Percy Jackson” series in middle school and thought you were the authority on Greek mythology? Then this one’s for you. Think of “Song of Achilles” as the series’ older cousin. Madeline Miller artfully retells the story of the Trojan War with a focus on the relationship between Achilles and his confidant Patroclus. The story is told through the eyes of Patroclus rather than Achilles and provides a riveting recount of the Trojan War from a perspective not many are familiar with. Oh, and fair warning, have your box of tissues ready — this one’s a tearjerker. 
“Shadow and Bone” by Leigh Bardugo
For a fantastical escape from the drab day-to-day life of assignments, deadlines and obligations, pick up Leigh Bardugo’s “Shadow and Bone.” Narrated by a teenage orphan named Alina Starkov who grew up in the fictional land of Ravka, the novel is a fun escape from reality. Her relationships with characters such as the Darkling and her struggles to fit in ground the story and allow it to remain a relatable narrative in spite of its fantastical nature. Prepare for your school work to be pushed to the back burner as you binge the book series and its Netflix adaptation. 
“It Ends With Us” by Colleen Hoover
If you’re looking for something that will break your heart into pieces and then put it back together, Colleen Hoover has just the right book for you. The novel chronicles Lily Bloom’s relationship with the seemingly perfect Ryle Kincaid. Everything is smooth sailing until her first love, Atlas Corrigan, comes back into the picture. A thoughtful reflection on the cyclical nature of abuse and its horrors, “It Ends with Us” is a compelling read from start to finish. 
“They Both Die at the End” by Adam Silvera
OK, try not to be scared off by the title because this book is worth every tear you might shed while reading it. The wonderfully heart-wrenching, “They Both Die at the End,” paints the picture of a society where people are given a notification when they reach the last 24 hours (or less) of their life. Our protagonists, Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio, meet through an app called “Last Friend” which allows people to make new friends on their “End Day.” Mateo and Rufus make the best of their “End Day” together, doing everything they were too scared to do during the rest of their lives and finally living freely. Make sure to have a happier novel queued up after you finish this one, trust me. 
“All the Bright Places” by Jennifer Niven
In the small town of Bartlett, Ind., two teenagers, Theodore Finch and Violet Markey, seek more than what the town has to offer. Paired together for a school project, the two travel the state of Indiana together and fall in love. Niven artfully switches between the perspectives of both teens, allowing us a glimpse into their thoughts and emotions in a way that allows you to truly resonate with the characters. The dynamic between these perfect narrative foils will captivate you from beginning to end. 
“Monday’s Not Coming” by Tiffany D. Jackson
Tiffany D. Jackson’s “Monday’s Not Coming” uses an unconventional and disorienting narrative structure to examine racial issues, mental illness and bias in the media. The disappearance of Black girls across the United States was the catalyst for the book as our protagonist, Claudia Coleman, searches for her best friend Monday Charles who has been missing for a year. The twist in the novel is a shock and throws readers for a loop. One of the more socially relevant novels on this list, “Monday’s Not Coming” is a vital read for anyone who wants to be more aware of the neglect of Black women by modern society. 
“One of Us Is Lying” by Karen M. McManus
Another suspenseful read, Karen M. McManus’ debut novel employs the use of multiple points of view to great effect. Bayview High was the site of the murder of Simon, a student who ran a gossip page about his peers. As we flip through the perspectives of the four suspects of Simon’s murder, we get closer to the truth and learn just how much everybody has to lose. This book will keep you on your toes, so clear your calendar and get ready to read all 368 pages in one sitting. 
“The Book Thief” by Markus Zusak
You might recognize this one. Zusak’s novel is set in the year 1931 while the Nazis still occupied Germany. The protagonist, Liesel Meminger, has an insatiable love of books — one so great she is willing to risk life-and-limb to learn to read. The narration of the novel by Death is a haunting and effective literary tool that emphasizes to readers the horrors of the Holocaust. “The Book Thief” is the perfect way to close out this list — and the perfect narrative to demonstrate just how important literature is.

While recent Trojans might remember the Stanford game as the place where a star was born; then freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis took on the starting job and almost single-handedly revived hopes for the 2019 season in a 45-20 win, the bad blood between the Cardinal and Trojans has existed long prior. 
As USC’s oldest current rival (dating back to 1905) and the only other private school in the Pac-12, the two teams have clashed time and time again, leading to iconic moments, unexpected comebacks and a rivalry including fans, players and coaches.
“I think it’s been a rivalry that’s been dominated by USC most of the time, but there have been pockets of time when Stanford’s been very competitive and been a very worthy opponent,” said Jeff Fellenzer, an associate professor of professional practice specializing in sports, business and media at Annenberg.  
The rivalry has led to moments such as the 1980 game at Stanford, where the Stanford band had a Trojan-helmeted human skeleton riding a horse’s skeleton in a mockery of Traveler during halftime. In a more recent instance in 2012, the Stanford band leader showed up dressed as the Trojan mascot. 
With USC dominating the series with a 63-33-3 lead, here is a look at some classic moments during the rivalry before Saturday’s game as the Trojans’ face their rival Stanford in their first Pac-12 matchup of the season. 
The “Vow Boys” & the beginning of a rivalry
The rivalry truly took a turn with the “Vow Boys” in 1932. Stanford had just lost to USC 13-0 when freshman quarterback Frank Alustiza and freshman fullback Bobby Grayson made a vow that they would “never lose to the Trojans.” They kept true to their promise and went on to win three years in a row against USC — who had previously been on a 27-game win streak. The “Vow Boys” went to the Rose Bowl three consecutive seasons finally culminating in a Rose Bowl win their final year.   
The “Wild Bunch” and an unexpected comeback in 1969
1969 was the year of the notorious USC defensive line monikered the “Wild Bunch.” The Trojans finished 10-0-1, coming off a 1967 national title and a 1968 Rose Bowl loss to Oregon State. Led by Black quarterback Jimmy Jones and an all-Black defensive line — rare at the time — and under head coach John McKay, the Trojans would go on to defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Their impressive record didn’t come easy and involved an unexpected comeback against Stanford. 
The Stanford offense was led by junior quarterback Jim Plunkett (who would go on to become the first Mexican American Heisman winner the following season) and had a 12-0 lead going into the second quarter. 
Going into halftime, USC was barely ahead at 14-12 when Stanford scored a field goal with three minutes left in the game, going up 24-23. In what was an unexpected comeback, the Trojans stole the victory with a Ron Ayala field goal as time ran out. It was set up by a conversion on 4th and 5 at USC’s own 20 with no timeouts after a run by tailback Clarence Davis. The Trojans ended up with a 26-24 win. 
Stanford strikes back at the 2007 game
In another close call and revenge for a 42-0 loss the previous year, the Cardinal defeated the Trojans 24-23. Entering the game, ranked No. 2 in the AP poll, USC was a 41-point favorite and had a 35-game home winning streak. It was Jim Harbaugh’s first season as Stanford head coach; he and USC head coach Pete Carroll would go on to have an intense rivalry.  
The upset was secured with a 10-yard touchdown pass from redshirt sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard to wide receiver Mark Bradford with 49 seconds remaining in the game to put the Cardinal ahead. To add insult to injury, Bradford attended high school at Fremont High School in Los Angeles. 
“It was someone who came back to kind of haunt USC from L.A.,” Fellenzer said. “That was Jim Harbaugh’s first season as coach. So, at that point he built the program up. But the very first year, they have this epic comeback.” 
“What’s your deal?” and Stanford’s demolition of 2009
In what would become an infamous game and the highest margin of loss against Stanford, the Cardinal defeated the Trojans 55-21 in 2009. It was USC’s worst loss in the Coliseum in 43 years and took place during Homecoming with a crowd of 90,071 in attendance.  
With a 48-21 lead in the fourth quarter, Harbaugh attempted a two-point conversion attempt drawing ire from the crowd. This led to a heated exchange between Harbaugh and Carroll during the traditional handshake between the coaches at the end of the game with Carroll asking Harbaugh, “What’s your deal?” and Harbaugh replying with “What’s your deal?” The slogan would go on to become Stanford’s phrase for it’s season ticket packages. 
Stanford tailback Toby Gerhart rushed for 178 yards and three touchdowns in the win. An All-American and 2009 Heisman Trophy runner up who was drafted in the second round by the Minnesota Vikings, Gerhart was heavily recruited out of high school and turned down the Trojans’ offer of playing fullback or linebacker.   
Rounding up into the present
Other notable games between the two teams include the 1979 game when Stanford tied USC 21-21. With last-minutes comebacks and a couple of close one-point games, including Stanford defeating USC 13-12 in 1926, 24-23 in 2007 and USC winning 31-30 in 1995, there is no knowing which team will pull off the win. 
The Trojans will look to maintain their winning streak from 2019 and replicate Slovis’ success against Stanford going into Saturday’s game. The Trojans’ are 17-point favorites, but if history has shown anything, the game might be too close for comfort.

After canceling on-campus tailgates and other gameday activities for the season-opener against San Jose State last week, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced the University will allow tailgating on campus for this weekend’s game against Stanford. After consulting medical experts, the University will set restrictions such as limited tailgating capacity and Trojan Check on Saturday to ensure the safety of the community. 
Campus tailgating density will be reduced to approximately 25% of normal game day crowds. Only those who have applied and been approved through the USC’s tailgating reservation system will be allowed to participate in pregame activities on game day. Those not part of a registered tailgate cannot host events on campus.
With kickoff at 7:30 p.m., campus will open at 1:30 p.m. — any tailgating activities before then are prohibited. To get on campus, all guests must complete Trojan Check. Additionally, depending on whether they are attending the game or a tailgate, visitors will have to provide proof they are part of a permitted tailgate or have a valid ticket to the game. 
Members of the USC community such as students, staff and faculty can access campus by completing Trojan Check. Pregame activities off-campus at the Coliseum or Exposition Park can continue as planned. 
Face coverings are required both on campus and at the Coliseum. They can only be taken off while actively consuming food or beverages. 
The University also recommends guests prepare ahead of time due to the possibility of longer wait times to get into campus on game day. 
USC announced Saturday’s game will be Joint Forces Day at the Coliseum in honor of the 20th anniversary of 9/11. The Trojans will have a pregame ceremony for the anniversary, with over 5,000 service members and first responders in attendance.

For the first time since 1945, Stanford and No. 14 USC did not play each other in the 2020 football season. The storied rivals will be back in action for their 101st matchup in week two as the Trojans look to start 2-0. 
The two teams had completely opposite starts to the 2021 season. Stanford, routed by Kansas State 24-7, scored its only touchdown in the twilight moments of the fourth quarter. USC took down San Jose State 30-7. 
For head coach Clay Helton, last week doesn’t matter. In a media briefing Tuesday during practice, Helton said he knows what to expect when the Trojans line up against head coach David Shaw and Stanford.
“It’s one of those physicalmatchups everytime you play them,” Helton said. “Extremely well coached, extremely well disciplined.” 
Shaw announcing sophomore quarterback Tanner McKee as the starter is the biggest headline coming into this weekend. The Corona, Calif. resident McKee will make his first career start in a homecoming game after splitting last week’s snaps with senior Jack West. 
McKee was a highly touted quarterback out of high school, ranked the fourth quarterback in his class according to 24/7 Sports. In 2017, McKee was behind Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields and a player USC fans know well, JT Daniels. After a two-year Latter-day Saints mission in Brazil, the fourth player in one of the best QB recruiting classes in recent history will get his chance to start. 
With McKee’s collegiate debut lurking, both Helton and defensive coordinator Todd Orlando are focused on the physical Stanford run game before they worry about the new signal caller from Centennial High School.
“To have Austin Jones and E.J. Smith in the backfield, those are two dangerous weapons,” Helton said. “Something that we are really going to have to focus on and something that was a success for Kansas St. last week and probably was the difference in the game.” 
Orlando has always been a big believer in being the more physical and aggressive team week in and week out. For week two against Stanford, Orlando, during practice Wednesday, said he is excited to see how the Trojans square off against a downhill run game. 
“I think this game is going to be a great test for us,” Orlando said. “They are going to line up and run the football. They are going to be in personnel groupings that our guys haven’t seen. I am excited about that.” 
On the offensive end for the Trojans, freshmen tackles Courtland Ford and Jonah Monheim will be critical for USC to have a chance. While Stanford’s offense sputtered against Kansas St., the defense held the Wildcats to just 14 points through the first three quarters and got to senior quarterback Skylar Thompson three times. 
“I thought they did a nice job last week of putting pressure on the quarterback with three sacks,” Helton said. “Our offensive line is up for a big task this week with that defensive front.” 
For USC to win, it will need to tackle in space well. Stanford loves to spread its offensive personnel out and run the football up the middle, often leaving linebackers one-on-one with running backs. The Trojans cannot miss tackles and allow big yardage plays, something that hurt them in SJSU’s only touchdown drive a week ago. Orlando preaches swarming the football and, if the Trojans do so, they should be able to make Stanford’s offense one-dimensional and put the pressure on McKee.
For Stanford to complete theupset, the Cardinal will have to force turnovers and establish the run game. With a new starting quarterback, Stanford does not want to rely heavily on McKee to carry them at a packed Coliseum. The nerves will be high for the sophomore, and we’ll see if the running game can calm them. 
On the defensive side, the Cardinal have a terrific secondary led by junior cornerback Kyu Blu Kelly who was named to the Pro Football Focus Team of the Week for his interception last week. If the disciplined Stanford secondary can cause junior quarterback Kedon Slovis problems by disrupting the rhythm of the offense and causing turnovers, they might have a chance against USC. 
The quarterback battle between McKee and Slovis is the matchup to watch. The two quarterbacks had nearly opposite routes as college football starters, with Slovis coming in as a three-star and McKee atop-four player in his class. However, there is one common denominator. Slovis’ first career start was week two at the Coliseum in 2019 against Stanford and McKee’s first career start will be in week two this Saturday night in the 101st rendition of USC vs. Stanford. It’ll be interesting to see the Southern California local and high school phenom go toe-to-toe with the Heisman hopeful Slovis.   
For Helton, a Stanford game early in the season is always a benchmark for where the team is at. He said Saturday night’s matchup is no different.
“This has really become a big rivalry game,” Helton said. “It’s one of those games that really sets the tone for the rest of the season.”

Former three-time All-American fullback, College Football Hall of Famer and USC legend Sam “Bam” Cunningham died Tuesday at his home in Inglewood, Calif. at the age of 71.
Most remember Cunningham for his role in USC’s 1970 victory against Alabama, and as one of the most influential athletes in college football.
The legendary fullback is best known for his efforts toward college football schools in the South, especially after the famous 42-21 USC victory over an all-white Alabama team in 1970. 
Many credit his two-touchdown, 135-rushing-yard performance against the Crimson Tide as a crucial reason former Alabama head coach Bear Bryant began recruiting Black players. The following season, Alabama fielded their first Black player ever.
“It was a great game for us as Trojans,” said Cunningham in 2018 on a Daily Trojan podcast released on the 50-year anniversary of the historic game. “As bad as it was for Alabama, it was a great game for them because they benefited down the line and have been benefiting ever since — Auburn, all the teams in the SEC, Georgia and all them. To get an opportunity to be a part of something so special is definitely a blessing.”
Cunningham was one of three Black players in the 1970 USC team’s starting lineup. 
As a fullback, Cunningham ran for 1,579 yards and 23 touchdowns and caught 34 passes for two touchdowns in his three-season career.​​ His four-touchdown performance in the 1973 Rose Bowl also earned him Player of the Game honors. 
He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. 
A guest for more than 10 years in Annenberg Professor Jeff Fellenzer’s class, Cunningham would always use his time to tell the story of the 1970 game. His impact will forever be felt by the people closest to him.
“He was a prince of a man,” Fellenzer said. “Always so humble, selfless, never seeking attention for his accomplishments… Always grateful for the opportunities that he had at USC.”
A grateful giant, Fellenzer emphasized how willing Cunnigham was to spend time with students.
“I think he resonated with my students because they recognized how grounded he was and humble,” Fellenzer said.
After USC, the Santa Barbara native was drafted 11th overall by the New England Patriots in the 1973 NFL Draft. After over nine seasons, Cunningham became the franchise’s all-time leading rusher. He was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2010. 
Trojans past and present across social media shared their messageshonoring Cunningham.
Mike Bohn, USC Athletic Director, tweeted: I am deeply saddened for the Cunningham Family and the Trojan Family today. We lost a true legend. #FightOnForever
Matt Leinart, former USC quarterback, tweeted: Sam Cunningham was one of the all timers.  Not just a great football player but an incredible man. Really had a huge influence on my team at USC.  Loved when I got to see him.  RIP to a legend. #FightOnForever
“[For] the Trojan family and college football to lose a legend like Sam Cunningham is a very sad, sad deal,” said head coach Clay Helton during practice Tuesday. “[He was] a legend of the game and a legend of a man.”

The USC community is not experiencing the coronavirus surge that many health officials warned of at the start of the fall semester, USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said Thursday at a student health briefing. 
Of the record 37,243 tests administered last week, 130 students and 13 employees tested positive for the coronavirus. Cases declined this week among students and increased among employees, according to data uploaded by the USC COVID-19 Dashboard. 
The positivity rate among students this week was 0.36% — a drop from the previous positivity of 0.47% reported last week. For employees, however, the positivity rate grew slightly to 0.9% from 0.7%. 
Van Orman said the University is headed in the right direction in the fight against the pandemic. 
“This week we are running at 0.3% [positivity], which is very good news, and this [two to three week period into the semester] was the period that we were concerned about in terms of vulnerability,” Van Orman said.  
Van Orman emphasized that the improving trends on campus are due to the mitigation efforts aggressively implemented by the University — coupled with declining coronavirus prevalence within the greater Los Angeles community. 
“The aggressive mitigation efforts [like] masking, testing, restrictions, Trojan Check were all designed to keep us from having a surge,” Van Orman said. “The other thing that is interesting is the relationship [between coronavirus case counts on campus] to the community rates.” 
According to metrics posted on L.A. County’s Public Health website, the average seven-day test positivity rate is 1.87%. While that rate is higher than the one seen on campus, it is considerably lower than the 6% rate that peaked at the beginning of August. 
“Cases in L.A. have actually plateaued and may be starting to turn around,” Van Orman said. “It’s good, it’s very good news, so I think that’s kind of exactly what we wanted to see.” 
Despite the improving trends seen within USC’s campus community, Van Orman said the University is still experiencing higher positivity rates compared to those seen in April and May. Moreover, Van Orman does not believe that now is the time to scale back preventive measures. 
“We want to reduce the mitigation efforts, and that’s important, but we also want to do it at the right time,” Van Orman said. “We will have another week or two of data to determine in particular whether we need to keep up with the current mitigation efforts.”
Van Orman commended the student body for its cooperation and vigilance in combating the delta-induced coronavirus surge that is still ravaging some parts of the country. 
“We’ve seen very strong responses from students in terms of their behavior, strong compliance with testing, strong compliance with mask-wearing, so students have been very good with behavior,” Van Orman said. 
In response to concerns that a new wave of infections could stem from the season-opening football game last Saturday, Van Orman said “we could be OK.” 
“We had a lot of people gathering and potentially spreading, but if there weren’t a lot of cases, we might not see a lot of spread,” Van Orman said. “It kind of depends on what the prevalence was at the game, and if we really were on a down curve, we could be fine with the game.” 
As of Thursday, Van Orman said she is not aware of any students that have been formally disciplined for fraudulently presenting ​​their daily Trojan Check wellness assessment. In an effort to enhance enforcement efforts, Van Orman said the Care Crew will be scanning all QR codes, instead of waving people through the gates of campus. 
Van Orman implored the student body to return to the fundamental question of why the University is enforcing the health protocol, which is designed to keep students and faculty safe.
“From my perspective, I’d like to think that we don’t have to enforce this with any student — that if you’re a Trojan and you’re a part of our community — you understand why we’re doing this,” Van Orman said. “It’s really not about ways to subvert the system, it’s finding ways to understand why those systems are in place.” 
Additionally, Van Orman said students who suffer from chronic illnesses that are unrelated to the coronavirus should be evaluated by a medical professional and submit clearance to Student Health to remain in compliance with Trojan Check. 
While health officials are relieved with indications that the current coronavirus surge is retreating, concerns continue to grow with new and more problematic variants emerging from around the world. 
On Sept. 2, the World Health Organization added the mu strain to the list of “variants of interests” due to preliminary evidence that it could evade vaccine protection. The new variant has been detected in 49 states, including California.
Van Orman highlighted that the delta variant remains the most dominant strain among USC positive samples, but acknowledges that the emergence of new strains is a genuine source of concern. 
“We do believe that we’re on the other side of this delta peak, and so the question of other variants will become very important over the next couple of weeks — including the mu [variant,”] Van Orman said. 
Meanwhile, Van Orman cited high vaccination rates, particularly increasing rates among international students, in why she is optimistic about coronavirus cases on campus in the weeks ahead.
“We want to keep heading in this direction because if we keep heading in that direction, that means the ability to relax all these [restrictions], but a lot of why we’re in where we are now is because of everything we had in place, so it’s good news,” Van Orman said.

Every morning at campus intersections, like McClintock and Jefferson, students bustle across the street with their heads down, rapidly typing their myUSC credentials on their phone or pulling up a screenshot to display the uniquely colored QR code to USC Care Crew workers. Since returning to campus, students have been required to complete Trojan Check, the daily coronavirus compliance survey, to enter campus. 
Starting with the header of the survey, “Do you currently have any of the following symptoms,” students answer yes or no to a series of symptoms, such as a fever of 100 degrees or higher and loss of taste or smell. Students and on-site employees are also required to comply with a weekly coronavirus test — twice weekly for unvaccinated individuals with medical or religious vaccination exemptions —  and to complete the health and safety course, “Hygiene, Health and Safety,” on TrojanLearn.
But some USC students have found ways to get around the University’s Trojan Check system. 
When opening the Trojan Check app, users are presented with two options: log in with their USC NetID or fill out a guest pass, the latter which does not require a completed coronavirus test, either of the courses, or a full vaccination dosage. While guest passes are intended for non-USC visitors, some students have used the pass when non-compliant with Trojan Check and have gained access to campus. 
A student who wished to remain anonymous out of fear of disciplinary action said he found difficulty arranging time to get a coronavirus test because of long queues.
“I used the guest pass method,” he said. “I know a lot of people use it that way because they have interviews and things like that and waiting in line for like two or three hours is a huge commitment.”
The senior said he and his peers have not received any disciplinary action for showing a guest pass. 
“[Staff have] asked them ‘May I ask why you are using a guest pass?’ And that’s it,” the student said. “I’ve had a friend just say ‘because I’m visiting’… It’s not really a great system.”
In light of the student workarounds of campus coronavirus guidelines, the University looks to increase Trojan Check enforcement at campus entrance stations but are concerned about creating holdups, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a media briefing Sept. 2. 
“It’s always a balance with the Trojan Check. The people at the gates don’t want to create long lines and backups,” Van Orman said. “They want to try to trust people so we can have a better experience, but we also know it’s important that it’s enforced.”
A sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, who wished to remain anonymous because of concerns of disciplinary action for disregarding coronavirus protocols, used another student’s pass to get onto campus the week before classes began. When trying to complete Trojan Check at the crosswalk before the entrance, she found out she was unable to get a pass.
“I didn’t know you needed the [health and safety module] requirement,” they said. “I asked [another student that was crossing] if I could just use a screenshot of theirs because [the staff] weren’t scanning. They were just kind of looking at the color.”
Her plan worked and she got onto campus. However, the sophomore said USC could take further measures to prevent students from entering campus without a valid pass, such as  looking at students’ Trojan Check before they enter classrooms. According to school updates acquired by the Daily Trojan, the Gould School of Law and Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry implemented policies to screen each student as they enter the building, but the majority of schools rely on accurate screenings at the campus entrances. 
“I think [checking at classroom doors] would be easier to see whether or not the students in the class actually have a real Trojan Check, than to just check at the entrance where you could swim around everyone to not scan or just use somebody else’s [pass], or the guest pass,” the student said.
The first student said USC should focus on shortening testing lines by adding additional times during the weekend, so students are less likely to put off testing because of a lack of time. 
“You have class, you have recruiting season, you have a bunch of things going on in the students’ lives and having [the majority of testing] during the week during shop hours is really inconvenient,” he said. “I know a lot of people who just have been skipping their weekly test just to avoid that clash.”
Students with fraudulent Trojan Checks are in violation of the student conduct code regarding coronavirus public health measures and are subject to disciplinary action, Van Orman said.
“I’d like to think that we don’t have to enforce this with any students — that if you’re a Trojan, and you are a part of our community — you understand why we’re doing this,” Van Orman said during another media briefing Thursday. “It’s really not about finding ways to subvert the system, it’s finding ways to understand why those systems are in place.”

Ever since her childhood as a constituent to then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, Sydney Brown looked up to the Democratic leader’s “progressive policies” — including his expansion of healthcare and his early support for gay marriage. Now, Brown spends the majority of her time registering local voters and attending anti-recall rallies in light of the upcoming recall election against the California Governor.
There are 46 candidates running to replace Newsom, including reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, conservative talk show host Larry Elder and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. In March, 1.7 million voters signed a petition to recall Newsom, meeting the state’s threshold needed to bring about a recall election. Many were motivated by anger towards the Governor for mandating mask wearing and imposing quarantines during the coronavirus pandemic. 
According to the State Finance Department, the recall will cost California taxpayers approximately $276 million. If Senator Dianne Feinstein cannot continue to serve in the United States Senate before the winner of the next gubernatorial election enters office in 2023, the winner of the recall would also be the one to appoint her replacement. 
Brown, who serves as president of the Trojan Democrats, organized events and ran weekly phone banks with Grassroots Democrats HQ since returning to school alongside fellow Trojan Democrats Sasha Hussain, Devin Martin and Nam Nguyen. The students also worked closely with the Stop the Republican Recall Campaign and the California Democratic Party to mobilize voters in support of Newsom before the Sept. 14 voting deadline. 
Brown believes the recall election would create a “massive step backwards” for the historically “stalwart progressive state” of California.
“If Governor Newsom is recalled, instead of moving a country in the right direction, and being that source of inspiration for other communities across America, we’re going to move in the backwards direction on literally every single issue,” said Brown, a junior majoring in political science. “On civil rights, gay rights, women’s rights, climate change, economic stimulus pushes — on any given issue — we’re gonna move back and lose decades and decades of progress. That’s gonna hurt millions and millions of people in our state.”
Brown said Elder, one of the more prominent candidates in the election, promotes policies and beliefs she finds “scary” as an African American woman. Brown said she was particularly troubled by the Republican candidate’s past comments that Black people “exaggerate the significance of racism,” that women “exaggerate cases of domestic violence and cases of sexism” and that women workers become less valuable employees when they have children. 
“[Elder] is somebody that believes that women are not as smart as men when it comes to politics and economics. That is something that he actually said. As a woman — especially a woman of color, studying politics — that is not okay,” Brown said. “Someone who’s going to potentially be put in a place of leadership in California is going to be someone who wouldn’t see me on the same level — at the very fundamental basic human rights level — as he would see himself. I think that that is heartbreaking.” 
On Thursday, Brown and the Trojan Democrats hosted a student roundtable with California First Lady Jennifer Seibel Newsom. The USC College Republicans also plan to participate in a local recall event at the DoubleTree Hilton Hotel at the Ontario Airport from Sept. 10-12. According to the USC GOP’s website, volunteers will receive free room, board and drinks in return for assisting officials with campaign activities. The USC GOP did not respond to multiple interview requests from the Daily Trojan.
To engage with USC community members about the upcoming recall election, the Center for Political Future hosted the virtual event “To Recall or Not? Assessing the Campaign to Recall Gavin Newsom” on Sept. 1. CPF Co-Directors Bob Shrum and Mike Murphy moderated the discussion, which featured panelists Jennifer Cryer, assistant professor of political science and international relations; Carla Marinucci, senior writer for POLITICO’s California Playbook; Seema Mehta, a political writer for the Los Angeles Times; and Roger Salazar, a political strategist.
Murphy, a former consultant for prominent Republican politicians — including former Arizona Senator and Presidential Nominee John McCain and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush — reflected on his time as a senior strategist for former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s gubernatorial recall election in 2003, in which Schwarzenegger ousted Democrat Gray Davis with 48.6% of the vote.  
Murphy said he believed there were valid reasons to recall Newsom, such as the California Employment Development Department’s 2020 corruption scandal involving tens of billions of dollars lost to fraudulent unemployment claims filed during the pandemic. 
“If you’re not a progressive Democrat … there’s a lot to be upset about. This is a ‘big tax, big spend’ state. Those of us on the right don’t believe that’s best for the state or the people in it. There’s this unbelievable scandal at the EDD — [$31] billion in fraud — and the Governor’s spoken about that for maybe two paragraphs,” Murphy said. “That’s a pretty legit critique of him from the right. I think there are gonna be conservative [Decline to State] voters who vote against him on that — not only on [the coronavirus].” 
Although he voted for Kevin Faulconer, Murphy said he did not expect a successful outcome for any of the Republican candidates because of the small number of conservative voters in the state. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, CPF Executive Director Kambiz Akhavan, said he felt that political polarization has played a strong role in the recall election. 
“Polarization is making people who want the governor out very motivated. They listen to their friends, their social circles — their media is telling them he’s doing a bad job, and they believe it, and they want to get him out,” Akhavan said.
Akhavan also said the decline in “places where people congregate physically,” such as churches, retail malls, concerts and unions contributes to polarization.
“There’s less opportunity for interaction, more opportunity for division. It’s really pushing us apart,” Akhavan said. 
Brown also shared concerns about political division: “Everything we see in the news is about polarization … There’s a lot of really extreme opinions being felt by everyone right now. I feel like it’s really impacting this election.” 
“I think hosting perhaps meetings with groups like [the Trojan Democrats] and the USC GOP is the first step towards really understanding the other side of the aisle, seeing where they’re coming from, why they might hold the views that they do,” Brown said. “From there, we can go on and have a more productive and kind of dialogue, as opposed to something that is a bit volatile.”

It was a tough weekend for the women’s volleyball team, who dropped two of three games Saturday in the Bluegrass Battle in Lexington, KY. The Trojans were able to sweep Northern Iowa 3-0 on Friday before suffering back-to-back losses to Creighton and Kentucky. USC handled the Panthers 26-24, 25-20, 25-12 and now sit at 3-3 overall.
The Trojans’ next opponent will take them to Honolulu, where they will face Hawaii in back-to-back games over the weekend. The matchup is featured as the “Outrigger Volleyball Series.” 
Hawaii started off its season 2-4, having lost to, Utah Valley, San Diego and Utah. However, the Rainbow Warriors boasted a 3-0 sweep against Texas A&M. 
Unlike the Trojans, Hawaii’s 2020 volleyball season was canceled by its conference, the Big West. The last game the Rainbow Warriors played before this season was a three-set NCAA Tournament loss against Nebraska during the round of 16 in Dec. 2019.
The last time the Trojans played Hawaii was five years ago in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament, where the Rainbow Warriors won a five-set thriller by a score of 25-22, 25-20, 22-25, 16-25, 15-13. Hawaii was ranked no. 12 at the time.
Freshman setter Mia Tuaniga is proving herself to be an important rotation piece off the bench for USC, and has a lethal serve that can swing the momentum of a set with one touch. Against the Panthers alone, Tuaniga tallied four service aces and has totaled seven so far this season.
Senior setter Raquel Lazaro has also been on a tear, recording the team’s first double-double of the season against Northern Iowa. She finished the game with 23 assists, 11 digs, three blocks and one service ace. Lazaro currently leads the team in assists with 111, and her impact on the Trojans’ success is not lost on her teammates.
“Raquel is a little ray of sunshine,” senior captain outside hitter Brooke Botkin said. “She brings a sense of calmness when things are kind of shaky. She brings a lot of energy to the court. When we lose a couple points, she’s there to pick us up. She brings a lot of energy to the team, and I think it really helps us.”
Despite the two crushing defeats in the Bluegrass Battle, Botkin also shined as per usual, leading the Trojans in kills in all three games. Throughout the weekend, Botkin tallied 48 total kills and had 24 against UNI alone.
“Brooke is phenomenal,” Keller said. “She’s decided to buy all in, and she’s one of the hardest working kids in there. She never complains. She’s a badass. We need that here, and she’s going to be a really important part of what we’re doing.”
Although this is his first meeting against Hawaii as the head coach of the Trojans, Keller is no stranger to the Rainbow Warriors. In 2019, when Keller was an assistant coach for UCLA, the two teams squared off in Honolulu. Hawaii swept the Bruins in three sets by a score of 25-15, 25-22, 25-23.
For the Rainbow Warriors, redshirt senior outside hitter Brooke Van Sickle will look to continue her stellar season in the matchup against the Trojans. Van Sickle currently leads the team with 92 kills and 11 service aces.
The first game against Hawaii will tip off on Friday and the second on Saturday. Both games will start at 10 p.m.

After dominant wins last weekend, No. 2 USC will face No. 10 Pepperdine Saturday. The Trojans will also participate in the Inland Empire Classic in Claremont Sunday.
The Trojans had high expectations heading into this season after reaching the NCAA championship last year and being ranked No. 2  in the preseason poll. They opened up their season last Saturday with an exhibition match against West Valley College, winning the game 27-9. The official season-opener occurred later that day against La Verne, where the Trojans saw 14 different players get on the scoresheet in a 28-5 win. 
Since 1979, USC has faced Pepperdine 88 times, with a record of 66-20-2 against the Waves. The two teams clashed earlier this year, as the Trojans earned a 13-7 win at Uytengsu. So far, Pepperdine holds a 3-1 record with wins against California Baptist, Biola and Occidental, with their lone loss coming at the hands of No. 8 UCSD. 
“It’s going to be very exciting to see how we will integrate everybody because we did play last season and made it to the NCAA final without many of our key players,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “We will see how [those] key players will be integrated starting tomorrow.”
The Trojans will face Occidental and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in the Inland Empire Classic — the two teams holding a combined record of 2-6 after their first few games. USC has only played Occidental three other times in its history, winning all three meetings. The Trojans have a more familiarity with Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and are 16-0 in their history against the Stags. 
The Trojans have been able to keep together the majority of the team from last year, with only two players leaving from the previous season’s NCAA tournament roster. Seniors like driver Jacob Mercep, utility Alexander Lansill, goalkeeper Nic Porter and 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt will guide the rest of the team with their experience. 
“There’s a lot of leaders on this team right now and coming from last season we learned so much,” Ehrhardt said. “In that final loss we learned how much we needed to prepare more, and, going from that season, we’ve really tried to implement our new guys even quicker than last season, so they’re going to be a much bigger part of this team.” 
Porter, one of the vocal leaders on the team, had a great showing last week, saving seven shots in two periods of action. He has the ninth-most career saves in USC history and will look to continue his dominant play in goal for the rest of the season. 
It’s very important for our team chemistry to have so many familiar faces,” Porter said. “We all know each other’s game really well, and I think that’s something we can use to our advantage throughout the season.”
USC’s ambition for this season is to make a title run, which it last accomplished in 2018. 
“We’re gonna have a team that really knows what they want early on, and we’re gonna see that this weekend,” Ehrhardt said.
The Trojans play Pepperdine at 3 p.m. on Saturday and Occidental and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at 9 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, respectively.

Although it is only the third week of school, students are already not following USC’s mask mandate, posing risks for themselves and the people around them.
Prior to reopening campus for the Fall 2021 semester, the University administration established a mask mandate that requires all students, faculty and University staff to wear masks while inside campus facilities. Although there are no direct guidelines for masks in outdoor settings, all attendees are asked to wear masks at large outdoor gatherings such as the New Student Convocation and the Welcome Back Concert. 
However, the University’s efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the coronavirus have been ignored by some members of the USC community. Ironically, dining halls are overcrowded and the only places where masks are not required because students are eating. Additionally, at Welcome Back events and in-person involvement fairs where facial coverings were required, many students often wore their masks below their noses or carried them in their hands.
The low positivity rate in the first two weeks of school may be the reason why students are treating the mask mandate less seriously.
According to the USC COVID-19 Dashboard, in weeks one and two, the total number of positive cases were 152 and 143, respectively. Meanwhile, the positivity rates among students are 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, and is lower than that of Los Angeles County. However, the risks of contracting the virus may not always remain low on campus.
The delta variant is more infectious than other variants and can even infect fully vaccinated people. However, this variant is not the only threat. A new coronavirus variant, also known as mu, has been recently listed by the World Health Organization as a “variant of interest.” WHO indicated that the mu variant can potentially evade immunity created by vaccines and antibodies, meaning it can infect both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Although the variant is not currently common in the United States, it should warrant people’s vigilance.
The ongoing spread of the delta variant and the potential risks brought by the mu variant shows that our struggle against the coronavirus is not over. Students must continue to wear masks and monitor their health. By strictly following the University mandates, students can help prevent the surge of the positivity rate on campus and even lower it to a great extent.
When attending classes and events indoors, students should follow the mandate by keeping masks on and above their noses at all times. According to the Centers for Disease Control, “masks should completely cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides of [the] face without gaps.” Johns Hopkins Medicine reveals that respiratory droplets can be inhaled through the nose and cause infection. 
Apart from wearing masks incorrectly, eating in class should also be strongly discouraged, as per the University’s mandate. 
Situations may vary when it comes to the outdoors. The University does not require students to wear masks when they walk on campus but had previously asked students to wear masks during school-wide events throughout the first two weeks of school. However, students should consider keeping their face masks on while attending large outdoor gatherings throughout the semester.
The CDC advises people to wear their masks when they cannot stay six feet apart from people who don’t live with them in an outdoor setting. Walking on the crowded Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way on campus at noon does not necessarily satisfy a six-foot distance. Hence, students should also consider wearing their masks when they are walking in these overcrowded areas. 
The mask mandate, along with the weekly coronavirus tests and daily Trojan Check, may seem cumbersome to some people. However, these policies are established to protect the students, faculty, staff and the community. It is necessary for students to be responsible for their actions and maintain a safe campus for everyone.

Although QR codes have existed on a smaller scale for a while, with grocery stores using them for coupons and concerts using them for tickets, the increase in QR usage amid the pandemic has resulted in a new conversation: accessibility. 
QR codes are scannable patterns that lead to more information, such as links to websites, restaurant menus, list servers, etc. They are scannable through phone cameras or third-party scanning apps. As of 2020 and the surge of QR usage, about 55% of consumers in the United States have used QR codes at least once at a restaurant, and a quarter of people have never scanned one prior to the pandemic. Now, companies are opting for this paperless method to decrease the transmission of the coronavirus.  
There is also an environmentally friendly aspect to QR codes since they decrease the number of paper products used by companies such as restaurants. With this in mind, QR codes clearly have benefits; however, the hyper-increase of QR code usage is leaving key U.S. populations behind.
QR codes may not be accessible to people who do not have the most recent technology. As the latest phones often cost a fortune, there is a connection between lack of accessibility and lower-income community members who cannot afford to invest in new tech every few years.  
iPhone 11 or higher and Android 9 or higher are the only phones able to scan low-quality QR codes, whereas older phones may not be able to read the code. Consequently, users would either have to download a third party QR scanning app or invest in a newer phone to easily access codes.  
There could be other ways to read QR codes, such as downloading them or enabling QR scanning on phone settings. However, this not only complicates the supposed simple task of scanning a code for those who don’t have the newest iPhone, but also it complicates it for those who are not necessarily tech-savvy, specifically older generations. 
According to YouGov, 14% of the U.S. population think QR codes are difficult, 18% have never heard of them and about 20% of the group who think QR codes are confusing are over 65 years old. Of course, the inconvenience of QR codes for older adults can vary, from not being able to look at a restaurant menu to more drastic inconveniences, such as not being able to set up appointments online for the coronavirus vaccine or testing. 
As more operations begin to opt for the usage of QR codes, there is a clear accessibility gap that must be addressed beforehand. This could also be extended to other paperless options that have risen to decrease transmission of the coronavirus, including cashless paying. 
Although going paperless decreases the transmission of the coronavirus through money, things like credit cards, tap and go apps like Apple Pay and third-party payment apps such as Venmo highlight the same concern of not only leaving older generations behind but also neglecting  low-income families and people who do not have the ability to use credit and debit cards due to their immigration status. 
The conservation of QR codes could be applied to a bigger picture of how tech companies and society ignore this accessibility gap in favor of profit. This could even be seen at USC, which has almost exclusively opted for a QR code-centric campus for mobile ordering, entering campus with Trojan Checks and making coronavirus test appointments. 
While QR codes decrease coronavirus transmission for reopening businesses and offer a significantly effective, environmentally friendly alternative to paper, there needs to be a balance between using these codes and having options for those who cannot access them. 
Some of these options could include having a small number of paper alternatives for those who cannot access QR codes or having workers with the technological ability to assist less tech-savvy consumers. Both of these options maintain the environmentally friendly benefits of QR codes while also combating the accessibility gap.
At the end of the day, before making QR codes in the future, we need to think about the impact they will have on different populations, such as older generations and low-income community members.
