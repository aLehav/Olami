The Academic Culture Assembly held USC’s fourth annual TEDxTrousdale event, “TEDxTrousdale 2016: Make Your Mark,” this Saturday at Cammilleri Hall.  The lineup for the event included six student speakers and a student performer. Chris Lam, a junior video producer for Buzzfeed, gave a guest keynote speech.
TEDx events are licensed TED events that are planned independently by various communities and organizations. The purpose of the event is to expand the interests of USC students and showcase the insights and accomplishments of USC students.
The theme of the event, “Make Your Mark,” was the subject of every speaker’s presentation. The first student speaker, Demontae Thompson, a master’s student studying postsecondary administration and student affairs, kicked off the event with a powerful message about “bending towards success,” exemplified in his spoken word poem, “Almost There.”
Aura Gilham, a first-year student at the Gould School of Law, followed with a lesson on the importance of making deliberate choices instead of merely going with the flow. Next were Katie Kreitzer, a junior studying design communication and NGOs and social change, and Xavier Hernandez, a senior studying industrial and systems engineering, who shared their stories of perseverance and ultimate triumph.
To start the second half of the event, Leo Xia, a singer-songwriter and junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, performed an original song named “Shaky Arms,” which addressed the difficulty of being an Asian American in today’s race conversations.
The speeches then resumed with Alexa Trujillo, a senior majoring in business administration, who inspired the audience with a personal story about inadequacy and self-confidence.
The final student speaker, Kurt Clements, a senior majoring in communication and a sports writer for the Daily Trojan, closed the student portion of the event with a flashback to his freshman year.  In his keynote address, Lam discussed the importance of self-education and social awareness when dealing with prominent social issues like race and gender.
The planning committee worked for six months to put the event together and the speakers rehearsed for weeks beforehand.
“We started planning this in November,” said Allison Bowen, the executive director of TEDxTrousdale 2016. “We received a record number of applicants this year for both the event’s selection committee and the speakers, so it took a lot of time to put this team together. It all turned out really well, though, and I’m glad I got to lead the planning of an event that creates an environment for other people to grow.”
This sentiment was echoed by other members of the Academic Culture Assembly and the selection committee. Gilham believed that voicing her beliefs were important.
“Applying was a shot in the dark for me,” Gilham said. “This entire TED experience, however, really helped me voice the thoughts that had been floating inside my head for a while now. Though it can be scary that choices carry a lot of responsibility, choices define a person, right or wrong, so it’s important to make sure you’re living deliberately.”
The audience members also felt they benefited from the TEDx experience.
“The speakers were really incredible,” said Maya Bouchet, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development. “It was so nice to hear students talk honestly about both their successes and their struggles. There was also a nice balance between the importance of striving for success and not being too hard on yourself.”

The USC chapter of the World is Just a Book Away raised funds to build libraries for underprivileged children in Indonesia, Mexico and Los Angeles at its sixth-annual 5K run on Saturday.
Founded in 2008 by James Owens, an associate professor of clinical management communication at the Marshall School of Business, WIJABA seeks to promote literacy among children who would otherwise have little access to educational resources.
“I decided to start a charity in 2008 to build a library in Sidoarjo, Indonesia — the region most deeply affected by the world’s worst mud flow disaster — and in 2009 we built the first library,” Owens said. “If we give children access to books, they can grow and learn to experience the world in different ways.”
WIJABA Director Jacobi Wade helped organize this year’s event with the USC chapter. Wade joined WIJABA five years ago as a volunteer and became a full-time director in January 2015. Like Owens, Wade is a firm believer that access to books can lead to world change.
“The simplest way to make sure that we raise children who contribute to our growing world is to teach them to read and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity,” Wade said. “If there is anything that reading books has taught me, it is that our world does not have to remain the way it is now. Things can be different.”
Since its founding, this global non-profit organization has distributed over 50,000 books, built 49 libraries and reached 27,000 children worldwide. WIJABA’s first annual 5K run raised enough money to build a library in Padang, Indonesia, and since then, membership has grown and new programs have been implemented.
One such program is Roots and Shoots, which is a partnership with the Jane Goodall Institute that aims to equip children with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve the quality of their local environments.
“Roots and Shoots is a five-week educational program held at a library where the kids learn all about the environment and their role in the environment,” Owens said. “It culminates with the kids forming their own Roots and Shoots chapter where they decide what they want to change about their own local environments.”
Owens recalled how happy the local children felt when the construction of WIJABA’s Los Angeles library was completed.
“At our Los Angeles library opening, one little boy looked at a book and then at one of our board members and asked ‘Can I pick it up?’” Owens said. “He didn’t understand the concept that he had the right to pick up a book. Another little girl looked around the library and said ‘I don’t have any money for books,’ so we had to explain the concept of what a library meant to her.”
Owens plans to keep building libraries with WIJABA in developing countries, hoping that this will help these children change the world.
“Children who have access to something positive have the opportunity to change their lives, and, when children change their lives, they can change the world,” Owens said.

The L.A. Healthy Kids Fair, hosted by WorldMed, promoted healthcare education to elementary school children and their families Sunday in Alumni Park.
The fair aimed to provide a fun and informative day for elementary school children and their families through activities and informational stands.
According to their Facebook page, WorldMed is a student organization based at the Keck School of Medicine dedicated to learning about health issues, raising awareness about these issues in communities in order to enact change.
As the co-director of philanthropy of the graduate division of WorldMed, Briana Shipley, a graduate student in the masters of science in global medicine program, was one of the main coordinators of the event.
“A lot of what we learn in our classes is that a big problem within healthcare isn’t just access, it’s education within access,” Shipley said. “So we wanted to give an opportunity to the community, kids and their families, to learn how to improve their health care as well as have fun.”
Johara Morovati, treasurer for the undergraduate division of WorldMed, also agreed that in helping the graduate part of WorldMed with their events, the USC community can better promote healthcare education in the surrounding community.
“I hope that [participants] gain a better understanding on how to improve their health from various aspects and also know that it’s feasible,” Morovati said.
The fair featured five different stations: nutrition, mental health, diabetes, oral health and myths. Children learned through various activities at each of the booths.
Ada Okoye and Diana Xu, juniors majoring in business administration, volunteered at the nutrition booth, which had boxes of cereal designed to teach children and their families healthy eating.
Okoye, who learned about the event through the Black Alumni Association, volunteered because she thought it was important to educate children about nutrition and exercise as early as possible.
“I thought it was a good opportunity because I’m really into health and fitness,” Okoye said. “It’s really important for children to learn it at a young age because I don’t think I had that until it came to me in college. When you start earlier, it’ll help you live a healthier lifestyle earlier on.”
Xu, who learned about the event through Circle K, agreed, saying she hopes families learned how important it is to be healthy.
“Nowadays, I feel like a lot of kids are on their electronic devices which we never had when we were their age,” Xu said. “It’s especially important to learn nutrition and exercise.”
Okoye and Xu were two of many people who volunteered to work at the various stations. Shipley appreciated the Trojan Family’s enthusiasm for their program.
“It was very nice to have so many volunteers sign up,” Shipley said. “For us, it isn’t just about the community — we also wanted to bring [the Health Sciences Campus] and [the University Park Campus] together and be a more cohesive force.”
In addition to the health education initiatives, WorldMed integrated other activities for the children to promote a healthy lifestyle. The event also included food, raffle prizes, giveaways and a photobooth. Students from the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance explained the benefits of dance and music at their booth, and student-athletes played games with the children.
“If it’s not fun, then people are not going to want to improve and implement what they learn in their own lives,” Shipley said.
To market their inaugural Healthy Kids Fair, WorldMed reached out to local institutions including schools in South and East Los Angeles areas, Boys and Girls Clubs and USC resources such as the JEP house and outreach coordinators at the Health Sciences Campus.
Shipley hopes that at the end of the L.A. Healthy Kids Fair, families take away lessons on how to live a healthy lifestyle.
“We want them to realize that living a healthy lifestyle is very doable,” Shipley said. “It doesn’t matter what your socioeconomic status is or how much time you have. It’s something that you have to make a priority.”

Coming off a huge victory over No. 2-ranked Pepperdine last Thursday, the No. 1-ranked beach volleyball team traveled to the South over the weekend to participate in the 2016 Cowtown Classic hosted by TCU.  Of the four teams in the field, USC came out on top as they produced three clean sweeps to improve their record to 23-2 overall and extended their winning streak to 19 matches in a row.
USC’s experience as the defending national champions would prove to be too much for their opponents over the weekend, as all three victories came by way of 5-0 scores. All in all, the Women of Troy have swept opponents 13 times this season and dropped just three of the 33 total sets they played in Fort Worth. Furthermore, USC’s top five flights have now all amassed more than 20 total wins this season in their respective pairs.
To open the tournament, the Women of Troy took on New Mexico on Friday afternoon. The five pair of sophomore Jo Kremer and graduate student Zoe Nightingale scored the first point of the dual with a three-set victory over Carson Heilborn and Maddie Mayfield (21-12, 19-21, 15-7), marking their 20th overall win together on the season. The four pair of sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante soon joined the 20-win club with a three-set win over Eastyn Baleto and Marisa Doran (23-25, 21-14, 15-10). The clinching point of the dual was scored by juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes, who easily handled Cassie House and Ashley Kelsey on Court 1 (21-7, 21-8). USC’s three pair of juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler tacked on the fourth point over Hannah Johnson and Julia Warren (21-12, 21-14), while junior Sophie Bukovec and senior Alexa Strange ended the 5-0 win with a sweep over Lisa Rugland and Devanne Sours on Court 2 (21-17, 21-10).
Early Saturday morning, USC faced Louisiana-Monroe and produced another 5-0 sweep. Sophomore Terese Cannon and freshman Katrina Kernochan came in at the five spot and delivered a 21-14, 21-8 win over Catherine Griffith and Bayleigh Hoffman, while Belton and Bustamante added the second point of the dual with a victory over Claire Crossfield and Tara Jenkins (21-9, 18-21, 15-8). Once again the match was clinched at the top court by Claes and Hughes, who steamrolled Hope Pawlik and Taylor Zaeske (21-8, 21-6), while Bukovec and Strange added the fourth point over Kori Simpson and Hadley Swartz at the No. 2 spot (21-10, 21-11). Lastly, Martin and Wheeler capped off the sweep with a 21-8, 21-13 win over Delaney Driver and Kaitlyn Shearer.
In the premier matchup of the tournament against host TCU later that day, the Women of Troy shut the door quickly and spoiled the Horned Frogs’ afternoon with their third consecutive 5-0 sweep. At the two bottom flights, Belton and Bustamante outlasted Jaelyn Greene and Molly Scheel (21-17, 21-12) on Court 4, while Kremer and Nightingale defeated Sierra Kile and Ariah Palter (21-15, 21-13) on Court 5. All-Americans Claes and Hughes clinched the team victory for the third straight time on Court 1 with a 21-12, 21-10 win over Olivia Canales and Shane Peters, marking the duo’s 56th straight victory together and pushing their season record to 31-0. Bukovec and Strange then bested Michelle McNamee and Sarita Mikals with an identical 21-9, 21-9 score at Court 2, while Martin and Wheeler rounded out the perfect weekend with a 21-15, 21-13 win at Court 3.
When the tournament was all said and done, USC improved their overall record to 23-2 on the season, while ULM fell to 10-15, New Mexico moved to 16-7 and TCU fell to 16-6 overall.
The regular season schedule continues for the Women of Troy, who will now go back home and prepare for one last weekend tournament. USC will take to the sands of Honolulu, Hawaii, for the second time this year when they play in the 2016 Aloha Invitational this Friday and Saturday. The duals tournament will be held on a neutral court at Queen’s Beach with a jam-packed field that includes No. 5 Hawaii, No. 6 Long Beach State and No. 9 Florida International.

Another spring session is in the books for the Trojan football team, and now the wait begins for fall practice and the opener against the Alabama Crimson Tide. Spring practice is great for showcasing potentially new dynamic players as well as offering a glimpse of what the season ahead brings. This year, Clay Helton’s first as head coach, was no different.
While most of the focus surrounded the quarterback battle between redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, there were points of interest all across the Trojan roster. In addition, fans and players got their first taste of the newly assembled coaching staff. The group of coaches offers an interesting blend of holdovers from the current staff, returning coaches on their second tour of USC and Helton connections.
Coaching is such an important component of player development at the collegiate level, and it seems that this group knows what they are doing. While it is still early, and the sample size is only 15 practices, the quotes and practice assessments coming from both coaches and players seem to be markedly improved in terms of discipline and organization from years past.
In particular, both sides of the line appear to be in good hands. The offensive line, which returns the bulk of their depth chart, is led by new coach Neil Callaway. Callaway has more than 30 years of experience in coaching, and brings sage wisdom and a low key approach that has the line looking in sync and developing at a rapid pace. So far, Callaway has impressed with his role during the spring and could be the best line coach the Trojans have had since Tim Drevno during the 2014 season.
An offensive line that is strong and mobile as well as disciplined will be a key to the Trojans’ success regardless of who is under center. On the defensive side, the front four will set the tone for a back seven that returns a wealth of talent.
Unfortunately, the front four is relatively thin at this stage. Redshirt junior defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow Jr., who was expected to be an anchor on the line this year, was lost for the season during the spring. The Trojans suffered another scare yesterday as sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson left practice with what Helton said is hopefully a minor injury. Any more losses on an already beleaguered front four will make first-year coach Kenenchi Udeze’s job even harder.
Udeze who was a star at USC and part of the Wild Bunch 2 line that featured fellow NFL stalwarts Mike Patterson and Sean Cody in addition to Omar Nazel, moves into a position coaching role with great promise and fanfare. What he may lack in years of coaching, Udeze more than makes up for with enthusiasm, passion and firsthand knowledge and experience of what it takes to be great at both the collegiate and professional level.
One of Udeze’s strengths in the spring and hopefully going forward will be the development of some of USC’s younger athletes on the line who have demonstrated tremendous potential and just to need refine their technique to elevate their game.
Building up strong lines on both sides of the ball will allow Helton to implement his desired game plan, and win with a punishing and high octane attack. One spring session won’t build the final product, as that will take some serious time, but the Trojans made some serious strides in their first 15 sessions.
The team is stacked at the receiver and running back positions and has many young and talented defensive backs and linebackers. With a renewed emphasis on spreading the ball around next season, the Trojans could have some other position players join junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, junior defensive back and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson and sophomore tailback Ronald Jones II on the national radar. If they can stay healthy athletes like redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr., senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers, redshirt sophomore wide receiver Ajene Harris and sophomore tailback Dominic Davis all could have expanded roles in the offense.
Ultimately, regardless of who is under center in the first game, if the Trojans can further develop their offensive line and make sure either Darnold and Browne has enough time to spread the ball around to the immense talent surrounding them, the Trojans could be in great shape next season.
Spring session is over and the early results on offense look promising. Now, the fall will be about making sure the defense can stay healthy and match the offenses’ progress so Helton’s debut season as head coach will be a successful one.

M. Lamar performed his multimedia goth opera Funeral Doom Spiritual: For Male Soprano, Piano, and Electronics Saturday evening at Tommy’s Place and the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, following his video installation at the  ONE National  Gay and Lesbian Archives and Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s discussion of Robert Mapplethorpe’s documentation of the black male form.
His performance consisted of an operatic narrative of black death, murder, and subsequent “deathlessness” under a white supremacist regime in the apocalyptic future 100 years from now. Utilizing a hyperbolic goth and heavy-metal aesthetic, the accompanying video featured theatrical images of a black man in a coffin, black people in cages and flames occluding cathedral windows — all presented in a digitally glitched black and white format. He played the piano as he sang and also featured the auditory mixings of musician Hunter Hunt-Hendrix.
After the performance itself, Lamar was joined by Syracuse University professor of law and LGBT studies and fellow musical collaborator on this piece, Tucker Culbertson, for a post-show discussion and audience Q & A. This section of the show was by far the most engaging for those in the audience not intimately familiar with opera or Lamar’s previous work. Lamar expounded his theories of white male fantasies of the black male form, indicated by both hypersexualized depictions by artists like Mapplethorpe and by Darren Wilson’s testimony that Michael Brown “looked like a demon” as he approached the police car. He referred to these imaginings of blackness by white viewers as “two sides of the same coin,” each fetishizing and stereotyping black men in the same ways.
However, he did not directly address his choice of subject matter in relation to the medium he favors — how exactly goth, metal and opera evoke the black psyche in the face of white supremacy. During the Q & A with the audience, several attendees were quick to point out that historically speaking, metal as a musical genre had been biased toward white supremacy. Lamar explained that following his exit from Yale’s graduate art program, he discovered that the punk and goth music scenes were very closely tied to the Southern Negro spirituals he grew up with in that bleak and often macabre imagery thrived in both genres.
As for his focus on gothic imagery to depict his subject matter, Lamar described it to one questioner as a compulsion, something he must do to continue living. He seemed completely at ease addressing both the more academic and historical aspects of his work as well as the deeply personal — tearing up at one question that asked him to clarify his movement from punk into opera. He explained that at the point that he became romantically involved with his now art director, Sabin Michael Calvert, he became more interested in the intimacy of opera rather than the aggressive confrontation of punk music.
This craving for intimacy seemed clear in his eagerness to answer questions, requesting, “just one more” three times beyond when the house asked him to stop. He lingered around the space as well, chatting with event staff and eager audience members long after the event ended. His very candid and intelligent discussion of his performance definitely achieved this intimacy with the audience and his artistic choices were for the most part illuminated.
However, his performance alone fell somewhat flat. He himself admitted after the show that opera is by no means a populist art form, but the choice of opera rather than more popular forms like punk, rock or even gospel-style sound was perhaps more difficult for many to connect with. Furthermore, though the theme of black death and deathlessness remains relevant through the Black Lives Matter movement today, his works are largely based in historical events like slavery, which in some ways removes the sense of urgency from his social critiques.
All in all, M. Lamar’s event was highly successful and thought provoking, but his artistic work requires extensive explanation to become accessible and relevant.

This column is intended to analyze the role women play in film — both in front of and behind the camera, above and below the line. But it would be remiss of me to ignore the ever burgeoning world of television (both on air and on the internet). To analyze women in film is to analyze women in the industry, and to analyze women in the industry is to analyze television. And the last couple months have been tumultuous for female characters on television, especially gay women.
This debate has been argued to the nth degree across the internet and there is more educated, intelligent scholarship on the matter beyond this column, but the issue only recently came to my attention.
This past Tuesday, I had a phone interview (for a school-related project) with screenwriter and TV showrunner Javier Grilllo-Marxuach, who is not only in charge of the new Xena: Warrior Princess reboot at NBC but is also a producer on the CW’s The 100.
When discussing Xena and the depiction of the gay undertones throughout the original version of the show and how it might differ with this upcoming reboot, Javier said that he feels especially mindful of how to treat a possible gay relationship in Xena now than ever before. This mindfulness comes after the onslaught of criticism that erupted after the death of The 100’s Lexa (Alycia Debnam-Carey), a known and beloved lesbian character. Lexa’s death was just one in a string of deaths that would permeate the television landscape this spring, and is what caused such an outcry of disappointment (and outrage) among fans and critics alike.
Second, I read The Hollywood Reporter’s TV critic Daniel Fienberg’s article addressing the fact that six major female characters were killed off in the week before last on TV. Fienberg addresses the fact that the women were not all gay, and that they probably weren’t killed off based on any singular trope that TV writers had told each other secretly and maliciously in order to perpetuate some sort of message. Instead, he describes the six female characters and the various reasons behind their deaths (contracts were up, it was based on the source material’s plot, “the story demanded it” etc.) and how the murders might affect the consensus of the shows. He doesn’t go too in depth into the Bury Your Gays argument. Although he points out that it is, in fact, valid he describes what he feels is a much larger issue, and that issue is the use of death as a plot device.
Fienberg’s report really honed in on what I find is at issue with television at the moment because it seems we’ve found ourselves in a bit of a rut creatively. Regardless of the fact that six women were killed last week on television, I feel like the real problem arrives with the construct of killing off characters at all. It is a common device used in writers rooms and plot lines: if an actor wants off a show or the story needs a bit more drama, kill off a favorite character and make the audience pay attention again. Death may alienate an audience but it also attracts attention, and none of us are unfamiliar with the concept of “bad press is good press.” The use of death in a show is about as prevalent as the use of an anti-hero as our main character (Don Draper, Tony Soprano, Walter White, Dr. House, etc.). Having been in several screenwriting classes myself, I have also witnessed the employment of death as an instigator for action, more often than not. And so I feel that the true issue lies at the rate in which this happens.
It’s not just that women are being killed off, or gay characters (although these are issues to keep in mind) it’s that we, as a culture, have come so accustomed to writing and receiving this type of plot device. HBO’s show The Sopranos, which ran from 1999 to 2007, is largely considered one of the first television shows to kick off the “Golden Age” of television and is also credited for being one of the greatest shows of all time. All that notoriety given to a show about mob boss Tony Soprano, who has no qualms with killing off an ancillary character just because he feels like it, at any time he wants.
We don’t object to these deaths because they are under the guise of art or great, engrossing drama, but I think that we — collectively — need to take a step back and start to earn back the use of death in our stories. This isn’t just about desensitization. It’s about realizing that death is not an issue to be taken lightly or use haphazardly and with abandon. Television is a powerful medium and death equally so, but it feels as if it’s being treated uncarefully and without thought.

The four-day Los Angeles Dance Festival united the community through the celebration of contemporary dance in Los Angeles.  Only in its fourth year, this year’s festival,  which took place April 14-17, was well received by a large crowd of dancers and non-dancers alike.
Every night there were many dances   consisting  of multiple dance companies. To keep the shows at reasonable lengths, each company performed one piece. The brief presentations from the collection of companies produced a stunning contrast, keeping audience members at the edge of their seats in excitement and anticipation. As each dance company in the program is well established, the shows were of a high caliber, showcasing some of the best contemporary dance companies in Los Angeles.
The opening night gave the viewer a taste of the diverse festival. Four different companies performed: Ate9 dANCE cOMPANY, The Union Project Dance Company, BrockusRED and Wax/Wane, featuring Alyssa Allen, a freshman dance major in the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance.
Deborah Brockus, the producer of the LADF, skillfully divided the remaining three shows by styles.
“[Friday] is more of the eclectic, urban, jazz contemporary, a little more theatrical. Saturday night is more of the technical modern-based contemporary, and Sunday is the avant-garde, off-the-walls stuff. So, there’s something for everyone. Pick your choice,” Brockus said after the opening night performance.
There was certainly something for everyone. Of the 30 companies showcased, each offered such a unique voice. Each performance was so impactful, not just for the remarkably talented dancers and choreographers, but also the personal experience. The performances took place at the modest Diavolo Space, where the audience sits level with the stage, only a few feet away from the dancers.
“This is actually how modern dance was created in L.A. back in the 20th century. It was intimate, visceral, close to the artists, and you can feel it and see it, and you’re not in a 4,000 seat theater,”  Brockus said. “I think that there’s power to that. There’s power to the human body and experiencing things with other people, and I am a huge fan for live dance. I’ve seen so many videos that aren’t good. Some pieces are worse, some pieces are better, but live is real. I want to eat food; I want to experience life.”
Aside from the performances, the festival offered two full days of classes with more offered next weekend at Brockus Project Studios, led by dancers or artistic directors of the 30 dance companies. These open classes, each consisting of one hour and 15 minutes, gave dancers of all levels the opportunity to immerse themselves in a company’s repertoire and style, and to experience the professionalism the rehearsal process demands.
Many of the professional dancers took classes from other performing companies. Experiencing the melting pot of dancers from all origins who are all connected by the passion to move, was incredibly inspiring and soul-cleansing.
The LADF was a success because it not only celebrated the artists that are dancing and creating, but also to those who didn’t have a dance background. Additionally, it offered great exposure for the Los Angeles dance artists.
Although theater and dance in Los Angeles are overshadowed by the entertainment industry, the LADF helped to grow support for the dance community and invited every person of every demographic to come and experience the human soul and movement.
“If I could make dance go viral in Los Angeles, I’d be so happy. Get out of your couch, close your phone, and come experience live dance. That’s my goal,” Brockus said.
Next weekend the LADF will be holding another day full of classes and auditions for LADF companies.

Last Saturday while I was out with friends, I received a harrowing text message. It was from my one of my cousins in Ohio whom I haven’t talked to in a few months.
“Strange,” I thought before swiping right to open the text.
The text said that my older cousin Will Smith, the former NFL Saints player, had been murdered. Accompanying the text was a photo of him. He said to pray for Will’s wife and children. I don’t remember too much after that. Unfortunately, I have felt this feeling before. This is not the first time gun violence has affected my life. But man, did this one hurt. According to reports, Will was driving home with his wife when a fender bender occurred. An argument ensued with the other driver, Will’s wife was shot, and in his attempt to defend her, Will was also shot multiple times. He died shortly after.
When I was growing up, I remember hearing about how great of a football player my older cousin Will was. At each year’s family reunion my uncles would update me about his career at the Ohio State University, and later I saw his talent for myself when he played in the NFL for the Saints. I was so upset that I couldn’t go to the family reunion in New Orleans the year after he and his team won the Super Bowl. I ironically passed on that opportunity to participate in a journalism program.
Yet, last Saturday when I received that message, I didn’t see it through the eyes of a journalist. I saw it as a cousin who couldn’t believe someone would dare bring harm to her family member. The news about my cousin’s death — unsurprisingly — spread quickly. I woke up the next morning, eyes still swollen from crying, to a barrage of #RIPWillSmith tweets on my timeline and news stories.
As someone aspiring to enter journalism professionally, I had an acute eye on the coverage of Will’s life. With a story like this, it’s so easy to just focus on the sensationalism and forget that there are actual family members who are grieving and experiencing a void of loss that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.
In this current political election, with all regular news of gun violence and the words “black-on-black” crime being casually tossed around in debates, it’s so easy to simplify complex stories.
As I scrolled through my timeline looking through all the Will Smith coverage, I also ran across a story from BuzzFeed about black trauma and how the media exploits and captures the pain of African Americans and packages it as entertainment. Think about how in 2010 Antoine Dodson’s recounting of his sister’s attempted rape became the “Bed Intruder” song or how Sweet Brown’s story of her house burning down is just remembered as the woman with the bandana who said “cold pop.” News becomes news when it’s stranger than fiction, but it seems for African Americans who express that pain, it becomes funny and shareable.
I was afraid the media’s coverage of my cousin’s death might spiral into something like that. His celebrity might be exploited. I was afraid that he would become another example of black violence. But he was much more than that. He was my older cousin.
So last Sunday as I watched the hashtag #RIPWillSmith trend and read news organization’s tweets and listened to the press conferences it made me proud to be a journalist. It seemed like they were also genuinely shocked at his death. All the stories they wrote had official statements; there wasn’t speculation in who provoked the argument. In Will’s obituary they talked about their positive interactions with him and how he had effected change down in the Big Easy. TV commentators asked officials how his wife was doing and talked about the impact this must have for her emotionally. I could see the human element in this story. Most of the photos they shared of him was of him with his wife and children.
Today’s 24-hour news cycle gets a lot of flak. Sometimes it is rightfully so because it perpetuates the idea that time needs to be filled with stories, even if they are not fully reported or thought through. Yet, now, as I step into this industry full-time as a journalist in a few weeks, I have a restored faith. Will’s story was protected by this industry. In this past week, news organizations helped the public realize his legacy. They honored the tenets of journalism, they humanized the story and they made me proud.
Even in the wake of this tragedy, I found a glimmer of hope. May my cousin Will Smith rest in peace and may journalists keep doing their jobs.

The Undergraduate Student Government is voting on a bylaw change this Tuesday to give the Executive Board more flexibility in determining the work requirements and compensation levels for USG officials. Supporters of the change maintain that the total expenditure on student stipends will more or less remain the same. Regardless, the move should remind all Trojans that USG compensation is far above average and compel USG to seriously reconsider compensation levels during the planned bylaws rewrite this summer.
USG compensation is already high compared to other top California universities. During the 2013-2014 school year, USG spent $239,000 on student stipends — the compensation students receive for serving as an elected or appointed USG official — which was far more than the student governments of UCLA, UC Berkeley or Stanford spent. Two years later, in 2015-2016, total stipend spending was $9,000 higher, totaling $248,000.
That $248,000 total is not expected to change for 2016-2017. USG Vice President Austin Dunn said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that when the Budget Committee met this weekend to discuss the upcoming USG budget, they aimed to keep total stipends at the current level.
However, a total stipend line item near a quarter of $1 million is excessive and should be lowered as soon as possible. Dunn also mentioned that he and the Executive Board would be meeting once this semester ends to completely rewrite the bylaws, which would give them an opportunity to lower stipend amounts across the board.
In the last election cycle, candidates asked for Trojan votes because, ostensibly, they wanted to serve students. Elected officials do a disservice to students if they seek higher office primarily for the financial compensation. No one should come to USG seeking personal wealth. Yet, payouts for student leaders remain high.
At other universities, where student leaders are paid less, student government positions are still competitively sought after. Some students have a sincere desire to serve their communities. When the topic has been previously brought up at USC, USG members have stated that the stipends must remain to compensate officials who would otherwise need to seek private employment to afford their time in school. Still, it remains unclear how student officials at UCLA, Stanford and UC Berkeley are able to survive with lower stipends than USC student representatives. USG can — and must — do better.

Click here to view this article with more media in our “It Takes a Village: USC and the Community” project package.
On the corner of Jefferson and Hoover, half-constructed buildings are partially coated in brick, revealing steel skeletons. In the sunlight, Hathaway Dinwiddie construction workers file in and out of the site, preparing the USC Village in time for its fall 2017 launch.
The $700 million project, which features 1.2 million square feet of space, nine new residential colleges, a recreational center and fields, classroom spaces and multiple retail openings, aims to better support the lives of USC students.
“I think it’s going to be a community expansion from USC, where people in the community will want to go over and access the new amenities,” said Emily Sandoval, director of Residential Education. “With the recreational center and green spaces and all that’s being constructed, that’s why we call it the Village — because that’s what it is, a mini village.”
According to Sandoval, from the perspective of student life, the area targets upperclassmen students, specifically sophomores. Sandoval acknowledged that of the approximately 2,000 upperclassmen who will live in the Village, some still seek a sense of community, even though they might not be new to the USC setting. 
“An area [Residential Education] could improve on is more of a focus on our sophomore, junior, senior student populations,” Sandoval said. “We’ve always focused on our upper-division students, but now we can put the spotlight on them as well as our first-year students … For those looking to build their circle, it doesn’t have to just stop in their student organizations — they can also look to their floor. We now get to enhance that upperclassman experience.”
In addition, the Village would look to better serve USC students’ needs. Along with transitioning to residential-college living, placing an emphasis on building greater relationships with those living within one building, resources would be more readily available to students. According to Sandoval, the Village would feature information stations in close proximity to living areas.
“We’re looking to build a mobile resource hub in collaboration with USC Housing.” Sandoval said. “In collaboration with our campus partners, such as career advisers or representatives from the Office for Health and Wellness Promotion, we hope to bring resources to where students live.”
Students, however, have criticized the lack of common space in the center. According to Craig Keys, USC Associate Senior Vice President for Civic Engagement and Government Relations, the Village plans include only one 800-square-foot community room that can be reserved for events and programs. Because the Village has been deemed a “residential-retail hub,” some have criticized the University’s greater emphasis on the retail aspect. 
“Although there is a lot of space on campus where students can hold events now … You can never have enough space,” said Alicia Rivera, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “[Residents] also shouldn’t have to go to campus to have those event spaces, they should be close to them.”
Regardless, Keys has maintained that, given the emphasis on community, the space at the Village will be sufficient for student wellness purposes.
“The community-focused amenities at the Village provide space within the project for community purposes and benefits,” Keys said. “Community members will be able to shop, eat, bank and hold community meetings at the new Village.”
Outside of the project’s effects on the students, the nearly three-year long construction has influenced the surrounding non-USC community. According to the April 2015 USC State of the Neighborhood reports, local residents have voiced their anxieties about increasing housing prices and the unaffordability of housing around the University Park Campus in general. The reports stated that the University ignored the predominantly Latino and African-American residents in favor of a shift from a commuter-based campus to a residential-based one.
“Even though it will make public retail space available, it’s public retail space that is catering to students and the parents who are going to be visiting,” said Karen Tongson, a professor of English and gender studies who also studies suburban culture, in a interview with the Daily Trojan in 2015. “It doesn’t necessarily provide low-cost retail or resources that were available at the University Village when it was a mall.”
Feeling the direct effects of the new Village are those affiliated with the 32nd Street School, a K-12 magnet across the street from the construction site. Whereas the old Village served as a budget-friendly shopping and dining hot spot for students after school due to its proximity to their homes, the new Village has raised questions over affordability.
“Definitely a big part of it was the loss of a big shopping center. My family used to do all of our shopping at the Superior, and now we have to go to places further out.” said Cesar Alvarejo, a student at the 32nd Street School. “I feel like with [the new Village], it should be something that benefits the community as well. It might be [affiliated with] USC, but I hope they help the area as well because they destroyed kind of a big community place.”
Ultimately, however, Sandoval stressed the importance of fusing both the USC community with the surrounding neighborhood. By integrating retail spaces with student housing, the new Village would be the intersection between students and the residents of Los Angele, providing a common ground for these populations.
“I’m from Los Angeles, so I grew up hearing stories about how my dad used to ride his bike through USC’s campus and how he saw the Dodger Stadium being built. Hopefully, there will still be that experience for kids out there, children from the community that could ride their bikes through our open campus.” Sandoval said. “It creates an inviting experience for people in the community to come eat or grab a cup of coffee and do their shopping. The Village will become part of the community in that way.”

For more than 30 years, Akm Alam has considered his business, Quik-Pix Photo Lab, to be a part of the USC community and the Trojan Family. 
Two years ago, his photo printing store took up a small space in the old University Village, sandwiched between campus and the Row. The space was a home for Alam. He was friendly with the students who came in for passport pictures and professional head shots and loyal to the faculty members who returned to his store year after year. Working near USC provided him with many benefits — a safe location, a steady and predominantly wealthy clientele base. Being a part of the Trojan family helped Alam survive.
But the beginning of the new Village’s construction forced Alam to leave his old store behind. He spent several years preparing for the inevitable, until construction officially began in 2014. He had no choice but to move north to an even smaller space closer to the highway. Since then, business has only dwindled. Alam’s story is only one of the many local businesses who were forced to relocate to make room for the Village.
Finding a new home
Alam’s new store is tucked into a strip mall on Vermont Ave., a 12-minute walk north of campus. On a muggy April morning, he leaves the door hanging open. Inside, his space is cramped. A photo backdrop and lighting equipment take up the back half of the room behind the front counter. The front half is consumed with scattered chairs and shelves of camera equipment and picture frames. 
He leans against the front counter as he explains, in a quiet and almost cheerful voice, that he has lost almost 80 percent of his business. That 80 percent has been lost in less than two years. Some of that is natural — he is running a photo printing business in an age where pictures are stored digitally, shared on social media and rarely put into print.
But his main drop in customers came when he was forced to leave his University Village location and find a new place to operate. There are many factors behind this change. Alam suspects that many of his former clientele aren’t even aware that he relocated rather than closing down. Now, his business mainly comes from the local area, a steep drop from his past days of serving faculty and students.
“It’s a completely different group of people that I get here now,” Alam said. “I miss the students, the faculty members. There were people who came to my store for years, people who I knew. Now there’s not as much [business] at all.”
Constructing a new image
The construction of the Village first began to affect local business owners in the area in 2010. At that time, all businesses in the area that is now in the process of becoming the Village were transitioned into month-to-month leases. But the greatest change came on May 1, 2014, when the businesses located in the space were forced to move out. 
For chain restaurants that were previously located in the Village’s space, the transition was relatively simple. Businesses such as the Denny’s and Superior Grocers — which were in the former Village — had a wider range of options due to their status as a franchise. All employees were guaranteed jobs at other locations, which meant that none of those employees or managers had to worry about losing their jobs. The main inconvenience fell upon customers who no longer had the convenience of those stores close by.
But for locally- owned businesses, the transition was much different. According to USC Civic Engagement Senior Vice President Craig Keys, 17 of the 37 businesses removed from the Village space were non-franchise businesses. Though the label of “non-franchise” does not necessarily mean that a business is locally owned, most of these businesses were similar to Alam’s store. 
From mom- and- pop convenience stores to a locally-owned hair salon that had been in the area for 40 years, these local businesses relied on their proximity to campus and USC clientele base in order to survive. The move away from campus did more than create a change in location for these businesses — it completely displaced them from the community in which they had grown and thrived.
The businesses in the area had known the move was coming since 2010. That was when their rents were switched to from year-long to month-by-month, and it signalled a new era for the local businesses. The University connected each of the businesses up- to- date on their rent to a real estate company in order to find a new location. This offer was extended to both franchise and non-franchise businesses, so that everyone involved had the opportunity to relocate. 
The University also provided financial assistance for the relocation or closing of a business. According to Keys, most tenants received anywhere from $17,500 to $20,000 in assistance. 
An uncertain future
Yet for business owners like Alam, the cost of relocating wasn’t the issue. With ample time to prepare, he found a space quickly, without the aid of the real estate agent. It’s just not the space he wants. With his store situated several blocks north of campus, and his clientele now mainly consisting of members of the community, he feels that he is beginning to lose a grip on his business.
Ideally, Alam would hope for his old space close to campus. However, this most likely won’t be a possibility. The new space will not be focused on retail, but rather on providing a living and community space for USC students. It aims to fulfill the need for a community living space for sophomore and transfer students, while simultaneously driving down the cost of student living by providing more housing options. The space is also expected to create a wider selection of businesses, community spaces and living spaces in order to diversify the space to create a vital new part of the community.
“The old University Village was a community- serving retail establishment which leased space to small business entities, but did not provide an environment or mix of amenities that could promote the success of the tenant businesses,” Keys said. “The new USC Village provides the amenities desired by the community in an environment that is better structured for the economic success of the retail tenants.”
This means, however, that there will be significantly less room for retail space. The Village spans more than 2 million square feet of space, but most of that space will be student housing. Retail space will only take up 160,000 square feet, a significant decrease from the amount that was afforded to businesses in the previous space.
One of the goals of the project is to create 12,000 new jobs through construction, but these jobs will only last on a temporary basis until the Village’s completion. The Village will also create permanent employment in the new establishments. However, most of these jobs will be focused in chain businesses or working in the residential halls. This means that there will be little to no space for local businesses to move back into the area. Keys does believe that some local businesses will be able to come into the space, but the expectations will be raised for the types of establishments that are welcomed into the community.
“The quality and relevance of the amenities and general environment  intended for the new USC Village are substantially higher than that of the old University Village,” Keys said. “Consistent with the needs of the Uuniversity and community, we are seeking best-in-class tenants to populate our key food and beverage, retail and service locations.  So while we will have several national brands, we will also have a variety of local and regional offerings.”
Alam, like many other local business owners, isn’t worried about a future with the Village — he’s simply trying to survive with what he has now.
His new store is smaller, and the rent is less expensive. He’s partnered with another photographer to start offering options such as event photography or senior portraits. Yet Alam admits that he sees no future for his business now. Without the access to his clientele base of students and faculty, he simply feels that his time has run out.
“In business, you always do what you can to keep going,” Alam said. “But this is not going to keep going. It just can’t.”

Nelly Cristales knew she would never leave her elementary school. 
She enrolled in kindergarten at the 32nd Street School in 1975. Now, she teaches second grade while her own children attend the school that she grew up in.
Cristales is also a Trojan. After completing elementary and middle school at 32nd Street, she went to the Downtown Magnets High School before attending USC. She graduated in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in general studies and a minor in Spanish and received her preliminary teaching credential from the Rossier School of Education. 
Cristales maintained her connection to the 32nd Street School throughout her time at USC, working as a teaching assistant. She was hired as a full-time teacher the August after her graduation and has been working there for the past 15 years. In addition to teaching, she coordinates the various programs that bring USC students to the 32nd Street campus, something she remembers from her time at the school. 
“I know we’ve always had some kind of relationship with SC,” Cristales said. “I still remember back as an elementary student, having SC students come over.”
USC has a wide range of programs it offers at 32nd Street, including the Joint Educational Project, which sends USC students to teach “mini courses” and also tutor students in reading. Students in the Thornton School of Music host a “Jazz in the Classroom” program and teach guitar and choir. This year, the Viterbi School of Engineering created a Robotics and Coding Academy for 5th grade students to learn about programming, robotics and engineering. Cristales praised the University for its community outreach efforts and the programs it coordinates for the 32nd Street School. 
“It’s really positive, you see any child here, they’re Trojans like crazy,” Cristales said. “Just having them here and then having that interaction with the students, it really focuses them on, ‘I want go to college,’ and ‘I want to go to ‘SC and be a Trojan,” she said.
These kind of programs are unheard of at other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District and is one of the reasons the 32nd Street School is so popular. The school has an enrollment of approximately 1,060 students, 40 percent of which are from the surrounding area, according to the Principal Ezequiel Gonzalez. Like all L.A. magnet schools, parents apply in the fall and are selected by a lottery, which often leads to long waiting lists. 
A good neighbor
Those waiting lists are due in part to the school’s proximity to USC, which sends dozens of students to volunteer at the 32nd Street School and the 14 other schools that together comprise the USC Family of Schools. Tammy Anderson, the executive director of JEP, has seen the impact of these programs firsthand. 
“Anytime we have USC students going over there, the kids are liking it, they’re enjoying seeing young people that are closer to their age than their teachers,” Tammy Anderson, the executive director of JEP said. “And they’re so close to us, they literally live across the street and see higher education, so it’s always kind of there in the back of their minds, and I think that’s very positive.” 
Tina Koneazny, associate director for JEP, coordinates the USC ReadersPLUS program which sends USC student tutors to work one-on-one with students who are struggling in either reading or math. A former teacher herself, Koneazny said it can be difficult for teachers to provide individualized attention, particularly in large classes where students have varying degrees of skill. 
“We have so many kids who are struggling with both reading and math, and sometimes all they need is just that one person to give them the individualized attention to meet their specific needs,” she said. 
Koneazny said each semester, the program administers pre- and post- tests to the students being tutored and about 70 percent “graduate” from the program, having been brought up to grade level. Still, Koneazny said many of the benefits of the program are intangible. 
“They make large strides, and they see themselves as learners and they seem themselves as somebody who can go college, and they look at themselves in a different way and they start to be successful again,” Koneazny said. 
From one student to another
Sandra Rivera is the coordinator for middle school tutoring programs at 32nd Street. She said the students are selected based on 10-week grades. If they have any fails they are required to come in for tutoring. Rivera said USC students have a unique impact on the school.
“It makes a big difference when we have the University students come out as opposed to other groups,” Rivera said. “I don’t know if it’s the energy that they bring in with them, the more one-on-one because they’re several, and the age, they’re able to connect with the students still.”
She said that the University serves to inspire students at the 32nd Street School.
“They see it as one of the colleges that they can go, one of their goals that they can apply to,” Rivera said. “And they see what the University campus looks like because they have field trips, they see the students, so it’s something that keeps them motivated to go to college.”
Alexa Huerta, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering and the tutoring chair for the USC Helenes, organizes the tutoring program for middle school students on Monday afternoons at the 32nd Street School. The middle school tutoring is a new program this semester, but the Helenes also tutor a third grade class on Wednesday mornings in collaboration with the Trojan Knights. Huerta said the Helenes expanded the program to reach more students at the school. The Monday afternoon sessions aim to help middle school students who are failing or at risk of failing their math classes. 
“My personal goal with this, specifically why we’re focusing on math, is because I feel like it’s such a foundational subject — each concept really builds off each other,” Huerta said. “And so in order to succeed later on, it’s pretty hard if you fall behind, and so if we can kind of bridge that gap with the kids who seem to be behind, I think it’ll help them a lot, not only this year in their math class, but in the years to come as well.
Huerta said that math is one of the main focuses of the tutoring, but the USC students also assist with English and reading comprehension with the third grade class. She spoke about the importance of USC students volunteering at the school because of its proximity to the University Park campus. 
“They’re literally our neighbors, so it’s good to have that connection,” she said.

Caroline Neubrand lives in Parkside Apartments, a building owned and operated by USC Housing. It’s a modest building. In her apartment, the sophomore media arts and practice major has a small kitchen and a window that overlooks the Parkside lawn, where student organizations often host events. But the building is not without downsides.
“It’s old,” Neubrand said. “We don’t have air conditioning. We don’t even have a fan in our bathroom. And we have people come into our apartment regularly to fix things when we’re not here.”
When Neubrand began to look into housing options for the next academic year, she was surprised by how much it would cost to live in Uuniversity-owned housing.
“I was looking at the housing prices for next academic year. This exact room, which costs [$4,955 per semester] this year, would cost [$5,130] next year. For the exact same room,” Neubrand said.
That sort of price increase isn’t limited to Parkside Apartments, or even to USC Housing. Over the next year, USC-owned apartments will see price increases in the hundreds of dollars across the board, and rental housing as a whole in University Park has undergone increases in price at a rapid pace. In the midst of a city whose apartments are becoming widely unaffordable, the USC area is facing even greater rent hikes.
Paying for proximity
A December report from housing rental website Zumper found that in 2015 the average rent increased by over 15 percent in the area surrounding USC, a “hip and upbeat young neighborhood” they called Congress North. This was relative to an 11.6 percent average increase across the city of Los Angeles. 
An analysis by Rentcafe, a housing rental website, found that the ZIP code 90007 around USC was the second-most expensive ZIP code for rentals in Los Angeles County for 2015 — even more expensive than the booming South Park neighborhood, which includes the area around the Los Angeles Convention Center, Staples Center and L.A. Live. The only more expensive area for rentals was in Santa Monica, in the vicinity of Santa Monica College.
To make the difference even starker, ZIP code 90018, which lies just west of 90007 and features similar demographics to the USC area but lacks a university, was the fourth- least expensive for rentals for 2015, according to the same analysis. The boundary wraps around neighborhoods like Adams-Normandie and Jefferson Park.
Both ZIP codes have median household incomes roughly half the county average of $53,000, and population densities are roughly the same in both, at around 17,000 people per square mile, according to the Environmental Systems Research Institute, a company that specializes in geographic data. But Rentcafe found that the average rent in the Adams-Normandie area amounts to $917. In adjacent University Park, that figure is $3,500, nearly four times as much.
The difference is the University. Apartments near USC are marketed toward students; apartments in Adams-Normandie and Jefferson Park generally are not. Esri identified college students as the predominant demographic in University Park, making up roughly one-third of the population. In the Adams-Normandie area, nearly half the population is composed of young Hispanic families.
Rising rates, shifting community
Allen Griffin isn’t a USC student, but he lives in the area. On a hazy Monday evening, Griffin stood on the corner of Adams Boulevard and Figueroa Street, waiting for a Metro Line 37 bus while preteens on skateboards performed tricks off a railing at Popeye’s behind him.
In the line of sight from where he stood lay Lorenzo, West 27th Place and University Gateway, some of the most popular “luxury” housing offerings for USC students.
Griffin moved into the USC neighborhood several months ago, so the newly heightened rents are the norm to him. But despite his short tenure in the area, he’s aware of the change.
“Just talking to the neighbors and so on, they do see an increase,” Griffin said. “Some more than 15 percent. It just depends, and if somebody moves out and their rent is $700, then somebody moves in and they don’t know, the rent goes up to $800. No one really knows about that if nobody checks.”
The rent increases Griffin mentioned, where one tenant pays more than the previous one, are something that in many places would be regulated by rent control laws. But in Los Angeles, those regulations are rapidly becoming less widespread. The city’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance applies almost solely to buildings constructed before 1979, and it only prevents landlords from rapidly increasing rents for current tenants — new tenants can be charged any amount more than what old tenants paid for the same space.
California’s Ellis Act gives landlords the ability to evict all their tenants, renovate or rebuild their properties, and then start anew without rent control, meaning the RSOR.S.O. is losing ground more rapidly than it would naturally.
Given all of this, landlords in the USC area typically get to charge the market price for their spaces — as much as potential tenants are willing to pay.
Because USC students have more resources at their disposal  —  bolstered by student loans and parental incomes — they are more inclined to pay for higher-cost apartments. Students also have a much greater desire to live near the university than other community members would.
Gary Painter, a real estate expert and professor at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, said that demand for student housing is the principal force affecting price in the area.
“The simple story is that there is more demand in the rental housing market because of demographic pressures (a lot of millennial renters). There are 1000’s [sic] of units in the pipeline to be added, but they have not been added to the supply yet,” Painter said in an email to Daily Trojan. “The neighborhood near USC is well located near USC and downtown L.A. This puts even more pressure on prices.”
Because of these market forces, non-USC community members, who are more price-sensitive and less picky about location, would likely choose to live in a nearby ZIP code where apartments cost four times less. This reduces the downward pressure on rents near USC and allows them to rise even more rapidly.
Another contributor to the price increases is the “luxury” factor, where significant mixed-use developments build in amenities to attract students and market themselves as such. Lorenzo, for example, lists amenities like indoor basketball courts, a 100-seat movie theater, rooftop sundecks, a sauna, and a free shuttle to and from the USC campus on its website.
Griffin, as a relative newcomer to the neighborhood, was surprised at the divide between student-oriented and community-oriented offerings in the area.
“If you go north, south, east, or west of the University two or three blocks … it gets very different,” Griffin said. “The actual campus area … is really cool. It’s kind of clean down here on Figueroa. But once you go south of the campus, and a little bit north, and a little bit east, it changes. And that’s how it’s been. Ten years ago, I don’t know if we could be standing right here at the corner of Adams and Figueroa having this conversation.”
A balance of costs and benefits
The shift in the neighborhood atmosphere doesn’t solely benefit students. With programs spearheaded by its late President Steven B. Sample, USC has dedicated significant resources to improving the University Park and South Los Angeles communities in recent years, and that extends to housing as well. 
As part of the USC Village development, the University has “pledged to donate up to $20 million to the City of Los Angeles’ affordable housing fund,” according to Craig S. Keys, USC Associate Senior Vice President for Civic Engagement and Economic Development. The city’s website says the housing fund’s resources are put toward “long-term loans for new construction or for the rehabilitation of existing residential structures through an open competitive Call For Projects process.”
The USC Village should lead to lower housing prices for students too, according to Keys. USC Housing currently provides residences for approximately 7,000 students, a number that has not fluctuated very much in the past five years. The under-construction USC Village will increase that number by about 2,700, which the University expects “should help drive down the cost of rent in the area,” Keys said.
The effect that the Village may have will remain to be seen, as the mixed-use development is not scheduled to open until the fall of 2017. For now, students and community members alike face rapidly-increasing rents.
As for Neubrand, she eventually decided to move to University Gateway next year because she felt it presented a better value than USC’s own offerings. But she remained dissatisfied with her options.
“I know I can get better for cheaper in other places,” Neubrand said. “I’ve read reviews of University Gateway and Tuscany and The Lorenzo, and people have a lot of bad things to say. Why is apartment housing and university housing so expensive when there aren’t many good things to say about it?

Plastered on the wall of Healy Hut, a small hut in one of the giant cabins at the Idyllwild Pines conference center, is a butcher-paper poster covered in quotes. At the top of the wall is a title: “Kids say the darnedest things.” The wall documents all of the ridiculous things kids say each year on the camping trip that Troy Camp provides for free for local elementary school students. 
Every year, the organization takes 200 third, fourth and fifth graders from Los Angeles Unified School District schools to a camp in the San Bernardino mountains. The week creates mentoring relationships between these students while providing them with new experiences such as hiking and horseback riding. The week is one of the many ways that the Troy Camp organization creates a massive impact on the growth and development of local children.
USC is home to hundreds of service organizations aimed to mentor and better the lives of the surrounding community — Troy Camp is one of these organizations. Focusing on the development of local children, the members of Troy Camp aim to provide a common ground between the University and its neighbors through a commitment to service and friendship. 
Troy Camp, one of USC’s largest philanthropy organizations, yields an impact that extends beyond just elementary, middle and high school programs in the community. The organization utilizes a one-on-one approach that aims to enrich the lives of each individual member personally, establishing bonds that don’t just last for the length of a school year, but for life. Through mentorship programs, after-school workshops and camping trips, Troy Camp is dedicated to creating a community between local students and USC students.
A personal approach
The organization fulfills their motto of being committed to friendship through their outreach and interactions with the youth of Los Angeles. The program is divided into three parts: Yearlong Programming, Leaders in Training and TC Leads. Although each branch of the program is different in its programming, all three retain the same goals of leading and inspiring.
“Beyond just tutoring and mentoring our kids, each camp counselor strives to be a positive influence, as not just someone they see once or a couple times a week, but as a role model and figure in their life,” said Olivia Chui, a Troy Camp counselor. “Every single day, there’s been opportunities to share and make the kids smile.”
The first program, Yearlong Programming, is an elementary school program catered toward the students who previously attended the summer camp in San Bernardino. Each month, the campers and their counselors meet up to go on trips to places such as Disneyland, the Los Angeles Zoo and the museums in Exposition Park. There are also special events for cooking holiday meals together and competing in an annual Olympics between different teams of campers. These activities — just like the summer camp — are free for all of the former campers.
Leaders in Training, the second program, aims at an older demographic of students. The program meets with middle school students every other week and leads them in leadership activities, group discussions and community service activities. The main focus of the program is to prepare middle school students for the transition into high school, and to create a solid base of study habits and leadership skills for students who might not have access to reliable mentors.
The middle school program leads into TC Leads, Troy Camp’s high school program. This after-school program is designed to continue building leadership skills while supporting students on their path to college. Each week, counselors work individually with students to help them through managing a high-school-level course load and applying to colleges. A main part of this mentoring process aims to help students find their passion and take the necessary steps to pursue it.
Every other week, TC Leads holds workshops to cover topics that range from college applications and interview skills to gender issues and social media. These workshops are meant to fill the gaps of topics that school curriculums often leave out and allow students to broaden their skill set and understand their own lives better.
All of these programs are completely free for the students involved, and each of them hold the same goal — to develop a mentoring community between USC students and local students in order to inspire local children to pursue higher education. This goal has been developed for decades by the organization, which is one of the oldest on campus.
Focused on support
Troy Camp started in 1948 when Otis Healy decided to sponsor a trip for several underprivileged local kids from the South Los Angeles area to camp in Jenks Lake. Since that year, Troy Camp has taken hundreds of local Los Angeles children on a memorable and free week-long camp every single year. They also form mentor and mentee relationships with the camp counselors from USC.
At the summer camp, students get to enjoy stations with a variety of activities like an arts and crafts station, a mad science station with science experiments and demos, a FAME station for dance and theatre, an Outdoor Exploration station for hikes, and Impact, a station that focuses on building important character traits such as trust and respect. A main part of the camp is a cabin where camp members get to take turns riding horses.
Between the camp in the summer and the extracurricular programs throughout the year, Troy Camp maintains strong bonds with all of its campers throughout their primary and secondary education. Chui elaborated that this is the key difference between Troy Camp and other volunteer organizations.
“The main difference is consistency,” Chui said. “[We] go to camp with the kids, but it doesn’t end there. We still stay involved and see them. There have been counselors who have stayed with their kid from elementary school up until high school. It’s really humbling to see these kids being involved and see them being involved in their journey from being in elementary until high school. Most counselors come back. It’s about being with them for every step of the way.”
While Troy Camp was created to make an impact on the youth around the community, it seems as though the positive influences are mutual. Many counselors feel that the time they spend with their mentees is just as helpful to themselves as to the student they are involved with.
“I think that Troy Camp opened my eyes to just the different personalities and perspectives on campus, which I really needed,” said Harrison Quan, a Troy Camp counselor. “Working with the students is always fun, to mentor and have some small sort of impact on their lives is super gratifying, not just for the kids, but for me.”
The silly jokes and memories written on the Healy Hut wall don’t just represent the ridiculous things that the kids at camp say. They also show how much each student enjoyed the adventure that the Troy Camp counselors gave to them.
Between all the ridiculous things the kids say like “virgintarian” instead of “vegetarian,” in the middle of the quote wall, one question reads, “What does Troy Camp mean to you?”
In small squiggly blue marker letters, it says, “The best family ever.”

With well-kept plants and an improvised fence to keep in the dogs, the house of 19-year-old Kimberly Paz and her family has a sense of permanence missing from most of the other housing options near the USC campus. Having lived here her whole life, she has grown along with the surrounding community, watching it evolve from a low-income, predominantly Hispanic neighborhood to one overrun by students.
“Oh, the area has changed quite a bit,” Paz said. “It’s different from living in some house, since you’re always with USC students and other activities. You’re kind of involved with them, so I personally like it.”
As the University has expanded, so has its place in the lives of locals. According to the USC State of the Neighborhood Report, the University spends $35 million annually to serve more than 40,000 community members through a variety of outreach programs and opportunities. Despite these initiatives, however, the community has changed drastically as students take the places of local families.
Swapping neighbors for students
Displacement is not the only problem that locals face; research conducted by the University indicates that as the local population not affiliated with USC decreases, the number of families facing economic and health issues increases. According to the State of the Neighborhood Report, 47.3 percent of families with children below the age of 18 in the University Park Campus study area were found to be living in poverty between 2008 and 2012. At nearly double the rate overall for Los Angeles — 25.2 percent — this is already an alarming statistic. But even more shocking is that the rate of families in poverty in the UPC study area has increased 11.5 percent since 2000. Though the University attempts to alleviate these issues, there is a foreboding negative trend accompanying student integration into the community.
David Tool, a former lecturer at USC who has lived in the area for 46 years, sits on the porch of the house that he and his wife bought when students were less of a defining characteristic in the area. Though he is a member of the Trojan Family, he remembers fondly a time when he was surrounded by something more than expensive temporary student housing.
“I have no neighbors left — I’m the only private house on this street,” Tool said. “The neighborhood is pretty much destroyed. It’s not something that the University has consciously done, it’s just that we’ve got students here and they rent these places for $1,000 a bed [per month].”
Tool, who is involved in several community initiatives such as the Student, Staff & Neighborhood Outreach Committee and the USC Neighborhood Network for Emergency Preparedness, emphasized that though the University actively supports the community, independent developers are incentivized by student demand to create short-term apartments and houses.
“When somebody turns a place into student dorms, many people don’t realize this is not the university that bought this, it’s the developers,” Tool said.
This creates a unique problem for the sustainable growth of the area. While the University is accountable to the community and to L.A. as a whole, private developers have every reason to maximize their profits. The demand for student housing is so overwhelming that developers are willing to pay astronomical prices for relatively small or older properties, incentivizing long-term families to cash out and move on. Every time one of them does so, however, it is an essentially permanent change — families move out and students move in, not the other way around.
Adapting to a student status quo
As more and more students move in to fill this student-oriented housing, the flavor of the neighborhood shifts and new issues for locals arise. Though Tool describes most students as very respectful, the dichotomy between college and family lifestyles inevitably leads to conflict, further detracting from the vibe of a friendly neighborhood.
Gerald Busch, a local who has lived in the area for more than 50 years and owns North University Park Property Management, has noticed the shift in demographics as well.
“Twenty years ago there were more black people, now there are none, pretty much. Ten years ago there were a lot of Hispanics, now there are none,” he said. “Those are local people.”
The gentrification and demand for the area around USC is not necessarily opposed by locals, however. Though the rate has dropped significantly since 2000, as of 2010, the UPC study area still has nearly double the rate of violent crimes than the city of Los Angeles as a whole — for longtime community members, the added security the University offers is a welcome change.
“I feel safer since there are always security guards around,” Paz said. “It’s more protected around this area.”
This spillover effect makes USC’s contribution to the community difficult to quantify. Busch has noticed how the University’s expansion and growth, meant for the benefit of students, inevitably has a positive impact on locals.
“[USC] provides a fantastic role in the community for lifestyle protection for the students and, by virtue of their density moving out past Vermont, protection of the whole neighborhood,” Busch said. “Then they’re offering the massive infrastructure of USC, a great learning institution and great cultural institution, and now it’s going to be a big commercial institution, and that’s open to not only the students but it’s open to a certain degree to the neighborhood.”
New surroundings, new environment
The construction of the USC Village, a core element of the University’s expansion into the surrounding area, will have complex and varied ramifications that remain to be seen. While the development will likely contribute to the gentrification that has come to define student influence, it could create a shift in student housing preferences that could benefit locals by reducing the immense demand for housing.
“When [USC] comes on with their new project, they’ll add over 5,000 beds, and they’ll be developing in the second phase a tremendous amount more,” Busch said. “ There are going to be much fewer students living off campus, it’s going to create a change in business.”
The Village, however, will impact far more than housing prices. For some locals, it has already caused issues by eliminating local businesses that used to be relied upon, such as affordable options for food that cater to families in the area. According to Paz, as the area has developed, there has been a decrease in stores that cater toward the Hispanic population, as well as an increase in food prices in general.
“The Village changed things a lot,” Paz said. “I was upset [about the Village] because that was our go-to place for markets and groceries and stuff, and now we have to go to other places like Ralphs, which is a bit more pricey. But we’re trying to cope with it.”
The proliferation of students into the area surrounding USC will come with positive externalities that could address many of the problems regarding safety, access to nutritious food and education that the area has formerly been criticized for. The sense of neighborhood and community that once existed, however, will surely be missed.
“My wife is a very good cook, so we used to have these dinner parties twice a month, and the neighbors would come over and eat and we’d make reservations for a play, or a concert, or some lectures and we’d all walk over together,” Tool said. “It was a wonderful way to get together, to share life with neighbors. But we can’t do that anymore … the neighborhood is pretty much gone.”
