The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, Sept. 5, and Friday, Sept. 6. 
Crimes Against A person
At 2:50 P.M. on Sept. 5, DPS officers assisted LAPD officers in searching for a non-USC man who had violated a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend. The male was not found, and both units cleared the scene.
at 1:56 A.m. on Sept. 6, a female reported to a DPS officer that a male student had grabbed her buttocks while she was walking. The female, who wished to remain anonymous, refused to remain at the scene, and the male denied to officers that the incident had occurred.
Crimes against property
At 4:33 P.M. on Sept. 5, DPS reported that a suspect used a sharp object to puncture the two passenger side tires on a student’s vehicle that was parked at 2325 Scarff Street.
at 6:28 p.m. on Sept. 5, a suspect took the front wheel from a bicycle locked to a bike rack in front of Leavey Library.
at 10:06 p.m. on Sept. 5, a staff member reported that a two-way radio owned by the department had gone missing between Aug. 25 and 29.

A USC graduate student has developed an app to analyze Twitter users’ geospatial data.
Chris Weidemann, a graduate student in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ online Geographic Information Science and Technology master’s program, has studied how much public geospatial data is created by Twitter users, and how others could use this information. Weidemann recently published his findings in the International Journal of Geoinformatics.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
About 6 percent of users have allowed Twitter to display their geospatial data, while others have permitted Twitter to publicly display their hometowns and time zones. Even for users with stricter privacy settings, information about location can be gleaned from the tweets themselves.
In order to get a more accurate depiction of what this data could show about tweeters’ locations and the tweeters themselves, Weidemann created Twitter2GIS, an application that analyzes geospatial data made by Twitter users.
“My intent is to educate social media users and inform the public about their privacy,” Weidemann told USC News.
According to the app’s data, a little more than 2 percent of tweets provided location data in the text of the tweets, while about four million users’ locations were revealed through the global positioning system.
Though this geospatial information could aid with marketing for corporations, it could also provide more opportunities for those with criminal intent.
As part of his master’s thesis, Weidemann is planning on expanding his application so that Twitter users will be able to see their own geospatial data. Right now, users can test out the application at Geosocialfootprint.com, but Weidemann will be working to improve the application throughout the rest of the year.
“This research has been fun,” Weidemann said, then added, “And a little scary.”

More than two decades after it was founded, the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative continues to aid students throughout South Los Angeles, and has recently expanded to two more schools.

The program, designed to prepare low-income students for the rigors of university education, has graduated over 700 students since its inception in 1989.
The program is spread out over seven years starting in sixth grade, and students involved must participate in both after-school tutoring and Saturday classes.
“It’s tremendous,” NAI Executive Director Kim Thomas-Barrios said. “It’s a seven-year commitment. You’re investing time into your future. You are actually holding onto the particles of your future in your present and that’s a beautiful thing to be able to say and do.”
If the students stay in the program from sixth grade until 12th grade and meet USC admission requirements, they receive a four and a half year scholarship to attend the university.
According to Thomas-Barrios, 41 percent of NAI graduates have attended USC, and 99 percent of all students have attended either a two-year or four-year university.
Tristan Baizar, a freshman majoring in accounting who went through the program, considers himself lucky to have had the opportunity to participate.
“They push us up to a status of being privileged. It’s just enriching all over,” Baizar said. “I guess you can say it’s a powerful thing to be able to go from what is called underprivileged to going to college debt-free for four years. “
Krystal Chavez, a freshman majoring in health and humanities and an NAI graduate, said she agrees with Baizar.
“The greatest part of the program is the resources that it gives us,” Chavez said. “Not many students, especially where we come from, are able to see the kind of atmosphere of this campus and experience the things we see.”
Graduation was an emotional transition for the NAI students, who had been attending school and working together since sixth grade.
“To make it to high school graduation and seeing the places that all of us get into is just amazing,” Baizar said.
Thomas-Barrios recalls the immense pride she felt in watching her students graduate.
“I had all the students stand up, turn to their parents, and say, ‘I can go to college.’”
Both graduates anticipate that they will give back to NAI in the future.
“Once you make it to a certain level,” Baizar said, “you should turn back and help people, you know, to pull them up to your level also.”
Currently, NAI is preparing to expand outside the South Los Angeles area. Just this past month, the program added two new schools, Murchison Street Elementary School and El Sereno Middle School. The additions increased the total amount of middle school students in the program by more than 100.
In regards to the program’s future, NAI hopes to double its number of graduates with its expansion to other neighborhoods.
“We have ripe opportunity with these children, especially the children coming from housing projects who do not have a program like NAI, who will come to them and say ‘here you go, you just have to work hard,’” Thomas-Barrios said. “I think that this will be a huge lift for that neighborhood.”
Thomas-Barrios encourages current USC students to get involved in the program, whether it be through after-school tutoring or serving as mentors to kids in NAI.
“It’s big enough where anything you would want to do, you can do. Any help that anyone would love to give, we’d love to take it.”

Findings from a recent study of 1,563 10th grade students conducted by USC public health officials revealed that social networking sites play a role in perpetuating teenage alcohol consumption and smoking.
“We’ve been interested for some time in trying to understand how friends influence each other in the adolescent context, particularly in school,” Dr. Thomas W. Valente, professor at USC’s Keck School of Medicine and the study’s lead investigator, said. “The purpose of this research was in part to understand the mechanism of adolescent smoking and drinking, and in part to help develop better methods of intervention for such behaviors.”
Based on long-term surveys of 10th grade students from Los Angeles County, Valente and his team found that teens in peer groups that did not drink alcohol were more susceptible to influence from online evidence of other peers engaging in risky behavior.
“The availability of negative peer influences is now increasing because you can have a lot of different types of friends online,” Valente said. “People who are susceptible to peer influence will be influenced by the people they are friends with online.”
Researchers said they were surprised by some of the discoveries. Despite teenagers being influenced by online friends, they are still more influenced by friends they spend time with in person.
“We did not suspect that seeing pictures of friends would have such a large impact on adolescent behavior because there is a boundary, the computer interface, between two friends who use online social networking,” said Dr. Grace C. Huang, one of the authors of the study. “We’ve seen, repeatedly, that in-person friendships allow risky behaviors to be shared more readily. Still, given the barrier present in online friendships, there is an association between online activity and risky teenage behavior.”
The study is not conclusive about any relationships between teenage behavior and use of social networking sites. It also did not find a link between a teen’s smoking and drinking and the number of friends that teen had on social networking sites.
And though the students surveyed were high schoolers, some USC students said that the results can apply to their own lives.
“Websites such as Facebook allow you to see pictures of people who are considered to be popular,” said Kathryn Rosenfeld, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering. “There’s always the want to get as many ‘likes’ as possible because the amount of ‘likes’ you receive quantifies your popularity.”
Others believe Facebook sets social standards students strive to reach.
“What you see on [Facebook] sets the norm and you try follow it,” said Nick Entin, a freshman majoring in computer science.
According to Valente, due to the nature of the survey, there is some bias. The study was only conducted in one school district, and only students who received parental consent could be included in the research.
“One of the things you have to do to conduct this kind of research is to obtain parental consent from each one of the students,” Valente said. “That creates some concern because the people that don’t get their forms signed might have a higher prevalence of the behaviors you are interested in. In other words, people who don’t get their consent forms turned in are more likely to be smokers or drinkers.”
According to Huang, further research could be done to determine further differences to friends students hang out with in-person, and those they are only connected with online.
Hi, i read your blog occasionally and i own a similar one and i was just wondering if you get a lot of spam feedback?
If so how do you stop it, any plugin or anything you
can suggest? I get so much lately it’s driving me crazy so any
support is very much appreciated.

Enhanced campus security measures were altered to accommodate large crowds for Saturday’s football game.
Last January, the USC Dept. of Public Safety instituted new measures including some restrictions of people on campus from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Typically,  students entering campus after 9 p.m. are required to show their student ID at eight of the 27 entrances  that remain open on campus. Due to the late start time of the football game on Saturday, however, those measures were adapted to accommodate large crowds.
“From the beginning we knew we would have to make exceptions on game day because of the vast size of the crowd and the impracticality of trying to screen anyone coming onto or passing through campus,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said.
According to Carlisle, campus restrictions were imposed again gradually Saturday night and Sunday morning, after it had been determined that the majority of fans were back on campus.
“At approximately 10 o’clock CSC — the private security company — began to close down some of the least-used pedestrian gates and by 11 o’clock most of the gates along Jefferson were closed. However, they didn’t do a complete security perimeter until 1:30 a.m.,” DPS Chief John Thomas said.
Students coming back on campus through different gates prior to midnight report having their IDs checked.
Brianna Pivo, a freshman majoring in biology said she and a group of friends left at halftime and went to Chipotle. When they came to campus just after 10 p.m. they were asked to show their IDs. Later, when the group came back from Gateway, they were once again asked to show their IDs.
“They were very clear about checking my ID,” Pivo said. “They always are.”
Freshman philosophy major Jenny Gilbert said that when she came back to campus just past 11 p.m. she was also asked to show her ID, but not everyone in her group was.
“They asked everyone to have their ID[s] ready but they were pretty casual about checking,” she said.
Though DPS intended to leave campus open until after midnight, the majority of fans exit through the gate on Trousdale Parkway and Exposition Boulevard after football games, so students going through other gates might have been asked to show their IDs.
“The main entrances on Trousdale and Exposition stayed open quite late as people were coming from the Coliseum,” Thomas said.
Despite this being the first football game since the implementation of new measures, Carlisle said officers had some experience suspending these measures as fans left the Galen Center after night basketball games last winter.
“We put extra staffing at that location and we monitored the traffic flow of pedestrians and cars, but we did not stop people and force them to show identification,” Carlisle said. “It would be impractical, very man power-intensive and [would] have a significant negative impact on the fans.”
Still, managing crowds after basketball games is a much easier task because of smaller crowds at the Galen Center, which holds more than 10,000 spectators, compared to the Coliseum, which holds nearly 95,000. On football game days Carlisle estimates that at least 30,000 tailgaters park on campus and thus need to be allowed back after the game.
Despite the large crowd, Carlisle said DPS typically does not see an increase in crime on game day.
“We have a large crowd of USC supporters tailgating and for such a large crowd, they’re remarkably well-behaved and civil,“ Carlisle said. “Campus security restrictions are designed to keep the thieves out; they’re not designed to keep fans away.”

Back in the day when I was 13 years old and just learning how to use iTunes, I would obsessively burn mix CDs for my friends. Graduation party? Mix CD. Birthday? Mix CD. Sad friend? Mix CD.
I was clearly a creative teenager.
But honestly, not much has changed, since one of my favorite pastimes is to put together Spotify playlists. So this semester, we’ll explore various genres and curate music together. From pop to country or R&B to reggae, you can find a unique lineup of oldies and newbies each week. Have a suggestion? Tweet me @RiniSampath.
This week, I made a playlist to help us bounce back from that disappointing loss this weekend against Washington State, so it’s time to bring the sunshine back into our lives. Tune into this collection of songs to de-stress and elevate your spirits. A combination of mainstream acts and underground gems, this playlist will have you bopping your head, tapping your feet and smiling at the little things that make the University of Southern California the sunniest university around.

1. “Faster” by Matt Nathanson
This Massachusetts-based folk musician rose to fame with his chart-topper, “Come On Get Higher.” Listen to “Faster,” from his album Modern Love, and you’ll find yourself addicted to his cheerful vocals, rhythmic handclaps and brilliant guitar riffs.
2. “Simple Life” by Casey Abrams
There’s a reason why this song is my current ringtone. Casey Abrams croons in his first verse, “Go get your butt off of that lazy couch.” So if you’re feeling particularly down with intentions of sitting in your bed all day with Nutella and Netflix, listen to “Simple Life.” You’ll want to hug your friends and dance in McCarthy Quad before you know it. And check out Abrams’ music video: It’s hard not to smile at the unexpected quirkiness of his dance moves. Though Abrams didn’t win American Idol, he’s stolen plenty of hearts and found great success following his reality-television stint.
3. “Hey Mama” by Mat Kearney
Dimension. Depth. Clarity. Those are the best three words to describe Mat Kearney’s voice. His simple rhyme scheme give his lyrics a kooky, elementary feel: “I met her at Anthropologie / Purple boots and her golden dreams / Standing there like a Tennessee queen.” “Hey Mama” is a wonderful track for any time of the year.
4. “Up Up Up” by Givers
You might recognize this song as one of many renditions by the Glee cast, but you might not know that it was originally composed by indie-pop group, Givers. But a season three episode of Glee wasn’t the first time Givers made an appearance on national television: Lipton Iced Tea picked upon their addictive tunes for one of their 2013 commercials. As the title implies, it will lift your mood up, up, up.
5. “Tip Toes” by Jayme Dee
If “Tip Toes” was an object instead of a song, it would be a large present wrapped in sparkly paper with millions of bows and stickers. Everything about it is a girly explosion of sparkles, but in all seriousness, when Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato get tiresome, give Dee a chance. Not only does she have California roots, but also Trojan blood: She spent some time studying at USC.
6. “Ladies” by Andy Grammer
He told us to “keep our heads up.” Now he’s reminding girls everywhere of their self-worth by singing: “Ladies, you are beautiful, you are beautiful / You don’t even have to try.” Andy Grammer clearly has a knack for happy music, so put on those headphones, go for a little bike ride and let Mr. Grammer’s sunny verses serenade you.
7. “The One You Say Goodnight To” by Kina Grannis
Like Dee, USC alumna Kina Grannis found fame through YouTube. Her music shines with a sense of innocence and purity unlike any other. In this selection, her lyrics are particularly endearing: “I will be the one you say goodnight to / Let me first say that you’re so charming / Don’t you think that you could use someone to charm?” Exploring other tracks off her album will lead to quite the crush on her production and personality.
8. “I Blame You” by Plug In Stereo
Don’t be mistaken. This title might have you thinking it’s a sad and sappy Bruno Mars single, but it’s actually a brilliant creation of curly-haired Portland soloist, Trevor Dahl (better known as Plug In Stereo). A steady drum beat, little touches of the electronic keyboard and cutesy “oohs” and “aahs” accentuate his youthful voice.
9. “Little Bitty Pretty One” by Thurston Harris
We’re about to wrap this playlist up with a nice throwback. Harris’ soulful voice accompanied by happy humming brings back memories of classic films like Matilda and The Princess Diaries, two contemporary movies in which Harris’ track was featured. Though he passed away nearly 20 years ago, Harris has left an unforgettable mark on the musical world. Give this song a go on your morning walk to class and BUAD 302 or WRIT 140 won’t seem as draining as usual.
10. “Send Me On My Way” by Rusted Root
Another classic song. Another track that’s recognizable thanks to the film Matilda. Tons of whistling, flute solos and lyrics that sound like complete gibberish, yet still have the capacity to make you feel like you’re floating on a cloud. Rusted Root, a Pennsylvania band, gained immense popularity in the ‘90s, but are still an excellent addition to any day in need of some more joy.

The archetypal modern love story of the high school jock and the unstable, yet beautiful young teacher has been told and retold in countless articles and cable TV specials. It is a tale that sheds light on troubling gender double standards in our society.

A Teacher, the new film written and directed by Hannah Fidell, which is available on iTunes and premiered commercially Friday, Sept. 6, brings these uncomfortable issues into a unique 21st-century context. It is the lead, high school English teacher Diana Watts (Lindsay Burdge), however, who steals the show in this provocative yet incomplete new film.
The opening scene, accompanied by a harsh all-string score, depicts Diana from the waist up jogging down a suburban street in present day Austin, Texas. Her composed, pretty face comes remarkably close to masking the disquiet lurking just beneath the surface. Over the course of the film, Diana’s face, rarely outside of the camera’s frame, is oftentimes more revealing than the film’s narrative structure.
Diana’s first romantic encounter with studly senior Eric Tull (Will Brittain) occurs within the first couple of minutes, without any kind of background as to how their relationship might have begun. Immediately, the viewer has a sense of being dropped into the middle of the story.
Scenes in the first half of the film are broken up by extended black transitions, suggesting the fragmentation of Diana’s life, and her dreamlike existence. These unique transitions suddenly cease when the couple breaks up during a trip to Eric’s ranch. Without Eric, Diana’s intermittent dream life becomes one extended nightmare.
One of the film’s most intriguing, yet frustrating scenes occurs soon after Diana’s first rendezvous with Eric, in a stylish Austin bar, where she meets her brother in his only appearance of the film. Diana’s brother speaks of their mother, who is apparently becoming senile. Then, out of nowhere, he tells her, “I’m worried about you.” Diana storms out of the bar, as the image blurs and the camera captures her departure from a variety of compelling angles. It is unfortunate that when the cinematography is at its finest, the storytelling is at its worst. Does Diana have a history of mental illness, or a degenerative disease or does she simply have mommy issues? One other obscure reference to her mother suggests the latter, but the lack of background makes it difficult to fully comprehend Diana’s exquisitely portrayed character.
Throughout the film, Burdge does an incredible job portraying Diana’s fragmented self without playing two characters. Diana’s voice becomes higher when she is with Eric, and her demeanor becomes eerily submissive. Diana is such a convincing high school girlfriend that young people can probably connect with many of the ways she and Eric interact. Perhaps it would be most accurate to compare the couple to a slightly sadistic senior jock and an impressionable freshman girl.
A Teacher, which is so artfully done in other ways, could have been great (though still perhaps a bit confusing) if Eric had been more of a sophisticated character. It is clear that while she was creating the film, Fidell wrote him off as an emotionless “bro-type,” who only cares about getting laid. At certain moments he is the swaggering, fun-loving prom king, at other times he is the sweet, ideal boyfriend and finally, by the end, he becomes abusive and apathetic. Obviously, as evidenced by Diana’s character, good cinema can accommodate multifaceted characters, but in Eric’s case each of his divergent facets is entirely built on stereotypes. Eric is a vehicle for Diana’s development, and a symbol of male dominance, but he is not a fully developed character. A romantic relationship, no matter how unhealthy, is composed of two emotional beings and in this film, Fidell only portrays one.
In a society that fetishizes female teachers who have affairs with male students, Fidell is attempting to reverse the score. In A Teacher, Eric is the object and the airhead, whereas Diana is the human, and — as Fidell portrays it — the true victim. The film ends very much in keeping with traditional gender discourse, however; Diana will carry the consequences of her actions for the rest of her life, while Eric, apparently unscarred and unremorseful, will start his life anew in college.

Thomas Wesley Pentz — popularly known as Diplo — took to Mid-City Wednesday night with artistic collaborator and long-time friend Shane McCauley for the Los Angeles opening of their new art show, “Blow Your Head.” The event took place at Sonos Studio located on La Brea.
Dipping internationally · Diplo took music from his favorite music blogs from around the world for his new exhibit “Blow Your Head,” which allows visitors to listen to tracks while viewing photographs by Shane McCauley. – Courtesy of The Windish Agency
The exhibition is a collaborative effort from the pair, who met 10 years ago when McCauley was documenting the ongoings of another band Wesley was in.
The duo’s latest project features music that Diplo — a self-proclaimed workaholic (“I’m always working on music”) — has personally selected from his favorite music blogs around the globe. Some of these blogs include OkayAfrica (South Africa), Mad Decent (New York City), Funk Na Caixa (Brazil) and Stolen Records (Jamaica). Mad Decent, which was created eight years ago, is one of Diplo’s two record labels, the other being Big Dada.
For this exhibition, Diplo’s music selections were paired with McCauley’s photographs, which were taken over a number of years as he traveled throughout the world, documenting multifaceted music scenes. Many of these photographs were portraits of ordinary people on the street, people dancing at concerts, and DJs playing sets. “Blow Your Head” uses Sonos Playbar, which is a device that combines music and images, and The Hype Machine’s global music discovery service to bring the vision together.
The intent — and the exhibition delivers — is to create a unique and global experience. Essentially, the pair hope to bring and share music and cultures with people who might not experience them otherwise.
More than the art show’s worldliness, what makes this particular exhibition unique is that no single person has the same experience. Visitors can pick and choose songs to their liking, which will thereby cue a specific set of photographs — they appear blown up in differing sizes and variations on either side of the walls — to accompany said music. As it is unlikely, though not impossible, that any single person makes the exact selections as another, each experience varies from individual to individual.
Accordingly, the exhibition feels immersive and interactive; it encourages visitor participation. The extent of how true that is, is relative to the individual — many in attendance at the opening didn’t have the chance to select a song.
But what was heard was interesting, under the radar and, as per Diplo’s personal music style, funky. Some of these songs were not recognizable to the average listener; Die Antwoord of South Africa, still low-profile but increasingly popular, is one of few exceptions.
After the crowd tooled around with the music and photography system, Diplo — wearing a floral shirt that showcased his dinosaur tattoo, quirky details that accompanied his surprisingly mellow and somewhat shy attitude — took to the stage with McCauley for a Q&A moderated by Emma Reeves of MOCAtv.
In their discussion, Diplo addressed criticism for what some would call the commodification of global culture — essentially taking music from other cultures, bringing it to the mainstream and using it for his own personal benefit.
For Diplo, it isn’t about taking advantage of other cultures, but simply sharing music across the globe.
“I’ve always tried my best to bring music to people,” Diplo said.
McCauley echoed that sentiment as he discussed the purpose and intent of the exhibition.
“It was important to represent that [global culture] in a visual sense and an audible sense,” McCauley said.
Diplo’s fascination with the music of other cultures is evident in many of his tracks, especially those of his collaborative act Major Lazer, whose first album with Switch was heavily influenced by the sounds of the Caribbean.
Perhaps Diplo’s affinity for “world music,” as people commonly label his mixes, comes from his anthropological studies in college. Perhaps it’s just a matter of personal taste. In any case, listening to Diplo in person can explain his motivations behind the exhibition and his own personal music, and his intentions seems sincere.
His passion for music, particularly that of South America, as he’s “fascinated by funk in Brazil and favela music,” filled the room. It was quite refreshing, really, especially since so many entertainers in the biz today are in it for the wrong reasons.
More than just the music itself, Diplo is excited about the prospects for this music to spread, which should happen easily given the ever-growing expansion of the digital music sharing.
“Everyone has a SoundCloud or YouTube,” Diplo said. “It’s amazing that people can get their music to the world so quickly.”
Whether Diplo is exploiting or sharing “global music” is decided by to the individual. But one thing’s certain: Like his style or not, Diplo is here to stay. And if “Blow Your Head” is any indication, we’ll be seeing a lot more of Diplo in an assortment of media.
“There really aren’t any boundaries to anything,” Diplo said, optimistically looking toward the future.

The No. 17 USC women’s soccer team traveled to Minneapolis, Minn. for the Minnesota Gold Classic hoping to remain unbeaten after a 3-0 start to its season. But after playing to a 1-1 draw on Friday against Ole Miss, the Women of Troy fell to LSU 1-0 on Sunday for their first loss of the season.
Stand strong · USC sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo anchored the Women of Troy’s backline that only allowed just two goals in two matches. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
USC (3-1-1) came into the weekend with three consecutive four-goal games, all resulting in wins, and the team’s best start since 2007. They hoped to carry that momentum into Minnesota, where they’d face two SEC opponents for the first time in the program’s history.
The team started out strong against Ole Miss (4-0-1), keeping the Rebels from getting a shot off in the first half while recording five attempts of their own. Unfortunately for USC, Ole Miss goalie Kelly McCormick was able to hold off the offense, keeping the USC attackers from getting into the rhythm they had from their previous games.
USC’s aggressive game plan paid off in the second half, as freshman forward Kayla Mills broke the scoreless tie in the 62nd minute from the far side of the box on a pass from sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink for her third goal of the season. Ole Miss matched the Women of Troy’s intensity, and responded three minutes later with a goal from senior forward Rafaelle Souza. Ole Miss outshot USC 5-3 in the second half, pushing the game into overtime.
Overtime played out in similar fashion to the first half, with Ole Miss unable to get a shot off, while USC failed to get a shot past McCormick. The Women of Troy tallied six shots in 20 minutes of overtime (three in each period), but were unable to put another one in the back of the net. McCormick finished the game with six saves against seven shots on goal, while USC junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley had three saves against four shots on goal, all in the second half.
“I thought we put forth a pretty solid effort defensively,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “I thought we did a pretty good job of taking care of the ball today, created some really good opportunities. I have to give Ole Miss some credit, too, for what they came out and did. We were good in the first half, they made some adjustments, but we should have put our chances away.”
Given the disparity in each team’s shot totals, it’s safe to say that USC should have been able to break through for more than just one goal.
“We just missed some chances. We hit the post, we hit the crossbar, we hit some right at the keeper,” Khosroshahin said. “It was our first real travel day, but we just didn’t finish our chances.”
The Women of Troy looked to get back on track against the Tigers (3-2-1), but were again thwarted by excellent goalkeeping. USC kept up its aggressive attack to the tune of eight shots in the first half, including three from sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo. LSU goalkeeper Megan Kinneman, however, kept USC off the scoreboard, picking up five saves. Senior midfielder Jordan Marada picked up a red card after a heavily disputed call in the 27th minute, the first of the season for the Women of Troy.
Like the Ole Miss game, the second half against LSU was a more even affair, with both teams taking five shots. The game would remain scoreless until a penalty kick from Kinneman in the 64th minute gave LSU the lead. The penalty was the Tigers’ only shot on goal for the entire game despite the one-player advantage.
USC picked up three yellow cards in the second half after getting only one in their previous four games. The Women of Troy outshot the Tigers 13-7 (7-1 on goal), and had 12 corner kicks to LSU’s 0.
Kinneman finished with seven saves to go along with the game-winning goal.
The Women of Troy hope to get back to their winning ways as they head back to McAlister Field for a four-game homestand. They’ll begin next weekend with games against Pepperdine (2-2-1) on Friday, Sept. 13 at 2:30 p.m. and Loyola Marymount (3-2-0) on Sunday, Sept. 15 at 1 p.m.

The Women of Troy put forth another impressive road performance over the weekend, winning the Marquette Challenge to improve to 6-0 on the season. USC knocked off TCU and host Marquette in a Friday doubleheader before dispatching of Northern Illinois 3-1 on Saturday, a week after notching three straight wins to capture the Mortar Board Premier Tournament in Indiana.

“The first thing that comes to mind was that the competition was very good this week,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “We had to travel to the Midwest last week and go back there again this week, so I’m proud of the way we played.”
Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio continued her opening-season tear with strong performances in each match to earn tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and senior libero Natalie Hagglund were named all-tournament team members, with Hagglund receiving the nod for the second consecutive weekend.
The Women of Troy received stiff competition from TCU in the opening match, but fended them off in four sets to win 25-9, 25-18, 24-26, 28-26. Bricio earned 23 points on 16 kills and two blocks, pacing a USC attack that quickly won the first two sets.
The Women of Troy earned quick leads in each of the third and fourth sets, after which the Horned Frogs came back to keep the score close. With the score knotted at 26-26 in the final set, the Women of Troy secured the win after a hitting error and match-winning kill by freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins.
USC’s outside hitters once again rose to the occasion later in the day, providing ample offense to spearhead a 3-0 sweep (25-16,  25-19, 25-14) of Marquette in the second match of the doubleheader. Bricio recorded nine kills and was complemented well by junior outside hitter Emily Young, who recorded a career-high tying eight kills and a stellar .583 attacking percentage.
The Golden Eagles kept the first two sets close, but the Women of Troy made quick work of the third set, storming out to a 22-12 lead before concluding the match on two Olgard kills and a Marquette hitting error.
“I thought we played well against TCU, even though we got glazed over because we were tired,” Haley said. “But we put together a very strong match against Marquette.”
The Women of Troy traveled to DeKalb, Illinois and needed everything within Bricio’s arsenal to fend off Northern Illinois in the tournament’s final match, as they came away with a 3-1 victory (25-22, 25-22, 19-25, 25-16) to continue their perfect start. Bricio recorded a tremendous 20 points on 16 kills to go along with two service aces and two solo blocks, while Ruddins and fellow freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu recorded eight kills each to supplement Bricio’s offense.
In their opening and closing matches, the Women of Troy dropped the third set but regrouped to take the fourth frame—a critical point of emphasis from Haley.
“The first thing that you ask is, ‘Why did you lose that set?’ Then you need to ask what changes need to be made,” Haley said. “Sometimes we change matchups instead of changing the lineup, and I think the team did a good job with that because it was the best opportunity for us.”
Young, a Schaumburg, Ill. native who celebrated her homecoming with three wins and a solid performance in the middle match, was particularly proud of the way the team kept its composure on the road yet again.
“This was our second trip to the Midwest, so we had to have more focus,” Young said. “Since school has started, we have our studies and we had three matches against good teams in two different locations, so it was tough.”
The Women of Troy will fly back to Southern California to participate in the USD tournament in San Diego Sept. 13 and 14, after which they’ll take on UC Irvine in their much-anticipated home opener  Sept. 18 at the Galen Center.

When USC head coach Lane Kiffin announced in July at Pac-12 Media Day that he’d be calling plays for the upcoming 2013 season, it made sense to me.
Sure, USC fans desperately wanted Kiffin to absolve himself of playcalling duties. But after last season’s 7-6 debacle, Kiffin knew that another disappointing campaign would result in his dismissal. And if this was to be the do-or-die year, he wanted to be in charge of his own destiny.
Well, he certainly made sure of that on Saturday night — and this do-or-die season is already on life support.
I wrote a column last fall after the regular season, defending Kiffin on the merits of his incoming recruiting class and even saying that his conservative playcalling near the conclusion of the Notre Dame game made some sense considering the circumstances.
But no one can defend the offensive disaster that occurred against Washington State, as Kiffin played incredibly safe and the ensuing results were unbelievably sorry.
Boos rained down in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as Kiffin led his team back into the locker room after one of the ugliest games in recent Trojan football history.
And yes, that includes last year’s fiasco of a season. At least last year included offensive highlights from Matt Barkley, Robert Woods and Marqise Lee. This year, the offensive playcalling hasn’t just been conservative — it’s been plain awful.
The elite talents of Lee are being wasted on screen passes that are commonly recorded as rushing attempts because they’re completed so far behind the line of scrimmage.
After the humiliating 10-7 loss, Kiffin defended the lack of shots downfield by pointing out the “drop-eight” scheme that the Cougars frequently employed on Saturday night, dropping eight players back into pass coverage and seemingly cutting off the Trojans’ vertical passing lanes.
“You’d like to think you’d run the ball pretty efficiently during drop-eight coverage,” Kiffin said. “It didn’t seem in our best interest to put a QB back there and let him get hit, let balls get tipped and have the ball turn over.”
Maybe not, but you can’t tell me that means the reigning Biletnikoff award-winner should be held to 27 yards on seven catches — against any team or scheme, really.
“I wish I would’ve had some opportunities to go deeper and stretch the field with Marqise and Nelson [Agholor],” Kessler said after the defeat. “Those guys have the speed that can get behind even the drop-eight.”
With Kessler and Max Wittek, Kiffin is in charge of two quarterbacks that were ranked as the Nos. 2 and 3 pro-style quarterbacks, respectively, in their class by Yahoo! Sports. While watching USC’s team scrimmages this fall, I saw Wittek loft several beautiful deep balls to Lee and Agholor and witnessed Kessler’s shifty mobility in the pocket and pinpoint accuracy on intermediate routes across the middle.
These feats came with the disclaimer that USC’s defense might not be that good, that the pair’s success against their defensive teammates could just be a product of another underachieving defense.
Well, if there’s anything positive to say about this team, it’s that its defense is undoubtedly far better than last season’s.
I shudder to think what the results of the Trojans’ first two games would look like if Clancy Pendergast hadn’t been installed as defensive coordinator, bringing along with him a relentless scheme that has forced turnovers and sacks by the bushel to keep USC in both games they’ve played this season.
And against that unyielding defense, the two quarterbacks combined to go 28-for-42 with 449 yards in the team’s final scrimmage.
Admittedly, the quarterbacks weren’t subjected to the same amount of pressure they’d see in real games, since in scrimmages they were ruled down as soon as a defensive lineman touched them. But those stats at least show that Kiffin wasn’t afraid to test his gunslingers’ ability to throw deep balls, and they mostly passed the test.
Surely they could have at least come close to replicating those results against the likes of Hawai’i and Washington State — right?
What’s more is that even if Kiffin resolved to primarily call run plays against the Cougars, why couldn’t he at least split more touches between redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden (32 carries), freshman Justin Davis (2 carries) and the rest of the Trojan backfield (zero touches)?
Kiffin said several times in preseason camp that USC’s running back depth was the best he’d had in his four years at the helm. But, time after time, Madden was sent to bowl over the Cougars’ front seven, and it might be endangering his health.
“Thirty-plus [carries], that’s a lot,” Madden said after the game. “I’m pretty banged up right now.”
Kiffin needs to rely less on Madden and put more trust in his pair of quarterbacks next week against Boston College. If he doesn’t, he’ll continue to compromise the prestige of the entire USC football program.

Heroes: Matt Lionheart, President Reggie Bush, John McKay Jr,, Pat Haden, John McKay, Howard Jones, John Robinson,  Pete Carroll and all the others!
Sir Haden & McKay, 
as members of the ’72 & ’74 teams, you are without a doubt two of my favourite heros of all time, as are members of the ’72 Dolphins.
Born in California but raised in southern Florida it had been my dream to attend Southern Cal, since the age of 5, but when I attended  I was tortured by the presence of Larry Smith. 
I beseech you to remove this current impostor of a head coach and hire someone within the family (if you could hire anyone I would want it to be Schnellenberger, but as you know he has retired), he was an embarrassment to the ethos of football in the south, and is now an embarrassment to our school. Please end the torture and get rid of that damn yankee.
Fight On!

And Lame is also seemingly destroying a Trojan Heisman candidate for the second consecutive season?! This was totally unfair to Matt Barley and now Marquise Lee is going to be his next victim?  
Football is another educational program of the University, and any teacher who cannot develop his students, who, indeed, undermines their potential, should be dismissed!!
I agree. Lane – focus on recruiting & get a creative offensive coordinator that will keep defenses guessing.
As a fan of USC football for 60 years, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing last night.  Does Kiffin believe in a vertical passing game?  Based on last night, I don’t think so.  I am not talking about 40 yd bombs; what about a 15 to yd post etc.  WE NEVER SAW ANY OF IT. His offense last night was all too predictable.  If you can’t stretch the field, and insist on dinks, dunks, and the run game, you are much too predictable.  After the game, Fox interviewed the defensive back who made the tnterceptioN of Kessler’s pass right before the half.  He said he knew the rout SC was running and was able to break on it based on film study. i HAVE ABOUT HAD IT WITH KIFFIN”S EXCUSES; YES THE DEFENSE IS MUCH IMPROVED.  THE SPEED AND TACKLING ARE 100 PERCENT BETTER OVER LAST YEAR, BUT IF YOU HAVE NO OFFENSE, YOU PUT WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOUR DEFENSE.IF WITTEK AND KESSLER CAN’T DO IT, LET’S GET A LOOK AT MAX BROWNE.  ALL OF THESE GUYS WERE TOP QUATERBACKS IN HIGH SCHOOLAND  WER E VERY CAPABLE OF A VERTICLE PASSING GAME.  WHY CAN’T WE SEE IT NOW?  Coach Kiffin, being a full time coach is a very demanding job; perhaps you should consider giving up calling plays; based on what I saw last night, you did a really lousy job.   iF THINGS DON’T CHANGE AND FAST, IT WILL BE HASTA LA VISTA BABY

For the second consecutive week, USC’s defense dominated, creating turnovers and sacks just when it seemed the opposition was close to putting points on the board. But on Saturday, the Trojan offense offset all of these positives created by their counterparts on the other side of the ball en route to a 10-7 defeat at the hands of Washington State, marking the first time the team has lost to the Cougars at the Coliseum since 2000.
Not enough · USC redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Maddden (23) was the Trojans’ sole form of offensive production in the team’s 10-7 loss to Washington State. Madden finished with 151 rushing yards on 32 carries. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In a game that was bereft of any offensive consistency from either side, big plays were the difference — and the Trojans produced hardly any.
No USC offensive play went for more than 20 yards, and no pass play gained even 10 yards as the Trojans gained just 193 total yards on offense. Redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek combined to complete 11 of 21 passes for a measly total of 54 yards, with each throwing a costly interception.
After a poor punt from Washington State gave the Trojans the ball at the Cougars’ 39-yard line with a chance to extend the 7-0 lead just before halftime, Kessler mistimed a quick slant and threw behind sophomore receiver Nelson Agholor. Washington State cornerback Damante Horton intercepted the misfire and returned it 70 yards untouched to tie the game.
“Obviously that’s not what I wanted to happen on the play but I was just trying to get the ball out before I got sacked,” Kessler said. “It was one of those things where you kind of throw it blind to where you want [the receiver] to break, and I threw it a little behind [Agholor].”
Horton solidified his hero status for the Cougars by picking off another pass from Wittek on the Trojans’ final drive of the game to seal the upset.
The second interception followed the Cougars’ only successful offensive drive of the night. After Washington State receiver Dom Williams picked up 49 yards on a screen pass from Connor Halliday to the USC  30-yard line, the longest play of the entire game, kicker Andrew Furney converted a 41-yard field goal with 3:03 to play to put up the Cougars’ first offensive points of the night.
“We played lights-out defense versus a [pass-heavy] system that’s put up a bunch of numbers over the years,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “Unfortunately, we were really poor on offense.”
Washington State played conservatively on defense all night, often dropping eight men into pass coverage in an attempt to limit big plays.
Kiffin seemed more than happy to oblige to the Cougars’ strategy, calling for 41 running plays and 21 passes, most of which were short routes and screen passes behind the line of scrimmage.
Kiffin’s suspect playcalling, a much-maligned subject over the past two seasons, elicited boos from enraged USC fans throughout the game, as running plays were called many times in third-and-long situations that rarely resulted in first downs for the Trojans.
USC was only 3 for 13 on third-down conversions in the game. But Kiffin defended his conservative strategy.
“When you drop eight [players deep] that’s gonna close up lanes in the passing game,” Kiffin said. “We [were effective] at times, but then we’d shoot ourselves in the foot.”
Despite the offense’s inability to maintain an effective drive, the Trojans’ defense held strong until the final minutes of the fourth quarter and even helped create USC’s only points of the game.
A pair of big gains by Washington State had the ball down to USC’s 33-yard line before a holding penalty and a sack by senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin pushed the ball back past midfield. On the next play, redshirt junior defensive tackle George Uko sacked Halliday and forced a fumble, which was picked up by senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard and returned to the Cougars’ 22-yard line, giving the Trojans great field position.
Two plays after redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden converted a fourth-down run to get the ball inside the 10-yard line, Kessler rolled out to his right to pass but had enough space in front of him to scamper into the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown run to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead with 9:59 left in the second quarter.
Madden was the lone bright spot on USC’s offense, as he became the first USC running back to gain 100 yards in the first two games of the season since 1981 Heisman trophy winner Marcus Allen. Madden rushed 32 times for 151 yards for an average of 4.7 yards per carry and also converted all three of USC’s successful third down attempts.
Madden admitted in his post-game press conference that he felt banged up after having his number called over 30 times in just his second collegiate game at tailback. Including the 12 yards he gained on two receptions, Madden accounted for 163 of the Trojans’ 193 yards on offense — the lowest USC output since 1998.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee, whose Heisman chances are all but gone, gained just 27 yards on seven catches.
“I’ve never seen stats as bad as we did today,” Kiffin said. “That’s very discouraging and obviously that falls on me, so we’re going to fix it.”
The team did manage to slog into field goal range on Wittek’s first two drives to open the second half, aided by a few Washington State defensive penalties and Madden’s solid performance in the backfield.
But junior kicker Andre Heidari’s 32-yard attempt on the opening possession of the half was blocked, and his 43-yard attempt on the Trojans’ next drive went wide left.
As the clock wound down and fans trudged up the stairs and outside the Coliseum, a deafening chant of “Fire Kiffin!” echoed throughout the stadium.
“I think I heard those [taunts] before the game during warmups even, so I’m getting used to it,” Kiffin deadpanned. “It is what it is … You really can’t worry about that.”
If Kiffin truly isn’t distracted by the criticism that will surely surround him over the following week, that’s a good thing. Judging by the team’s performance against the Cougars, the entire USC staff and team have a lot of other concerns to iron out before the Trojans’ game next week at home against Boston College.

How can this be happening?     SC is all I have in my life!  It is the only way I can gain respect from people up here in northern cali where Cal and Stanford rule the world.
I need to have SC win — otherwise my life is worthless — so make it happen!
Just a very disappointing game again.  We travel several times a year to games but will think twice while Kiffin in still in place.  The guys don’t believe in themselves and you can see it on the sideline, no energy.   It comes from the TOP – Down.  If your coach is not confident and up for a win, then the team will not be either.  I never see the guy crack a smile.  We love USC and this is just hard to see happen (again!).
Go for broke, Lane.  Open up the play book now that you’ve named a starting QB.  Could the results be any worse than last Sat.?  I’ve always supported you, but this last game was gut-wrenching.  Wazzu’s best weapon was our offense.
I am not an alumnus of S.C. But have followed the Trojans for over 45 years. The game against Washington St. was very disappointing and the only one to blame is the head coach. Young scholar-athletes play as they are taught at practice day in day out. Our Trojans do not have any leadership, pride, and a will to compete and succeed. Mr.Haden knows what a winning Coach must do to get these highly touted recruits to play tough and physical football , as when he played for Coach John McKay. The drawback who would replace Coach Kiffin if you fire him now? The Alumni, students, and parents deserve better than what we have. We must do better Pat! Fight On!

It is simple. It is over for our wonderful legacy if Kiffin stays any longer. We have gotten worse each and every game. He has destroyed so many players chances for the pros, he has send the top recruits running from us at warp speed.
It is clear to me, football must not matter to the school anymore and they don’t care how bad it gets or how low we go. We are un ranked and have a coach that does not believe in his guys and in turn they guys are deflated and have lost their drive for the play.
Texas has a back bone, they did what was needed this week, Pat, show us your believe in the guys and in our legacy, your legacy and fire Kiffin; yesterday. We are not going to be able to recover if it goes one more game.
Fans and alumni money is running out the door, but I guess that doesn’t matter either.
What will it take to man up and get it done. We are already a totally embarrassment and getting worse by the second.
Care about the guys, care about the school, care about the legacy and get this set right, NOW!!!
Wrong Lane is paid $4 million per year for what?
The answer seems pretty clear:  In the Kiffin era the defense has been horrible.  Daddy Kiffin is replaced and the defense improves immensely.  Now Sonny Boy Kiffin is running the offense, which is as inept as any in the past history of Trojan Football.  
The answer seems apparent to everybody but Pat Haden: Fire Lame!!
Excellent recap of the game.

On Aug. 3, California residents received news via text message about an abducted girl in a blue Nissan Versa. The public initially knew very little about Hannah Anderson and the details of her disappearance: she’s a 16-year-old blonde from San Diego, and was last seen at cheer practice and was suspected of being taken by James DiMaggio, her father’s best friend. In spite of the lack of information, the widely broadcasted search for Anderson and her abductor captured the public’s attention. And though the nation breathed a collective sigh of relief when Anderson was found in the Idaho wilderness, many are still wondering how such a calamity could have even happened.
Though some time has passed and the Anderson story has faded away in light of other, more pressing news, there are many things that the public can learn from this tragedy. Most importantly, society should recognize that similar problems can be provided by taking cautionary steps. James DiMaggio was Anderson’s father’s best friend and like an uncle to Hannah and her brother Ethan, according to The Huffington Post. The thought of DiMaggio ever doing anything to harm the Anderson family was ridiculous to anyone who knew them, but there were several warning signs that were brushed off.
In an interview with CNN, Marissa Chavez, one of Anderson’s good friends, said that when she, Anderson and DiMaggio were in a car together, DiMaggio told Hannah that he would date her if she were his age. This type of comment is extremely inappropriate, especially coming from an uncle figure. Hannah and her friend brushed this comment off, agreeing later that it was slightly “weird.”
According to Child Find of America Inc., relatives other than the non-custodial parent abduct 21 percent of kidnapped children. Though DiMaggio was not related to Anderson by blood, he was close enough to the family that Anderson and her brother called him “Uncle Jim.” This statistic is proof that no matter what the relation is between a child and an adult, anything could happen.
Anderson and DiMaggio once took a trip to Hollywood together but returned home after only two days into their week long journey. According to CNN, DiMaggio was upset that Anderson “wasn’t paying enough attention to him.” Despite the close relationship DiMaggio had with the Anderson family, he was not blood related. A trip like this crosses a major boundary between an adult man and a teenage girl.
The warning signs should have been taken seriously. The public should be observant, be aware of boundaries and tell someone when these boundaries are crossed. It’s not for certain that this tragedy could have been prevented, but the family would have definitely been more wary of DiMaggio’s intentions had they been more aware of the subtle warning signs.

Since taking office last December, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has shown that he means business in the ensuing war against drug cartels. The capture of Miguel Angel Treviño Morales, the leader of the Zetas cartel, in July is a serious victory and shows that Mexico is focusing more on high-level traffickers and killers — the people most responsible for the violence, according to the Wall Street Journal. The government must continue to adapt its approach to drug violence in order to focus on preventative policing instead of responding to violence with more violence.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
In response to the 90,000 dead in the seven-year war on drug cartels started by the Felipe Calderón administration, the Mexican government has been rapidly increasing the capability levels of police forces deployed to fight against the cartels. Ten thousand of these national police, whose creation was announced by Peña Nieto’s administration last December, resemble Special Forces soldiers more than they do beat cops. The United States has provided assistance in waging this war, giving these troopers CIA training and flying unmanned aerial drones to provide scouting and intelligence reports on cartel movements, according to The Atlantic.
But the advances that the Mexican government has made militarily against cartels will not stop the violence unless the government follows up these military gains with beat-cop policing. In industrial cities such as Ciudad Juarez, which in 2009 had the dubious honor of being the most violent city outside a war zone, according to the Houston Chronicle, Mexican army troops and federal police forces make regular sweeps to target armed bands of cartel drug runners and thugs; yet there are no beat cops to create sustained law and order in the cities afterward. According to Australian counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen in his book The Accidental Guerilla, constant monitoring is the only way to stop these kinds of criminal elements from gaining a foothold in cities such as Juarez and thus keep the peace.
Granted, the war on drugs has a long history of leaving police officers and their families regularly targeted for executions by the cartels in an attempt to intimidate local cops and encourage them to stay out of the fight against cartels. And though the streets of Juarez were too violent and dangerous for beat cops even just four years ago, sustained efforts by the ultra-trained and heavily armed national police have made the streets just safe enough for beat cops to return to patrolling for crime. The return of regular cops is a long-awaited step in Mexico’s war on drug gangs.
Their arrival and subsequent return to normalcy is long overdue that Mexican vigilante squads have begun to form to defend their towns and provide some law and order, writes the Foreign Affairs. Only real cops with training in working with local communities can ensure that drug cartels can never again gain a foothold with the local population.
Cartels and drug-related careers can be appealing in Mexico. Though Mexico’s industrial sector has benefitted magnificently from the increased trade with the U.S. through the North American Free Trade Agreement and movement of industrial products through Juarez, citizens in the rural farming communities of Mexico have been left behind by the rapid industrialization. Naturally, Vanda Felbab-Brown says in her book, Shooting Up, that it’s natural that people with the fewest job opportunities but with farming experience and equipment are willing to begin growing drugs. Similarly, youths attracted by the cartel lifestyle and by the glorification of crime by narcocorrido (folk music with lyrics on the subject of drugs, violence, revolutions and more) rappers are willing to trade bleak job prospects and a failing education system for macho weaponry and the chance to earn a fantastic living running cocaine through South America and into the U.S. A return to regular policing will give communities and educators the chance to improve the otherwise failing Mexican infrastructure enough to give rural communities better opportunities in legitimate trades. Regular policing represents a return to normalcy and an opportunity for economic growth.
The only way for Mexico to maintain the hard-won gains against violent cartels is to bring back regular policing. Otherwise, the pull of the drug lifestyle is too strong and the violence will continue.

Young man. You touch on an incredibly weighty subject.  And like most, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Mexico’s is not an issue with drugs; it’s a problem of poverty, corruption and globalization in which your own government is complicit above all others.  It’s not a war on drugs as far as the U.S and Mexico are concerned.  It’s a war for drugs.  Without drug money Mexico goes bankrupt and the U.S loses DEA, and large portions of other national security agencies.  Read Charles Bowden’s Murder City.  Mexico is no sovereign political mechanism.  It is run by a one cartel and it’s muscle criminal organization called the Mexican Army which is financed by 1 bln Merida dollars in annual U.S money.
U.S citizens need to lay off the crack pipe. If there is no demand there is no supply. U.S citizens  and their insatiable appetite for drugs victimizes the people of Mexico. What the U.S needs is Columbia a neighbor.

For the second consecutive week, USC’s defense dominated, creating turnovers and sacks just when it seemed the opposition was close to putting points on the board. But on Saturday, the Trojan offense offset all of these positives created by their counterparts on the other side of the ball en route to a 10-7 defeat at the hands of Washington State, marking the first time the team has lost to the Cougars at the Coliseum since 2000.

“30-plus [carries], that’s a lot, and it took a toll,” Madden said. “I’m pretty banged up right now.”
Including the 12 yards he gained on two receptions, Madden accounted for 163 of the Trojans’ 193 yards on offense — the lowest USC output since 1998.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee, whose Heisman chances are all but gone, gained just 27 yards on seven catches.
“I’ve never seen stats as bad as we did today,” Kiffin said. “That’s very discouraging and obviously that falls on me, so we’re going to fix it.”
The team did manage to slog into field goal range on Wittek’s first two drives to open the second half, aided by a few Washington State defensive penalties and Madden’s solid performance in the backfield, but junior kicker Andre Heidari’s 32-yard attempt on the opening possession of the half was blocked, and his 43-yard attempt on the Trojans’ next drive went wide left.
As the clock wound down and fans trudged up the stairs and outside the Coliseum, a deafening chant of “Fire Kiffin!” echoed throughout the stadium.
“I think I heard those [taunts] before the game during warmups even, so I’m getting used to it,” Kiffin deadpanned. “It is what it is … You really can’t worry about that.”
If Kiffin truly isn’t distracted by the criticism that will surely surround him over the following week, that’s a good thing. Because judging by the team’s performance against the Cougars, the entire USC staff and team have a lot of other concerns to iron out before the Trojans’ game next week at home against Boston College.

My apologies for the typos. I hate the iPad2’s keyboard…..
OK, Mr. Haden. Now’s the absolute lastest time to have a heart to heart with CLK, and tell him to give up play calling. There is so mich talent on this team, offensively, and he’s not using it. There are 7 offensive coaches, I believe, and this lack luster, Sun Bowl like offense is not what USC is about. We are not a 2nd rate football tram, yet you allow Kiffin to make it one. 
Tere are two reason why I stopped giving money to the university.
1.  Not accepting freshman, with excellent grades and high SAT scores as freshman and telling them to go somoewhere else for their freshman year. And this includes the son, daufhters and frqndchildren of USC grads or SCions…. All in favor of incrrasing the foreign atudent population from Asia.
2.  Keeping Lane Kiffin as Head Coach after the Sun Bowl.
Last night thr team on the sideline looked like the team at the Sun Owl and the offense played that way too. Tere wasn’t any energy on the USC sideline.
Haden, what is it about Kiffin that you refuse to take corrective action? Is his contract so tight that if you fire him before the 4 yrs are up, the early firing clause pays jim significantly more money? Well, you’re losing money by keeping him here.
It’s time to cut bait Mr. Haden. You’ve been fishing for results in an empty Lane, uh errrr, lake.
Fight on.
