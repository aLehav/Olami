After a Senior Day win over No. 3 UCLA Nov. 6, No. 2 men’s water polo sputtered in the MPSF tournament this weekend. The Trojans dropped the first-round matchup against the Bruins 6-5 and defeated No. 1 UC Berkeley 11-9 for a third-place finish.
The MPSF semifinal was the opposite of the Senior Day game. The game began with quick-paced, back-and-forth scoring. UCLA struck first, forcing USC to play catch up. The Trojans were able to answer each Bruin strike in the first quarter. Each side scored a penalty shot, and they entered the second period tied at 3-3.
Whistles plagued USC in the second quarter. The Trojans conceded on two power plays, including one that saw senior goalie Nic Porter excluded from play. USC gave away a penalty with 39 seconds to go in the second period, and the Bruins netted the five-meter attempt to make it 6-4.
USC couldn’t capitalize when the refs’ calls went in its favor. UCLA completely shut the Trojans out on 11 of its 6-on-5 plays, and the Trojans finished the half with a 6-4 deficit.
“[We need to be more] aggressive,” Head Coach Marko Pintaric said. “Our team was more aggressive against [California] the day after, and it showed … It’s something that we will address and work on in preparation for the NCAA Tournament.”
USC cranked up the defensive intensity in the second half against UCLA, as Porter kept a clean sheet in the last 16 minutes. The Trojans stole the ball three times, and senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt parried away as many shots. But, their offensive struggles continued. Redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube set the table for graduate student 2-meter Wyatt Barker in the middle of the third to make it 6-5. The Bruins held off the Trojans for the remainder of the third and fourth periods, eliminating USC from the MPSF title race and sealing the 6-5 defeat.
In the third-place game, it was more of the same neck-and-neck competition with Berkeley as the game remained close until the fourth quarter.
With the score tied at 8, redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep took control of the game. Mercep found sophomore driver Carson Kranz for a goal and then fed Daube for another. He increased the USC lead to 3 goals as he scored one himself with just over a minute left in regulation. The Bears got one back, but it wasn’t enough, sealing the win for the Trojans.
USC earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament despite losing to UCLA. The team will await the winner of Thursday’s game between UC Davis and Long Beach State.
“Our job is to really do the background search and to really put the players in a better situation,” Pintaric said. “I’m glad [our mistakes at this tournament] happened, and that we have another tournament to correct that.”
USC’s first tournament game will be the semifinal Dec. 4 at UCLA.

When Wändi Bruine de Bruin began researching, she focused on psychology and behavioral science, studying risk decision-making and communicating with people to help them make informed decisions. As climate change became an increasingly pressing issue and Bruine de Bruin observed its severity, she aspired to frame her research around the damage threatening the environment in a way that everyone could understand. 
This research was presented at the 26th “Conference of Parties,” Climate Change Conference, hosted in Glasgow, Scotland. Held from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, with 40,000 people attending from across the globe, the conference intended to find ways to avert climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the world. USC faculty and students were present both in person and virtually at the conference, many of whom worked on studies related to climate information and lasting effects of climate change. 
Bruine de Bruin virtually presented her findings that focused on communication and the public’s understanding of climate change terminology.
The project was supported by USC Dornsife Public Exchange, a Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences organization that connects research projects to the United Nations.
“My main message to climate scientists, climate journalists and climate communicators is to use everyday language and explain what you mean,” Bruine de Bruin said. “If [they] must use those difficult terms, explain what they mean in the context of climate change … for people who want to better understand climate change.”
Bruine de Bruin’s study found that the average person does not understand climate change jargon as well as experts assume they do, even if the terms seem simple. Bruin de Bruin’s report intends to help scientists, journalists and policymakers classify environmental science in simpler terms to enhance the general population’s understanding. 
Bruine de Bruin created an additional guide posted on The Conversation, a digital news publication, that defines typical climate change terms for those listening to the conference or trying to educate themselves about environmental problems.
“[My research team and I] were anticipating that some of the terms would be difficult to understand, but what was surprising was that even very commonly used words [were not understood],” Bruine de Bruin said. “We actually found that all of the words we tested led to some confusion, even [what participants ranked as the] easiest term of the eight that we tested, ‘abrupt change.’”
Bruine de Bruin was not the only USC staff member observing the conference.
Shannon Gibson, associate teaching professor at the Dornsife department of political science and international relations, selected four students to attend a five-day retreat at the Wrigley Institute on Catalina Island to track COP26. The team focused its research on the effect of coronavirus, protests and grassroots activities on conversations surrounding climate change.
Gibson said she believes that civil society’s influence has redefined the public’s views on climate change. 
“[Protests] serve a purpose, too, which is to show that, as much as the United Nations is seen in a very positive way by the majority of countries and people out there, there is a question of their legitimacy and their effectiveness for us to get climate change deals that match pace with the ecological changes that we’re dealing with,” Gibson said.
One of Gibson’s students, Kirian Mischke-Reeds, a senior majoring in international relations and the global economy, said there have already been protests as large as 100,000 at the conference advocating for further action.
“[There have been a] large amount of protesters in Scotland, there have been demonstrations, there have been activists, there have been people doing more radical things like chaining themselves,” Mischke-Reeds said. “A lot of the action has been in the street and on social media but muted back compared to previous years.”
Some environmentalists such as Gibson believed that the coronavirus pandemic would make people more aware of the problems in politics, economics and the environment. Gibson she believes that the coronavirus’ emergence would encourage people to specifically acknowledge the links between health concerns and environmental degradation, but she found that this connection was not as prevalent as previously believed.
“Climate change and new pandemics go hand in hand; this threat of zoonotic diseases and things like that,” Gibson said. “I had hoped and thought that the health perspective was going to be more prominent. And as we’ve talked to colleagues that are [at the conference] today, we’re finding that it’s not. We don’t see that much mention of these health concerns as they relate to climate change.” 
However, Murad Jah, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said there was more civilian mobilization and passion surrounding this years’ conference.
“Studies and things have changed, and I feel motivated with this COP,” Jah said. “I think that comes a lot from the media presence. With everything being online, we’re more attached to our phones, we’re attached to voicing our opinions online because you can’t go to class.”

When Luis Rodriguez-Perez, Sabrina Dimesa and Lauren Malkoun uncovered artifacts in the tomb of Marcus Venerius Secundio, they felt a mix of emotions. 
“It was amazing, some of the artifacts that came out,” said Rodriguez-Perez, a senior majoring in archaeology and history. “But it’s also really crazy and really kind of ethically challenging, because as cool as it is to uncover artifacts a few thousand years old, you remember that these were like human beings and people who actually lived.” 
Rodriguez-Perez, along with Dimesa, a junior majoring in economics, and Malkoun, traveled to Pompeii, Italy, this past July with ArchaeoSpain, a company that allows students to join archaeological trips and digs. They were paired with the “Pompeii: the Archaeology of Death” project and studied funerary archaeology.
Malkoun, a sophomore majoring in archaeology, had previous experience with ArchaeoSpain, from when she joined an excavation trip to Spain in high school, which jumpstarted her passion for archaeology. Malkoun hopes to participate in more excavations in the future, with the goal of pursuing a doctorate degree in archaeology. 
“You connect with the site on a whole other level,” Malkoun said. “You don’t realize it until after when you’re like ‘Oh whoa, I know a lot of things.’”
During the trip, the three worked with 13 other archeology students from around the world, in addition to professional archaeologists. From 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, participants worked on site in the Porta Sarno Acropolis — located outside the Eastern gates of Pompeii — or in a lab inside the gates, documenting their findings. Weekends were spent on excursions exploring other archaeological sites in Italy, Malkoun said.
During the excavation of the Marcus Venerius Secundio mausoleum — created to commemorate a former slave and priest — students assisted in digging and documenting findings from the site. Before the diggers uncovered the tomb and exhumed the body, a small hole was made to insert a camera to help anticipate the findings and components of the tomb. 
Inside the tomb, they discovered not only Secundio’s body, but also several urns — one fully intact that was made of glass and enclosed in a metal protective casing. According to Malkoun, archaeologists are analyzing the urns with new techniques more deliberately, as opposed to conventional methods of dumping their contents.
Secundio’s tomb also featured inscriptions in Greek, despite its location in Rome, where the majority of people spoke Latin aside from a few rich citizens, Rodriguez-Perez said. Secundio organized theater performances while he was alive, and the inclusion of Greek inscriptions suggested that theater was performed in Greek. 
“This was an important finding … because this is confirmation that Greek was a well enough understood language to have been performed outdoors,” Rodriguez-Perez said. “I think it’s the first [inscription] of its kind.” 
Lynn Dodd, associate professor in the practice of religion and spatial sciences and director of the Archaeology Research Center, has taught Rodriguez-Perez and Malkoun before and encouraged both of them to go to Pompeii. 
“I thought that would be an exceptional opportunity for them. I thought that it would be great fieldwork training,” Dodd said. “It’s important for archaeologists to learn field methods and to get hands-on experience.” 
Malkoun said she hopes to put the lessons around empathy, respecting the past and cherishing archaeologists’ work into practice in her career. 
“You can’t separate people from science because it’s about people, and so I think it’s important to remember, as we go through this process, as we continue to talk about the finds at Porta Sarno and Pompeii, to remember Marcus Venerius Secundio and his family, we’re all people too,” Malkoun said.

Back when I was in high school, I watched “La La Land” while also studying for my honors chemistry class. That probably wasn’t the most productive manner of studying, but in many ways, the movie became my motivation to study. As I listened to the soundtrack during car rides and tracked down places where the film was set, “La La Land’s” setting solidified my dream of wanting to come to Los Angeles. 
Like the characters in the movie, I wanted to be discovered. I imagined that if I was good enough, I could achieve my dream. It was a fantasy. Yet I have to give that fantasy credit for being at USC today.
Search up “films about Los Angeles” and “La La Land” is sure to pop up. For all the criticism of the film, it remains emblematic of the L.A cinematic imagination. Directed by Damien Chazelle, the film tells the story of a relationship between aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) and jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), each one pursuing their own dreams in the “City of Stars.” 
There’s a theme in the film about what it takes to achieve success and to manifest one’s dreams as an artist. Mia goes through audition after audition. Sebastian plays music he doesn’t want to be playing in the hopes that one day, he’ll have enough money to open his own jazz club. When Sebastian gets a life-changing opportunity, his success ultimately puts a strain on the two’s relationship. The romanticized life deteriorates. At the end, both achieve their career goals but end up losing each other.
Dreams and their symbolic nature are central to the narrative. Chazelle expresses that with “La La Land,” he wanted to focus on illuminating the “texture of the city,” specifically capturing the distinct qualities of the city and its people. 
“Society makes fun of L.A. a lot, but there’s something worth celebrating about that — this idea of dreamers,” said Chazelle in a Metro interview. “It’s the going after them that gives the characters meaning, and gives the city meaning, too.”
Despite the fact that “La La Land” has been written about extensively, I wanted to end “Reel LA” writing about the movie because its themes are central to those of this column. Illusions and reality are foregrounded in “La La Land,” which is about two dreamers. Sure, you could say that the plot’s driving tension is whether or not Mia and Sebastian will become successful, but I would argue that it’s the conflict between the fantasy of being brilliant and the realities of becoming brilliant. 
In one particular scene of the film, Sebastian drives to Mia’s house in Nevada, where Mia has retreated to after the failure of her one-woman show. Sebastian has received a call from a casting director who wants Mia to audition for an upcoming movie. Mia, however, has lost her confidence and believes that going to the audition will have devastating consequences. 
“Maybe I’m not good enough,” she tells Sebastian. “You change your dreams and then you grow up. Maybe I’m one of those people.” 
What I think is important about the film is that it manages to depict the deep insecurities rooted in being an artist. It prides itself on the illusions that great artistry necessitates. Maybe we’re all familiar with that feeling: We’re afraid to be bad at something, and so we don’t put effort into it or just don’t do it at all. 
At USC and outside of it, maybe we know what it’s like to not feel good enough, or know that we aren’t good enough. We don’t want to face the reality of our dreams not coming true, so we choose to believe that those dreams aren’t that important. We negate their worth and tell ourselves we can live without them. In doing so, we ignore the fact that our dreams are what make us visible to others, whether it’s someone asking us what we want to be when we grow up or what superpowers we wish we had. 
If art is about passion and emotion, then so are dreams, and I’d argue that dreams themselves are a form of art. The fact that Chazelle’s movie celebrates movies projects those dreams into our lives as moviegoers, as an audience and as dreamers. It’s an element true to L.A., a city where the glamorous fantasy of the movies is often equivalent to the urge to be seen. 
“La La Land’s” love story isn’t particularly innovative, and the plot occasionally falls flat. Yet visually, the movie is stunning. Maybe that’s representative of the vividness of dreams, I don’t know. I do think there’s something to be said about a movie that, like the fantasies it evokes, is more beautiful than it is substantial. 
The way I see it, the L.A. of “La La Land” is like the night sky: full of stars. Sometimes, some stars might seem brighter than others. Still, though, they all exist. 
Valerie Wu is a junior writing about film, television and visual culture in relation to Los Angeles. Her column, “Reel LA,” ran every other Monday.

Students wandered around Taper Hall Friday night, admiring Descent Magazine’s second issue and celebrating the organization’s first in-person event since its founding during the coronavirus pandemic. The issue, themed “develop//deconstruct,” featured a variety of artistic mediums, including short stories, poems and photography. 
Flipping through the magazine’s online issue on the several computers dispersed across the room, attendees finally had the chance to see the colorful, eclectic and scrapbook-inspired issue. Co-editors-in-chief, Long Le and Nancy Liu, introduced the issue and its contributors, many of whom gave short speeches explaining the inspiration behind their work. 
Conceptualized at the end of 2020, Descent Magazine is USC’s first Asian Pacific Islander Desi American arts magazine and officially launched in January 2021. Digitally published every semester, Descent is sponsored by media companies that highlight a multitude of Asian American experiences, including Kaya Press, Lantern Review and Just Like Media. 
The magazine’s title is also a homophone of “dissent,” a word most often used in the context of social change, Liu said. As the name suggests, the magazine aims to “encourage people to think more critically” while simultaneously honoring past ancestors.
In the wake of increasing anti-Asian sentiment and the Stop Asian Hate movement, Liu said it was even more important to provide space for Asian representation in the magazine and in publication spaces on campus. Determined to create a platform that allowed for APIDA creatives to freely express their ideas and cultural identities, Liu invited Le and, together, founded Descent Magazine. 
“We started before the #StopAsianHate movement really started last spring, but it’s really influenced how we’ve moved forward with the magazine,” said Liu, a senior majoring in public relations. “[The movement] showed us just how political we are as an arts magazine. Art is inherently political, especially when it’s about identity.”
Descent, which is completely student-run by members of the APIDA community, looks “to elevate and amplify APIDA voices by nurturing a space where they can showcase their artwork, stories and other creations,” according to their website. 
Acknowledging the lack of APIDA representation in publications on campus, Le embraced the opportunity to lift up APIDA artists at USC through the founding of Descent. 
“I’ve always wanted to do something more for the APIDA community at USC,” Le said. “I found that this was a really interesting and creative way that I could get involved.” 
While the publication started out small, Liu said Descent has since expanded its  team and reach this semester by taking on staff photographers and writers and developing a tighter-knit community. 
Staff writer Echo Tang, a junior majoring in quantitative biology, contributed a collection of short stories titled “it comes and goes.” Tang’s stories all share a common theme about the loss and revaluation of relationships, though the stories largely feature nameless and faceless people.
As an in-house contributor to the magazine, Tang has found a space to embrace and develop her creative writing skills — something she does not get to do often within the academic restraints of her major. 
“USC doesn’t have any APIDA arts collective, and I am a quantitative biology major, so I don’t get to do this stuff a lot and I don’t get to write for myself a lot,” Tang said. “I wanted to take this chance and explore my own creative voice, and some of my own ideas and thoughts in a space I thought was safe for an individual like me.”
For staff writer Jamie Ma, Descent has allowed APIDA students to discover a space to embrace invention and share their work with the USC community at large. Descent’s issue includes a short story by Ma about the sociopolitical implications of interracial relationships involving Asian women. 
“I joined Descent … because I wanted a place that focused on my identity and my creative work in conjunction with each other,” said Ma, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies and East Asian languages and culture. “Descent, to me, recognizes the idea that all writing is autobiographical — my writing cannot be separated from my identity as an Asian American woman, and to produce work that is meaningful requires a creative freedom and support that I felt I could only or mostly get from Descent.”
Ma hopes to illustrate the multifaceted nature of the APIDA community, which is often labeled as the model minority. She said while the one-dimensional, studious stereotype largely defines views of the Asian community, in reality, there is much creativity the APIDA population has to offer. 
“Descent is also the perfect environment and reminder to the student body that we, the APIDA community, are a people worthy of celebration,” Ma said. “We are intelligent and hard-working, yes, but we are creative and imaginative and artistic too.”
Though Le, a senior majoring in film and television production, described himself as not well-versed in publications, Descent Magazine has successfully launched two issues since the pandemic; the inaugural one in April centered around the theme “Liminal Spaces.”
In the new issue’s letter from the editors-in-chief, Le and Liu said the theme is meant to “reflect on established systems of the world and deconstruct and develop them to serve the world better.”
“We are one in the line of generations of Asians and Asian Americans, and so, the idea of ancestry and passing on a legacy is really important to us,” Liu said.

On Oct. 1, the world got its first hint that Adele was back. After six long years without an album, mysterious billboards displaying “30” cropped up in major cities around the world. Adele’s hiatus was finally broken when her sing “Easy On Me” dropped Oct. 15 and subsequently took over the airwaves.
“Easy On Me” is the most traditional Adele song on “30”’s 12-song tracklist. It features much of her past hits’ unrestrained belting and simple yet elegant piano production. Much of the other 11 songs are infused with more R&B and soul elements than Adele has explored before. Lyrically, “30” is much more raw than her past efforts. The album’s lyrical content is influenced by her 2019 divorce from Simon Konecki and the difficulties of explaining it to their nine-year-old son, Angelo.
Exemplifying this new direction, the album’s saddest song is “My Little Love.” Adele pens an open letter to her son, “I’m holdin’ on (Barely) / Mama’s got a lot to learn (It’s heavy) / I’m holdin’ on (Catch me) / Mama’s got a lot to learn (Teach me),” she sings on the chorus. 
However, nothing can compare to the heart-wrenching emotions conveyed by the short voice memo conversations she has with her son that are scattered sporadically throughout the song. “Mummy’s been having a lot of big feelings recently / Like how? / Just, like, hang on, my fingers are trapped / Like, um, I feel a bit confused / Why? / I don’t know / And I feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing / Oh, at all? / At all,” Adele confesses. “Tell me you love me / I love you a million percent.”
“30” strays away from Adele’s tried-and-true formula. She experiments with strikingly different and new sounds on “Oh My God.” Its production has an almost electronically infused humming backdrop which is complimented perfectly by Adele’s attention-grabbing vocals as she flits back and forth between her softer head voice and the sheer power of her belt. “Maybe, baby, I’m just losing my mind / ‘Cause this is trouble, but it feels right / Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell / Is a battle that I cannot fight,” Adele sings about trying to be true to herself and protect her marriage as the uptempo, pop-infused, staccato claps that accompany the chorus pull listeners back into the verses.
“Can I Get It” is one of the most upbeat songs, lyrically and instrumentally, on “30.” Accompanied by guitar strumming and thumping drums, its chorus is infectious and poppy and is my best guess for “30”’s next radio takeover.
“Easy On Me” has already spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100. “30” is projected to sell over a million units in its first week, and will be the first album to do so since Taylor Swift’s “reputation” in 2017. It’s clear that Adele remains a pop culture phenomenon, but her impact is felt far outside the bounds of chart performance.
Less than a week after its release, we are already feeling the effects of “30”’s rollout. Spotify announced on the morning of Nov. 20 that they had updated their software. When playing an album, the default is now for the tracks to play in order, as opposed to on shuffle, because of Adele’s feedback.
Though soaring, production-heavy tracks in the likes of “Someone Like You” and “Rolling in the Deep” are missing from “30,” they’re only briefly missed. We get a new Adele, an Adele who honestly opens up and expresses her unfiltered emotions, an Adele who draws inspiration from calmer R&B tracks instead of pop powerhouses. It’s not the Adele we were expecting, but seeing her evolve as an artist over 10 years into her career is fulfilling and exciting. There’s no telling where she’ll go next, but, luckily, we have the emotionally complex, musically different “30” to explore in great depth until then. We might have to wait awhile for new music though, “See you in seven years,” she joked when promoting the album on Vogue’s 73 questions.

We’re back on USC sports just in time for a rundown of the basketball team’s strong start and the aftermath of football’s rivalry game Saturday. Wishing our readers a great Thanksgiving, but before we can get to break, let’s break down USC sports.
Gary Bryant Jr. steps up
In a game with few bright spots, sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. had himself a day against UCLA. The wide receiver had 161 receiving yards and a touchdown, racking up almost as many yards as he had in his previous three games. His production may not have led to a USC victory , but he looks ready to step into the junior wide receiver Drake London-shaped hole in the offense.
Boogie Ellis’ do-it-alldebut
The sophomore transfer from Memphis shined in USC basketball’s opener against Cal State Northridge. Ellis flashed his range with a deep three to put the Trojans up 20-13. A steal later in the half let him show off his hops on an empathetic Victor Oladipo-esque breakaway jam. 
He capped off his 20-point debut with a tough finish off the glass.
Trojans defense returns
Despite currently sitting right at the edge of the AP’s Top 25, men’s basketball is comfortably within the nation’s top -25 defenses. According to KenPom’s adjusted defensive efficiency rankings, the Trojans sit at No. 16, a mark almost as high as the No. 6  ranking they posted last season. 
Some defensive regression was expected after USC lost freshman forward Evan Mobley to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA draft, but if they can keep this up, they’ll be a force to be reckoned with in the Pac-12. 
Goals in spades
The USC women’s soccer team kicked off its 2021 NCAA tournament with a bang against GCU, winning 6-0. A hattrick in under five minutes by junior midfielder Croix Bethune set the tone for the rout and a couple of goals in a few minutes right after halftime finished it off. The dominant performance at home matched the program’s record playoff margin of victory. The Trojans battled Penn State in the second round but lost in heartbreaking fashion in a penalty shootout. 
Super senior turns super scorer
Men’s basketball redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin has stepped up to the plate in his fifth year and become a featured scorer in USC’s offense. After playing a smaller role in the season-opening blowout over CSUN, Goodwin has chipped in with 19- and 20-point games against tougher competition. He’s producing those points efficiently at a career high 67.7% field goal percentage, a marked improvement on the 53.8% he posted last year.
Dunk city gets dunked on
Men’s basketball Head Coach Andy Enfield returned to his old stomping grounds last week with USC’s trip to Florida Gulf Coast. Enfield established his reputation in Fort Myers, building the “Dunk City” team that electrified the 2013 NCAA tournament on its way to the Sweet 16. No electrifying upset came for this year’s edition of FGCU basketball though, as USC easily dispatched Enfield’s former team.
Picks aplenty
Is USC and UCLA combining for 4 interceptions evidence of good football being played? Opinions diverge, but most would agree those steals make for an entertaining game.
USC football shuts UCLA down for 10 minutes
The rivalry game’s opening stages were promising on one side of the ball for the home team. For all of 10 minutes, the Trojan defense stood strong, grabbing 2 interceptions on their way to a 3-0 scoreline. For the purposes of this column, it would probably be best if we didn’t cover what happened next. 
Women’s soccer takes home half of the Pac-12 awards
The Trojans boasted three of the six award-winners voted on by the league’s coaches. Senior Penelope Hocking went back-to-back, winning Forward of the Year. Junior Croix Bethune took home Midfielder of the Year and Head Coach Keidane McAlpine got in on the fun with Coach of the Year honors.
Anti-Prank Activities
There’s a long history of pranks between the two premier universities in Los Angeles, and there’s not a better time than rivalry week to pull those tricks off. Fortunately for USC, the fearless Trojan Knights and Helenes were on duty all week to thwart any vandalism attempts by force. Freshman Knight Jose Torres, who slept at Tommy Trojan for three nights last week, said he was “honored to be a part of something that goes all the way back to the ’40s. It’s just a fun time.”

USC is home to diverse, social and multicultural organizations: the Political Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly, Service Student Assembly and more. These clubs promote the values of particular campus demographics and reflect students’ unique backgrounds. 
However, the Undergraduate Student Government isolates a particular community, even though it makes up a significant portion of the school’s population: the military.
USC’s latest report indicates that the school has about 192 undergraduate students and over 850 graduate students who are veterans, on active duty or serving as national guardsmen or reservists. 
The University hosts Reserve Officers Training Corps programs to assist students in qualifying for commission in the United States Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps, with more than 200 Trojan alumni ranking as general officers or senior civilians in the Department of Defense. 
In addition, USC is a Yellow Ribbon institution, covering 100% of tuition that the Post-9/11 GI Bill (which helps veterans and their families pay for higher education and training programs) does not already cover. In addition to this aid, USC hosts a dedicated Veterans Resource Center that helps veteran students in higher learning, academics, graduation and career success. 
However, the school’s military sectors are disconnected. Air Force ROTC rarely interacts with Army ROTC unless cadets happen to pass one another on Cromwell Field. Most ROTC cadets hardly ever meet a veteran in their time at USC. GI Bill recipients feel disconnected from the greater Trojan community. 
The Veterans Association that strives to smoothen USC student veterans’ transition to campus life. However, the organization is geared toward the veteran community and does not heavily emphasize ROTC students, GI Bill recipients and individuals from military families. The Veterans Association is also the only military-orientated student organization on campus. 
It is crucial that USG permits a government body to coordinate activities and pool resources for all military-affiliated Trojans. A military student assembly will set up special interest committees and community-focused programs, thus promoting inclusivity, diversity, military education and history, culture and networking.  
Students connected to the military can rely on this assembly as a vital support system. For instance, in his tips for veterans going to college, Tim Stobierski, Northeastern University contributing writer, writes that veteran students need “people who will be there for you when things are challenging or when things don’t go according to plan.”
Whether fellow veterans, senior ROTC cadets or military instructors comprise this support system, the assembly’s experienced individuals will desire the academic success of any military-orientated person and provide an altruistic environment for them. 
A USC military student assembly can look for inspiration from American University’s Military-Connected Club, which is open to all students regardless of military affiliation but specifically welcomes ROTC, Active Duty and dependents. The club aims to represent the military student population at American University and voice concerns to the schools’ staff and faculty. Thus, USC needs to prioritize such military-inclusive programs, which would keep students’ academic experiences in trajectory with their social experiences.
Additionally, student assemblies can create opportunities for guest speakers of that particular group. For example, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly hosts speaker events with prominent guests of Asian Pacific American descent. Along with the Speakers Committee and Political Student Assembly, APASA hosted comedian Hasan Minhaj in 2018 to discuss “embracing differences.”
A military student assembly could host influential guest speakers, such as former 1st Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command  four-star Gen. Keith Alexander or two-star Gen. Angela Salinas, the first woman to command a Marine Corps Recruit Depot and first Latina to obtain the rank of a general in this military branch. These figures have first-hand knowledge and experience that can inspire and educate military students. 
While USC has done well in providing for their military-affiliated Trojans, there’s always more to be done. A military student assembly, heavily promoted by the University and USG, could be the way to truly serve and support these students.

In middle school, my teachers all seemed to have one thing in common: a fiery hatred for Wikipedia. They adamantly labeled Wikipedia as a good “jumping-off point,” but an unacceptable source of information. The disparaging comments against Wikipedia affected me up to college, where I wouldn’t even glance at the site while conducting research papers.
Recently, I’ve realized Wikipedia’s value, and I feel inclined to rectify past wrongs and wage a campaign in defense of its sullied name. In a world full of inaccurate news and division, Wikipedia symbolizes successful collaboration and openness. 
Long ago, a magical thing called an encyclopedia existed. You could open a book, leaf through the pages and find an answer to your question. With the advent of the internet, you can find the same information with the touch of a button, sans heavy books. When the encyclopedia’s musty pages disappeared, consolidated, easy-to-access information’s value did not. 
For over 20 years, Wikipedia has served as a digital encyclopedia, a one-stop shop for all different kinds of information. Because information changes and evolves quickly, it takes time to create a new printed edition with updates. Wikipedia, on the other hand, can provide and edit up-to-date information in the blink of an eye.  Today, Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world, with information in over 300 languages covering countless topics free to users. 
With an estimated 1.7 billion websites available on the internet, Wikipedia sets itself apart by providing information on the most niche topics. For example, when my mathematically-inclined roommate looks up information about advanced theorems, Wikipedia has entries about them, whereas other sites max out at high school calculus.
As a nonprofit, the Wikimedia Foundation provides funding for Wikipedia. The Foundation’s mission is “to empower and engage people around the world” and disseminate information “effectively and globally.” 
Through Wikipedia, Wikimedia fulfills its mission with the help of a global cohort of volunteers, known as “the community.” Although my teachers distrusted the volunteer’s ability to write and update articles, Wikipedia has a system in place to ensure factual entries. 
Every entry on the site links to a “talk” section that shows the process of editorial decisions, and allows readers to see reasoning behind certain facts’ inclusion. Additionally, Wikipedia has strict requirements for publication: Information must be presented neutrally, verified by an outside source and not based on original research. In 2018, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced that YouTube would use Wikipedia excerpts to combat misinformation. 
If a billion dollar corporation can use Wikipedia as a source, why can’t I? 
Despite these processes, we still must double check what we read on Wikipedia with other sources, just as we would with everything else on the internet. I will admit, even with protections in place, I’ve seen a few false, comedic changes on Wikipedia. For example, when Former House Speaker Paul Ryan faced criticism for not standing up to former President Donald Trump, people called him “spineless,” with someone going so far as to add his name to the list of invertebrates on Wikipedia. However, Wikipedia offers overall accurate information.  
Wikipedia’s nonprofit model ensures a degree of validity over other for-profit corporations. As a nonprofit, the site relies on its foundation rather than visits to the site for funding. As a result, Wikipedia doesn’t need extremism nor clickbait to trick people into engaging with their content. 
The website’s mission is to spread information. When profit is a main priority, truth becomes less relevant. If Wikipedia allowed ads, for example, it would be worth up to $5 billion dollars, but it remains steadfast in its commitment to its mission. 
Wikipedia, unlike other sites, doesn’t hesitate to delete entire entries with false information. Facebook and Google don’t delete information because data is essential for machine learning and training programs. In addition, for-profit platforms make money off targeted ads through collected data. 
Therefore, when a company such as Facebook strives for profit above all else, deleting data is akin to lighting cash on fire. Instead of deleting an untrue post, Facebook simply flags it, keeping the data intact and therefore available for dissemination, which spreads misinformation.
Given the internet’s tendency to troll, I readily believed my teacher’s warnings about a site where the average Joe contributes and edits facts about the most important moments in history. Today, it feels as though large groups of people on the internet eventually succumb to partisanship and anger. Indeed, it’s in this precise climate that Wikipedia is a particular beacon of hope for collaboration. 
Research at Harvard Business School found that Wikipedia reduces ideological segregation and maintains good neutrality. On Wikipedia, people feel more inclined to engage with other viewpoints. Rather than an individual post that falls into the abyss of Facebook, Wikipedia posts become part of public record. Therefore, its role carries more weight than a careless post on social media. Wikipedia doesn’t work without experts in particular topics talking with and respecting one another. 
By allowing everyday people across the globe to participate in defining history, Wikipedia could create a more equitable, democratic society. Personally, I don’t want only the most powerful people with access to the biggest publications writing history. 
When organizations equate readers to money rather than valuable members of a community, misinformation becomes a likely outcome. In defiance of past teachers, I want to give a shout out to Wikipedia: It proves that it’s possible to share information in a collaborative and informative manner on the internet.
