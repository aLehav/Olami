The award is given annually to one male and one female collegiate basketball player who accomplishes notable achievements in four areas of excellence — character, classroom, community and competition.
The senior is entering her third season as a team captain for the Women of Troy, and has also been named to the preseason top-30 list for the John R. Wooden Award, given annually to the most outstanding men’s and women’s basketball players. She’s started every game for USC since joining the team as a freshman.
Harberts, who is majoring in human performance and minoring in nutrition and health promotion, is a two-time Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention and has a 3.23 GPA.
Last season, Harberts was an All-Pac-12 selection after ranking third in the conference in points per game (18.0) and sixth in rebounds per game (8.2). She also led the Women of Troy with 34 blocks, 37.2 minutes per game and a 43.8 field goal percentage.
Harberts won a gold medal this past summer in Kazan, Russia as a member of the United States’ World University Games team.
She enters this season ranked as USC’s No. 16 all-time scoring leader with 1,293 career points, and will resume her climb up the leaderboard next Friday in the team’s opener on the road against UC Davis.
Harberts is one of four Pac-12 women’s basketball players to make the candidate list, which will be narrowed down to 10 finalists halfway through the regular season. Coaches and fans will then vote for one male and one female recipient, and the winners will be announced during their sport’s respective 2014 NCAA Final Four.

Though I can’t say this for a fact, I doubt I would need much more than my two hands to count the number of basketball games I have attended at the Galen Center during the past three seasons. I actually tried to go back through old schedules and figure it out, but the problem is that my USC basketball experiences have been unmemorable. In fact, over the last three seasons I could only find four games I could say with certainty that I attended — and three of those were during my freshman year.
Hands on approach · Part of USC’s men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield’s new job is drumming up interest in the team as he inherited a program with apathetic fans left hopeless by former head coach Kevin O’Neill. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
I remember walking out of Galen Center after some game last year — can’t remember which, of course — but some game, probably a loss, and thinking to myself, “I’ve never left a USC basketball game and thought, ‘I’m glad I went to that.’”
Strictly speaking, this isn’t true. I distinctly remember USC’s upset of No. 10 Arizona back in the 2010-11 season. For once, Galen’s atmosphere that night actually surpassed that of my high school junior varsity team’s games.
But seriously, “high school” is probably an appropriate comparison to the crowd at Galen the last few years. If you were to close your eyes at a game, it would be pretty difficult to tell that there was a Division I sporting event taking place there. Actually, even with them open, it was pretty difficult to tell that at times — and I’m not just talking about the 6-26 squad in 2011-12.
Remember the “court storming” after the Trojans again upset No. 11 Arizona last year? I put it in quotes because to call it a court storming would be an insult to places where they actually do storm courts. What were there, 15 students out there? It was kind of fun to see, sure. But really it was just embarrassing.
This year, of course, is supposed to be different. There’s a hot new coach to talk about in Andy Enfield. There’s a tangible buzz around the program, freedom from the dark days of former head coach Kevin O’Neill. The two coaches are about as polar opposite as you can get: O’Neill was a fiery, defensive-minded screamer, for lack of a better term. Enfield? All you really need to hear is that his old team was nicknamed “Dunk City.”
In the same way the USC football team seems to be having more fun after the firing of former head coach Lane Kiffin, the basketball team seems freed under Enfield. Their half of the “Trojan Tip-Off,” a public scrimmage played last Sunday, looked like the NBA All-Star Game with the amount of dunks being thrown down (not to mention the absurd lack of defensive effort). They, too, were having fun, something that’s been sorely lacking across Figueroa for some time now.
So yes, the excitement is valid. Coach Enfield is a fun guy. He’s quite the up-and-comer. He went up and down The Row on Monday, popping in at a few Greek chapters trying to drum up support and awareness for basketball season, which you might be surprised to learn tips off in eight days (I know I was, which was sort of his point). He made a couple of drinking references and sort of joked about students coming to games perhaps a little inebriated. People seemed to like it.
But he also asked for suggestions on what would entice them to come to more games. There was a litany of ideas thrown out there: cooler T-shirts, more pizza, better seats. Obviously serving beer was popular. But there was one suggestion that stood out above the rest.
“Win.”
Ultimately, that’s it. Fan support should be above average for the first few home games. It might linger a little longer than usual because of the more exciting and just plain watchable brand of basketball that will be played. But at a certain point, it won’t matter if every point USC scores is off a triple alley-oop reverse dunk. At a certain point, you have to win.
Any good fan — and I assume the program would like good fans — would rather watch a 45-40 win over any given team than a 77-76 loss. Sure, that latter result occasionally might be more fun because of the pure thrill and excitement of a close, high-scoring game. But if that becomes the norm, it won’t matter that the losses are in shootouts as opposed to the grinders of years past.
Enfield already has good support, based in no small part on the fact that he is not Kevin O’Neill and actually encourages his players to dunk. But there is only one way to get the support — especially fan support — he really wants.
And no, it’s not dunking.

JUST WIN BABY! The faster pace will excite and we do need to paly defense. Up tempo with defense will work. I know that all of you are too young to remember the 19701971 USC basketball team. 24 and 2 was our record, the second best team in the Nation. We played defense and we could fast break. It was exciting basketball. look it up and I hope we can move our program in this direction soon!

USC basketball recruit Jabari Craig, who verbally committed to play for the Trojans under new coach Andy Enfield on Oct. 10, is getting more recognition as a potential difference-maker in USC’s recruiting class.
North Pole Hoops has Craig ranked fifth in their top-10 list of Canadian players for the class of 2014.
“From a physical standpoint, there are not many prospects in the country (Canada or U.S.) with his attributes, in that Craig, at 6’10” possesses size, big time athleticism, mobility, shot-blocking and glimpses of an offensive skill set,” North Pole Hoops said of Craig. “On the flipside, he is relatively raw, but if he ever turns the corner in his development, Craig is the type that can leave a serious imprint on his college career.”
Before verbally committing to USC, Craig visited Arizona State in September, according to Yahoo! Sports, and was also considering attending Louisville, Ohio State, Marquette, Texas and Old Dominion.
The 6-foot-10, 215-pound center has bounced around North America — he’s from Toronto, Canada, is currently attending Fishburne Military Academy in Waynesboro, Va., and played last season for Tucker High School (Georgia) while averaging 8.5 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.1 blocks.
Craig, who will just be playing his fourth organized season of basketball this upcoming year, is ranked as a three-star recruit by both Rivals and ESPN.
He was invited to Canada’s Junior National Team training camp in an attempt to represent his home country in the 2013 FIBA U19 World Championship. Craig was not selected to the 12-person roster, but did get to play there alongside the consensus No. 1 prospect of the 2013 class, Andrew Wiggins, who will be a freshman at Kansas this season.
Craig currently comprises one-third of the Trojans’ recruiting class for the class of 2014, joining four-star point guard Jordan McLaughlin of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. and four-star power forward Malik Price-Martin of Miami, Fla.

Embarking on arguably its toughest road trip of the season, the USC women’s volleyball team proved victorious against one of its strongest rivals in a match it hopes will be the start of another dominant stretch.
Digging it · Senior libero Natalie Hagglund, an Encinitas, Calif. native, now possesses USC’s all-time dig record after tying and surpassing the record set by Debora Seilhamer late in the pivotal second set. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
And as USC attempted to proved itself as one of the nation’s elite teams, one of its players solidified her standing as one of the program’s best all-time performers.
The No. 4 Women of Troy (19-3, 9-2 Pac-12) turned back Stanford in a thrilling five-set match Wednesday night (16-25, 25-23, 25-18, 22-25, 15-9) to improve to 19-3 on the season and 9-2 in Pac-12 competition. And as the second set neared its conclusion, with USC facing the possibility of a 2-0 deficit, Hagglund took over when her team needed her most.
After the Cardinal went up 23-18 in the second set, the Women of Troy stormed back and won seven consecutive points to take the set 25-23. Hagglund served on the last six points, and also  tied and surpassed the career digs record (2,071) set by Debora Seilhamer by registering her 13th dig of the night to become the school’s all-time leader with 2,072.
The victory was USC’s first at Maples Pavilion since 2006 and marked the school’s first season sweep of the Cardinal since 2003. The loss was also Stanford’s first at home since falling to Michigan on Dec. 3, 2011, and dropped the Cardinal to 15-5 and 8-3 in the Pac-12.
The Women of Troy got off to a slow start in the first set as Stanford jumped out to leads of 8-5 and 12-6. USC failed to put a significant dent in the lead, as they fell behind 20-13 and failed to recover.  The Cardinal ended any hopes of a comeback and took the set 25-16. USC struggled on both sides of the net, hitting just .128 while allowing Stanford to record 17 kills at a .516 clip.
After the thrilling second set tied up the score, the Women of Troy built upon their momentum and pushed ahead 6-2 in the third frame. Stanford came back to within 10-9 on a kill by senior Carly Wopat, but USC rattled off five out of six points to go up 15-10. Stanford pulled to within 20-15, but USC staved off a rally and won it 25-18 when freshman Ebony Nwanebu knocked down her 12th kill. USC overcame its hitting woes to attack at a .486 clip with 20 kills while holding Stanford to .257 with 13 kills.
The Women of Troy continued their uphill climb in the fourth set and built a 15-11 lead before the Cardinal cut it to 16-13. The set remained hotly contested as neither team could string together more than a couple of points. USC went up 20-18, but the Cardinal registered three straight to go ahead 21-20 and pulled away, winning 25-22 to send USC to its second five-set match of the season.
That first five-set contest had been in the friendly confines of the Galen Center — a win in front of the comparatively raucous crowd in Palo Alto would assuredly be a much more difficult task. But just as they had in their first five-set contest, the Women of Troy found an extra gear and emerged victorious.
In an expectedly tight deciding frame, USC went ahead 4-2 to force a timeout from Stanford. The Women of Troy continued to inch ahead, grabbing leads of 6-4 and 8-5 before the Cardinal came up with a key block from Inky Ajanaku and Madison Bugg to close the deficit to a single point at 8-7.
USC regained its composure, staking out an 11-8 lead and forcing another Stanford timeout.
But this time, the stoppage in play seemed to fuel USC — The Women of Troy found enough energy to end any comeback hopes, taking four of the final five points to clinch the set 15-9 and secure their 19th victory of the season.
The triumph was important in both its implications for this season and in its historical significance.
After beating Stanford, the Women of Troy are now only a half-game behind Washington (17-1, 9-1) for first place in the Pac-12.
The victory also marked only the third time in school history that USC has swept its season series with Stanford (2000, 2003).
The Women of Troy will coincidentally face the other team that stretched them to five sets, California (13-6, 6-4), in their next matchup.
USC will have Thursday night off before playing at Berkeley on Friday night to conclude their Northern California trip.

My phone was battered and beaten when I entered the Apple Store two weeks ago. Luckily my phone was insured (thanks, Mom) and the genius at the Genius Bar simply issued me a replacement.
And like that, I had a new phone. Of course, it wasn’t quite that simple. I hadn’t backed up my phone for quite some time, so when I finally updated my information, there were some things that I forgot about and, of that information, some things that I missed … severely.
For everything I missed, however, the one I longed for the most were my emojis. Where did they even come from in the first place? My friend, I think, downloaded them when I was a freshman. But from where? The App Store? The Internet?
Suffice it to say, I’ve been emoji-free since Oct. 16. At first, I hated it. But now, I’m starting to love it. Emojis, for as long as I had my first phone (so, less than two years), served me well. And I’m not the only one.
A friend recently told me that her mom went online to find a spreadsheet of all the emojis and their literal definitions. She keeps it on her Notes app and references it whenever she gets stuck.
And stuck is exactly how I felt on Oct. 18, two days after my successful visit to the Apple Store. How on Earth would I convey emotion to my friends over text? Perhaps worse, how would I ever display agreement without the handy thumbs up emoji? Would I really have to start typing “yeah” (or more likely, “ya”)?
Sarcasm aside, it actually was a bit of a problem.
I wouldn’t call myself a master of the emoji, but I definitely was a frequent — if not addicted — user. Sometimes I would even have full conversations in emoji, as many often do. Most of the time, there was nothing explicitly wrong with doing this. And often, emojis allow for creativity in storytelling (see Aaron Paul’s Twitter during his Jesse Pinkman days).
But, in some cases, emojis became a crutch for me to lean on. I used them to avoid serious conversations or dismiss a weighty situation without fully giving it the consideration it deserved.
My generation is often criticized for texting instead of talking. But emojiying instead of texting seems to be lowering the bar even further. Like texting, emojis leave little in terms of organic reaction from the other side of the communication. And sometimes they only end up muddling a conversation that a simple phone call might have cleared up in the first place.
Cue Girls.
In the first episode of the most recent season, Ray, a brash 33-year-old, confronts Shoshanna, a quirky and endearing 21-year-old, about an emoji-laden text: “A panda next to a gun next to a wrapped gift? It makes no sense.”
Indeed. Not that I necessarily want to be connected with Ray at that point in the storyline, but I’m going to have to agree.
Without having emojis on my phone, I’ve become more creative in my texting. The absence of emojis has required me to, once again, devote more time to something seriously lacking from communication today: deliberation and consideration.
Instead of simply selecting my emotion from a long list of images (for the record, I usually go with the monkey covering its mouth), I’m forced to think about how I feel and express it in words. It’s forced me to attempt cleverness or wit, something often more difficult to do with emojis, at least with the same precision. It’s brought my character back to my communication, rather than relying on the character of a graphically rendered image of a woman with her hand in the air.
Sure, it’s not the same as talking on the phone, but it seems a little bit better than sending an image to speak for itself — and be left up for interpretation.
There are cases when emojis make sense. They are often fun to use to tell stories, show sarcasm or lighten a mood. And once in a while, it’s just fun use them to send that cryptic message. But, at least for now, I’m happy to be using my words again.

Infinite Black Suitcase, the new play by the USC School of Dramatic Arts, aims to show audiences a different portrait of death this Halloween. The production premieres on Halloween at McClintock Theatre and stars many promising USC thespians who test out their comedy chops in a production by acclaimed playwright EM Lewis.
Dramatic bunch · The cast of the student production of Infinite Black Suitcase is looking forward to performing in the McClintock Theater tonight. The performances will run each night through Nov. 3. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Director Robert Bailey told the Daily Trojan that he was introduced to the play by artistic director Jack Rowe, who thought that it would be right up his alley.
“I love to work on plays that are contemporary that deal with contemporary dramatic issues,” Bailey said. “Plays that have naturalistic dialogue and believable human situations.”
The story goes through the experiences of 16 Oregonians living in the same town who all must face death in their own way. The play is structured into 14 vignettes that cut between three story lines and a handful of peripherally related scenes: a widow who has to deal with the suicide of her husband, a gay couple who has to cope with a disease that causes slow deterioration, and the impending death of a mother that threatens to tear apart an unconventional family. Eventually, all of the stories link together and provide an unconventional structure.
“What’s really special about this play is that there’s no protagonist,” actress and theatre major Emma Ward said.
Ward, a senior who has been acting since she was 10, plays Anne, whose husband is to be buried with his ex-wife instead of her. Ward said her favorite part about the play is the humor, and playing a character that does find the humor in the situation.
“She likes to make situations that are very serious as funny as possible,” Ward said.
Theatre and narrative studies major Jaemyeong Lee plays Tony Liu, who has to struggle with his ailing wife Katie. Each actor prepares for a role in a different way, but Lee emphasizes precision in following the script.
“I don’t know if that’s obvious, but reading the play multiple times, you read it once for an overview of how everything fits together. You read it again just to make sure you didn’t miss anything,” Lee said. “You read it again, to try and pick up on different motifs that are showing up and how that targets the overall message of the play. Then you read it again from the perspective of the character.”
Alex Diehl, a senior majoring in theatre, had to make some physical changes in an attempt to  identify with the character.
“I’ve been doing some voice work to lower my voice a little bit and movement work. We also went and visited a graveyard because there’s a scene that takes place in a graveyard,” Diehl said. “It’s actually a very funny play, it’s not a sad play … So a lot of my work has been catching on to the wit of the writing and finding that humor.”
Behind the scenes, humor was prevalent throughout the month-and-a-half rehearsal period. During rehearsal, one actor had to be absent for a couple of weeks, so several people would come and read lines from script, Diehl recalled.
There were other challenges to be overcome by the crew. One included the set, which is described in the script as simple, but with the same spaces representing different locations during different story lines.
“Although the play is written naturalistically, there’s so many scenes, so many different locations. … What we’ve done is we’ve come up with a set that is not exactly naturalistic,” Bailey said. “It’s more suggestive or impressionistic. You might have a scene taking place in the living room of one of the families early on and then that becomes the same scene where a widow, who’s thinking of going to date again. … All we do is make some minor adjustments.”
Bailey and the actors all agreed that the point of the production was to open the eyes of audiences to mortality, but also to teach that humor can still be a part of death.
“It’s something everyone will have to face at some point in their lives. And for a long time … death is something that you think just applies to someone else, until it actually does happen to you,” Lee said. ”And someone that you know is nearing the end of their life. … It gives people ways to cope with that and therefore it also asks us to examine who we are as people.”

After the critical and popular success of 2010’s The Suburbs, which won the Grammy for album of the year in 2011, Arcade Fire has some tough shoes to fill: Its own.
Celebrating in secret · Arcade Fire celebrated the release of its album Reflektor, by performing a “secret gig” Tuesday night at Capitol Records’ Hollywood office. Fans dressed up in honor of the album: One man wore an entire silver sequin suit while another glued pieces of CDs on his clothes. – Photo courtesy of Jean Gagnon
Some critics have called the latest album, Reflektor, a bit frothy — lacking the beautifully melancholic, creatively orchestrated genius of The Suburbs. Still on Tuesday, Reflektor’s official release date, the band — whose members include Win Butler, Régine Chassagne, Richard Reed Parry, William Butler, Jeremy Gara, Tim Kingsbury and Sarah Neufeld — took Capitol Records’ Hollywood office by storm and pulled off a night that was, simply put: fun.
The “secret gig” — with a location kept under wraps until days before the event — was put on by MTV Iggy, MTV’s global music brand, and Intel Corporation, who collaborated with The Music Experiment 2.0. The partnership offered fans the opportunity to win tickets through various media outlets. The Twitter contest, for example, asked fans to tweet what Reflektor means to them in six words.
 
The show focused on songs from the new album, opening with the title hit “Reflektor.”  The song, an upbeat number that incorporated piano solos, rhythmic drums and interesting wordplay has some surprisingly somber lyrics: “I thought I found a way to enter / it’s just a Reflektor.” Arcade Fire is no stranger to penning melancholic lyrics that don’t match the energetic tempo and feel of their songs and this dichotomy existed throughout much of the show and the album as a whole. This set the tone for the night: fun, but thoughtful. Perhaps the band took a cue from album co-producer James Murphy, formerly of the band LCD Soundsytem, whose “Someone Great,” among others, accomplishes a similar feat.
Now for the setting. Upon entering the parking lot next to Capitol Records, the crowd looked 30 feet up or so to find the band playing on an elevated platform, as silver, sparkling streamers cascaded down — reflecting, if you will.
Spirited and energized fans could be seen dancing in outlandish, dazzling outfits. The theme for the night was “be a reflektor” and some really took that to heart. One man wore an entire silver sequined suit with a matching hat and tie. A few audience members took a cue from Pinterest and were spotted wearing outfits with broken up CD bits glued on in a DIY fashion. Others mimicked outfits from Arcade Fire music videos, or dressed in generally sparkly attire.
As for the setlist, the band focused on tracks off the new album in the first half of the night: “Afterlife,” “We Exist” and “Normal Person,” among others. These songs had everyone dancing, as much of Reflektor is riddled with funky rhythms and interesting beats.
Though the show favored the new and less familiar, the band also played fan favorite “Haiti” the first throwback of the night from the band’s first album, Funeral. The excitement of the crowd and sense of nostalgia was infectious.
Also notable was an enthused rendition of “Here Comes the Night Time,” which was followed by an explosion of confetti, sending the crowd into an eruption of cheers and the band into a brief intermission.
Like clockwork, the seven-piece group came back, playing the closing track on Reflektor, “Supersymmetry,” a soft, airy and sweetly sung number. “Sprawl II” followed, a lively, popular hit from The Suburbs, so lively, in fact, that it could have fit right in with the mood and overall vibe of Reflektor.
Butler offered his thank yous, and finally said, “We’ll shut up and play the hits,” surely a reference to James Murphy’s 2012 documentary.
The finale: “Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)” from 2004’s Funeral. The track was a blast from the past; Funeral came out when the band had been together just a few years, and thinking back to the band’s pre-Grammy days incited a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans. It was a total success and the perfect sendoff into the night.
The night was a celebratory one, and from the looks of it, fans and band members alike would not have wanted to debut the new album any other way.
Now it’s time for fans to pore over the album and listen for something new they hadn’t found in the first five to six listens during the two days its been out.
Until next time, Arcade Fire.

Undergraduate Student Government’s commuter senators launched an initiative to reserve parking spots on game days for students with parking permits on Oct. 26.
The initiative began its trial run for the home game against Utah, reserving between 50 and 100 parking spots in Parking Structure 1, the closest university-owned parking facility to the Coliseum.
Spots were available for any students with parking permits, regardless of where their permits are assigned, for up to two hours prior to kickoff. At the two-hour mark, the spots were released and made available for anyone to purchase so that USC Transportation could still earn some revenue.
Some students said they felt pressed for time and limited to only one parking structure, but others were appreciative of the new opportunity.
“I would take advantage because you can’t have everything,” said Fehbe Meza, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. “You have these parking spots reserved. If you want to take advantage of them, go ahead. If not, sorry, but other people do need them.”
Though the initiative has just been launched, USG is optimistic about its impact.
“We got a lot of positive feedback and we’re hoping to expand it,” USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond said. “We hope to do this for every game going forward.”
USG plans to measure the demand from the Utah game and the next home game on Nov. 16 against Stanford to determine the need for commuters driving and adjust accordingly for the UCLA game on Nov. 30 and for future seasons.
“We only have two remaining home games this season,” said Commuter Senator Brett Ressler, a junior majoring in business administration. “But we’re not just looking at this year, we’re looking at the future.”
USG is concerned, however, that students who commute cannot take advantage of the opportunity if they are not aware of it.
“Getting the word out there, that’s the hardest part,” Ressler said. “We really want the commuters to know that the university is looking out for them.”
Another issue the senators have encountered is finding the best way to communicate with the large community of commuter students.
“How do we get this massive number of commuter students together with one voice to figure out what it is that’s the biggest problem for them?” Ressler asked. “We know parking is one.”
Despite these difficulties, the senators said they are determined to inform and help commuters.
“We’re trying to just focus on the needs of our constituents,” USG Commuter Senator Lorin Winata said. “We want to make sure that you’re not at a disadvantage because you are a commuter or don’t have the opportunity to live on campus.”
Many commuters said parking hassles can hamper their college experience.
“As a new student, I want to get involved, but the only way to do that is to actually go to these events,” said commuter Michael Johnson, a third-year transfer student majoring in aerospace engineering. “A huge deterrent to people who are driving an hour to get [to USC] is when they have to spend another 30 minutes looking for parking. But if they have to pay for parking, it’s going to infuriate them even more.”
Other students, however, said they haven’t had any problems finding parking this season.
“Just because it hasn’t been a problem for me, I know that in general it is a problem,” said Anoush Djrbashian, a sophomore majoring in economics. “So just having that option is good because sometimes it is a pain.”
Though football game attendance has been low this season, USG anticipates a larger presence in future seasons and wants to be prepared for students’ needs.
“Front row parking?” Johnson said. “Who wouldn’t take advantage?”

Unless you park in PSD!! PSD is the USC Associate’s Lot on game days (reserved for special alumni folk!). If you have a PSD sticker, you can roll in even 10 minutes after kick-off and still get a spot.

On Wednesday afternoon, USC Spectrum hosted the event The Race Card Project: A Conversation with Michele Norris. The discussion took place in the Rosen Screening Room on the second floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and was moderated by George J. Sanchez, vice dean for diversity in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
All smiles · Radio journalist Michele Norris said she was impressed by students’ openness with the issue of race and identity on Wednesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Norris is a radio journalist and current host of National Public Radio. She created The Race Card Project as an online communityto start conversations about race and identity.
Norris handed out “race cards” at the beginning of her talk so that all those who attended could fill them out with six words about race.
“I’ve been listening to NPR for years and knowing that Michele Norris is here was exciting for me,” said Jenny Di, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development.
When Norris first began the project, she was worried that people would feel uncomfortable talking to her. After sending out a preliminary set of race cards, however, about 30 percent of the cards were returned to her. Within eight months, Norris moved the Race Card Project to social media.
“Diversity was important for a long time because it was about equality, but now sometimes people take diversity for granted since it comes so easily,” Norris said.
At first, many of the cards came back from anonymous writers, but over time, people began to come forward with their stories and experiences and were willing to give their names.
Norris presented points about how people view themselves and others based on race. She said being aware of others’ stories allows people to see them in a different light.
According to The Race Card Project’s website, Norris asked people to think about their experiences, hopes, questions, dreams, laments and observations about race and identity and put their ideas into a sentence with only six words. This sentence would make up their “race cards.” Some of these cards were also accompanied by a story explaining the history behind why people selected their six words.
“There are a lot of new things she brought up for me, specifically about the stories of people who used to be oppressors and asking them to offer their stories,” said Rachel Jones, a junior majoring in political science.
Norris mentioned that a lot of the time, people are uncomfortable talking about race, but she said The Race Card Project helps pull race out of the shadows.
“I was humbled by how much people can pack into just six words,” Norris said.
Many students wrote personal notes for the Race Card Wall.
“I’m a human, not a fruit,” Gabrielle Guzman’s note read.
“Indian with a feather, not a dot,” Courtney Randolph wrote on hers.
Rather than viewing race as “taboo,” Norris attempted to break down that barrier.
“[Norris] talks about the importance of conversation and how we need to do it a lot and meet with people,” Jones said. “We live on a very diverse campus and we should be able to talk to each other.”
The Race Card Project has teamed up with the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin, Madison to encourage people associated with the universities to join in the conversation.
The talk concluded with Norris passing around a booklet containing quotes from various peoples’ six-word “race cards,” and a Q&A session.

Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger met with policy makers on Wednesday as part of an initiative with the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy.
Dean of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, Jack H. Knott, accompanied Schwarzenegger on the Policy in Action trip to three different meetings with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
“This is exactly what Arnold envisioned for the USC institute,” USC Schwarzenegger Institute Global Director Bonnie Reiss said. “This is putting policy into action by meeting with congressional leaders and truly influencing policy decisions.”
Schwarzenegger and Knott met with lawmakers regarding funding for after-school programs. Approximately 8.4 million students in the United States currently participate in the federal government’s after-school program, but a reallocation of funding might take away the federal grants that fund 1.6 million kids.
The Policy in Action trip was planned after Schwarzenegger wanted to explain the reasons these after-school programs are essential.
“My goal is to keep the funding for the after-school program by the federal government and not have that money diverted into other areas of education,” Knott said. “A lot of the research coming out of universities shows that after-school programs are very important for academic achievement and keeping students out of crime. So, as a school we are very supportive of these programs and making sure funding is sustained.”
The Schwarzenegger Institute also stressed that another achievement of these meetings is bipartisan cooperation.
“Especially in light of the government shutdown, the fact that Democrats and Republicans are working together because of our invitation is important,” Reiss said. “This is the other great accomplishment that we are doing.”
Participants in the day’s meetings included senators Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) as well as representatives Karen Bass (D-Ca;if.), Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Tom Petri (R-Wis.), Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) and Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).
Reiss joined Schwarzenegger and Knott on the Policy in Action trip, and Executive Director of the Afterschool Alliance Jodi Grant and CEO of After-School All-Stars Ben Paul also participated.
After-School All-Stars, one of the country’s leading after-school programs, was founded in 1992 by Schwarzenegger. The program now serves more than 400 schools in 15 major cities. Activities run from Monday through Friday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., and allows students to be supervised during peak crime hours.
Many USC students were supportive of after-school programs.
“These programs are a good thing to keep,” said Michelle Ngan, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “It keeps kids entertained and is good for parents who can’t take care of their kids right after school. Especially because a lot of after-school activities can be very expensive.”
Ngan added that though she never attended the programs, many of her friends did.
ASAS provides enrichment, academic and health and fitness programs. In the Los Angeles area, the program serves 37 schools and 22,536 students.
“This is an important issue that affects Los Angeles and also the country,” Knott said. “Especially for the younger students coming into our education system. They need this type of support and it would help the future of our economy.”
After their three meetings Wednesday, Schwarzenegger and Knott visited the After-School All-Stars program at Stuart Hobson Middle School in Washington, D.C.

Wednesday’s “Students Talk Back” forum, hosted by the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy and Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, discussed U.S. immigration policies and the prospects of immigration reform passing the federal legislature.
Objectivity · Jon Wilcox, president of Multiplicity Media, gives an unbiased perspective on the controversial topic of immigration reform Wednesday afternoon at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The event included guest panelists Amy Gebert, Jon Wilcox, Christian Patterson and Teddy Davis. Gebert and Patterson, both student workers at the Unruh Institute, have previously held internships at the Sacramento Bee and at the Office of Gov. Jerry Brown. Wilcox, president of Multiplicity Media and a former Daily Trojan editor, and Davis, who was the press secretary for former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, balanced  each other on the panel. Davis focused on politics, and Wilcox was more interested in an objective diagnosis of the situation.
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Daily Trojan online editor Jordyn Holman co-moderated the event.
The debate began with a discussion of the Republican Party’s stance on immigration reform and its resolution to improve race relations in the wake of the 2012 elections. Patterson opened the discussion with his opinions on the House’s attempts at immigration reform.
“I think I’m a little bit more negative on that question,” Patterson said. “The Senate passed a very large bill that included a path to citizenship and more money for border security. It looks like the House is going to pass a bill that large. It seems difficult for Speaker John Boehner to get the majority of the Republicans to vote on a bill that large.”
Wilcox agreed with Patterson’s analysis that immigration reform is unlikely to surface anytime soon.
“I share [Patterson’s] gloominess,” Wilcox said. “The reason why I think this will fail in the circumstances because it is a deep, complex, emotional policy but it’s completely wrapped up in the politics.”
Wilcox also said he believes the only path to comprehensive reform is through a democratic majority.
“Realistically, the only way these things can pass is the way Obamacare passed … a non-bipartisan effort,” he said.
He said this is because the Republican majority wants minor reforms, with increased visas and more agricultural workers. Davis argued that if a Democratic majority accepts any of these minor reforms, it can compromise comprehensive reform.
“The Democrats know that the holy grail is a pathway to citizenship,” Davis said.
Davis believes that unless the Democrats strive for this “holy grail,” no real reform will pass.
In addition, the panelists stressed that state legislation is critical to passing immigration reform. Gebert cited the Trust Act, a California act that limits the sate government’s cooperation with federal immigration authorites, and new legislation that allows non-citizens to practice law.  But Wilcox stated that though more liberal states will emulate California, more conservative states will emulate Arizona’s stricter sanctions.
Gebert argued against this point, saying that state legislation is a way to start a conversation about immigration reform in the federal government when controversial bills go to the Supreme Court.
Though the panelists disagreed on  multiple issues, the topic of the president’s involvement in immigration reform was the most polarizing. Davis was in favor of his involvement, but the student panelists argued that Obama’s influence is limited to the Democratic Party, which already supports reform.
Thomas Armstrong, a junior majoring in history and international relations, spoke of USC’s place in the immigration debate.
“I think as a university in Los Angeles with incredible racial diversity and a growing Hispanic community … We are at the center of a potential nationwide movement,” Armstrong said. “I think the duty [of a USC student] is to be informed.”
After the event, Patterson said  that the issue called for more civic participation in communities.
“I think that getting engaged and putting your voice out there for issues you believe in is part of what this country is all about,” Patterson said. “And USC students should definitely make their voices heard and organize and reach out to their elected officials.”
Next week’s forum will discuss the George W. Bush and Obama administrations’ challenges in the Middle East.

As victims gathered on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, the still-decimated neighborhoods where many lost family, friends and homes served as stark reminders of the work still left remaining in the relief effort.
In the midst of so much destruction, leaders at the local, state and national levels came together to demonstrate that some crises are above politics. Sometimes, cases of human pain and suffering demand that we abandon our political agendas and work together for the common good. It is a shame that such instances have become the exception these days — though certainly not a shame that we don’t get hit by more hurricanes — but remembering the cooperation and selflessness that defined the post-Sandy recovery can prevent history from repeating itself -— at least as frequently as it does now.
This effort begins by recognizing that all policies have human implications. Though the human implication of the Sandy aid package was painfully obvious, that is not so with most other policies our government examines. Budget negotiations, immigration reform and even legalization of marijuana have a powerful impact on someone, somewhere. American policies are not pieces on a chessboard, and recognizing the human factor in policymaking can help others realize that.
Seventy-nine days after the superstorm, Congressional delays were overcome and the House of Representatives voted 241 to 180 to pass a $50 billion aid bill that would give federal relief to the victims of the hurricane. Though the delay was significant, the measure remains one of the most significant policy achievements of 2013. In bipartisan fashion, Congress abandoned its split ideology and passed the measure: There was no filibuster, no Hastert rule and no attempt to repeal Obamacare along the way.
The day after Sandy, President Barack Obama and Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) talked over the phone in what was to become the first of a daily briefing on the Sandy situation over the next 10 days. Despite criticism from Congressional Republicans who were concerned the bipartisanship effort was too close to Election Day, Christie toured the state with Obama in a show of solidarity and party unity.
“That was at least four or five times I called him and said, ‘I hate to bother you with this, sir, but you told me if I needed help to call you, and Federal Emergency Management Agency is driving me crazy or the Army is driving me crazy and I don’t understand this and can you help me?” Christie said. “And each and every time that I did that, within an hour the problem was fixed.”
The unification that took place between Obama and Christie during those 10 days in October is deeply emblematic of the future of politics in America: As the GOP careens farther and farther right, Obama will be challenged to pick members of the GOP he can actually work with. Rumored presidential candidate in 2016, Christie strikes many as the new face of the GOP. And he should be.
Last week, New Jersey officially recognized gay marriage, becoming the 14th state to do so. After opposing several measures to recognize gay marriage, Christie announced his support after a decision by the New Jersey State Supreme Court decided a case that allowed them to go forward. Christie’s foresight on the question is notable, as the large majority of the GOP still stands in staunch opposition to gay marriage.
In many ways, the anniversary of Sandy is a reminder that there are reasonable politicians left in America. He might not be perfect, but Christie is a Republican who most democrats outside of New Jersey should be afraid of. He’s managed the almost impossible feat of being elected governor of a heavily Democratic state, and is expected to win in a landslide when he faces re-election next Tuesday. If the Republican Party has any sense, Christie will be their man for 2016. Ted Cruz will rant and rave, but Christie seems like the candidate who won’t back down easily. And if Christie can withstand the inevitable push to the right that primary season causes, the Republican ticket will be one to watch out for.

Last week, actress Julianne Hough caused a media firestorm when she attended a Halloween party dressed as the character Crazy Eyes from the Netflix show Orange is the New Black.  The only problem? She was in blackface.
Unfortunately, Hough’s costume was just one small instance in a recent explosion of some frustrating conversations surrounding the merits of blackface. Besides Hough, photos of Caucasians as Trayvon Martin and white football coaches as the cast of Cool Runnings, all in blackface, have made the rounds.
And though writers, scholars, activists and everyone in between have tried, an important message seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle: Blackface is always racist.
“Why?” Well, there are copious reasons. Let’s try to briefly explain them:
“Racism doesn’t exist anymore!”
Yes, slavery legally ended more than a century ago. Sadly, no matter how progressively Americans would like to view the United States, the effects of slavery still linger in society today. For every African-American in the White House, there’s one who can’t walk home from the store without the fear of getting killed. Racism exists and there’s no denying it. Is the situation better than it was 100 years ago? Of course. Yet it bears mentioning that the Civil Rights Movement only happened around 50 years ago. With each generation, racism shrinks little by little, but to say that it isn’t still an issue is simply ignorant.
“What about reverse racism?”
Reverse racism was a term created to help those who were oppressors cope with the feeling of losing dominance. In fact, using the claim that something is “reverse racism” is pretty racist itself.
Now some Caucasians are upset over the fact that they’re not supposed to say the n-word though African-Americans can. When said in context in the black community, the word means something very similar to “Hey bro!” When a Caucasian person says that word to or about a black person, however, it will always carry a negative connotation. Back in the day, when a Caucasian called a black person the n-word, it did not mean “Sup bro.” Instead it meant, “Hey you less-than-a-human-being-who’s-absolutely-nothing, do this.”
To say that something is reversely racist would be declaring that Caucasians and African-Americans have suffered throughout history on an equal level. Apparently, affirmative action is just as unfair as legal ownership of another person. But as Stanley Fish stated in an article for the Atlantic, “… blacks have not simply been treated unfairly; they have been subjected first to decades of slavery, and then to decades of second-class citizenship, widespread legalized discrimination, economic persecution, educational deprivation, and cultural stigmatization.”
Let’s be frank: The word “unfair” doesn’t even begin to cover it.
“So what does this have to do with blackface?”
Blackface itself has its own lengthy history, but here’s the gist: When people say blackface, it doesn’t just refer to the act of painting one’s face black. In the 19th century, some white actors began to perform skits as black characters, painting their faces dark with red lips. The skits would center around racist stereotypes, filled with gags about blacks acting dumb, loud, obnoxious and the like.
But slavery is not funny. Segregation? Not exactly a knee-slapper. Yet these performances depicted these acts as amusing, and “desensitized Americans to the horrors of chattel slavery,” according to Grio. Instead of cringing in horror over the situation, people laughed. So blackface isn’t just about trying to look black. When someone paints their face black, they’re mocking a culture — whether intentionally or not.
“How can I dress up as someone black and not be racist?”
Just because blackface is racist doesn’t mean you can’t have fun on Halloween. In lieu of painting your face black, try using other means of identifying yourself as the person you’re trying to emulate. Hough could have been easily recognized as Crazy Eyes without the darkening — the hair in knots and prison jumpsuit was obvious enough.
A person of any race could feasibly dress up as Madonna with a cone bra or wedding dress and well-placed mole, or Abraham Lincoln with a tall hat and fake beard — white face paint not needed.
Admittedly, this only skims the surface of the problem. There are far more detailed explanations that dive into the history and moral implications of the issue. But the moral of the story is blackface can be extremely hurtful to a large segment of the population. Rather than saying African Americans need to stop complaining and acting like victims, take a second and think about why they might feel hurt. Contrary to some beliefs, objecting to the idea of blackface doesn’t mean that someone doesn’t have a “sense of humor” or is “too sensitive.” It means that after centuries of subjugation, seeing a physical reminder of a dark period in the nation’s history is the last thing that anyone wants.
And it’s not just blackface. Those who dress as Native Americans or geishas run the risk of offending people as well. It doesn’t matter if the intent is sincerely positive: There is a blurred line between honoring a person or culture and mocking it.
Hopefully, the next time someone decides to paint their face black, they’ll realize what it actually means.
Blackface is racist. End of story.

Just because someone is white doesn’t mean they are an “oppressor”. My ancestors were all white immigrants who came to this country from Europe nearly 50 years after slavery ended. They also all lived in northern and western cities so don’t try to blame them for Jim Crow either. 
The majority of whites in America today are descended from people who never so much as lived within a thousand miles of a slave plantation, let alone owned slaves themselves.
To put a broad, blanket blame for slavery on “white people” is to hold a negative stereotype of an entire race based on the actions of a tiny minority of people who happen to be of that race. That is the textbook definition of racism.
Ironic.
^ This so much. In one of my freshman poli sci classes this kid tried to tell me that “you need to accept responsibility for what whites did to blacks in American history”. He was using the plural “you”, as in “you white people” as if we’re all the same. That’s so ignorant and offensive. My parents moved to LA from Armenia in the 1980’s. I had absolutely nothing to do with slavery and neither did they. Don’t you dare try to lump me in with a bunch of rich slaveowners in the 1800’s Southern U.S. just because they had roughly the same shade of skin pigmentation as me. They weren’t even ethnically from the same part of Europe for gods sake.
Slavery was an abomination and like any decent American I look at that era with disgust, but if you think I’m gonna feel any personal guilt for it you’re out of your mind.
I know many Korean families who own markets in South LA who have been robbed at gun point by black thugs. In addition to robbery – where these Asian also victims of racism because the thugs were black and the victim was Asian? It is always funny to hear the Oprah’s , Obama’s, Shaprton’s complain how racist a society the US is – when they have achieved a level of success unmatched in probably any other corner of the world…
It is so refreshing to use Halloween as another opportunity to play a victim of racism again. I guess in a few more weeks we will also hear about the oppressive discussions about Christmas monopolizing the holidays instead of Kwanza… Remember everyone – whoever can cry victim loudest wins!
“For every African-American in the White House, there’s one who can’t walk home from the store without the fear of getting killed.”  What a ridiculous observation.
Believing you are a victim of racism or someone else is racist requires you to believe that the offending party has authority or power over you. I simply see it as dumb or silly.
^Agree with MJ here. This article tells me NOTHING about something that just happened in the media, instead preferring an over-simplified summary of common responses to the problem of racism. I especially take issue with the “reverse racism” “explanation”… Does these mean that we have to assume ALL caucasians feel to blame for historical injustice? Does this somehow entitle them to discriminate against caucasians in return? Against Hispanics? Against Asians? or any other group?
In summary, this article hardly seems worthy of the sort of intellectual discussion befitting a college campus. And by that, I mean, “An actress did this, which was reprehensible, but anyone who disagrees with me is ignorant and implicated in centuries of historiacl racism.”
Thanks for this article, Sheridan. It’s sad that this needed to be said, but ignorance abounds on this campus and I hope your piece helped deter any plans to use blackface this Halloween at USC. One additional comment: “Reverse racism” is a problematic term for an even simpler reason: it implies that the “normal” form of racism is that of Caucasians against African Americans. This is ahistorical and just linguistically unfounded. It also perpetuates the idea that that power relation is somehow natural, and that the “reverse” is a perversion. Racism is prejudice, and blackface is one grotesque example. The idea that Halloween without it wouldn’t be “fun” is terrifying. Who’s having fun here? To the commenter who declared this article “over sensitive” and said Hough wasn’t wearing blackface–maybe you need a history lesson, and/or an eye exam. You don’t have the right to mock and exploit a group of people. That’s what some like to call progress.
This is bullshit and over sensitive. I wouldn’t even start to classify Hough’s makeup as being blackface. It is not mockery, it is a costume of a very respected character.
You obviously don’t know the history behind blackface. Just because her makeup was brown does not mean that she didn’t make the deliberate decision to darken her skin. Everything about her costume said “Crazy Eyes.” Why did she feel the need to resort to a historically offensive trope to put it together? It was unnecessary, insensitive and racist. Period. “Very respected character?” Blackface is the definition of disrespect. 
Maybe you should do your research on blackface before you dismiss opinions as being “over sensitive.”
