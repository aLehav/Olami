Several competitions for the 2015 Special Olympics World Games will be held at USC facilities when Los Angeles hosts the games from July 25 to Aug. 2 for the first time since 1984.
Among the venues included as part of the games are the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies this summer, the Galen Center, Cromwell Field and the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
In addition to USC, several venues throughout the county will be used, including facilities in Long Beach, Downtown, Griffith Park, Encino and UCLA.
Established in the 1960s by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of former President John F. Kennedy, the Special Olympics is the largest organization for athletes with intellectual disabilities. The organization began as a day camp at Shriver’s Maryland home. Since then, the competition has grown to include participants from more than 170 countries. The games alternate between summer and winter seasons and are held every two years. The 2015 games will be the first summer games hosted by a U.S. city since 1999. Recent hosts include Athens, Shanghai and Dublin.
Steven Vanderpool, senior vice president of communications and media operations for the Los Angeles 2015 Special Olympics, predicted a turnout of 7,000 athletes and 3,000 coaches at the 2015 games, and a half-million spectators are expected to attend. According to Vanderpool, however, that is a conservative estimate considering the promotion of the event has yet to reach its height.
“We have fantastic partners in terms of donating ad space on billboards, bus stations, TV and radio, “ Vanderpool said. “AMC Theatres is running a World Games trailer. Toyota is doing a number of events to bring awareness. Coca-Cola, who is no stranger to large sporting events, has actually been a partner of Special Olympics since day one.”
Vanderpool also commended his organizing partners at USC.
“Our main contact has been Dr. Carol Dougherty, who used to work with the athletic department. There are also a number of other departments that we work with. It’s been great,” Vanderpool said. “USC hosted the summer invitational this last year, [where] we ran a successful test event.”
Both USC and UCLA will host athlete villages; two-thirds of the athletes and coaches are staying at USC and another third will stay at UCLA.
Vanderpool said that performances for the opening and closing ceremonies are still yet to be confirmed. He did confirm, however, that Five Currents, a production firm based in Redondo Beach, would design the ceremonies. The company’s past projects include the London Olympics and Sochi Olympics.
Meghan Stephens, president of USC Best Buddies, said that the campus organization is promoting its members to independently volunteer for the event.
“Best Buddies supports the Special Olympics and works with [them] on many events including the Spread the Word to End the Word campaign [a campaign that is geared toward stopping the use of the word “retarded”],” Stephens said. “Because the event begins in July, the USC chapter is not participating as a whole because most members will not be at USC during summer vacation. However, we encourage all members [staying on campus] to volunteer and be involved in both the planning and execution of the Special Olympics.”
[Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that Dr. Carol Dougherty currently works with the Athletic Department at USC. She no longer works there now. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted its weekly Students Talk Back event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday afternoon. Students and panelists at the event discussed the domestic and foreign policy of President Barack Obama’s second term in office.
The discussion, entitled “Obama’s Second Term: Stronger at Home, Troubled Abroad,” focused on the president’s political trends since when he was first elected.
The panel featured Bob Shrum, a political consultant and the USC Dornsife Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics, and Michael Davidson, the CEO of Gen Next, a nonprofit organization that encourages success by expanding educational, economical and global security opportunities.
Co-moderators included Dan Schnur, director of Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Nick Thomas, a member of the USC College Republicans.
Schnur fostered discussion among the panelists and audience members about Obama’s trends in foreign policy and his use of executive power to push through his policies.
“Now, Republicans have so much control over the House and the Senate,” Davidson said. “But I … think the center of gravity and the seat of power is still with the president.”
Shrum felt that the issue of whether Obama is overstepping his authority through executive order is more of a partisan one.
“Whether the president has too much power or not depends on if the president is in your party or not,” Shrum said. “The Republican effort to defunct the president’s efforts was always doomed to fail, and this leads to counterproductive effects for the Republicans, such as sanctions for Iran.”
According to Davidson, the American people don’t know what they want because of the massive flow of information from the media and distress within the government. He said this leads to an elected leader who doesn’t know how to lead.
“I would like the country to participate in a rigorous debate on the issue,” Davidson said. “The American people need to be more engaged in these topics, but if they’re going to be run on executive orders, then the American people won’t see it.”
Davidson said that as a panelist at the event, he wanted to get more people to think about these issues and to attract others to be a part of it.
“USC has a Dan [Schnur] for a reason,” Davidson said. “There are few people in the world that care so much about getting students and young people in leadership positions, and this is just one of the many examples of what Dan does to make that happen, so it was an honor to just be a small part of it.”
Schnur hopes to show students that disagreement is not necessarily a bad thing because it fosters conversation about the issues. Schnur said that the purpose of the panels is to bring people from different perspectives together for a discussion, not a fight. He said that he attempts to portray a model of discussion in which the participants respect each other’s intelligence, while acknowledging that they may come to different, but equally valid, conclusions.
John Vitzileos, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business, enjoyed the conversational aspect of the event.
“There were probably 20 or 30 people here total, so getting to talk to them upfront, up close and getting their opinions on certain issues is something that you couldn’t get in big lecture, where they’re a little bit concerned with the things that would get recorded and put out there,” Vitzileos said.

USC hosted a discussion with the founder of FratMANers: Fraternity Men Against Negative Environments and Rape Situations  in Hoffman Hall last nigh to discuss ways to combat campus rape culture. Four members of FratMANers, an organization at San Diego State University, led a discussion about the increasingly common rape culture on college campuses in the United States.
FratMANers partnered with I Am That Girl: USC, a nonprofit organization started by a USC alumna that attempts to create a support system to empower women, to open up a conversation with USC students about sexual assault, especially in the Greek community, through reading rape statistics, bringing to light myths about rape and sexual assault, addressing gray areas and leading interactive discussions.
Sean Guardian, former President of FratMANers and graduate of SDSU, talked about why it is important for men to join the conversation.
“As a fraternity member, at least, where we are stereotyped … we are statistically the group of people that live in a place where most of that sexual assault happens, and especially in a Greek community that our university kind of prides itself on, it makes sense that it should be something we’re at the front of,” Guardian said.
Guardian continued by explaining that members of the FratMANers all have close female friends they feel obligated to protect from sexual assault.
“All of us have girls close with us on a personal level. Like I said earlier, I wouldn’t want one of my good friends to be sexually assaulted, and if I can put people in a position to stop that, guys and girls, then I feel that is an obligation I have,” Guardian continued.
Samantha Goldberg, president of the I Am That Girl: USC chapter, and Jojo Korsh, vice president, introduced the representatives of FratMANers who started the presentation by explaining why the relatively new SDSU organization is important to them.
Guardian first talked about how and why he got involved in the organization.
“I got involved with this just because it seemed like a cool opportunity,” Guardian said. “A lot of us have girl friends that we go to school with; sisters, mothers, whoever it may be, and it is a big issue,” Guardian said. “It is something that is very prevalent, especially within the Greek community but across all college campuses or any setting that you’ll ever put yourself in. It’s just important to be actually engaged in keeping my friends safe.”
Another one of the representatives mentioned that he joined the program after thinking of his little sister, and he knows that he would expect the university of her choice to have a program like FratMANers in place to educate students in her college community.
The presentation continued with icebreakers that encouraged students to feel more comfortable talking about sexual assault.
The first activity involved students walking to the front of the room and declaring whether they agree, disagree or feel neutral toward incorrect, yet commonly accepted myths. Some of the statements included, “Everyone is a potential rapist,” “if women were clear about their sexual limits, men would not be so confused and forced sex would decrease,” and “overweight or unattractive women are less likely to be raped.”
The next activity involved students closing their eyes and imagining a typical social scene. Then, on a white board, students shouted out characteristics that they would attribute to the males and females in that environment. One of the representatives changed the word “males” to “rapists” and the word “females” to “victims.” During this activity, there was a more serious tone. The activity continued with statistics about rape on college campuses in the United States.
During the last activity, students received slips of paper with scenarios in which it is questionable whether or not to engage in sexual activity.
Other topics brought up during the presentation included victim blaming, partner abuse, regret sex and resources for victims.
Korsh described her feelings about the way rape is handled at USC.
“Overall, the way we deal with rape is really not the way we should… I think that people in this school become idolized, and then the community as a whole doesn’t want to put blame on those people and people are afraid to put blame on them [sic] for their actions,” Korsh said. “I think the school also has an incredible responsibility to report everything, and nothing should ever be under-reported.”

The No. 3 USC women’s tennis team were upset by their crosstown rivals in the UCLA Bruins in Westwood on Wednesday .
In a match that lasted almost five hours, the Bruins defeated USC 4-3, to drop them to 10-2 overall on the season.
The Women of Troy had gathered a great deal of momentum going into their clash against the Bruins, riding a six-game winning streak and not having lost since early February at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
Things started off on a positive note in doubles for the Women of Troy, as the all-freshman pair of Gabby Smith and Madison Westby put away UCLA’s Terri Fleming and Kristin Wiley by a score of 8-4.
Unfortunately, junior Giuliana Olmos and senior Zoë Scandalis fell 3-8 to UCLA’s Catherine Harrison and Kyle McPhillips, the second-ranked duo in the country.
Sophomore Zoë Katz and senior Sabrina Santamaria dropped a tough 7-8 loss to Robin Anderson and Chanelle Van Nguyen and conceded the doubles point to the Bruins.
Doubles have been a slight struggle in an overall phenomenal season so far for the Women of Troy, and head coach Richard Gallien stressed that it was an area where the team must improve.
“We haven’t played great doubles, 1-2-3, for a while, so we put ourselves in bit of a hole by losing,” he said. “It’s easy to say that you’re just going to win the doubles, but had we won them today, we would have won the match.”
Santamaria rebounded immediately from the disappointing doubles defeat and swept past McPhillips in singles, 6-2, 6-0, to knot the score at one apiece, but Olmos could not pull off the upset against the third-ranked Anderson, falling in straight sets, 4-6, 4-6. Then Kaitlin Ray’s 5-7, 2-6 win over USC’s Smith put the Women of Troy on the brink of defeat with the score at 3-1, UCLA.
But USC was not about to go quietly. Westby battled to a 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Harrison to make the Bruins sweat, and freshman Meredith Xepoleas soon finished off Fleming, 6-2, 7-6, to complete a stunning comeback.
All eyes then shifted to the deciding match between experienced seniors in Scandalis and Van Nguyen, which was entering its third set.
Scandalis had dropped the first, 2-6, before taking the next, 6-3. Van Nguyen raced out to a 2-5 lead in the deciding set and looked set to finish USC off, but Scandalis dug in and pulled off the day’s second Houdini act, managing to tie the final set at five each.
A miraculous victory was sadly not on the cards, however, and Scandalis eventually fell, 2-6, 6-3, 6-7, sending the Women of Troy home with a loss.
Though the end result was disappointing, Gallien praised the team’s spirit after the players found themselves in a deep hole in the early going.
“This is a team that really fights well with great character,” he said. “[The loss] is painful today, but we have a lot more tennis to play.”
Next up, the team returns home next Wednesday after three consecutive road games to face San Diego State.
USC now looks to start another winning streak, and the players await their chance at payback on April 16, when UCLA visits Marks Stadium.
“Hopefully we give [San Diego State] a good kicking and just get back on track,” Gallien said. “I don’t see this group hanging their heads for too long.”
This is Gallien’s 20th season at Troy. He has reached the final four twice. Think it is time to find new leadership which
could make this program a lot more successful mirroring the men team who has won 5 national titles in the last 6 years.

I knew that 2015 was going to be a magical year for USC baseball once it was announced that former Trojan great Randy Johnson would be inducted into this year’s class of the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.
In early January, the “Big Unit” became the third USC player to be elected to receive the honor with a voting percentage of just over 97 percent, joining former Trojans pitcher Tom Seaver and current Philadelphia Phillies president Pat Gillick.
The five-time Cy Young award winner and former Daily Trojan staffer’s highly regarded distinction undoubtedly brings back memories of the program’s dominance over three decades under legendary head coach Rod Dedeaux.
Interestingly enough, the announcement of Johnson’s induction came just a day after the anniversary of Dedeaux’s passing in 2006.
If you look back at the timing of Johnson’s career at USC and connect the dots, it’s actually really fascinating to see all of the superstars that the program had produced in the Dedeaux’s final years as coach.
The 1983-1984 Trojans team not only featured the 6-foot-10 Johnson, but also performance-enhancing drug user and slugger Mark McGwire, who was later drafted that year 10th overall by the Oakland Athletics.
Another USC icon on that team was the 1985 Rose Bowl co-MVP and linebacker Jack del Rio. The newly hired coach of the Oakland Raiders actually caught Johnson’s pitches behind the place as a catcher in his days with the program.
Finally, former USC quarterback and 1988 Heisman Trophy    runner-up Rodney Peete also played third baseman for the Trojans. Peete was still on the team when Dedeaux announced his retirement in 1986, which marked the end of an era for the program after the “Houdini of Bovard” served for 45 seasons.
Dedeaux was the glue that held the USC baseball program together for so many years. Now, two decades later, manager Dan Hubbs, in his third year, is trying to put back together the pieces of a program that has an incredibly rich history and tradition of dominance.
Up until a couple days ago, the Trojans stood undefeated before dropping its first game of the season to UC Santa Barbara.
It’s too bad the No. 25 – ranked Trojans couldn’t pull this one-run game out, as they are in store for their toughest weekend yet at the Dodger Stadium, where the team will face a trio of the nation’s      top-ranked teams including No. 1 Vanderbilt, No. 6 UCLA and No. 7 TCU.
Nonetheless, the stage will be set for USC this weekend and it will culminate in a game against its crosstown rivals at Dodgers Stadium on Sunday.
It’s also their golden opportunity to show the rest of Division I baseball that this Trojans team is for real and not another Dan Hubbs-coached group that has a strong start, but then slides off as the season goes on.
After starting out the year 12-0, the program is off to its best start since 1988, though we’ve seen this before from the Trojans.
In the 2013-2014 season, the team got off to a hot 7-0 start before going on to lose six of its next seven games and finish the season just five games over .500. Though this is not the ultimate goal of a program that has won more NCAA titles than any other school (12), it was a big step, as it was the first time they finished a season with more wins than losses since 2005. The year not only marked the last time the Trojans made it to the postseason, but also former skipper Mike Gillespie’s final season at the helm.
After narrowly missing the NCAA Tournament last season, this team is already well on its way to redeeming itself, though we might have said that about the 2013-2014 team that also got off to a triumphant start.
I think this year’s team is different, though, from those of the past. Yes, the Trojans have for the most part, pounded on what are dubbed as “Mickey-Mouse” teams, but that should not affect the team’s legitimacy.
They’ve already taken down a top-25 ranked team in Cal State Fullerton and their only loss came at the hands of the Gauchos, who are currently ranked the No. 24 team in the country.
We see college football and basketball programs fly out inferior teams every year just so they can start the season on a high note and gain some confidence early on. This tradition really isn’t much different in collegiate baseball.
By beating up on teams like Towson and Fordham, the team has created a sense of excitement around the program that will be necessary as it enters the more durable part of its schedule including Pac-12 play, which is always a grind.
Most importantly, USC has shown its ability to win close games largely due to some strong late-inning pitching and clutch hitting — the team already pulled out six out of its seven decisions that have been decided by two runs or less.
I’m already a believer in this year’s Trojans team, and if they can take two out of three in this weekend’s highly anticipated set against some of college baseball’s finest, it would justify my preconceived notions that USC can get back to the postseason.
Darian Nourian is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Persian Persuasion,” runs Thursdays.
Let’s wait until after this weekend to see how magical the season will become. A long way to go before making the tournament
for the first time since 2005. Offense needs to get better for sure.

After a tough weekend in Washington, the USC women’s basketball team heads back to Seattle for the Pac-12 Tournament. In their first round game, they will face the No. 9 seed Colorado Buffaloes (13-16, 6-12 Pac-12). The Women of Troy conquered the Buffs twice during the season.
“We’ve been relentless all year long,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “One thing we need to do is start to put together a 40-minute game.”
The Buffs defeated Arizona (10-19, 3-15 Pac-12) last Friday, but fell to Arizona State (26-4, 15-3 Pac-12) in their last regular season game. Jamee Swan averages 13.2 points and 7.9 rebounds per game, while Jen Reese earns 13 points and 7.1 rebounds per game. Both players shoot at 47 percent in field goals.
The Buffs and the Women of Troy last matched brawn in the Galen Center on Feb. 8. Four Trojans, including freshman forward Kristen Simon and redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams, scored in the double digits.
“We know some of their tendencies and we know their player personnel, but I think we’re using that to our advantage,” senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama said.
USC might be forced to go into Key Arena without the services of Vaioletama, however, who as of Tuesday has not been cleared to play after suffering a concussion. Simon will return in time for tournament play.
“We’re used to making do,” Cooper-Dyke said. “This an opportunity for Simon to step up or [Amy] Okonkwo to step up or Jordan to give us minutes and defense.”
Cooper-Dyke has been focusing on ironing out the details of the Women of Troy’s gameplan and working hard to prepare the newer players for the intensity of the tournament.  The Women of Troy won the conference tournament last year.
“Last year, the biggest thing we did is we all came together at the end,” sophomore guard Courtney Jaco said. “We’re the only ones that believed we could do it.”
The last seven days have been triumphant and tragic for the Women of Troy. Three of the Women of Troy finish the season with Pac-12 honors. Vaioletama was chosen to be a member of All-Pac-12 Team. Vaioletama has averaged 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, and was named the SMU Thanksgiving Classic MVP during this season. She has hit her career high of 24 points twice and scored double digits 16 games.
“To be a part of that is a blessing and an honor and I’m humbled,” Vaioletama said.
Senior forward Kaneisha Horn earned All Pac-12 Defensive Honorable Mention after averaging 10.3 points and 6.9 rebounds per game. Horn earned her first double-double this season and has scored in the double digits in 18 games. When the Women of Troy fought against Sacramento State, Horn earned a career high in scoring and a double-double with 20 points and 15 rebounds.
Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert received a spot on the Pac-12 All Freshmen team. The conference honored Calvert by voting her Pac-12 Freshmen of the Week in January.  She is the second leading 3-point shooter for the Women of Troy, executing a total of 36 shots from behind the arc during the season. Calvert ties with Horn, having 10.3 points per game; both are tied as USC’s second leading scorers.
Unfortunately, the Women of Troy went 0-2 over the weekend; the fight against the Washington Huskies (22-8, 11-7 Pac-12) and Washington State Cougars (16-13, 7-11, Pac-12) would leave them with 15-14 overall and 7-11 in the Pac-12 Conference. The Women of Troy had to fight on without Vaioletama and Simon.
In the game Saturday against the Cougars, Calvert led in scoring with 18 points and Horn contributed 14 points.
“Some of the challenge is a mental challenge,” Cooper-Dyke said. “They know us, we know them and the team with the strongest will, intensity and focus will win the game.”

The USC men’s basketball team dropped their last game of the season to crosstown rivals UCLA 85-74.
Riding momentum from their win over Washington, the Trojans (11-19, 3-15) came out aggressive, jumping to an early 12-9 lead. However, behind the hot shooting of guard Bryce Alford and forward Tony Parker, the Bruins (19-12, 11-7) responded with an 18-5 run of their own.
“We played well enough to win, but we did not rebound well enough to win,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
A pair of 3-pointers from guard Katin Reinhardt, followed by a Darion Clark layup capped off a 12-2 Trojan run and cut the Bruins’ lead to single digits. Alford would drain a three to end the half, giving the Bruins a       46-35 lead.
Both Parker and Alford had their way with the Trojan defense in the first half, combining for 28 of UCLA’s 46 points.
“He [Alford] is a terrific player,” Enfield said. “Give him credit, he made shots.”
As a team, UCLA was extremely efficient, shooting 53 percent from the field and 45 percent from deep.
Strangely enough, the Trojans outshot and out rebounded       (15-14) the Bruins in the first half but found themselves behind by double digits due to turning the ball over nine times compared to UCLA’s three.
The Trojans battled hard in the second half but every time they crawled within single digits, the Bruins had an answer. It seemed that every time UCLA needed a response, someone different was there to answer the call.
“It’s not like we didn’t play hard,” sophomore guard Julian Jacobs said. “Guys are just going to have to put on weight in the offseason.”
Despite their best efforts, USC would get no closer than eight points.
“Every time we cut in to seven or eight in the second half, they stepped up and made a tough shot,” Enfield said. “They deserve the credit.”
A pair of free throws from forward Kevin Looney, giving the Bruins an 80-67 lead all but sealed a victory with less than four minutes to play.
Freshman Elijah Stewart was phenomenal for the Trojans once again. The former Westchester High standout led USC with 14 points, four rebounds, one assist and one block.
Reinhardt chipped in 22 points, two rebounds, and two assists and fellow sophomore Nikola Jovanovic contributed a relatively quiet 16 points and five rebounds. It wasn’t enough, however, to overcome a UCLA squad that shot 50 percent for the game, led by Alford’s 23 points and five 3-pointers.
It was a disappointing outing for the Trojans who hoped to spoil UCLA’s senior night and build momentum for the upcoming Pac-12 tournament. As the story has gone this season, the Trojans just couldn’t get over the hump.
The Trojans actually shot a better percentage from the field than the Bruins, but UCLA attempted 14 more shots while committing only half the amount of turnovers as USC.
The Trojans have now lost five straight at the hands of the Bruins, dating back to 2013, and have failed to win a road conference game this season.
To add to the Trojans’ difficulties, junior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic will miss the rest of the season with a torn labrum injury.
USC will end the season last in the Pac-12 standings for the second consecutive year. Though on paper the result looks depressing, USC has a bright future ahead of it. The team has no seniors on the roster and expects to return all five starters for next season.
Next week, the Trojans will take part in the Pac-12 Tournament with the chance to make a run toward the NCAA Tournament, though it will take a few miraculous upsets along the way in order for that to happen.
The team will take on the 5th seed, likely Stanford, in Las Vegas next Wednesday, March 11.
If the starting five returns next year, they’ll go 4-14.  I’m super optimistic, aren’t you?  Fright On!

Leimert Park began and ended differently than all of my other column adventures thus far.  Usually, I have a specific place or event to write about, somewhere I’ve been before or extensively heard about.
This week was slightly different.  There was no specific place or event I wanted to feature, just a general area I’d never explored: the Leimert Park neighborhood just south of Exposition Boulevard. Like most Trojans, I’m frequently drawn north of campus by the towering Downtown skyline, but I rarely venture south of campus without a plan. This week, I decided to explore the south the same way I do Downtown — by wandering around until something cool happens.
In the 1920s, Leimert Park was created as a planned community, complete with the orderly, tree-lined streets and matching rows of Spanish-style homes.  We drove past these well-kept old homes, soul food restaurants, and small mom-and-pop stores before arriving in the historic Leimert Plaza Park.
Today, Leimert Park is recognized as a central hub for African-American arts and culture in Los Angeles. The Leimert Plaza Park is supported by a growing list of organizations, including the office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, the Kwanzaa Heritage Foundation and USC’s own Annenberg Innovation Lab.
The park itself is how I first heard about the neighborhood; its Yelp page is filled with glowing reviews that describe chess tournaments, drum circles and markets. When we arrived at the park, however, it was nearly empty, probably due to the gloomy weather forecast.
So we wandered, Anthony Bourdain, No Reservations-style. Leimert Plaza Park borders the historic Vision Theater and unique storefronts. As we walked through stores, two things immediately stood out: the community’s sense of civic responsibility, and the people’s appreciation for the arts — which often blend together.
In Leimert Park, civic action and the arts collide. A large mural features the quote, “The good of the village outweighs the good of the individual.” An art gallery displays a sticker reading, “No day in a person’s life should pass without an act of charity.” Telephone poles are equally covered with flyers encouraging residents to vote and announcing free performing arts classes.
Storeowners sell their wares bazaar-style, resulting in an open atmosphere. There’s Jamaican food, homemade tribal masks and a healing center. Relaxed and friendly, community members often sit outside chatting.
The neighborhood seems like it should be infiltrated by hipsters and new businesses, but it isn’t.  Instead, Leimert Park has remained completely authentic.  Unlike many historic parts of Los Angeles, the cultural sites of Leimert Park aren’t mixed in with trendy restaurants and chain businesses. Leimert Plaza Park is purely Leimert Plaza Park.
“This feels like it would be a tourist stop, but there’s no tourists,” commented one of my friends.
Just as we were about to leave, a community member rushed out of his store.  “Are you writing an article about us?” he asked.  Tentatively, I answered yes. “Come back tomorrow, that’s when the art walk is,” he explained. He eagerly pointed to a hidden jazz venue, before launching into a list of other events the neighborhood offers.
So the next day, we returned to the now-crowded park. There was drumming, DJs and dancing. More of a block party than a farmer’s market, the event served as a microcosm of the neighborhood’s familial atmosphere. This meant that we stood out as non-residents, as if we were strangers from a block over.  But, residents are friendly and quick to pitch their goods.
We sampled homemade shea butter, and I was talked into buying a cardinal and gold bracelet by a friendly seller. The community’s sense of civic action even echoes through their wares, with shirts touting the well-known phrase, “black lives matter.”
Residents share a sense of passion for their cause, for their products and for each other. Within just a two-mile radius of campus, the neighborhood itself is small, but it boasts large community pride. The area even hosts its own news site, the Leimert Park Beat, which lists upcoming events.
I learned about the art walk by simply walking down the street, and the more time I spent in the neighborhood, the more unique activities I heard about. I’ll return soon on a Thursday, when Project Blowed presents its weekly, famously long-running hip-hop show. And with jazz performances, theater shows and performing arts classes, the event list goes on and on. I entered Leimert Park with a vague story idea, but left with a long arts and culture to-do list.

One of these days I will definitely call my cousin out in L.A. and check him, and go see Leimert Park for myself. Patronize the local businesses, and vibe with the people and the street scene  I will definitely do that. 
I love stories like these. I love seeing a black community thrive. Leimert Park village is bustling with African-American cultural events and thriving and vibrant black owned businesses.Chinese got Chinatown, Japanese got Japantown, Vietnamese got Little Saigon, Italians got Little Italy, and Mexicans got mexicantown, but we got Leimert Park Village. Our blacktown. Right there in L.A.  Tom Bradley lived there, Jon Singleton lives there now. And he ain’t gonna live in a rat hole. That’s why the Spanish style homes are so damn nice cause its kept up by a large concentration of successful black owned businesses. And blacks are patronizing those businesses. Cause otherwise the place would be a damn shit house. Cause if you fail to circulate your dollars in your own community, you got no right to complain about nothing. You got no one to blame but yourself. Simple as that.

Shakespeare was a genius — there’s no denying that. His plays are still performed and celebrated now, 399 years after his death. His impact on the English language was massive.
For some, his 17th century English, however, can be a big hurdle to overcome. For others, the English isn’t so challenging, but there are only so many times one can enjoy Othello before moving on to other works. It is for these reasons that modern twists on Shakespearean tales will always be welcome, if done right. Romeo & Juliet: Love is a Battlefield, a new performance at the Rockwell Table & Stage in Loz Feliz, is done very well. Blending the Bard’s classic story of woe with a slate of crackling Pat Benatar anthems, the show is far from boring and puts a fun twist on the story.
The plot remains unchanged from Shakespeare’s 1597 quarto. Montagues and Capulets are feuding, Romeo and Juliet develop the mother of all forbidden loves and tragedy ensues. The story has been moved from Verona to Palestona. As an attempt at modernization, the story is inserted into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But that is almost a red herring. If it weren’t for all the times they say “Palestona” and the corresponding Star of David and crescent moon tattoos for the now-Israeli Montagues and the Palestinian Capulets, one would not notice the difference. Where this show excels is the insertion of gushy ’80s anthems.
Songs like “Heartbreaker” and “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” were not megahits for their lyrical nuance. They’re large-scale and loud and unabashedly corny. “Heartache to heartache we stand/ no promises/ no demands/ love is a battlefield” isn’t exactly Dylanesque in terms of subtlety, but it sure is fun to belt out at the top of one’s voice.
Normally this would not jive well with one of the classic stories of the English language. But here is Shakespeare’s dirty little secret: while the way he used his words were so revolutionary they changed the English language, his actual stories are not that complex. When his star-crossed lovers fall for each other, they fall for each other immediately and completely. There’s no courtship or emotional buildup. They suffer the strongest ever case of love at first sight and are immediately infatuated with each other. And when things go wrong, complete anguish consumes the lovers. Shakespeare doesn’t mess around with shades of grey; only the biggest, brashest emotions were in his palette. So, actually, Pat Benatar songs pair extremely well with the material.
Right after Romeo falls for his Juliet, they meet up and sing “Heartbreaker.” Neither actor holds back. “Your love is like a tidal wave/ spinning over my head,” it’s blunt, but it also pretty much captures the emotions floating around the two heads of the smitten Palestonans. As alluded to before, they’re immediately maxed out in terms of being in love. There are worse ways to express this than gleefully belting out lyrics about their soul being set on fire, burning out of control.
Plus, its helps when the actors are really good at it. Juliet is played by Ashley Argota, who puts on a lovely performance. She has the voice to carry Benatar’s passionate, soaring vocals but also provides an alluring charm to her character. She has appeared on The Fosters on ABC Family and was young Nala in the national tour of The Lion King. She’s impressive and the spotlight suits her. Compared to her, Rustin Cole Sailors’ Romeo is a bit overshadowed. He puts on a fine performance, but everyone on the cast does a great job. Nicci Claspell, who plays a much younger nurse character than what one is familiar with in past renditions of the play, knocks a performance of Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got To Do With It,” out of the park. Jameson Moss plays the friar — he was last seen as one of Emma Stone’s fake conquests on Easy A — and also puts his great voice on display. So, despite Sailors’ adequate performance of Romeo, he fails to separate himself from the crowd, as Argota does.
The show itself is unique. The Rockwell Table & Stage is more cabaret than theater, as all the guests are seated at tables and eat and drink as the show goes on around them. Romeo climbs up on the back of chairs; Juliet sings from both side walls. There isn’t much in terms of set, but that is made up for by the immersive experience that is brought by the singers moving about all around the room.
Logistically, that movement does bring about the biggest drawback of the show. There are six columns in the middle of the room and as the performance moves around the room it is not uncommon to be obstructed by the very structure of the room. Some of the seats are sold as “partial view seating,” but it is difficult to imagine any of the seats offering an unobstructed view of the show throughout the entire performance. It is a small shame but overall, does not overshadow the very strong entertainment value of one of Shakespeare’s most beloved stories with the bombastic anthems to match it in spirit.

Grocery shopping takes on a whole new meaning when it’s not an errand that you run with your mom or dad. Suddenly, you’re an upperclassman in college. You have a kitchen in your apartment and a grocery store close to campus, but you have no list prepared. You’re on your own. You have to buy, prepare and cook your own food. Put down that takeout menu — you can do this. Below are three recipes for three delicious and somewhat nutritious meals that will cost so little that you’ll still be able to go to that concert you’ve been saving up for. Maybe you’re cooking to impress a date, or maybe you just want to grow up. Either way, use these recipes to give your body a break from the constant barrage of EVK and Chipotle.
Fancy-Pants Peanut Butter and Jelly
This first recipe is for the very lazy and/or child in you. With only four ingredients and no cooking necessary, the results are scrumptious. It’s a twist on the ever-so classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich that all, except for those with allergies, have enjoyed.
Ingredients:
-1 jar of peanut butter
-1 jar of jelly (preferrably strawberry)
-1 jar of honey
-2 slices of whole wheat bread
There are no definite measurements for this recipe. Place a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter in a bowl. Pour about a spoonful and a half of honey in with the peanut butter and mix until the two are completely combined. Then add equal spoonfuls of jelly and mix once more. Leave the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes. Spread the mixture on the bread. Fold each piece of bread in half or put one on top of the other (there are two different types of people in the world) and enjoy.
Deceivingly Simple Grilled Garlic Chicken
This recipe is for when you want to try and be a grown-up without actually having to take on too much responsibility.
Ingredients:
-1 boneless, skinless chicken breast
-Minced garlic
-Chopped onion
-Frozen pre-cooked brown rice
-Olive oil
Set a pan on the stove at about 70 percent heat and pour a tablespoon of olive oil into the pan. Cut the chicken breast into bite-size portions. Next, cover each portion in about 1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic. Place the pieces of chicken in the pan and wash off your cutting board. Chop 1/4 cup worth of onion and sprinkle it over the chicken. Grill the chicken in the pan for about eight minutes, flipping once. The chicken should be juicy, golden brown on the outside and white on the inside. There should be no red or pink areas on the inside.
While the chicken cooks, place the brown rice in the microwave and follow the instructions on the packaging. Prepare your choice of vegetables for extra nutrients.
Almond Fudge
This recipe is a very easy and surprisingly healthy dessert. And don’t worry — “healthy” is not code for disgusting. This dessert is the best of both worlds.
Ingredients:
-Parchment paper
-Almond butter
-Coconut oil
-Maple syrup
-Cocoa powder
-Salt
-Shredded coconut
Take out a sheet of parchment paper. Place a small pot over low heat. Then place 1/2 cup of almond butter and 1/3 cup of coconut oil into the pot. Stir until completely melted. Turn off the stove and stir in 1/4 cup of maple syrup, 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, 1/3 cup of shredded coconut and a pinch of rock salt. Place a piece of the parchment paper on a tray and pour the fudge onto the paper. Place the tray into the freezer for about 15 minutes. Remove from freezer, and take to savor your creation.

Last week, Boris Nemtsov, former deputy prime minister and leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was assassinated blocks away from the Moscow Kremlin. With such a high-profile murder occurring right under the nose of the Kremlin, Putin is sending a clear and incontrovertible message: Dissent has no home in Russia.
Nemtsov was a leading figure in Russia during its post-Soviet years. Under President Boris Yeltsin, Nemtsov led reforms that began erasing the parameters of communism, which stagnated the Russian economy, and started to implement policies for a nascent capitalist system. His efforts led him to be vice premier and his liberalist vision for a better Russia was lauded in the country for its reform and commitment to Russians. During a transformative period for Russia, he represented the change and spirit needed to revamp the antiquated communist-era mentality and attitudes that dominated Russia in the early 1990s. Nemtsov was the impetus for ushering in a new era and what Putin despised.
At the turn of the century, Putin rose to power and stood in stark contrast to the efforts put forth by Nemtsov. While Nemtsov was a reflection of the desire for a better Russia, Putin was the poster boy for antiquated, back-door, cigar-smoking politics that defined the world for much of the 20th century. Putin was president from 2000 to 2008 and undertook a third term in 2012. By holding onto power for so long, Putin has silenced any opposition and parlayed the image that he intends to stay in power. While Russia’s economy undeniably struggled as it transitioned to a more capitalistic system, Putin’s power-hungry stance perpetuated Russia’s struggles and held it back from progress. After decades of carnage, fear and a dark shadow over governmental affairs, Russia was in need of a transition from its deeply damaged bureaucracy to a more transparent, flexible and dependable government. Putin was largely more of the same in Russian politics and has continued to shun the metamorphosis of Russia.
In recent months, Nemtsov vocally opposed Russian military operations in Ukraine. The unsolicited, cold-annexation of Crimea and subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine underscored the aggression of Putin and his ambitions to increase the territory and presence of Russia. In the 21st century age of globalization and apprehension toward threats to national autonomy, Putin has demonstrated a policy that is the antithesis of the ideas and beliefs promoted by the international community. He has repeatedly denied sending any boots on the ground and has rejected accusations of participating in military action. Nemtsov fought to expose the Kremlin’s actions in Ukraine, its shoddy business involving the Sochi Olympics and the profound levels of corruption throughout the Russian government. His death sends a chilling memorandum to domestic Russians that the promotion of ideas and acts antagonistic to those of Putin will not be tolerated. In Putin’s Russia, Nemtsov was one of the last glimmers of hope for a renewed vigor and force of dissent. If Putin’s actions in Ukraine were not evidence enough of his unrelenting power to restore his country to its prior glory across the entire region, then the death of the most famous dissenter in Russia paints a foreboding portrait of the future of the country’s future.
Rather than resign to the maudlin outlook cast by Nemtsov’s death, Russian opposition should not be discouraged. Dissent is a powerful force against despotism and wielding such weapon threatens the belligerence of Putin and his authoritarian rule.
In his country, Putin might be able to silence opposition and quiet dissent, but on the world stage, the spirit of Nemtsov’s struggle persists.

It makes me really sad to see the young people nowadays become so gullible and readily accepting of the mainstream media’s narrative of events going on in the world. What happened to taking a critical look at what is being reported? Based on Nemstov’s death, how can you say that Putin is sending a clear and incontrovertible message that dissent has no home in Russia? Is there a proof that Putin ordered the killing of Nemstov? Ok, lets say that Putin ordered the killing. But does it make any sense? Why would he kill a dissident loved by the west to invite further rebuke and sanctions from the west? Why would he do something that could be easily exploited by the west to bring about a regime change (as the west has done in so many other countries)? Only an utter fool would do something like that and Putin is no fool. If he was a fool, he could never have become the president of Russia. On the other hand, the west has everything to gain by the death of Nemstov. As a living dissident he hadn’t been that useful to the west as is apparent in the long time that the west has been attempting, without any success, to elevate the dissidents to bring about a regime change in Russia. However, as a dead dissident he is of immense use to the west for the reasons I have mentioned above.
I admire that young people are interested in world events, politics and the like. But it is very sad to see them simply regurgitating the prevalent narrative instead of analyzing, asking questions and coming up with original thoughts however unpopular they may be.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month that he and his government encourage the “mass immigration” of Jews from Europe to their “home” of Israel. This announcement came in the wake of extreme and tragic instances of anti-Semitism in Europe.
On Feb. 14, a gunman opened fire in two separate attacks in Copenhagen that killed two people — a documentary filmmaker at a free speech event and a guard outside of a synagogue. The gunman was later killed by police, and others have been arrested in connection with the attacks. Tens of thousands of Danes attended memorials for the victims.
The attacks in Copenhagen mirror January’s terrorist attacks in Paris, which targeted the staff of the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher market. Additionally, in France hundreds of Jewish graves were vandalized with anti-Semitic messages and signs.
Netanyahu also echoed the same sentiments in his speech to Congress on Tuesday. Though he mostly addressed Iran relations and how to counter ISIS-led terrorism, Netanyahu reiterated his stance on how to protect the world’s Jewish population. In allowing Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to continue his tweets that “Israel must be annihilated,” anti-Semitism has spread, and Jews around the world are left vulnerable.
It’s obvious that anti-Semitic acts throughout the world have gained dangerous traction in the last couple of months. Though Netanyahu’s invitation for European Jews to immigrate to Israel seems logical due to the circumstances, it could set a dangerous precedent, as the world cannot afford to see nations lose their religious diversity.
In the face of anti-Semitism, the first step for the Israeli government should not be to evacuate Jews from their homelands, but to act as a voice for marginalized Jews in Europe and elsewhere. Israel can use its national platform to encourage European countries to pass religious tolerance legislation and work toward making peace. As pointed out by Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, Netanyahu is right to say that Israel will always open its arms to the Jewish population around the world, but to “urge” immigration would be a major step backward.
European countries have an equal role in securing the future of religious diversity. As people see Denmark mourning the victims of the Copenhagen attacks, they will be more willing and ready to take action against anti-Semitic crimes. The attacks in Europe should prompt governments to make a concerted effort to reduce hate crime and increase tolerance for people of all religions. A lack of effort on the part of European governments would propagate a sense of nationalism that excludes Jewish identity — an outcome obviously unfavorable to the vast number European citizens in favor of acceptance.
In this case, the potential for a loss of cultural and religious diversity in Europe is significant. The concentration of the world’s Jewish population in Israel sets a dangerous precedent for the congregation of certain religious groups all over the world.
The nation of Israel was formed under special circumstances, circumstances which by no means should be marginalized or deemed unnecessary. However, 70 years after the Holocaust, the world should be ready and willing to do better for the Jewish people by creating safe havens other than just Israel.
Hopefully, one day Israel will be able to exist as a nation unencumbered by the necessity to provide an oasis for Jews from hatred and violence. Until such time, Netanyahu’s suggestion of “mass immigration” might not be out of the question, but it should not be the only way to secure a safe future for Jews around the world.
Lots of “shoulds” about desired world attitudes and actions in Morgan Buckley’s article. In the current world, though, the Israelis must look out for themselves. Based on recent statements from the White House, US Government support for this democracy could dry up. And given the President’s desperate desire to make some kind, any kind, of accommodation, with the fanatical Iranian government, the Israelis may soon be facing the threat of a new Holocaust – a nuclear holocaust launched from Iran.
Europe was also rebuilt in the shadow of European guilt about the
Holocaust. For Europeans who want to get rid of the guilt, supporting the
“Palestinians” allows them to pretend that the Israeli Jews are just as criminal
as the Europeans were at the time of Nazism. The old saying that Europeans will
never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz remains true: to get rid of their guilt,
many Europeans have to find a way to declare that the Jews are guilty — of
anything.
It’s not called immigration when someone leaves a country. It’s called “emigration.” 
P.S. EUROPE FOR THE EUROPEANS. I’m glad that Europe is changing for nationalism. Those non Europeans minorities should leave.

Pentatonix, a nationally-acclaimed a cappella group featuring five vocalists—Scott Hoying (baritone), Kirstin Maldonado (alto), Mitch Grassi (tenor), Avi Kaplan (bass) and Kevin Olusola (beatboxer)—performed at the City National Grove of Anaheim on March 1 on their On My Way Home tour.
After taking first place for the third season of NBC’s The Sing-Off in November 2011, they haven’t stopped with their winning streak, taking home a Grammy just last month. They’ve also amassed more than 7.7 million subscribers on Youtube. They’ve garnered quite the following by covering songs of a large variety of genres.
At the show, fans of all ages — teenagers, moms and dads, grandparents — were lined up hours before the show to snatch a good spot towards the front of their general admission section. It’s only been a couple years since their rise to fame, and Pentatonix is already on their way to reaching a Taylor Swift-esque fan base.
The only downside to the quintet’s performance was the use of risers as a prop on stage. Though they were fancy, well constructed risers, it made the beginning feel like somewhat of a talent show. But that feeling was quickly dispelled when their voices came harmonized over the speakers.
They opened with “Problem” by Ariana Grande, followed by a Beyonce mash-up and popular covers of La La Latch and Rather Be. From Kirstin’s mezzo-soprano to Avi’s resonate deep bass, Pentatonix made full use of their vocal range and charmed the audience with their vocal medleys. At about the half-way point, Kevin Olusola stole the show with his soulful cello playing and his stimulating vocal percussion in the song “Julie-O.” At this point, any other a cappella group would’ve went on and sang through their pieces and ended the show at that. That’s not what they did. After their closing song, they came out for an encore, and performed two pieces that left the audience speechless and full of glee (Get it? Glee’s all about a capella).
They decided to turn off the microphones to sing “That’s Christmas to Me,” and established an intimacy with the audience that’s never been seen before. It was like the cherry on top of a wonderful <insert your favorite flavor here> a capella sundae. Closing with their Grammy-winning song “Daft Punk,” Pentatonix made it evident that they did not need an opener, and held up their name and fame with their remarkable 90-minute show.
Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to note Kirstin Maldonado proper spelling of her first name.

Blue and black, or white and gold?

If you’re a functioning human with access to the Internet and basically any form of social media profile, you probably know what that means. Last Thursday, Feb. 26, people across the world fiercely debated the color of a dress in a picture that originated on Tumblr. Classes were delayed so students and their professors could argue about it. Psychology lectures halted to discuss visual perception and top-down processing. Group text messages blew up with friends questioning one another’s competence. People questioned their own competence and sanity.
Quite simply, a poorly lit photograph of an article of clothing broke the Internet more than Kim Kardashian ever will.

The great dress debate prompted mixed reactions. Celebrities tweeted, passionately defending the color scheme that they saw even though many, like Taylor Swift, acknowledged that they didn’t quite understand why it was so important. (But then again, who did?)
 
In classic Tumblr fashion, many sarcastic photo edits were made mocking the members of the opposite “team” (the teams being “team black and blue” and “team white and gold”).

 
So why did people care so much? Of course the dress itself isn’t important. Actual pictures of the dress surfaced revealing that it is, in fact, blue and black. And with that the global buzz more or less fizzled out. A week later people still joke about it and Ellen DeGeneres gave the people who took the original photo peace-making half blue and black and half white and gold Ellen underwear so that everyone could be right. And with that, nobody really cared anymore.

 
Though the whole debate is basically the definition of a first world problem and a time waster, the fact that #TheDress was tweeted over a million times is remarkable. It goes to show that while people are usually reluctant to have conversations about hard-hitting issues via social media, they are eager to engage in global conversations (friendly reminder that millions of people argued over the color of a dress…). While people are scared that they may get facts wrong or may face public disapproval when voicing opinions about pressing political or social issues, they long to share and connect when the stakes are lower and content is more trivial. Social media is so pervasive in our culture that the millennials who’ve grown up with it have been conditioned to spread content and share their opinions online. This explains why our parents wondered why we cared so much about the color of a dress, whereas our generation felt it was of the utmost importance to find out whether our friends saw blue and black or white and gold.

No matter which colors you saw, perhaps think twice about the relevance of the things that pop up on your Tumblr dashboard or your Facebook newsfeed. That’s not to say that you should stop paying attention to and spreading cat videos and pictures of dresses with controversial color schemes. But perhaps consider using the power of your voice and whatever platform you’re using for slightly more important things too.

We’ve all probably tried green tea and cheesecake at some point in our lives, but what about green tea cheesecake?
Matcha green tea powder is sweeping the health and culinary worlds for both its flavorful qualities and for its many unexpected health benefits. We all know that brewed green tea is healthy, so imagine spicing up your diet with matcha powder which is the highest­grade green tea powder out there coming from actual ground and refined leaves.
Being such a high quality of tea, Matcha can be pricey. You can opt for a lower, culinary grade matcha powder which will still have certain benefits and a flavor to it. Or if you have the means to splurge, go for the high quality stuff. Matcha can be found in certain supermarkets or even on Amazon. Just be careful and check the ingredients of a product­some matcha powders contain additives like flavoring and sugar. If you’re serious about your matcha, check out this helpful review of different brands and varieties.
The powder is full of antioxidants and can help improve memory, boost metabolism, increase concentration, help cholesterol, and has soothing mental effects. So why not make matcha lattes, smoothies, muffins or even mini cheesecakes?
Check out this recipe for a fun twist on a traditional dessert.
Ingredients: 
For crust:
For cheesecake:
Prepare the crust first by mixing the dry ingredients together and then combining them with the melted butter. *Note: The crust recipe was originally meant for an entire pie/cheesecake crust, and I only ended up using about half of the mixture if you want to try halving the recipe.

Line a muffin pan with liners and press an even amount of the crust mixture into each spot.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Bake the crust on its own for about 7 minutes in a 350 degree heated oven.
Whisk by hand or if you’re a lucky college student and have a Kitchenaid mixer, put it to good use and mix the cream cheese until smooth. Add sugar and continue mixing for a few minutes or until your arm is sore, and then add each egg individually and combine ingredients thoroughly after each addition. Add the vanilla and matcha powder. (I actually forgot the vanilla extract, but the recipe was fine without it, and use as little or as much matcha as you prefer.)
Spoon the now green batter into the prepared and baked muffin liners. I had enough batter for 12 “cakes.”
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Bake for about 20 minutes at 300 degrees and let cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours (or until you can no longer wait) and enjoy a different kind of “healthy” green.
Not in the mood for baking? Matcha can be brewed on its own or can even be thrown into smoothies for an added boost of antioxidants. Although Starbucks claims to serve a green tea frappuccino made with matcha powder, many have discovered that the drink comes with many unwanted and not­so­healthy additives. Try making your own frappuccino with this easy recipe:
Blend together:
And sip up the green goodness!
