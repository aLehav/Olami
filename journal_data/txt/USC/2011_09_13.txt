Alumnae told students about how they faced and overcame different challenges as female leaders in the USC community Tuesday.
About 40 students and staff attended “Become empowered with Michele Dedeaux Engemann, Carol Fox & Lorna Reed” as part of the Student Affairs’ Campus Conversations series in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The three women have all served as Alumni Association president and on the USC Board of Trustees, among other university leadership positions.

When Reed joined USC’s Board of Trustees in 1982, she said male colleagues “treated [her] like a little girl” and didn’t appreciate her ideas.
“It was a very deflating experience because I had never been discounted before,” Reed said.
Reed said this frustrated her, so she talked to her husband, who told her to “take the bulls by the horn.” Afterwards she became more assertive to ensure her ideas were heard.
“I became an advocate for myself and stood up for my ideas,” she said. “[Women’s] advantage today is that doesn’t exist anymore.”
She said after she became more assertive, her peers started listening to her.
Engemann said she didn’t face particular challenges as a woman at USC because she felt supported by her school, family and friends.
“I don’t think it’s because you’re a woman that you’re challenged,” Engemann said. “We’re all challenged.”
Fox said her biggest challenge was balancing family and work.
“There were times I had to back off because family was the most important thing,” Fox said.
She said she solved this problem by doing work from home so she could continue her work with USC and be with her family at the same time.
Students said they were surprised by how inclusive the USC campus was in the past.
“I learned that even a lot of male colleagues back then were really supportive at USC,” said Ruth Barber, a junior majoring in Spanish and biology. “They were asked to step up to leadership positions [by men]. I didn’t know that about USC.”
Reed emphasized the importance of being focused on a path.
“You not only have to have passion, but you also have to choose your path,” Reed said. “Choose your path and go for it.”
Kosiso Ugwueze, a junior majoring in English and international relations, said she found the panelists’ achievements and stories inspiring and motivating.
“It was very inspirational to see my fellow women [and] to see their achievements and their Trojan Pride,” Ugwueze said. “I really enjoyed seeing the female Trojan spirit.”
Jeremy Slap, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and neuroscience, said the panelists’ gender didn’t affect his perception of the event.
“I interpreted the talk as transferring wisdom from an older generation to a younger generation,” Slap said. “A lot of what was said corroborated with my own values. I had my beliefs strengthened.”

In the never-ending war on plagiarism, higher education experts have raised new concerns over the credibility of Turnitin after its parent company launched WriteCheck, which allows students to check for plagiarism for a small fee.
Plagiarism · WriteCheck aims to help students recognize plagiarism and avoid grammatical errors. Critics argue, however, that the website allows students to avoid getting caught for plagiarism before submitting a paper. - Photo illustration by Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
With the advent of WriteCheck in 2009, college professors nationwide have recently raised complaints that errant students now have a tool to circumvent popular plagiarism detection software.
Faculty at USC began using Turnitin in fall 2008 to identify plagiarism in large classes. At USC, more than 100 documented cases of plagiarism were reported during the 2010-11 academic year, according to Student Judicial Affairs.
Originally released in 1996, Turnitin detects plagiarism by checking submissions against a database of millions of archived papers, journals, periodicals and books.
In an article last week in The Chronicle of Higher Education David E. Harrington, professor at Kenyon College, however, raised the issue that over-reliance on artificial means of detecting plagiarism like Turnitin could lead to some clear violations going unnoticed.
Elinor Accampo, a USC history professor, uses multiple means — in addition to Turnitin — to discourage and to detect plagiarism.
“I make it really clear that, if a student violates academic integrity in any way, they get an F in the course,” Accampo said.
Accampo also said she creates assignments she believes are difficult or impossible to copy from somewhere else and watches out for “red flags,” such as discrepancies between in-class and out-of-class writing.
Most professors and students agree Turnitin discourages students from plagiarizing.
“When students use Turnitin, they know they have a higher chance of being caught so they aren’t going to pull from wikipedia or something,”  said Moriah Burton, a senior majoring in film and television production. “They know that the website will know what Wikipedia says and they’re going to get caught.”
The last plagiarism case Accampo saw dealt with a student she caught “very easily” thanks to Turnitin. Though, he is aware of the program’s limitations, Accampo acknowledged it is almost impossible to get away with plagiarizing from works already within Turnitin’s database.
“The work that a student would have to do to get around Turnitin would make it his or her own paper anyway,” Accampo said.
WriteCheck, however, provides a student with complete, advanced access to the same database used by Turnitin for $7 per paper.
“WriteCheck helps students check for plagiarism and correct grammar, style and spelling errors with user-friendly reports and helpful resources to improve writing,” according to its website.
Some students, however, said they would not use WriteCheck because it is not academically honest.
“I do find [WriteCheck] unethical,” said Graham Higgins, a junior majoring in film production. “I wouldn’t want anything to do with it.”
Many students, however, have never heard of WriteCheck.
“If knowledge of WriteCheck were more widespread,” said Holly Morris, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “I’m sure people would use it.”
Other students said Turnitin does not know everything and can accidentally accuse honest students of cheating if they have writing styles similar to that of their sources.
James Collins II, a professor of classics, said that instructors and students should not rely on technology to detect plagiarism.
“I don’t think embracing technology like Turnitin is going to solve the problem,” Collins said. “I would encourage more open dialogue about integrity and honor.”
Turnitin is a joke. It’s so easy to work around their pattern algorithms it’s not even funny.

USC remains the 23rd best university in the nation in U.S. News & World Report’s 2012 college rankings released Tuesday, but it moved up in the “Up-and-Coming Schools” list from No. 11 to No. 8.
The Up-and-Coming Schools list identifies universities making “promising and innovative changes” to student, academic and faculty life. The schools are ranked based on peer votes from college officials.
“USC’s reputation has been strengthening over the past 20 years,” said Kirk Brennan, USC director of admissions. “It is more of a long-term trend than any sort of short-term recent change. People are finally catching up to the great things that are happening here.”
Steve Wolfsohn, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said receiving a high rank in the up-and-coming category shows the university’s ambition.
“It’s nice to know that we are at the top, but we’re not settling,” Wolfsohn said.
In the rankings of best national colleges overall, USC is again tied with Carnegie Mellon for No. 23 — as it was in last year’s rankings — and sits between Georgetown University (No. 22) and UCLA (No. 25).
USC is the only top-25 university to also be ranked on the up-and-coming schools list.
Since 1991, when then-President Steven B. Sample began leading USC, the school has moved up 28 spots in the national university ranking to where it currently sits.
“Movement happens only occasionally,” Brennan said. “I think we made a big jump a year or two ago — that’s good. Reputation is one of larger components in these rankings and I think President [C. L. Max] Nikias’ campaign to boost endowments will make a difference.”
Since his inauguration last October, Nikias has raised more than $1 billion dollars in large gifts to USC. This includes a $200-million donation from David and Dana Dornsife to the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences in October 2010.
The USC Marshall School of Business undergraduate programs went up one spot to No. 9 in the nation since last year’s ranking of No. 10. For programs at the graduate level, the Viterbi School of Engineering is ranked No. 11 and the Rossier School of Education is ranked No. 14.
“All our deans are doing terrific things, the more people talk about them and more people become aware internationally and the better it is,” Brennan said. “It’s not a surprise that Marshall did extremely well. It is a great program.”
The U.S. News & World Report college rankings are based on a weighted combination of key indicators, including class sizes, average freshman retention rate, faculty resources, peer evaluations and high school counselor evaluations. The alumni giving rate accounts for 5 percent of the total ranking score.
For Stephanie Fong, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, USC’s ranking at No. 23 indicates it is one of the best colleges in the nation. “That’s why I came here,” Fong said.
Current USC students can rejoice in the school’s standing above its rival university — UCLA at No. 25 — but the rankings play an important role for high school students, such as Jimmy Chen, who are still deciding which college to attend.
“I wouldn’t want to think that it’s a giant factor, but it is pretty important,” Chen said. “Since I can’t visit or know about all the campuses, it is nice to have some outside source telling me what is good.”
Chen is currently a high school senior in Portland, Ore. He said he plans to apply to USC after hearing from friends about the university.
“I know that USC has good academics, so now I am just trying to figure everything else out,” Chen said. “I haven’t visited the campus yet, but I know a lot of people from my high school who have gone to USC and they seem to like it a lot.”

Beverly Hills usually prides itself on an air of exclusivity. But Thursday night, Rodeo Drive stores kept their doors open late for shoppers of many sorts with a welcoming approach and fun for all, ushering in a new era of friendly consumerism.
Fashion’s Night Out began in 2009 as a joint initiative of American Vogue, The City of New York and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, an association built to support American fashion talent. By convincing stores to host special events on the opening night of New York Fashion Week, the cooperative hoped to put enthusiasm back in consumer spending during a time when sales were sluggish.
This year, more than 100 cities in the United States participated, including several parts of Los Angeles. In Beverly Hills alone, more than 100 stores wooed shoppers with everything from free champagne and bites of Bottega Louie chocolate at Juicy Couture to nail polishes exclusively for Fashion’s Night Out at Chanel.
Fendi featured a photography display shot by Karl Lagerfeld, while Gucci presented a special edition 90th anniversary Fiat designed by Frida Giannini, the brand’s creative director. Lanvin may have had the most creative approach—it set up a stage in the middle of the store and held a dance-off to mimic its fall ad campaign which features models breaking out in retro moves.
But these weren’t even half of the attractions.
The city closed down Rodeo Drive to traffic and welcomed 17 of the city’s food trucks, which are a far cry from the area’s usual white tablecloth dining, but equally as delicious. The casual atmosphere was well received; shoppers sat on the street’s exquisitely clean sidewalks and chowed down on lobster rolls from the Lobsta Truck and ice cream sandwiches from Coolhaus. The Sprinkles truck served a specially decorated red velvet cupcake in honor of the event.
The night’s standout feature was a four-story Ferris wheel on the south end of the street, an attraction that guests could present a receipt from any store to gain admission. The top of the ride offered views of some of Beverly Hills’ historic landmarks, as well as of the cheerful crowds below. Some parents even brought along their children for a little carnival fun, which signaled the entire motive of the night.
Families were able to enjoy the same attractions as the West Coast editors of Vogue. Thousands flocked to a street that may have previously been unchartered territory. Considering the expenses of drinks and DJs, stores may not have had their most lucrative night. The long-term effects could prove to be worthwhile.
The Thursday evening spent in Beverly Hills was one of changed impressions. Event-goers got an entirely new perspective on the row of shops in Los Angeles’ high-end shopping mecca. As one of the most expensive streets in the city, it is easy to be intimidated as a tourist and as a local.
On Fashion’s Night Out, however, everyone was welcomed into the stores without a hint of arrogance. Attendees sparked conversation with the salespeople; everyone seemed to share the same enthusiasm for the new season of clothes and a new round of ad campaigns—the way shopping should be.
If Thursday night was any indication of a new, friendlier direction that retailers are taking, perusing stores can be fun regardless of one’s intent to spend.
We are fortunate to live so close to a place where the world’s fashions convene, and Fashion’s Night Out has served as a reminder of that. Even without all the bells and whistles that accompanied Thursday’s festivities, anyone can have fun just window shopping.
Purchasing a perfume or nail polish can be a great way to get your hands on a Chanel shopping bag without breaking the bank. Unfortunately, the time for FNO’s exclusive colors has passed; maybe that just means we will all have to wait until next year to get our hands on 2012’s mementos.

USC senior guard Jio Fontan started his long recovery back to the basketball team Tuesday morning as he underwent surgery on his torn left anterior cruciate ligament at the Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center in Los Angeles,  according to a USC press release.
“Jio had successful surgery [Tuesday] and is recovering well,” USC associate head coach Bob Cantu said via Twitter. “We are wishing him the best and know he will be back to have a great senior [year].”
Last season Fontan was second on USC’s basketball team in points per game (10.5) and assists per game (four).
Fontan, who was slated to be the Trojans’ star player this season, will likely miss the entire season after he injured himself during the USC basketball team’s tour in Brazil on Aug. 16.
Fontan averaged 28.5 points per game in the first two games of the tour before he hurt his knee.

For a 2-0 team, there sure is a lot of negativity surrounding USC.
Elite level · After recording four sacks last season, junior defensive end Nick Perry has notched two sacks through two games in 2011. - Daily Trojan file photo
Fans are clamoring for bigger margins of victory, fewer penalties and turnovers and gosh darnit, would USC coach Lane Kiffin just go for one?
Some of the criticism is justified: Two fumbles, one interception and six untimely penalties nearly cost USC a victory over Utah in a game in which USC was clearly the superior team.
But 2-0 is 2-0, and there are plenty of things to be excited about.
With 10 games remaining on the season slate, here are five reasons to be optimistic about USC football.
 
Reason No. 1: Robert Woods, superstar
The opening act was brilliant: second-year wide receiver Robert Woods had one of the best freshman seasons in school history in 2010, leading the Trojans in receiving and earning All-Pac-10 first team honors as a standout kick returner.
But what would the sensational sophomore do for an encore?
Two games in, Woods has already put himself squarely in the discussion of the country’s premier wideouts. He’s tied with Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd with a nation-best 25 receptions and his 17 catches in the opener broke a school record.
So high are the expectations for Woods now that his eight-catch, 102-yard performance against Minnesota was greeted mostly by yawns from USC supporters.
Currently on pace for a 150-catch, 1,674-yard season (both would be all-time bests for USC wide receivers), Woods could do some serious rewriting of the Trojan records books if he keeps up his torrid start.
 
Reason No. 2: The offensive line quieting doubters
Heading into last week’s game against Utah, Kiffin told the media after one practice that the Utes’ defensive line was “the best front four we’ve seen and had to face” since taking over as coach in January 2010.
The much-maligned Trojans’ offensive line — having only two players with significant Division I experience prior to this season — responded by allowing only one sack and opening holes for senior running back Marc Tyler’s 113-yard day on the ground. Redshirt freshman running back D.J. Morgan was also the beneficiary of some huge gaps to run through.
Kiffin didn’t seem to trust the big men up front in the opener against Minnesota: The Trojans ran the ball only on roughly one-third of the offensive snaps and junior quarterback Matt Barkley completed a majority of his 34 pass connections on short routes designed to get the ball out quickly.
If USC’s offensive line continues to play like it did against Utah, Kiffin and company can employ a more balanced run-pass attack and take more shots downfield.
 
Reason No. 3: The improved pass rush
The USC defensive line was, by most accounts, one of the strengths of the 2010 team. The Trojans, however, combined for only 28.5 sacks on the season and no player posted more than four and a half sacks on the year — the lowest total for a USC sack leader since 1991.
USC has already sacked the opposing quarterback six times in the first two games of the 2011 season, putting them on pace for 36 sacks for the year.
Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn didn’t look comfortable in the pocket during Saturday’s game, which led to Utes’ offensive coordinator Norm Chow calling for rollouts on nearly every pass play to buy extra time for Wynn.
Senior linebacker Chris Galippo and redshirt freshman Hayes Pullard have combined for three sacks, senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris has created penetration up the middle, and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey and redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris have looked dangerous on corner blitzes.
The key though is pressure from the defensive end spot. Junior defensive end Nick Perry has two sacks this season, bumping his career total to 14.
The Trojans had only four multiple sack games during all of last season; they are currently two -for-two.
 
Reason No. 4: A special place kicker
Freshman kicker Andre Heidari has only kicked one college field goal so far, but it sure was an impressive one.
Heidari’s 47-yard field goal Saturday gave USC a 3-0 lead and was the longest for a Trojan kicker since David Buehler’s 47-yarder in 2007.
The Bakersfield, Calif., native who has 50-yard plus range, gives Kiffin another point scoring weapon and is the first big-legged kicker for USC since Buehler graduated in 2008.
 
Reason No. 5: Matt Barkley
It’s not all about the quarterback in college football, but it sure helps to have a really good one. Barkley has been superb to start the season, completing more than 70 percent of his passes and throwing four touchdowns to only one interception.
That might not be entirely good news for USC fans hoping Barkley will spurn NFL millions — at least temporarily — and stick around for his senior season.
Let’s make that four and a half reasons to be optimistic about USC football.

It is not always easy to look past the bikini-clad athletes that have dominated the beach volleyball scene. Those fans able to look away, however, have surely noticed a constant coaching presence on the sandy sidelines.
A new home · The outdoor basketball courts near Parking Structure X will eventually house training facilities for USC’s sand volleyball program. - Emily Tat | Daily Trojan
That would be Anna Collier.
Misty May-Treanor, Kerri Walsh and Nicole Branagh are just a few of the many beach volleyball stars Collier has coached, along with Holly McPeak and Nancy Reno in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games and Annette Davis and Jenny Johnson in the 2000 Sydney Games.
Collier is charged with developing the next generation of beach volleyball stars as the coach of the new USC women’s sand volleyball team, scheduled to debut in spring 2012.
“USC wanted somebody with the experience necessary to set a good foundation for the program, and hopefully win right away,” Collier said.
Collier’s style is unique because she emphasizes track workouts, as she served as the women’s cross-country and track and field coach at Santa Monica College. She was also the chair of the kinesiology and athletics department at Santa Monica College before coming to USC.
“Everybody needs to know how to run track to a certain degree,” Collier said. “When we train, I utilize a lot of running. I can help [my players] by incorporating some of the drills that track and field athletes use to increase speed and jumping ability.”
She can empathize with student-athletes interested in playing indoor and sand volleyball. While attending USC, Collier, who was then known as Anna Biller, competed with the track and field, volleyball, and swimming teams.
Collier played beach volleyball professionally for seven seasons before beginning her coaching career in 1990.
With the season a few months away, Collier’s squad is scheduled to train at the Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica until the scheduled facility is built on the space currently occupied by outdoor basketball courts adjacent to Parking Structure X. The plan is for USC to host the first sand volleyball national championship this season.
Scoring is expected to be match play similar to tennis, with five teams of doubles from each school competing to be the first to earn three victories, Collier said.
Nike is still developing the uniforms, but NCAA rules will require the midriff to be covered.
Players coming to USC on a sand volleyball scholarship will not be allowed by the NCAA to play indoor volleyball. Student-athletes on indoor volleyball scholarships, however, can play sand volleyball.
Geena Urango, who played four seasons of indoor volleyball at USC, will receive the first sand volleyball scholarship. Five players are scheduled to train with Collier in the fall, with players from the indoor volleyball team filling out the rest of the squad in the spring.
“I believe strongly in all indoor players training on the sand,” Collier said. “Indoor in recent years has become very specialized by position. In sand volleyball, you have to do it all, so you become a better all-around player.”
Since being hired in July, Collier has worked closely with indoor volleyball coach and director Mick Haley and the sand program’s assistant coach Cookie Stevens, who holds the same position with the indoor team.
“I am very fortunate to have Mick and Cookie’s experience to help guide me through the administrative issues of starting an emerging sport,” Collier said. “I am good to go with the coaching aspect, but I have not coached at the NCAA Division I level, and there are a lot of rules and regulations.”
Collier did not hesitate when asked about her immediate goal for the program.
“I want to make sure that we create the kind of program USC can be proud of,” Collier said.
Pinned in by the 110 on one side and Parking Structure X on the other, you can close your eyes, breath in the Freeway fumes, and just imagine being on the beach. Are you kidding Haden. This is the best we can do?
Whats next, a bowling team on the Expo line? Can’t you find this team a lot north of Jefferson and build them a proper practise faciltiy?
Well, as least with title IX addressed, we can now have a men’s soccor team, can’t we?

USC’s Pac-12 opener against Utah marked the season debut for senior tailback Marc Tyler, who was reinstated last week following a suspension from parts of training camp and the Trojans’ season opener against Minnesota.
Runnin’ it · A week after rushing for 113 yards and one touchdown against Utah, senior tailback Marc Tyler looks to take over as the Trojans’ permanent starter as they host Syracuse on Saturday at the L.A. Coliseum in nonconference action. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Against the Utes, Tyler finished with 24 carries for 113 yards and one touchdown, earning USC Credit Union Student-Athlete of the Week honors.
“I wouldn’t say it felt easier than last year, but I was more comfortable,” Tyler said after Tuesday’s early morning practice. “I feel that I am more mentally tough this year because of everything I have been through.”
Tyler, who lost 13 pounds since the spring, feels more prepared to take on the remaining season.
“It feels good to be down there with the first team offense and not be over there with the black jersey on,” he said. “Being around all the guys, [you] feel like you’re part of something again.”

Junior left Matt Kalil’s  game-saving blocked field goal by helped earn USC its first Pac-12 victory. Kalil, who recently moved to special teams voluntarily, hopes to block seven field goals this year.
“At Fresno State there was a guy that blocked seven,” he said. “I’ve already blocked five so far, so I’m trying to beat that.”
With improvement made for the Trojans on special teams with two blocked field goals through two games, USC looks to carry that success from the first half over to the rest of the game.
“I think it goes back to the first half,” Kalil said. “We’re doing really well in the first half and we diminish the second half. I think that’s what we got to fix. Finishing strong in the second half of games and less turnovers.”
—
Though freshman kicker Andre Heidari has not been used much by the coaching staff so far, he is adjusting to his role with the team.
Heidari added a 47-yard field goal for USC in the first quarter against the Utes to give the Trojans an early lead.
“I thought I was going to be nervous going into the first and second game,” Heidari said. “When I get out there, it is kind of nerve-wracking, but you just got to go out there and do your thing.”

Redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown worked with the first unit defense in place of redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris.
“We’re giving Anthony a shot,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “He’s another one of those young guys in that class that we signed that has done some good things. He’s physical, a good tackler and really wants to be good.”
Aside from Brown, freshmen offensive linemen Marcus Martin and Aundrey Walker were in at guard competing for the starting position.
“We’re going to give the young guys a shot,” Kiffin said. “Hopefully the two true freshmen can help out in there and do some things. But that’s up to them, not to us.”
—
With USC’s upcoming game against Syracuse, the Trojans’ first with the Orange since 1990, Kiffin believes the Orange will not be an easy opponent to face, praising the team’s offense and defense.
“On offense, they have a really good passing quarterback,” Kiffin said. “He’s over 80 percent in the second half of games. Anytime you have a quarterback that is playing extremely well that is as experienced as your opponent, you better be ready to go.”
The USC offense will also have to deal with a strong Syracuse defense.
“They were 17th in the country in total defense last year,” Kiffin said. “We’re going to have our hands full.”
—
With the first two games of the season coming down to the last few minutes of the game, Kiffin addressed criticism regarding junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
“The bottom line is to win the game,” Kiffin said. “In the fourth quarter of the game, we have had the lead. He hasn’t been behind yet; that’s really where an issue comes up. We have been very conservative in our calls to make sure that we win the game and not worry about stats.”

When a play has been in rehearsals for a substantial amount of time, audiences expect the biggest problems on opening night to be technicalities. Worst-case scenario, there’s an understandable disconnect between the characters and the audience that can be fixed through routine tweaking of character portrayals and emotions.
Melodramatic mishap · Scenes of familial strife and relationship drama in To Carry the Child attempt to be dramatic but err on the side of melodrama, making audience members feel overworked and cheated. - Photo courtesy of Steve Jarrard
The opening night, Sept. 9, of To Carry The Child at the Raven Playhouse in North Hollywood found itself in the worst of worst-case scenarios.
Written by Jon Courie, the play tells the story of Ashley, a wannabe artist in the big city who finds out her cancer has returned and moves in with her dysfunctional family in North Carolina. They fight. They yell. They tell each other’s secrets. And they fight and yell some more.
Fundamentally, the play’s biggest problem is its structure. Courie has woven a shoddy web, built off the frail fibers of soap opera drama. The writing is cheap and the dialogue is forced.
Courie seems to believe the only entertaining drama comes from childish banter. Expect two or more yelling arguments per scene. If you’re lucky, that will be the most you get.
Drama shouldn’t stem from the teen-angst-driven emotions of the characters in the play; drama is a product of highly developed characters and believable situations.
Though the drama could very well be pulled from someone’s life today, the dialogue doesn’t have the mastery to convey the characters’ true emotions.
You also know there’s a problem when the main character has to spell out the moral of the show during the final five minutes — complete with pastel blue spotlight and insipid environmental music. As she huddles under the blinding spotlight, Ashley commands the audience to realize the running metaphor throughout the script, announcing “I am the shell.”
The playwright has fallen victim to a dramatist’s nightmare: assuming the audience doesn’t have the ability to read between the lines and to make its own inferences. The writing demeans the audience by speaking down to it and spoon-feeding the meat of the story.
Beyond the detrimental dialogue and story line, the acting became the second most noticeable flaw of the evening. Meg Wallace, who portrayed the hard-to-love Ashley, seemed uncomfortable and stale onstage. Admittedly, while Ashley’s character encompassed those two character traits, these were Wallace’s personal issues.
It played out like the uneasy high school productions most college students are still trying to wipe from their memories. Wallace even looked the high school part. Her costuming labeled her an angsty 13-year-old girl. Her shining moments included the few scenes with her lesbian lover, Diane (Justine Woodford).
Woodford brought out a welcome calm in Wallace that made some moments bearable and even tender.
Fortunately, To Carry The Child has some redemptive qualities, most vividly noticeable in some of the acting. Christine Haeberman successfully portrayed the simple sister Sissy. With her comedic ability and convincing presentation, Haeberman was able to get an occasional laugh. Robin Nuyen as the cynical, sarcastic father fell short of the mark, ironically being a little overemotional for his lines. Though his performance towered over Wallace, the character of Bo simply added to the uncomfortable atmosphere the night was intent upon delivering.
Thankfully, there was Libby, the falsely optimistic mother brought to life by Pamela Daly. Of all the cast members, Daly was able to give the most well-rounded character performance by being not only a protective, worried mother, but a comic in her own right. If you have a mother, you’ll relate with Daly’s interpretation. If you are a mother, you won’t want to.
It’s hard to say where To Carry The Child begins to unravel. It could have been the half-handed direction of Steve Jarrard. It could have been the repelling character portrayals. It might have been the 10th-grade script.
It is said actions speak louder than words, but not the way this cast hollered for two unbearable hours. Acting students be warned: You might want to see this show to learn what not to do in your careers. But if you do have an open weekend, go see Contagion and spare yourself the heavy burden of carrying this child.
Having seen the production the same weekend, I disagree with much of what Di Rosario-Connor wrote. Actually, I think Di Rosario opinions were misguided, while Connor’s were just idiotic. The play is no masterpiece, but it’s well-written, and could be effective if not played as soap opera. Wallace and Woodford are the only actors who do the play justice at all. Daly, singled out for the most praise by Di Rosario AND Connor, gave a performance that might be wonderfully effective in a different play, but she was not connected to the material, was not telling the story. Never for a moment did Daly let humanity and her character’s situations come through. Instead, we got lots of technique and no heart. Nuyen’s reactions were unmotivated, and he played the character way too stupid to suddenly be as reflective as he occasionally chose to be. His leaden pace was maddening as well. 
As for Wallace, her scene late in the play, as her character is near death, is nothing short of extraordinary. It’s her best moment in an overall excellent performance. 
Hollering for two hours? Did we see the same show? Nuyen’s mumbling, Haeberman’s lack of projection, and Daly’s emotionless reading of emotionally climactic lines left me wanting a good deal more hollerin’.
Tenth-grade script? Not everything can be an Ivy League Grad School script like Contagion.
As I scan this review, I find that practically every paragraph says the equivalent of “it was good but it was bad, or “it was bad, only it was good.” I can say with confidence that I know when the review unraveled: it was the second Jamie, Di Rosario and Connor breathlessly began to type.

Video game companies have been capitalizing on their franchises’ special collector’s edition packages for years. But with the economy in shambles, it would make sense for consumers to ignore these flashy, superfluous bundles, right?
Wrong.
Within the world of video games, it seems the state of the economy is basically irrelevant — even now. Hardcore gamers are still going nuts for special edition video game packages.
People have very different reasons for hopping on the consumer bandwagon. Some want the limited items in hopes that they’ll increase in value with time, whereas others just want to brag to their friends about the rare sets they purchased back in the day. No matter what the reason, people clearly enjoy owning these often-superior versions, if they can afford to.
But special edition sets don’t usually come cheap. In fact, they’re often sold at far heftier prices than their bare-bone counterparts — a logical ploy considering the addition of several features.
The most popular splurging is, without a doubt, on some of the biggest franchises. Nintendo’s upcoming addition to its universally acclaimed Legend of Zelda franchise is just a single example of how limited edition packaging and a few songs can drive fans into a gaming heat.
Skyward Sword, set to be released Nov. 20 for the Wii, is on the market at a benchmark price of $50. But its special edition counterpart, which includes a Link-inspired gold Wii remote-plus and a CD celebrating the saga’s 25-year lifespan, is priced at $70. The gold Wii remote-bundle version of Skyward Sword has become GameStop’s top-ranked preordered product in its online branch, surpassing the regular game itself.
Do people really need another Wii remote? Probably not.
Considering the Wii has been out for almost five years now, it’s safe to assume most people who own a console probably have enough functioning Wii remotes to keep them satisfied. But throw in a magical gold controller alongside what is certain to be one of the most impressive Wii games and you’ve got yourself a marketing bullseye.
Even more recently, Sega announced an enormous collector’s edition set for its soon-to-be-released Sonic Generations. The video game, much like Skyward Sword, is an unofficial capstone to the franchise’s legacy and will be available on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 3DS consoles.
But a European- and Australian-only collector’s edition, featuring a figurine, golden ring, art book and soundtrack, has left North American fans outraged. Blog posts by American gamers have revealed that some fans are even considering ordering the British version online just so they can stake a claim on the special bundle package.
Evidently, big-name franchises and their collectible editions can lure gamers as quickly and easily as they can disappoint them.
Think Super Mario All-Stars: 25th Anniversary Edition for the Wii. The extremely limited 2010 release drove holiday shoppers crazy as they searched for copies at an alarmingly intense rate. At the time, a Wii game featuring all four original Mario games in a shiny red box selling for $30 sounded like a steal. But once the Christmas spirit dwindled, so did buyers’ interests.
Though the games were flawless, many felt the edition was not worth its price. The extras, namely a disc of music and a collectible booklet, didn’t impress customers. Furthermore, the game was no more than just that — a simple compilation identical to its 1993 Super Nintendo counterpart. The edition didn’t even contain Super Mario World, a quintessential Mario game.
Special edition packages might not always give customers the quality they deserve, but there’s little denying these types of video game packages have a persistent allure and will continue to for quite some time. Despite the criticism of Super Mario All-Stars, the game continued to sell at impressive rates when Nintendo re-released it in March 2011.
Obviously, the bigger the franchise, the more collector’s editions are made and the better those editions sell.
But even if these special editions seem like a way for companies to simply earn more money, one thing is certain: Bragging rights will never get old.

The best music is personal music. Any musician can sing about archetypal subjects — rage, love, protest and adventure — but some artists convey a sense these topics actually matter to them.
Sincere songwriter · Marling’s lyrics on her latest album, A Creature I Don’t Know, hit listeners with intense raw power and artistic energy. - Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity
When musicians bare their souls, it becomes so much more authentic and captivating. And that’s what Laura Marling brings to her music.
Marling, a British folk singer, possesses a powerful voice and a very personal, almost intimate sense of lyricism and songwriting. Her newest album, A Creature I Don’t Know, is a fresh showcase of her talent and displays a bolder touch to her style. The album is focused on her vocals and acoustic guitar work, but Marling isn’t afraid to let things get more intense with a rock edge.
Marling shows off her talent for wordplay in the first track, “Muse.” With an almost Bob-Dylan-esque delivery, she weaves in lyrics like Spoke of love like hunger / He at once was younger, ever younger, in my hunger for a muse. The song is by no means an upbeat tune, but Marling’s playful tone prevents the song from being categorized as a ballad or ode and is a great introduction to the album and her sound.
Part of what makes her songs so interesting and strangely intimate is the worldliness she infuses into each one. Marling is only 21, but her tracks speak of experiences in love, regret and loss far beyond her years. Mixed with her haunting, almost fragile voice, the album, as a whole, comes full circle as a raw display of intimacy.
It’s this intimate undertone that unites the album, as Marling sings of challenging patriarchal authority in “Salinas” and romantic innocence in “I Was Just a Card.” The topics range, but she threads the album with recurring themes that evoke palpable feelings. It’s not a concept album by any means, but A Creature I Don’t Know is a canvas of vivid emotions brought to song.
Though Marling’s style is rooted in folk — and her albums are mostly soft, haunting tunes — it does not mean the album lacks intensity. Rather than start off with a jam and fast guitars, she builds her songs up with momentum. “The Beast” is a powerful example of this, with the track steadily building in volume and anger. By the end of the song, drums and electric guitar join Marling’s voice as she deals with life’s demons.
And just as suddenly as the intensity builds, she goes back to her slower songs, such as “Night After Night.” The album, however, does a good job at avoiding disjunction. Instead, each transition is seamless.
Another song that picks up on Marling’s momentum is the penultimate song “Sophia.” Like “The Beast,” it starts slowly and softly, layering on instruments and volume until by the end it becomes a country-laced, playfully guitar-driven tune.
The album closes with “All My Rage,” which can best be described as an excellent distillation of Marling’s style. The track, probably the most Celtic and folk-driven of the album, is powered by her acoustic guitar playing.
Her talent with lyrics again shines through with clever use of language and imagery, as she sings, Oh cover me up, I’m pale as night / With a mind so dark and skin so white / Is this the devil having fun? / I’d tip my cap to the raging sun. And if the past tracks were driven by love and remorse, this one is one of progress, moving on from what she has been through.
This is not an album for rocking out in a car or for playing at a club. Instead, it’s one of those albums best reserved for a lonesome drive or a moment of quiet reflection. Marling is one of the few musicians out there who can make every song sound as if she is baring all of her soul. A Creature I Don’t Know might not be the year’s best album, but it is one of the most personal.

Students should watch conduct
I had the pleasure of attending my first college football game (I’m over 50 years old) and we had amazing seats behind ‘SC’s bench.
We were across the aisle from the student section and I was quite surprised by the regular roaring of “Utah sucks,” fueling the stadium. Then the incessant booing when Utah’s team was introduced, even yelling ‘bullsh-t’ repeatedly for unfavorable calls (while season ticket holders’ children sat so nearby) was the common aggression throughout the game.
I get it — fans love their team — and they should be able to cheer any way they wish.
But what I didn’t get was booing the Utah band and gymnasts as they performed during half time.
These kids have worked hard to play their music and master routines.
They prepared and traveled for 12-plus hours for the opportunity to show their “stuff,” only to be booed. When they finished, they were not acknowledged.
It’s unfortunate that common civility and kindness are not displayed at such a prestigious institution.

It’s college football, lady. We get drunk before the game, talk shit to the other team, and boo the refs. If you think Saturday against Utah was bad, you should probably skip the UCLA game. That’s when we’re REALLY going to get out of control.
This is what football fans do. This is America. Get over it.
Students usually do not boo the band. I believe we students make exceptions twice a year: Utah and Stanford. The students were booing the band because the Utah band was persistently rude to the Trojan Marching Band throughout the game, much like Stanford’s band does. The Utah band consistently chose to play right afte the TMB had started a song, and to many students like myself, that was rude. So yes, we booed a band that put many hours into their performance. But respect is only given when respect is deserved, and their band did not do so.
^Exactly. We were booing the Utah band because they kept trying to play over Trojan Band after key USC plays. It’s college football etiquette to defer to the home team’s band when they play a song, and not try to interrupt their playing with your own. This is a custom that almost every school adheres to – with a few notable exceptions (such as the douchetastic Stanford band, and apparently, Utah’s band).  
Utah’s band showed a complete lack of class by drying to drown out the Trojan Band’s music with their own, in our house. They deserved to be booed for their behavior.
Utah is one exception you say..aren’t they new to this league?
I barely heard Utah’s band and is it possible the very sizable( and extremely impressive) Trojan band left little opportunity for them to play? They barely took a break…..
I must say that Trojan band really is phenomenal and a pleasure to hear( and watch)!
You’re right, Alexandra.  Nothing brings out the scumsucking pig in us like a football game.  But try and get the same seats when we play teams we hate (Stanford, Notre Dame, UCLA) and the Utah game will look like a church service by comparison.
It’s college football, Alexandra.  The reason it exists is for students to get drunk and boo the “enemy of the week.”  Any alumnus (or just anyone, for that matter) who brings children to a college football game should know that the child will be subject to hearing some swearing, especially if they’re sitting next to the student section.  Let the students have their fun, it’s not like the people on the field expected anything different, especially Utes who knew they were coming into hostile territory.

The other day I was in class trying to understand what my professor was explaining when something else caught my eye.
A few rows ahead of me, some guy was on his laptop watching a video on the Internet.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
I told myself to ignore it, but a little while later I caught myself trying to follow the football highlights he was watching.
As I was trying my best to suppress the distraction, I heard a new distraction to my left.
The girl sitting near me had begun furiously tapping away on the annoyingly loud buttons on her phone, hiding it under her fold-out desk to avoid detection. People bringing these electronics into the classroom distracted not only themselves but those around them.
The combination of long classes and short attention spans lead students to lose focus on the lessons taught in class.
Searching for a cure for this classroom malady, I realized that two of my classes had already solved the problem. While explicitly forbidding cell phones, professors also set aside short breaks during class to let people take a temporary respite without interrupting class.
This solution leaves students with a way to digitally connect for an allocated amount of time in exchange for their attention in class.
It sounds like poor logic: interrupting class for the sake of not interrupting class. But having those breaks really reduces the secretive under-the-desk-between-the-legs phone use so common in classes that try to enforce a no-cell-phone policy.
Because our generation’s collective attention span is minimal and divided, a good portion of each class cannot go a full two hours without our attention drifting elsewhere.
We should strive to expand the success these few classes have implemented a break system have achieved to a broader portion of the school.
The sheer logistics of allowing a large lecture to orderly leave and re-enter a room in the span of 10 minutes might make it hard to imagine this policy being implemented into every class in the school, but that would be looking at the problem too narrowly.
Giving the privilege of a 10-minute break to those 300 students would not mean every one of them would file out two doors in the back of the classroom and clog up the hallway.
Rather, I think most would stay in their seats to use their phones or talk to those around them, allowing their minds to rest and focus more on what is being taught once class resumes. This renewed focus, in turn, would reduce the use of cell phones as the mind would find less reason to wander.
Ask kids not to use their phones for an entire two-hour class period, and likely a group of them will let their attention wander, which can be distracting to those around them.
But turn that class into two consecutive one-hour class periods and the task becomes more realistic; cut it further into three 40-minute periods and the results would be truly noticeable.
Traditionalists might find these breaks as welcome as a cup of sour milk. Interrupting something inherently important for something as trivial as text messages seems fundamentally disrespectful to scholastic tradition.
Students should be able to control themselves and their attention spans, and failure to do so is at their own peril.
The truth, however, is that interruptions are happening whether anything is done or not.
If distractions were channeled into a controlled period, time would be spent more wisely during class.

On Thursday, Sept. 15, the Los Angeles Dodgers will host their semiannual USC Night, featuring a 7:10 p.m. game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. All fans in attendance will receive a cardinal and gold hat with the Dodgers logo, presented by the USC University Hospital.
All events at the game will be USC-themed, from the complimentary baseball caps to the pre-game shows. As a special event, the Commanding Officer of NROTC Los Angeles Consortium at USC, Marine Colonel Alvah E. Ingersoll III, will be honored as Veteran of the Game.
Many USC alumni groups, such as the USC Alumni Club of West Los Angeles and the Alumni Club of San Gabriel Valley, are holding meet-ups during the event. These alumni clubs purchased blocks of seats in the All-You-Can-Eat Pavilion in right field for their members and families. For around $30, USC alumni can partake in unlimited Dodger Dogs, popcorn, soft drinks, nachos and peanuts.
Los Angeles is favored to win the game itself, as the Pirates have slipped in recent rankings. Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp has had an impressive season so far, and will surely contribute to Thursday night’s game.
The stadium is also hosting a college night for UCLA on Sept. 20.
Tickets to USC Night are still on sale at losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com, ranging from around $10 to upwards of $500. Unfortunately, all alumni group tickets are sold out as of August 31.

From 2006 to 2008, USC outscored its opponents by 15 points per game on average and the Trojans rarely played close games. A few points gained from superior special teams play would likely have not made a major difference in USC’s record.
Beginning in 2009, the Trojans dominance slowed, and they began to play much closer contests. Five of the twelve regular season games were decided by six points or less, and blocking a punt or kick might have had a palpable effect on their record. USC, however, only notched two block kicks and turned in a rather unimpressive performance on special teams.
2006: 4 blocks
2007: 2 blocks
2008: 4 blocks
2009: 2 blocks
2010: 7 blocks
When USC coach Lane Kiffin was hired to replace Pete Carroll in January 2010, he decided to put a major emphasis on special teams and hired guru John Baxter away from Fresno State to serve as associated head coach and special teams coordinator.
In his first season, Baxter’s unit compiled seven blocks, 58 percent of the number it took USC to record in the previous four years. The most concrete example of Baxter’s influence came against Arizona State, when the Trojans won 34-33 after blocking a PAT and returning it for two points.
In 2011, the Trojans have already blocked two kicks in two contests, and both had important consequences. Against Minnesota, USC narrowly escaped 19-17. Although the kick USC blocked was a long, low percentage attempt, it prevented the kicker from sneaking one through the uprights and giving the Golden Gophers a crucial three points.
Most importantly, blocked kicks saved the day against Utah in the first ever Pac-12 football game. The Utes had a chance to send the matchup in to overtime with all of the momentum by making a field goal, but junior left tackle Matt Kalil blocked it with his forearm and sophomore cornerback Torin Harris was able to scoop it up for six to seal the victory.

There are a number of eating options between campus and The Row, especially for greasy fast food and sugary drinks. Among those choices is Cup O’ Joy, located at 3016 S Figueroa St., which offers a number of tasty and affordable choices in both of these realms.

Popular favorites like jasmine milk tea and standard fruit flavored smoothies are offered. More uncommon (and arguably tastier) flavors such as Lychee iced tea are available as well. Most drinks can be ordered with boba, which during all of my visits was prepared quite well.
The food is just as good. A particularly tasty choice is the popcorn chicken, which comes in either a “snack portion” or in a meal combo option.
Other choices include minced pork, steamed vegetables and rice. If healthiness is your top concern, Cup O’ Joy might not be the best best. Most dishes are fried and nearly all drinks are very sugary.
Options are clearly visible on the menu and napkins, straws and other conveniences are easily accessible, but I did not experience exceptionally friendly service during my two visits.
Cup O’ Joy is well lit by large windows and feels clean. The interior is not without personal touches; accompanying the security camera in the upper left corner is a sign reading “Big Boba is Watching.”
Parking too always seems to be available on the premise. Cup O’ Joy accepts all standard methods of payment, though a $0.30 surcharge is applied to credit card purchases under $10, so it might be wise to bring a very big appetite or a few friends if this is your preferred method of payment.

Curry House in Little Tokyo is the place to go for delicious, authentic Japanese curry for a good price and a filling meal. Curry House also provides customers with the satisfaction of a wide range of dishes they can mix and match.
In most of the dishes, Curry House uses its main Japanese curry as a base. Customers can choose different ingredients or meats that go in their curry and other sides they can eat it with.
The main curry is packed with flavor, savory enough to have your mouth watering, but mild enough to be more delectable than Indian curry, which includes a lot of coconut milk. With this Japanese curry, a customer can choose from a scale of spiciness to match his or her tastes.
In addition, customers can choose to order the curry traditionally with stewed beef in the curry with a side of rice on the side or try one of their katsu curry dishes. A katsu dish is a combination of rice, curry and a choice of meat lightly breaded and then fried.
A popular katsu dish at Curry House that many customers frequently order is the katsu chicken. The chicken is soft and tender and creates a perfect combination with the slightly crunchy exterior. A customer can also choose to add extras on his or curry such as cheese, fried eggs, onion rings and other delectables.
All in all, I give Curry House eight out of 10 for its great ambiance and scrumptious curry.

His music is undeniably creative. His sounds are made for the dance floor. College students love him. And now, it seems almost everyone in the record business wants to work with him.
Steve Aoki, beat master extraordinaire, has announced that a star-studded array of celebrities will be working with him on his new album, “Wonderland.”
Rivers Cuomo, will.i.am, Travis Barker and LMFAO are just some of the names associated with the album; Cuomo performed with Aoki at the recent IDentity Festival at the Hollywood Palladium. The duo performed Aoki’s new single, “Earthquakey People,” to be released formally in October.
Information concerning the will.i.am collaboration, “Danger,” has also hit the net. The song is supposed to be a follow up to Aoki’s and will.i.am’s previous collaborative effort, “I’m In The House.” Aoki told Rolling Stone working with will.i.am allows his records to generate mass appeal, since basically everything that will.i.am touches turns to Top 40 gold.
So what do these collaborations mean for one of USC’s most beloved DJs? Bringing in a hoard of mainstream artists, especially the likes of LMFAO, could do wonders for improving Aoki’s audience, but what will happen to the music?
As much as Aoki crafts hedonistic dance floor grooves, LMFAO could suck any creativity, artistry and meaningful music out of Aoki’s sound. Let’s face it, “Party Rock Anthem” is a great party tune, but not much else.
As Aoki is preparing to release his new album, which he is billing as a collection of singles, the collegiate world needs to take a few things into consideration. He has worked with will.i.am before, so we can expect a quality track from the two. Rivers Cuomo is an expert songwriter, and it will be interesting to see how Cuomo and Aoki mix the club and pop sounds together.
Barker and Aoki have an incredible track record already, so any work done by the two is sure to be fantastic. But, this LMFAO business — there might be trouble brewing on the horizon.

Daily Trojan: After playing in your first college game, what adjustments do you think you need to make to be successful this year?
Marqise Lee: Better blocking skills. I am too low and need to pick it up.
DT: What do you think are your main strengths as a wide receiver?
Lee: My ability to go up and get the ball. I can catch it when it’s thrown anywhere, which you have to be able to do in my position.
DT: How do you think USC wide receivers coach Ted Gilmore has improved your game?
Lee: He has been really helpful in improving the wide receivers. He puts emphasis on making sure we know our assignments. I now know exactly what routes to run and how to run them. He helps us moderate the defense and know our blocks.
DT: What NFL player would you say your game most resembles?
Lee: I don’t know. I don’t really watch professional football to be honest.
DT: What is one thing most people do not know about you?
Lee: I’m great at ballroom dancing.
What wonderful insight into the mind of marquise lee!!!

Week one of the NFL season saw many former Trojans in action.
Here’s a recap of how they fared in their 2011 debuts.
Here’s a list of players that were either inactive or compiled no/minimal statistics:
Completely agree with Bobby. How could you not feature Joe McKnight’s awesome play that set his team up for the win?
Also, you didn’t mention Kansas City WR Keary Colbert, who had his first two catches in the league in over two years. Much like, Seattle’s Mike Williams, Colbert was out of the league for multiple years, but has made it back.
Joe McKnight had probably the biggest play of them all, blocking the punt to win the game for the Jets
Really liked this accounting of USC alums in pro football. Please do again weekly.
Maybe you could add coaches and asst
 coaches into the mix?
