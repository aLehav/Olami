Education overtook health care as the primary spending destination for California’s foundations between 1999 and 2009, according to a report recently released by the Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. Philanthropy Center Director and report co-author James Ferris attributes this reversal to the conversion of health care organizations in the 1990s from non-profit to for-profit.
“Education is the top priority of the nation in general, and California was in an unusual situation,” Ferris said. “There haven’t been new big health foundations created in the last 10 years, so their impact has diminished over time.”
The state’s total philanthropic donations also increased from $2.8 billion to $6 billion, a 55 percent increase that outpaced the rest of the nation, which has seen a 52.5 percent increase, the report said.
Chris Yates, the associate senior vice president for Major and Planned Gifts in USC’s Office of Advancement, said the decline in education funding from the state of California might have contributed to the growth in funding from foundations.
“Universities, over time, have become more aware of the fact that foundations have been increasing in size and there’s more money out there,” Yates said. “In turn, universities’ approaches to foundations have been more sophisticated, and there have been more resources put into efforts to reach out to and build relations with foundations.”
The report’s list of “100 Largest California Foundations by Assets, 2009” includes many foundations who have donated to USC, such as the Annenberg Foundation at No. 8 and the W.M. Keck Foundation at No. 13.
The reliance on foundation’s gifts likely means more of the university and individual school’s resources are going toward asking for donations, Yates said.
“Typically, gifts from foundations make up a quarter to a third of what USC raises every year,” Yates said. “I suspect that the amount of resources devoted toward maintaining relations with foundations has increased over time both at the central and specific school levels.”
Yates said the university is generally responsible for coming to foundations with requests.
Yates said. “We propose a certain amount to promote a certain project or purpose. We constantly report back to the foundations about our progress based on the objectives we’ve laid out,” Yates said.
The structure of California’s foundation sector has remained largely constant, the report said. Fourteen foundations hold 46 percent of all foundation assets and account for 30 percent of total giving and private independent foundations dominate the landscape.
Though a few large foundations lead California’s philanthropic sector, community foundations play a larger role in California than they do on a national level. There are more foundations with assets of less than $1 million and their share of total giving in the state went up from 6 percent to 11 percent between 1999 and 2009.
The rate of foundation’s growth, however, has been slower, especially during the two economic recessions between 1999 and 2009, the one triggered by the dot-com bubble burst in 2001 and the Great Recession triggered by the housing bubble in 2007. Though the number of foundations in California experienced a 71 percent increase from 4,208 to 7,184, assets adjusted for inflation were largely unaffected.
“The value of foundation endowments have gone up and down with the market,” Ferris said. “In the decade before [1999 to 2009], there was tremendous growth. During the last 10 years, there’s been a plateau; giving has increased but the asset base of the foundations has stayed relatively constant.”
The report said the increase in foundations will continue, and there will be more small foundations to allow for personal giving by living donors.
“There’s not going to be a big surge in the growth of assets of foundations that we saw in the ’90s,” Ferris said. “But foundations will try to have a greater impact. Instead of through giving, they’re going to develop and resort to other strategies beyond grant dollars to make an impact.”
Foundations are legally required to donate at least 5 percent of their endowment each year, but Ferris said foundations vary in how they choose where the money goes.
“They are governed by boards,” Ferris said. “They set overall policy goals and a mission, and that’s what determines how they actually operate.”
Yates said foundations are likely to continue playing a large role in the state, and for USC.
“California is blessed to have a really vibrant and vigorous community of foundations. We have all types of foundations,” Yates said. “The report shows a very encouraging trend within the state.”

Crimes against a person
At 2:05 A.M. on March  4, DPS officers responded to a security guard who was detaining an intoxicated student who kicked him in the shoulder while attempting to climb the scaffolding on a stage during a party at the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity.  The student refused to give a statement and was released after the security guard declined criminal prosecution of the matter.
At 12:15 a.m. on March 4, DPS officers responded to a location to question a student and a bouncer who were involved in an altercation.  The bouncer said the student was intoxicated and punched him in the face after being denied entry to the club, then he responded by punching the student in the face.  Neither the student nor the bouncer desired criminal prosecution of the matter.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 5:43 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers detained a suspect for drinking in public at 32nd and Flower streets. Investigation and a check of his name revealed an outstanding warrant.  The suspect was then arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.

Nationally, almost one-third of undergraduate college students change schools before earning a degree, according a report released by the National Student Clearinghouse.
The study found that 19.6 percent of undergraduate students transfer out of private-for-profit, four-year universities at some point in their college career. Two-year public institutions were the most frequent transfer destinations for these students. Most students that transfer do so after their second year in college.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
The report concludes that community colleges play a significant role in a student’s college career, including serving students coming from four-year universities such as USC.
Kirk Brennan, director of undergraduate admission, said USC has strong ties with California Community Colleges. He contends, however, that community colleges are sending students to USC, not the other way around.
“Most of our transfer students come from California Community Colleges,” Brennan said. “Statewide, we have a two-year student plan that is well-known for helping students obtain a four-year degree. We’ve adopted an almost-public approach.”
Eduardo Iniguez, a junior majoring in business administration, followed this plan when he transferred to USC from Cerritos College in Norwalk, Calif., in 2011.
“I didn’t have a choice [to come to USC freshman year] because I did really bad in high school,” Iniguez said. “I did two-and-a-half years at Cerritos College because I didn’t have the sufficient credits to transfer to USC.”
Iniguez said the USC transfer application process was easy and the university was supportive throughout the process.
“I actually really liked USC’s application process,” Iniguez said. “Compared to other schools, it was the easiest and I actually felt that USC cared about me as a person rather than just asking me the robotic questions that other universities asked.”
In 2011, 9,742 students applied for transfer admission to the university. Of these students, 2,524 were offered admission and 1,434 students enrolled, Brennan said.
Though Brennan could not comment on the transfer rate out of USC, he said the university’s retention rate is very high.
“We accept a lot of transfers, and, in California, we know that accepting transfers is a more established tradition,” Brennan said. “This place continues to exceed expectations, we continue to do great things — we bring in great students and retain great faculty.”
Kim Leoffler, a freshman majoring in broadcast journalism, said that she would not consider leaving USC to pursue a two-year degree.
“I am serious about getting a well-rounded education and I don’t think that can be accomplished in less than four years,” Leoffler said.
Lauren Bergold, a junior transfer student majoring in business administration, said her decision to transfer to USC from the University of San Francisco was influenced by the USC’s academics, location and reputation.
“I knew earning a [bachelor’s of science] in business administration at USC would be a dream come true. Also, I love that USC is located in Los Angeles because I love Southern California and all it has to offer,” Bergold said.
As a lowly community college transfer, I wouldn’t do it all over again if given the choice. My first night here, I naively thought that I could attend here like a commuter school. Boy was I wrong. I missed the Metro bus to go back home; I slept on the Leavey bench downstairs by the computers that night. The next morning I was groggy and didn’t want to go to classes. I ended up getting bad grades my first semester because I didn’t know how the curving system or way to study was like…SC’s a great school, but definitely not for jr. college transfers. You come here excited; happy that you’re attending the biggest university in the Los Angeles area, or least a rival to the other one; the football season is larger than life…and then you’ll see that you don’t belong if you didn’t come in as a freshman.
I love SC, it’s an awesome school, but I don’t feel like I’m part of the Trojan family. It ain’t for those who can’t afford it, nor is it for those who transfer in. 
You can fight on, but I’ll take a different path.

For the third time in her career, senior guard Briana Gilbreath was named the Pac-12 Co-Defensive Player of the Year, as the leader of USC’s defensive efforts this season.
Getting defensive · Senior guard Briana Gilbreath has been the conference defensive player of the year the past three seasons. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Pac-12 announced the decisions after a panel of Pac-12 women’s basketball media members voted on the honors to recognize individual efforts this season.
Gilbreath earned Defensive Player of the Year in 2010, shared the award in 2011, and shares the award this year with senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike of Stanford, who was also named the Pac-12 Player of the Year.
Gilbreath leads the Women of Troy averaging 1.5 blocks, 1.5 steals and 5.2 defensive rebounds a game, while co-leading the offensive end with an average of 12.1 points per game and 13 double-doubles on the year.
By helping USC limit its opponents to 37 percent shooting from the field this season, Gilbreath and the team now stand at third place in the conference with a first round bye in the upcoming Pac-12 tournament.
She has also made her name among the USC all-time greats as sixth in steals, fourth in blocks and eighth in rebounds in school history.
The conference office also announced Gilbreath’s inclusion in the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team and the All-Pac-12 Team for the third consecutive year.
Alongside Gilbreath, fellow senior guard Ashley Corral notched her third straight All-Pac-12 Team award.
Corral ranks first in the conference for 3-point field goals made this season and holds the USC record in 3-pointers. She also leads the Women of Troy with 3.3 assists a game and ranks fourth all-time in USC history.

Ladies and gentlemen, the wait is almost over. Spring football practice is now in session.
Undoubtedly, this offseason leading up to the Sept. 1 opener at the Coliseum is the most anticipated since the Trojan’s run for consecutive national championships in 2003 and 2004.
Since it was announced that the pair of superb sevens, junior quarterback Matt Barkley and junior safety T.J. McDonald, would be staying for their senior seasons, Trojans cannot help but be excited for what lies ahead in 2012.
During the 2011 season, significant improvement was made from the previous year. Last year’s performance indicated that the USC program under Kiffin has much to prove and great potential for the upcoming seasons. As USC begins preparations for 2012, the Trojans need to capitalize on this off-season and the opportunities of spring and fall practices.
Learning from last year:
In 2011, USC was plagued with two issues that, at times, hindered performance. USC had young and inexperienced players that were forced into crucial situations. Players that were just becoming acquainted with the offensive and defensive schemes were thrown into big game situations.
At the beginning of the season, it was evident that the close games were because of a lack of confidence rather than a lack of talent. Hence, the lack of confidence became an Achilles’ heel.
During the second half of the season, the Trojans were plagued with injuries, often forcing players to stray from the game strategy that had been ingrained into them at the beginning of the season.
Finishing the season with 10 wins and two losses, including a triple-overtime against Stanford, it is undeniable that USC has its confidence back. Most importantly, USC needs to carry the momentum from last season into spring practices.
Don’t get caught up in the hype:
Early predictions anticipate USC will be playing in, and possibly winning, the national championship. Most agree that it is a dream come true to have championship hopes after a two-year bowl ban.
The team, however, needs to stay grounded. Setting expectations too high might lead to complacency and a notion of entitlement.
Yes, USC has finally been released from its prison sentence, allowing the Trojans to potentially compete for the national championship, but don’t expect a trip to Miami just yet.
Considering what is known about the 2012 roster, it is easy to assume that the Trojans will be “bowling” in January.
But don’t put too much pressure on the team by ranking them No. 1 or 2 so soon Remember the saying, “It’s not about how you start, but how you finish,” — that is exactly how the Bowl Championship Series operates.
Learning from the best:
During spring and fall practices, USC needs to take advantage of having veteran leaders on roster.
Players like Barkley and McDonald know what works and what is best for the team on the offensive or defensive side of the ball.
Last season, several players noted that they developed their own skills by learning from older and wiser players.
This is the time to work on skills and perfecting strategy. By cultivating this mentor relationship, players will be set for this upcoming season and everyone will be ready to accept any challenge thrown at them.
The roster has taken a huge cut because of scholarship reductions.
Using the talents of each player to the fullest extent will be the biggest asset for USC, especially in dire situations.
Great opportunity lies ahead for the Trojans in 2012. Returning talent and few departures have placed USC in a great position to regain its dominance within the college football arena.
Only time will tell if the fate of the USC football program. Without a doubt, proper preparations need to be made now to prime the Trojans for “bowling” in the New Year.

If someone were to ask the average USC student to rank the university’s top-five fastest growing club sports teams, the chances that USC women’s ice hockey would make the cut are astronomically small. Most students do not know that USC has a men’s hockey team, let alone a women’s squad.
Hidden gem · USC’s women’s hockey team has no in-state collegiate rivals and travels all over the country to play. The team, however, has managed to double in size since 2008, and the squad practices three days a week. - Photo courtesy of USC women’s ice hockey club
But the USC women’s ice hockey club is alive and well, shattering the old stereotype that hockey is exclusively a male sport.
Founded in 2001, the club began as a fledgling organization consisting of eight to 10 students who occasionally played pick-up games at a nearby rink. Now, the organization boasts a roster of 26 students. The club, a member of USA Hockey, went undefeated last season before taking third place in its division in a tournament in Vancouver.
The main challenge is finding enough teams to beat. The USC women’s ice hockey club is the only college women’s ice hockey club in California and one of the only college women’s hockey clubs west of the Mississippi River.
“Our biggest issue is exposing these girls to enough competition so they can play more games under pressure,” said Jerry Toy, the club’s head coach since 2008.
“We do our best with what’s within our means and we’ve grown tremendously,” he said.
The club had 12 players on the roster in 2008 with many of them considering practices optional, only attending those that were most convenient, according to Toy.
“Now we’ve got 26 extremely dedicated girls who fully participate,” Toy said. “I love to coach them because they listen, are willing to take risks and they push themselves.”
Women’s ice hockey is slightly different than men’s in that there is no “checking” or full body contact. As a result, women’s hockey games feature fundamentals, skills and fewer injuries.
Liz Bitzer, the team’s president, said one of the main obstacles that keeps girls off the ice is a fear of getting injured. According to Bitzer, however, injuries on the ice are rare.
“We usually don’t have any issues with injuries on the ice,” said Bitzer, a sophomore majoring in Spanish. “When we do have any injuries, it’s usually because the person is not paying attention or gets injured doing something completely unrelated to hockey.”
The team’s captain, Cayley Tullman, tore her anterior cruciate ligament while snowboarding.
“Most injuries occur when girls don’t know the fundamentals of falling,” Tullman said, a senior majoring in Spanish and international relations.
Tullman said the most common injuries are collarbone breaks and concussions, but according to Toy, the club recently purchased stronger helmets to better protect players.
“There is no [such] thing as a concussion-proof helmet,” Toy said.  “But this keeps girls safer on the ice.”
Though the team is competitive and faces the premier women’s hockey teams in California, the club welcomes all members, regardless of skill level.
Chandler Baker, a sophomore majoring in computer science, said she joined the club with no hockey experience.
Her first challenge was learning to skate.
“I was super involved with sports back in high school, but when I got to college, I cut back and I needed to fill the void,” Baker said, now a forward on the hockey team.
Baker said exercise is key to relieving her stress, but it’s one thing to work out and another to play an organized sport.
“There is no comparison between running on a treadmill at the Lyon Center and practicing every week on the ice with your best friends,” she said.
The club practices three days a week at the Paramount Iceland, but only one hour at a time because of budget constraints.
Bitzer said an hour of ice time costs $300, but the team only charges each player $300 per semester.
“Playing hockey is very expensive, but we don’t want financial issues to discourage anyone from joining the club,” Bitzer said.
The club receives most of its funding from private donations, the USC Recreational Club Council and from several fundraisers featuring T-shirts, letter-writing campaigns and an invite on ice.
As a result, club membership is much more affordable, allowing for greater diversity.
“We have girls from the East Coast, West Coast, girls of different ages, majors and different personalities,” Tullman said.  “This club opened doors for me and allowed me to make meaningful friendships with many different kinds of girls.”
Bitzer and Tullman said the team has become more competitive through the years, but wins and losses are only a small component of what USC women’s ice hockey is all about.
“This club provides a small group of girls the enormous resource of a cohesive Trojan Family,” Bitzer said.  “Everyone genuinely cares about each other, and we’re all here for one another, on and off the ice.”

After a trip to one of college baseball’s toughest places to play, No. 21 USC baseball returns home with a better sense of where the team is headed this season.
Swinging away · Senior outfielder Sean Spear and USC are hitting .304 as a team this year. The Trojans have won eight of their first 11 games. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans began the year 7-0 but now sit at 8-3 after falling twice to the University of North Carolina over the weekend. USC, however,  played the Tar Heels dead even in the final two games of the series, and salvaged the final game 5-2 thanks to the best start of freshman Stephen Tarpley’s young collegiate career.
“Any time you beat a team that’s in the top of the ranks like North Carolina is, it helps your confidence,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “However, we went into that series expecting to win it, not just to take one game. I told the guys on Saturday, ‘We’re not here to compete. We’re here to win.’”
Now the Trojans are back at the friendly confines of Dedeaux Field to take on a stout Cal State Fullerton team that has won seven straight to begin the year 9-3.
The Titans’ streak is due in most part to the recent success of their pitching staff. During its seven-game run, Fullerton has only given up more than three runs once, and have allowed only six runs over its last five games. The combined score during the streak is Cal State Fullerton 43, opponents 18.
“They’re always really good,” Cruz said of the Titans. “There’s no surprise that they’re doing what they’re doing. We’re going to be up against an offense that does a really nice job, and then of course their pitching has been excellent, too.”
Amid his praise for Fullerton, Cruz also noted that his team will be prepared.
“What we’re going to do — what we’ve got to do — to be successful is to play catch,” Cruz said. “We’ve been playing pretty well defensively and I think that’ll continue as long as we’re sharp. I know [Fullerton] will be tough, so we’ve got to make sure we catch the ball.”
USC’s pitching hasn’t exactly been slumping, either. After a hiccup from Tarpley and senior pitchers Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount combined to hold the Tar Heels to three earned runs in 13 2/3 innings, with 14 strikeouts and five walks.
Add in the fact that USC has given up more than three runs just three times all year, and the pitching staff starts to resemble a strength that the Trojans should be able to rely on for the rest of the season.
“They can get better,” Cruz said. “But we’ve gotten some really nice outings from Mount. Tarpley has thrown a few too many balls at times, but he’s been impressive, too.”
Senior pitcher Brandon Garcia, the de facto fourth starter for USC, will likely get his third start of the season against Fullerton, looking to rebound from a four-inning outing against Pepperdine last Tuesday.
“Brandon can obviously throw better than he did last week,” Cruz said. “He didn’t throw as many strikes as we wanted, and because of that, he got in trouble. If he keeps it in the strike zone, he’ll be fine.”
Garcia will likely be up against the Titans’ Koby Gauna, who is coming off a tidy five-inning, one-run effort against Loyola MarymountUniversity.
First pitch Tuesday night is at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Imagine all the bad little girls in America staging a mass prison break from every time-out zone and wall-facing chair in which they were being held. Now imagine, using the age progression technology of your mind, those same naughty tykettes all grown up, and you’ll have a pretty good idea of what constitutes a sizable slice of TV programming today.
2012 seems poised to go down as the year of the “bad girl.” That statement could have been fairly made about any number of the most recent seasons of television, but it seems that TV bad girls’ day in the sun somehow ran into day two, and then three, and so on.

At different ages and in all her numerous incarnations — the unhinged housewife, the catty Christian, the boozy barmaid, the salacious socialite — the bad girl has found favor among viewing audiences. She wouldn’t be nearly as ubiquitous if she weren’t drawing in ratings.
The success of Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise can be safely chalked up to the appeal of messes in dresses, and the runaway popularity of MTV’s Jersey Shore almost certainly stems from audiences’ morbid fascinations with the train wrecks populating the storied coastline. VH1 was unabashed in its exploitation of the trend, airing such instant classics as Flavor of Love and the timeless Tiffany Pollard star vehicle I Love New York. Even NBC got in on the action with Are You There, Chelsea?, based on crass female comic Chelsea Handler’s heavy-drinking ’20s.
But no network — broadcast, cable or otherwise — is showcasing girls behaving badly more prominently than ABC. The legacy network is currently in the middle of the debut season of Suburgatory, which makes repeated reference to every high school girl’s perennial fount of agony — other high school girls. It’s also preparing for an April launch of Don’t Trust The B-tch in Apt. 23, starring Kristen Ritter as the titular b-word.
Most notable for ABC, however, are the network’s high profile lineup additions that happened last Sunday and the high profile exit that is planned for approximately seven weeks down the line.
As ABC’s flagship Sunday night program Desperate Housewives prepares to let the curtain fall on its eighth and final season, the network already has another show — the enigmatically titled and decidedly familiar-feeling GCB — waiting in the wings to hopefully draft off Desperate Housewives’ overlapping fan base. GCB, which is hinted at standing for “Good Christian B-tches,” centers on a cutthroat clique of spurned religious women in Dallas who are out to make life hell for the newly returned queen bee of their high school years.
This latest batch of backstabbers might have Texas twangs, cowboy hats and rhinestone rosaries, but with respect to their wealth, surgically achieved looks and overwhelming cattiness, there’s little to distinguish GCB’s Dallas women from the ladies of Wisteria Lane.
Considering a recent profusion of TV spots shamelessly playing up the similarities between the two shows, coupled with the fact that Desperate Housewives is currently serving as GCB’s 9 o’clock lead-in, ABC’s clear goal is for a 100 percent migration of Desperate Housewives’ audience to GCB, once the former takes its well-deserved bow later this spring.
Again, viewers wouldn’t be bombarded with these representations of women if the arrows were consistently missing their mark. The abundance of bad girls on the air suggests there’s almost a built-in audience for this type of character. But trying to pin down the cause of the fascination is an exercise in speculation.
Intuitively, it seems that at least part of the attraction to the bad girl character is the appeal of the familiar. Everyone has had a “frenemy” at some point in school or the professional world.
And the independent woman has to be at least as common as the frenemy, if not more so. In a social environment where self-righteous talking heads are too quick to appoint themselves as the moral compasses of society in general, notions of independence and autonomy — specifically as applied to women — are inextricably bound to ideas of free-wheeling, binge-drinking, sexually uninhibited chasers of gratification.
Though the likes of Rush Limbaugh might feel qualified to pass public judgment on others’ personal decisions, it’s likely that a significant portion of the appeal of the “bad behavior,” so frequently exhibited by female characters on television, has to do with viewers craving at least a vicarious taste of the thrill of the unbridled autonomy they see every week on the small screen.
Despite describing them as bad girls, it’s obvious these characters engage in just as many behaviors that are nothing to be ashamed of. Shameless’ Fiona Gallagher (Emmy Rossum) dabbles in streetwise hustling to provide for her brood of younger siblings. Cricket Caruth-Reilly (Miriam Shor) on GCB is a successful businesswoman and CEO. Even Laura Prepon, as young Chelsea Handler, should be applauded for asserting herself sexually and prioritizing her own wants and needs.
As long as there are strong women in the world, there need to be strong women on the screen. It might be easier to reduce them as ruthlessly ambitious or loosely principled, but the recent spate of caricatures instead of characters strongly suggests that TV needs to update its idea of what an independent woman really looks and acts like.

In the modern world of live entertainment, Jane Austen UnScripted is a true gem. Skillfully executed by Impro Theatre company, the play is completely improvised and powered by the viewers’ suggestions. The audience’s involvement gives the performance a special meaning because every show is unque.
Spontaneity · The Impro Theater’s performance of Jane Austen UnScripted impresses with its comedic and dramatic use of improv. - Photo courtesy of Alison Incontanti
Though the content of each performance differs every night, the style of each performance is the same. Prior to the performance, Impro Theatre actors dedicated themselves to the study of English novelist Jane Austen’s storytelling techniques and characters. They educated themselves in the culture of the era of her novels and made sure to dress and speak in the style of Austen’s time period.
The play could not be the hit that it is without the skill of its cast. Eleven of Impro Theatre’s members perform in the inventive show, all with their own style of improvisation.  With no time to prepare back story or study their character, it is delightful to witness the ease in which these actors operate.
Quick on the draw, each member of the cast deals with verbal slip-ups with such adept comedic timing that it leaves the audience laughing, not cringing. This is not awkward improv in the least; if anything, the rare out-of-character stumbles make the whole experience all the more charming.
And the play isn’t just restricted to comedy; the cast has the ability to turn audience suggestion into everything from a family drama to a love story. It’s important to note that this ability isn’t always the case with improv. There’s great skill in keeping an audience laughing, but there’s even greater skill in keeping the audience emotionally involved in the story.
All cast members have their own way of exaggerating their expressions, and though all are talented and fun to watch, one cast member in particular, Dan O’Connor, stands out. His hilarious facial expressions allow him to communicate his character’s emotions without words, and his cast members play off of him well.
Also, pay close attention to Stephen Kearin, a delightful redhead with notably quirky hair. Kearin is a true example of how acting is not just verbal: Though he is perhaps one of the quietest actors onstage, Kearin plays one of the grandest roles. It is not easy to play a quiet role while still maintaining a lasting presence onstage, but Kearin does so in such an effortless manner that one can’t help but connect with the performance. Kearin is also helped by Paul Rogan, an actor who has a great gift in portraying grandiose narcissism. The two, contrasting in their quiet and boisterous natures, create quite the amusing pair.
The location of the play certainly set the tone for the night as well. There is something grand about spending an evening at the theater, and the Pasadena Playhouse does not disappoint in its aesthetic experience. The trickling fountain in the courtyard and open floor plan ushers one away from the buzz of Downtown Pasadena and into the tranquil magic of the stage, seemingly cleansing one’s cultural palate to ready them for a night of imaginative entertainment.
The play is housed in the Playhouse’s Carrie Hamilton Theatre, which is minimally decorated in such a way that the actors remain the most interesting thing onstage. With only two chairs, a couch and a rug, the center stage leaves a lot of room open for the cast to create the play’s world. The setting also allows audience members to use their imaginations to picture their ideal backdrop for the story. The small venue allows for a comfortable, intimate experience. The whole production feels raw and personal and leaves a lasting impression.
The agile humor of Jane Austen UnScripted is a form of entertainment that is incomparable to that of a movie. The play is genuinely involving: As an audience member one is not a stranger watching from a distance, but a member of the play itself.  That live-action feeling simply cannot be matched by many other forms of entertainment, and the show’s excellent execution takes improv theater to a new level.
Jane Austen UnScripted will be performed in the Carrie Hamilton Theatre at the Pasadena Playhouse through April 1. Shows are scheduled on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 4 p.m. General admission is $25, and student and senior tickets are $20.

On the opening track of Black Radio, recently released by the Robert Glasper Experiment, hip-hop artist Shafiq Husayn entreats listeners to use the following album as therapy.

“Now as we prepare for our liftoff, you’ll need only two things to direct your course: your ears and your soul. I bring to you the Robert Glasper Experiment: experimentation for meditation,” Husayn bellows.
What the listener soon realizes, however, is that Husayn’s petition is unnecessary because Glasper’s Black Radio emotional remedies speak for themselves.
In a music review, it is common practice to frame the boundaries within which a group establishes its melodic prowess, but that format doesn’t fit the Robert Glasper Experiment. The group is both the exception and the new standard.
In fact, trying to pigeonhole the Robert Glasper Experiment into an established musical genre is akin to trying to fit the clichéd square peg into the round hole. Critics stumble over aspects of various genres and usually end up characterizing the Experiment’s style as a fusion of jazz, hip-hop and rhythm and blues. Though the Experiment’s sound certainly shows off these elements, it’s misleading to view the group’s music as a pastiche of influences. Instead, the group’s sound is a brilliant synthesis that pushes the frontier of musical progression.
The Robert Glasper Experiment is composed of Robert Glasper on keys, Casey Benjamin on saxophone, Derrick Hodge on bass and Chris Dave on drums. Though the band is well-defined by this core four, Glasper enlists the help of an elite cast of featured artists to fill out the group’s sound and make Black Radio feel like a family reunion. Vocals are provided by past collaborators and influences of the Experiment, including Bilal Oliver, Lupe Fiasco, Ledisi, Musiq Soulchild, Meshell Ndegeocello and Mos Def.
Track four on Black Radio, “Always Shine,” features longtime Experiment collaborator Bilal Oliver singing hooks for three verses of Lupe Fiasco’s wily rhymes. Fiasco feels at home over Glasper’s rolling piano chords and keeps a moderate tempo, all with confidence.
And the title track, “Black Radio,” feels built for Mos Def before the vocals come in.  Glasper expertly constructs a swift current of drum and bass for Mos Def to freestyle his way through. Here, Mos Def hits with his signature spiritual, staccato flow and range of tones. A short afterword follows the song, with Glasper and crew jamming as Mos Def whistles.
Despite the Experiment’s emphasis on intricate original tunes, the band intentionally dives into vastly different styles with covers of David Bowie’s “Letter to Hermione,” Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” Sade’s “Cherish the Day” and the Afro-Cuban standard “Afro Blue.”
Lalah Hathaway transforms Sade’s “Cherish the Day” from a pensive slow jam into a slice of self-assurance encouraged by a moving drum beat. Glasper’s rendition of Bowie’s “Letter to Hermione” is also notable: Here, guest singer Bilal Oliver croons the humble sentiments of an unrequited love, in the process recapturing Bowie’s tender vocal qualities.
Perhaps the most ambitious track on the album is the Experiment’s cover of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Modulating vocals replace Kurt Cobain’s pining rasp to imbue the song with a sense of robotic detachment.
Glasper grabs hold of the original and folds it into a jazzy exploration complete with earthy bongos on one end and futuristic filtered vocals on the other, giving the track his stamp of originality. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” is further evidence of the Experiment’s ability to venture out into the broader world of music and return home with the finest aspects of every genre.
The album cover for Black Radio is an image of Glasper that’s sliced into hundreds of pieces and recast into something of a modern-day Janus. Discernible in the center of the image is Glasper supporting the weight of thought with his hand as he glances up. Surrounding his face are cut-ups of eyes, mouths and noses facing in all directions.
If an album cover can be symbolic as an artist’s perspective of his or her place in music, Glasper aptly illustrates the accomplishments of Black Radio by choosing to represent his band with a human head that seems to be simultaneously together and disjointed.

Tumblr, an online blogging community, announced last week that it will implement a new policy against blogs that promote self-harm, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Since Tumblr’s launch five years ago, it has encouraged users from all walks of life to share their stories. This freedom, however, has allowed several blogs to emphasize negative material that can be detrimental to readers’ perceptions and self-esteem. The trending topic of “thinspiration” has grown increasingly popular on Tumblr.
On thinspiration blogs, users glorify dangerously thin girls, share their experiences with eating disorders and confess their harmful habits.
The proposed plan of action is to monitor tags and prohibit posts that encourage self-mutilation, anorexia, bulimia and suicidal thoughts and to provide bloggers with links to hotlines or treatment websites.
By putting forth this policy, Tumblr has made a bold and necessary move.
Any frequent user of Tumblr has encountered thinspiration posts in some form or another. As a Tumblr user, I at times feel barraged with images of “ideal” women.
These types of blogs dominate fashion, photography and beauty threads; often, Tumblr seems like a community centered on pictures of pretty people that reinforce damaging notions of perfectionism.
Such an overbearing presence of thinspiration blogs exposes impressionable teens to a deluge of content that provokes low self-esteem and could lead to unhealthy behaviors or eating disorders.
Our society is already full of images of so-called perfect women and men; Tumblr is making a significant effort to make sure these messages don’t seep into its blogosphere.
Content that promotes eating disorders to such an extent can trigger relapses. Aimee Liu, a staff writer at Ms. Magazine who struggled with an eating disorder for years, said that “perfectionism is common in people with all eating disorders. These traits precede the disorder, and they do not go away when you recover.”
A large constituency of Tumblr bloggers argue that the new policy sweeps self-harm issues under the rug and prevents users from expressing themselves. Tumblr recognizes that simply eliminating these posts is counterproductive.
Instead, by acknowledging self-harm posts and providing users with resources to seek help, Tumblr is encouraging awareness. This awareness will motivate users in need of treatment to seek help, or at least discover sites that offer valuable information about dealing with eating disorders.
Critics of the new policy also argue that blogs promoting self-harm provide a support system to users who are otherwise completely isolated by their disease. Without them, freedom of expression becomes limited and inter-group discussion ceases.
But the new policy seeks to limit this discussion as a means of discouraging glorifying discourse about serious mental diseases. Inhibiting the onslaught of triggering content can make a difference in the lives of many.
The censorship of thinspiration blogs aims to limit posts with implications of self-harm as opposed to the general expressions of niche communities.
The website ultimately has the right to protect the well-being of its users. And it has made a significant stride in creating a positive environment. This policy is only going to increase the standard of content on Tumblr.
It is a daring move, but someone needed to do it.

It seems cruel to me to take away a platform that is, it seems, an outlet for someone who is struggling inside. All of this smacks of “not in front of the children”-type nonsense. That, and something else more troublesome.
Content restrictions will neither protect society — people will get it somewhere else — nor those who are self-harming, which suggests to me that it’s not really that Tumblr cares about its users and any difficulties they may have, but they are scared of a lawsuit one day that says, “The plaintiff’s son/daughter first took note of the behavior when s/he saw it on a Tumblr blog….”

Is “party etiquette” an oxymoron, or a new initiative launched by a college administration? It seems to be both.
The Office of Campus Activities recently out an email containing a set of partying guidelines. Though some of these guidelines are perfectly logical, some are completely unrealistic — such as “Do not allow drinking games” or “Make a manageable guest list and STICK TO IT!”
USC students should certainly be respectful of their neighbors, but the university can help the problem by being more sensible in its expectations of students.
These unreasonable suggestions point to a disconnect between what the university thinks will work and what will work in reality.
We can address off-campus partying by looking at why students party. USC does offer many great events, such as intramural sports or Visions & Voices, but these events usually don’t run at the times parties are occurring — evenings on weekends.  If an organization does run an event at this time, that event is usually a party — thus circling back to the original issue.
For car-less students, rallying friends together for a Zipcar requires a lot more planning than walking to a party, and public transit can seem intimidating to many students.
There is a discount for public transportation passes, but many people don’t know this program exists.  It should be more readily promoted.
What’s more, late-night options for socializing on campus are virtually non-existent. Ground Zero Performance Café could become a hub of late-night activity, but it closes at midnight. Ground Zero should expand its hours to become an option for socializing that doesn’t revolve around partying.  Coffee shops that stay open past midnight are a staple at some other colleges—why shouldn’t USC have one?
Email guidelines aren’t effective. Well-promoted on-campus socializing options would help reduce the number of wild parties and, thus, the number of irritated neighbors.

The Trojans picked up a pair of wins in its weekend home stand versus Hawaii on Friday and Saturday. The Trojans (9-4) swept the first match with scores of 25-22, 25-18 and 25-18 and won in a five-setter with scores of 25-17, 24-26, 25-22, 16-25 and 15-10 on Sunday.
The Trojans’ blocking scheme shined throughout both matches. The Trojans finished the weekend with 31 blocks compared to Hawaii’s 21. The blocking differential gave the Trojans the edge over the course of the weekend where neither team hit above .210.

“We did a good job blocking,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “[Assistant Coach] Jeff Nygaard’s been putting together great scouting reports and blocking schemes and it’s really showed in the last month.”
In Friday’s match, the tough Trojan block created a bevy of problems for the Warriors. Senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick finished the match with eight kills and seven blocks and redshirt sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen led the way with 12 kills earned at a .500 clip.
“They hit a lot of cross-court shots right into where I block,” Shandrick said. “We’ve been expecting it and working on it all week and it’s good that we executed.”
The Warriors committed 15 service errors and 25 hitting errors in Friday’s match, exacerbating the impact of the Trojan block. Although the Trojans’ offensive efficiency was suspect, finishing with just a .195 percentage, the Trojans managed to shut the door on a Hawaii comeback.
In a ceremony after the match, the jerseys of former USC-All Americans Steven Timmons, a three-time Olympic medalist, and Adam Johnson, the 1986 National Player of the Year, were retired in front of 1,500 fans.
Sunday’s match required a shot of energy from the Trojans’ senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli in an uncharacteristically sloppy match. Ciarelli finished with 21 kills earned at a .340 clip.
“Tony did a great job leading,” Ferguson said. “He set the tone during the fifth set and rallied our guys.”
The Warriors received an unexpected boost in the second set. Hawaii looked completely lost in rotations and were penalized twice for procedural errors. Although Hawaii paid for the botched rotations with a couple of points, they began to play more focused and loose volleyball.
“Their botched lineups forced them to just play volleyball and forget the little stuff,” Ferguson said. “They started to tee off from the service line that caused us some trouble passing.”
The Trojans also shuffled their lineup, inserting freshman middle blocker Ben Lam and shuffling redshirt junior and senior outside hitters Jeff Carlson and Steven Mochalski with junior Maddison McKibbin and Jansen in an effort to remedy shaky performances.
Between sloppy play from USC and a surge of inspiration from Hawaii, the Trojans were forced into a tie-breaking fifth set to decide the match.
“We were able to get back to our normal lineup in the fifth set,” Ferguson said. “And we responded well with our backs against the wall.”
The Trojans jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, channeling the dominant play from Friday’s match.
“I said the same thing as I did right before the fifth set at Stanford,” Ciarelli said. “Everyone plays the fifth set with emotion, but it’s really about execution. You can’t let your emotions control you or else you’ll see your lead slip away.”

Sometimes a good story is enough to push a musician into the forefront of attention. Sometimes the story turns out to be more compelling than the music. The life of Willis Earl Beal would be an interesting story by itself, but when told in tandem with the LP he is set to release on XL Records this April, it’s almost impossible to look away.
Beal fell out of a job in Chicago and with encouragement from a movie he once saw, decided to move to Albuquerque with hopes that it would stimulate his growth as an artist. Beal began leaving posters around Albuquerque with hand drawn portraits of himself along with his phone number. He also began leaving CD’s of his music around the city. He was really just looking for some friends, but people began to notice how talented of a musician he was.
Call the number on Beal’s flyer and he’ll sing you a song. Write him a letter and he’ll draw you a picture. This seems an interesting format for garnering attention, but it isn’t as much methodical as it is necessary for Beal. Without a computer and with rudimentary recording equipment Beal’s lack of resources only seem to encourage him more to be inventive.
A story in the Chicago Reader from July of last year cites Beal using a karaoke machine and a Radio Shack microphone to record his tunes. Some special effects were added to his tracks with the aid of a faucet and some plastic bags.
If Beal was down and out a year ago he is now the man everyone wants to meet. His debut LP, Acousmatic Sorcery, is slated for release through the XL imprint “Hot Charity” on April 3.
Head over to Pitchfork to hear three tracks from the upcoming album, “Take Me Away,” “Evenings Kiss,” and “Montony.”
And if you’re feeling spontaneous give him a call (773-295-2135).

After dropping the first two games of a three game set against No. 6 North Carolina over the weekend, the USC baseball team managed to avoid a series sweep with a 5-2 victory over the Tar Heels (8-2) on Sunday.
The Trojans (8-3) fell behind 1-0 in the bottom of the fourth, and looked as they would go quietly in the top of the fifth. But with two outs, senior outfielder Garret Houts singled and stole second.
Junior second baseman Adam Landecker singled him home and advanced to third on a double by senior first baseman Matt Foat. Both scored on a single by senior catcher Kevin Roundtree. Roundtree moved to third on a double by sophomore third baseman Kevin Swick, and both scored on a single by sophomore shortstop James Roberts before the inning finally came to an end.
All told, six straight Trojan hitters reached base, all with two outs, and five players scoring to put USC up 5-1.
“It just clicked,” said USC coach Frank Cruz of the big fifth inning. “We just got the hits.”
Those five runs were more than enough for Trojan starting pitcher Stephen Tarpley. The freshman did not look like one against one of the best teams in college baseball, going six strong innings, allowing two runs on five hits, with just two walks to his seven strikeouts.
“Stephen pitched great,” Cruz said. “He really stepped up and helped us get out with a win.”
On Saturday, USC got another great performance on the mound, but senior Ben Mount’s seven and 2/3 innings of one-run ball were not enough as the Trojan fell 1-0 in an old-fashioned pitcher’s duel. Tar Heel starter Chris Munnelly allowed a leadoff single to the very first hitter of the game, and then did not give up another hit over seven shutout innings.
“Mount threw really, really well,” Cruz said. “It was a great game, but we squandered our best chance to score.”
The chance came in the eighth inning when sophomore outfielder Omar Cotto Lozada singled to start the inning and moved to second on a fielder’s choice. Cotto Lozada advanced to third on a wild pitch. He broke for home on another wild pitch, but was tagged out at the plate. It was one of just two times in the game the Trojans even got a runner into scoring position.
While the Trojans competed on Saturday, they were torn apart Friday 11-1. The Tar Heels scored three in the second off of senior pitcher Andrew Triggs and two more in the third to put USC in a 5-0 hole early. The Trojans got one back in the seventh, but their bullpen was decimated for six runs over the final two innings to put the game completely out of reach.
The Trojans traveled every player on the team to Chapel Hill “as a reward for their hard work in the fall,” according to Cruz. And while USC lost the series, Cruz said he felt his team grew from the experience of the road trip and level of the competition.
“We can take this and grow from it,” Cruz said. “But we can’t look behind at it. We’re always looking ahead.”
Ahead for the Trojans is another tough matchup. USC returns home Tuesday to host No. 15 Cal State Fullerton at six p.m. at Dedeaux Field.
