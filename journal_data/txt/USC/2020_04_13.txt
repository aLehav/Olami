With the coronavirus bringing most religious gatherings to a halt, religious groups at USC have found ways to adapt to the pandemic. Students and staff from USC Hillel, as well as Our Savior Parish and USC Caruso Catholic Center, tailored their celebrations for Passover and Easter this week by providing more virtual activities and spaces for community members to come together online. 
Since the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced the suspension of all Masses starting March 17, Our Savior Parish suspended daily and Sunday Masses until further notice. For Holy Week, which took place April 9 through 12, Our Savior Parish live-streamed Mass via Facebook Live and celebrated Easter Sunday Mass on Zoom. 
“It’s definitely hard not to be able to be there in person and be with the community especially during this very sacred time, but I think that it’s really awesome that we’ve been able to continue to foster a sense of community and celebrate the important holidays in our tradition,” said Katie Pavy, a senior majoring in global health. 
Rosie Shawver, director of campus ministry at the Catholic Center, said the center has had to modify three days of Holy Week typically celebrated with a special mass or service: Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday’s Easter Vigil, which extends into Easter Sunday. While the Easter Vigil normally sees those who have desired to become Catholic become fully initiated into the church by receiving all the required sacraments including baptism, confirmation and the Eucharist, these traditions have been suspended due to coronavirus precautions, Shawver said. 
Additionally, Shawver said the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults has been postponed with no further plans for the program. 
However, Shawver said virtual masses have been going well for those who attend Mass at Our Savior. According to Shawver, the Revs. Richard Sunwoo and Joe Kim have been streaming Masses from chapels in their respective homes, with some members typing in prayers in the chat room during Masses on Zoom. Additionally, the Catholic Center has utilized Be.Live, another live streaming service, through Facebook to connect, including bringing local musical performers to be featured in mass, Shawver said.
“What was cool about [the Masses] was that we were able to bring in different students from around the country and different musicians from around L.A. to come in,” Shawver said. “So it was cool because we were able to bring the community together.”
Tritney Nguyen, a senior majoring in human biology who is also a member of the Catholic Center community, said it has been a “whole different ballgame” to be at home with her family, since she has spent the last three Easter Sundays on campus. For Holy Week, she and her family have been following the masses live-streamed by their local church in Georgia, setting up chairs in their living room and getting dressed to participate virtually. 
“It’s great to be with my family, but it’s not the same college environment where everyone’s young and has so much energy to do everything,” Nguyen said. “It’s a change, but you know, I’m trying to just channel that energy and other things I want to do to kind of have similar experiences at home.”
Similarly, Dave Cohn, the executive director for Hillel, has found it interesting to celebrate Passover in a remote digital environment. Cohn said Passover is a deeply personal family experience, especially since the Seder — the celebratory dinner at the start of Passover — is the most widely observed ritual in Judaism, with the highest participation among Jewish people. 
“When we’re in our normal routine, Hillel places an indispensable role of providing that experience in our campus home with a large Seder meal hosted by Hillel with hundreds of students in attendance,” Cohn said. “Those things we would normally provide for students, those aspects in our remote digital environment, they don’t ring true in the same way, and our approach from the outset was to honor that.”
Because the majority of students from Hillel are celebrating Passover with their families, Cohn said he and the rest of the Hillel staff did not want to supplant those experiences. Instead, Hillel staff has provided students with resources from a wide spectrum of partner organizations, as well as a few of its own.
“We wanted to make sure that students who were looking for ideas of how to observe Passover at home had a gateway to those things,” Cohn said.
Hillel staff has created a cheat sheet for placing a simple Seder meal together at home — especially if students are more limited on supplies — and a cookbook with family recipes. Additionally, Cohn said Hillel has offered unofficial “matchmaking” for students who are unable to have Seder with their families so that they could be connected to other families that are part of the Jewish community at USC. Hillel was able to make several matches. 
“We didn’t want to assume just because Seder is so widely observed that everyone had a place to ‘go,’” Cohn said.
For Clara Miller, a junior majoring in design, her family usually invites many people over for the two Seder meals on the first two nights of Passover. However, due to the pandemic, she and her family decided to connect with other families via Zoom, which she said was a little chaotic due to connectivity issues. 
“It was just a little weird,” Miller said. “We tried to position the computer in a way they could see all of the table, and my mom was yelling so that they could hear, [and] they wouldn’t hear and sometimes they disconnected. So it was a little bit chaotic and then trying to sing together, it was a total mess.”
However, Miller said that Passover has been a relief in itself during the pandemic. Despite having to transition to the online class format and being on lockdown due to coronavirus restrictions, Miller said she is grateful to be able to spend this year’s Passover with her family.
“Passover has been one of the least stressful things because Passover is about being with your family, and I haven’t been with my family the last two Passovers,” Miller said. “Out of everything, Passover is the kind of a thing where I’m like, ‘Oh, this is what we used to do when I was home.’”

In the days before students were displaced from USC’s campus due to the threat of coronavirus, I attended a USC basketball game, a Los Angeles Wildcats game and a Los Angeles Kings game. At each of these events, the impact of coronavirus seemed far away — I didn’t see a single person wearing a protective mask.
I never would have guessed that just three days later, my time covering basketball in Las Vegas would be cut short as the NCAA canceled the Pac-12 Tournament on March 12.
Now that it’s been a month since that fateful day in Vegas, I’ve been doing some reminiscing on some of the craziest, most memorable games I’ve attended since coming to USC in August 2018.
Here are a few of those.
Men’s basketball vs. UCLA
March 7, 2020
It was nearly impossible to pick just one game from a 2019-20 men’s basketball season that included so many nail biters. After the Trojans made a nearly impossible comeback to defeat Stanford in overtime Jan. 17, I tweeted that it was “the craziest game I’ve covered hands down.” That title stood until I witnessed USC’s final game of the season against UCLA.
The stakes were high — UCLA entered with a seven-game win streak, but USC needed a victory to boost its chances of securing a higher seed in March Madness. The game was tight throughout, but it looked like the Bruins had the final word as they led the Trojans 52-51 with nine seconds left on the clock.
In front of the sold-out crowd in his last game at Galen Center, senior guard Jonah Mathews nailed a stepback 3-pointer with only one second remaining to seal the Trojans’ victory. The team was so excited about the basket that they nearly forgot to defend UCLA’s final shot, and the cheering from the home crowd left my ears ringing.
The Trojans didn’t know at the time that it would be their last game of the season, but Mathews couldn’t have picked a better way to go out. It was a storybook ending that USC men’s basketball fans are unlikely to forget anytime soon.
Women’s basketball vs. UCLA 
Jan. 17, 2020
UCLA entered the game undefeated and sat at No. 7 in the nation. USC entered the game 0-5 in Pac-12 play. Although it looked to be a lopsided matchup, I figured a rivalry battle in front of packed student sections from both schools could lead to a close game. That being said, I definitely did not expect that the Trojans would scrape by the Bruins in double overtime.
USC rose to the challenge, ending the first half with a 12-0 run to lead UCLA by 13 going into the third quarter. I was in the student section, and while we were all excited about the apparent upset in progress, some of my peers who are less interested in sports wanted to leave the game early because it was turning into a blowout.
I convinced them to stay for the second half, and boy, I’m glad I did.
The game heated up in the third quarter as UCLA outscored USC 24-13, narrowing the Trojans’ once-commanding lead to just 2 points. The back-and-forth battle in the fourth quarter and beyond was electric on and off the court, as the USC student section tried to help the Trojans regain their momentum by outcheering UCLA’s spirit squad.
It looked like the Trojans would emerge victorious after the first overtime, but a buzzer-beater from UCLA redshirt junior guard Natalie Chou sent the game into double overtime.
USC finally came away with the hard-fought win — its first Pac-12 victory of the year — and I’ll never forget the joy of a young team which had just proved it could contend with anyone.
Football vs. Arizona State
Nov. 9, 2019
There was a lot of sighing going on in the press box this past football season, especially as USC’s defense failed to hold up when it mattered time and time again. As the Trojans surged to a 28-7 lead over Arizona State in the first quarter, no one could have guessed that this lead would nearly evaporate by the end of the game.
In the first quarter, freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis shattered the school record for passing yards in a quarter with 297. He also added four passing touchdowns, including a 95-yard connection with sophomore receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Trojans looked like a new team after getting annihilated by Oregon at home the previous weekend.
But it seemed all of this was too good to be true. A 62-yard touchdown by ASU kickstarted the Sun Devils’ momentum in the second quarter. We shook our heads in disbelief as the Trojans failed to capitalize on a forced fumble and again on an interception. And as if it couldn’t get any worse, Slovis left the game with a calf cramp in the third quarter, so the Trojans were depending on redshirt junior Matt Fink to take the snaps until the freshman returned in the fourth.
It looked as though the Sun Devils could put the game away as they drove past midfield with under a minute left. But sighs of despair turned to sighs of relief from Trojan fans in the press box as redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector came away with a diving interception to secure a 31-26 victory and, just barely, the Trojans’ bowl eligibility. This game will certainly be remembered for its roller-coaster ride of highs and lows.
Women’s water polo vs. UCLA
April 20, 2019
I’ll be honest, as fun as the women’s water polo team is to watch, you can usually expect USC to destroy its opponents. That’s why I look forward to the crosstown rivalry games with UCLA so much. Although I was a bit irritable after navigating public transportation to Westwood for the first time, it was difficult not to smile at the outcome of this game.
The 2019 Trojan squad was littered with new and old stars, including two Cutino Award finalists in then-senior goalie Amanda Longan and then-sophomore driver Paige Hauschild. Longan ended the game with 12 huge saves, while Hauschild put up a clutch 4-goal performance.
It looked like USC would handily put away yet another opponent as it carried a 9-5 lead heading into the final frame. However, UCLA wasn’t done yet — the Bruins scored 3 unanswered goals to put USC on edge for an exciting last few minutes.
Spieker Aquatics Center was packed, and the UCLA-dominated crowd did everything in its power to push its team toward an equalizer. But the Trojans held on to secure a 9-8 victory and earn the No. 2 seed in the 2019 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament.
Despite my disappointment in the abrupt ending to USC’s spring sports, I find comfort in reminiscing on these memorable moments. Reflecting on some of USC’s craziest contests in recent years has me even more excited for the return of NCAA competition, whenever that may be.

Every morning at 9 a.m., sophomore dance major Davon Farmer attends his ballet class through Zoom. It starts the same as always — with an exercise at the barre, a stationary handrail used in ballet. Away from the resources provided by the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center studios, Farmer practices with a chair instead.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Farmer’s professors instruct the ballet class through a blend of lecture and movement, and the session ends after reviewing several techniques. Then, Farmer is off to the rest of the day’s classes, which include a mix of hip-hop and contemporary dance, repertoire performance and improvisation classes all adjusted to the online space.  
“For my improvisation class, we worked on gyrokinesis [exercise], which is a lot of sitting down because people were limited with space,” Farmer said. “We’ll also watch different performance pieces and then write a short summary on how we feel about them … we’ll have to look at different pieces of choreography for different artists and create our own movement based off of that.”
USC students have been attending classes online since March 23. While all students and faculty have been adjusting to online learning, those in performance-based classes are especially challenged in adapting curriculums which rely on physical collaboration and feedback. 
“Depending on where you are, you cater what you do in class to the space that you have or where you live,” Farmer said. “So for me, I’ve had the luxury to have enough space to be able to barre and do center [floor combinations] and be able to participate in my hip-hop classes.” 
Since Farmer and his peers are unable to experience real-time correction or access a real barre, full-length mirrors, spring floors or other features normally available at Kaufman, his classes have dedicated more time toward studying other choreographers instead.
Although all stage productions have been canceled for the semester, Rebecca Tabor, a junior majoring in theatre, said her professors and peers have found creative approaches to acting in the absence of physical interaction. 
“A lot of people use the [virtual background] setting on Zoom comedically, but I was thinking because the scene takes place in a library, I can get creative and do a green screen of a big fancy library … and [my professor] really loved the idea,” Tabor said. “But at the same time, the limitations are it’s really hard to … genuinely emit emotion or action through the screen.”
Other challenges Tabor faces include performing stage directions during the Zoom class, because the scope of her “stage” is dependent on where she places her laptop to accurately show her whole body in her room.
Christian Lopez, a sophomore majoring in theatre, has seen changes in his acting and directing classes, including shifting assignments to self-recorded videos or changing the context of scene partners’ interactions. For example, Lopez and his classmates have tried to make remote learning work to their advantage by changing scenes so that the characters themselves communicate over Zoom or FaceTime.
“Our work is based on human interaction,” Lopez said. “I definitely don’t think this is going to inspire a new wave of online learning from theater classes in the future, but I think everyone’s getting creative and we’re all trying to work through it for now.” 
While theatre students are still able to perform together in a limited capacity, Dominic Anzalone, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance with an emphasis in drum-set, said he and his peers were scared of how they’d be able to continue the semester over Zoom with time lags and varying audio quality.  
“If you told me a couple months ago that we’d be going online, I would not believe you, especially as a performance major, that this is the only option right now,” Anzalone said. “But [popular music] faculty from the beginning were like, ‘How can we still make the rest of the semester effective?’ …  I feel like now I’m working on things that will really help me grow as a musician, not only [as] a drummer.” 
His “Popular Music Performance” class has been using the app Acapella. Users can record numerous soundtracks through video and post them in a collage that plays the clips simultaneously. Several instruments and vocal parts can be synchronized through the app, allowing Anzalone to create tracks and collaborate with people across the world.
Anzalone is also taking an “Aural Skills” class, which trains the ear to identify specific elements of music, such as pitch, intervals, chords and rhythm. This class is further complicated by technical difficulties over Zoom, but so far they’ve been able to adapt to them. 
“It’s been interesting,” Anzalone said, laughing. “We’ve been making sure to ask a lot of questions [in class] and the first week was figuring out the gimmicks of trying to get quality audio through Zoom, and I think we got them out of the way … Even the ensembles are done over Zoom, which is pretty surprising.” 
Francesca Boerio, a sophomore majoring in music with an emphasis in classical guitar and cognitive science, said although she has been trying to collaborate with peers over Zoom, she’s only able to rehearse her own part. Boerio takes individual instruction classes and is also a member of a guitar duo and a guitar orchestra. Despite her professor’s best efforts to pre-record videos of himself conducting and have students play along, they all play on mute and don’t know what other orchestra members are playing. 
“My teacher is really trying and still having us do rehearsals,” Boerio said. “But honestly, I would rather spend my time just learning new pieces or getting pieces ready for the fall so that we can play longer or more intense pieces that we normally wouldn’t be able to play in a semester.”
In terms of grading, Boerio still has juries, final performances in front of a panel of faculty. These will be done over Zoom, while other parts of her grading will come from video recordings of solo performances. Even before the pandemic and the switch to online learning, students in her department have performed degree recitals over Zoom or Facebook Live. 
Boerio also expressed her gratitude for her department’s efforts in sending out external microphones for students who don’t have their own. As a guitar player, she feels fortunate to play such a mobile instrument while other departments, such as percussion, are renting out and sending larger instruments to their students.  
“My teachers have definitely done a very good job of trying to make this all work,” Boerio said. “A lot of other instruments …  they don’t have marimbas or timpanis at home … Our faculty, our three teachers, are so accommodating and willing and really want us to still succeed from afar.”
Theodore Haber, a junior majoring in composition, is taking a violin ensemble class as well as a pottery wheel throwing class. For the violin ensemble, members have been recording snippets of themselves playing and sending them to each other. In response to the announcement of online learning for his ceramics class, Haber took matters into his own hands, literally. 
“I actually have a wheel, so I can still make [ceramics] on the wheel, which is nice, but a luxury,” Haber said. “It’s harder to see the demos [that the professor creates] at different angles.”
Purchasing a wheel made sense for Haber, who frequently makes ceramics and whose mother has a kiln. Despite his efforts to replicate his class experience at home, Haber said attending class in person can’t be replaced.
“It’s harder to feel connected to your peers and teachers, and being constantly on your computer is not great for your brain,” he said. “So [the semester] is still strenuous.” 
Shoshi Kanokohata, a lecturer for Haber’s ceramics course, has altered the class to make it as accessible as possible, despite the prerequisite tools and materials normally needed for the class. 
“We don’t have a wheel, we don’t know if we can fire …  so we needed to adjust the syllabus,” Kanokohata said. “Some of the changes are switching to hand-building …  and put in more sculptural elements to the assignments … I personally like food, so I went straight to the kitchen when I thought about ceramics in the house.”
Commonly used ceramics tools include whisks, plastic spatulas and rolling pins. Inspired by the parallels between cooking and ceramics, Kanokohata uses bread and bread-shaping videos as a substitute for clay. To make the class more accessible for students unable to leave their homes and to accomodate for flour shortages, he also asks students to make models out of cardboard or paper. 
Despite the challenges students and faculty are facing, Tabor, Anzalone and others are finding silver linings during this unprecedented time. Tabor had serious doubts about what students would gain from Zoom classes, but she said the creativity of the restructuring has made her more optimistic. 
“As I’m going through it with my teachers, we start thinking more outside of the box and try to learn as we go,” she said. “I do feel that it will help me in the long run, because most of my acting [and auditions] will be behind a camera … Having this experience with Zoom, even if it’s a fraction of an experience, I’ll be able to think outside of the box.”
Although music students no longer have the opportunity to perform together, Anzalone thinks this new method of learning and the time spent at home has brought his peers closer together.
“Now that everyone’s not playing gigs, everyone’s been focusing on themselves and working to make themself a better musician,” he said. “A lot of us have been collaborating on different projects …  I feel like the music community has been so strong throughout this whole process, everybody wanting to work together even though we can’t physically be together.”

The semi-autobiographical tale of writer-director Alan Yang’s father, “Tigertail” is an intimate, restrained portrayal of the immigrant experience — how one’s decision to leave their native home is often preceded with hope but followed with regret over what was left behind. 
As a child running around lush rice fields in Taiwan, Pin-Jui (Zhi-Hao Yang) is taught by his grandmother that “crying never solves anything.” All it shows is weakness, which isn’t a luxury his family can afford when they’re struggling to survive. Brief as the interaction may be, it establishes who Pin-Jui grows up to be: a detached man who never allows himself to be vulnerable. 
The film cuts back and forth between Pin-Jui’s past and the present where, as a rebellious young man (Hong-Chi Lee) in Taiwan, he dreams of life in the United States. Decades later, as a retiree in New York, Pin-Jui (Tzi Ma) struggles to connect with his daughter Angela (Christine Ko), resulting in the two often sitting in silence. All he wants is to move to the United States, not only to provide for his mother Minghua (Yang Kuei-Mei) but to be with his childhood sweetheart Yuan (Yo-Hsing Fang), the only person who makes him feel less lonely in this world. 
Though the characters live a life of poverty and work at a factory with poor labor conditions, the film portrays life in Taiwan as vibrant and colorful. Shots overlayed with grain, similar to the 35mm effect, make the recounts of the past feel like a memory, a recollection of a difficult upbringing. Yet, in hindsight, it was a time in his life that produced the most joyful moments.
Although the film is simple in its execution, Yang beautifully contrasts this visual style when the film shifts to the present to convey how separated Pin-Jui is from his family and friends. Everything around him is muted, from the beige walls in his house to the gray polos he wears. The lifelessness around him is a product of how distant he is as a person. 
Pin-Jui sees the physical strain that the factory job is taking on his mother and ultimately decides to leave Taiwan and move to the United States. The only way he could possibly move, however, is by agreeing to marry his boss’s daughter Zhenzhen (Kunjue Li), leaving his true love behind without any notice. 
Pin-Jui’s departure is not just him leaving his mother or his romantic partner, it’s him leaving Taiwan — the only home he’s ever known. Instead of a cathartic moment where mother and son emotionally embrace, unsure if they’ll ever see one another again, they simply stare at each other and go their separate ways. 
This scene, as well as many others, showcases Yang’s restraint in making the film, forgoing overdramatized scenes for quiet, simple sequences between characters. Although the decision to move is a painful one to make, for an immigrant like Pin-Jui, it’s a necessary choice that must be made for the chance at a better life.
Yang’s understanding of this predicament is only bolstered through the silence that runs through the film, creating instances of tenderness. The more time passes and the more silence fills the room, Yang successfully brings feelings of woe to the cinematic space. Despite this, never does the film stray toward excessive pessimism. There’s a fine balance: The audience witnesses a bittersweet feeling of love and hope that never materializes. 
The relationship between Pin-Jui and his wife, or the lack thereof, mirrors the relationship he has with his daughter later on in life. Both are hindered by his inability to express emotion. Angela wishes her father would express his care for her, but all he does is stare at her in confusion. Zhenzhen wishes her husband would put as much effort into their marriage as he does into his work.
For Pin-Jui and Zhenzhen, the American dream turns out to not be what they expected. Instead, it’s a dirty studio apartment and not knowing anyone except for one another. They only have each other for support, but even then, they don’t truly know each other. 
The two don’t have anything in common; nothing connects them as husband and wife. When Pin-Jui buys a piano with the intention of learning together, there’s a fleeting hope that they’ll finally connect in something. The realities of work and paying bills squander their chance at bonding; the piano is symbolically disregarded, piled under a stack of newspapers. 
Yang’s loose interpretation of his father’s life and relationships with his wife and daughter neither attempts to praise nor condemn him. “Tigertail” simply depicts a man who’s been taught to block out any emotion he may have, to put his head down and continue to work. Tragically, the result of his resilience is a community of loved ones who hardly know him. 
In Yang’s feature film debut, subtlety runs supreme. The quietly devastating flashback sequences and performances make “Tigertail” a touching tribute about the highs and the lows of the immigrant experience.

If you are trying to add a fresh routine to your life while social distancing, you might have already started following a daily list of to-dos. For myself, drinking wine is definitely on my to-do list, and it’s the one thing I am guaranteed to accomplish. After all, we are living through perhaps the most unprecedented events of our generation — a few sips of wine here and there couldn’t hurt. 
The absence of my regular schedule has given me the opportunity to think about other important aspects of life, particularly the current season of the “Real Housewives of New York City.” Watching the first episode made me wonder: Are personality types attracted to specific wines? With all this “free” time, I’ve pondered this question and in turn, jotted down some theories. Remember, these wine-based descriptions are (subjective) theories, not scientific facts. 
Pinot Noir
You’re a basic person. There’s nothing wrong with that, because I, myself, proudly identify as basic. Pinot noir drinkers pair greatly with any group of friends and have fans near and afar. You are consistently on top of the trends, which makes you a pop culture expert in your circle.
Pinot Grigio
Lovers of pinot grigio are cultured and sophisticated. You either have the potential to be an ambitious lawyer or a highly influential tastemaker on a reality TV show. You take whatever life throws at you and make it into your own masterpiece. 
Rosé
You like to please people and are rarely confrontational. After all, you’re not even a factor in the great wine debate — red or white. Meaning, you are the life of the party because no one at parties actually cares to hear other people’s opinions on wine. 
Cabernet Sauvignon
“An acquired taste” is perfect for describing those aligned with cabernet sauvignon. People either love you or hate you. That’s OK, because life is too short to deal with those who don’t appreciate your vibe. You overwhelm people initially, but that’s how you like to present yourself. 
Merlot
While we sip merlot because it’s one of the wines that is easiest to drink, merlot people are quite the catch. Merlots enjoy doing things spontaneously and believe in the power of going with the flow. You are a free spirit.
Riesling
You are a tough person that most people cannot crack. But for those that manage to uncover the external layers, they find you to be a bubbly person who’s honest and energetic to be around. People feel rewarded to be in your presence.
Sauvignon Blanc
Sauvignon blanc people are always on the go. Their social calendars outside of classes are always full of events and parties to attend. They cherish being around people and learning new things. People value their input and seek them out for fun times.
Malbec
People who enjoy malbec also enjoy the quiet solitude of life. We can find you reading a book on your front porch or in your room during your free time. You are always down for a chill hangout with friends. People find comfort in your ability to make the typically mundane interesting for everyone.
As you become a regular wine drinker, or perhaps you already are, you will start to notice that one’s wine choices are habitual. A lot of the theories I’ve conceived are based on the people I’ve shared a drink with around USC, so it might be different from your lived experience. Yet, with all this free time we now have, it might be fun to consider members in your own circle and which wines they align with.

Today, the future is uncertain — even tomorrow is not a given. As the world struggles to adjust to this new and strange reality, it seems that certain individuals have adapted enough to develop a new culture of crime. 
Zoombombing is the orchestrated intrusion into Zoom video-conferencing calls, with the intent to disrupt meetings and classes. Though the perpetrators and victims vary, the incidents follow a similar pattern: The meeting begins as normal and at some point, a voice echoes through the lecture — some out-of-place phrase — but the speaker continues. That same voice cuts back in, more persistent, building in volume. 
What once was nonsensical babbling suddenly becomes clear: The stranger is chanting the n-word or some other slur. The meeting facilitator scrambles to reclaim control, to identify the intruder. Even if the perpetrator is expelled, there are countless others embedded in the online crowd. Suddenly, the screen switches: A stranger appears or begins streaming pornographic or violent content. The obtrusive voices form a cacophony of auditory assault. The meeting is shut down; by this point, the majority of users have either logged off or remain shocked in disbelief. 
At USC, there have been several cases of Zoombombing; the first reported ones in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the other in Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. But who’s doing it? And why?
The New York Times reported 153 Instagram accounts, dozens of Twitter accounts and several then-active message boards on Reddit and 4Chan where thousands of people had gathered for the purpose of organizing Zoom raids. Some accounts, run by middle- and high school-aged students, operate with the goal to disrupt classes in a relatively mild and inoffensive manner to communicate their frustrations; others, like swarms of cockroaches, prefer to conspire in the darker corners of the Web. 
On Discord — an app known to be popular in far-right circles — The New York Times found 14 active chats with users sharing meeting passwords and establishing point values for certain types of harassment. Take into account that within a single chat, dozens of messages are being sent per minute — with one housing more than 2,000 users — and the term “Zoombombing” seems less like harmless trolling and more like digital terrorism. 
The latter is a serious claim. For every relatively harmless class interruption by a middle-schooler, there are far more Alcoholics Anonymous meetings commandeered, minority-specific groupings targeted with hate speech and religious events attacked with pornographic content. During these intrusions, specific audience members are sometimes targeted, as was the case in a Conejo Valley School District meeting March 24. Board members were sexually harassed, and an unknown voice threatened that home addresses could be discovered as easily as a Zoom meeting password. 
This type of trolling is all about control; the intruder sneaks into a meeting that was meant to be private and forces the captive audience to see and listen to whatever is being broadcasted. Even though individuals are physically safe — these intruders are not actually in your computer, since Zoom is an external application and thus isn’t integrated into your device’s security — it still feels violating. The use of derogatory and threatening language and pornographic content is purposefully abrasive, meant to use shock value to attack people who are already feeling isolated during this period of self-quarantine.
There is no doubt that Zoom should be held accountable. The company is already under fire from the New York Attorney General and the FBI. It’s more of a question of whether these problems were unavoidable given the unprecedented influx in the user population. 
According to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Zoom was aimed toward institutions with full IT support, such as government agencies, universities and financial services. This seems a little unsubstantiated, given that many universities have already fallen victim to Zoombombers. 
It’s obvious that the system was not adequately prepared for the sudden wave of new users flooding the online communication app. In addition, Zoom’s claim of “end-to-end encryption for all meetings” has been disproved with each disrupted meeting — thorough encryption isn’t possible if any participants are logged in from a non-computer device. Oded Gal, Zoom’s chief product officer, admitted to the semantic discrepancy overlooked in the advertising.
Yuan has apologized for his company’s shortcomings and committed the next 90 days to bolstering privacy issues instead of adding new features; in addition, the company will release a transparency report which will detail government authority requests for data or content — similar to those shared by Facebook, Google and Twitter.
There will always be those who feel emboldened to spew hate from behind a computer screen, to find and exploit others’ weaknesses. Yesterday it was xenophobes, today it’s Zoombombers, tomorrow it’ll be some other breed of societal cockroach. And those insectoids will always find each other in dark times; in this way, people are remarkably adaptive — for better or worse. 
We must guard ourselves against this new culture of virtual hate.

April is National Poetry Month, a celebration of an art form as beautiful and breathtaking as it is misunderstood. Poetry sometimes garners a reputation for being aloof or ambiguous, confined to literary and academic settings. Is poetry too challenging for the average person to attempt or understand? Absolutely not. On the contrary, poetry is for everyone to read and write, and in a time like this, poetry can be used for refuge, mental exercise and as a source of joy. 
Like listening to a piece of music, reading poetry triggers an emotional response in the brain, including in areas connected to introspection. It allows for a kind of self-reflection lacking in other forms of texts. Poetry is a perfect conduit for encouraging deep thoughtfulness and gratitude, leading toward more purposeful, empathetic lives. 
The best part is that poems are everywhere. Many are short and easy to read, and services such as “Poem a Day” are especially good for curated content. Websites including The Poetry Foundation and Poets.org have thousands of works, showcasing poets of all styles, backgrounds and foci.
Inspiration for writing poetry is everywhere, too. Though most students are confined to their homes, this doesn’t mean creativity is stifled — it’s actually blossoming. Boredom is a necessary aspect of the creative process. It is through boredom that the brain searches for inspiration, for the next big idea — or in this case, for the best words to put down on paper. 
Writing poetry may be intimidating. There are several poetic forms that apply stricter rules about meter, rhyme, structure and form, but this is not a requirement. Poetry has no hard-and-fast rules. That is one of its wonders. There is no need to dive into the most difficult forms on the first go. Perhaps inspiration comes from an old photograph, a memory, a color, a landscape or simply personal surroundings. 
Inspiration is abundant, maybe especially so, in times of crisis. What better way to cope with feelings of anxiety, stress or uncertainty than writing? Any kind of writing can be cathartic, but poetry is special. While many find frustration in poetry’s mystery, abstractness or ambiguity, that is exactly why it is so liberating. Poetry can be abstract or literal, metaphorical or direct. It is a safe space to explore, to feel a full range of emotions without fear. Once these emotions find their way onto the page, it’s both grounding and freeing.
Poetry is a valuable tool for any student, from English and creative writing majors to those pursuing a STEM degree. Strong analytical skills, attention to the economy of language and the practice of learning (and occasionally breaking) grammar rules can all be found in poetry. There is room for lessons harder to grasp when studying prose or doing literary analysis. For students unfamiliar with the form, it can also serve as a much-needed break from rigorous major classes. 
To begin writing, start simply. Try collecting a few phrases throughout the day: thoughts, emotions, images. At the end of the day, try stringing them together. Write about what is seen and felt. If struggling to find a muse, read other poets. This is one of the best methods to absorb the poetic lexicon. 
If uninterested in writing, there are other ways to support poets and keep poetry in our collective consciousness. One solution is buying from independent bookstores and publishers who need our help now more than ever. With small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, more and more have had to close their doors and hope that online sales keep them going. 
The beloved Last Bookstore in downtown Los Angeles is one such business. As of March 19, the store closed to the public, but it continues to fill orders by mail and through other services like Amazon and eBay. It even offers curated packages to fit specific interests. 
Outside of the University, poets continue to offer online workshops, classes and readings. With all in-person events moved online, there are still ways to engage with the poetry community at USC. Dornsife Dialogues is offering How Pandemics Impact Art on April 22, a conversation around the ways art becomes a “diary of human history.” To read poetry from the USC community, check out Palaver Magazine, USC’s student-run publisher Gold Line and Ricochet Press, The Healing Process, Scribe Magazine, or follow USC English or The Literary Society. 
Despite its complexity, this art form is worth a chance, whether it’s for the simple pleasure of reading the masters or discovering a poet that inspires your own writing. In a time of profound separation, poetry unites all, a reminder that art is just as vital to human survival (and sanity) as anything else.

When sophomore Kyle Adomian was a freshman taking calculus at USC, he sought the help of a non-USC affiliated tutor. After working with a tutor who was generally familiar with calculus but unfamiliar with the type of calculus taught in his class, Adomian came up with TutorTies, a college tutoring platform that connects students with tutors who have experience in specific USC classes. 
“The tutors were distant, and they lacked the familiarity with the specific course at USC, or even the specific professor,” said Adomian, a business administration major. “They would need time to understand not only the concepts you were going through, but the teaching styles of the teacher [and] how you as a student interpret certain things, and we saw that as almost a waste of time and money.” 
TutorTies will launch in the fall as an app, but the platform is currently offering a “tutor matching concierge” service during the remote learning period. Similar to how the app will function, Adomian, along with his team, matches students with tutors based on classes and professors. 
He started reaching out to students last month to tell them about the service. It was a lot of dirty work, Adomian said: looking at teacher assistant schedules to find possible tutors, reaching out to students via email and going through the student directory. Currently, TutorTies has 80 tutors signed up, who have booked 20 sessions in about three weeks. So far, some students have had weekly sessions, and others have had daily sessions with their tutor. 
“We just recently started putting it out there that students can fill out a Google form with their specific specifications on what they need help with,” Adomian said. “We do basically what the app would do and match you … with a tutor.”
Sarah Russell, a graduate student studying business analytics who found out about TutorTies through an email from Adomian, had a tutoring session for modern statistical learning methods over Zoom. Russell said TutorTies asked for the project and data sets she was working on beforehand, so her tutor was ready for their session. 
“He had already come up with different ideas to help,” Russell said. “He’d already played with the data, looked at the project and everything — so super well-prepared, very friendly.”
The app, which is still being developed, will allow both students and tutors to set up their profiles with information about their subject, classes and professors. Students and tutors will then be able to search the TutorTies platform to find similar matches. When either a student or a tutor swipes on another corresponding profile, both will be placed into a chat room to schedule a session. What makes TutorTies unique to other tutoring platforms is the tutors’ ability to initiate the conversation, Adomian said. Users have the option to meet online or in person. 
“Why we decided to do swipe-to-match for the students is this kind of dopamine rush that surrounds this new kind of trend of swiping to match,” Adomian said. “It’s this concept of gamifying a fairly mundane task.”
The swipe-to-match technology is a part of a wider effort to streamline the tutoring process. Along with that, tutors’ payments are deposited into their bank accounts immediately, Adomian said. Currently, there is no maximum price the tutors can charge, although Adomian hopes to create a lower bound to avoid a bidding war among tutors.  
Fang Fu, a graduate student studying chemistry, has already done two Zoom conferences with her student on organic chemistry material. Fu, who had previously worked as an organic chemistry teaching assistant, said TutorTies helped her learn new techniques for her lab, which is mainly about organic synthesis. 
“It’s not only that I can help the students — it’s also helped me to go through the concept and some principles of organic chemistry, which I learned when I was an undergraduate,” Fu said. “It’s also to make the knowledge more solid, and it’s also helped me a lot.”
Adomian plans to expand TutorTies to nearby schools, including UCLA and Loyola Marymount University. He and Austin Hill, head of design and content curation, hope to target the colleges their high school friends attend and begin to recruit ambassadors for their service.
“I think the goal initially is just to become the most used tutoring service and get the name spread out among USC,” said Hill, a sophomore majoring in economics. “I know Kyle has bigger goals for the future, like trying to implement it at other schools, but that would be further in the future.”
Adomian said he hoped TutorTies would provide a more streamlined, personal experience for students looking for help with classes.
“I want to be able to provide a service … to make the process of going through school and getting your degree something that is not easier, but more manageable,” Adomian said. “Nobody wants to spend hours of their undergraduate career looking for the right tutor being charged too much from a big tutoring company.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that TutorTies tutors had booked 20 sessions in three months. They booked the sessions in about three weeks. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

An EVK employee has tested positive for the coronavirus, USC Hospitality and Student Health confirmed in an email to EVK staff Sunday. The employee last worked in the kitchen Tuesday and attended a meeting in the staff room Friday. 
The University sent a second email Monday to customers who visited EVK Tuesday. The message, which reminds students to limit community spread by following hygiene practices, has been posted to the USC coronavirus website.
“Individual employees with possible exposure have been contacted and received instructions for self monitoring,” the email to EVK employees read. “Please know the Community Kitchen follows strict cleaning guidelines on a daily basis. Enhanced cleaning of the Community Kitchen was completed Sunday night.”
Individuals who may have come in close contact with the employee have been notified of the case and asked to self-monitor for symptoms, the email to employees read. Both messages asked students and staff to continue to comply with social distancing, face covering and handwashing guidelines and to report illnesses to Student Health.
