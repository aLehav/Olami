The fate of a prospective union of USC graduate student workers will hinge on a Feb. 15 to 16 election, the National Labor Relations Board confirmed in a notice Wednesday. A simple majority vote of union-eligible workers will decide the outcome.
Negotiations last month between USC and the coalition — formally named the Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee — defined union-eligible workers as all teaching assistants, assistant lecturers, research assistants, students funded through training grants and fellows in STEM disciplines.
“We are united in a belief that by banding together we can have greater support and better lives,” the GSWOC wrote in a Monday press release. “With a union, we can address problems like earning less than a living wage, insufficient healthcare benefits, discrimination, bullying and harassment, and a lack of legal and structural support for international workers.”
The University declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment on the coming election. 
In an early January faculty memo, Kelvin Davies, interim vice provost for academic and faculty affairs, wrote that the University does “not believe that unionization is in the best interests of our graduate students.” 
Voting on University Park Campus will commence in shifts starting at 8 a.m. on Feb. 15 in the west building lobby of Wallis Annenberg Hall. The election at the Health Sciences Campus and Buck Institute will occur simultaneously in the Clinical Services Center and Drexler Auditorium, respectively. All voters must wear face coverings under the agreed-upon election policy.
This month’s vote has been a long time coming: The GSWOC began mustering followers in the summer of 2020 and, in 2021, conducted climate surveys and began floating unionization. The group started distributing union authorization cards in April 2022, which roughly 60% of eligible workers signed by December of that year, triggering a two-day hearing with the NLRB last month.

With less than two months until the 2023 NCAA women’s March Madness tournament begins, the race for the 68 available spots is heating up. 
The defending champions, South Carolina Gamecocks, remain unbeaten and are the heavy favorite to win heading into the latter half of the season. However, the rest of the teams continue to battle it out for the remaining 67 allocations, including a sleuth of Pac-12 teams. 
In ESPN’s most recent Bracketology breakdown, they predict eight Pac-12 teams to make the tournament, tied with the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big Ten for the most teams. Stanford, Utah, UCLA, Colorado, Oregon, Washington State, Arizona and USC are the eight projected qualifiers. 11 out of the 12 teams in the conference boast a winning record. This makes the Pac-12 an extremely competitive conference, resulting in many teams eyeing a chance to compete in March. 
As of Jan. 31, the Trojans are expected to be a nine seed, in which they would theoretically open up against the Alabama Crimson Tide in Bloomington, Indiana.
So what are the prospects for the Pac-12 contenders, and who has a realistic chance of not only making the tournament but potentially making a deep run? 
USC Trojans
After a disappointing 12-16 season last year, USC hopes to return to March Madness under Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, a former assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Trojans began the new season with a dominant 10-0 start to the season, but have since cooled off, currently sitting at a 16-5 record. USC’s signature win came on Jan. 15, when the Trojans stunned the then No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal 55-46. Despite the impressive victory and USC’s most recent win against the then No. 25 ranked Colorado Buffaloes, these have been the only two ranked wins for the Trojans this season. They also have ranked losses to Oregon, Utah and have been beaten twice against crosstown rival UCLA. 
USC’s remaining schedule consists of only Pac-12 teams, giving the team plenty of competition to fix lingering issues and prepare for the tournament in March. Barring a collapse, the Trojans appear to be positioned for March Madness. USC will likely rely on their defensive prowess, which leads the Pac-12 in points allowed, giving up only 53 points per game, and is second in blocks per game (BPG), averaging 5.5 BGP, to pull off a potential first-round upset. However, USC’s inconsistencies against ranked opponents put the ability of the Trojans to make a deep run in the tournament into question. 
Stanford Cardinal
The Cardinal continue to impress. Stanford has only lost to the undefeated Gamecocks and USC, putting it at a strong 21-2 record, and is ranked third in the country. Led by junior forward Cameron Brink who leads the country in blocks per game, Stanford has amassed a series of impressive wins against ranked Pac-12 opponents and non-conference matchups like Creighton and Tennessee. Stanford’s remaining schedule is grueling, with a four-game road trip followed by matchups against three ranked teams in UCLA, Colorado and Utah. 
Stanford is poised to lock in a number one seed according to ESPN’s Bracketology. It is evident that Stanford’s impressive regular season so far makes them a championship contender and they will prove a fierce competitor against the reigning champions. 
UCLA Bruins
UCLA have lost their last two games to Pac-12 opponents, Colorado and Utah, putting them at 17-5 on the season. Both losses however were extremely close and the No. 14 ranked Bruins are a projected four seed in this year’s tournament. UCLA only has two more games against currently ranked opponents in Arizona and Stanford, giving them an opportunity to coast into the postseason with some confidence. 
Efficiency remains an issue for the Bruins. They rank second to last in the Pac-12 in shooting percentage, a disappointing 40.1% from the field. If UCLA wishes to cap off its season with a couple of wins in March, its offensive efficiency will require a significant boost. 
Utah Utes
If one wants to talk about dominant starts to the season, then look no further than the Utes. Utah began the season 14-0, which included impressive displays of offense, epitomized by their 124-point romp over then No. 16 ranked Oklahoma. The No. 7 ranked Utes now sits with a 18-2 record and are projected to be a two seed in the tournament.
Utah’s play style is certainly a unique one. They lead the conference in points, field goal percentage and point differential. On the other hand, they are in the bottom half of the conference in points allowed, rebounds and blocks. Utah has proved to be an offensive juggernaut, but whether or not they can limit their opponents’ ability to keep up will determine their success come March. 
Arizona Wildcats
The No. 22 ranked Wildcats have been relatively consistent all year long, but have yet to distinguish themselves from the elite teams in the Pac-12. They have cleaned up against non-conference opponents and had two quality wins against Baylor and Oregon, both of whom are no longer ranked. However, a string of recent losses to strong Pac-12 teams raises the question of how the Wildcats will compete against a strong opponent in the tournament. They also seem to possess a similar flaw as the Utes: a strong ability to score the ball, but difficulties on the defensive end. 
Despite all this, Arizona is predicted to land a six seed in this year’s March Madness and could be a multiple-round team if they continue to play consistent basketball. 
Some other teams to look out for include the Oregon Ducks, the Washington State Cougars and the Colorado Buffaloes, all of whom made the most recent Bracketology cut. 
It is clear that the Pac-12 will be a force to be reckoned with in the 2023 NCAA women’s basketball tournament. Ranging from powerhouses to sleepers, March Madness could very well see one of the West’s finest hold the championship hardware.

After a statement win against then-No. 8 UCLA last Thursday, the men’s basketball team moved off of the NCAA tournament bubble as they jumped from the “Next Four Out” group to a projected No. 9 seed in Joe Lunardi’s latest Bracketology. The Trojans will now look to ride the momentum when Washington State comes to town on Thursday.
The two teams faced off earlier this season at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman, with the Cougars defeating the Trojans 81-71 in a fairly uncontested matchup. Despite out-rebounding Washington State, USC shot just 16.7 percent from the 3-point line, which contributed to the 10-point loss.
The 3-point line will likely be a factor again in this upcoming matchup as the Trojans look to amend their struggles in that facet of the game. This season, USC is shooting only 32.6 percent from behind the arc, a mark that ranks 268th in the entire country. 
“We’ve had about seven or eight games shooting 3-18, 2-17, 3-19,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We need to make open shots and I think our offensive flow has been getting better as we’ve progressed through the season.”
Washington State is led by junior guard TJ Bamba, who is averaging a team-high 14.6 PPG, and sophomore forward Mouhamed Gueye, who is averaging a team-high 8.3 rebounds per game. Both Bamba and Gueye finished with double figures in the win against the Trojans in January, and the Cougars will need both of their stars to have big games again if they want to complete the season sweep over USC.
“We know we have to perform better on the defensive end,” said Enfield. “It’s just not stopping one or two players, but stopping them as a group.”
As they have all season, the Trojans will look to their star veteran guards, senior Boogie Ellis (16.3 ppg) and fifth-year Drew Peterson (14 ppg) to lead them to another victory. 
Ellis is coming off a career-high 31-point game in the comeback win against UCLA in which he scored 27 points in the second-half. However, he emphasized putting his historic night behind him.
“It’s over now,” said Ellis in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “So just focusing on Washington State, having confidence, playing my game [and] staying in the moment.”
Peterson, who led the Trojans with 16 points and eight rebounds in their loss to the Cougars, looks to replicate his success on Thursday. 
“Yeah it was good to be able to score a little bit,” said Peterson. “We got the loss so what’s more important is getting everything going defensively…We’re trying to avenge that last time we were up in Pullman.”
USC comes into this game as the winners of 10 straight at home, not having lost at Galen Center since their season opener against Florida Gulf Coast University back in November. On the other hand, Washington State has struggled mightily on the road, with a 1-6 record when playing away from the Beasley Coliseum this season.
Galen Center was at a season-high 94% capacity against UCLA with approximately 9,605 people in attendance to watch the comeback win. Although Washington State is not as big of a rival as the Bruins were, another large fan attendance will aid the Trojans in defending their home court once again. 
“As a kid, I dreamed of playing in environments like that,” said Ellis. “If the Galen Center was filled like that every night, we would not lose a game.”
Despite being in the bottom half of the Pac-12 Standings with a 5-7 conference record, the Cougars are a dangerous team that USC can’t overlook. Not only because the Trojans have lost to them before, but because Washington State has big wins over Arizona State and No. 5 Arizona. 
“We have a lot to play for, this is what you play college basketball for,” said Enfield when asked about not becoming complacent after a big win over UCLA. “Our guys are playing very good basketball and they understand what’s at stake and how hard they have to play.”
As the Trojans enter their final month of games before March, their NCAA Tournament hopes are looking promising if they continue playing as they did against UCLA. However, that starts by not slipping up for the second time against an underrated Washington State team.
The Trojans will take on Washington State at 8 p.m. on Thursday at Galen Center.

The tabled discussion from last week’s Senate meeting to implement a run-off voting system for this upcoming election period and a rank-based voting system for future elections resumed at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. 
This year there are five presidential candidates, so the discussion was raised that even if a candidate were to win 20.01% of the vote, the majority of the student body would have a president that they did not vote for. 
“I’m concerned because under the current bylaws [the elections] have the potential to be conducted unfairly,” said chief of staff Diego Andrades. “We’ve never been in a situation where the laws of the current electoral system are visible and significant. However, it’s the responsibility of this senatorial body to remedy this flaw.”
The Senate discussed and voted to amend the election bylaws that in the event that no candidate receives more than a one-third majority of the total votes excluding abstentions, a run-off election will be held. Senators could only vote if they were not actively campaigning in the election. Of the eligible senators, the amendment was passed 6-0. 
“I think that this election is about the voters, not the candidates,” said senator Sanjana Sambhwani. “We’re not trying to be on some power high and manipulate the student government or the student body. We’re doing this so that our voters’ votes matter … I think that the run-off will give more power to voters.”
With the upcoming election so close, many of the candidates expressed concern over changes to the elections code so near to the voting period and possibly giving more room for the elections committee to make changes in the future. 
“We don’t just make up these rules on the spot,” senator Yoav Gillath said. “That’s kind of what being an electoral system is all about and being a democracy. It’s having rules and sticking to those rules regardless of who runs.”
The Senate agreed to table the motion to establish a ranked-choice voting system for future elections after the current elections period is over. Under this system, voters can rank their choices for a candidate rather than simply picking one candidate. 
“My thoughts were with the tabling is to let the election stuff cool down before we make the decision for future elections,” senator Maria Barun said. 
Vice President Nivea Krishnan presented updates in regards to the Fryft program, providing a timeline of the changes. Prior to 2017, the University used Campus Cruisers, a student-run shared ride service and then started its partnership with Lyft in 2017 which started with the shared ride model. 
In compliance with the Los Angeles County policy due to the coronavirus outbreak, Lyft removed the option for shared rides and students were able to utilize the single-rider Fryft program. The University recently switched back to its original shared-ride model. 
The University found that the single-ride model was a financially unsustainable model for the school, thus switching to the shared-ride model. 
“I know there’s been a lot of frustration around wait times,” Krishnan said. “I’m personally frustrated with wait times, too. The best response we could get was that drivers across the country are still getting used to this system as, for three years, there was no shared ride option on Lyft.” 
USG is hoping to address the concern about safety and is currently collecting student feedback about it. 
“We want to point out that the stigma a lot of students have that riding with community members is what makes things unsafe should be reevaluated,” Krishnan said. “Put into perspective that we are students that came into a community that has already existed for hundreds of years, and just because you are riding with a non-USC student doesn’t mean you’re necessarily any less safe.”
Barun gave updates on USC ID card integration, a project she is working on to allow students to use their ID card on their mobile devices. This project is projected to cost $2.5 million as the hardware needs to be updated in all places on campus for students to be able to use both physical and digital ID cards. 
USG swore in senator William Lee, a senior majoring in history and political science, who replaced former senator Sam Nadol who resigned due to studying abroad. 
USG communications department appoints Joanne Lee, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, as the assistant director of creative services. 
The Senate unanimously voted to cancel the Senate meeting on Feb. 14 in the case that a presidential debate is held.

Every K-pop fan is convinced that their favorite groups have the best rappers in the game. If you ask a diehard ARMY, it’s BTS’ RM, Suga and J-Hope. Ask a BLINK and they’ll likely answer BLACKPINK’s Jennie and Lisa. For an ATINY? It’s ATEEZ’s Hongjoong and Mingi for sure. 
As someone who is a self-proclaimed multi-stan of over a dozen groups and who has been fully immersed in the K-pop lifestyle for over five years, it’s safe to say that I have substantial credibility when it comes to this topic. But it’s still important to note that it’s all just conjecture. Just my opinion. 
I also feel it necessary to point out that I will only be focusing on third and fourth generation idols (basically groups post-BTS debut — K-pop debuts are usually grouped into “generations” of five-ish years in order to more easily define a timeline) and will be revealing my top five. Also note, I will not be mentioning solo artists — only rappers who are part of established groups. 
In terms of my ranking, I take into consideration a wide array of facets, the most important of which being speed (syllables per second), musicality and enunciation. Other sub-facets include swag (self-explanatory) and production (if they produce or write their own lyrics). 
Here’s my analysis and ranking of the top five third and fourth generation K-pop rappers:
5. Kim Hong Joong (김홍중) from ATEEZ
At 5 foot 8 inches, not a lot of people would expect the absolute power that comes from this man. And in all honesty, Hongjoong’s abilities, although undeniably outstanding, had never really stood out to me in a meaningful capacity in comparison to other K-pop rappers. However, ATEEZ’s release of “Halazia” this past December showed me a side of Hongjoong that I didn’t know I was missing. His ability to so effortlessly and seamlessly rap in a triplet rhythm was truly ethereal. The swag? This man invented swag. And to top it all off, he and fellow ATEEZ member Mingi wrote the entire song together. Chef’s kiss. 
4. Jeon So-yeon (전소연) from (G)I-DLE
Now, I don’t want people to come at me for only putting one girl group member on my list. I really believe that management companies thwart female artists from reaching their true potential, especially when it comes to rap — a typically very male-dominated field. 
I give Soyeon a boatload of credit in terms of making room for herself atop the podium of K-pop rappers. Her true defining performance for me was most definitely in (G)I-DLE’s “Oh my god,” released in 2020. Her known speed record is eight syllables per second, and her creative abilities in terms of lyricism won her Songwriter of the Year at the Melon Music Awards, one of the biggest annual K-pop award shows, this past November. She has continued to make a name for herself in the industry, and does an immense amount of work for her group —not to mention that the consistency in her voice and raps is incredible.
3. Do Han-Se (도한세) from VICTON
Here’s a curveball who a lot of K-pop fans likely don’t know about. VICTON in general is an extremely underrated group. They have about 470,000 monthly listeners on Spotify compared to ATEEZ’s 3.8 million and 756,000 Instagram followers compared to (G)I-DLE’s 9.2 million. Regardless, their discography is outstanding. 
Hanse undeniably has one of the most iconic and unique looks in K-pop. He’s covered in tattoos, is extremely open to androgynous style and even adorns some facial piercings which is extremely rare in K-pop. And he has one of the most impressive rap styles that I have ever encountered. 
He hits every syllable like his life depends on it. I mean, you really gotta give this guy a listen. He has some of the best enunciation of any rapper I know (one of the main reasons why he’s in my top three) — a skill that is flawlessly put on display in VICTON’s “What I Said” and “Virus.” Listen to them. You’ll thank me later.
2. Seo Chang-Bin (서창빈) from Stray Kids
Picking between my top two was honestly extremely difficult, and what won out was age. Stray Kids debuted March 2018, giving them only four years to impress me, versus BTS’ nine (spoiler for the number one spot). 
Changbin’s rapping abilities first caught my eye in 2019 with Stray Kids’ release of “MIROH.” His part in that song is pure power. Rapping was made for this man, and he was more recently able to show off his individual talent in “Show Me the Money,” a Korean rap battle-style show, although he was eliminated rather prematurely. 
Not only does he help write and produce many of Stray Kids’ songs, but he also is one of, if not the fastest rapper in K-pop. His record stands at 11.13 syllables per second, and the way you can tell that he gets lost in his lyrics and rapping is honestly magical to witness.
1. Min Yoon-Gi (민윤기) from BTS
Maybe I am a little biased as BTS was the group that got me into K-pop, but after going to so many of their concerts and witnessing firsthand the man himself in his element, I have to give the rap crown to Min Yoongi (stage name SUGA). 
Yoongi has been writing, producing and rapping since his early teens. The slight lisp in his already raspy voice elevates his style to an unmatched echelon, something you can hear perfectly in BTS’ “BTS Cypher Pt.2: Triptych” and “2nd Grade”. He has a hand in a vast amount of BTS’ productions, and has written and produced two of his own solo albums, “Agust D” and “D-2.” 
This man was undeniably made to rap. He bleeds musicality. He breathes lyricism. Having been able to see him perform live three separate times has been a true blessing. He has still yet to be beaten in my eyes. 
Although I may have greatly minimized these talented individuals to a few sentences and a numerical ranking, it’s always important to remember the uniqueness and individuality that every rapper brings to the game. They’re all extremely talented and inspirational.

As February approaches and we all gear up for an onslaught of consumerist romance over the next 28 days, here’s everything worth looking out for on your favorite streaming services. From charming rom-coms to neo-noir psychological thrillers, there’s no shortage of movies and TV shows to sit back and relax with this upcoming month.
Disney+
“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” — Feb. 1
For anybody who didn’t manage to catch this phenomenon of a sequel in theaters, this is a lovely watch for hardcore MCU fans and Marvel-averse moviegoers alike. It’s a somber watch, with a painful void in the center where Chadwick Boseman would have been. Shuri, played by a commanding Letitia Wright, leads this uncharacteristically sincere superhero movie, with powerful performances from Angela Bassett, Tenoch Huerta and “I May Destroy You’s” Michaela Coel. If you’re looking for a healthy dose of action and a fitting tribute to Boseman, this is worth putting on for a night in.
HBO Max
“Empire of Light” — Feb. 7
This gorgeous film has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, and rightly so. Set in a little seaside town in Britain in the ‘80s, Sam Mendes directs the extraordinary Olivia Colman who plays Hilary, a troubled movie theater manager. Films about films are huge right now — from Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” to Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon.” The meta magic of movies is perfectly bottled in “Empire of Light,” making it one of the most immersive stories to be brought to our homes from the big screen.
Amazon Prime
“Somebody I Used to Know” — Feb. 10
Coming out in time for Valentine’s Day, this rom-com directed by Dave Franco stars “Community’s” Alison Brie as a tightly-wound television producer who reconnects with her hometown and first love Sean, played by Jay Ellis. From the trailer, it seems reminiscent of ‘90s rom-coms with Cassidy, Sean’s fiancé, turning this into a classic love triangle. Although unsurprisingly, given Franco’s usual style of storytelling, the official term in the logline is “unconventional” which could be great news for fans of less-defined happy endings in romantic comedies, like that of “My Best Friend’s Wedding.”
Apple TV+
“Sharper” — Feb. 17
Apple TV+ rarely disappoints with its high quality content that places an emphasis on distinctive storytelling and from the looks of it, A24’s “Sharper’’ is no different. With a star-studded cast featuring Julianne Moore, Sebastian Stan, Justice Smith and John Lithgow, this new thriller is bound to be a rollercoaster of excellent acting and edge-of-your-seat drama. In this, Stan plays Max, a troubled young man who decides to rob his mother’s (Moore) billionaire boyfriend. The trailer is set to Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings,” a clever choice that gives this film an edge and reaffirms that nobody is who they seem to be.
Netflix
“You” — Season 4 Part 1  — Feb. 9
Another thriller on the list. “You” returns with the ever-creepy Joseph “Joe” Goldberg, played by Penn Badgley, ready for another round of stalking and sociopathic violence. This season is set in London after Joe was last infatuated with Marienne in Paris, declaring her to be his one “true” love. Fans of this show have come to expect a certain panache and charm from its delusional protagonist, and hopefully this season doesn’t disappoint. One hope for this season of “You”, however, is definitely that it doesn’t try to continue on a morality arc and sanitize Joe of his crimes, especially considering that below the shock-value drama and attractive “love” interests is a deeply violent core, making for a grim but thrilling watch.
“Your Place or Mine” — Feb. 10
From the iconic Elle Woods played by Reese Witherspoon to Ashton Kutcher’s pretty-boy Michael Kelso in “That ‘70s Show,’ Netflix’s newest rom-com is perfect nostalgia fodder for anyone who rues the death of the classic rom-com. It follows a pair of middle-aged best friends — Witherspoon and Kutcher — as they swap houses and attempt to navigate the ups and downs of aging combined with their 20-year-old will-they-won’t-they romance (spoiler: they will). The cast’s chemistry looks promising, with a special shoutout to Wesley Kimmel, who plays Witherspoon’s son and his trait, like any good rom-com child, of asking piercing and insightful questions to further the central relationship. An ideal rom-com is steeped in joyful escapism, and this movie certainly seems like it will provide.
“Outer Banks” — Season 3 — Feb. 23
Finally, towards the end of February, comes a new season of “Outer Banks” with even more surprises than the last in store for the audience. Chase Stokes, Madelyn Cline, Madison Bailey, Jonathan Daviss and Rudy Pankow are all slated to return after their suspenseful treasure hunt in previous seasons. This season is set to be much of the same, with exciting twists and turns and a group of high school teenagers played by a cast in their late-20s.
So, whether you pick up any of these titles, old re-watches or are continuing with the weekly released “Poker Face” on Peacock or “The Last of Us” on HBO Max, do remember to turn on a great watch to distract from semester stress.

The students of North Shore High School are moving on. 
On Sunday, the touring cast of Tina Fey’s musical rendition of “Mean Girls” closed at the Pantages Theater after a month’s worth of iconic phrases, pink outfits and so-called “plastic” sixteen-year-old girls singing their hearts out. 
Tina Fey, who played Ms. Norbury in the original movie, did a great job sticking to the plot. Fans could predict when characters were about to say familiar lines like “That’s so fetch” and “That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of secrets.” Some differences still allowed the pink-wearing audience to stay on the edge of their seats. 
Aside from adding new hilarious lines like “Honey, I know you’re not happy with your body right now but remember, real beauty comes from the face,” said by Mrs. George to comfort her weight-obsessed daughter, Fey also modernized some parts of the show from the 2004 movie. But it was the songs alone that made a real difference. 
In the movie, the audience first meets the protagonist Cady Heron when she says goodbye to her parents while getting dropped off at her new high school. But, in the musical, actress English Bernhardt introduced Cady’s character by singing “It Roars” while saying goodbye to the only home she knew — the Kenyan wilderness. This song was a fun way to amplify Cady’s attachment to Kenya in a more in-depth way than the movie.  
Shortly after Cady arrived at North Shore, the characters Janis and Damian introduced the school’s different social groups with the song “Where Do You Belong?” This number took place in the school cafeteria, and the choreography was phenomenal. The tables were constantly rotating around the stage like a Lazy Susan, with the spotlight on different friend groups as they were mentioned in the song. 
Then in the second act, the character Regina George sang “World Burn,” which embellished her wicked character traits. The clever song’s minor key and vile lyrics portrayed Regina’s character as more of a villain than the movie ever had. 
A low point of the show came from the musical version’s amputation of “Jingle Bell Rock,” when the number was cut short after a few lyrics due to an outfit malfunction. The number could have been an exciting way to make the audience feel like they were truly at the North Shore High holiday show. Still, the playwrights omitted the one musical number from the original film. 
Aside from the addition of music to “Mean Girls,” it was also refreshing to see Regina played by brunette Nadina Hassan since in the movie her character associates the stereotypical blonde beauty standard with popularity and wealth. Aside from Regina, other characters were portrayed more diversely than in the film. The two different “plastics,” Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith, are played by Black actresses Jasmine Rogers and Morgan Ashley Bryant. 
This diverse cast was certainly a plus of the show’s 2018 version. However, there were some elements of this modernization that were off-putting. There were references to emojis and Snapchat that did not add anything to the storyline. Frequent random technology references are unnecessary and the production’s age shows much faster than they should as technology evolves so quickly.
The technology-reliant sets detracted from the magic of live theater. While there were a few large physical props, such as Regina’s princess-like bed, the escalator at the mall, the mall’s fountain/“watering hole” and the student’s desks, digital screens made up the entirety of the backdrops and merely changed for each scene. These screens gave set designers the flexibility to create detailed and fast-changing sets, but they also eliminated the creativity of authentically-built backdrops. The screens also made the musical feel more like a movie and less like a show, especially from seats that were farther back. 
Still, regardless of these flaws, “Mean Girls” was worth watching. It is fantastic to see well-known movies being converted into musicals and keeping musical theater alive.

I am in the wildest love-hate relationship I’ve ever known with words. Of course, I’m here — writing this piece at 2 a.m. when I desperately need at least one night of quality sleep — because of the love part of the relationship.
I read a book for the first time when I was just two years old. According to what’s become a greatly-referenced legend of my childhood, my grandmother gifted me a copy of “Go Away, Big Green Monster!” by Ed Emberley for Christmas — a story my parents were certain I had never seen before. Unprompted, I sat down and started to read aloud as everyone’s mouths fell agape. 
I’m not telling this story to brag about my language abilities as an infant, but to show just how intuitive words were for me from the start. 
Ever since “Go Away, Big Green Monster!” the written word has been my primary method of expression — it’s where I’m most comfortable. Speaking was a different story, and this is where the hate side of the relationship comes in. 
No matter how hard I try, I can never make my brain run at an efficient speed. I’m either bouncing off the walls — interrupting people and embarrassingly oversharing — or am unable to form a coherent thought because my head is quite literally empty. 
But when I write, there are rules to follow that guide me out of the chaos in my mind. I can see when too many commas turn a sentence into a run-on, unlike when my meaningless ramblings dissipate without a clear conclusion. I know when I’m too far away from the minimum word count, instead of realizing after the fact that I didn’t take up nearly enough space in a conversation. 
Every haphazard word I say, I can’t take back. There’s no handy undo button. It’ll be part of the person’s perception of me forever — something I know I should care a lot less about. Instead, writing is beautifully impermanent. I can write a sentence as many times as I need to ensure it has the right tone, rhythm and vocabulary. Even though I seem to lack the ability to edit my spoken words in real time, I can change the punctuation or capitalization of a text to come across exactly as I intend to. 
While I by no means think these struggles are unique, the universe decided to concoct me a delectable mental illness cocktail — ADHD and a sprinkle (but like, a slip of the hand sprinkle that turns into more of a pour) of anxiety — that I rarely go a day without thinking about in my never-ending and perpetually-repetitive cycle of thoughts. 
The summer before my sophomore year, I finally learned the ingredients of this cocktail, which (long story short) led me to seriously consider dropping out of USC. I had the impossible task of coming to terms with the fact that, for 19 years, I tried to fit my square-pegged self into a world that’s a circular hole. A world of constant deadlines, where fast replies to text messages are imperative to maintaining relationships, where I’m expected to have substantive contributions to class discussions — none of which ever has, nor probably ever will, come easily to me. 
That fateful summer, I turned back to the written word and started journaling every chance I got. Something about turning my jumbled cloud of thoughts into a tangible product brought clarity like no other. Seeing these big feelings written into simple sentences made me realize that maybe my problems aren’t so unique and daunting, and that I can actually do something about them other than let them linger and build up inside of me. 
When I decided that I’d return to USC for at least one more semester to give it a fair chance, the written word was still there for me. I wasn’t even sure if I still wanted to pursue journalism, but reporting on important issues that fall reminded me why I fell in love with it in the first place. Journalism, like journaling, is the act of taking overwhelming current events and putting the intense emotions that come with them into words for people. It’s a reminder that we aren’t alone in this oftentimes discouraging world. 
Eventually, the written word led me here — as the managing editor of the Daily Trojan — writing this piece and sharing things that I never in a million years thought I’d share with the public. If you had told me even two years ago that I’d be here, I wouldn’t have believed you. And even though my future is terrifyingly uncertain right now, I have faith that somehow words will be there, guiding me. 
But for now, I’ll keep putting my overwhelming thoughts on a page, for myself and anyone else who happens to be reading. Just don’t ask me to talk about them. 
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world. Jenna Peterson is the managing editor of the Daily Trojan.

One of the biggest things that caught my attention during orientation was USC’s free Lyft program that allowed students to travel beyond the confines of campus — whether that be to get a ride home after dark or to run to USC Village or Ralphs for groceries. In such a densely-populated city with subpar public transportation, it eased both my mom’s mind and my own to have access to safe, convenient transportation as a freshman with only a skateboard to get around. Even though it was just within a one-to-two-mile radius, Fryft has saved me from having to walk home in the dark at 1 a.m. after Daily Trojan production.
However, Fryft freshman year was not as ideal or as comfortable as I thought it was. From being split up from my friends to being harassed with comments and questions from strangers, the free Lyft program followed a shared ride model that picked up other riders based on “route, destination and vehicle size,” according to a Daily Trojan news article. Nonetheless, the program still came in clutch on days where I needed to get home from the Village. It was nothing like the catastrophe that is the current Lyft model.
On Jan. 6, USC reestablished a shared Lyft model after it was initially discarded due to coronavirus concerns in Spring 2022. Despite much protesting and concerns from students, the University chose to move forward with a haphazard plan that is putting students in danger, amongst other issues. Ironically, coronavirus concerns still persist with the University continuing to send out daily coronavirus cases, a new variant popping up and the coronavirus still being a leading cause of death, hospitalization and severe illness.
In looking at the situation blankly from the University’s perspective, it might seem like students are just complaining to complain — the “University of Spoiled Children” once again 
finding inconveniences in a complimentary program. But if administration were to take a step in students’ shoes, they would find Trojans waiting up to 45 minutes for a ride and with the sun setting around 6 p.m. (the program’s start time), students are waiting in the cold darkness, often alone. Whether or not students are on campus, waiting this long to get home poses valid safety concerns that the University seems to dismiss. The program and the University have hit a new low, and bus schedules in L.A. are more consistent and reliable at this point.
One of my recent shared Lyft experiences had me in a car with two random people. It took almost 15 minutes to travel 0.8 miles (it took 10 for the driver to even pick me up). 
In another instance, after waiting over 20 minutes for a one-mile ride that never got picked up, I finally bit the bullet and paid $16 for a driver, an option not all students possess. 
The list of grievances surrounding the shared Lyft program has continued to grow among USC’s student body, and for good reason. Free, personal rides that would’ve normally taken two to five minutes to arrive have now been replaced by inconsistent trips with strangers that seemingly never arrive in under 30 minutes. 
While USC saves money through the program, drivers are putting in more effort for less money. USC already saved money by switching from a shuttle service to a partnership with Lyft, as operational costs decreased by 40% within nine months from the start of the program. Meanwhile drivers have to navigate a new system that has them constantly picking up and dropping off riders all for a lesser wage. 
Beyond inconvenience, getting into a car with strangers poses many problems. Students do not know who will enter the Lyft with them or who they find themselves riding with. An intoxicated student could be put into a car with ill-willed individuals. Someone who’s leaving or arriving at their home has inadvertently disclosed that information to the random people they’re riding with. With coronavirus protocols dissipating, masks becoming less common and the uncertainty of whether or not someone is sick, the concern of getting sick still persists, especially when you share a ride.
Students often use the program because it’s all they have. Those with disabilities may not have the resources to wait an hour, pay extra money for a private ride or travel longer distances for public transportation just to get home. 
Despite the University claiming to be vehemently focused on accessibility, student well-being and campus safety, it seems we have found ourselves once again asking the University, “How much is a student’s safety worth?” Rather than cutting corners or inflating a football coach’s salary, maybe it’s time to put students first as we all know the University has more than enough funding to provide.
