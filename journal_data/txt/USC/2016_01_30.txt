There are many adjectives which first-generation college students may use to describe themselves: fearless, proud and revolutionary are just some of them. For me, being a first-generation student means not only taking on the role of a leader in my own community but also challenging the ideals that have for a very long time been keeping many of us out of higher education. 
The challenges for a first-generation college student are many. First of all, there is the financial aspect of higher education. At USC, there are grants and scholarships that can help one offset these costs. Even then, however, from my experience talking with my fellow classmates, this help is not enough to truly make us feel like the rest of our more privileged classmates. While the majority of our classmates have their parents’ financial support, some of us do not have that luxury simply because our parents cannot afford to do such or we do not want to place another financial burden on them. As a result, a great majority of my first generation classmates work in order to pay for school. This is not unusual or unexpected; however, this does create two inadvertent consequences that will affect students’ futures.
The first consequence is that a college student who works may not be able to allocate enough time working on homework, writing an essay or studying for exams. This can affect that student’s grades. The second, which I believe is more impactful, is that the student will not be able to create the connections or gain the necessary experience to advance his or her career. While this may not always be true, it certainly is for a great number of students. 
Another barrier for first-generation college students is feeling alone in pursuing our dreams and aspirations. Certainly, there are many organizations out there to help alleviate these feelings of insecurity, such as SWAG To College, for which I am currently a mentor. However, it is clear that more needs to be done. At USC specifically, I believe there should be more support for first-generation students like myself so that we may be able to feel more comfortable with these new surroundings. I am looking forward to the day when there is a legacy of college attendance in minority families such as my own. When that day comes we as a society would have truly taken a step forward in educational equity and opened the doors for many more to shape the future of this country.
There should be a first generation club on campus. If there isn’t, start one. Studies show that first generation students success most when they have: 1) other first generation students (particularly ones who are one or two grade levels above them) helping them; 2) tutoring centers to catch up and fill in any gaps they have in math, writing or other skills; 3) mentors; 4) professors they can keep in touch with. They found that the first two are the most important.

Like it was four weeks ago, the Trojans held a double-digit lead in the second half over Washington. And again, the Huskies made a push to trim the Trojans’ advantage.
But unlike January 3rd in Seattle, the Men of Troy were able to weather the Huskies’ push and come away with a 98-88 victory at Galen Center Saturday afternoon.
Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic led the way with 28 points on 10-of-13 shooting while sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin chipped in 21 points, making 5-of-10 shots.
The Huskies made a run to cut into the Trojans’ lead to start the second half, cutting the 11-point lead down to three after a couple of transition baskets.
But USC answered with a run of its own, scoring on eight of its next nine possessions. Jovanovic continued to score inside and a 3-pointer by McLaughlin helped regain a double-digit advantage for the Trojans at 72-61 midway through the second half.
“We just remained poised,” McLaughlin said. “We understood what we went through when we were up there [at Washington]. Yesterday in practice we worked on our press break, coming back to the ball and helping out whoever was getting pressed. We really emphasized all the mistakes we had up there.”
After Washington trimmed the lead down to two possessions with under four minutes to play, USC clamped down on defense, holding the Huskies to just two field goals the rest of the way. Jovanovic’s putback layup gave USC a 93-82 lead with just over a minute to play.
The junior’s 28 points was a season-high and he did most of his damage in the paint against a Washington team that struggles with defensive rebounds. The Trojans had 18 offensive rebounds to the Huskies’ 12.
“We knew we could attack the defensive glass and hurt them over there, and that’s what we did,” Jovanovic said.
Head coach Andy Enfield noted that he did not do anything special to call attention to Jovanovic.
“Nikola is extremely talented and skilled,” Enfield said. “He played within himself tonight. Made some moves, and was able to get to the rim and finish. There’s nothing we did to say, ‘Go out and score 28 points.’ We just said, ‘Go play your game and have some fun.’”
The Trojans used a 17-5 run to pull ahead late in the first half, as they were prolific from 3-point range. It took USC nearly 12 minutes to knock down its first triple when sophomore guard Elijah Stewart put the Trojans up 23-20. But the Men of Troy made three of their next four shots from distance, and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright’s connection at the 4:39 mark of the first half gave USC its first double-digit lead of the afternoon at 36-24.
Jovanovic finished off the half with two pretty layups – one in traffic after a series of pump fakes and the second on a controlled take to the rim with the shot clock winding down.
The Huskies, meanwhile, were held to just three field goals in the final eight minutes of the first half as the Trojans took a 44-33 lead into halftime.
Washington’s star senior guard Andrew Andrews, who leads the Pac-12 in scoring at 21.3 points per game, had a subpar afternoon with just 15 points on 3-of-14 shooting as the Trojans were able to limit his driving ability.
“It helped a lot,” McLaughlin said on the strategy against Andrews. “Without him being as effective and getting to the rack, it helped us in a major way.”
Boatwright scored five quick points early on for USC, which jumped out to a 9-6 four minutes into the game. Boatwright, who finished with 15 points, was one of five Trojans who scored in double figures along with Katin Reinhardt, Jovanovic, McLaughlin, Reinhardt and Stewart.
“We’ve been able to pick each other up,” Enfield said on the scoring balance. “If [certain] players have off nights, their teammates have been able to carry the scoring load and make plays. We don’t have anyone [like Andrew Andrews] who’s going to score 20 or 25 points a night. We have extremely talented offensive players. They share the ball. They bought in to making the extra pass. We lead the [Pac-12] in assists because we’re sharing the basketball.”
The Men of Troy surely entered the game with the Jan. 3 loss at Washington on their minds. USC fell 87-85 to the Huskies on the road after blowing a 22-point second half lead.
“It was a big learning experience for us,” Jovanovic said. “We were excited for this matchup. We prepared really well.”
The Trojans improve to 17-5 and 6-3 in conference play, and are now just a half game out of first in the Pac-12. They also remain undefeated at home with a 13-0 record at Galen Center.
Both teams entered Saturday on hot streaks; USC had won four of its last six games while Washington had won three of four, including a comeback win at UCLA Thursday.
The Trojans were coming off a comfortable 81-71 win over Washington State Thursday night following a pair of losses in Oregon last weekend.
They have four days off before taking on UCLA at Galen Center in a crosstown showdown next Thursday.
