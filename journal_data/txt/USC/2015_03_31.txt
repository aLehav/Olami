Students for Justice in Palestine hosted Rana Sharif, a gender studies professor at Loyola Marymount University and an activist for the conflict in Palestine, for a discussion about the current state of Palestine and how a major issue of concern for the future of the country lies within the topic of creating women’s rights.
Sharif is a member of the Southern California Palestinian American Women’s Association, which seeks to empower the lives of Arab-American women and children.
Her talk was part of the USC Palestine Awareness Week that takes place every spring.
Nashwah Akhtar, a second-year graduate student of public diplomacy and the organizer for the event, explained her motives for inviting Sharif to come and speak to USC students.
“Both are human rights issues that need to be addressed and as a student I try to find any avenue I can to be an activist and supporter for the marginalized,” she said.
During the talk, Sharif focused on organizing movements that have emerged in Palestine from 1920 to the present. She divided the time frame in three by addressing the different types of women’s movements that have emerged in the past few decades.
Sharif specifically addressed the movements that occurred during the British Mandate period.
“During this period, women organized themselves formally starting organizations such as the Arab Women’s Union,” Sharif said. “They also worked alongside their male counterparts, participated in demonstrations and delivered speeches to the British government.”
She then described the period after 1948 when the nation state was established. Sharif described how women retreated and established organizations such as the Arab Child Welfare House and the Red Crescent Society.
Today, Sharif says that women’s activism has moved to utilize more advanced forms of technology.
“Internet offers women a rejuvenated way to engage in activism,” she said.
During the discussion, various topics regarding women’s issues in Palestine were addressed. Students discussed the difficulty of transportation within Palestine and how it affects women’s health.
“Women are denied access to hospitals at Israeli checkpoints and are forced to give birth at checkpoints, often at the expense of both their lives and their newborns’ lives,” Akhtar said.
John-Peter Jupiter, a sophomore majoring in critical studies, expressed why he considered this issue important to him.
“It’s important to be involved because of the general sense of ‘let’s not talk about it’ and because of USC’s interest in settlements,” he said.
After the event was over, many students stayed to engage in personal conversations.
Akhtar said that she was content with the outcome of the talk.
“I’m really happy about how the talk went and … about the discussion that resulted afterwards,” she said.
Sharif encouraged students to participate in Palestine awareness events.
“Palestine is such a hot topic that the only way for students to feel comfortable is for them to attend events like these or the events of Palestine Awareness Week that allow for conversations like these,” she said.
She closed the event by explaining that the discussion period fostered a time for students to bring up their concerns and to address controversial topics in a respectful manner.
“Our discussion was probably the best, probably even better than the conversation. Conversations like these allow students to bring up their issues and concerns and whatever questions they might have and then have a cognizant conversation where we can create a community where all of our differences can be respected,” Sharif said.
Zionists are deflecting in these comments. Hamas does not train children. They’re problematic, absolutely, but very clearly a product of six decades of Israeli settler colonialism and brutality, repeated/continued displacement, grave human rights violations against indigenous Palestinians, and Israeli imposed instability. Not to mention, they’re largely powerless compared to Israel’s aggressive military. Zionists can’t endorse and justify their murder of children and expect no resistance. The root of the problem is Zionism. It’s a bigoted political movement and Israel is a settler colonial project. Like every settler colonial project, it destroys and seeks to replace indigenous people and places. No one can claim to care about any social justice platform with an ounce of integrity without this recognition. Nor can anyone intelligently claim to want peace without recognizing the deep suffering the Palestinian people have endured. 
How about freedom for Hamas to train thousands of their children to be murderers and suicide bombers? That is important, too, right? You don’t believe it? Do a search. Hamas is very proud of this barbaric program.
Oh yes, women are treated so poorly at Israeli checkpoints. No specific mention of the treatment within Gaza. The lack of perspective to me here is simply mind-boggling. No accountability among Palestinian activists. All self-victimization and demonization of Israel. Dear Daily Trojan. Do better.

The social community club, HapaSC, is repurposing the question of race and ethnicity to allow students of mixed ethnicities to define themselves in their own terms.
HapaSC is hosting The Hapa Project on Trousdale Parkway from March 31 to April 2 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to open up conversations about stereotypes and foster respectful conversations about race.
Students can take pictures and write their own definition of who they are on the picture.
Jamie Kwong, communications manager of HapaSC, sees the pictures as a platform for those with a multicultural background to define themselves.
“People should be able to define themselves and not have to be asked what they are,” Kwong said.  “It’s important on such a diverse campus to kind of include the third race into all that goes on at USC already.”
The Hapa photo book, created by the artist Kip Fulbeck, inspired Aly Tsui, the president of HapaSC, and Elisabeth Gilmore, vice president, to bring the Hapa Project to USC.
Fulbeck began the project in 2001 to photograph over 1,200 volunteers throughout the nation who identify as Hapa. HapaSC saw the effect the project had and wanted to replicate that effect at USC.
Tsui said that there are many ways to define yourself and there is no right or wrong answer.
“When people ask you ‘what are you?’ there are so many ways that you can respond that may or may not be what they’re looking for,” Tsui said.
“By doing it in a way like this we’re giving the student the power to find out themselves,” Gilmore said.
As a club dedicated to inclusivity, HapaSC was created to connect multiracial students and to create an environment where members can openly discuss what being multiethnic means to them.
“I think [the purpose of HapaSC is] having a community like this on campus where those people that kind of fit into this, kind of fit into that, but don’t really fit in to either, can come and have a place to call home,” Kwong said.
HapaSC was formed to create a safe space for multicultural students to discuss their experiences.
“Friendship is something we really want to focus on because I think the friendship level is where barriers start to get broken down,” Gilmore said. “It’s also about raising awareness for people of how to be more respectful when talking about those types of things, or also acknowledging that it even exists.  I think a lot of people categorize it that they’re so exotic or cool but, it’s still an ‘other’ not an ‘us.’”
Each week HapaSC focuses on different ethnic mixes to break down barriers between ethnicities.  The goal is to create a collective consciousness to beat the identity crisis, as students of mixed ethnicities are sometimes pressured to choose between one of their identities.
“I think most people that come from a unitary race background don’t necessarily comprehend what it’s like to grow up with two very distinct cultures. It is a really interesting experience growing up because you’re constantly balancing obligations and expectations from two sides of your family or maybe even more than that,” Tsui said.
HapaSC serves as a resource for multicultural students to explore their mixed backgrounds and experiences, discuss the growing presence of multicultural people in society and provide service opportunities catered to serving those in the Hapa community.
“We want to address a segment of society that is not talked about as much and is not really given the credit it necessarily deserves,” Tsui said.

Undergraduate Student Government swore in 2015-2016 President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler along with student senators Tuesday night.
Also sworn in were commuter senators Cassandra Aguayo, Jacob Ellenhorn and Bulk Lao. Greek senators were Chris Fong, Darian Nourian and Sanjay Mahboobani; residential senators were Sabrina Enriquez, Alec White, Aaron Rifkind, Dan Li, Eric Dubbery and Guiseppe Robalino.
After the ceremony, Sampath gave an inauguration speech to students and visitors present.
“I dreamt of the day I would stand before you as USC’s student body president,” Sampath said. “In fact, I dreamt so much of this day I was watching the USG president debate videos prior to my admission … Some would call it overeager, but at least my dad calls that passionate.”
Sampath proceeded to express her gratitude the various members of USG that worked alongside her during her term as USG vice president. She thanked the incoming senators, her running mate Fowler and her family. She also thanked her dad for teaching her the “value of dreaming big,” her mother for her support and sister for still thinking of Sampath as “invincible.”
Sampath also gave an overview for her upcoming plans.
“I believe this new year marks an opportunity to show our student body that student government is their channel to make an impact,” Sampath said. “I believe it is an opportunity to show our student body how student government is their ally. I know that continuing to restore students’ faith in student government takes work; I know that it takes sleepless night and relentless devotion. We’re prepared for that.”
Sampath concluded her speech referencing one of this year’s Super Bowl commercials. In the advertisement, Sampath said, actress Mindy Kaling tries to hail a taxi to no avail. A voice over then comes on to say, “After years of being treated like she was invisible, it occurred to Mindy Kaling she might actually be invisible.” Sampath likened the message of this commercial to the situation of many USC students.
“Students have shared with me the feeling of a disconnect between our student body and our senior administration,” Sampath said. “Sexual assault survivors, students with mental health issues, transfer students, my peers from low-income families, members of the queer community, no matter who you are or where you come from, Jordan and I and the rest of our team are here to listen, to empathize, to understand, to learn and to make your Trojan experience the best that it can be.”
After the speech and the following meeting with the new officials, Aziz Akbari, now a former residential senator, reflected on his year working in the USG Senate.
“It feels bittersweet [to be leaving],” Akbari said. “I think today we ended on a very good note. Today we got two resolutions passed, so it was a great way to end the year. But I’m sad to leave.”
Akbari expressed no regrets during his time at USG but said that he wished he would have had more time to develop certain projects. However, he has worked closely with the incoming senators and knows that they will continue developing.
“I’m really happy. I got three resolutions passed in the past three weeks,” Akbari said. “I’m really pumped because the work that we’re doing is just getting started.”
Aaron Rifkind, a newly sworn in residential senator,  then discussed some of his future USG plans.
“I’m gonna be working a lot with [Darian Nourian]. He’s working really hard to revamp the Lyon Center and I’m going to help him [allocate] more funding,” Rifkind said. “One of my personal goals is to increase the hospitality options on campus. I know that the freshman dining halls are mostly for freshmen even though they cater to the larger student body.”
Editor’s note: Darian Nourian is the sports editor of the Daily Trojan.

Following two big wins this past weekend over conference rivals, the men’s volleyball team looks to carry its momentum into Malibu on Thursday when the Trojans visit Pepperdine. The rematch between the Trojans and the Waves will help shape the final standings in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference heading into the postseason.
The No. 8 Trojans (14-7, 12-6 MPSF) currently sit in fourth place in the MPSF standings, one spot behind the No. 3 Waves (19-4, 14-4). The Trojans defeated Pepperdine earlier this season at home on Jan. 16 in four sets. USC came into that game as the No. 8 team in the country according to the American Volleyball Coaches Association national poll, upsetting the then-No. 2 Waves.
Both teams have already clinched spots in the MPSF tournament and would play first round games at home the way it stands. USC could possibly earn an easier matchup in the second round of the tournament by leapfrogging Pepperdine in the standings, however. Additionally, USC could lose its spot in fourth place and have to travel for the first round if it does not close out the season strong.
The Trojans have four remaining games in conference play as well as one non-conference match before the end of the regular season. In front of the Trojans in the standings are No. 1 Hawai’i (20-3, 15-2), No. 5 UC Irvine (20-4, 14-3) then the Waves. Behind the Trojans are No. 9 UC Santa Barbara (15-8, 10-8), No. 6 BYU (13-8, 10-8), No. 10 Long Beach State (13-11, 9-10) and No. 12 UCLA (11-10, 7-10). The Trojans could finish first in the standings and are guaranteed to finish at least seventh.
The top eight teams in the 12-team conference qualify for the conference tournament, which determines the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The Trojans qualified for the tournament last season as the eighth seed but were knocked out by first seed and eventual conference champion BYU in the first round. They did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
It’s been an up-and-down season for the Trojan, but recent victories indicate that the team might finally be getting back to playing at its full potential.
The Trojans opened the season at 7-0 overall and 6-0 in MPSF play, climbing as high as No. 2 in the AVCA national poll. The Trojans then dropped seven of their next 11 matches, including four in a row in conference, and the Trojans nearly fell out of the AVCA top 10. But since then, the Trojans have won three MPSF matches in a row and don’t have any opponents left on their schedule who have beaten them this year.
After beating Long Beach State over spring break, the team took down UC Santa Barbara and UCLA last weekend at home. All three of the last wins went to five sets, marking the ninth time the Trojans have gone the distance in a match and the seventh time they’ve emerged victorious. Head coach Bill Ferguson said the number of high-intensity matches the team has played this year should pay off down the road.
“As we’ve been trying to find ourselves, it’s good that we keep getting in these battles,” he said.
Ferguson said the key for the team’s win over UCLA was good passing. He said that the team’s middle blockers — sophomore Andy Benesh, junior Tommy Leonard and senior Robert Feathers — were all hitting particularly well, and the team just needed to make sure senior setter Micah Christenson received good passes so he could set up the attack from the middle.
“Tommy, Robert and Andy had fantastic numbers, we just weren’t passing the ball well enough to get them the ball, and that’s credit to UCLA’s serving,” he said. “[But] I thought we picked up the passing.”
Junior libero Brooks Varni agreed, saying the offense is in good hands with Christenson and the array of Trojan hitters if he and the other passers can do their jobs.
“It’s about letting Micah do his thing, he’s the best in the world,” he said. “We just have to get it in his general vicinity.”
Varni said after the win over UCLA that the team finally got out of its midseason funk by playing with more energy.
“We’re playing really hard and we’re having fun,” he said. “That’s the most important thing that kind of gets lost in all this.”
Ferguson said it was crucial for the team to perform well during this part of the season, not only to earn a home court playoff match but also to ensure that the team is playing at its highest level going into playoffs.
“We just want to be playing good volleyball going into April,” he said. “We know that we’ve got to be good in April.”
The Trojans and the Waves will start on Thursday at 7 p.m.

The SportsCenter Top 10 plays list is one of the ultimate pinnacles in all of sports. In fact, if I had to list the 10 things I would want to accomplish in sports if I were an elite athlete, making ESPN’s Top 10 list would definitely be one of them — somewhere between striking out Barry Bonds and getting my name engraved on the Stanley Cup.
So when I read in the press release from earlier this year that the new offensive coordinator for the USC women’s lacrosse team had once graced that trademark ESPN segment as a player, I knew she was legit.
She’s Alyssa Leonard, a former star from the Northwestern women’s lacrosse dynasty, who snuck in at No. 10 on the list with a brilliant behind-the-back shot.
But the most impressive parts? She scored it against USC. And only four months before being hired to coach the school she just schooled. The highlight occurred on April 26 last year, when the Wildcats took down the Women of Troy 12-7, during Leonard’s senior season. By late August, she was hired to be a part of USC’s staff.
It’s not unusual for USC women’s lacrosse coaches to come from Northwestern, the powerhouse that has won seven national championships since 2005. USC’s head coach Lindsey Munday hails from Northwestern, as did Hilary Bowen, the former offensive coordinator for whom Leonard took over. If the goal is to be the best, you might as well learn from the best.
While USC lacrosse is still a couple years from breaking into the upper echelon of national programs, the team has made tremendous progress in only its third competitive season. This year is no exception, as the Women of Troy look like legitimate contenders for a conference championship and an NCAA tournament bid.
The 2015 season has featured a seven-game winning streak for the Women of Troy, a program record. The streak included three wins over Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rivals, propelling the team into second place in the conference standings — San Diego State, which hosts the Women of Troy on the last day of the season, sits in first at 4-0.
The seven-game winning streak was sandwiched by three tough losses. The Women of Troy open the season against none other than Northwestern inside the Coliseum. USC nearly shocked the lacrosse world and had the Wildcats trailing by seven goals at the start of the game. Northwestern rallied to tie the game in regulation, however, and ultimately pull out a 12-11 win in overtime. The heartbreaking comeback was followed by a tough 7-4 loss at Stony Brook, USC’s worst offensive output of the season. The seven-game winning streak started after the Stony Brook loss and ended this Monday at Boston College after USC fell to the Eagles 16-12.
There’s obviously still room for improvement for the team. No. 6 Northwestern, No. 9 Stony Brook and No. 3 BC are the only three ranked teams USC has played this year. Despite the seven-game winning streak, the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association national poll does not have the Women of Troy in the Top 20 because of their struggles against ranked opponents. But the overall performance of the team over the season shows noticeable improvement both from last season and as a program in general.
Though the old saying goes that close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, I think there is something to be said about the fact that USC has played some of the best teams in the country competitively.
The Northwestern game in particular shows the potential of the club, even though part of that can likely be attributed to a slow start by the Wildcats in their season opener on the road. Compared to the last time Northwestern faced USC in the Coliseum, when the Wildcats won 18-5 two years ago during USC’s first game in program history, it’s obvious that the program has come a long way in just those three short seasons.
The overall numbers on the season also tell an important story about the progress of the team. Not only are the Women of Troy close in games that they’ve lost, but they’re also dominating in games that they’ve won.
The Women of Troy are averaging 13.3 goals per game, more than two points better than the 11.5 averaged the year before. USC is also holding opponents to only 7.7 goals a game, about another two-goal improvement from the 9.6 goals a game surrendered last year.
The toughest part of the MPSF schedule still remains for the Women of Troy. The three teams to beat USC in conference play last year — Colorado, Denver and Oregon — all have yet to play USC this year. Additionally, USC’s matchup with Stanford, the one ranked MPSF team, is set for later next month.
But the Women of Troy look to be in good position to finish in at least sixth place in the conference standings and make the MPSF tournament. The Women of Troy were bounced in the first round of the tournament last year but look capable of running with every team in the conference this year. Winning the tournament would earn USC its first ever NCAA tournament bid, which would be another huge step forward for the national reputation of the program. The Women of Troy are absolutely heading in the right direction, and it’s only a matter of time before they get there. This year’s team still needs to prove it can finish against the best competition for it to be a possibility this season, but the potential to do so definitely seems to be there.
Like any program, the eventual goal of the team is to legitimately compete for national titles every year. USC has the resources to do so, as well as arguably the best coaching staff in the county.
Munday and Leonard both won two national championships as players at Northwestern, with Munday adding another three as an assistant coach for the Wildcats, so they know what it takes to get there. As cool as seeing herself on SportsCenter must have been, I can bet those two national championship rings rank just a little higher on Leonard’s Top 10 career sports accomplishments.

After a road trip to Arizona, where the No. 1 Women of Troy volleyball team won all three matches, they return home for a matchup on Thursday against Loyola Marymount and Concordia in Merle Norman Stadium.
The Women of Troy continued their hot start to the season by improving their overall record to 12-0. In Arizona, the Women of Troy only dropped one point in their duals against New Mexico, Grand Canyon and Arizona State. Last week, the Women of Troy played six matches in just five days, but they finally had a short rest.
Head coach Anna Collier took full advantage of the break that her team received.
“The team had a day off on Monday and then went to the beach for some strength and conditioning on Tuesday,” said Collier. “We did much easier workouts so that we are resting and relaxing.”
So far this season the Women of Troy have been led by their   No. 1 pairing of Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes, as well the No. 3 pair of Meg Norton and Eve Ettinger. Sophomore Kelly Claes already has amassed 31 blocks while her partner Hughes has 174 kills on the season. With the third pair, Norton already has 151 kills and is hitting over .400. Ettinger, on the other hand, had 9 kills on just 14 swings against Cal State Bakersfield. These two pairings have been crucial to the Women of Troy’s success.
The No. 9 Loyola Marymount return back to USC for the second time this season and are hoping for a better outcome. In their first matchup, the Women of Troy won easily with a 4-1 victory, however, the No. 1 for USC of Claes and sophomore Sara Hughes were upset by the Lions’ No. 1 pairing of senior Betsi Metter and freshman Sarah Sponcil.
The Lions have struggled this season going on 2-6 so far and their two wins came against Pacific and Cal State Bakersfield. Though the team might be struggling, Metter and Sponcil have an overall record of                 13-3, while the rest of team has an overall record of 15-44.
Even though this hasn’t been the best season for Loyola Marymount, they are still extremely dangerous and are looking for a big upset against the Women of Troy.
The other opponent that the Women of Troy will face is the Concordia Eagles. The Eagles are in their first year of existence, and this will be the first match they play this season against USC. Several of their indoor players will be playing for the sand team for their offseason workout. Their head coach Kari Pestolesi is also the assistant coach for the indoor team.
The Women of Troy will have a height advantage against the Eagles as many of their players are 6 feet and under. The No. 1 pair for the Eagles are junior Marissa Boyd and freshman Rachel Flynn. With so much unknown about the Eagles, Collier isn’t taking any risks.
“I don’t really know anything about this team, but we are going to do what we always do and take care of our side of the court,” said Collier.
The first dual match on Thursday will begin at 1:30 p.m. against Loyola Marymount followed by another match at 3 p.m. against Concordia.

So you think you can dance?
The football team was back inside the Coliseum yesterday — rather than Cromwell Field — for yesterday’s spring practice. In the spirit of training to perform in front of a crowd, the middle of practice featured a special performance that wasn’t exactly related to football.
Coach Steve Sarkisian interrupted practice midway through the day for a team dance off. Each unit of the team selected a representative to break it down in front of the rest of the team.
Sarkisian said it was a chance to “break up the monotony” of practice and have some fun. He told the players after the dance off that they need to be able know when to have fun and when to get serious and go back to working hard.
Sarkisian added that freshman offensive lineman Roy Hemsley had the most impressive moves on the team. He even took to Twitter to announce “I’m declaring @leagueme_roy the dance-off winner.”
Can’t stick with Steven
Rising redshirt sophomore wide receiver Steven Mitchell arguably had the play of the day during practice. Mitchell caught a short screen pass and took it almost 50 yards for a touchdown.
He even caused rising sophomore corner back and last year’s Pac-12 freshman defensive player of the year Adoree’ Jackson to lose his footing while trying to make a tackle on the play.
Mitchell will likely see a much bigger role at receiver this upcoming season, especially after the departure of Nelson Agholor. The speedy Mitchell will likely see most of his snaps at the slot receiver position.
Mitchell had seven catches for 82 yards and two touchdowns last season. He started the last two games of the season but sprained his knee early in the Nebraska game. Mitchell, a Mission Hills Bishop Alemany product, missed all of his freshman season and redshirted in 2013 after tearing ligaments in his knee during summer practice.
Taking a stand
Sarkisian said he was standing behind Athletic Director Pat Haden’s decision not to attend a College Football Playoff selection committee meeting this week in Indianapolis.
“I support Pat Haden every step of the way,” Sarkisian said of Haden’s statement.
Haden announced that he was not going to attend the meeting to protest the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act that was signed into law in Indiana this week. Many have argued that the legislation is discriminatory to homosexuals. Haden has a gay son.
Haden also took to Twitter, writing this message: “I am the proud father of a gay son. In his honor, I will not be attending the CFP committee meeting in Indy this week. #EmbraceDiversity.” The tweet was retweeted over 6,000 times.
Elsewhere in college sports, the law has drawn criticism from NCAA President Mark Emmert. The NCAA is hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis, but Emmert has openly questioned whether the law will negatively affect participants in the tournament. Emmert has even acknowledged the possibility of moving future events out of the state if the law presents an issue.
“We’re very serious about our core values and we want to make sure we can operate in an environment that is supportive of those values,” he said in an interview with ESPN. “So this is a very serious issue for us.”

Sufjan Stevens’ new album, Carrie & Lowell, has been almost universally hailed as his best work and one of the best albums of the year, and if you think these reviews are exaggerating, you’ve never heard Sufjan Stevens.
The first time I heard Sufjan Stevens was on the soundtrack to Little Miss Sunshine, one of my favorite movies. His songs in the film serve perfectly to highlight the dysfunction and deep emotional stakes the main characters face, and since then, he has not stopped creating incredibly moving music. In 2010, on the album The Age of Adz, Stevens crafted an astonishing 25-minute song titled “Impossible Soul” that twists and turns and unravels like an orchestral piece in the 21st century. His music is unique, implementing the traditions and fables of countless cultures into his lyrics about his own personal life, and Stevens is the modern day torchbearer of the folk genre.
The Detroit native has been experimenting with his sound since he began his music career, but his newest work strips away the bells and whistles of his previous albums, leaving the young artist with a lot of emotion and simple compositions. Though the instrumentation on Carrie & Lowell is simple, Stevens’ lyrics are anything but. He talks about his family, his past and his life overall with heart-wrenchingly slow melodies and croons. The pace of this album is slow, but it is hauntingly beautiful.
“F-ck me, I’m falling apart,” sings Stevens in “No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,” the first single off his album. Pitchfork described this moment on the album as “the barest, most honest declaration you’ll hear on a record this year.” It is deep and soulful about the passing of his mother Carrie and expresses the hopelessness he felt during this time.
Carrie Brams was Sufjan’s mother, but she was not very present in his life, according to an interview the folk artist did with Pitchfork. He spent only a few years with her before she was out of his life, only showing up at the occasional holiday or in random places. They spent only three summers together in Oregon, which is where Stevens draws most of his memories of his mother. Though he believes Carrie could have been a great mother, her schizophrenia and depression made it impossible for her to be present in the artist’s life, leaving Stevens to wonder about who his mother really is.
“As a kid, of course, I had to construct some kind of narrative, so I’ve always had a strange relationship to the mythology of Carrie, because I have such few lived memories of my experience with her. There’s such a discrepancy between my time and relationship with her, and my desire to know her and be with her,” he said.
This album is the boiling over of Sufjan Stevens’ want to connect with his mother, now two years since her death. For this reason, there are sparse drums, and the album is devoid of anything that couldn’t be done by one person. Carrie & Lowell is Stevens’ most personal work, and as such it connects to the soul in a profound way. “Fourth of July” from this album is a conversation between Sufjan and Carrie, flowing from when she is on her deathbed onwards past her death, and it highlights both his despair and the hopefulness he received from his mother.
“The hospital asked should the body be cast/ Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky/ Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth,” sings Sufjan from his own perspective after his mother has died.
“Why do you cry?/ Make the most of your life, while it is rife/ While it is light,” he sings as his mother’s response. This hope is part of Stevens’ healing process, as most of the album most likely was. Sufjan Stevens is known for his complex allusions and word choices, but here he is being clear as day. There is no question of what he means when he sings, “We’re all gonna die” to both open and close the track. There is a comfort derived in this statement, as it alleviates the fear of death, leaving only life to be lived. Stevens said in his interview that he embarked on a journey of self-destruction after his mother’s death, as evidence in some of the song lyrics on Carrie & Lowell, but that he ultimately found some closure, which he then put into the above song.
“I quickly learned that you don’t have to be incarcerated by suffering, and that, in spite of the dysfunctional nature of your family, you are an individual in full possession of your life,” he said in the interview.
Carrie and Lowell is a compilation of the sufferings Sufjan Stevens went through after the death of his mother, and by sharing it with the world, he has allowed others to embark on a healing process similar to his own. His work is profound and visceral, and Carrie & Lowell is the perfect album to listen to if you want to truly be moved.

Already tired of campus just a few weeks after spring break? Are midterms, papers, and looming finals making you antsy for a change of scenery? Here are eight Instagram accounts to follow if you find yourself yearning for adventure. If you can suppress your urge to drop out of school and become a travel writer or vagabond while perusing these accounts, they can provide endless material for your travel daydreams.
@nytimestravel: The New York Times Travel section, a classic staple for aspiring globetrotters, goes digital with its social media account. The adventures of all the paper’s travel writers are compiled here, resulting in a diverse array of photos. On any given day, this account can take you from Chile to Italy to New Mexico. Many photos are also linked to corresponding stories, like the Times “36 Hours In…” series, providing even more virtual wandering.
@brendanvanson: A professional travel photographer and writer, Brendan van Son is living the dream, literally making money by traveling the world. His photos showcase not just landscapes and travel destinations, but the people he meets on his adventures. Photos of his recent trip to Colombia included one of a Gaucho as well as an image of a forest waterfall. A deeper look into Brendan’s account reveals photos from various locations, from oil rigs in Alberta, Canada to waterfalls in Arizona.
@andy_best: Many people travel to experience a new culture. Andy Best travels to get away from culture, and exclusively features outdoor destinations. With a bio that reads, “I show people the world that makes me happy with hopes they too are inspired.” A self-proclaimed “earth roamer,” Best’s account features images from backpacking, hiking, rafting and just general adventuring. You won’t find food photos from a five-star European restaurant or a crowded city skyline — just nature, in its purest state.
@dguttenfelder: North Korea obviously isn’t a travel destination, but with the country’s recent prominence in the media and the attention surrounding The Interview, you’ve got to be at least curious at what life in the secluded country really looks like. The Instagram of David Guttenfelder, National Geographic photographer, includes images of North Korean life from his stint as the Associated Press’s chief Asia photographer. Scroll back a few weeks for the acclaimed images or admire his recent photos of American life, including national parks.
@ourwildabandon We all dream of road tripping with our best friend but are usually held back by work, school and differing schedules. Besties Jill and Kyla from Vancouver actually made it happen and are showcasing their trip via Instagram. You can also read about their trip on their accompanying blog. Photos document a classic American road trip, with unique stops like Louisiana State Penitentiary rodeos and Arizona ghost towns.
@bipolaire61: If you’re dreaming of an exotic getaway, it doesn’t get much more exotic than Antarctica. This account mainly features photos of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, areas rarely visited by even the most accomplished travelers. And it’s not all March of the Penguins, though there are definitely plenty of penguin portraits. Photos include igloos, snowy beaches and stark landscapes. Sailing appears to be this photographer’s preferred mode of transportation, so tropical islands are mixed in among the white, frozen tundra.
@muradosmann: You’ve probably already seen Murad Osmann’s photos on the “trending” page of Instagram. Instead of focusing only on places themselves, Osmann frames each photo by featuring his girlfriend, reaching her hand back and holding his, in front of exotic locales. This spurred the hashtag “followmeto,” which now boasts nearly 2 hundred thousand photos. A little cheesy? Yes, but with over 200,000, Osmann has certainly established himself in the emerging niche of Instagram travel photographers.
@discoverLA: Sometimes we forget that we live in one of the tourist capitals of the world. Sure, the Walk of Fame is overrated, and you only need to see the Hollywood sign once, but if you’re seeking instant gratification to your travel cravings, there’s plenty to see in the city. This account, run by the L.A. Tourism Board, reminds you of all the things that draws more than 40 million annual visitors to our city. The account pulls photos from personal accounts using the hashtag #LAstory, motivating users to take their own photos.
So, if plagued with the post-spring break, pre-summer break blues, check out these accounts as the cure. Maybe a photo will feature the location of your future study abroad destination, give you ideas for a summer road trip, or even motivate a spur of the moment weekend adventure in Los Angeles. At the very least, they prove that there’s a world outside of Leavey.

On March 25, while holding a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, President Barack Obama announced a more specific vision for what he plans to do with U.S military troops in Afghanistan. Though plans for a military exit have been somewhat obscure up until now, Obama openly declared that he will slow down the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, maintaining his target of total withdrawal by the end of 2016. Obama reasoned that, after consulting with Ahmadzai and various military personnel, the United States should remain a significant presence in Afghanistan. This would fully equip Afghan forces with the necessary training and support to lead an effective battle against the Taliban and other extremist organizations for the years to come.
Though this may be a controversial issue for those hoping for a full exit from Afghanistan, the historical events that have transpired make the president’s approach seem logical.
Obama’s approach is reasonable because by asserting that United States support in Afghanistan has a deadline of 2016, the United States forces the Afghan government to maximize their window of support in the time allotted. Slowing down U.S. withdrawal amplifies their efforts by helping to build a stronger base of local Afghan military presence. Though Obama has remained adamant about his deadline, Afghanistan can show progress in their internal state of affairs in the time Obama has given. U.S. officials believe it to be necessary for security reasons to stay longer. Thus, troops will likely remain the in the area for longer. According to a Bloomberg Politics correspondent, Obama is willing to revisit the timeline he has set forth at the end of this year, illustrating his firm handling of the situation.
This approach guarantees that the Afghan government will not sit back and depend on the U.S. because it has the deadline looming over its head.
Using the Iraq situation as an example, Obama has seemingly learned from past mistakes. Early U.S. departure from a chaos-ridden area has proven to be anything but a success, as seen with the failure of Iraq’s own government and military to effectively handle their own state of affairs. In this sense, slowing down U.S. troops withdrawal is a necessary step to take. If the United States were to leave early, the probability of a government and military breakdown in Afghanistan is quite high. The idea of Obama’s plan being drawn out for longer than expected is a premature notion because we should be confident in our influence over the Afghanistan government before leaving.
At the same time, an extended vision of U.S. presence in Afghanistan is not necessary and could actually backfire against the U.S. Declaring such a strategy would make the Afghanistan government much too comfortable at a point where they should be anything but comfortable. The Afghans should be doing everything in their power to deleverage themselves from the U.S. while remaining effective and offensive in their battle against the Taliban. It tends to be true that people react quickly in grave situations. The longer the U.S. stays in Afghanistan, the less grave of a situation the Afghans find themselves in, thereby resulting in less of a need to correct political failures and build a cohesive society and functional government. Arguing for a prolonged establishment of American troops in Afghanistan is in fact flawed due to this psychological reality.
It seems as though Obama has taken a look at the factors from various angles and has incorporated a logical plan into action.
When will the president announce a withdrawal from Germany?

Time of the month. On the rag. Aunt Flo. Given the amount of nicknames Western society has attributed to menstruation, it’s a marvel we don’t talk about it more. Despite the abundance of available euphemisms and the fact that every woman in America will bleed, does bleed or has bled once a month, periods have remained taboo — until now.
With her photo series “Period,” Rupi Kaur, a 22-year-old student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, challenged the stigma surrounding menstruation by calling attention to its normality and beauty. Kaur knew she was going against the grain, but she didn’t expect that her Instagram photo would be removed twice or that a media explosion would follow. The support Kaur has garnered over the past week — as well as the initial backlash — reveals the importance of her work. After all, the college senior has proven that deconstructing the period taboo is essential to equality.
“Period” started as a photo series project for Kaur’s visual rhetoric course. As Kaur told Kaleigh Rogers from Motherboard, she posted the photo because she was proud. When Kaur looks at the photo in question, she thinks it’s “absolutely beautiful,” so while she knew she would stir up some controversy, she “never thought that it would be to this extent.”
Sure enough, Instagram removed the photo — which depicts the poet fully-clothed in grey sweatpants and a white tank top lying in bed with a red stain on the seat of her pants and a spot of blood on the sheets beside her — within 24 hours. Enraged, Kaur turned to Facebook and Tumblr, where she posted the photo with a caption addressing the irony of the period taboo, condemning patriarchal censorship, and celebrating the beauty of menstruation. In a Facebook post garnering more than 70,000 likes and 17,000 shares, Kaur asserted, “[I] will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak. When [sic] your pages are filled with countless photos/accounts where women (so many who are underage) are objectified. pornified. and treated less than human.” Kaur’s revolutionary words — “Their patriarchy is leaking. Their misogyny is leaking. We will not be censored” — flooded Internet in the days that followed, with countless blogs and news sites addressing the controversy.
A little over a day after the image’s second removal, Kaur’s photo reappeared on Instagram. Despite the fact that the photo was removed multiple times, Instagram spokespeople asserted that the removal was accidental in their emailed apology to Kaur and statements to news sites. Regardless of whether or not this was an honest mistake, there is nothing in the posting guidelines prohibiting the depiction period blood. Moreover, Instagram features an abundance of near-pornographic images, despite explicitly prohibiting such images.
The fact that someone would flag a perfectly tasteful depiction of menstruation and Instagram would then decide it was a good idea to remove the photo reveals a deep-seated misogyny in Western culture. After all, it’s got to be more than just squeamishness. As Emma Gray points out in her article for the Huffington Post, “We watch news reports about war and ‘Law & Order: SVU’ marathons without batting an eye, but there has still only been one menstrual product advertisement … that uses the color red to signify period blood.” It’s not an issue with the sight of blood so much as it is a double standard; women are supposed to bear children, but they’re also expected to be fantasy-beings, free from bodily excretions. You’d think that humanity could overlook a bit of blood, given the fact that menstruation is essential to human life, but revulsion justifies misogyny and misogyny justifies oppression.
Luckily for us, the secret’s out. The reinstatement of Kaur’s photos and the mass support she garnered spell out a clear victory for the feminist movement overall. Placing her story in the context of feminist progress, we can draw parallels to German feminist Elonë’s use of sanitary pads to call attention to sexual assault early this month. The young woman was inspired by a tweet: “Imagine if men were as disgusted with rape as they are with periods.” Elonë posted pads bearing these words as well as other poignant messages around Karlsruhe on International Women’s Day, igniting a social media explosion similar to Kaur’s.
Stigmas surrounding menstruation are ingrained in our culture, but they can only withstand so much exposure. Slowly but surely, the feminist cause is coming to fruition, and the normalization of periods is a vital step towards equality. Much as menstruation catalyzes life, deconstructing the period taboo will no doubt give birth to a greater respect for women.

One of philosopher Rene Descartes’ most famous philosophical statements reads, “Cogito ergo sum,” or “I think, therefore I am.” He posits the existence itself requires no evidence, and rather just contemplating existence proves it.
But what does it mean to exist? What if you did not truly exist in an encompassing universe? What if reality itself were an illusion? It’s a journey into metaphysical solipsism that presupposes that the experience of life itself — the relationships we create, the objects surrounding us, the pivotal moments that define our character — are nothing more than creations of the mind itself.
Then I don’t exist, and you don’t exist. The words that you are reading on this blog post don’t exist. In fact, this blog post doesn’t exist, and neither does the Daily Trojan nor USC. You manufactured this entire universe in which you found yourself on the Daily Trojan Blogs reading a blog post about existence. Clearly, you really should have manufactured a more fun universe.
By extension, solipsism implies that we don’t know anything outside our own mind. We — and everybody else — don’t know anything at all. Human knowledge is just an imaginative form of repackaging our mental constructions into a way that makes us feel important.
So then, if I can’t know anything, I can’t know that anything that I have said — including what I just said about being unable to know anything — is true at all. No one knows anything, nothing is real and no one exists. Great. I hope your head hurts as much as mine does, and happy April Fool’s Day.

“Rick Caruso, it’s a pleasure. I’ll be right with you, let me just get settled in my office,” Mr. Caruso said as he shook my hand in the lobby of Caruso Affiliated offices at The Grove in Mid-City Los Angeles.
Stepping out of the elevator, he was returning from a business meeting and was stepping into yet another. With his schedule over-booked for weeks, you would think wear-and-tear would begin to show on the University of Southern California alum, but with a passion and narrowed determination, Mr. Caruso appeared sharp as a nail, strolling down the elegant pathway to his office.
With his office perched atop Michael Kors and across Barneys New York, Caruso is a modern day Willy Wonka. He’s a brilliant visionary, and the impetus behind contemporary Los Angeles. Caruso predicates his life around family. With residential, commercial and mixed-use developments, Caruso has created shopping centers and residences alike that allow you to step into his world and vision. The Grove, The Americana at Brand, The Commons in Calabasas, 8500 Burton Way and several other properties are stitched across the Southland. Mr. Caruso continues to leave his mark on L.A. The Caruso world is bustling and booming and everyone wants a piece of the chocolate bar.
Even with his company and career reaching a crescendo, family comes first and with countless photos and portraits adorning his office, it’s no secret the Caruso family are a loving, close, and tight-knit bunch.
When his offices first confirmed a time to sit-down with Mr. Caruso, it was as if I had found the golden ticket. As I was escorted into his office and we sat down to talk, one thing became increasingly clear: Willy Wonka was opening the gates to his chocolate factory and giving me a glimpse into it.

DT: As many know, you graduated from USC, but could you briefly speak about your background (i.e. where you were born, raised, etc.)?
RC: I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I attended Catholic grammar school, then went to Harvard High School (now Harvard-Westlake). After I graduated from USC, I earned a JD at Pepperdine Law School and began to practice law.
DT: You were appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley as commissioner of the Department of Water and Power. How was your relationship with Bradley?
RC: I actually had no prior relationship with Bradley when I was appointed. Bradley was much older. I had just graduated law school; I was 25 practicing law, and virtually unknown to everyone. A friend had recommended me to the mayor to be appointed and I didn’t meet Mayor Bradley until shortly after that. I loved my time at DWP. I learned a lot and it was an extremely enriching experience.
DT: Did you always desire to enter real estate business? Or did it evolve from your time in civic leader positions?
RC: When I was a lawyer, I was practicing at one of the largest law firms at the time. After some mismanagement, it went bankrupt, but I stayed on. I slowly began to dabble in real estate. I owned a small duplex in Westwood and took care of that for a while, going in on weekends and landscaping and such. My assistant at the time, Laura Phelps, was a trusted aid and she helped out a lot. Caruso Affiliated began to emerge as I was buying up more properties and land to develop.
DT: Your wide array of retail and mixed-use properties has, as some say, fundamentally changed the way Los Angeles shops and eats. Briefly talk about the genesis of The Grove and if possible The Americana at Brand.
RC: Everything didn’t happen overnight, of course. I started small like anyone else. The company was really built organically. I never really wanted to do indoor malls that were sprouting across the L.A. region. Since I controlled the real estate, I wanted to evoke centers that reflected the outdoor squares and piazzas you see in Europe. I wanted to emulate downtown streets. The highest grossing stores in shopping centers aren’t spaces on the third floor inside a mall, they’re the stores on the street that are easily accessible and welcoming. Old town squares are a great way for people to get together and that’s what I wanted to bring to my developments: a way for people to enjoy their day. With the Americana, we began to see the blending of both commercial and residential spaces, which is started to grow for us and proving very popular.
DT: If you could elaborate, do you have any further development plans? Do you have plans to expand outside of Los Angeles?
RC: If we ever find a location or space that is suitable to our tastes, we’re always open to expanding. We have a 5-year plan to double in size and we’re on track to do just that. We’d love to see where we could go in downtown and the Arts District. I want to celebrate neighborhoods and have this sense of community in all parts of L.A. I feel like we missed out on the first wave in downtown, but there are always cycles in real estate. We’ll catch the next bus.
DT: What do you think of the transportation issues facing LA? Is expanding the Metro an effective, permanent solution?
RC: I’ve always felt very strongly about transportation. I never understood why we put people in tunnels in this city. I’d like to see people get out of their cars. We spend too much in our cars and not enough time enjoying what’s around us. Transportation is an important aspect to discuss in L.A.
DT: Other than your own developments, what are some of your favorite shopping centers in LA? What are some of your favorite cafes/restaurants to visit?
RC: I like visiting Larchmont, the Palisades. I’m always all over L.A. and I love everything about this city.
DT: Do you have any advice for students and burgeoning entrepreneurs?
RC: Do what you love. Do what you’re passionate about. If you do that, you’ll never have to work a day in your life. You’ll be outperforming others by doing what you love to do.

There’s a point during study abroad when you’ll no longer feel like a tourist in your adopted city.
And that’s usually around the same time your parents decide to visit you across the pond.
My mom and dad made their first international trip last Saturday to visit me for a week in London. They had a list of activities and sites they wanted to see. They came just as school papers were bogging me down, in the thick of my internship hunt and growing general apathy toward the historic yet overly familiar sites.
That’s why, if feasible, everyone should take advantage of their parents or out-of-town friends visiting them in their study abroad city. It will remind you of the wonders that your study abroad city has to offer — and encourage you to get back out and explore.
So below is a list of touristy things in London that are still good to see a second — or sometimes — third time when entertaining your parents as you study abroad.
If America runs on Dunkin, then Brits certainly run on tea. High tea is a staple of British culture, but oftentimes as a student you don’t take advantage of it. With the constant flow of papers and Netflix dates, you forget to slow down and take time for tea. So when you have visitors in town definitely make an effort to set aside at least two hours of your time — and clear your palate – to eat scones, watercress sandwiches and a pot of Earl Grey. Teatime will give you an opportunity to engage in conversation, plan the next sites you will see and enjoy the company around you.
Because it is one of London’s largest museums and holds a considerable amount of the world’s treasures, it would be a shame not to soak in all that the British Museum has to offer. Initially its size can be intimidating and you won’t know where to go, but the museum has structured, half hour tours for each section of the world. You can also independently peruse the museum, looking at the large collection of Greek statutes or get a glimpse of the Rosetta Stone (the actual stone and not the language learning software). The British Museum, like most museums in London, is free so you can go back as many times as you’d like!
Theater shows are easily accessible in the town that brought you William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. You initially might not be interested in spending a couple hours out of your day watching a live theater show (I mean, those hours could be used watching Netflix), but definitely experience it. The level of talent in London is extremely high and it is another way to spark conversation and create memories with your parents or friends who are visiting from out of town.
It’s a simple concept, to say the least. But when you decide to sit at the top of the bus you gain a whole new perspective on London. By sitting on top, you’re forced to take in all the historic sites of the city: St. Paul’s Cathedral, the London Bridge or Buckingham Palace.Part of adapting to a new environment is taking in the beauty around you. When you’re with visitors in town they want to see everything and riding on top of the double decker bus encourages you to do so.
So don’t let the familiarity of your study abroad city make you lose awe of the breathtaking sites it holds. Keep your head up (literally) and explore it as if it’s still your first week there.

The efforts to unionize USC adjunct and part-time faculty intensified on Monday as advocating members made their plans to organize public.
Currently, a group of non-tenured faculty are fighting for higher pay-per-course, greater job stability and ultimately, the formation of a union.
“We are in the midst of a crisis in higher education,” wrote the faculty members on their newly formed website uscfacultyunion.org. “A new model has evolved in higher education that relies on a large workforce of contingent faculty, who are marginalized in our academic communities, with no guarantees to academic freedom, teaching under substandard conditions and with inadequate compensation.”
Whispers of such an effort began early in the spring semester, and interim Vice Provost Michael Quick issued a letter to faculty in late February discouraging such actions. He stressed that unionization would be a damaging choice for USC.
“A big concern of mine is that our collegial processes would be eclipsed by an industrial model of labor relations: an adversarial model,” he wrote. “We at USC have a strong system of faculty governance, which emphatically includes non-tenure-track faculty.”
On Monday, however, non-tenured faculty began publicly circulating a petition advocating for the university community’s support in their efforts to unionize. The document read that the signers agree to “hold USC accountable” and support non-tenure track faculty in their unionization efforts.
The online petition had just over 60 signatures as of Monday night.
The movement at USC is being mounted by the Service Employees International Union through their Faculty Forward campaign, a national “grass roots” awareness effort meant to highlight the conditions of part-time faculty. The movement is advocating nationally for $15,000 per course for adjuncts.
Adjunct faculty currently make roughly $5,000 per course they teach a semester. Some adjuncts claim these are not livable wages.
“USC really provides a space for intellectual development and for education, but apart from that, the conditions of work have been very difficult,” said Noura Wedell, an adjunct faculty member in the Roski School of Art and Design.
Wedell spoke Tuesday night at a public forum discussing better wages for Los Angeles workers. The event highlighted the efforts of USC part-time faculty to unionize. The panel was held at Exposition Park in the office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas.
Those in attendance — many of whom were minimum wage workers — were encouraged to sign the aforementioned petition.  Members of the USC group, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, were also present and have expressed their support of unionization efforts.
“Our learning conditions are your working conditions, so this is very important to us,” said SCALE member Maria Rodriguez to faculty members present at the forum.
In addition to adjunct faculty, some non-tenure track professors have also expressed efforts to unionize. Jamal Ali, an associate professor (teaching) of Arabic who has taught at USC for three years, cited the unpredictably of his teaching position as a motivating factor to join unionization efforts.
“I have a contract which is renewable or nonrenewable at the whim of administration,” Ali said. “It’s a little better than an adjunct, but we’re part of the union movement as well.”
USC did not immediately respond to requests for comment in light of Monday’s events.
The part-time faculty’s efforts come just weeks after the university came to an agreement with USC Hospitality workers earlier this month, who were similarly fighting for higher wages and longer hours through a local union. The university agreed to a 75 cent raise from their current $11 wage.
Part-time faculty are now gearing up for a similar fight.
“I am considering changing careers,” Wedell said.  “And the organizing and unionizing we’re doing is the only thing that can change my mind about that.”
Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect the proper name for the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. A previous version referred to them as the Student Organization Against Labor Exploitation. 
it has also been updated to note that Jamal Ali is an associate professor (teaching), not an associate professor as previously stated.
The Daily Trojan regrets this error. 
Fight on, Adjuncts! The Trojan Family support you. Solidarity.
