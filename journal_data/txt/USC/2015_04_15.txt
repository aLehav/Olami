The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics held this semester’s final installment of “Students Talk Back: A Weekly Politics and Public Policy Forum,” on Wednesday afternoon at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The event featured special guest and former Director of the CIA, David H. Petraeus.
Petraeus, a four-star general, served as CIA director from 2011 until his resignation on November 9, 2012. Petraeus has 37 years of experience assisting coalition forces, as he was a Commander for the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. He commanded troops from 2003-2008. In 2010, he was deployed to Afghanistan.
Petraeus discussed the importance of generating discourse on the topic of foreign policy in the upcoming presidential elections, while also noting that candidates from both the Republican and Democratic parties would address national security with varying levels of emphasis. The moderators encouraged Petraeus to narrow in on significant events or topics within foreign policy including cybersecurity, automated warfare and use of conventional tactics.
The event was moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute and moderator of the event and David Moreno, assistant director of elections and recruitment of Undergraduate Student Government; Daniel Rothberg, former managing editor of the Daily Trojan; and Rachel Scott, reporter and executive producer of Annenberg TV News.
Schnur set the discussion in motion by asking Petraeus to identify the role foreign policy will and should play in the forthcoming presidential campaign.
“Almost every four years, we hear that foreign policy and national security will be a critical component in elections, with rare exceptions in 1980 and 2004,” Schnur said. “Generally, as the campaign progresses, public attention tends to shift towards domestic policy.”
Petraeus explained that foreign policy attracts greater visibility as elections progress.
“I think [foreign policy] is actually receiving greater prominence as the election cycle progresses. A part of that it as of course, is the perception that the world, at least parts of it, are in flames,” Petraeus said. “The Middle East is in crisis…you see Russia threatening Ukraine and really flouting the norms of excepted interstate behavior since the end of the cold power; you see China flexing its muscles from the east and south china sea, ramming a Vietnamese ship after moving their oil platform into Vietnamese waters and so forth.”
He also discussed the way in which Americans perceive the ongoing tensions between military forces occupying foreign grounds. He explained that over the past few years, there has been a tangible shift between whether it is possible for the U.S. to cut militant interaction overseas, specifically noting that President Obama began his presidential term in hopes of leading U.S. armed forces out of war zones.
“There are lots of crises out there and I think they are starting to appear on the view screens of Americans more than was the case even just a couple of years ago — when the sense was that we were getting out of wars rather than getting back into them,” Petraeus said.
Petraeus said that history has proven that candidates from the Republican party will emphasize national security at large during their campaign. He recollected the fact that many politicians have emphasized their opinions of former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton during her reign of “failed” foreign policy.
“Particularly on the Republican side, foreign policy will play a big role in the primary,” he said. “But, I think that the Republicans will try to make it a more prominent part of the campaign than might have otherwise been the case.”
He emphasized that though foreign policy will garner a lot of attention, voters will still rank residing economic issues higher.
“Depending on who the Republican candidate is, it [foreign policy] will be elevated…but then, everyone votes their wallet,” Petraeus said. “They vote on the fact that the middle class hasn’t seen real wages rise, that the income disparity [exists]…I think this [issue] will actually be up there as certainly [one of] the big five issues.”
Petraeus focused on a specific area where voters and politicians will concentrate on during elections.
“I think the issues…will be trying to assert that the Obama administration is responsible for the instability in the wake of saving the Arab spring countries and the other side saying that domestic populations in those countries had a little bit to do with this,” Petraeus added.
The conversation shifted to the issue of stressing certain elements of foreign policy. Rothberg questioned which foreign policy events from the past and present should be paid more attention to. Petraeus covered both bases by explaining that in the light of current national crises, all topics including cyber security, automated warfare and conventional tactics should be drawn upon. He explained that both presidential candidates in the 2016 election will place an emphasis on the U.S. as a leading global force.
“A big issue will be America’s role in the world,” Petraeus said. “Ultimately, both candidates from the two different parties will assert that the U.S. does have to lead; it can’t follow…but there will be some nuance in there where one side will undoubtedly be a bit more aggressive in what it puts forward.”
Petraeus explained that Americans remain undecided on the issue of foreign relations, given the frequent militant interaction within the last decade in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.
“The American public, given the cost, the frustrations and so forth of Iraq and Afghanistan is still a bit weary about involvement overseas, but is increasingly concerned about the threats posed by the rise of the Islamic state in Iraq … by the continued activities and various Al Qaeda affiliates, particularly Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula, which is now taking advantage of the state of turmoil in Yemen to break it’s comrades out of prison.”
He also addressed issues of ISIS and terrorist threats by explaining that the group poses a series of threats to global leaders.
“The problems of ISIS are not just threats…it’s a threat to the homeland and potentially a threat to various global and economic endeavors as well,” he said. “I think Iraq can move forward — but at the end of the day, it is about Iraqi politics…it is, at heart, a struggle for power and resources and that can take place within the Shia and Arab sects.”

The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Environmental Student Assembly hosted Golden Globe-nominated actress and businesswoman Jessica Alba at Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night. Alba, the signature speaker for Earth Month 2015, shared her thoughts on environmentalism and entrepreneurship in a contemporary society.
Alba emphasized the importance of a strong work ethic as a key to her success.
“They [my parents] really taught me about what hard work is all about,” Alba said. “We lived off $14,000 a year. I just [saw] how saddened my parents were, you know … they still wanted to have fun and still wanted to be young, but more than anything they wanted me to have opportunities.”
Alba had chronic asthma and severe allergies when she was younger, which landed her in the hospital on multiple occasions and thus gave her time to daydream about becoming an actress.
She also said how her father would have preferred her to become a tennis star at his favorite university, USC. After being hired by James Cameron for the TV sitcom, Dark Angel, at age 17, she started working 16 hour days and her career eventually took off, as she went on to star in blockbuster movies such as Sin City and Fantastic Four.
When Alba was pregnant with her first daughter, Honor, in 2008, she asked her mother for advice on a laundry detergent, after experiencing a horrible allergic reaction. After some online research about the toxic chemicals in many cleaning products, Alba came up with the idea of starting The Honest Company, a company  dedicated to creating affordable and effective products that would build safe home environments and revolutionize household products.
During her three-year research period, before honing in on a business model, Alba faced criticism for trying to penetrate a market saturated with multi-billion dollar corporations. Alba said that what differentiates her company from others is that The Honest Company is not only concerned with the bottom line — it’s concerned about the health ramifications of everyday products such as shampoo, laundry detergent and diapers.
Alba talked about how aside from maintaining a health mission for their products, The Honest Company trains employees to care for and educate individual customers and donates to non-profits.
“We have a young office [in Santa Monica] where everyone believes in the mission of what we do,” Alba said. “That’s how we hire. We hire people who want to create a non-toxic world, [in which] people who believe in each other. And it’s really a family.”
Alba also wrote a book called The Honest Life in which she talks about the breakdown of toxic chemicals in everyday products.

Hundreds of Los Angeles workers and community members gathered Wednesday in the neighborhood surrounding the University Park campus to rally for an increase in the minimum wage from $9 to $15.25 with enforcement provisions and paid sick leave.
Part of a national effort, the demonstration, organized by the coalition Raise the Wage LA, was called “Fight for $15 on 4/15” and began in downtown Los Angeles early Wednesday morning. Around 11 a.m., workers made their way toward Figueroa Street and 28th Street. Many of the demonstrators were employees of McDonald’s and other businesses in the area. The event culminated in a final march to USC’s campus, down Trousdale Parkway to Tommy Trojan, where supporters chanted before dispersing around 1 p.m.
In addition to USC organizations and adjunct professors, participants included workers from across Los Angeles County representing faith-based organizations, nonprofits, unions and grassroots campaigns. These included large union groups such as the Service Employees International Union and We Care LA.
Michael Green, the regional director of SEIU, helped organize the demonstration. He said that similar events were occurring throughout the country.
“Today is a special day,” Green said. “As you realize, it’s 4/15/15 — fight for $15 on 15. Not only are we doing this here; we’re doing it in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Seattle — all the major cities.”
Green said the demonstrators come from a wide variety of backgrounds.
“We have people of different ethnicities, with different interests from San Gabriel Valley to San Fernando Valley, to South Central L.A. and all the way to Harbor City and Wilmington and the Pacific Palisades,” Green said. “We’re all here together: L.A. County workers from custodians to parks and recreations workers to social workers, nurses, support services, clerical units. Everybody is here together.”
Currently, USC workers make an average of $18,800 annually, A recent amendment to the USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services contract has increased their wages by 75 cents.
Wednesday’s rally comes as the Los Angeles City Council is considering a proposal to raise the minimum wage in the city to $13.25 by 2017 or $15.25 to 2019.
Opponents of such an increase warn that it could potentially harm small businesses and nonprofits, especially those with small profit margins.
Green lauded the supportive role non-tenure track faculty played in the rally. Faculty Forward, a national “grass roots” awareness effort meant to highlight the conditions of part-time faculty under SEIU, was also present at the demonstration.
“We have been engaged with some of the faculty here that have expressed interest and asked for help in making sure that we can create a pathway for their future and create a gateway for our own.”
He also explained that all of the demonstrators had the desire to display their common sentiment towards wages.
“We wanted to make a statement that we’re all in this together,” Green said. “Whether it [be] adjunct professors, with the disparity and inconsistency of them having no job protection and having to survive on inadequate wages, whether it’s McDonald’s workers, or the Los Angeles County workers, or any other workers in Los Angeles that are trying to survive and pay rent and make less than $15 an hour.”
Green closed his remarks by explaining that the rally was an act of brining workers together.
“Our action is going to speak for us … we’re all in this together,” he said. “We want to take away poverty wage and replace them with living wages.”
How is it that USC allows outside workers/people, who have nothing to do with USC, to come to the middle of campus and to hold a rally, no doubt disrupting the day for some USC people? Is USC now public space where anyone can come to air grievances about anything?
Nikias has taken this “All Inclusiveness” way too far. We pay a lot of money for our children to attend. It’s bad enough that the locals take over the athletic fields on weekends, blocking their use by students, but now they hold court on campus? RIDUCULOUS!!!

Helen Lowman, associate director of the Peace Corps, has recently visited campus to reach out to student organizations in hopes of attracting more students to join the Peace Corps following graduation.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Lowman said that she hopes to improve safety for young volunteers who are often hesitant to join the organization in fear of their safety.
The Peace Corps offers four different partnership programs with colleges. The Peace Corps Prep Program allows undergraduate students to train and receive a certificate; the Campus Ambassadors program promotes the Peace Corps on campus; the Fellows Program provides financial incentive for graduate students to join and the Master’s International program allows graduate students to complete two years of work related to their master’s degree.
Currently, USC only offers the Fellows program, but Lowman expressed interest in starting a Peace Corps Prep Program on campus.
The Peace Corps provides opportunities for students from a wide variety of disciplines. Volunteers choose to apply for one of six primary sectors: agriculture, environment, community Economic development, health, education and youth in development.
Lowman herself served in Thailand for three years with the Peace Corps immediately after graduating from college. She served as the associate director for the environmental program in China, the country director for China, the country director for Mongolia and the regional director for operations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia before assuming her current role.
The Peace Corps was founded by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, with goals to promote international development, civilian diplomacy and world peace. Within the program’s first two years, it attracted over 7,000 volunteers serving in 44 countries. Today, the Peace Corps has programs in 139 countries, with over 200,000 total current and returned volunteers. Most volunteers are recent college graduates.
“Colleges are our most important partners, because the vast majority of our volunteers come directly from college campuses,” Lowman said.
After reports that a substantial amount of American women were sexually abused while volunteering with the Peace Corps, the organization has been plagued with concerns over the safety of its volunteers. In response, Lowman said the Peace Corps launched various reform efforts to ensure the health and safety of volunteers.
“We’ve instituted very strict standards on the development of sites, jobs and communities for our volunteers to keep them safe…and we’ve started an office for the victim’s advocate, which advocates for any volunteer that has been the victim of a crime,” said Lowman. “There is always an inherent risk in the Peace Corps, but we tried to do everything we can to limit that risk.”
Looking forward, one of Lowman’s hopes for the organization is increasing government funding, which would allow the Peace Corps to expand.
“Our hope is that we will be given the funding by Congress to increase our number of volunteers…The demand for Peace Corps is still very high,” Lowman said. “It’s very high from the countries where we work, and its very high from the U.S.

In its final match of the season, the No. 2 USC women’s tennis team will battle crosstown rival No. 5 UCLA Thursday at Marks Stadium. USC is playing hot coming into the match, carrying a 10-match winning streak to boost themselves to an impressive 20-2, 9-0 on the season.
UCLA is just behind in the rankings with a record of 18-3, 8-1.
Not only are the Women of Troy playing for a perfect 10-0 Pac-12 season, but with a win they will also capture the conference championship. USC has won championships in 2009, 2012 and 2013.
“There’s more emphasis because of it being the final match of the season and UCLA,” said standout freshman Meredith Xepoleas.  Xepoleas is one of six USC players ranked nationally in singles.
Junior Giuliana Olmos is ranked highest at No. 13, which is only two spots lower than her career-best ranking.  Senior Sabrina Santamaria is just behind her climbing into the    No. 19 spot.
Fellow senior All-American Zoë Scandalis is now at No. 61.  USC’s trio of freshman round out the national ranks for the squad with Gabby Smith at No. 75, Madison Westby at No. 78 and Xepoleas at No. 79.
“We come to practice with a lot of energy and work on what we need to work on,” Santamaria said.  “We’re ready for UCLA.”
UCLA, however, has not been an easy matchup for the Women of Troy in recent history.
The last time the Women of Troy were able to beat the Bruins was April 18, 2013 at Marks Stadium with a final score of 6-1 to finish off an undefeated      Pac-12 campaign for USC.
The two teams met earlier this season in Westwood on March 4.  UCLA delivered an upset in this match defeating USC 4-3 in a five-hour duel.
When asked about how the previous loss plays into the team’s preparation for this match, Xepoleas said that USC knows who they’re up against.
“It’s going to be really tough,” she said. “Especially since they just got their No. 1 player back.”  Xepoelas is referring to Robin Williams, who is ranked No.1 in the country.  The Bruins have five other payers in the national rankings.
USC is 48-43 against UCLA all-time, but they will be focused and ready to compete going into Thursday’s match said coach Richard Gallien.
“It’s easy to get too wound up,” Gallien said.  “It puts a bigger premium on managing yourself.  If you let the emotions run the show, then it’s in the hands          of the gods.”
Santamaria reitterated the team’s eagerness to get back on the court against their crosstown rivals.
“I don’t see it as the final match because we’ll have NCAA’s,” said Santamaria.  “But it is UCLA and we’re always excited to play UCLA.”  USC is coming into the match with an impressive ten win streak that extends through all of Pac-12 play and dates back to their match against UCLA.
Not only is the team playing well as a whole, but the Women of Troy have also been dominating their competition individually.  Olmos has won a team-high 32 singles matches this season.  Smith is next with 25 wins on the season,
Xepoleas and Scandalis have each won 23 matches, and Westby rounds out the 20-win crew with 21.
Of her 23 singles victories, Xepoleas has won her past 11 in a row.  Smith is the other hot hand coming into Thursday’s match on an eight-match win streak herself.
On the doubles side, the duo of Smith and Westby has won their past eight matches.
The Women of Troy will be looking for a strong start in doubles, as their record is a perfect 16-0 when winning the doubles point.
The match will kick off with doubles at 11:30 a.m.  Singles will follow at 1 p.m. and the match will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network.

Yesterday, a young life was taken in a Massachusetts court room. This isn’t an obituary, though it could be considered as one because it involves two human beings who are or will no longer be with us.
But first, let’s rewind a little to over three years ago when former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez nearly helped lead his team to a perfect season and a victory in Super Bowl 46 before Eli Manning and David Tyree’s helmet catch spoiled his and the Patriot’s parade.
At the age of 22, Hernandez not only caught a touchdown, but led the team in receptions on the world’s greatest stage, which just goes to show what a bright future he had in professional football.
The Patriots sure did believe that this would be the case, as later that summer, they locked up Hernandez long-term when he signed a five-year, $40 million contract.
Fast forward three years later, and Hernandez is, indeed, locked up; that’s for sure. Except, it’s behind bars, where he will regrettably spend the rest of his life.
The former Patriots star, who once milked a lucrative pro-football contract, was slapped in the face by reality on Wednesday when his fate was revealed by jurors.
After more than 30 hours of deliberating, the jury found Hernandez guilty of the first-degree murder of one-time friend Odin Lloyd and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
At the age of just 25, Hernandez’s life is basically over. He was convicted of taking another human being’s life, and the price he will pay is his very own.
Now that justice has been served, he will almost certainly never see the football field, where he once made a living, ever again.
That is unless some type of Longest Yard underground prison football league exists, but I think Bert Reynolds already knew that he was pushing it in the 2005 remake of the film.
The closest Hernandez will ever get to football again will be the sounds of game days at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, which he would likely be able to hear from the yard of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution Cedar Junction at Walpole if he’s still serving his sentence there when the 2015 season starts.
The maximum security prison where Hernandez will begin his sentence is ironically only a few miles and a short drive away from the stadium.
Without a doubt, there’s a tremendous lesson to be learned from what has transpired with Hernandez, especially for student athletes.
If there’s one thing to learn, it’s to surround oneself with solid, capable people.
That may have been difficult for Hernandez, who as a member of the Florida Gators football team from 2007 to 2009, was surrounded with players who had been in trouble with the law.
According to a New York Times piece from 2013, the 2008 Gators team that would go on to win the BCS National Championship under the direction of former head coach Urban Meyer listed a roster of 121 players, 41 of which had been arrested at some point during or after college.
I’m not implying that there is a direct correlation between this substantial number of arrested players and the trouble Hernandez got himself into; I mean, Tim Tebow and Cam Newton were also members of that team. But, it just goes to show the importance of hanging out with the right people starting at an early age.
Circling back home, not all USC players have been perfect citizens with the law either, though the numbers are significantly less.
In January 2013, former redshirt freshman tight end Junior Pomee was arrested and charged with multiple felonies, though they were later dismissed by a judge. He was dismissed from the team by         then-head coach Lane Kiffin.
About a year later, former Trojans wide receiver Victor Blackwell was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, and most recently in January, redshirt freshman linebacker Don Hill was arrested for DUI in Idaho.
I understand that sometimes, things happen, especially as college students, and in no way, shape or form am I comparing any of these athletes for the morally unacceptable actions that Hernandez was convicted of committing.
It would be such a shame, however, to see any student athlete throw away all of their talent and everything they have worked to accomplish because the sad truth is that a lot of very gifted people do get caught up with the wrong crowd and end up perpetrating actions that are out of their normal character.
There’s always the argument that something of this magnitude would never happen to me, but the thing is, anyone could have been in the shoes of either Hernandez or Lloyd.
Would you have ever expected to see OJ Simpson, a former Heisman trophy winner, or Ryan Leaf, a former No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, behind bars? It’s really hard to see someone you once looked up to be handcuffed and taken away by authorities, but that’s reality of our justice systems and it teaches us all, athletes or not, that there are consequences for our actions.
For Hernandez, however, it’s a timeout that he almost surely won’t be able to escape from.
At a time, he had the world at his fingertips with an extremely promising future, but instead of visiting the White House with the 2015 Super Bowl champion Patriots and seeing fans wear jerseys with his name on the back, it looks like he will be signing autographs behind bars as inmate number W106228 for the rest of his life.

Wrapping up a regular season that has been filled with highs and lows, the men’s volleyball team will look to end conference play on one more high note this weekend. The No. 8 Trojans will have a home-and-home series with unranked Cal Baptist today and Saturday before heading into the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference tournament.
Cal Baptist (6-20, 2-18 MPSF) is the only conference rival that has yet to face the Trojans (16-8, 13-7) this season. The Trojans currently sit in fourth place in the conference standings, while Cal Baptist is second-to-last.
The Trojans beat the Lancers in four sets (25-13, 25-22, 21-25, 25-21) at home last year and then took all three sets (25-22, 25-21, 25-22) at Cal Baptist.
Two wins this weekend against Cal Baptist would guarantee that the Trojans can maintain their fourth place ranking in the conference standings. The teams with the eight best records in conference play out of the 12-team conference will qualify for the conference tournament. The winner of the conference tournament earns an automatic bid to the NCAA national championship tournament.
The NCAA tournament features six teams, with four conferences having automatic bids and two        at-large bids up for grabs.
Finishing in the top four would guarantee that the Trojans host the first round of the MPSF playoffs. In his weekly media recap, Coach Bill Ferguson said this would be crucial to the chances of the team winning the tournament.
“That’s huge,” Ferguson said. “When we set out every year, we want to win the national championship, and the first way to do that is to finish in the top four of the MPSF.”
The eight-team, three-round MPSF tournament happens over the course of two weekends. The quarterfinals are all played at the home court of the four higher seeds. The semifinals and finals are both hosted the following week at the home court of the top overall seed.
This season, the Trojans are 10-3 at home but 6-5 on the road.
“Everything is a little more advantageous when you’re at home, so that’s the goal,” Ferguson said.
The last time the Trojans qualified for the NCAA tournament was in 2012. The Trojans finished the season in first place in the MPSF, swept Cal State Northridge in the first round of the tournament and then were upset by fourth-seeded UC Irvine in the semifinals. The Trojans nonetheless earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, advancing to the national championship game but falling again to UC Irvine in the final.
Last year, the Trojans qualified for the MPSF tournament as the final seed but were knocked out by top-seeded BYU in the first round. In 2013, the Trojans did not qualify for the MPSF tournament.
“We’d obviously like to win it every year, but to finish top four and to host that first round playoff match and to get things going, we’ve had tremendous success when we host a first round playoff match,” Ferguson said. “If we’re finishing in the top four of the most competitive athletic conference in all of college sports, then we’re feeling like we’re on the right track.”
The Trojans currently sit behind No. 1 Hawai’i (23-3, 18-2), No. 4 UC Irvine (24-4, 18-3) and No. 2 Pepperdine (22-4, 17-4) in the MPSF standings. Just trailing the Trojans are fifth place and No. 6-ranked BYU (15-9, 12-8). No. 9 UC Santa Barbara (15-9, 11-9), currently in sixth place, could also hypothetically jump the Trojans for fourth place. USC will need to win both remaining matches to guarantee the fourth place spot.
USC has split with all five of the other MPSF teams in the top six spots of the conference standings.
Last week, the Trojans had a relatively relaxed schedule, with only one non-conference match. The Trojans took down Concordia in four sets (25-22, 23-25, 25-21, 26-24) using a roster primarily of backups.
Junior outside hitter Alex Slaught led the team with 19 kills, with senior opposite Cristian Rivera and freshman outside hitter Jack Wyett adding 15 kills each. Redshirt sophomore Michael Mullahey got the start at setter and recorded 54 assists. Redshirt freshman libero Riley Mallon pitched in 10 digs.
Usual starters like senior setter Micah Christenson, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers, junior libero Brooks Varni and sophomore middle blocker Andy Benesh had the night off. Ferguson also said that the team had a couple days off during that week of practice.
The Trojans began the season on a seven-game winning streak, climbing as high as No. 2 in the American Volleyball Coaches Association national poll, but faced much more difficulty through the latter half of conference play. Nonetheless, the Trojans have proven that they can compete against the top teams in the country with three victories over top five teams, including a win over                               top-ranked Hawai’i.
The Trojans visit Cal Baptist today at 7 p.m., then host the Lancers at the same time on Saturday.
Coach Ferguson couldn’t win a national title when he had quality players like Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli. Lately his recruiting has been sub par overall. Unless this team makes a good run in the tournament time for a change at the top.

For freshman Tanner Smith, tennis has always been a part of the family. In 2004, Peter Smith, his father, took him to a USTA National Men’s 40s event at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. Now, more than a decade and two father-son championships later, Tanner is playing for the USC men’s tennis team under the direction of his father and coach.
Peter grew up in Connecticut and played many sports when he was young, but he found a liking for tennis and soon found himself coaching collegiate teams.
“We had a little tennis court in our driveway,” Peter said. “It was just something we did in the summertime. I just got more serious when we moved out to California when I was 14. I played college tennis, and I really just happened to end up becoming a college coach. It wasn’t anything I dreamed of doing or planned on doing. Other people saw things in me and they offered for me to be a college coach, which I never even thought about, but I fell in love with it immediately.”
Tanner isn’t the only son who wanted to play tennis. His two younger brothers, Riley and Colter, are also very interested in playing tennis with their dad in competition. In turn,  Peter has created a rotation schedule.
“Colter was feeling like ‘Hey, I’m the youngest. I always get left out.’ The older boys decided to let him join in the fun,” Peter said. “Now, Colter’s becoming a really good player. Really, in the end, you do it to enjoy time with your kids, not necessarily to win.”
Tanner began competing with his father in father-son matches at the Father-Son Nationals on hard courts at La Jolla in 2005. By 2007, the Smith father-son duo reached the quarterfinals at La Jolla. In 2010, the Smiths made trips to Boston for the Father-Son Nationals on grass courts and Cincinnati for the Father-Son Nationals on clay courts.
Looking back from 2004-2010, Tanner says that time was filled with mainly fun and learning.
“Those years were almost, in a way, the most fun because I was the little kid on the court and everyone would kind of pick on me, and I could somewhat hang in there, so it was a lot of fun,” Tanner said. “But, we definitely learned how to play together. There’s definitely a learning curve to it.”
“He learned that I’m in charge,” Peter added with a laugh.
In his younger years, Tanner was often called “shrimp,” but he says that name probably helped him more than it hindered him.
“At one point, we played a top junior.,” Tanner said. “I was like 12 years old, and we went out there and beat him and his dad because there’s no pressure on me. I’m just the little kid with the dad who’s really good.”
Peter further described the expectations for Tanner and himself by comparing it to movies.
“Life is a lot about expectations,” Peter said. “You go see a movie that everyone tells you is bad, and you’re not expecting a lot. Then the movie is pretty good. It’s the same [with us]. Tanner was 12, so everything was just upside.  For us to win any match was fun. When we started beating seeded teams and really good players, we were just having a blast.”
In 2011, Tanner and Peter made it to the final match at the Father-Son Nationals on clay courts in Cincinnati without dropping a set. The pair was knocked off, however, in a tough three-set loss to Jerry and Brett Morse-Karzen by a score of 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. A few months later, the Smiths assembled an impressive performance at La Jolla, which ultimately led them to face Brian and Brett Joelson, a pairing that was riding a 51-match tournament winning streak, in the semifinal match. The Smiths and Joelsons battled for three very close sets, but in the end, Tanner and Peter prevailed as major underdogs and defeated the Joelsons by a final score of 6-7(9), 7-6(5), 7-5.
Tanner and his father didn’t win in the finals, but Peter still believes that his semifinal win with his son was his “favorite match ever.”
“To beat a team that’s never been beaten before — that’s pretty cool,” Peter said.  “That match is really etched in my memory.Just to do something that had never been done before was really a lot of fun, and to do it with your oldest son — it’s pretty special.”
Even with that great memory, the two finals matches that the duo had lost in a matter of months were tough to swallow for Tanner and Peter.
“Honestly, I think those are the toughest two losses I’ve ever had,” Tanner said. “It just gave us some experience. It’s funny [because] you wouldn’t think father-son would need that much experience, but it’s such an experience game.”
“Those were extremely painful losses,” Peter said. “You’re playing with your son. You want to win for your son. It was the most pressure I’d ever felt. You just want to win, and then when you lose, it’s crushing .”
Tanner missed the 2012 and 2013 Father-Son Nationals on hard courts at La Jolla due to injury. Instead, Colter and Riley played with Peter at the Father-Son Nationals on hard courts. Colter and his father made it to the round of 16 in 2012, while Riley and his father took the Father-Son Nationals on hard courts title in 2013.After 17 months off, Tanner returned in 2014, and produced stellar tennis performances with his dad. Tanner and Peter were victorious in 80 percent of their matches on their way to the championship round at the Father-Son Nationals on clay courts. The Smiths dominated the first set 6-0, but found themselves facing a third set after losing the second set.
The Smiths found themselves down 4-3 in the final round and were determined not to lose another finals match. The two then rallied and won the next three games-in-a-row to become national champions.
The two would follow that accomplishment by winning at the Father-Son Nationals on hard courts in La Jolla in December.
Tanner says he feels like he is a strong doubles player, which he attributes partly to the father-son tennis matches he has played, but he also says that he has grown tremendously in his first semester at USC.
“This first semester I’ve improved so much, it’s scary,” Tanner said. “We really have the two best coaches in college tennis, and they’ve helped me so much. I feel like I’m a different player.”
Looking ahead, Peter will compete in father-son competitions this summer, but Tanner will not be his father’s partner this time.
“It’s Colter’s turn,” Peter said. “Colter and I are going to go play in Boston and Cincinnati this summer. We’re really looking forward to that. It’s all about having these incredible memories with your kids. As painful as it was losing for Tanner, they’re special times and they’re special memories. They bond you with your child like almost nothing else can…we just kind of look at each other and just say, ‘Let’s go, let’s do this.’”
Tanner couldn’t have agreed more with the man who is his father, partner and coach.
“It just brings you so close,” Tanner said. “It’s such a bonding moment to just be battling your heart out on the court. Come up short or win, it doesn’t matter. You’re just both battling your heart out, and it’s so cool.”

If you’ve talked to any grumpy old man before, you know that the government is corrupt and hides things. Just look at Watergate. Or spying by the NSA. Or the 11 miles of tunnels supposedly used by the Los Angeles city government to smuggle alcohol during the Prohibition era.
According to online sources, including the Los Angeles Times and KCET, an expansive tunnel system exists underneath Los Angeles. Different sources report that the tunnels were used for different things, including alcohol delivery, bomb shelters, homeless shelters and mobster transportation. Government officials jog in the tunnels for exercise; rumor has it that select Los Angeles bars still have access to the tunnels that once smuggled them booze.
The website Atlas Obscura contains the boldest description of the tunnels — 11 miles long, once used by the Mayor himself to run the city’s black market for alcohol during Prohibition.
How did I find the tunnels? Pure luck. As I perused Google Maps for the location of Farmacia y Botanica Million Dollar — an excellent shopping choice if you’re in the market for potions or voodoo dolls — I noticed a spot not-so-subtly labeled “Underground Tunnels of Los Angeles.”
To access the tunnels, find the door marked “Los Angeles County Archives …Shipping and Recieving.” The tunnels are a big secret, so you have to earn your right to them by finding them authentically (or by just utilizing the power of Yelp). My only hint: the door is near the Los Angeles Hall of Records, located in Civic Center.
Now, at this point I must offer a disclaimer. Officially, the tunnels are not open to the public. So officially, entering the tunnels is considered trespassing. The door is unlocked, however. And in my personal opinion, if you don’t want people to trespass, you lock the door. And you don’t make your trespassable location an easy-to-find point on Google Maps.
Just in case, I’ll share my trademark Erin Rode Rule of Trespassing: “Sorry, I got lost.” After just a few minutes in the tunnel, however, I realized that my usual defense wouldn’t work. Typically, this response comes to defend myself after wandering off a hiking trail onto private property or something of that sort — situations in which I have a legitimate reason to be in the area.  I couldn’t think of any possible excuse as to why I was wandering around somewhere below the Hall of Records.
I’ll be honest — the tunnels aren’t much of a tourist destination, especially for me, a Los Angeles girl who gets antsy if she’s away from the sun for more than 10 minutes. But if you’re looking for a sad, damp place to escape Los Angeles’ gorgeous sunlight, the tunnels may be the destination you’re looking for.
The tunnels are definitely worth visiting just to say you’ve been there. Go downstairs, take some photos and get out before something jumps out at you. That’s what I did; I trusted the Internet’s claims that the tunnels extended for 11 miles without fully exploring them myself.
I may have been wrong, however. Curious about the tunnels’ history, I reached out to John Welborne, tunnel expert. His actual qualifications include coming from a family that has inhabited Los Angeles since the 1860s, and being a board member of a variety of the city’s historic societies, but I prefer the term “tunnel expert.”
Welborne explained that what many believe is a coherent tunnel system is actually many isolated underpasses, sewage pipes and storm drains. He pointed out that outside of Internet heresay, the tunnels have no concrete proof. According to Welborne, the 11-mile tunnel is a myth. In fact, Welborne believes even a few miles of connected tunnels is unproven.
“If I offered you $100,000 for giving evidence of three miles of tunnels, without including sewer pipes or storm drains, you wouldn’t get that $100,000,” he said.
Apparently, the tunnels are a fluke, a mirage, the Loch Ness Monster of downtown Los Angeles. And according to Welborne, even the Loch Ness Monster is more believable than an 11-mile tunnel route.
“The difference between the tunnels and the Loch Ness Monster is that there are people who truly believe they saw the Loch Ness monster,” he said.
But I truly believe I saw the Loch Ness Tunnels. I visited the dark, damp tunnel; I saw it with my own eyes. I even Instagrammed it, and Instagram doesn’t lie. And yet — I barely entered the tunnels; all I know they could have ended a few feet past the entrance.
So for anyone I’ve excitedly gushed at about the tunnels over the past week — A.K.A. anyone I’ve talked to in the past week — I’d like to issue a partial retraction of my statement. Partial because part of me believes the tunnel expert, even though I know that the tunnel system must exist, because I know I didn’t imagine it.
You’ll have to explore for yourself, and then decide if you identify as a believer or nonbeliever. But remember, I’m not condoning trespassing.

Since the 1980s, the neighborhoods making up South Los Angeles have been known throughout popular culture as hotbeds of crime, gang activity and poverty. The city of Compton, the birthplace of gangsta rap and many well-known NBA players, is perhaps the most famous of these neighborhoods, primarily for its high crime rate. Especially after the L.A. Riots of 1992, the area became synonymous with gang-affiliated violence coupled with the growing crack epidemic of the time. Though crime rates have dropped significantly since then, Compton’s reputation has remained an exaggerated caricature of reality. Artist Kahlil Joseph, whose work is currently displayed at the Museum of Contemporary Art, explores the neighborhood through his film m.A.A.d, a project that acts as an ode to Compton and the African American community through its changing, misunderstood and multilayered identity. On view until Aug. 16, “Double Conscience” is, above all else, a narrative starring the individuals who call Compton home.
Joseph’s exhibition takes the form of a 14-minute split-screen film, consisting of two disparate projections that converge into one another, over a soundtrack provided by Kendrick Lamar. Throughout the video, the audience is transported through many views of Los Angeles, flying above congested freeways at rush hour and following school-age boys as they throw new skate tricks. Coupled with these familiar Southern California scenes are the rare quotidian moments that take place behind locked doors and in tucked-away bodegas. We see faces that radiate emotion and character, not just a city with an all-knowing bad label. Yes, there is violence and fear and sadness, too, but among them is a great deal of love, laughter and music. These are the moments that Joseph captures so effortlessly, through a combination of amateur film footage and music videos suffused with elements of magic realism. By placing a spotlight on moments that might otherwise seem mundane, “Double Conscience” is fully able to delve deep into the concept of African American identity, letting the everyday moments speak powerful volumes.
In what could be likened to a “film collage,” Joseph successfully employs a technique that hails back to auteur cinema, a branch of filmmaking that was pioneered by French director Jean Luc Godard. By collapsing disparate scenes of footage on top of one other, a film loses its linear narrative and instead becomes a more experimental vision that belongs primarily to the filmmaker. This technique proved successful in m.A.A.d. In 14 minutes, the video examines topics like race and its role in the formation of identity, which might have been a more challenging feat had Joseph opted for a traditional linear plotline.
The exhibition’s title and cinematography techniques are both allusions to W.E.B. Dubois’ idea of a “double consciousness” to describe life for African Americans in America. According to Dubois, there is often a line between being American and African American. The film highlights the separation, but also the intersections, between the two.
Throughout the narrative, the audience familiarizes itself with a slew of characters and personalities that show that there’s no singular representation of Compton. One clip shows a baby lying on his back atop a foam play mat. The scene is shot indoors, and for a minute, we watch his small belly rise and balloon with air. It’s an immensely raw and personal moment, a glimpse of a city through what is perhaps its most micro lens. In another clip, we see two girls at a neighborhood clothing store. They are giggling as they hold hangers of clothing against their chests. We are given virtually no information about the lives of these girls, or really any of the individuals that appear in the film. No plotline connects the dialogue or visuals with each clip, but it’s difficult not to identify with many of the characters — to want to know their stories. Joseph allows viewers to forge a special bond with the characters in m.A.A.d, as they look in on some of life’s moments that are so unremarkable, they are terrifically personal. The girls cease to be strangers after we see them in the store, and we become familiar with the way the baby breathes.
Another highlight of the film takes place within a neighborhood grocery store. For a few minutes, we are presented with a montage of portraits, showing individuals standing next to a large refrigerator. Some smile, some sport tattooed faces — others don flashy clothing. For a few seconds, we’re presented with each individual’s natural movement and mannerisms before the camera. And though it appears to be an unscripted film shot in the most ordinary of places, it is a scene dedicated to the people of Compton — to their personalities and individual quirks, which all converge beside a supermarket refrigerator.
Toward the end, or beginning, of the footage (the loop makes it difficult to tell) are a series of aerial shots that peer down on the lights that so characterize the city. There is faint dialogue in the background that is difficult to discern, and no matter how the camera orientation changes, the cars on the freeway continue to move. Amid the struggles that so popularly characterize life in Los Angeles, the unrelenting movement seems to bring a sense of continual change. Progress is perhaps in the momentum of the cars and music from the streets, and identity is still being formed through each individual’s story.

Recently, the infamous Kardashian clan has found itself confronting a social issue: transgenderism. Though there has been much speculation about Bruce Jenner transitioning from male to female, he will finally discuss his sex change in an interview with Diane Sawyer on April 24. Additionally, Jenner will address his changing looks and new identity to his family on the series finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and he will further promote his transition in a new documentary series on E!. As a famous Olympian and reality star, Jenner’s high-profile transition will be important to society’s view of the transgender community, as it will teach a larger audience to accept transgenderism and the LGBT community.
Until recently, there was no transgender visibility in the media. It was only seven years ago that transgender model Isis King competed on the reality television series America’s Next Top Model, a breakthrough for transgenderism in the mainstream media. Since then, the media has become more accepting of transgender actors. Most famously, actress Laverne Cox plays a transgender woman in Orange Is the New Black.
Though there has been growing transgender representation in the media, few transgender individuals have been prominently featured, and none of them have openly displayed their full transition on a reality TV series. By broadcasting Jenner’s transition to a large audience, viewers will have a better understanding of the transgender movement. Additionally, Jenner’s personal reality series will cover the details of his transition, especially how his famous family will handle the situation. Jenner’s new reality series will teach people to grasp the concept of transgenderism and expand upon the concept of gender identity, likely helping other people in the same situation transition into their appropriate gender roles.
Furthermore, people will relate to Jenner due to his extensive accomplishments. Jenner has been in the spotlight since 1972, when he first competed in the Summer Olympics in Munich. Jenner has remained in the public eye as an athlete and reality star. Because Jenner has been profiled in the media for more than 30 years, people of all age groups know his legacy. Jenner’s status as a celebrity will help normalize transgenderism for decades to come.
Despite his fame, Jenner has lived the life of a stereotypical man. Now 65 years old, Jenner has been divorced three times and has six children. Jenner lived his life seemingly embracing his supposed masculinity as an athlete, a husband and father. Jenner’s transition from male to female should inspire people, no matter their age and domestic roles, to embrace the gender they feel they were supposed to be. As Jenner says in a promo for his Diane Sawyer interview, “My whole life has been getting me ready for this.”
The transgender movement continues to grow, and Jenner’s upcoming declaration of identity will be monumental. By revealing his new identity, Jenner will expose people from all belief systems to the transgender population. By bravely displaying his transition to the public, Jenner will serve as a symbol and inspiration to the LGBT community, spreading the word that transgenderism deserves acceptance too.

This week, a natural gas export plant in the Shabwa province of southern Yemen was shut down after being sieged by armed tribesmen. This latest setback after weeks of unrest in Yemen underscores a glaring truth of the Middle East’s poorest country: Yemen is a failed state. For years, many in both academic and popular discourse have decried Yemen as a failed state. This verdict has become more and more evident ever since the ousting of longtime autocrat and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The country has descended into chaos and instability, and the latest Saudi Arabian-led operation on March 26 against the Houthis, a group of Shiites who were oppressed under Saleh, further destabilizes the country and adds to the idea that Yemen as an autonomous country has failed.
In 2011, Saleh was swept away amid the fever of the Arab Spring. Many other dictators faced the same fate, and for a while it seemed as if Yemen was going to undergo a democratic makeover. Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, Saleh’s vice president, took over, and rather than taking Yemen a step forward, the ingredients for a failed state began to come to a boil. Hadi and his government were seen as corrupt, and the Houthis began to mobilize to take control of the country. In Islam, there are two major sects — Sunni and Shiite. Yemen is mostly Sunni, while the Houthis are Shiite. Iran, which is also Shiite, began supporting the Houthi campaign, much to the displeasure of Sunni Saudi Arabia. That was the impetus for Saudi airstrikes and military operations last month against the Houthis. All the while, the United States has supported Yemen as a key base for anti-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Though many point to the conflict between Houthis and Hadi’s regime as the cause of Yemen’s most recent woes, the reality is that years of oppression and stagnation under Saleh caused deeply rooted problems that have yet to be fully realized. South Yemen, formerly a separate country, was mostly comprised of Sunnis until the civil wars in the 1990s resulted in the unification of North and South Yemen, which transformed two religiously homogenous states into one religiously heterogeneous state.
Furthermore, the infrastructure of Yemen is decrepit at best. Schools, hospitals, roads and bridges are crumbling by the day. The natural gas plant shutdown affects the energy sector of Yemen’s economy. Despite being a small oil producer, Yemen has an economy that is 57 percent oil exports. The recent shutdown is the nail in the coffin of Yemen’s economy and spells more trouble for the embattled country. Additionally, there is an extreme water shortage, food is scarce, and military operations are wounding and killing far too many civilians. Yemeni society is oppressive, with egregious human rights violations, particularly in the treatment of women. Airstrikes have depleted the country of any sense of stability, and it is being torn apart by military operations and political strife. If Iraq is the poster child of failed states in the Middle East, Yemen, sadly, is the encore presentation. Much like in Afghanistan, deeply rooted tribal tensions and profound mistrust among rival groups are major barriers to building a stable country. Much like in Iraq, political drama and military actions place the country under deep distress, and a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the dynamics and nuances of the parties involved create more tension and roadblocks to unity. In the Middle East, failed states have become far too common. The causes might be debated and argued, theories posited and rejected, but in today’s world, Yemen is the latest victim of a tragic bug in the Middle East.
Many around the world, particularly in the United States, view the Gulf States as despotic, dependent and extremely wealthy countries. They might not even know what the UAE stands for, but they know Dubai has turned into a synecdoche for the entire region. Though people recognize Dubai with all its wealth and exotic appeal, Yemen by contrast is the Middle East’s poorest country, and its government is in shambles. The country is poised to descend further into chaos, and there is a long and difficult road ahead if Yemen is to be rebuilt. The Houthis have a strong presence in the capital city of Sana’a but seldom find support elsewhere. A two-state solution, which is to say, reverting back to the pre-1990 unification, isn’t viable. The economic problems facing the country, particularly the extreme water shortage, make division into two nations problematic and frankly, unfeasible. Negotiations between the Houthis and the Hadi government in Aden must be made, and airstrikes must cease.
Athanasius Georgy is a sophomore majoring in economics. His column, “On the World Stage,” runs Thursdays.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and
peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria and Yemen will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an alcoholic.
Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that emphasizes
aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a band-aid
on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.
Here’s a more novel idea: take ownership of your posts.
Arafat, you post across Disqus bringing your brand of truthiness. Well, I concede you must be the honest one for all your posts. 
But you keep running away to post elsewhere and not taking your victory. So, here, take this reminder:
“Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And clever in their own sight!” Isaiah
So since you are so honest, you have no problem taking this oath: May the Lord deal justly between you and those who you call as liars, including myself, and condemn the one between us all who sows hate of others with their lies and distortions on all these Disqus posts. Amen.
I take that oath, do you?
Or do you acknowledge that your intent is to spread a hateful narrative intended to have someone act out on this inherent threat posed by these people?
Which is it? Are you honest or dishonest?
” In 2011, Saleh was swept away amid the fever of the Arab Spring. Many other dictators faced the same fate, and for a while it seemed as if Yemen was going to undergo a democratic makeover.”
++
This only seemed possible to those who do not understand that Islam and democracy are incompatible.  Islam is firmly against all things that define democracies including religious freedoms and rights, individual freedoms and rights, freedom of the press (to question and/or criticize).
Why Athanasius cannot seem to grasp this is really quite remarkable.

Maybe you forgot you had an essay to write. Or, maybe you just put it off until the last minute. Either way, it’s the night before your important paper is due and you are just relieved that you’re no longer staring at a blank screen. It can be tempting to submit your paper to Turnitin as soon as you finish it, but resist the urge. After all, what would your Writing 150 professor say if she or he saw your blatant disregard for the revision and editing processes? Here are a few quick tips for putting the finishing touches on your essay so that you can ensure it’s the best it can be.

1. Make a list of your personal “errors to avoid.” This means you need to be introspective for a few minutes. Think about surface-level grammar or spelling errors that you have struggled with in the past and write them down. By noting your most frequent errors, you can make sure to keep an eye out for any mistakes when you’re re-reading and editing. (Think their/there/they’re, it’s/its, your/you’re, etc. If you aren’t sure about when to use a semicolon, look it up).
2. Print out your essay. You’re probably going to be reluctant to waste valuable paper and ink on this, but it can be much easier to spot errors when you’re reading a hard copy. It enables you to circle any mistakes with a colored pen and make notes of places where you need to re-word a sentence or further analyze one of your points.
3. Read your paper out loud. Yes, you will feel silly and you will feel like you’re talking to yourself. Warn your roommate if you must. Our brains fill in gaps and correct errors when we read our own work. So ideally, you would get someone else to edit your paper for you. If that’s not an option, read it aloud and you will almost certainly hear places where your wording is awkward or where your grammar isn’t quite right. Don’t forget to read for organization and structure as well!
4. Remember, you’re not texting. This should go without saying, but assuming that your assignment is supposed to have an academic tone, you should most likely avoid personal pronouns. Capitalize and punctuate your sentences appropriately. It’s important.

Kale, nut butter, arugula, coconut oil — we’ve seen our fair share of superfood trends over the years that claim to offer consumers a clean bill of health.
A current top contender on the list is a small yet powerful tropical berry with celebrity spokespersons like Dr. Oz and Oprah advocating its various health benefits. It’s name is the acaí berry.
Originally found in the Amazon rainforests, this berry has made its way into the States and onto online retailer’s web pages and in the diets of many hoping to reap its supposed benefits.
Used by indigenous tribes to treat various ailments and to aid in speedy recovery, the berries are said to be chock-full of antioxidants, omega fatty acids and amino acids. Having more protein than an egg and promising to increase metabolic processes, decrease high cholesterol, boost immune health and reduce aging, acaí berries are rave-worthy.
The most common form acaí can be found in today’s food world are acaí bowls. These bowls are a great breakfast option as they start your day with vitamins and energy, but they can be enjoyed at any time of the day. The bowls consist of acaí berries (often in a puree or frozen smoothie pack form) blended with fresh or frozen fruit, and mixed with a base such as coconut milk. Various ingredients can be substituted for desired flavor and nutritional power, and bowls can be topped with toppings of choice-most often granola and fresh fruit.
A debate on how powerful, tasteful and beneficial the berries are compared to other fruit has been going on for years, with some claiming acaí bowls to just be over-glorified smoothies with added calories and sugar.
But do not dare criticize an acaí bowl if you have yet to try one.
Though acaí bowls can run high in sugar and calories, most ingredients are natural and still contain many health benefits. It might not be a good idea to indulge in these fruit bowls on a daily basis if you are worried about maintaining sugar and caloric intake, but they are still a great treat now and then.
You can whip up your own acaí bowl with this recipe. You will need fresh fruit and you’ll probably need to head to Amazon (the non-rainforest Amazon) to order a smoothie pack of acaí berries. Or if you live on or near campus-you’re in luck! One of my favorite food trucks, Amazebowls, claims a spot on the corner of Hoover and Jefferson on most school days from 9:30 to 7 p.m.
Amazebowls’ fun and vibrant purple truck draws students on a recurring basis who are craving a fruity and tasteful breakfast or snack in between classes.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Their menu, scribbled onto a colorful chalkboard, lists several bowls, smoothies and other extra treats such as homemade nut-butter.
The currently listed bowls include the original Amazebowl, the Fresh Prince of Bowl-Air, and the Rio Deal; just the names might be enough to persuade a prospective customer to purchase a bowl. All bowls are topped with hemp granola, agave, seasonal fruit, bananas and coconut shavings, but bowls can be customized upon request.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
The two listed smoothie flavors are the Cardinal and the Tropic Thunder, both blended with a variety of fruits. Pitaya bowls are made with a blend of dragon fruit pitaya instead of the acaí berries. Prices for the bowls range between $6.50 and $7.50, and the smoothies are $4 and $5.50. Though this might seem a bit pricey to some students, the smoothies and bowls that are filled with fresh fruit and acaí berries themselves are still worth it on occasion.
I always go for the original Amazebowl as it offers all of the flavors I’m looking for. The acaí blend is so refreshingly satisfying especially on a hot day, and the granola adds crunch and texture. The fresh fruit and coconut shavings tie the blend together smoothly and leave you craving more once your brightly colored spoon scrapes out the last of the contents of your bowl.

Amazebowls seems to love USC students as much as we love them. The food truck is a big sponsor for various student organizations. I’m constantly seeing posters telling me to stop by the truck to support various sports, academic and volunteer groups. When headed to Amazebowls, check to see if anyone is fundraising that day and say the “do-good” word related to the organization, and Amazebowls will donate a proceed of profits from every purchase that comes with the “do-good” word.
If you stop by tomorrow, Thursday, April 16 and give a high-five to the cashier when you order, Amazebowls will donate a percentage of your purchase to the National High Five Project, an organization working with Action for Healthy Kids to help fight childhood obesity and promote healthy living.
Regardless of whether you believe that acaí berries will give you the strength of a superhero or that they’re nothing out of the ordinary, acaí bowls are undeniably delicious. I would highly recommend you whip up your own blend or check out Amazebowls on your way to class for some purple goodness to brighten your day.

Time. In the United States, we never seem to have enough of it.  In Argentina, there is always more of it. This was one of the first things I noticed when coming to Buenos Aires, and, at first, it was one of the hardest things for me to adjust to.
I will admit that after a month and a half, I am fully adjusted to “porteño time,” or at least as much as I should let myself adjust, considering that I will be headed back to the States in just a few more months. Let me explain.
Argentines from Buenos Aires are called porteños. It is a running joke among expats and locals alike that the people of this city run on “porteño time.”  This means that starting and meeting times are typically loose – in some cases up to a half hour later than planned.  This usually isn’t too much of a bother and is easy to adjust to, except when you’re trying to get somewhere and the bus is late. At first, when the bus times would be off I would get very nervous about getting to class on time. I then realized that there was about a 10-minute cushion at the start of our schedule because our professors know that everyone has to deal with this public transit predicament. Traffic gets bad, trains break down, buses don’t come — it happens all the time and people are used to it and know to plan for it.  It is part of daily life here.
Aside from starting times, “porteño time” is also used to refer to the amount of time spent doing things. Argentines never seem to be in any rush and once you understand this and get used to it, it becomes a beautiful thing. For example, when you go to a restaurant or cafe, whether it is for a full meal or just a coffee, you should probably plan on being there at least an hour. Sometimes, meals last up to three hours or more if you are at someone’s home. Though it seems like a lot of time, it opens up a great opportunity to spend quality time with friends and family and never feel like you are being rushed along to your next commitment.
Along these lines, very much unlike those in the U.S., restaurants will never bring you your check unless you ask for it. It is seen as rude to give someone the bill as if you are rushing them to leave. So next time you are in Argentina and ready to leave, make sure you ask “la cuenta por favor” or you will be there all night.
Now you might be wondering, how do they have hours and hours to spend on coffee breaks and meal times?  I personally believe it is the time shift.  Argentine meal times are quite different than the U.S. and I think for this reason they have seemingly more hours in the day.
The work day starts similarly, 8 or 9 a.m., but Argentine’s don’t eat breakfast and if they do, its typically a coffee and maybe a small pastry — “medialunas,” small sweet croissants, are popular.  Lunch is typically between 1 and 3 p.m. and then in the afternoon, anytime between 5 to 7 p.m., they have their “merienda” or snack at a cafe.
Dinner is very late by U.S. standards, typically 10 p.m. to midnight. It can also start earlier and end later depending on the group. Then, if you are going out afterwards, your Argentine friends will insist on not getting to where you are going (club, party, etc.) before 2:30 a.m. because “nothing really gets fun until 3 or 4.”
This, on top of school or work, can definitely get tiring, but Argentines are used to getting about four to five hours of sleep a night. I find that they compensate for this lack of sleep with mate.
What is “mate” you ask? It is the traditional drink of Argentina and a huge part of their culture.  There is a mate herb that is packed into a special gourd-shaped cup with a straw that is called a “bombilla.” Water is then poured over it and when the herbs and water mix it makes a sort of tea that tastes much stronger and has a lot of caffeine similar to coffee.  It is enjoyed at all times of the day usually between friends, however it is not atypical for a complete stranger to pass you mate. When I was checking into my hostel in Iguazu a few weekends ago, I struck up a conversation with the man at the front desk and he offered me mate. We talked casually and passed the mate back and forth all the while waiting for my room to be ready. As a coffee and tea drinker, I personally enjoy the strong bitter taste of mate but not everyone does. Sometimes people mix it with sugar or juice to cut down the bite.
Now that I am aware of how “porteño time” works, I have completely embraced the lifestyle and I feel that I can accomplish even more in a day while rushing less.
