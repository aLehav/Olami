Earlier this week, Steve Masiello appeared to be on the upswing. He had just coached the Manhattan Jaspers to a near-upset of the Louisville Cardinals in the NCAA Tournament, coming oh-so-close to topping his mentor Rick Pitino in a battle of wits played out on a hardwood floor in Orlando, Fla. Masiello had played under Pitino as a walk-on at Kentucky and later honed his coaching skills for seven years alongside the tactical legend at Louisville. The Jaspers competed fiercely against the Cards, leading in the last two minutes, before falling valiantly 71-64.
Grantland’s Jordan Conn had followed Masiello and his team during preparation for and participation in March Madness, and the resulting (excellent) article painted Masiello as an expert game planner, effective motivator and a generally good guy who cared deeply about his players. By the end of the first weekend of NCAA Tournament play, multiple media outlets were reporting that Masiello had reached an agreement to become the head coach at the University of South Florida.
But that all changed after USF conducted a standard background check on Masiello,through which they discovered that he had not graduated from Kentucky. Masiello had attended UK from the fall of 1996 to the summer of 2000, but didn’t manage to walk away with a bachelor’s in communications, as his resume claimed.
USF rescinded its contract offer, and Manhattan placed Masiello on leave until he sorted out his degree status with Kentucky.
Within a week, Masiello had gone from being a no-name coach at a school with less than 4,000 students, to the leading candidate at a school in a respected mid-major conference where he’d receive a seven-figure annual salary, to a fibber with no guaranteed job at all.
The whole situation with Masiello is unfortunate. It certainly does not reflect well on his ethical standards that he would feel the need to exaggerate his academic credentials.
According to the job description posted by USF, the head coaching position “requires … a bachelor’s degree in an appropriate area of specialization and six years experience at the high school level or above.” By that measure, the school might have been correct in denying Masiello the job. If USF is truly steadfast in not hiring coaches without at least a bachelor’s degree, then he doesn’t meet the basic qualifications. And, quite honestly, his head coaching credentials aren’t all that impressive — Manhattan wasn’t the best team in their conference this year, only making the big dance after winning their conference tournament.
But if USF refused to hire him based solely on the fact that he told a white lie about not graduating — and likely being a credit or two short of earning the degree — then that seems quite silly to me.
Sure, they might face some initial backlash from fans and pundits who would wring their hands about what the resume-cushioning says about Masiello’s integrity. I can already hear Skip Bayless yelling, “What the University of South Florida has done here … is hire a liar to coach their student-athletes!”
But I would challenge USF to find anyone in their athletic department who hasn’t slightly embellished their accomplishments on their resume before, and there have certainly been equally poor or worse examples of coaches falsifying educational records, when the coaches still have gotten the benefit of the doubt and proven their future employers correct for trusting them.
George O’Leary was hired by Notre Dame back in 2001 to fill the school’s prestigious head football coaching post. Days after his appointment, it was discovered that not only had O’Leary never earned a master’s degree from “NYU-Stony Brook University” — but also that the school didn’t even exist. Notre Dame forced him to resign and O’Leary retreated to the NFL for a few years.
Now, O’Leary is the head coach at University of Central Florida, where he’s been since 2004. The Golden Knights had their best season in program history last year, logging an impressive 11-1 record before upsetting Baylor in the Fiesta Bowl as the biggest underdog in BCS bowl history. But his success hasn’t just been reflected in the Knights’ on-field performance; in his first season at the helm, the Knights set the school’s Division I-A record for team GPA. They’d surpass that mark the next season and place more student-athletes on Conference USA’s Commissioner Honor Roll than any other team. The squad’s cumulative GPA has continued to rise under O’Leary’s watch, from 2.78 in his first year to 2.99 in 2009.
Now, I’m not saying that Notre Dame was incorrect in forcing O’Leary to leave South Bend. But O’Leary making up a school is a far worse lie than Masiello saying he didn’t graduate from a school that he was probably quite close to obtaining a degree from. And Masiello shouldn’t be vilified for doing something that the vast majority of Americans probably do — albeit, untruthfully.
Still, ask yourself — do you want every company you apply to work for in the future to ensure that you’re really “conversationally proficient” in that obscure foreign language you took in college to satisfy that diversity requirement?

Mr. Laws,
A white Lie? He lied to his current employer and he lied to his future employer. That is not acceptable. He deserves to be fired. Besides, how do you know that he may have been “a few credits short” of a degree…..maybe he quit school, maybe he flunked out…..in any event he said he had a degree when he didn’t and he kept saying it years after he left Kentucky when he could have rectified the situation. I worked my tail off at USC getting two degrees…a B.S. and an M.B.A………working at the same time I was going to school. I am very proud of my degrees and to be a Trojan and I resent people claiming academic credentials when they didn’t earn them. I am also disappointed in you for making excuses for them.

The USC women’s water polo team scored early and often Thursday afternoon against Hartwick College in the friendly confines of the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The No. 1 Women of Troy (19-0, 4-0 MPSF) defeated the Hawks (15-9) by a final score of 21-5.
Leading the charge · Freshman Stephania Haralabidis had four goals in her team’s 21-5 drubbing of Hartwick. Haralabidis has 41 goals this year.- Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Coming off a dominant three-game series in Hawaii, junior driver and reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week Monica Vavic did not waste any time continuing her scoring streak. After winning the opening possession, Vavic found herself in prime position to strike a shot past the outstretched Hawk goalie, giving USC a 1-0 lead just 21 seconds into the game. Unfortunately for Hartwick, the Women of Troy’s scoring did not end there.
As the first quarter came to a close, senior driver Olivia Cummins delivered a beautiful touch shot that arched over Hartwick’s defense to give USC an 8-2 advantage. In the opening period, freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis displayed her vast arsenal of scoring abilities, using both a forceful line drive and two skip shots to find the back of the cage and net an early hat trick.
The “score early” concept was not abandoned. Just 14 ticks into the second quarter, Haralabidis dished out her second assist of the game to Vavic on a two-on-one fast break. USC’s No. 6 all-time leading scorer was not done there. With just under three minutes remaining in the first half, senior goalie Flora Bolonyai corralled a big save and tossed a long outlet pass to the streaking Vavic, who registered yet another score to give her the hat trick and give the Women of Troy a 13-2 lead.
Jumping back into the pool after intermission trailing 14-2, the Hawks displayed their best defense to open the quarter, not allowing USC to get an open shot or hold onto the ball. Almost three minutes into the half, however, senior captain Maddie Rosenthal found senior driver Kelly Mendoza, who was able to deliver a rocket past the inside post with defenders draped on her shoulders to end the short offensive draught.
Junior driver Jennifer Stiefel was able to plug in two more for the Women of Troy in the period before Hartwick finally made its presence known and registered its lone third-quarter tally on the scoreboard with just under a minute to play. Awaiting the horn to signal the end of the period, freshman driver Ioanna Haralabidis took advantage of the slow Hawk defense and punched in another goal to give USC a 19-3 lead going into the final quarter.
Bolonyai, the MPSF leader in fewest goals against, was relieved after three brilliant quarters of work — recording eight saves — by freshman Melanie Slater.
The Women of Troy pulled back on the scoring brigade in the final quarter, focusing on their defensive strategy and allowing some fresh faces to record valuable experience. Though the game play changed, the intensity did not. Head coach Jovan Vavic remained enthusiastic, commanding his troops and taking advantage of every opportunity to correct any miscues, despite holding a commanding lead.
The Hawks were able to break away and had a scoring chance late in the game, but Slater remained poised, punching it away off the crossbar. A late bank shot off the post by senior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist capped things off.
Next in line for USC is a trip up the coast to play No.8 San Jose State and a rematch of last year’s NCAA National Championship game against No. 3 Stanford.
“We have been looking forward to this game [against Stanford] for the past 5 or 6 weeks so we are really excited about it. It’s going to be interesting because we haven’t played them yet so we don’t know what type of a game plan they are going to have,” said Vavic. “We know their strengths and they know our strengths. These are two teams that know each other very well so it will be a great game.”

Heading into his team’s fifth spring practice, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian was worried about his players’ energy. Tuesday’s practice was the first post-spring break session, and Saturday’s practice will be the team’s first at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, so Thursday’s practice had all the makings of a sluggish day.
Elder statesman · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams figures to be the key cog in the Trojans’ young defensive line. Williams recorded 74 tackles (13.5 of them for loss) last year on his way to All-American season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In keeping with Sarkisian’s up-tempo philosophy, though, the team showed no signs of slowing down.
“It’s easy to be fired up on Tuesday coming off of spring break, and we know on Saturday, going to the Coliseum, they’re gonna be fired up for that,” Sarkisian said. “We wanted to make sure that today we came out with a lot of energy and intensity … and I thought the guys really responded to that.”
With an entirely new defensive coaching staff, the unit remains in flux. But Sarkisian is trying to focus on the similarities between last year’s defensive scheme and this year’s to ease the transition.
“There’s only so many defenses you can run,” Sarkisian said. “There are probably some similarities in our base front — they  were a 5-2 a year ago, we’re a 3-4 hybrid. We’ll probably rely on being in that 3-4 a little more than they did.”
Good  vibrations
Given the abrupt nature of former head coach Ed Orgeron’s departure and the loyalty that he was able to establish among current players, some concern lingered about how quickly Sarkisian would be able to “win over” the players.
That appears to have been accomplished, as players have been very receptive to the new coaching staff’s instruction. The vibe around the team is as positive as it’s been in quite some time.
“Everything is positive, even when you make a mistake,” redshirt freshman cornerback Chris Hawkins said. “We’re having fun — even in meetings. We’re listening to music in meetings while [coach] is talking, so we’re all grooving and taking notes. They keep us uplifted.”
With the players’ spirits consistently high, Sarkisian has been pleased with their receptiveness to the staff’s criticism and instruction.
“What I’ve been impressed by with this group is when I give them things to work on in the upcoming practice, they really try to apply it,” Sarkisian said. “That’s a sign of a team that wants to do well and wants to do the things the coaches are asking of them.”
That type of attitude will be especially useful on the defensive side, where several younger players will be thrust into starting roles, especially on the defensive line.
“[The new guys] are coming along great,” said redshirt senior linebacker Hayes Pullard. “Everybody’s messing up, we’re all learning the same new defense and they’re fixing it the next day, which shows maturity for a young guy.”
New Faces
With the departure of key players such as George Uko and Morgan Breslin, the Trojan defensive line was expected to have new contributors this year. But with junior defensive end Leonard Williams still out while recovering from surgery, even more new players have been forced into larger roles.
One of those players, redshirt junior Delvon Simmons, is more experienced than most. A transfer from Texas Tech, Simmons sat out last season due to NCAA rules but looks ready to contribute immediately. Simmons made 40 tackles in two seasons for the Red Raiders, including three sacks and two pass deflections.
“We have a lot of big guys,” Williams said. “We have a lot of potential on the D-line. Delvon has been doing a great job so far. We still need a lot more work, but we have enough time.”
Williams said he wouldn’t be practicing at full strength until the summer. Other inexperienced players on the defensive line include redshirt sophomore Jeff Miller and redshirt freshman Kenny Bigelow. Both took reps with the starting defense.
QUICK HITS
Saturday’s practice at the Coliseum will be the team’s first in full pads. Sarkisian said that there would be a roughly 10-minute, 25-play period with live tackling. “They’re chomping at the bit,” Sarkisian said. “The defensive guys — they want to go tackle some guys.”
Sarkisian said that he plans to start fall practices at 8:15 a.m., instead of the normal 4 p.m. Saturday’s practice will start at 11 a.m.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism will offer a new course next fall semester that utilizes Google Glass technology inside the classroom.
Robert Hernandez, assistant professor of Professional Practice at Annenberg, will be leading the class, titled “Glass Journalism,” that he developed with students across different schools, including Annenberg and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
The main focus of the course will be to create content that will be consumed and experienced through Google Glass and to create Glass apps by the end of the course. The course aims to develop a new form of storytelling.
This technology can change how information is relayed in journalism, Hernandez said. He is curious to see how, for example, National Public Radio will function on the platform, as well as how breaking news will be featured.
The class will consist of 12 to 15 students who will be divided into teams to create Glass apps that can be released to the public. David Carr, a sophomore majoring in computer science and part of the collaboration team that developed the course content, noted that the students will come from a wide range of academic backgrounds and majors so that each can contribute his or her own expertise in building a valuable app.
“The neat thing about this class is that everything about it is open-ended,” Carr said.
Hernandez said his main goal is to revolutionize the way news is told by creating an interactive form of practicing journalism. Hernandez also wants to abandon the practice of “shovelware,” where a new medium does not necessarily entail an improvement in news coverage — such as when television was essentially radio with pictures.
“That’s not really taking advantage of the media,” Hernandez said.
Hernandez hopes to do the opposite with Glass as it can potentially change how news stories are created, consumed and experienced. Though Glass is the “shiny new object that got everyone’s attention,” he would like to see news stories that are optimized for Glass in the future, using high-tech features such as hands-free method of operation as an advantage.
“The point here is to collaborate, to embrace technology, to be proactive,” Hernandez said.
Jessie Wong, a junior majoring in public relations and part of the collaboration team, said the course has the power to influence how Google Glass will be used in the future. She hopes the technology will open up possibilities to integrate the new with the old and have the two work harmoniously.
“We have a really good opportunity here to shape how this technology can be used,” Wong said. “It’s almost like you’re practicing journalism on a different medium, different style, but still doing the same core tasks.”
The class will be centered on       real-life application of the skill sets the students have already learned. The key is the culture of collaboration, in which different types of students come together and work as equals, Hernandez said.
“It’s not I work for you, you work for me,” he said. “We’re exploring and collaborating and building this together.”
Hernandez stressed that the role students play in this class will be significantly different from the traditional standard, and the usual method of professors determining the course content will not be applied.
“I’m not teaching this class, I’m facilitating and leading the class,” Hernandez said.
Any student is welcome to take the class, as Hernandez believes each student will offer different expertise to the project. He described the class as an “open sandbox,” where students are free to explore and determine the direction the class takes.
Though the class emphasizes students becoming familiar with Glass, the ultimate goal is to encourage teamwork and to instill the importance of technology experience.
“Even if Google Glass is a failure, think of all the successes we get out of it,” Hernandez said, “We are going to determine if this is a success or a failure. It’s on us.”

USC has launched a free emergency preparedness program, the Community Emergency Preparedness Project, within the surrounding community.
The pilot version of the program has been running since March 7 and will end on April 25. It intends to fully prepare both USC and the surrounding areas for possible emergencies by providing Community Emergency Response Training, Citizen Corps neighborhood team planning and family preparedness training.
William Regensburger, director of fire safety and emergency planning at USC, said he has noticed that many people in the local area want to volunteer but cannot afford to pay for the emergency response kit that is required for the course.
Regensburger has asked for a grant to cover these costs and help better prepare the community in the event of a disaster. If the grant is awarded, the program will officially begin in July and will include a variety of emergency preparedness courses.
Currently, the university has a team of approximately 300 people trained in emergency preparedness, but the surrounding communities are not nearly as prepared. Regensburger said he has desired to start a program such as this one for a long time, but felt more pressure recently.
“Especially with the recent earthquake that has occurred, it seems necessary to make sure our community would be prepared in the event of a major disaster,” he said.
Regensburger, along with Erroll Southers, associate director for research transition of the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, reached out to various student organizations, staff and community members to participate in the pilot program.
Gregory Papazian, a graduate student within the Price School of Public Policy and a participant in the program, noted that the university’s outreach is part of a continuing mission to better the surrounding area.
“USC has a great tradition of community service, and offering this training in a bilingual format highlights the fact that USC cares deeply about safety on campus and in our surrounding neighborhood,” Papazian said.
He went on to note that being in the course revealed the local area’s willingness to learn.
“As a participant in the class, I have seen the power of community collaboration while also learning some practical skills I can use in case of an earthquake or other emergency,” Papazian said.
Lynn Cohen, president of the           First-In Fire Foundation — one of the nonprofits working with USC — said the classes have shown students what emergency preparedness really is.
Some of the other classes involve learning how to put out fires, how to do search and rescue in a building and the practice of drills simulating mock emergencies.
Regensburger hopes that providing this course will help make the community more self-sufficient in the event of an emergency.
“I want to see the neighborhood do as well as the university and recover well,” Regensburger said.
USC is the first university in the nation to extend an emergency response team to its surrounding neighborhood, Regensburger said.  In addition to working with nonprofit organizations, USC will also be collaborating with the fire department, the police department, the emergency management department, the department of public safety, faith-based networks and community members.
For the duration of the program, the classes are held on Fridays from     9 a.m. to 12 p.m. in Newman Hall at the Caruso Catholic Center.

Achieving tolerance in sports has long been an elusive goal. Despite various strides made by those in the soccer world to curb racism on the field — from cracking down on racist remarks between players to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association announcing the decision to allow players to sport religious head garments during games — Japanese soccer officials chose a new approach: emptying the stadium. On Sunday, Japanese officials ordered premier J-League team the Urawa Red Diamonds to play for an empty audience as punishment for allowing fans to display racist signs during their March 8 match, according to Time. Though it was an unusual form of punishment, holding the team accountable for its fans and their actions sends a strong message to both the soccer community and the world.
Design by Julien Nicolai
The punishment came as a result of allowing fans in the stadium to put up racist signs reading “Japanese Only” in one of the entranceways of the stadium as a means of discouraging foreign fans from sitting in certain sections. What made the incident truly disturbing, however, was not merely the presence of the racist banners, but what the team didn’t do to address it.
“The team management says they learned about the banner being put up about an hour into the game,” Kirk Spitzler, Time’s Tokyo correspondent, told Public Radio International. “They said that they did not deem this to be racist, discriminatory or derogatory towards foreigners so they left it up.”
This isn’t the first time the Urawa Red Diamonds faced trouble with its fans. In 2010, the team was fined approximately $50,000 after their fans were found making taunting remarks toward the foreign players on the opposing team.
The fans responsible for the banners said they did not have any racist or derogatory intentions and that they merely didn’t want foreigners to sit with them in fear that they wouldn’t be able to fully understand and participate in the cheers. Upon further investigation, security guards in the stadium reported hearing discriminatory remarks made against foreigners. J-League officials decided to ban those responsible for the banners, and ordered the Urawa Red Diamonds to play their next game for an empty stadium — a decision that not only lost them an audience, but approximately more than $1 million in ticket sales, according to Public Radio International.
Though some might consider the punishment unfair toward the players who were ultimately not responsible for the actions of those in the stadium, the penalty sends the strong message to the rest of the soccer world: that such acts of discrimination don’t simply affect those to which they are aimed at, but that they truly affect everyone. By showing fans that such actions don’t simply result in pledges to “stamp out racism,” but rather result in real consequences, such actions can finally be taken seriously.
Sportsmanship isn’t just limited to the field. We can’t expect our players and officials to live up to certain standards of professionalism without holding those same expectations for their viewers. Hopefully in the 2014 FIFA World Cup this summer, fans will make the wise decision to leave the discriminatory banners behind.

Last Sunday, gone were the loud cheers and shouts that usually echo through Japan’s Saitama Stadium at home matches. Instead, when the Urawa Red Diamonds walked out onto the field, the team was met with a deafening silence.
Design by Julien Nicolai
To punish a small group of fans for hanging a “Japanese Only” banner in the stadium entranceway at a home game on March 8, the Japanese government ordered the team to play in an empty stadium, according to Time. Though this stunt certainly makes a loud statement against racism, the method itself is both unnecessary and ineffective. The fans, not the team, were the true culprits in this situation.
To be clear, the banner and its implications were indeed racist in nature. The fans said the sole purpose of the banner was to discourage foreigners from sitting in that section, but security guards reported hearing “discriminatory remarks” toward foreigners.
The Urawa Red Diamonds team, however, did step up to the plate, taking effective measures to control and prevent the situation.
More than anything, this seems to be a case of misdirected discipline. The fans were the ones who made the violation, so why should the team be punished to such an extent for a misdemeanor their fans were responsible for? The team officials had already taken effective and reasonable measures by indefinitely banning 20 members of the group responsible for the banners. The team president, in an act to demonstrate his genuine apologies for not having taken down the banners during the game, said he’d give up three months of his salary. In considering this, the team bore its share of the burden. To prevent future recurrences, the team, according to the Bangkok Times, has imposed an indefinite ban on fans displaying banners and flags at both home and away games. The team has shown sincerity in wanting to do right and to combat racism, so there was no reason for last Sunday’s additional embarrassing punishment.
In a brief ceremony before the game on Sunday, team captain Yuki Abe said that the players pledged to “stamp out racism, be it discrimination against race, skin color, gender, language or religion or background, and will not tolerate any discriminatory or insulting language or behavior.” This pledge, though the message is spot-on, could have gotten across easily without emptying the 63,700-capacity stadium, replacing advertisement with signs promoting the United Nation’s Sports of Peace program and canceling the entrance music.
Though the punishment is unprecedented, fans’ misbehavior is not. The Urawa Reds team has been punished for fan misbehavior multiple times in the past, according to the New Straits Times. In 2010, the team was fined $50,000 for their fans’ racist verbal abuse toward the Japanese team Vegalta Sendai’s foreign players. Though this isn’t the first time that the team had to bear the brunt of the punishment, it should certainly be the last — not only because it is ineffective, as evidenced by the recurrence of racial malice, but also because it is unfair to the team.
As Brazil gears up for the 2014 FIFA World Cup this summer, it should definitely learn from the measures taken here to combat racism. After all, it wouldn’t go well if that brand-new, purpose-built stadium of 52,048 capacity to go unappreciated for the sake of a public stunt trying to make an ineffective statement that will show disrespect to the teams and bar peace-loving, soccer-impassioned spectators from coming to enjoy a sport loved by so many cultures and nations.

Hitting the culprits in the wallet has been shown to be an effective measure to take to at least make people less inclined to show their racism and for organizations to enforce the rules on the books. While racism is still rampart in the US, for example, the potential perpetrators are now inclined to think twice, not out of any moral obligation (ideal world) but out of fear of financial penalty and restitution to the victims. Besides with 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo looming, japan simply can’t afford to show any leniency as they have since forever. Imagine if the world begins to label japan as a racist country.  No, this was a great move PR wise for a country looking to keep its minor efforts towards ending tolerance of racist and xenophobic attitudes quiet as kept, and might raise awareness enough for some more significant measures to be taken in the future…one can only hope. For the record I have lived in japan for 10 years, three of those in the shadow of this stadium in Urawa, so I speak from experience on the ground
I suspect that the teams playing that day regarded the silence of Saitama Stadium as a novelty and did not mind it at all for that one game. Perhaps the Urawa Reds home team even felt noble for sacrificing their home team fans’ enthusiasm for the single game.
Look at it the other way:  there will always be individuals who are racists. But the worst racism is institutional. This is a good example of an institution doing the opposite – working at combatting racism, a desirable development.
Nice try, Valerie, but you can find, and write about, worse outrages than this encouraging incident of an organization doing the right thing.

Lately, I’ve been feeling very British. For example, yesterday I was sitting on the tube reading the London Evening Standard newspaper and avoiding eye contact with everyone around me like only seasoned tube passengers know how to do, when some boisterous Americans disturbed my peaceful ride with unnecessarily loud talking and laughter.
I was irked until I remembered that I’m one of them. Just the other day I was doing the same thing with my American friends as Brits gave us some dirty looks on public transportation.
This realization got me thinking about the global perception of Americans. In a sea of British accents, I can’t help but feel like sometimes my voice is an alarm screeching, “Hey, over here! Look at me! I’m a loud, annoying American!” That American accent differentiates me from everyone else, whether I like it or not.
I might care a little too much about what others think, but personally I don’t enjoy the idea of being disliked by anyone, even if it is based on something as trivial as my nationality. Besides, the United States is the land of the free and the home of the brave. What’s not to like?
There’s no arguing with the United States’ world influence. Even on the other side of the Atlantic, the actions of U.S. politicians and celebrities still make headlines and talk of the United States is somehow always present in international classrooms. The Brits watch our movies, play our music, eat our food, use our technology — I could keep going.
Back home, however, it is a commonly accepted belief that Americans aren’t exactly the most well-liked group around the world. It’s stressful to think that the whole world might hate you without bothering to get to know you. I decided it was time I find out for myself if this assumption is true, and I’ve been paying close attention during my time overseas to get to the bottom of this mystery.
When asked about British peoples’ general attitude toward Americans, one of my professors here in London characterized us as “lovable, but loud,” a relatively accurate description, as far as I can tell, and a hopeful sign that any bad blood from the Revolution is all but gone.
I also spoke with a British guy I met at a restaurant who has traveled throughout Europe and Asia, but has never had a desire to go to the United States.
“Isn’t it all freeways and McDonald’s?” he asked me unironically.
So I guess our reputation still could use some work, but in my experience at least, British people are interested in the United States, somewhat amused by us and polite at all times except on their commute.
The real test, however, was this past weekend when I visited Paris for the first time. The relationship between the French and Americans has always seemed volatile to me. The animosity between these two nations’ citizens was a plot point in the seminal classic Rush Hour 3, and I remember a time when some patriots tried to convince the U.S. population to use the phrase “freedom fries” to take a stand against France via one of our most beloved side dishes.
I had no idea what to expect in France because I wasn’t sure if the rumors were true. At the first opportunity, I went to the source to find out the truth: my French tour guide. A very nice woman herself, the guide told me that the French do not hate Americans on sight. They do, however, really value manners, and the only reason they might be a little rude is if they feel like they have been disrespected first. Therefore, it’s possible that the U.S. culture is just more casual than France, and this whole rivalry is a giant misunderstanding. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Paris is a friendly place and all stereotypes are without merit.
Though I have yet to find myself in any dramatic encounters with angry Europeans, there is an undeniable reaction from people here when they learn my classmates and I are American. Everyone has an opinion, positive or negative, about the United States, undoubtedly because of the country’s immense reach.
Regardless of their opinion of our country, I don’t think that foreigners hold anything against us as citizens. If anything, we’re their connection to the source of much of their entertainment. Maybe we are a little louder or a little less refined, but they can’t say we don’t have a lot to offer the world.
Thus, I’ve concluded that the world’s hatred of Americans is grossly exaggerated, but their fascination with us couldn’t be emphasized enough. Mystery solved.

The college application process has become incredibly rigorous and cutthroat. According to the Independent Educational Consultants Association, the average cost of a private admissions consultant is $4,035, and 26 percent of the high-achieving incoming freshmen at private universities hired a consultant. A lot of these consultants then keep a database of previous clients’ application files for reference, which they use to help future clients who can afford their services.
AdmitSee.com, an East Coast-based startup, is attempting to level the higher education playing field by providing an affordable alternative to hiring a private admissions counselor. The new website allows users to access a database of profiles by students currently enrolled at different universities across the country, which include varying levels of information about their own college applications.
The site’s goal is to facilitate a deeper level of connection with the actual applicants by exposing them to private information from past profiles. It’s an individualized approach; instead of profile submitters being pushed into a book of generic college application essays, each student has the opportunity to distinguish him or herself and go into more detail about the personal details of his or her application so that he or she can then help those currently applying.
“We’re basically cutting out the middleman by allowing college students to post their own profiles online,” said Lydia Fayal, co-founder of the site, in an email interview. “And the college students get paid — I can guarantee you that the private consultants aren’t sending checks to their old clients for sharing their files.”
Fayal explained that when someone buys a profile, 50 percent goes to the college student who shared the content, aka the “Admit,” five percent goes to the person who referred the “Admit” and five percent goes to the person who referred the buyer. The remaining amount is used for digital marketing and new features.
AdmitSee is essentially a cross between a social media platform and an e-commerce site. It has an easy-to-navigate layout that the creators tried to make similar to Facebook; they have also packaged profiles by essay topic — so, for example, if students want to write a college essay on medical career aspirations, they can see how other people have done it. Fayal said that they’re also currently working on creating packages for controversial topics (e.g. battling depression, overcoming a financial obstacle, explaining a disciplinary action) so as to really provide a variety.
“We have some really crazy essays,” Fayal said. “For instance, one guy wrote about his father’s addiction to pornography — he got into Yale. I think our site inspires people to take risks with their essays. They can search for keywords like cancer, death … even pornography, and they’ll get a list of students who have written on that topic.”
This is one of the ways AdmitSee distinguishes itself from other companies that offer the same service. For example, Princeton Review college essay books are one of its main sources of competition, but AdmitSee contends that it offers more in-depth and personal information and hones in on specific demographics that match up to a user’s background. They also include information such as the major applied to, number of Advanced Placement classes taken, etc. The point is for students to learn, based on the applications people submitted to the schools that they themselves are interested in, what they could do to bolster their own applications.
In order to avoid plagiarism, Fayal says that they upload all essays to Turnitin, a software used by the overwhelming majority of top 100 schools — including USC -— to flag essays for plagiarism. They also go through all the essays personally to check for quality.
In terms of verification, the site confirms students using their school IDs, so applicants will know they’re getting material from a real college student versus a troll from College Confidential. When someone uploads his or her school ID, they get a green checkmark on his or her profile picture. The student  has six months to upload their student ID, after which the profile gets taken down.  AdmitSee is also very focused on global expansion because writing application essays is especially difficult for international applicants. They currently have an exclusive partnership with Ivy Gate, the most well-known college prep company in Hong Kong, that’s promoting the site in exchange for discount access.
As far as plans for the future, the company is planning on rolling out additional levels of verification for students who send  a PDF of their common application and test scores. AdmitSee decided to wait on these items because it didn’t want to scare off potential admits until they reached critical mass (the company now has more than 1,300 profiles).
 
This would have been so helpful when I was applying to college! Such a great idea. It is so helpful to hear advice from students who have actually gone through the process!
Wow, this is great. I really wished that I had something like this when I was applying for college. This unique resource would be highly beneficial to high school students.
Nice how this can serve as a source of both information and inspiration. Guide you and inspire you.
It’s like the best information from college confidential and other sites is pressed into one convenient system. I browsed through a ton of pages on CC reading the admission statistics of the several dozen people who post there, this site definitely makes it easier
Great idea, I remember trying so hard with no avail to find essay examples and tips related specifically to the schools I was applying to. This would have made my application process so much better.
Awesome concept. This is a great idea for students. I wish this was around when I was applying to schools. Everyone should try Admitsee.
The basic idea of letting admits help applicants in such a way is, to me, very reasonable. Everyone gets what he wants at a reasonable cost. I’ll definitely share this info with my peers.
I wish I’d had this when applying to college too– I really had no idea what kinds of extracurriculars other people were doing to get into good schools.
Cool concept. I especially like that you can read all the students’ essay intros for free. I wish I had this when I was applying to USC.

For thrift store-lovers and garage sale-shoppers alike, there is nothing more rewarding than digging through an old box of goods and unearthing the gem that you have always been looking for. Now, combine that with a passion for vintage and home design, and what you get is Downtown Modernism, the second annual market for vintage modern design coming to Los Angeles this Sunday.
Can we go thrift shopping? · Channel your inner Macklemore this weekend at Modernica’s event, Los Angeles Downtown Modernism. – Photo courtesy of Downtown Modernism
 
The event is hosted by Modernica, a manufacturer of modern furniture. Though the company is not selling its own furniture, it is creating the opportunity for collectors, connoisseurs and treasure hunters to sift through mid-century, modernist and vintage artifacts from the company’s hand-picked group of furniture, lighting and décor design dealers.
“We’re going to have over 85 booths, from the best dealers that are around Southern California — and it’s not just dealers, but also collectors that are coming to sell their collections,” said Director of E-commerce Cara King. “There are a lot of things that aren’t currently out in stores that people can come find. It’s a real treasure hunt.”
Though not every single item sold is specifically from the mid-century — with some products erring on the earlier side, others on the later — King said that what separates this marketplace from others going on around Los Angeles and in other cities is the unique time period in which it finds itself.
“There aren’t many venues where all of the dealers of this nature can really come together, so it was about recreating that shopping experience to bring the best vintage modern designs of Southern California together,” King said. “There’s events like the [Rose Bowl Flea Market], but that’s more inclusive to clothing and to a larger date range, as opposed to being more of a focus on modernism specifically.”
Furthermore, the location couldn’t be more fitting. Architecture and interior design’s mid-century modern period ranges from approximately 1933 to 1965, The movement is said to have originated in Los Angeles and picked up speed with the well-known Case Study Program. The style emphasizes clean lines, bold colors, organic shapes and industrial materials.
“[The event] does tie closely into our business, but that is the love of the owners,” King said. “They’re very excited about that time period.”
Having a furniture company host the event — taking place on its factory premises outdoors and sprawling across five acres — also proved beneficial when it came to selecting the participating dealers.
“The owners of Modernica are huge furniture enthusiasts, and we also have a props house, so we have a vast network of people that we deal with,” King said. “Some of it is personal invitation, and then also some of it is word of mouth as well.”
Though Downtown Modernism is only in its second year, there has already been an overwhelmingly positive response from both sides of the market.
“Everything was really positive that came back from the shoppers and from the dealers,” King said. “We have most of the dealers returning from last year, and we had attendants — probably between 1,500 and 2,000 — last year, and we expect that amount back.”
In addition to displaying furniture and other small objects such as pottery, Modernica has organized partnerships with multiple local businesses featuring food vendors and gourmet coffee, making it an enjoyable experience for shoppers of all ages, backgrounds and levels of interest.
“We’re working with Downtown Dog Rescue, and they’ll have some dogs available for adoption,” King said. “We also will have some food and coffee on site. We’ve got Cafecito Organico and Border Grill and Sweet Lucie’s Ice Cream will be there.”
 
Downtown Modernism will be held at 2901 Saco St., Los Angeles, CA 90058. The event is open to the public and tickets can be purchased for $5 at the venue.

With every Major League Baseball team but the Dodgers and Diamondbacks kicking off their season on March 30 and last minute Fantasy Drafts coming even earlier, round out your picks for corner infielders and middle infielders, with some of the best sleepers in the remaining positions.
Left Field 
Of all the outfield spots, and really any position but first base and pitcher, this is the deepest position with quality talent from top (like Mike Trout and Carlos González) to middle (like the underappreciated Matt Holliday and Bryce Harper) to bottom (with honorable mention sleepers like Adam Eaton and Carlos Quentin), it’s pretty hard to go wrong here unless you go with Starling Marte, Alex Gordon or Domonic Brown. Despite all these solid options, there’s one name that stands out as being madly undervalued:
Khris Davis, Milwaukee Brewers
The Brewers left fielder is a promising pick, and it’s not just because his name is a much cooler spelling of the name of last year’s breakout, Chris Davis. Like his fellow Davis in Baltimore, Khris Davis has enormous power potential, which he put on full display in the second half of last year, totaling 11 home runs in 136 at bats. Over a full season, that’s around 50 home runs. Even if he can’t sustain this pace, he would, at the very minimum settle right around 30, which I think we would all take in the 23rd round he’s averaging in the fantasy draft. If he can trade in some home runs for a cut down strikeout rate, he will be fantasy gold. He’ll be coming out of left field in Milwaukee, but his upcoming breakout year definitely won’t.
Center Field
Believe it or not, center field is shallow this year, with consistently overrated players like Adam Jones and Carlos Gomez being promoted as top dogs. The move for 2014 would seem to be to nab a top guy like Trout, Andrew McCutchen or Jacoby Ellsbury; play it sneaky and wait for Ryan Braun to gain CF eligibility; wait on Jason Heyward; or stick to the spirit of March, take the 16 seed of Center Fielders and select:

Grady Sizemore, Boston Red Sox
No one but blind homers of the Red Sox, huge fans of the Cleveland Indians and Grady Sizemore’s family think of drafting Grady Sizemore. He may be dropping off most fan’s radar now that Red Sox management is reportedly considering starting current center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., despite hitting just .188 in spring so far. Sizemore hasn’t been a factor in baseball since Barack Obama first started campaigning for change, but now it’s time to campaign for Sizemore’s big return as he’s finally healthy and in the hands of a steady organization, which is instrumental in situations like these. The 31-year old is hitting an impressive .303 in his first action in three years, with a homerun to boot. Although it is only spring training and most would like to see him steal more (he doesn’t have a stolen base yet), he is being cautiously watched and this sort of activity is sure to ramp up soon. This is a guy with major potential that should definitely be considered as your number one option if the everyone else is taken.
Right Field
Right field is a bit of a weird position; you pretty much know what you’re going to get out of this crop of batters. Sure, Josh Hamilton’s intriguing, but I don’t see much of an improvement over last year. My answer to this corner outfield position has always been José Bautista; I’m pretty sure I’ve drafted Joey Bats in every league I’ve been in for the last four years without ever having to overpay for him. Yeah, he’s left my team with an injury at the end of every season, but he’s just so good and undervalued for the first part of it that I keep coming back. Shane Victorino is in the Matt Holliday and Aramis Ramírez tier of underrated studs. Everyone else you can expect to achieve what they’re projected to, so you can’t really gain on any value, that is, except for this guy:
Jason Heyward, Atlanta Braves
Although Heyward isn’t as much of a sleeper as the rest of the guys, Heyward is still overlooked, but not for good reason. The Braves’ former budding superstar was supposed to be the next Barry Bonds, but everyone forgets because of how disappointing he’s been. Just like Eric Hosmer was supposed to be the next big thing at first, Heyward was supposed to be the next five-tool player in right. And, just like Hosmer started to turn it around last year, Heyward is about to turn it around this year. He had 27 home runs and 21 stolen bases two years ago, but 152 strikeouts with only 58 walks. Even though he was injured for half of last season and played injured for half of that time, he still managed only 10 walks less, showing a clear improvement in his plate discipline, which can only bode well for the rest of his stats over the course of a full, healthy season. With no health concerns of any sort, expect Heyward to put it all together and justify his former superstar billing.
Relief Pitcher
Closers, depending on your league settings, can be so important that it becomes vital to draft the top 5 guys (Kimbrel, Jansen, Holland, Rosenthal and Chapman), or can be so insignificant that it’s best to get the best possible $1/last round pick guys. Aside from that, there’s not much to say about them. After all, they’re closers, but if you have to pick one, look at:
Joakim Soria, Texas Rangers
This pick would’ve looked way cooler when I decided on it two weeks ago before Soria was officially given the closer job over Neftalí Feliz, but he’s still ranked as the 23rd best closer on ESPN, so that’s sleeper enough for me. Let me enumerate the many reasons why Soria needs to be on your team. First, for those of you that don’t remember, the former Kansas City Royals reliever managed 43 saves at his peak in 2010, with fantastic 1.05 WHIP and 1.78 ERA, not to mention a solid K/9 above 9. He’s a year removed from Tommy John surgery, which is always the formula for success. Being the captain of the Rangers relief committee, he will have plenty of opportunities to save games for this potential first place team.
Starting Pitcher
In all my years of playing Fantasy Sports, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a position so deep as starting pitcher this year.  The strategy with pitching is to wait on it until the end of the draft and stack up on hitting because even though the saturated market for pitching SHOULD dampen the value, I guarantee your leaguemates won’t recognize this and will draft them as high as in years past. Because of the incredible volume of good pitchers late, instead of just picking one, I’ll list all the ones outside of the top 50 on ESPN’s Starting Pitcher Rankings. Without further ado:
1.      Dan Straily, Oakland Athletics
2.      Francisco Liriano, Pittsburgh Pirates
3.      AJ Burnett, Pittsburgh Pirates
4.      Clay Buchholz, Boston Red Sox
5.      Iván Nova, New York Yankees
6.      Chris Archer, Tampa Bay Rays
7.      Rick Porcello, Detroit Tigers

The USC Special Events Committee hosted a pre-screening of HBO’s Game of Thrones Season 4 for an audience of more than 800 in Bovard Auditorium Wednesday evening.
Game of Thrones, the television adaption of the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, premiered in April 2011 to critical acclaim, garnering a numerous awards and nominations as well as a loyal fan base. The show is now on its fourth season, which will premiere on April 6.

The evening was a collaboration between the Special Events Committee and HBOCollege.
“We had worked with HBO last semester with The Newsroom, and then they brought up the idea of potentially doing a Game of Thrones pre-screening this semester,” said Kim Chu, director of USC Special Events Committee. “So we got on board with that immediately after The Newsroom [screening].”
A Facebook event drew more than 1900 people, but because only the orchestra and one balcony were made available, only 850 people would be allowed access into the screening, said Chu.
“The challenge [was] that there were too many people and that we [had] to turn down some people at the end. I mean, enthusiasm [for the event was] off the charts, within the first 30 minutes of me making the event public there were 850 people.”
Chu, a Game of Thrones fan herself, was thrilled to provide students an exciting event.
“I’m hoping to just enhance the USC experience for all of our students,” Chu said.
Many students began lining up Wednesday at noon for a guaranteed chance to attend the event.
“[I waited in line] for about six hours,” said Michael Malconian, a junior majoring in theatre. “I’m looking forward to see where all the plots happen and see the characters and spend time with some friends.”
Malconian also said he enjoyed the show due to its medieval fantasy setting and theme.
“I definitely like the mythos aspect of it, the lore, it’s very self-contained and I like that,” Malconian said.
Several students attended the event not only for the screening, but the overall experience of watching the show with other avid fans.
“The thing that appealed to me [about the event] was that I’m sitting in Bovard Auditorium with like 800 other people, and they’re all really hyped up about Game of Thrones,” said Benedict Chiu, a freshman majoring in business cinematic arts. “And it’s like we’re watching the preview and it’s just something I’m never going to get the chance of participating in again.”
The USC Special Events Committee will also be attempting to break the Guinness World Record for “Most Sandwiches Made in One Hour,” this Friday afternoon in partnership with Zeta Phi Rho to benefit their Zeta Phi “Skid” Rho philanthropy.
