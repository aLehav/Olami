Recruiting in any type of collegiate sports program has inherent difficulties, but having to overcome preconceived, negative notions and unfamiliarity with the sport makes the task much more demanding.
The USC women’s club rugby team faced this situation in its inaugural season during the spring semester of 2009.

As a newly established club, filling the minimum of 15 players needed to play in games proved to be a significant challenge.
“It was a real struggle. A lot of times we didn’t have subs and we were playing against teams with two times the players,” senior Shawna Kleban said.
In certain circumstances, the team was forced to use players from other colleges as fill-ins, which made creating team chemistry difficult.
“Having to borrow players made it hard to develop camaraderie,” USC coach Peter Tillotson said.
To promote a stronger connection within the team, the club is focusing on recruiting. But the lack of recognition of rugby, especially in Southern California, creates hardships in finding newcomers willing to try out the sport.
“It is difficult to recruit new girls, because many are not familiar with the sport,” Kleban said.
Given the adverse situation, the club has continued with an aggressive recruiting campaign in hopes of filling the dire need for players during the upcoming spring season.
Recruiting tactics have included manning a booth at the involvement fair, selling T-shirts, having team members bring friends to practice and giving talks at sorority house dinners to increase awareness and attract new members.
The Greek presence is beneficial to the team as its looks to increase its numbers.
“A decent amount of the team is Greek. We are trying to build on the sisterhood idea,” sophomore Kimberley Carder said.
As the number of team members and each one’s individual commitment increases, the club strives for continued growth and the ability to function on its own.
“Our goal is to make the club self-sufficient,” said junior Jessica Choi, president and founder of club.
To achieve this aspiration, the club plans to establish a rookie development program, headed by Carder.
“[The program] will peg a rookie with an experienced player,” Carder said. “This mentor program will help promote a better understanding of the sport.”
As part of this initiative, Carder looks to hold an additional practice composed of solely rookies to teach essential skills and rugby vernacular, and to build teamwork.
Successful implementation of this program would allow the club to build on some of the strong points that Tillotson has emphasized.
“The team’s biggest strengths are their enthusiasm and ability to pick up the game,” he explained.
The club’s roster currently lists 27 members, but it is always looking for more to try out.
“We would like to field at least two teams with 15 players each,” Tillotson said.
Currently the team has been participating in off-season training and the club has made evident strides over the course of the semester.
The team has played in several games to maintain playing shape, including the Scrum by the Sea Tournament in San Diego on Nov. 7 and 8, where it was able to win two matches.
Ultimately, Tillotson would like to see the club be on par with other rugby programs around the nation.
“[The aim] is to reach the level to compete with the more experienced clubs, and to play at the high level which [USC is] capable of playing,” he said.
The coaching staff has played a critical role in helping the team achieve some of its success in the off-season.
“Coach has been great in the development of the core of the team,” team captain Bonnie Wong said.
As the team develops, it looks to be competitive in the Collegiate Women’s Second Division of the Southern California Rugby Football Union.
Although the club continues to grow and achieves greater amounts of success, the team maintains a true sense of what sports are fundamentally about.
Junior Luisa Lam explained that the main purpose of the club is “learning about the game, not necessarily winning, but enjoying rugby and having fun.”
With this outlook, the club looks to continue and grow in number and in spirit by embracing the multifaceted sport of rugby and establishing long-lasting bonds between players.

After a dispiriting loss to Rutgers dropped the USC women’s basketball team to 1-3, the players came together and reached a decision.
Enough is enough.
They weren’t referencing the Donna Summers classic.  Rather, the team was tired of being on the wrong end of the final margin.
“We just didn’t want to keep losing,” junior Kari LaPlante said.  “After the Rutgers loss it sunk in and we decided [that was] not what we wanted.”
USC (3-3) turned it on after that, knocking off a pair of ranked opponents in its next two games to move to .500 on the season.  The Women of Troy get a chance to build on that momentum this week with road tests against Long Beach State and No. 11 Duke.
“Championships are won on the road,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.  “If you can’t win [on the road] it’s not going to be too good for you at home.”
Neither game will be an easy victory.  Former USC player and assistant coach Jody Wynn, in her first season at the helm for Long Beach State (3-3), will be gunning for a win in her return to Troy.
“I think that’ll give [them] more incentive to play extremely hard,” Cooper said.  “Usually when a coach leaves a program they always want to come back and do well.”
LaPlante said the returning players are eager to show their former coach how much they have improved.
“It’s going to be exciting because we’ve worked on our game a lot over the summer,” she said.  “We’re going to throw a couple of new things at her.”
Senior Karina Figueroa leads the 49ers in scoring with 18.2 points per game.
The Duke game gives USC a chance to exact revenge for last season’s loss at the Galen Center.  The Women of Troy were up by as many as 17 points in the second half before relinquishing the lead and the game.  Duke won in overtime, 97-89.
Slowing down junior Jasmine Thomas will be key for USC against Duke.  The lightning-quick guard leads her team in scoring and is coming off just the third triple-double in school history.
“Any player that we play in the country is going to have to go against all five of our players,” Cooper said.  “We’ll make it tough for her to score.”
The early-season schedule has been challenging by design.  Cooper said that playing tough non-conference games would help prepare the team for conference play.
“We’re still a work-in-progress,” he said.  “All of these games are a tune-up for when the Pac-10 conference starts, and that’s when we want to be ready.”
The Women of Troy play Long Beach State at 7 pm PT on Thursday and tip-off against Duke at 11 am PT on Saturday.
USC received a handful of votes in both the AP and Coaches Poll this week.

Now halfway through their term, Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher and Vice President Ashlie Chan still have many items left on their platform “to do” list, despite some accomplishments.
Elected on an ambitious platform, Slusher and Chan initially promised the expansion of gym and health center hours, improvements to meal plan options, increased communication with the student body and the establishment of a tram to local attractions. Though students now enjoy a free shuttle between campus and LA Live, many of the other promises remain unfulfilled.
Holding on · Holden Slusher, president of the Undergraduate Student Government, has made a point of increasing outreach. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“As long as we make progress … I know I’m doing my job,” Slusher said. “The nature of this position is you do have to give something over to the next person [in office] … We’ve done a lot for students, we’re going to do a lot, and I don’t want them to lose faith in us.”
In November, USG announced what Slusher and Chan said was their most notable achievement so far — the launch of a free tram to popular entertainment and dining venue LA Live.
“It just provides students a great way to enjoy entertainment in a very safe environment,” Chan said. “If anything had to get done, that’s something I definitely wanted to focus on.”
Many students said the tram is the most noticeable change USG has made to campus life so far, and they appreciated having a convenient option available for exploring the city.
“I’m glad they did the LA Live tram because it makes something that’s attractive to college students accessible,” said Alex Villafuerte, a junior majoring in history.
Improving USG’s visibility and reputation among the student body was also a major component of the Slusher-Chan campaign. With
weekly tabling on Trousdale Parkway, expansion of USG’s communications department and the launch of the first Council of Presidents — a joint forum for leaders of student organizations across campus — Slusher said he believes USG’s relationship with students has advanced significantly.
Despite that progress, Chan said USG still needs to work on increasing student knowledge of the organization’s purpose.
“Awareness of who we are has improved, [but awareness of] what we do still needs a lot of improvement,” she said.
But aside from revamped promotional efforts and the creation of a tram route to LA Live, much of the Slusher-Chan platform has yet to come to fruition.
During their campaign last spring, Slusher and Chan said they planned to work with officials at the Lyon Center and University Park Health Center to expand operation hours at both locations, hoping to keep the Lyon Center open 24 hours and to add weekend hours to UPHC.
But a lack of the financial resources needed to hire more staff and support extended operating hours prevented the implementation of the initiative this semester, Chan said. For now, USG will focus on improving Lyon Center amenities and publicizing the availability of vaccines at the UPHC.
“We’re pushing the hours thing [with the Lyon Center] but also the quality of the services they provide … We keep running into the budget problem,” Slusher said. “Ideally, the gym would be 24 hours, and the administration has understood that that’s beneficial.”
Although efforts to better align Lyon Center and UPHC services with students’ needs have not moved past the preliminary stages, other platform measures are slated to be finalized and possibly implemented during the spring semester, Slusher said.
Two such initiatives, Slusher said, are allowing dining dollars to roll over each semester and promoting safety at Leavey Library with the installation of turnstiles and the expansion of “student only” hours.
USG also plans to settle on changes to the student activity card system in time for the 2010 football season, Slusher said. With these changes, students who are not able to attend a home game will have the option of going to the USC Ticket Office, swiping their ID cards and receiving paper tickets to give to anyone they want.
But other aspects of their platform, such as convincing local businesses to accept USCard, will likely take longer to implement and may not be accomplished by the end of their tenure, Chan and Slusher said.
“A lot of projects are long-term. We are trying to carry out things that were happening years ago, but we’re also trying to roll with the punches and address issues that are happening now,” Chan said.
Many students said they understood the significant amount of time needed to make large institutional changes and that they valued the reforms USG has tried to make.
“I’m sure they do as much as they’re permitted to do by institutional constraints,” said Nicholas von Bergrosen-Bradvica, a freshman majoring in creative writing, political science and economics. “A lot of times they just can’t do it because the school’s not willing to implement their ideas, and there are budget cuts.”
But Hillary Levi, a junior majoring in cinema-television production, said the current economic climate should motivate USG to allocate its resources wisely and to take more steps to connect with every student on campus.
“Obviously with the economy, USG needs to re-evaluate what’s important and where their priorities lie,” she said. “They need to evaluate how involved they are with student organizations. I know it’s hard, but that’s their job.”
Slusher said over the coming weeks he and Chan will be re-examining their platform to determine what measures to focus on in the spring.
“There are a lot of things we’ve taken seriously that will come to fruition,” Slusher said. “Like past administrations, we do have our small successes, but hopefully we’ll have our big ones. I’d love to have our own successes and I think we will.”
Are we seriously surprised?
USG is a lobbying body.  The other ticket knew that, and promised appropriately.  But Senators are used to promising a lot and discovering they cannot deliver.
Less Obama, more failure!

Despite a semester-long push for students to take special precautions against the flu, USC health officials say not nearly enough students have been vaccinated — and they’re worried about student health heading into next semester.
Though cases of the flu have declined in recent weeks, officials warn the illness could resurface during and after winter break.
“No one knows what to expect after winter break, but that is the normal time for us to see the flu, so it could have another peak when students travel,” Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, wrote in an email.
According to Neinstein, cases of Influenza-like Illness jumped from 30 in the first week of school to 131 in the third week. Since then, however, cases have declined, and Neinstein said recently an average of 20-30 cases have been reported each week.
The health center does not specifically test for H1N1, but does occasionally determine if the flu is type A, B or C, which gives a glimpse into the frequency of H1N1 cases.
“We did do some rapid screening for type A early on to see if we were seeing H1N1, as most positive type A this season are H1N1,” Neinstein wrote.
Early in the year, Neinstein said, 40 percent of people tested for the flu were positive for type A. Now, however, that number has fallen below 10 percent.
But despite the recent lull, Neinstein said students should remain vigilant in guarding against the flu, and the best defense, he says, is vaccination.
“If prevention was really wanted, the students would come in and get the vaccine. That is the main and best modality of prevention,” Neinstein wrote.
Jeff Diamond, a spokesperson for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said winter break is the ideal time for students to be vaccinated if they haven’t been already.
“As more and more vaccines become available and it seems we are in a short decline in the number of cases being reported, [it is] the outstanding window of opportunity for college students to take the vaccine,” Diamond said. “Especially with the traveling over the holiday break, it’s a very good idea.”
But Neinstein said the majority of students seem uninterested in the vaccine.
“Most students do not want the vaccine,” Neinstein wrote. “About 10 percent or less of students have been vaccinated, that number should be way over 50 percent. I would like to see students banging down the doors for the vaccine without a crisis occurring on campus.”
Neinstein noted that students and young adults are among the groups hit hardest by H1N1, yet are also among the least likely to get vaccinated.
Amanda Smith, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, was among those who took advantage of the resources offered by the health center and got the H1N1 vaccine.
“I will go for any risk prevention. If one shot could save my life, why not?” Smith said.
But some students like Jac’Quez Page, a freshman majoring in psychology, said they are hesitant about getting a flu shot because some people have experienced negative side effects.
“It just doesn’t seem like a sure thing,” Page said.
Still, both Diamond and Neinstein emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated, because of the potential for abrupt changes in the flu’s patterns. Like Neinstein, Diamond said it was impossible to determine how flu cases will trend during and after winter break, even though reports are down at the moment.
“We have no earthly idea,” Diamond said. “The pandemic is totally unpredictable. We simply don’t know.”

Most of them are not law enforcement experts — and most don’t ever want to be. Some want to be rappers; others run their own businesses.
But after a year riddled with high-profile crimes, these yellow-jacketed observers were brought to campus to help create a safer atmosphere, and, according to campus safety officials, they have.
Patrolling · Despite being unarmed, students and officials say the CSC security officers have helped increase safety around campus. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
The security officers of the Contemporary Services Corporation were hired at the beginning of this semester to provide a visible security presence around campus. Wearing their distinctive yellow jackets, the officers monitor street corners on and near campus until 4 a.m. each day.
The CSC officers are unarmed, but Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said their presence alone discourages criminal activity.
“Criminals recognize them as security and most criminals want to avoid conflict when they commit crimes so they will go elsewhere,” Carlisle said.
Roy Sukimoto, CSC’s Los Angeles branch manager, agrees.
“The area around USC’s campus does offer a few more challenges regarding safety,” he said. “Having our people visible and proactive acts as a deterrent for crime.”
The officers are certainly visible in their brightly colored jackets. They are there, Sukimoto said, to serve as a resource for students, and also to report any crimes they might see.
“We don’t want to be watchdogs of the students, we want to be there to make their lives easier,” Sukimoto said. “We know students have enough to do without worrying about what’s around the corner, so we try to give peace of mind.”
Since the CSC officers came to campus, the number of reported crimes has actually gone up. But Carlisle said this is likely because more crimes are being observed, and does not necessarily mean more crimes are being committed.
“When you add 20 additional sets of eyes and ears whose duty it is to observe and report, you expect the number of reports to increase,” Carlisle said.
Even though most are not fully trained law enforcement officials, Sukimoto said the CSC officers’ ability to notice crimes in the making is often enhanced by their knowledge of the neighborhood. They report anything they see to DPS.
“They understand the type of people they’re looking for. They’re streetwise and they’re more seasoned than the average student or faculty member,” he said.
Sukimoto noted that several of the CSC officers stationed around campus come from nearby neighborhoods.
One of those officers, who is stationed near 32nd and Figueroa streets and declined to give her name because of company policies, said she isn’t worried about being unarmed because living in Compton has taught her what to look out for.
“I know about the area. It looks and seems bad but it’s not like people are walking up and pulling guns out everyday,” she said. “I’ve seen worse, so I’m not scared.”
The officer said that in her time at USC she’s called in several bike thefts and is constantly watching for suspicious activity. When things are quiet, however, she finds ways to keep busy.
“I’m always thinking about my master plan and the homeless guys keep me company during a lot of the day,” she said.
Some students said the CSC officers made them feel safer, but they questioned their ability to stop crime.
“I feel safer having them around, but I would like them to have some sort of weapon in case they need it,” said Ana-Claudia Magana, a junior majoring in creative writing and psychology.
Others said just the presence of the CSC officers was enough to add to the area’s security. Michelle Black, a junior majoring in violin performance, said the CSC officers offer an appropriate balance of security and privacy.
“They’re friendly and make me feel safe when I’m walking home at night,” Black said.
Some students also said they hope the CSC presence will increase.
“It has made an impact on 28th Street and the Row, but I do not feel safe because I live on the 26th [Street],” said LC Lim, a senior majoring in psychology and communication. “There should be at least two or three officers on the west side [of campus].”
Sukimoto said that while there are currently no plans to expand CSC’s range to the west side of campus, it is something they might look into for the future.
“Being in our first year of operation, DPS wanted to see that what we’re doing works,” Sukimoto said.
Currently, resources are allocated to parts of campus where the majority of students are located, Carlisle said, but there is potential for expansion.
“There’s no end date on using their services, so it’ll continue for the foreseeable future,” he said.
I love the use of the CSC service.  I do not believe they need to be armed, as they can call in crimes and armed criminals to DPS, who can get anywhere pretty quickly in SUVs or their T3Motion chariots.
It’s unfortunate that just about anyone who wants can own a gun in the United States.  It makes it practically necessary for law enforcement to carry guns.

The committee charged with finding a replacement for President Steven B. Sample, who announced his retirement last month, has begun the process of searching for applicants and seeking input from the USC community, but some are concerned about the level of student involvement.
“We’re going to come up with the best president we can get for USC,” said Ed Roski, Jr., the chairman of both the Board of Trustees and the Presidential Search Advisory Committee. “We’ve had a tremendous success with President Sample and we want to continue that success going forward.”
Wine to water · The men’s club crew team christened their new shell, the Steven B. Sample, in front of Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday. The team decided to dedicate the shell to the outgoing president in honor of his 19 years of leadership at USC. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Six other trustees and six faculty members from both of USC’s campuses sit on the advisory committee, which Roski formed based on the advice of chairmen from the Board of Trustees at other major universities that have recently selected a new president. The faculty members come from a variety of different fields.
“We wanted to have a representative group of the faculty on the selection committee,” Roski said. “The faculty on the committee have been at USC, they understand USC … and they have the respect of the students and the respect of other faculty members.”
Conspicuously missing from the search committee, however, are students.
Though the committee met with the Undergraduate Student Government Executive Committee and the Graduate and Professional Student Senate on Nov. 17 and 18, USG President Holden Slusher said he does not feel students are involved or represented enough in the search.
“[The meetings are] the full extent of student interaction in this process and we just think that’s unacceptable,” Slusher said. “It’s rude that the head trustee of our university would say that we can’t trust students in the same way that we can trust faculty and other trustees.”
At one of the meetings, students from the USG executive board discussed what they want in the next president, telling the trustees they want Sample’s successor to continue his engagement with teaching and establish a strong personal vision, community service interests and well-rounded endeavors, Slusher said.
Slusher is now working with the USC Graduate Senate to encourage the committee to accept at least one undergraduate and one graduate student to serve as representatives or guest members on the committee, to ensure that student interests are not “undermined.”
“It’s my job as the president of the undergraduate student body to make sure that the needs of the undergraduate students are at all times met,” Slusher said. “This is one point in our history when we can affect not just the lives of the current students, but all future students.”
Slusher said he would recommend the top candidates speak to campus organizations and take questions from students.
“Although I trust the process and know that we’ll get a great president, I do think that we need more student input and that’s why we’re fighting for this,” he said.
USG passed a resolution Tuesday requesting more student involvement in the search process and representation on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee.
“It’s not exactly prudent for students to be involved in the process as they search through over 600 potential candidates, but when we get down to a couple choices I think students need to be involved in that process,” Slusher said.
But Roski said the committee is making every effort to include student viewpoints.
The committee has not yet determined the criteria by which to judge candidates, Roski said, but it has held “student to student” discussions to gain an understanding of the qualities students would like to see in their next president.
“We are involving the students,” Roski said. “It’s important for us to listen to the students, see their views at the university.”
To lead the search process, the committee has hired William Funk, head of a higher education search consultant firm, Roski said.
Under Funk’s guidance, the advisory committee has published advertisements in publications like the New York Times and the Chronicle of Higher Education. The committee has already received a number of letters of interest, Roski added.
The members plan to start reviewing prospects in mid-January, before narrowing down the contenders and conducting interviews. Though Sample gave the trustees nine months until he steps down in August, the trustees plan to name his successor by June 1, 2010.
Zooey, I suggest researching what tremendous things Provost Nikias has done for the university during his tenure as Provost and looking into his incredible achievements as Dean of the Engineering School. After reading the facts, I recommend re-writing your post.
Agree with “Alumni” above, I’m guessing the reason that students aren’t represented in this process is because students know next-to-nothing about running a successful university
I’d like to add my 2 cents. Back in the days, the early 1990’s and prior, USC was known as a party-school. The Trojans of today don’t know this, at least most of them.It was the days, that when we squashed UCLA at football, they’d retort back by labeling us the “dumb rich-kids’ school” whose only forte was football but not academics. The Bruins were right, USC dwelled on being a NFL expedient while foregoing its academic department. We were an organization that bought our privileges in life, not earn them. USC lost sight of the most important experience in higher education–academics!!!!!
UCLA rightfully so, had every right to demean us that way. The past administrators and presidents didn’t care that we were academically inferior to them, or any academically prestigious university for that matter. They were smug.
President Sample changed all that. And because today’s Trojans don’t know where we came from they shouldn’t be in the represented in the decision process.
Now that our football program is at a low, let’s put a bigger portion of the  budget into the academics rather football. It’s time to let go of football, and pass the torch to other schools.
…Emerald Bowl, yay!!!!!
I for one think Nikias would be a great hire.  He has shown great vision at creating the widely popular Visions & Voices program and is quite friendly with students.  Current students, however, should not have a vote in deciding who the next president is.  They do not have the viewpoint necessary to see what is best for the university system as a whole, since their experiences are largely confined to their social niches and individual schools.
I was reading my strategic management (BUAD 497) book today, yeah I’m crammed for a quiz, and it is proven time and time again, that hiring within an organization rather than outsiders, perpetuates the success of that organization.
Zooey,
Can you elaborate on why that would be such a mistake? I don’t know anything about Provost Nikias, but I’d be interested to hear some background on this…
oooohhhh Zooey owns a thesuraus
Notwithstanding the gratuitous nature of Trustee Roski’s comments RE: inclusion of undergraduate students in the search process; the University can, at this point, command the attention of virtually any and all scholars and administrators in the US and around the world as candidates for the daunting task of being our next President. It is common knowledge among alumni that Provost Nikias has already begun his overtly strident and not-so-subtle campaign to assume that position. One can only hope that Mr. Roski and the other trustees understand that such a hiring would be a mistake of cataclysmic proportions.
No beer at the Coliseum yet this guy pours Champagne like it is going out of style….

As part of the Big 12/Pac-10 Hardwood Series, the USC men’s basketball team will travel to the University of Texas’ Erwin Center tomorrow to play the No. 2 Longhorns for the first time since their matchup in the second round of the 2007 NCAA Tournament.
More than two seasons ago, the Trojans dashed the hopes of a young Longhorn team that featured National Player of the Year Kevin Durant by knocking off Texas 87-68 behind junior guard Nick Young’s 22 points and seven rebounds, which sent the Trojans to the Sweet 16.
Road trip · Guard Donte Smith gets his first road start Friday. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
Now, more than 30 months later, the Longhorns (5-0) will welcome a much different Trojans squad (2-2) to the Erwin Center, where the Longhorns haven’t lost a game since February.
The Trojans are coming off their first matchup as a part of the now three-year-old Big 12/Pac-10 series in which they were unable to secure a victory against Nebraska after Cornhusker freshman Eshaunte Jones hit a game-winning corner for three points with 11.7 seconds left to give Nebraska a 51-48 victory.
USC’s 17 turnovers and 11 missed free throws contributed to a Trojan offensive attack, whose missed opportunities equally contributed to the loss against Nebraska.
“If we knock the free throws down, or commit less turnovers, we would probably win by 10,” redshirt junior point guard Donte Smith said.
Redshirt junior forward Alex Stephenson, who made his season debut during the Trojan’s 74-43 win against Coppin State over the weekend, was a bright spot for the Trojans against the Cornhuskers. Stephenson contributed 13 points and three blocks and will be integral in the game plan against a physical Longhorn team.
A senior tandem of senior center Dexter Pittman and senior guard Damion James have combined for more than 30 points per game in the Longhorn’s first five games of the season, and will be key matchups for the inexperienced Trojan team.
Also weighing on the mind of USC coach Kevin O’Neill is his team’s lack of starting experience on the road.
“We have a bunch of guys who have never started a game on the road, let alone play as far away as Texas,” O’Neill said. “But hopefully, by Pac-10 time, this trip will grow us up a little bit.”

The USC’s women’s volleyball team will host the first two rounds of the NCAA Women’s Volleyball Tournament at the Galen Center this weekend.
The first round of the tournament begins at 5 p.m. with No. 12 Hawai’i and New Mexico, followed by USC and Oklahoma at 7 p.m. The winners of each match will play against each other on Saturday in a 7 p.m. game.
Setting up · Senior co-captain Jessica Gysin leads the Women of Troy into the NCAA tournament, where they will open with Oklahoma. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy are coming into this year’s NCAA tournament with a winning history, in which the school has won six national championships (1976, 1977, 1980, 1981, 2002 and 2003) and has achieved a record of  58-22 (.725) in NCAA postseason play. The Women of Troy have also reached the Final Four in five of their last nine seasons.
Their first battle against Oklahoma will set the tone for the rest of the tournament. Oklahoma has an 18-11 record on the season, finishing tied for fourth place in the Big 12 Conference. The Sooners recorded a 13.16 kills per set average, hit .208 with 17.6 digs per set and 2.18 blocks per set average in the season.
USC is 2-0 all-time against Oklahoma. The team’s last meeting took place in 2008 at the Trojan Invitational at the Galen Center, when the Women of Troy won 3-1. This is the first time USC and Oklahoma have faced each other in postseason play.
If USC ends up sweeping the Sooners out of the competition on Friday, the Women of Troy will be playing either Hawaii or New Mexico in the next round of postseason play.
Hawaii is 28-2 after the season, and won the Western Athletic Conference regular season championship with a perfect 16-0 record. Hawaii ended its season with 14.53 kills per set, hitting .324 with a 13.26 digs per set and 2.46 blocks per set.
Hawaii leads the all-time series with the Women of Troy by 20-16 and have won the last three meetings against USC.
USC is 3-4 all-time in the postseason against Hawaii, however, although the Rainbow Wahine swept the Women of Troy last year in the second round at the Galen Center and won a five-set match in the 2006 regional semifinal in Honolulu.
New Mexico is 20-9 after the season and ended up tied for third place in the Mountain West Conference at 10-6. The Lobos have recorded 12.79 kills per set while hitting .224, and 13.59 digs per set with a 2.43 blocks per set average.
USC leads the all-time series with New Mexico 3-1. In their last meeting in 1994, it was the only time that both teams had ever faced each other in any postseason play. USC ended up sweeping New Mexico in the second round of NCAA play.

I was talking to a USC alum recently and was expressing my disappointment at the football team this year.
There’s no way USC can win a national championship. No way the team can win the Pac-10 title. And no way the Trojans can compete in a BCS bowl.
It wasn’t exactly the type of season I wanted the football team to have my senior year. After all, fans and students assume near perfection at this point when it comes to coach Pete Carroll and crew.
The expectations for the football season are basically as follows:
No losses would be a great, but expected, season. One loss would be fine as long as it was early enough in the season for the Trojans to work their way back into title contention. Two losses would be shameful, but still somewhat acceptable as long as the team would win the Pac-10 and compete in the Rose Bowl.
Three losses or more would be simply unacceptable. And that’s where the team stands now with one game left to play in its schedule.
I was ranting on a little bit to the alum, and at one point I said the recent blowout losses to Oregon and Stanford were absolutely embarrassing to be a part of during my tenure at the school.
That’s when he stopped me.
He told me it wasn’t too long ago that USC would die for a three-loss season (you know, the one we dread as fans nowadays).
He referenced me back to the forgettable USC football teams of the 1990s, when he attended the university. He explained that many of those teams were tough to watch for fans and students everywhere.
During the decade, the Coliseum was rarely full for games. The team never was a real threat in competing for a national championship or a Pac-10 title. And throughout the ‘90s, USC suffered an unimaginable eight consecutive losses to the Bruins from ’91 to ’98.
Could you even imagine that happening today?
The tough times for USC football extended all the way through 2001, until Carroll finally turned the program around and instilled the type of hard-nosed players and winning attitude we’ve come to know and love today.
This reference back to the ‘90s, however, got me to thinking, and I dug deeper into the numbers to see how those teams stacked up to the current USC squad.
If you look at the win-loss records from 1990 through 2001, USC racked up only 74 wins against 57 losses. That’s a winning percentage of .564.
Since that time, USC has had a remarkable record of 78-11 for a winning percentage of .876. Not to mention, the program has wrapped up two national championships and seven consecutive Pac-10 titles.
So yeah, maybe USC won’t compete for a national championship or Pac-10 title this year, but is it something to be embarrassed about?
After looking over the numbers, the answer is no.
A “disappointing” three-loss season is actually a testament to how strong the program is right now. No other team has compiled as many wins as USC since 2002, and no other team may go through another stretch like USC has had again.
So although the game on Saturday doesn’t have any national title implications — that game will be between Florida and Alabama — and it doesn’t have any Pac-10 title implications — that would be the Oregon State vs. Oregon game tonight — it is nothing for USC fans to get upset about.
A 9-3 record may not be what we expected, but it shouldn’t be considered an embarrassing season if it ends up that way. If the Trojans win Saturday and win their bowl game (wherever that may be), it can once again walk away with a double-digit win season.
Last time I checked, that wasn’t so bad.
But I think there is one question lingering in the minds’ of Trojans fans everywhere.
Is this season the beginning of the end for USC’s dominance in the college football landscape or is it simply a blip on the radar?
It’s true that the Pac-10 may be stronger conference now than it has been in years past. And it’s true that the quarterbacking in the conference may be the best ever during the Pete Carroll ever. It’s also true that USC may have lost some of its swagger this season.
But, it also can’t be forgotten that USC lost eight starters on defense from last season, had an extremely tough road schedule (traveling to Ohio State, Oregon, Cal and Notre Dame), played six of its first nine games away from the Coliseum, had a true freshman at quarterback and lost some serious playmakers, including Taylor Mays, Matt Barkley, Stafon Johnson and Damian Williams, for extended periods of time.
That is an awful lot to handle for one team, even if it is super talented.
I don’t think this year marks the downfall of the Trojans. My vote goes for blip on the radar.
Despite the tough season, at least one thing can keep Trojans’ fans happy. It certainly doesn’t seem like the teams of the ‘90s will be back any time soon.

We have been on a slow but steady decline since ’05.  How anyone can’t recognize that is beyond me.
We lost our GREAT assistant coaches and replaced them with serviceable ones.  No reason why we should no have outscored Texas.  Our genius OC’s Sark and Kiff scored a grand total of 10…10!!!! pnts in the first half with the greatest collection of talent on the offensive side of the ball.
With Norm Chow – 2 Titles
Wihtout – 0 Titles
Unless Pete hires some experienced COLLEGE coaches, not some NFL guys to mold and coach up our guys, I don’t expect us to be competing at the top anymore.  Pete was smart enough to bring in smart, experienced guys when he first started, not anymore.
Charlie Wiess would give anything for just three losses

For USC’s senior class, Saturday will be its last hurrah at the Coliseum. Although the season may not have gone as planned for the 19 players suiting up for the final time at home, establishing bowl bids and the Pac-10 pecking order will still be at stake when No. 20 USC (8-3, 5-3) takes on Arizona (7-4, 5-3) Saturday at 12:30 p.m.
Saying goodbye · Sixth-year defensive back Josh Pinkard will be among the 19 seniors that will suit up at the Coliseum for the final time on Saturday against Arizona. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
A bid to the Holiday Bowl could be on the line for both the Wildcats and the Trojans, pending the result of Thursday night’s game between Oregon and Oregon State. Both USC and Arizona could finish the season either tied for second in the Pac-10 or tumble down to sixth place.
“We’re kind of feeling good about getting back on track after the two weeks prior,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “We are looking forward to this last go round.”
Safety Taylor Mays is among the seniors who will be playing for the final time in the Coliseum. Cornerback Josh Pinkard and offensive guard Jeff Byers will also be making their final starts after six years with USC.
“It’s a great group of kids and we hate seeing them go,” Carroll said. “We’d love to send them off on a great note.”
Despite securing two late touchdown drives against UCLA, including a controversial decision to throw a touchdown to redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams in the final minute, Carroll is still looking for more out of his offense. He said he was especially concerned with the team’s performance on third downs, where penalties and plays for negative yards kept the Trojans behind the chains.
USC converted four of 12 third-down attempts last week and ranks 100th out of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams in third-down efficiency.
“It continues to be an issue,” Carroll said. “Because of the long yardage situations, we gave up on some of them just to kick the football back. We have to improve there.”
With junior running back Joe McKnight sitting out practice Wednesday, redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford could see an increased workload following a two-touchdown performance against UCLA. Bradford carried the ball 14 times against the Bruins and helped USC control the ball and keep the clock running late in the game.
“We love him being part of the offense,” Carroll said. “So it wouldn’t be any problem for me at all to run him 25 times if that was the case in the game.”
The Wildcats have experienced a rocky season in which six of their games have been decided by eight points or less. Last week, Arizona needed a last-second field goal to defeat rival Arizona State.
But for all the progress that Arizona has made this season, USC remains one of the few great tests. The Wildcats have not beaten the Trojans in the last seven years, despite holding the contest close in each of the last two years.
Arizona coach Mike Stoops said Saturday’s game would be a good measuring stick for how far the program has come.
“Competing against USC, I think tells you a lot about where you’re at,” Stoops said. “I think you learn more and more about your team as you go through it. Certainly we’ll see how we match up with USC Saturday.”
The Wildcats are still sorting our a series of injuries to several key players on their explosive offense. Junior running back Nic Grigsby is not expected to play Saturday because of a shoulder injury. Sophomore quarterback Nick Foles has a broken non-throwing hand but will still try to play against the Trojans. Backup sophomore quarterback Matt Scott is expected to see time on a handful of plays as a change-of-pace player.
But even with the injuries, Carroll noted that the Wildcats’ attack was dangerous because of its versatility.
“We have a big preparation in store here to get ready for this thing,” Carroll said. “They’ve scored a lot of points this year and done a lot of good stuff with their offense.”

The ball rotates peculiarly — a product of the barrage of back-and-forth hits it’s endured. Both players transfix their eyes on the object in motion, calculating where the ball is going and what they are going to do with it next. Finally, with one sweeping blow, the ball is sent back over the net, clipping a corner of the table before it shoots off into the distance.
Ph.D. student Amitabha Ghosh and sophomore Akhilesh Kajaria stand across from each other grinning, consumed only momentarily by their thoughts on the previous point’s result. A warm acknowledgement of the shot is given, the score is announced and play resumes as if it had never stopped.

On this night — just like any other practice evening — the two battle for every point in the match, focusing constantly on improving both their skills and techniques that will be needed come tournament time. While their focus is unwavering, they enjoy every minute of it.
Ghosh and Kajaria are standing on the gym floor on the north end of USC’s PED building. The two competitors are ping pong players — members of the Ping Pong Posse, a table tennis club at USC that, despite its youth, has found continued success since its humble beginnings.
Evolution of a team
In 2002, then-USC students Adam Bobrow and Angad Singh formed a small ping pong club consisting of 10 members — the Ping Pong Posse. The club only had one table to practice on, which, in addition to all its other equipment, was paid for primarily by the club members themselves.
Despite the club’s lack of equipment, it eventually grew and improved. The Ping Pong Posse started a competitive team, T-Cubed, which, behind Bobrow’s leadership, placed well in the tournaments it entered. With success came a steady increase in both numbers and national recognition.
Then, in 2004, the team caught a break. The Ping Pong Posse caught the eye of table tennis company Killerspin, who was impressed enough with the team’s play and dynamic image to offer the club a sponsorship — making the Ping Pong Posse the only collegiate club in the nation to receive a corporate sponsorship.
Now able to practice with proper equipment, T-Cubed made the national tournament three years in a row from 2005-2007, including a third-place finish in 2005.
With the backing of Killerspin and the efforts of its members, the Ping Pong Posse has now grown to more than 50 active players, and more annual sign-ups than any club at USC.
According to junior Charles Hu, president of the Ping Pong Posse, none of this was possible without Bobrow’s efforts and enthusiasm.
“[Bobrow] is, without a doubt, the most passionate person about ping pong you will ever meet,” Hu said. “He treats [the club] like a job, and he gets on my ass when I’m lazy. He really made the club as big as it is today.”
Bobrow, who graduated from USC in 2003 with a degree in theatre, has since found success in the entertainment industry, taking a role in the movie Ping Pong Playa as well as providing several video game voiceovers. He even starred in the YouTube sensation “Excessive Ping Pong Celebration,” created by the Ping Pong Posse, which has more than 10 million views.
Hitting their stride
This season, T-Cubed has four varsity players on its roster: Ghosh and Kajaria, graduate student Subal Mehta and senior Mikhail Kazantsev.
Kazantsev is a former member of the US men’s national team and champion at both the under-22 and under-18 levels. Mehta is a former India men’s national team member and 20-time champion of his region.
As determined by the National Collegiate Table Tennis Association, which scores players on a scale from 0 (novice) to more than 3,000 (world-class competitor), the two have rankings of 2,365 and 2,199, respectively. These rankings place them among the nation’s collegiate elite.
The experience of the varsity team has translated into success for T-Cubed. The group recently swept the first leg of the Southern California regionals, defeating UCSD 4-0 and UCLA 3-1 to take first place. The second leg, held this spring, will determine which team from Southern California advances to the national tournament in Wisconsin in April.
Additionally, T-Cubed hopes to send some of its members to the Associations of College Unions International tournament, where they can compete on an individual level.
“I really hope to play in the national tournament next year,” Ghosh said. “I hope, as the Ping Pong Posse, we can really put our name out there.”
Relishing the experience
Despite the dominance of the varsity team, the club’s members maintain that the focus of the Ping Pong Posse is on all its members.
A large part of that experience is beyond simply playing ping pong, as members of the club recently stepped in as extras for the movies Balls of Fury and Ping Pong Playa, and even squared off against Jason Alexander and Lauren Conrad at celebrity tournaments.
“I really want people to know that Ping Pong Posse isn’t just a regular ping pong club,” Hu said. “We do so much other stuff.”
Another draw of the Ping Pong Posse is its diversity and range of talent. Regular members consist of undergraduate and graduate students of all rankings, international students, Ph.D. students, professors and even celebrities — Adoni Maropis, an actor on the show 24, practices with the Posse every Wednesday.
“We have a really diverse [group],” Hu added. “It really sets us apart.”
And considering all that it has accomplished in seven short years, you can rest assured that this is one posse that won’t cease to entertain.

They say the most difficult task in collegiate sports is to repeat as champions.
Starting this Saturday, the USC men’s water polo team will attempt to go about doing just that, hoping to repeat their 2008 run through the NCAA Water Polo Championship and capture a second straight title.
Despite losing in the semifinals of the MPSF tournament and finishing a surprising third in the event held at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, the Trojans (24-2, 8-0) were selected as the NCAA’s only at-large bid, and received the No. 1 overall ranking in the four team championship.
The Trojans will open with the fourth-seed Princeton Tigers (15-11), the champions of the Collegiate Water Polo Association who the Trojans defeated handily at McDonald’s 14-3 in early October.
“We trained hard, we just stuck to our plan when we got in the pool, and took care of it,” senior driver Anthony Artukovich said of the Trojan’s big win over the Tigers.
This time, however, the national semifinal will be held at Princeton’s own DeNunzio Pool, which has a reputation as one of the nation’s best home pool advantage.
Playing in front of their home crowd, the Tigers feature two All-CWPA scorers on offense, senior attackers Mark Zalewski and Douglas Wigley.
The Tiger defense is headed by junior goalie Mike Merlone, whose performance during the Eastern Championship helped the Tigers make their way to the NCAA tournament.
In the other NCAA semifinal, a Southern California matchup between MPSF tournament champs UCLA and Western Water Polo Association champion Loyola Marymount will battle for a spot in the finals.
The Trojans have had crossed paths with both teams multiple times this season, and are well prepared if they can make it past the tournament hosts on Saturday.
Against LMU this season, the Trojans have hit on all cylinders, holding the Lions to six goals or less in both swims against the team. The Trojans scored 11 goals in both matchups against the Lions, one in the season-opening Triton Invitational and another in an inter-conference matchup at McDonald’s earlier this season.
The team’s matchups with UCLA this season have been more competitive.
Most recently, the Trojans lost to the Bruins at home, ending a nearly five-season long home winning streak, in the MPSF semifinals 10-6.
In the teams’ three matchups during the regular season, the Trojans and Bruins had seen the outcome of the game not decided until the final moments of each game.
In the semifinals of both the SoCal and NorCal tournaments, the Bruins and Trojans traded off one-goal victories.
In their lone conference matchup of the season, the teams met on a Saturday night at UCLA’s Speiker Aquatics Center, and a last minute shot from redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling sent the Trojans to a one-goal victory.
“UCLA’s always pumped up to play us, and we’re always pumped to play them,” Artukovich said. “We know each others game plan, which makes the games close, but sometimes it just falls apart for us.”
If the Trojans are successful in repeating it will cap the careers of a large group of talented seniors, which Artukovich sees as a perfect ending to his career.
“Winning would mean the world to us,” Artukovich said. “We need some closure to the great time we’ve had here. We’re a family now and we want to go out with a bang.”

With spring semester quickly approaching, the number of students moving out of USC Housing is expected to be lower than usual, but more freshmen and transfer spring admits who applied for university owned housing will be accepted than in previous years.
As of Wednesday, 281 students have canceled their contracts with USC Housing for three main reasons: studying abroad, graduating early or moving into their fraternity or sorority houses, wrote Keenan Cheung, director of USC Housing, in an email.
“That number will go up because people will decide not to come back to school during break … within 10 to 15 percent,” he said.
This is because fewer students opted to live in USC-owned housing this year than in past years, leaving beds vacant during the course of this semester in addition to those that are opening up at the close of the semester.
“We had roughly 300 freshmen apply for housing and we had 140-ish transfers apply for housing,” Cheung said. “So based on the move-out rate, we were able to offer all freshmen housing and we were able to offer a majority of the transfers housing.”
Cheung said he does not know why fewer students applied for housing this academic year, but said USC Housing is offering the same amount of spots as usual.
Students can cancel their housing contracts at any point during the year, but to do so, students or USC Housing must find other interested students to take over their contract and be willing to lose their $400 deposit. Otherwise, a student will not be able to cancel his or her contract.
“Students can cancel in the middle of the semester,” Cheung said. “It is however more difficult to find replacements at this time because most students already have housing arrangements.”
Likewise, students can also break their contracts if they meet either of two requirements: if the student is not registered for classes spring semester because he or she is graduating or taking a leave of absence, or if the student agrees to pay USC Housing a $250 cancellation fee to help them find a replacement.
Students who are studying abroad in the spring and or graduating in December are not penalized by USC Housing and do not lose their confirmation fee when they cancel their contracts, Cheung said.
“You go to the Office of Overseas Studies and they sign a housing release form that confirms we’re going on a USC-sponsored program,” said Mark Pises, a sophomore majoring in political science who is traveling to Madrid in the spring. “Then we take that form to the housing office … and we will be released at the end of the [fall] semester.”
The Office of Overseas Studies assists students who live off campus in subletting their rooms or apartments before they go abroad.
“We have a message board on our website where [students] can post housing,” said Veronica Gomez, the overseas studies program assistant. “Students going abroad put down their available housing. Students who come back from going abroad check the message board upon returning to USC.”
Other students, however, break their contracts with USC Housing for other reasons.
Brianne Ryan, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, said she moved out of Birnkrant Residential College dormitory and into the Sigma Delta Tau sorority house last year after the fall semester, because she was elected to the sorority’s executive board.
“It was very easy,” she said. “[USC Housing] had me fill out a form and they told me they’d let me know if someone would take my room, and within 48 hours they called and someone wanted my room, so it was done.”
But the process isn’t smooth for everyone.
“I filed a cancellation request,” said Samantha Meyer, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies who wants to move into her sorority house this spring. “They told me that it would be highly unlikely that they would find someone to take over my contract this semester because there hasn’t been a high demand for any USC housing.”
The cancellation requests that USC Housing approved will now be assigned to freshmen coming to USC in the spring, who are first of the spring admits to receive a housing assignment, Cheung said.
“If there is space left after all spring freshmen are assigned, then spring transfers are offered housing assignments,” he said.

Wikipedia states that to be considered an independent film, half the film’s budget must come from a source besides a major studio.  But to hipsters everywhere, “indie” can either be annoying and pretentious or nihilistic and edgy.  In any case, so-called indie film has come a long way in the last 10 years. This list details 10 of the most “indie” independent films to have been released based on three criteria:
Profit: How much money the movie made in the box office compared to its budget. Not the highest goal on the shelf for many independent filmmakers, so profit has the least amount weight.
Critical Acclaim: How well the film was received by critics.  Important if the film has aspirations for infiltrating the mainstream circuit.
Indie Cred: Underappreciated.  Influential.  Courageous.  Bold. There’s no single term to describe “indie cred,” so the opinion is really left up to one’s own opinion.
10.  Paranormal Activity (2009): After grossing over $100 million dollars on a budget of just $15,000, Paranormal Activity holds the record as the most profitable independent film of all time. Though some argue the production design and acting were highly amateur, director Oren Peli managed to use the hyper-realism to his advantage by tricking audiences into thinking the film was “found” footage.  The film was generally well-received by critics, but lost a chunk of indie cred when fans discovered the ending was changed by Steven Spielberg.
Profit:  10
Critical Acclaim:  6
Indie Cred:  4
9.  Juno (2007):  Another highly profitable independent film, Juno will forever remain in America’s minds as the stripper-penned high school dark comedy about the 16-year-old pregnant girl whose favorite alcoholic beverages are Boone’s Snow Peak Peach and Marker’s Mark. Using offbeat humor, pop culture references and a sweet message, the film swallowed up the box office and stole the hearts of viewers across the world.  Unfortunately for indie film nerds, Juno was so successful that it helped transition the outsider lifestyle to the mainstream and caused rebellious hipsters everywhere to roll their eyes and refine their senses of irony.
Profit:  9
Critical Acclaim:  9
Indie Cred:  2
8. Palindromes (2004): Possibly the greatest cult filmmaker since John Waters (1988’s Hairspray), Todd Solondz wrote and directed this dramedy about a pregnant 13-year-old who takes a cross-country journey to find herself. The film’s highly controversial premise and execution (the lead character is played by eight different actors of dissimilar races, genders, and ages) generated low box office numbers and mixed reviews. But Palindromes’ masterful combination of nihilism and satire earned a small but extremely loyal following of fans.  That Solondz funded the film with his entire life savings when no major studios would support him only adds to the evidence that he is the ultimate indie badass.
Profit:  3
Critical Acclaim:  4
Indie Cred:  10
7.  The Descent (2005): In a time of cheesy, predictable and quietly misogynist slasher films following in the wake of the Scream franchise, the UK unleashed one of the most terrifying horror films in years.  The Descent is about a group of ladies who take a spelunking vacation into the depths of a dark, creepy cave and get stuck at the very bottom with flesh-eating monsters. The film’s success led to an equally sensational US release, but with a different studio-influenced ending leaving fans to look up the original one on YouTube.
Profit:  8
Critical Acclaim:  8
Indie Cred:  6
6.  Memento (2000): Before he became one of the most profitable studio directors of all time with The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan debuted this thriller about a man with a rare form of amnesia  in which his brain can no longer store memories. Memento gained attention at film festivals around the world and eventually crossed over into the mainstream with both critical and financial success. The groundbreaking story structure and plot reinvented the psychological thriller and jumpstarted Nolan’s mainstream career.
Profit:  7
Critical Acclaim:  9
Indie Cred:  6
5. Lost in Translation (2002): With its moody tone and  a distortion-heavy soundtrack, Lost in Translation is the definitive tale of two singular generations intersecting through shared confusion and desperation. The film is the cinematic equivalent of meditation, and by the end viewers are filled with a sense of hope and anticipation.  Unfortunately, many indie wing nuts embraced these themes in the far inferior Garden State, and Lost in Translation became commonly mistaken as a conventional Oscar-baiting film.
Profit:  8
Critical Acclaim:  9
Indie Cred:  7
4.  Little Miss Sunshine (2006): As the film that helped redefine the word “indie,” Little Miss Sunshine possessed a brilliant ensemble cast, great direction and a screenplay that was so funny and uplifting that many of the film’s stereotypical indie themes suddenly became acceptable to the mainstream and eventually the Oscars. Its success was responsible for stabilizing the token “indie slot” in the Best Picture race, which paved the way for films like Juno and Slumdog Millionaire.
Profit:  8
Critical Acclaim:  8
Indie Cred:  8
3. Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001): Not since the Rocky Horror Picture Show has a movie musical with deliberate gender themes been so widely appreciated as Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Directed by John Cameron Mitchell, Hedwig was a critical knockout thanks to strong performances, colorful cinematography, musical numbers and universal themes of finding one’s “other half.” Thanks to its friendly emotional poignancy and depth, Hedwig managed to avoid preaching to the choir while simultaneously staying truthful to itself.  The film went on to win numerous festival awards and already has a large enough cult following to make Tim Curry shake in his stilettos.
Profit:  3
Critical Acclaim:  8
Indie Cred:  9
2. Requiem for a Dream (2001): Quite possibly the most critically overlooked film of the decade, Requiem for a Dream’s edgy cinematic style, crazed acting, and haunting soundtrack was only director Darren Aronofsky’s second film.  The plot may sound like an Oscar-baiting cliché — four people succumb to their drug addictions — but the tone and atmosphere conveyed by Aronofsky is what blew naïve viewers away. Ask anybody who has witnessed the film, and he or she will probably look at you like they just awoke from a crazy trip they wish they hadn’t been a part of, but are glad they experienced in the end.
Profit:  4
Critical Acclaim:  9
Indie Cred:  9
1.  Ghost World (2001): At the turn of the century, a quiet little film hit theaters in limited release but delivered a frighteningly dark message about where society currently stands and where it is headed in the future.
In Ghost World, we are introduced to Enid and Rebecca, the two odd, sarcastic friends everybody knew in high school, but completely forgot about afterward.  They take audiences on a tour of their favorite places to hate — strip malls, mega-plexes, bohemian coffee shops and fake ’50s diners — without ever quite discovering a place to love.
When Rebecca begins to mature and find an apartment, Enid starts to resign to a life of codependency, self-loathing and fear of growing up in quickly declining Western civilization.
Much like the independent film industry as a whole, Enid is not a character a lot of people like or understand — and that is why the ending of the film is so tragic.  Enid aggressively fights convention with originality, satire and unflinching honesty, but loses in the end.
It is this conclusion that makes Ghost World such a victorious indie film — it shines a light on the depressingly familiar process many independent filmmakers undergo today in hopes of impacting the mainstream even when they often face a long and bumpy road ahead.

USC will be one of the new testing grounds for a $60 million Smart Grid demonstration conducted by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, a project that will test the efficiency and reliability of the city’s current energy grid.
The LADWP, in partnership with USC, UCLA and the Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was awarded the funding by the federal government as part of a larger $600 million grant to improve energy sources nationwide, according to LADWP’s press release.
The demonstration is part of President Obama’s 10-year energy plan to create 5 million new green jobs and a greener environment. Over $100 billion will be invested in green technologies to accelerate renewable energy sources and clean energy efficiency across the country, with $1 billion going to Los Angeles.
USC and UCLA will be two of the locations testing out the new energy technology. The demonstration includes the monitoring of energy consumption on campus and testing of new cyber-security technologies as well as the integration of numerous plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in order to note their effect on the energy grid.
“The objective is to enhance the information that’s available on campus with the goal of reducing energy consumption,” said Mark Bernstein, managing director of USC’s Energy Institute.
Bernstein said energy consumption will be monitored in on-campus residence halls, office buildings, laboratories, retail shops and restaurants to help LADWP figure out a more effective way of reducing the university’s consumption.
“We were just awarded the grant, so we have to sit out and plan how we’re going to use it,” Bernstein said “But the whole concept of the smart grid is that there’s information flowing between DWP and campus.”
USC, LADWP’s largest energy consumer, is working to transition into one of the city’s leaders in the use of renewable sources.
“It’s exactly what we’re looking for,” said Trieste Lockwood, the campaign coordinator for USC’s branch of the Sierra Club.
USC was chosen because it represents a microcosm of the city – a “micro-grid” where testing can be carried out in real-time – and because USC has large vehicle fleets, including the Campus Cruiser and Zipcar lines, Bernstein said. LADWP can test electric charging vehicles both in a controlled corporate environment, as well as on an individual basis.
The project will take place over the next 2-3 years on campus, and though students won’t immediately be aware of the changes, eventually all students will be involved in energy-saving practices, Bernstein added.
“It’s new so students don’t know, but students will very quickly be part of saving energy on campus,” he said.
Once information is gathered and new energy-efficient technologies are introduced on campus, it could play a role in how energy is used across the state.
“We want to let the city know we are leaders towards new technology,” Lockwood said. “Los Angeles is in a great position to set an example for the rest of the world.”
