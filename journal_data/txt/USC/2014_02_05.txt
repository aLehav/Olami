Arati Prabhakar, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, spoke to students and faculty in a presentation titled “Next: Breakthrough Technologies for National Security” at the Viterbi School of Engineering Wednesday afternoon.
DARPA is an agency of the United States Department of Defense that is primarily focused on scientific research and technological advancement. The agency conducts research in fields such as math, science and medicine, and develops technology for the United States military.
Before becoming director of DARPA in June 2012, Prabhakar founded the agency’s Microelectronics Technology Office and served as the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology under President Bill Clinton. Prabhakar also worked with startup tech companies as a partner with venture capital firm U.S. Venture Partners.
Prabhakar began her presentation by providing a brief history of the agency. She explained what role DARPA was intended to fill in United States national security.
Originally called the Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA was founded in 1958. The agency was created to fill the need for scientific advancement and technological progress in the aftermath of the Russian launch of Sputnik.
“When you talk to our colleagues in the Army and the Navy and the Air Force and the Marine Corps, they know us as the place from which technology emerged,” Prabhakar said. “They know us as the place where infrared night-vision technology, communications technology, positioning technology, emerged.”
The majority of Prabhakar’s talk, however, was focused on the future. She spoke about some of DARPA’s current goals and how the agency responds to the concerns raised by new technology.
According to Prabhakar, one of DARPA’s main areas of focus is space and satellite technology. These technologies are not only important in day-to-day civilian life, but in war zones and military activity as well.
“We are phenomenally dependent on space,” Prabhakar said, citing satellite usage in technologies such as GPS, communication and imaging. “We simply cannot fight without the greatest advantage that we have.”
Biological technologies were another important part of DARPA’s current work, Prabahakr said. She showed the audience a few projects that are currently being developed that would advance the speed of medicine. Engineered bio-organisms that can help treat disease and allow for more efficient diagnosis technology were among the projects mentioned.
Prabhakar also stated that DARPA was conducting research on brain function in order to learn more about                                                           little-understood biological processes. She shared a video of a quadriplegic woman who, through electric ports connected to her brain, was able to control a robotic arm as easily as a healthy person controlling his or her own arm.
“That for me was the real ‘Aha!’ moment,” Prabhakar said. “A door opened. We’re learning fundamental things about how the brain interacts with the physical world. It’s easy to imagine a future where we start harvesting that kind of information to start changing how humans interact with more complex systems.”
The ethical implications of new technology and the potential consequences of scientific advancement are also a concern of DARPA, Prabhakar said.
“Today’s national security threat is not just that kind of nation-state threat,” she said. “Because of easily available capital and technology, we have to be cognizant of the wide range of threats. It’s sobering to think about how these technologies might be used.”
She concluded her presentation by saying it is DARPA’s responsibility to investigate the new technologies and propose important ethical questions, but society will be the one to provide the final answers.
“I don’t want to live in a society where a bunch of technologists in the national security business make up answers to these deeply societal questions,” Prabhakar said. “Our role [as a society] is to raise the issue, engage the people and show them what the technology can and can’t do.”
Sounds all well and good, coming from a government employee… spouting platitudes about the ethical use of technology. So, we know where the money comes from to push the limits of technology. And we know who is doing the pushing… DARPA. But who is going to push the effort to make sure that society takes note of and engages in deciding how it wants that new technology used BEFORE it is brought to market? It’s nice to stand behind a podium and say “…society will be the one to provide the final answers.” The problem is, no one is responsible for marshaling society towards developing those answers… certainly not with the vigor and speed with which DARPA is pushing technology’s limits.

On Wednesday evening, the USC Political Student Assembly hosted a panel discussing the current state of U.S.-Mexico relations.
Across the Border · The Consul General of Mexico in Los Angeles Carlos M. Sada spoke about U.S.-Mexico relations on Wednesday evening. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The discussion featured Carlos M. Sada, the consul general of Mexico in Los Angeles as well as Stephen Cheung, director of international trade for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Two USC professors also participated in the event, moderator Carol Wise of the School of International Relations and Dr. Pamela K. Starr, director of the U.S.-Mexico Network at USC.
Sada began the discussion with a presentation of the economic relationship between Mexico and the U.S. He stated that despite a sometimes tenuous relationship, Mexico’s connection with the United States has improved.
“I think now there is a very good spirit of cooperation and collaboration and willingness to understand each other much better,” Sada said.
He also cautioned, however, that many issues continue to exist between the two countries.
“We have been partners — mainly with a very solid partnership — as of 1994 when NAFTA was signed,” Sada said. “We have a very unique and strategic relationship that is sometimes not well understood.”
NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was signed in 1994 and created the world’s largest free trade area between Mexico, the United States and Canada.
“We Mexicans and Americans are not informed about each other,” Sada said. “We need to do much, much better.”
One issue he highlighted was the lack of foreign students from Mexico. He stated that although about 750,000 foreign students study in the United States every year, only 14,000 are from Mexico.
“That is why we are invigorating the academic relationship between the United States and Mexico,” he said.
Starr also spoke of the importance of Mexico to the United States.
“No country has a greater impact on the daily lives of Americans than Mexico,” Starr said. “Mexico matters to jobs, to wages, to public health, to environmental protection, to energy security, as well as to the demographic construction of the United States.”
Cheung stated that Garcetti’s office was looking forward to broadening trade relations with Mexico.
“Between Mexico City and Los Angeles alone, according to the Brookings Institution, in 2012 there was $2 billion of trade between just those two cities,” he said.
Students at the event were interested in the consul’s presentation.
Kayla Caldwell, a sophomore majoring in international relations and economics, said she learned new information about USC’s outreach in Mexico.
“I came because it’s always a good opportunity to hear a consul speak,” Caldwell said. “I’ve never been to Mexico so I don’t know much about the region, but one thing I learned that was interesting was that there are so many engineering students from Mexico at USC in the program.”
Priya Gupta, a senior majoring in international relations (global business), also found the trade aspect of the discussion interesting.
“I thought it was a really great presentation — learning about the developing relationship that the consul and the mayor’s office are trying to establish between Mexico City and Los Angeles,” Gupta said.

The Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential candidates squared off Wednesday night in a debate held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Great debaters · (From left to right) Andrew Menard, Rini Sampath, James White, Brigid Kelly, Logan Heley and A.J. Pinto discuss issues such as campus safety, diversity and food options at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
 
Covering everything from cultural diversity to dining options on campus, the candidates vied for votes of the approximately 150 students in attendance.
Opening remarks focused on candidate platforms as well as their hopes for both USG and USC.
“We want student priorities to be top administrative priorities,” said Logan Heley, a junior presidential candidate.
Candidates also took the opportunity to introduce themselves, and explain why they felt they were most qualified for the position.
“We are passionate, we are qualified, we are authentic and, most importantly, we are balanced,” said Rini Sampath of her and her ticket’s platform.
The presidential debate, moderated by Professor Peter Robertson of the Sol Price School of Public Policy, began with a discussion of health and affordability of dining options on campus, but moved onto quickly more controversial issues.
The discussion took on a grave tone as candidates confronted issues surrounding diversity and safety on campus.
“Cultural awareness at USC is definitely an issue and it goes beyond the students,” said James White, a junior presidential candidate.
White believed there was room for improvement in campus diversity.
“I should not have to listen to a professor ask me if I was marching or protesting on Martin Luther King Day just because I am black,” White said.
The candidates made multiple suggestions to combat this issue, from a weeklong multicultural fair to increasing funding for on-campus diversity groups such as the Queer and Allied Student Assembly.
Sexual assault and harassment dominated the conversation regarding campus safety, with each candidate admitting to failures within the current protocol.
“When is the last time you talked to your friends about what consent is? Because that’s a hard conversation our school needs to have,” Heley said.
Overall, students responded favorably to both the debate and the candidates’ platforms.
“It was really good to hear what they all had to say. I thought they were all great,” said Max Lawlor, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health. “They’re all clearly going places in life.”
Others felt the platforms were, for the most part, alike, if only approached in different ways.
“Each slate was so similar, but Heley and Pinto were very straightforward while the other two played more to the emotions of the crowd,” said Syed Ibrahim, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
 
It was a great debate, every participants were full of  zeal which is very much important for healthy competition. The points made by each candidate to make the tutoring center superior were just stirring.

On Wednesday, 21-year-old Bryan Barnes, one of two men charged with the murder of two USC graduate students from China, pled guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. According to the Los Angeles Times, Barnes will serve two consecutive life terms and will not be granted parole.
On April 11, 2012, Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot by Barnes, 20 years old at the time, while parked outside in a neighborhood near campus.
According to the L.A. Times, Wu’s iPhone, which was stolen from the scene of the crime, linked L.A. police detectives to Barnes and his presumed accomplice, then 19-year-old Javier Bolden. Bolden’s trial has yet to be held.
Prosecutors said during preliminary hearings that the GPS in Wu’s phone led police to a warehouse where evidence implicated Barnes.
By court order, investigators were allowed to wiretap Barnes’ telephone conversations. According to the L.A. Times, in one call with Bolden, Barnes mentioned how they “ran up on them little Asian people,” implying that he had shot them.
A former girlfriend of Barnes testified that Barnes had admitted to stealing the cell phone and told her that someone may have been shot during the robbery.
Judge Stephen A. Marcus declared there was “more than enough evidence” in connecting Barnes and Bolden to the murders of Qu and Wu.

The USC men’s volleyball team looks to recover from a tough loss against BYU as they host UCSB tonight at the Galen Center in an Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference game. The Trojans (5-3, 4-3 MPSF) fell to the Cougars in five sets, 16-25, 25-22, 15-25, 25-20, 15-10. USC dropped to the fifth spot in the AVCA top 15 as the Gauchos (5-2, 4-2) climbed to No. 8 after sweeping a double-header against Hawai’i.
Killing it · Outside hitter Lucas Yoder was named the Off The Block National Freshman of the Week on Feb. 3 for the third time this season. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Despite the loss, freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder had a match-high 23 kills for the Trojans. Yoder was named the Off The Block National Freshman of the Week for the third time in five weeks for his performance. Junior outside hitter Cristian Rivera had 12 kills of his own, along with three aces. Sophomore outside hitter Alex Slaught had 11 kills and freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh had six blocks.
USC also outhit the Cougars .261 to .233, but could not stop BYU’s rally late in the game. After handily winning the first set thanks to hitting .600 and serving three aces, the Trojans fell behind early in the second set and never recovered. USC again jumped to an early lead in the third set and converted the lead to a win. The Trojans had an early lead in the fourth set, but lost the lead and eventually the set. The Cougars went on a 5-0 lead early in the final set and pulled away to win the match.
“We need to limit the number of errors we make,” said USC head coach Bill Ferguson. “We make errors at bad times and it hurts us in the end and it kills our momentum.”
The Gauchos are led on the offensive end by outside hitter Austin Kingi, who has amassed 84 kills in seven games. On the defensive side of the ball, setter Jonah Seif leads the team with 48 digs. The squad’s only losses this year have come at the hands of two of the country’s top teams, No. 1 UCLA and No. 9 UC Irvine.
The Trojans average 14.2 kills per set while the Gauchos average only 11.71. What the Gauchos lack in offensive firepower, they make up for by minimizing errors. USC has 181 errors this year to UCSB’s 143.
Tonight’s game against the Gauchos is the first of two home games this week for the Trojans, leading up to Sunday’s match against UCLA at 6 p.m.
“We need to come together and play as a team and not as individuals,” Ferguson said. “If we do that, we’ll be in good shape.”
The match begins tonight at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.

The other day, I caught myself doing something embarrassing. I was perusing the internet and realized that I was looking up recruiting rankings. But not just glancing. I was legitimately researching. And what’s more, I was legitimately caring. I somehow found these kids and their impending decisions important.
To many, this is all just part of being a college football fan. National Signing Day is a day unlike any other, the culmination of months of anticipation for fans and years of hard work for coaching staffs. But see, I always thought signing day was stupid. In fact, I was planning on writing a column on just how stupid and pointless it was. I looked through the last decade of USC recruiting and Rivals 100 players, determined to prove that it really all meant nothing.
Unfortunately for me, that’s not what I found.
Signing day is not the be-all-end-all, of course. As is always evident in the NFL draft, projecting a player’s talent at the “next level” is a very inexact science; generally nothing more than educated guesses. And yet, these educated guesses very often turn out to be right.
Adrian Peterson, DeSean Jackson, Tim Tebow, Cam Newton, Julio Jones, Robert Woods, Marcus Lattimore, Jadeveon Clowney — those are just some of the coveted five-star recruits (according to Rivals) over the last decade. Of course, more hardcore USC fans are likely to remember names like Kyle Prater and Dillon Baxter, both five-star recruits in 2010 (Prater was actually the No. 3 overall recruit in the nation) who didn’t exactly pan out at Troy.
So while the Signing Day universe is sprinkled with its fair share of highly-sought recruits who will turn the way of Prater and Baxter, many more will serve in key roles for their programs over the next few years. Su’a Cravens, Nelson Agholor, Woods: those are just some of the five-star recruits USC has signed over the last three years who have developed into some of the Trojans’ most important players.
In 2009, USC signed three five-star recruits: quarterback Matt Barkley, defensive back T.J. McDonald and defensive lineman Devon Kennard. All three became team captains, and McDonald was a First-Team All-American his junior season.
Of course, that’s not to say it’s only the top-rated recruits who end up as superstars — or fall flat. Marqise Lee was a four-star recruit and considered a defensive back out of high school. Leonard Williams, one of the most dominant players in the country last year, was also a four-star prospect. Buck Allen and former running back Curtis McNeal were both three-star recruits. On the flip side, offensive linemen Kevin Graf and Aundrey Walker were both four-star recruits, and both were decidedly less than stellar in recent seasons.
And yet, the feeling I got yesterday was undeniable. I cared. I got butterflies watching eventual USC commit and consensus five-star prospect Adoree’ Jackson ham it up before announcing his decision. Two hours later, John “JuJu” Smith made me feel the same way. The USC Athletic Department put out a video that shows the reaction in the John McKay Center, which was akin to a game-winning touchdown: cheers, high fives, hugs — you name it.
In many ways it is embarrassing to care so much about where a 17-year-old decides to attend college. It’s a little bit sad, too. But you know what, as much as we might try to deny it — and I know I certainly did — it matters. And I admit it: I care.
But that doesn’t mean I’m not embarrassed.

The defending NCAA champion USC women’s water polo team will begin the 2014 season this Saturday as the No. 1 pick in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and College Water Polo Assocation national preseason polls.
Skipper · Senior two-meter Madeline Rosenthal scored 23 goals last year and looks to lead her team to a second straight national championship. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Last season, the Women of Troy took home their third NCAA title and simultaneously made history, defeating Stanford 10-9 in five overtimes, the longest match in women’s water polo championship game history. The team recognizes the challenge of defending its title.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” senior captain Madeline Rosenthal said. “If you’re ranked No. 1 it’s a target on your back. People see you as the team to take down. We’re ranked No. 1 because we won NCAA last year and we’re happy about that, but it’s in the past. Now we’re focusing on holding that spot.”
This year’s team is younger than most, with nine freshmen on the roster. Though training young athletes can be a challenge, the more seasoned players are excited to have a crop of new talent on the team.
“It’s great having fresh bodies in the pool. We have to push them strategically, but they have lots of energy, they’re fast, they’re pushing us in training, and they’re learning the system,” Rosenthal said. “Every year is a new year. This is my fourth year here, and looking at them is exciting because I can see all the potential that they have.”
For the new athletes, realizing that potential has taken hard work. Freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis described the challenge of adjusting to the team’s complex system.
“The most difficult thing has been learning the system, but I’m getting through it,” Haralabidis said. “It’s different [than high school]. I’ve never had so many practices in my entire life, but I’m really enjoying it. I love my teammates, and we’re making so much progress together.”
According to coaching staff, all that practice seems to be paying off as the team approaches the start of the season.
“Practices have been very competitive, very compelling. This team looks very eager to play,” said associate head coach Marko Pintaric. “We’re looking forward to our opening weekend, and seeing the girls in action for the first time. It’s a young team, and we’re looking forward to seeing what they bring to the table.”
The team will compete this weekend at the Triton Invitational Tournament in San Diego.
“A lot of good teams are going to be there, so we’re just preparing basically to run our system and to focus on ourselves and hopefully that will get us results,” said senior driver Kelly Mendoza. “Every other team has played multiple games so far, so we’re just really excited to finally get out there and show everyone what we can do.”
Under the instruction of head coach Jovan Vavic, a 12-time National Coach of the Year, the team feels well prepared to face its competition. This season will mark Vavic’s 20th year with USC’s women’s water polo program. Though his achievements speak for themselves, Vavic’s unique coaching style has proven highly effective in building a solid team.
“Jovan is, as the record proves, the best coach in the United States,” Pintaric said. “He’s a defensive coach, so his focus on the defense is a very important part of our equation, but he really addresses all of the issues the team could have.”
One of the issues the team faces each year is the prevention of injuries. Given the demanding nature of the sport and the minimal protective gear used during a game, the athletes take extra precautions to avoid injuring themselves.
“The most common injuries in water polo are shoulder and hip injuries, and knees, and you always have to watch out for concussions,” Mendoza said. “We do a lot of work in the weight room, like bands and stretches, in the hopes of preventing what we can, but our sport is so aggressive that sometimes you can’t help it.”
There is much more to the team than just training. Many of the athletes also attribute their success as a team to the amount of bonding they do outside of the pool.
“We do team activities and community service, stuff that the school wants us to do, but we also just hang out,” Mendoza said. “We’re all so close, we don’t have to worry about setting team bonding events because we’re constantly bonding outside of the water. It’s so much fun and we’re always learning from each other.”
Despite intense preparation and excellent coaching, the team had a turbulent preseason due to the loss of a fellow USC water polo player in freshman Jon Walters. Though Walters played for the men’s team, his passing shocked the tight-knit group of players.
“The morale has been how it can be, especially given Jon’s personality,” Pintaric said. “He touched every single player, every single member of our Trojan family. The girls … reacted very emotionally.”
In the upcoming season, the  women’s team plans to put together a fundraising effort for the Walters family and the memorial scholarship fund created in Jon’s name.
“I think they’re reacting in a positive way. I don’t see anything lacking when they come to practice,” Pintaric said. “They’re still eager to play, they still compete, but they’re doing their part to help the family, to help remember Jon. It takes a lot of positive emotions to get through such a crisis as a team.”
Now stronger than ever, the Women of Troy are looking forward to the rest of the season and the intense competition they will face.
“We’ll be up against the usual suspects. The top nine teams usually don’t change,” Pintaric said. “Stanford is always exciting just because of the quality of play. The UCLA game, that’s going to be a great game. And Cal has recruited a very talented young class, so those games will be really exciting. It should be a lot of fun for us.”
The season is worthless. The whole thing is the final four which almost always consists of three of the four
large schools in California plus a throw away to play the #1 seed.

USC head coach Steve Sarkisian finished off his 2014 recruiting campaign with a bang on National Signing Day. With 15 commitments coming into the day, the Trojans had their eye on three of the top four prospects in California. Sarkisian was able to make a clean sweep, as  offensive tackle Damien Mama and athletes Adoree’ Jackson and John “JuJu” Smith all signed their letters of intent. All three prospects were given   five-star ratings by Scout.com. In addition, the team garnered a commitment from Jacksonville, Fla. defensive back Lamont Simmons, a consensus three-star recruit.
Sign me up · Steve Sarkisian’s recruiting class received a boost yesterday with the additions of OL Damien Mama (Bellflower, Calif.), Ath. Adoree’ Jackson (Gardena, Calif.), and Ath. John “JuJu” Smith (Long Beach, Calif.). – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After an exciting finish to his first signing day as USC’s head coach, Sarkisian voiced his enthusiasm.
“It is … a pretty exciting week to be a Trojan,” Sarkisian said. “[It’s like being] in the fourth quarter of a game … and finishing really well.”
The four commitments the Trojans secured on Wednesday vaulted their class into the top 10 nationally. In addition, many scouting services, including ESPN and 247Sports, have the Trojans as the highest-rated group in the Pac-12. The day started early, with Mama out of St. John Bosco-Bellflower announcing his commitment at 8 a.m. Shortly after, Simmons committed. The news continued to get better for the Trojans when Jackson, the versatile athlete out of Serra-Gardena, announced his intention to attend USC. Finally, the day reached its apex with the commitment of Smith, a coveted athlete out of perennial powerhouse Long Beach Poly.
Smith and Jackson added two more dynamic athletes to an already blazing fast 2014 class. Sarkisian placed a strong emphasis on building his program around these types of athletes.
“We needed more receiver/defensive back body types — for offense and defense, and also special teams,” Sarkisian said. “We really nailed it today.”
Smith will start out on the offensive side of the ball, as will recruited athletes Rahshead Johnson and Ajene Harris. Sarkisian was also able to lock up a deep group of talented offensive linemen to complement the multitude of speedsters. Headlined by Mama, Toa Lobendahn and Chris Brown, the class will provide relief for a group that Sarkisian said was “a big position of need just from sheer depth.”
Sarkisian also outlined his formula for recruiting moving forward, finding long, rangy athletes at every position on defense to compete with the fast offenses of the Pac-12. One recruit Sarkisian is especially excited about is Uchenna Nwosu, a local safety from Narbonne High School who could see time as a linebacker.
The staff was able to collaborate effectively with holdovers from the previous coaching regime — Clay Helton and Tee Martin had a major impact on this year’s recruiting class.
“They both did a fantastic job in transition, allowing it to feel almost seamless,” Sarkisian said.
During a lighter moment, Sarkisian praised Helton’s closing ability while complimenting his Southern charm.
USC football’s coaching staff scrambled madly over  the last two-and-a-half weeks to put together this class, with impressive results. Overall, USC landed 12 new commitments since Sarkisian was hired, catapulting the Trojans back into the national spotlight.
You did not mention Viane T. who had committed to Alabama early, and could be the best of the lineman
since the Crimson Tide knows best. Why does the Daily Trojan sports staff make numerous errors and
omissions in their articles time after time?
I have to admit I was surprised and very happy the way everything fell into place at the end of the day.
Congratulations Coach Sarkisian

Tune in, turn on, but don’t drop out when Trojan Vision — USC’s student-operated television station — returns to the air on Monday.
“Trojan Vision is completely student run, student created,” General Manager Harrison Merkt said. “We basically have a network that we are all interested in and we hope that our interests are reflective of USC students … Trojan Vision is really a way to get their opinions out on the air, create something and influence other students and get their voices heard.”
The network is made up of several different shows — whether it’s the cooking program, Delish, or the stage show, Mind Game, some will be returning from last semester and others will be brand new.
One show that will be returning is The Morning Brew, a daily morning show that Executive Producer Vanessa Gomez said involves everything from host banter to on-campus correspondence to guest segments — basically anything one would see on The Today Show or Good Morning America.
“[Students] should tune into The Morning Brew because it’s geared toward the students and the content is more age appropriate,” Gomez said. “On the other side of things, we do talk about entertainment news for anything in the world, but we give it a college student perspective. You aren’t listening to someone in their 30s giving their opinion.”
In addition to relating more to the host because of the similarity in age, the program seeks to connect even more with their audience by introducing live tweeting throughout the show to give viewers the opportunity to interact with the host and get their opinions on the show.
“We actually have a social media person on The Morning Brew team who is basically in charge of that,” Gomez said. “We have a lot of followers on our Facebook page, and we’re going to try to get people to follow us on Twitter … I know that TV as a whole is hoping to promote more viewership with the students — really just trying to get the students more involved, word-of-mouth, social media.”
Another interesting feature of the network is a show called The Flagship, a nightly, 30-minute interview talk show with guests ranging from those with backgrounds in entertainment and music to authors and entrepreneurs. The show returns Monday with Jeffrey Hornaday, a choreographer known for working with many of Hollywood’s top-billed actors and directors.
George Wasserman, a junior majoring in communication and executive producer of CU@USC, said his goal this semester is to bring in even bigger names to get students interested in coming in and being a studio audience member. Wasserman said many of the network’s most famous guests have appeared on CU@USC, Trojan Vision’s oldest show that has been running for 16 years.
“It is the most professional college television show in the nation by far,” he said. “No one is doing what we are doing — spitting out five nights a week with professionals. We’ve had people like George Lucas, Patrick Stewart. Last semester we had Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dennis Mukwege. We’ve had Anderson Cooper, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. We bring in big names and we’re completely student-run and we have the ability to pull in people that no other college in the nation can pull.”
Merkt said that one of the reasons they are able to attract so many guests is through alumni.
“The USC network is pretty incredible,” Merkt said. “It’s really a USC family — people are always wanting to give back and support this group. For example, we had Jason Segel on as an interviewer, and the reason we got him was through one of the USC classes called the film symposium.”
Though it might be challenging to run a television network while keeping up with the responsibilities of being a college student, Trojan Vision shows no signs of slowing down.
“We’re growing as a station — we have more managers working than ever and our class continues to grow,” Merkt said. “I think right now we have the most programming on air than we ever have before. I think we have been improving and we continue to grow, and more and more people come with really great ideas.”
One of the advantages to working for Trojan Vision is that anyone of any grade level can move up in the ranks and take on a leadership role.
“Last semester, one of our brand new shows was called Countdown,” Merkt said, “Two sophomores … they have this amazing show. They created a pilot and everything. Theirs was best among the others. They did a great job on it, and now it’s coming back this semester … It doesn’t matter what year you are. They’re in charge of 50 plus students who were on their team.”
Though the constantly fluctuating staff can be challenging at times, Gomez said the changes overall proves advantageous by bringing a new energy every semester.
“It does also have its negatives, because especially as a showrunner, you want to take your show to the next level, but you have new producers coming in each semester,” Gomez said. “But in the same way, it’s a fun experience because you’re teaching a new set of producers. Another positive is that even though you get a new set of producers, your old producers from the previous semesters come back and help with the show, and help you grow it to where you want it to go.”
To promote student involvement, Merkt said they are putting on two main events: a party at Tommy’s Place with a live band to kick off the new season, and an open mic night with student performances at the station. The open mic night is tonight at 7:30 p.m. and the party at Tommy’s Place will take place Saturday at 9:30 p.m.
Gomez said students don’t have to be in a particular class or position to participate in the process, and getting involved means any number of things.
“We have encouraged every student to try and get involved, be it a producing spot or just tuning in for a half hour a day,” Gomez said. “We really do want to hear from the students … If you are not happy with what you see on Trojan Vision, then let us know, because the student opinion is what we really want. We want the shows to be interesting and if they have any suggestions, anything that they’d want to see, then give us the idea, because we really do care.”

The villain has been captured, beaten and tied to a chair, but he’s still the one in control. He sits motionless, unnerving our heroes with his silence and composure. Then his blue eyes open, piercing the droning gloom of the airplane cabin before settling on superspy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). The eyes take the measure of the man, sweeping him for weaknesses and finding a whopper. Then comes the voice, a drowsy drawl spiked with serpent’s venom.
The Talented Mr. Hoffman · Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died last Sunday in New York City, was one of the finest actors of his generation.– Photo courtesy of Associated Press
“What the hell is your name? You have a wife? A girlfriend? Because you know what I’m going to do next? I’m gonna find her, whoever she is, I’m gonna find her, and I’m gonna hurt her.”
On paper, this is generic bad guy dialogue, the kind regularly spouted by any number of transposable big-screen heavies. But as delivered by Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing slovenly arms dealer Owen Davian in J.J. Abrams’s Mission: Impossible III, it’s the stuff of nightmares. Why? Maybe it’s the way Hoffman frames the line as a promise rather than a threat, foregoing any hint of theatrical villainy. Davian isn’t stroking a white cat or affecting a posh accent; he’s a vicious, vindictive thug willing to go to unspeakable lengths to prolong his enemy’s suffering. In contrast to the fantastical stunts and storylines that make up the rest of the film, Hoffman’s casual sadist feels nauseatingly real. This was the actor’s great gift: the ability to elevate and enliven any project he worked on, from Broadway plays (Death of a Salesman) and festival circuit gems (The Savages) to Hollywood blockbusters (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire).
The worlds of stage and screen suffered an immeasurable loss last Sunday when Hoffman was found dead in his Manhattan apartment, the victim of an apparent heroin overdose, a habit he had privately struggled with for years. The actor, widely considered one of the greatest of his generation, leaves behind an eclectic, incomparable body of work that spanned over two decades and nearly 60 films. Although he was often recognized for his transformative, Oscar-winning turn as Truman Capote in Bennett Miller’s eponymous 2005 film, Hoffman had already spent years becoming an accomplished character actor, embodying roles that ran the gamut from lonesome dreamers to loathsome schemers.
After years of bit parts in movies such as Scent of a Woman, Hoffman scored a supporting role in writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1997 porn industry epic Boogie Nights, where he played a bashful, overweight boom-mike operator who develops an unhealthy infatuation with adult film star Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg). A year later he appeared in the Coen Brothers’ The Big Lebowski as Brandt, a born yes-man whose sycophantic devotion to his aged boss makes The Simpsons’ Smithers seem subdued by comparison, and turned in an utterly fearless performance as a chronic masturbator in Todd Solondz’s pitch-black comedy Happiness.
The critical acclaim Hoffman received from Boogie Nights and Happiness propelled his career forward, allowing him to collaborate with the likes of Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley and reteam with Anderson for his San Fernando Valley ensemble piece Magnolia, where he played a male nurse attending to a TV producer with terminal cancer. He also gave one of his all-time greatest performances in Cameron Crowe’s Almost Famous as Lester Bangs, the homebody rock critic who urges the film’s young protagonist (Patrick Fugit) to be “honest and unmerciful” toward his preening, drug-addled subjects. Despite only appearing in a few scenes, Hoffman’s character provides that film with its spirit of bruised optimism, especially when he delivers this crucial line: “The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what we share with someone else when we’re uncool.”
The next few years afforded Hoffman the chance to expand his already considerable range, playing a meddling journalist who gets flambéed by a serial killer (Ralph Fiennes) in the Hannibal Lecter prequel Red Dragon and an introverted high school teacher with a crush on one of his students in Spike Lee’s 25th Hour. He also stole nearly all of his scenes as a petulant former child star in Ben Stiller’s gross-out comedy Along Came Polly, a movie that peaks in quality the moment when Hoffman’s character explains what the word “sharted” means.
Shortly after his Oscar win for Capote, the increasingly in-demand actor co-starred with Ethan Hawke in Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead, the final work by legendary director Sidney Lumet (Dog Day Afternoon, 12 Angry Men). The film, a crime drama revolving around two brothers who unwisely plan to rob a jewelry store owned by their elderly parents, features Hoffman performing what is arguably the best wordless trashing of a room since Citizen Kane.
The late 2000s seemed to bring out of the best in Hoffman. While critics were divided on the merits of adapting Doubt from the Pulitzer-winning stage play, they agreed that he was marvelous as a Catholic priest plagued by allegations of sexual abuse, setting off a wave of accolades that ended in yet another Best Supporting Actor nomination – he’d been nominated the previous year for playing an eccentric CIA official in Charlie Wilson’s War. Hoffman also gave his most compelling lead performance in Charlie Kaufman’s brilliantly maddening directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, where he portrayed a dying New York theater director obsessed with committing the totality of his life to the stage.
Hoffman’s career-defining role, however, is undoubtedly Lancaster Dodd in Anderson’s The Master, a film destined to be reevaluated as a modern American classic. His honey-toned spiritual charlatan is all airtight bluster and mannered grandiosity, at least until he confronts a dissenter head-on and the cracks begin to show. The scene where he “processes” the twitchy, possibly psychotic Freddy (Joaquin Phoenix) is absolutely spellbinding, like witnessing two finely tuned instruments duel in unison. It’s a shame that one of them has now fallen silent. Yes, a great talent has taken his leave of this world, and the world can’t help but feel poorer for his passing.
Landon McDonald is a graduate student studying public relations.  His column, “The Reel Deal,” runs Thursdays.
 
So the takeaway from Mr. Hoffman’s life and death is that drugs aren’t such a good thing after all, even if our government eases its stance on legalization.

The word “bloom” takes on many meanings in Georgia’s official entry for Best Foreign Language Film in the 86th Academy Awards, In Bloom. This is the directorial debut for Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gross, with a coming-of-age story that follows 14-year-olds and inseparable friends, Eka and Natia, as they navigate growing up in the ’90s in the capital city of the newly independent Georgia. As the country teeters on the edge of war and bloodshed following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the two teens are surrounded by school, friends and family as they face issues of love and early marriage. The Daily Trojan spoke with the two filmmakers about the inspiration behind the story, the power of a female protagonist and more. In Bloom opens at Laemmle Theaters in Los Angeles tomorrow.
DT: What inspired you to direct this film?
Ekvtimishvili: I left Georgia in the ’90s and went to Germany to study. Everything in the film is related to my life at the time. Eka is the character that is very close to me. Natia’s character is also very close to me. A lot of the friends in the movie were extensions of my own friends. Natia’s feelings of revenge were very close to me because as a teenage girl, you don’t know if someone might hurt you or your friends. You are not able to reflect as an adult when you are still young.
DT: What challenges did you face while directing this movie?
Ekvtimishvili: The film is very personal for me, but on the other hand, if you create a character and if you write a script, this character has his [or] her own life. So you have also some kind of distance with the members of the film. Otherwise, you are not able to write or tell the story factually. During the writing, I had the feeling I was writing about some other person. To do this film, it helped me a lot to talk to Simon. What I see could be different from what Gross saw. I’m from Tbilisi, he’s from Berlin. Somehow we discovered some universal elements that were good for this film.
Gross: Well actually we were living in Berlin when I read the script for the first time. This was my first connection; of course I knew Ekvtimishvili already at the time. I felt a personal connection with Ekvtimishvili and the need to tell a story about a country I didn’t know. For the movie, we had questions about what time period this was, the political background, what costumes people wear. The script was very straight and characters were very emotional for me when I read the script. I had no problems connecting.
DT: There are not usually many female protagonists in movies. Why did you choose two female girls to lead the film instead of two young boys?
Ekvtimishvili: The reason is that I am also a woman, and it is connected to my personal experience. At the time, as you see also in film, there are two parts of society — also woman and man. When boys get together separately, this point of view from the woman is another view of happenings at the time. For men, the perspective is often from war or street fights. As a woman, you see other things because you are not really in a hot point. This is the view you want to share with others.
DT: Natia and Eka’s friendship serves as an escape from their own turbulent lives with their families. What were you trying to portray to viewers about friendship?
Ekvtimishvili: When you have a friend of the same age and has the same questions as you do, you are somehow addicted to this friendship. As you see, in both families there is no place for dialogue where people can tell each other how they feel and how they think. They don’t do this in an intellectual way. They do it very intuitively because they are from a very related nature. They have the same spirit. In the ’90s also, in my family and other families, we did not have time to even talk about things. There were so many problems — what we can do tomorrow, what we can eat tomorrow. Friendship is somehow where you can feel free.
Gross: In Natia’s family, there’s fighting all the time. In Eka’s family, the father’s not there all the time. For them, waiting in the breadline is something more interesting for them. Also in the school, there are the boys to talk about. This is a normal teenage topic to be excited about.
DT: Your film does not contain a continuous musical score. What was your intention in doing this? How do you think this impacts the viewer’s experience?
Gross: The main idea was to tell a story which really comes from the characters — to stay authentic. There was really no need for music because the film is about the two girls. It is about what they feel that can be transported. The signing scene is the same song as the one at Natia’s birthday and the one Lado’s friends are playing on the guitar.
DT: What differences in Georgia do you see?
Ekvtimishvili: The people are the same. This film portrays Georgia in the ’90s because that is when I was familiar with. Also today, we see many different types of problems — many involving politicians.
DT: It is surprising that Lado’s gift to Natia is a gun. As soon as he gives it to her, we are curious as to what she will do with it. What was the purpose of giving Natia the gun?
Ekvtimishvili: At the time, a gun was a big deal. A lot of people had it. It was even easy for teenagers to get a gun on the street. Anybody that had a gun was changed. They had the power to change something — to show you that they were powerful. They could kill someone or simply make you afraid. In the film, the girls do not use the gun. But when I wrote the script, I was not trying to think of some original, dramatic way to shoot it. The girls use this gun in their own way. It comes also from my personal experience. I mentioned my revenge feelings as a teenage girl. I think I decided at the time, if I did not have a gun, I could go another way. Yet, I tried to ignore my revenge feelings. I understood that it made no sense to act upon them.
DT: There was a defining moment in the film when two men equipped with weapons are able to cut the line at the bread station. What is the role of weapons in the movie?
Ekvtimishvili: At the time, there was a war in Georgia, and there were many military people. Many did not know what to think of the military. In general, though, there was a negative attitude toward military soldiers because they participated in a lot of criminal activity. Georgian people were robbing Georgians. People were very poor, and they had nothing to eat. In war, everybody shows their true nature. In this kind of situation, if you have power — if you have a gun — it separates you from other normal people. Soldiers were allowed to cut in line for bread — the message was that they did not have to wait if they were fighting a war. There was a big distance between normal people and military people. People were also afraid because those who had guns would pull the trigger over small issues. It was really unpredictable.
DT: Why did you decide to end the movie with the scene of Eka visiting her father?
Gross: This was a kind of decision that Eka could not do were she not Natia’s friend. Natia is the reason Eka goes to the prison to visit her father. Eka witnessed how easy it was to kill someone. Maybe she didn’t understand her father, but she was ready to listen. By the end of the film, she was ready to hear the truth.
The film is very personal for me… sad Nana Ekvtimishvili. And what is wonderful, that the film became very personal for all whom watching film with tears in ayes

A brief story illustrates the problem that arises when causation and correlation are mixed together. Take for example the tale of the misguided czar, who noticed that the province in his kingdom with the highest rates of sickness was also the province that contained the most doctors. His solution? He ordered that all of the doctors be shot.
It is for this reason that when the Congressional Budget Office releases a report outlining that the Affordable Care Act will lead to job loss of 2.3 million, as they did on Tuesday, the critically minded reader should be skeptical. Though the political right would have you believe that the law is a job killer, a look at the facts demonstrates the grossly misleading nature of such a claim.
The CBO concludes that the ACA is an “implicit,” or indirect tax on both labor and laborers, which is to say that it will increase the cost of being employed and the cost of employing. The result, according to the CBO, is the loss of 2.3 million jobs over the next 10 years.
First, some context. A misleading interpretation of the headlines would lead readers to believe that over the next decade, 2.5 million workers will be fired, or that 2.3 million jobs will not be offered. Neither of these facts is true. The report argues that people who are currently unemployed and looking to transition to full-time work (now with the benefit of health insurance) will be discouraged from doing so because it would be more effective to seek part-time work and collect a government subsidy for insurance than to seek full-time work and forego the subsidy. Instead, the CBO argues, they will work a job for fewer hours, keeping their pay low enough to qualify for a particular government subsidy.
Then, the political trickery begins. To make those numbers — numbers that are purely measurements of the total number of hours that people who will be already employed will not work — more potent, the good folks at the CBO quantified the reduction in hours they expect workers to work in terms of their equivalent to job loss. The result? An incredibly misleading claim that the law will cause 2.3 million jobs to be lost.
At worst, ACA tampers with the incentive scheme — but does it actually leave workers worse off? Now that we know the law won’t actually cause people to lose their jobs, or even to lower their chances of getting hired, what will it do to them? In other words, compare the law’s proposed change to the status quo, where workers remain trapped in certain jobs for the sole reason that they provide health insurance. The ACA’s pre-existing conditions reform and increased subsidies break the chain tying coverage to certain jobs, and allow more mobility between jobs. The pessimistic CBO calls it “job loss.” But for a worker who would otherwise have to turn down a higher paying job because it doesn’t offer insurance calls it opportunity.
Politically, that’s how the Democrats should explain it: They know that their Republican colleagues have already gotten their super PACs on the phone, and the war machines are roaring away with attack ad after attack ad, preparing to call the law a “job killer.” The best thing the Democrats can do is point out that the CBO report disputes every Republican who said the law would hurt the private sector’s ability to hire, because the CBO shows that it’s blatantly not true — it attributes the “job loss” claim to the behavior of workers, not firms.
When the misguided czar shot the doctors, no one was surprised when overall rates of sickness went up. Likewise, no one should be surprised that the ACA won’t kill jobs.

Liberty Minded,
I am confused:
1) I tried to use my Anthem Blue Cross coverage to buy a 1978 Pinto from Cal Worthington Ford in Long Beach. Alas, I had to opt for Ford Motor Credit. Apparently, I can only use my insurance for medical services.  But I thought…I thought it was “unrelated” to health care!
2) No, no. The biggest “tax-and-welfare scheme” in history was rolled out in ’88:
“Congress shall have the power…to TAX and spend for the general WELFARE.”
Some ivory tower liberal elitist from Princeton proposed that. Socialism has been tearing us up ever since.
3) Purchasing power of those no longer burdened by crushing medical debts alone may make up for the purported net losses.
Stay mindful, liberty.
Mr. Daniel is Rockin’ the School House. Word to the 562.
Stop pretending that Obamacare is related to health care. Obamacare is a tax and welfare scheme. News flash – the IRS was in close contact with the Whitehouse for months during the debate and implementation of the PPACA.
New taxes are extra costs to companies. With money going to taxes, there is less for other things – benefits to employees, reserves, profits, new employees, new equipment, investment, …
To state that Obamacare will cost jobs is only one factor. It could just as easily cost time, or benefits, or improvements. If it costs $1 dollar to pay the “penalty” per employee, the business will have to either make another dollar to pay (usually businesses need to make $40 in order to create $1 in profits)  for it or create $1 dollar in savings in order to stay in business. The easiest way for businesses to save costs is to let weaker employees go.

Last Wednesday, Norwegian lawmakers Baard Vegar Solhjell and Snorre Valen nominated former CIA and National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize for his disclosures about the government spy program, according to the Guardian.
Mollie Berg and Matt Burke | Daily Trojan
 
Given the caliber of previous recipients, it is surprising to see Snowden equated with honorable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and President Barack Obama. Though supporters of the nomination argue that Snowden’s actions led to a vital dialogue about trust and security, Snowden’s actions were anything but peaceful.
The Nobel Peace Prize has honored 126 Laureates since its initiation in 1901, according to its official website. In his will, Alfred Nobel dictated the broad criteria by which nominations would henceforth be made, highlighting that the Peace Prize should be awarded to “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”
Let’s consider more closely the reasons for which Snowden’s nomination stands. Undoubtedly, Snowden’s NSA revelations resulted in a much-needed inspection of the nation’s mass surveillance program. The manner in which this discussion was accomplished, however, was neither efficient nor in the public’s best interest. It stems back to the central controversy of the issue — the fundamental balance between privacy and protection, and to what extent the government is able to work in the name of the greater good.
Still, the root of the concern might be the insecurity we feel as a generation. In an age when everything is electronic, social media users are constantly putting information, often of a very sensitive nature, onto the World Wide Web. With boundaries more blurred than ever, it’s understandable that the nation would panic at the thought of any personal data being compromised, when in reality, we are the cause of the issue.
According to the Washington Post’s foreign affairs blogger Max Fisher, the root of the controversy can divide Americans into multiple distinct camps. One camp views Snowden as a traitor who revealed sensitive information regarding the United States’ programs — revelations that have since resulted in serious negative political issues with foreign countries, allies and adversaries alike.
On the other hand, revealing the nature of these programs permits a second group of Americans to view him as a hero, resulting in a greater need to question the actions that the government is allowed to take. Though both viewpoints are understandable, the fact remains that there’s merit to both. As a journalist, or self-proclaimed advocate for the truth, he had the responsibility to consider the effect of his actions before revealing such vital information. Charged as he is with a violation of the Espionage Act, he should be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was acting in the best interest of the public. Given the stark differences in opinions, that is very unlikely. He should have known better.
Bringing important ethical issues into an international spotlight is no small feat, but the manner in which Snowden did so, if not purely wrong and reckless, is surely not worthy of recognition by such a high honor. Perhaps, in time, his actions will be viewed as justifiable. But regardless of the ends, if the means are questionable, they certainly aren’t worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Given the foreign policy blunders that occurred under the Bush administration, I think that the NPP was given to President Obama because the international community’s image of the United States was at an all time low. With regards to Snowden, I agree with the author of this article. After the events of 9/11, I feel for the most part that the actions of the NSA are necessary to combat terrorism and other threats both domestic and foreign. To leak millions of documents that pertain to national security and then to seek asylum in a country that already has complicated relations with the United States makes one traitor not a hero. If another 9/11 happened in the near future, those in the intelligence community will be the first to be blamed for “not doing enough”. Comparing Snowden to the figures like Dr. King and Nelson Mandela would be irresponsible. There are legal protections to protect “whistleblowers”, protections that Snowden should have considered. At the end of the day, this man is not a hero but rather a big gossip that has made America more prone to security threats.
Stick to bio, please.
How else would we have found out about this?
And listing President Obama as an honorable figure is debatable, to say the least.
Snowden deserves the prize, in my eyes.  When corruption of authority is exposed, in this case violating our inalienable rights of privacy, the whistleblowers and watchdogs will ALWAYS be declared to be reckless and irresponsible.  Because the hierarchy of power seeks to keep the status quo in tact, and doesn’t want to be disturbed.
To quote: Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the first Pirate Party, which campaigns for sensible information policy:
“Manning’s revelations to the world, made at great sacrifice, spurred democratic movements in many repressed countries. Snowden’s revelations made it possible to have a meaningful debate about the balance between national security and individual liberty.
But I’d argue that the reasons for giving the Peace Prize to Snowden and Manning go deeper, much deeper, than the individual sacrifice coupled with the immediate and profound global results.
Courage and transparency both make wars impossible
First, courage. The ability to wage war hinges on military leaders’ ability to make soldiers – often drafted, non-consenting soldiers – kill other people without having the ability to refuse, under threat of getting killed themselves. In many wars, there have been heroes who have shown courage to defy such orders. We typically celebrate them. When those heroes become many, the war effort fails as a whole – and that’s why they are usually singled out for brutal, disproportional, and harsh punishment, in attempts to prevent the spread of courage and morality among the soldiers.
Both Snowden and Manning have shown exemplary and outstanding courage in defying military and paramilitary power structures for the greater good of humanity.”
Interesting that you are equating Barack Hussein Obama with Mandela and King as worthy recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. Obama has not done anything in his life to warrant this award. I’m defending Snowdon, but you justification that. Obama was a better candidate thanSnowden is wrong.
What snowden did was, to some degree, a traitorous act, but on the other hand, he made public the NSA’s unconsitutional abuse of power, and the NSa is run from the White House.
I have never understood why Obama was awarded the NPP because when it was awarded he had accomplished absolutely nothing to promote peace in the world, and today, he is still afailure. But then again, you may also agree that Arafat deserved it to, yet he was a terrorist.
Look at the results, are the hostile nations of the earth launching new wars since Edward Snowden started his crusade against illegal, unsavory, secret government surveillance?There may be tension between the nations, but that was already there – only hidden. Now the population of the world knows what the nations’ security forces are doing. The more we know about the rulers the better we can watch them and keep them from launching illegal wars.

On Wednesday, 21-year old Bryan Barnes, one of two men charged with the murder of two USC graduate students from China, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. According to the Los Angeles Times, Barnes will serve two consecutive life terms and will not be granted parole.
On April 11, 2012, Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot by Barnes, 20 years old at the time, while parked outside in a neighborhood near campus.
According to the L.A. Times, Wu’s black iPhone, which was stolen from the scene of the crime, linked Los Angeles police detectives to Barnes and his presumed accomplice, then 19-year old Javier Bolden. Bolden’s trial has yet to be held.
Prosecutors said during preliminary hearings that the GPS in Wu’s phone lead police to a warehouse and evidence implicated Barnes.
By court order, investigators were allowed to wiretap Barnes’ telephone conversations. According to the L.A. Times, in one call with Bolden, Barnes mentions how they “ran up on them little Asian people,” implying that he had shot them.
Additionally, a former girlfriend of Barnes testified that Barnes had admitted to stealing the cell phone, and told her that someone may have been shot during the robbery.
Judge Stephen A. Marcus, who presided over the trial, declared there was “more than enough evidence” in connecting Barnes and Bolden to the murders of Qu and Wu.
According to the L.A. Times, investigators also suspect Barnes and Bolden in another shooting in which a victim was hit eight times. Bolden is also being investigated in conjunction with a shooting that injured two people.
So where are the rows of supporters from Bryan Barnes party group. They had no problem coming out when he was arrested, protesting and yelling about his innocence. Were they in attendance holding signs and heckling the court? Hmmm, weird… I guess its easy to express outrage, but much harder to admit you were dead wrong in the first place… Where was the ghetto peanut gallery today?
RIP Qu and Wu. Sickening crime.
And where was Barnes statement on his crime? Or at least a description of his demeanor in the court. Was Bolden there and how did he react to things?
