USC students and faculty filed into Fertitta Hall to see producer Don Mischer speak as part of Business Communication Expert Speaker Series on Wednesday.
Mischer, the president of Don Mischer Productions, oversaw the production of the 83rd, 84th, and 85th Academy Awards. He has received the Governor’s Award from the National Association of Choreographers, and is a member of the Event Industry Hall of Fame, the Producers Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
Mischer focused on sharing his past experiences with the audience in order to give them advice on how to attain success in the live television industry and recounted countless challenging scenarios he has faced in his career. Mischer also answered various questions from the audience.
According to Mischer, while the television business may seem solely glamorous and well-calculated to many, he recalled several occasions where spontaneous events boosted television ratings. 
“So many times we worry and prep about something going wrong, but sometimes the unexpected can make a show more exciting and memorable,” Mischer said.
Mischer stressed the importance of communication in the television industry, specifically the live television industry.
 “Success and failures are more or less based on communication,” Mischer said, referring to events such as surprising the public with Muhammad Ali being the final American to hold the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1966. 
Mischer reminisced about events such as these, explaining the immense calculated secrecy and timing that allowed incidents such as these to have such a large impact on not only America, but on a global scale as well. 
“There’s no feeling like being in a control room where you’re looking at the clock and it’s going 10.. 9.. 8.. And you know that 80 percent of the planet will be watching what you’re about to lay out there,” Mischer said.
Mischer also touched on the importance of social media in the new world of television. 
“The landscape of television is changing rapidly,” said Mischer. “Social media has opened up new levels of communication… We had 78 percent of Oscar viewers have a second screen in their hand. .. You can greatly enhance communication with your potential audience.”
While the past and the present were heavily talked about, the Mischer answered questions regarding the future of television, stating that companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming websites are the future of television. Mischer also highlighted the tenacity needed for such a job. 
“I think we kind of thrive [on stress],” Mischer said. “We get some type of joy from it. There’s this type of game you play in your head, “can we pull it off?” and you leave the event thinking “we dodged a bullet.”
Mischer stressed the importance of live television bringing together a variety of communities in a variety of places.
 “Everyone is watching, it’s a group experience,” said Mischer. “More than anything, live television makes [people] feel like they’re seeing something real.”

USC’s long search for a new women’s basketball head coach ended on Friday, as Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced Mark Trakh would return after an eight-year absence to lead the Trojans.
“We are thrilled to welcome Mark back to USC,” Swann said.  “It was important for us to hire a coach who really wanted to be at USC, who truly cares about our student-athletes and who believes in the Trojan way of excelling.  We found that coach in Mark Trakh.  He has the experience and maturity to help our young team grow and develop.”
Photo from Twitter
Trakh, 61, previously coached USC for five seasons, from 2005 to 2009, guiding the Trojans to two NCAA Tournament berths and four Pac-12 Tournament semifinals (one final). The NCAA Tournament appearance in 2005, Trakh’s first season, was the program’s first in seven years, and USC progressed past the first round, losing on a last-second basket against top-seeded Michigan State in the Round of 32.
After departing USC in 2009 for personal reasons, Trakh spent two years away from basketball before coaching the past six years at New Mexico State, where he compiled a 104-80 record. The Aggies were 24-7 overall last season and boasted a perfect 14-0 record in conference play. They lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to eventual finalist Stanford.
“I’m excited to once again be a part of the great tradition at USC,” Trakh said. “I feel that there is a ton of potential in this team, and I look forward to start working with them.”
Trakh takes the place of former head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, who resigned last month after four years at USC. The Trojans finished 14-16 and lost to Cal in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament in Cooper-Dyke’s final season.
USC finished with a 15-14 record in Trakh’s final season, falling to Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship in the Trojans’ first-ever tournament final.
“The goal and expectation is always to get to the Final Four,” Trakh said. “I really want to reignite the tradition of excellence that we have at USC.  It all starts with recruiting and coaching up the women and helping them succeed.  I also look forward to coaching again in the Pac-12, which is filled with great teams and coaches and is really a conference of national contenders.”
Trakh’s arrival brings an end to an extended coaching search during which multiple candidates linked to USC took positions at different programs — some at rival Pac-12 schools.
“Mark is a great teacher of the game,” Swann said. “Players enjoy playing for him.  He is a very effective recruiter.  And he has a knack for taking teams to the NCAA Tournament, which we look for him to continue doing.”

Tucked away on the fourth floor of Taper Hall, Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen’s office is lined with shelves and shelves of books. For a longtime lover of literature and an English professor who has taught at USC for 20 years, the scene is not out of the ordinary — it is almost expected for a man who has dedicated his career to the written word.
Stacks of loose papers and up-ended novels create a wall between the center of his desk and the packed bookshelf, but Nguyen is not confined to classic literature in his line of work. For him, literature is alive — it is the embodiment of heritage, history, myth and culture and an inevitable product of his identity. 
In April 2016, Nguyen’s debut novel The Sympathizer was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction — a momentous event that shifted the trajectory of his writing career. 
But beyond the awards and accolades, Nguyen is, at his core, a storyteller, a believer in the power of stories and how they philosophically change and enlighten people’s lives.
“My teaching is not only analytical,” Nguyen said. “I think about the larger frame of my semester: What kind of story am I trying to tell students every day when I come in to lecture, to lead discussion?”
Nguyen’s path as a writer inextricably intertwines with his work as a professor and scholar. Fresh out of a doctoral program at 26, Nguyen received a USC assistant professorship — a position that allowed him to pursue both fiction writing and academia — and has not left to teach elsewhere since.
“I’ve grown as a professor here by learning how to tell stories,” Nguyen said, reflecting on his academic tenure. “That came from writing fiction. I know that people respond to stories, including students.” 
Nguyen has his own story — one that kindles his passion and dedication to his Vietnamese heritage. It’s a story he holds at the heart of his classes, academic research and published novels. At four years old, Nguyen was a refugee. Although he escaped the aftermath of the Vietnam War, he soon faced a war with his own identity as a Vietnamese American.
“The stories and art I encountered about the Vietnam War had nothing good to say about Vietnamese people of any background,” Nguyen said. “At that point, I realized that these stories are very important because they tell us about who we are.” 
Nguyen’s story and struggle of cultural duality is not unique among Vietnamese Americans — generation after generation of immigrants, refugees and social newcomers to American society face these challenges.
“I wanted to write stories that would contest the American stories of the Vietnam War,” Nguyen said. “We as Vietnamese refugees are people considered [to those in Vietnam] as traitors, losers, dissidents. It’s a struggle to make our presence and our memory heard and felt.” 
Nguyen’s general education course on the Vietnam War is dubbed his personal passion project — it’s a course on the persistence of war memories and ultimately helped him write his second book, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War. But for Nguyen, passion, however important it may be, was not the key to a Pulitzer or to the fulfillment of his craft.
It was work and required the will to sit in a chair for thousands of hours, dedicating his life to the art of storytelling.
“It took me 18 years of struggle and pain of writing constantly and continually, of experiencing rejection and obscurity before I got to write The Sympathizer in two years,” Nguyen said. “What I’ve learned is that in terms of writing, it’s the art, the discipline that matters.” 
Nguyen was compelled to write he intends not only to tell a meaningful story, but also to foster social, political and cultural messages. 
“It’s an important task to be a writer,” Nguyen said. 
And in retrospect, he realized his calling to the craft at a young age. When he was in elementary school, Nguyen wrote his first award-winning book, an achievement granted by his local public library. He was a voracious reader and writer, but his literary discoveries led to internal conflicts he struggled to flesh out in the course of his writing career.
He was, like his protagonist in The Sympathizer, a man of two faces. Nguyen knew he was ideologically different from his parents by the time he was 10, and he struggled to reconcile with them.
“The emotional part of me that I tapped into writing The Sympathizer is autobiographical,” Nguyen said. “Writers have to go where it hurts in order to tap into that emotion that has made you who you are.” 
Nguyen is not a man of tradition — he did not seek affirmation from the Vietnamese American community in his work. He acknowledges the vehemence in the emotions of many Vietnamese refugees about the Communist regime and its current existence. Nevertheless, he felt justified in having a Communist spy as his protagonist in The Sympathizer.
“I wanted to offend everybody when I wrote the novel,” Nguyen said.
He sought to disturb and question the deep-seated beliefs of Americans and Vietnamese people on the Vietnam War, just as he was disturbed by the duality of his identity. 
“As a refugee in San Jose, I was always feeling out of place — that I was a spy in my parents’ household, an American looking at these strange Vietnamese people and their customs,” Nguyen said. “When I stepped out into the rest of American society, I was a Vietnamese person spying on Americans.” 
The Sympathizer was emotionally liberating — Nguyen wrote the book for himself, placing his emotions into the heart and soul of his protagonist. But his following releases, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War and The Refugees, likewise hold similar emotional bearings. 
Although the Pulitzer Prize has skyrocketed his rise to fame, Nguyen’s life, albeit much busier, remains the same. 
Nguyen is both a writer and a professor, but his careers are the two sides of the same coin. On one side, he is a teacher, seeking to prod and provoke students into understanding the multifaceted perspectives of Asian American literature and the Vietnam War. On the other, he exists as a bold voice for the Vietnamese American community, with each book presenting the depth and complexity of not only Vietnamese culture, but also human nature.

When the USC administration raised next year’s tuition by $2,006, Emily Wan heard all the reasons for this change. Wan, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, understood that the University needed to pay for increased student services and fund a large financial aid pool, all explanations Provost Michael Quick gave in a press release on March 1. But for Wan, the increase still caused financial difficulties.
“There is a large portion of us who do not receive financial aid,” Wan said. “Of that large portion, a lot of us do not have the means of paying for it all [tuition]. A lot of us are not rich enough, wealthy enough to pay for the entire amount.”
Although USC’s tuition increases are at a five-year average low, the anticipated 3.9 percent increase for the 2017-2018 school year is slightly higher than the average increases of 22 comparable universities across the nation. A Daily Trojan survey found that for the upcoming school year, the average increase in tuition at the universities will be 3.70 percent.
These data indicate that USC’s increase is not unusual among its peer universities, and as a statement from the University pointed out, tuition only covers 78 percent of undergraduate education costs. But despite the use of this increase to fund student and academic services, in addition to instruction expenses, many students are still hit hard by higher costs and a lack of aid.
Funding financial aid
Data from college websites Jenny Chung and Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
According to the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, published in-state tuition and fees between 2006 and 2017 at public four-year institutions increased at an average rate of 3.5 percent per year beyond inflation. During the same time period, average published tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year colleges rose by an average of 2.4 percent per year. 
USC’s increase is higher than the College Board’s findings and the average of the 22 universities surveyed. 
According to the University, this increase is due to rising costs for technology, salaries and academic services. 
“Along with most universities, our costs related to educating students increase every year,” the University said in a statement sent to the Daily Trojan on April 20. “Among those costs are instruction expenses — including faculty salaries and benefits — student services, and academic support. And even with the increases, undergraduate student tuition still does not cover the full costs of education.”
In the March 1 press release, Quick stated that USC also hopes to mitigate costs for students through a large financial aid pool. The Financial Aid Office could not be reached to confirm whether increasing financial aid opportunities was the direct reason for the tuition hike. But although USC spent $528 million on financial aid in the last year, and over half of all students receive some form of financial assistance, many students still struggle to pay their expected family contribution every year. 
Struggling students
Some students have even been forced to consider dropping out of school or taking a break from college because of USC’s steep price tag. 
That’s exactly what sophomore architecture major Steven Montoya had to do last semester after his family members realized they could not afford what the University expected them to pay. 
 “After the financial aid package had been applied for my first year, I only had to pay about $2,000, but it turns out that amount is very hard to deal with for my family,” Montoya said. “It came to a point where having to pay that amount was too difficult, so I had to declare a leave of absence last semester.” 
Montoya declared the leave of absence as a last-resort option.
“I didn’t [appeal the financial aid award] because I felt like I had done everything I could to help mitigate the costs,” Montoya said. “I feel like if I had asked them again, they would probably say something under the lines of, ‘You should consider private loans,’ which I definitely don’t want to do because of the interest rates being higher and because they don’t have the flexibility of paying them back like the federal loans do.” 
Montoya, who is switching from the five-year architecture program at USC to the four-year program, hopes that next year’s tuition increase does not put him in the position where he must take another leave of absence and further postpone his graduation. 
“With this recent financial aid increase, I guess it’s going to be a little harder for me,” Montoya said. “I really don’t want to have to  [take a leave of absence] again. It interrupts your whole academic path. Even though I am switching over to the four-year program, I know I am still going to graduate with the rest of the five-years. You have a certain pathway you’re going down, and with that leave of absence, you’re just like side-winded.” 
The absence of aid
Even though Wan is in a different financial position than Montoya, she is also concerned about USC’s tuition increase for the 2017-2018 school year, because she has taken out loans to pay for her education. 
“I do not receive any financial aid from the school, nor do I receive any federal work-study or anything of the sort,” Wan said. “So the only money that I’m getting is loans that I’ve applied for and gotten and will be paying off for many years. Just because I do not receive any financial aid does not mean I can afford to pay the entirety of the tuition.” 
Wan represents the portion of students at USC who are not affected by the University’s goal of mitigating tuition costs with financial aid.
“I am taking out a lot of loans, and by Nikias or the administration raising the tuition prices, they are basically just forcing me to pay more,” Wan said. 
Although Montoya and Wan are in different financial situations, they both agree that the University’s financial aid system can do more for students and their families. 
“The best thing for [financial aid] to do is to really be very sensitive to what families are going through,” Montoya said. “Every family, when they apply for financial aid, [is] going through hardships sometimes. You know, not everyone has the same income levels or the same degree of privilege.”

At three years old, Ana Mercado immigrated with her family to the United States from Mexico.
Now a sophomore majoring in contemporary Latino and Latin American studies and sociology, Mercado has been unable to return to her home country because of her undocumented, or DREAMer, status.
As the first in her family to attend a university, she is hoping to pave the way for her four younger siblings. This year’s executive orders affecting deportations and ICE raids, however, left Mercado feeling anxious. 
“We’re not only battling with the day-to-day college life, but we’re also dealing with other stressors like how our status affects us,” Mercado said. “It’s extremely stressful. You have deadlines to meet for school, but then you’re also trying to figure out the application process. It’s crazy.” 
One organization on campus has helped ease some of those tensions and make Mercado feel as though she isn’t alone. 
The Legal Advice Project, a new initiative by the USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic, is a provost-funded project which provides free legal consultations and referrals to members of the student body, faculty and staff who are seeking naturalization, want to know their rights or are either at risk of deportation or have family members at risk.
The Legal Advice Project has given Mercado free assistance  in renewing her visa. 
She explained how drastically the project has helped her through her first time undergoing the documentation process. 
“The process was super fast, the staff is just so helpful,” Mercado said. “Throughout the whole process, they were there, they were helping me out. There was just a lot of uncertainty, so I didn’t know who to go to and who actually to trust, but knowing that they were walking with me through that process was extremely helpful.” 
Jean Reisz, an Audrey Irmas Clinical Teaching Fellow and member of the Legal Advice Project team, said that this guidance and presentation of credible information is a principal goal of the organization. 
“In these kind of scary and very anxious times, it’s really important that people feel supported and that they can get information that’s reliable … because there’s also a lot of bad information out there that increases the anxiety,” Reisz said. 
Since the project began days after the 2016 presidential election, the team of four has worked with over 50 faculty members, staff and students like Mercado.
Through informational sessions, media, leaflets, collaboration with cultural and religious centers and tables at events, the Immigration Clinic hopes to further engage with the student body.
Niels Frenzen, director of the USC Gould Immigration Clinic and head of the Legal Advice Project, hopes that through this engagement, the project will make students feel further supported on campus. 
“Our international students, our immigrant students, documented and undocumented, are all very much being threatened right now with hate, with increased immigration enforcement policies, and it’s very important for USC to use its position in the country and the world to respond to that,” Frenzen said. “Part of that is in taking care of our own in some way and that is something that this particular project is going to be able to do at least in terms of legal issues.”
As much as I dislike Ucla, I couldn’t care any less for USC, anymore. As a Viterbi alum, I just follow the football and that’s it. 
USC is trying so hard to jump on the SJW bandwagon. If “academic prestige” and “intellectualism” are intertwined with SJWism, then the hell with higher learning. If I have children, I will nurture them to pursue STEM majors, like yours truly, and, at a neutral institute like Caltech or MIT. These schools for the most part are neutral. Sure some people from there make a fuss over politics and current events, but usually they are tacit.

With the MPSF regular-season title and conference tournament seeds on the line during the final week of the regular season, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team (26-1 overall, 4-1 MPSF) will look to have a big showing this weekend when they take on crosstown rival and No. 1 UCLA (19-1, 5-0) in Westwood on Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Spieker Aquatics Center.
With USC, UCLA and Stanford all jockeying for position to claim the top seed heading into next week’s MPSF tournament, each game leading up to the event will be crucial and near must-wins for the Trojans. However, senior captain Avery Peterson and her teammates are no strangers to the high stakes and pressure that accumulate this time of the year.
“We’ve all been really excited for these kinds of matches,” Peterson said. “The month of April has all of the big games that we like to play in before we head into the MPSF and NCAA tournaments, so there’s kind of a different feel to it now. We’re excited, but we also know we need to be extra focused and even more prepared than before.”
The preparation and focus needed to sustain a high level of play in the latter half of the season is not lost on senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis. 
“It’s going to be about taking things one game at a time,” Haralabidis said. “We’re preparing ourselves for those big tournaments at the end of the season, yes, but before all of that, we can’t overlook the game in front of us.”
A tough loss by four goals against Stanford earlier this month has put USC in somewhat of a tricky position to nab the top seed in the MPSF Tournament, as a few scenarios would have to play out in the Trojans’ favor for that to happen. If USC can defeat UCLA by at least eight goals on Saturday, or win against UCLA (regardless of the score) and have Stanford — which is tied with USC for No. 2 — lose to No. 15 San Jose State, then the Trojans will steal the first seed. A win by seven goals or less against UCLA would give the Trojans the second seed, while a loss puts USC in third.
However, USC is the only team to have beaten UCLA this season — a 10-9 decision in the semifinals of the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in Irvine back in late February. In that game, the Trojans erased an early deficit thanks to two goals each from senior driver Stephania Haralabidis, junior utility Hayley McKelvey, and freshman utility Maud Megens. Sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan also recorded 12 saves in that win, pushing USC into the finals of the non-conference tournament. 
In fact, USC has won the last four meetings against UCLA, with their last loss coming in the 2015 MPSF Tournament semifinals. The Bruins are riding a nine-game win streak into Saturday’s matchup, though, having just upset top-ranked Stanford in Palo Alto last weekend. UCLA then leapfrogged Stanford and USC in the rankings to stand as the No. 1 team in the nation and remain the only unbeaten team in the MPSF. 
Though the stakes are now raised, Haralabidis and the Trojans will be ready for a battle come Saturday.
“I think we are prepared,” Haralabidis said. “What [head coach Jovan Vavic] tells us all the time is true: Preparation gives us confidence before the game, so we just need to study our opponents, get back to the basics and play our team game.”
The big crosstown splashdown between the nation’s No. 1 and No. 2 teams is set for 1 p.m. at the Spieker Aquatics Center and will be broadcast live on Pac-12 Los Angeles. Furthermore, the upcoming 2017 MPSF Women’s Water Polo Championship Tournament will also be held in Westwood on April 28-30.

On Wednesday morning, the sports world woke up to the shocking news that former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez committed suicide by hanging himself in his Massachusetts prison cell.
Hernandez was serving a life sentence for murdering Odin Lloyd in 2013, but just days before his death, he had been acquitted of a double murder in a separate incident. All of this compacts a bewildering end to a bewildering career: an NFL star who seemingly had it all suddenly sitting in a jail cell for life, and ultimately killing himself via a bedsheet attached to a cell window.
We’ve seen sports stars end their own lives in tragic ways in the past. Len Bias overdosed on cocaine and died two days after being selected second overall in the 1986 NBA Draft. Last year, Miami Marlins ace Jose Fernandez died in a boating accident — he was later found to be legally drunk and with cocaine in his system.
But those were unfortunate, one-off situations. Hernandez was completely different. He was a cold-blooded killer and a convicted felon, a man whose once-promising athletic career spiraled into the depths of despair in a manner like we’ve never seen before.
To look at the spiral is unsettling. He made his name at the University of Florida, playing alongside Tim Tebow and winning the John Mackey Award for Most Outstanding Tight End in 2009. Selected by the Patriots in the fourth round of the NFL Draft in 2010, Hernandez soon found himself catching touchdown passes from Tom Brady and playing in Super Bowls, living the NFL dream.
Everything seemed perfect. In 2012, Hernandez signed a contract extension worth $41 million — $50,000 of which he immediately donated to charity. He had a girlfriend, a young child and a multi-million dollar home in the Boston suburbs. From the outside, Hernandez’s life was commendable.
It was anything but that, however. Hernandez lived a double life. He hung out with the wrong people, was rumored to be affiliated with gangs and held grudges that ended violently.
In July 2012, a month before Hernandez signed his contract extension, a drive-by shooting occurred in South Boston when the occupants of an SUV pulled up to a BMW on an overpass and killed the two men, Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado inside. 
Prosecutors said it was Hernandez who pulled the trigger. A year later, Hernandez shot and killed Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who Hernandez befriended two years prior after meeting through family friends.
The Patriots released him immediately. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. And like that, the once-seemingly perfect life had spiraled into an unimaginable horror story.
Daniel de Abreu is dead. Safiro Furtado is dead. Odin Lloyd. And now, Aaron Hernandez, too. All of this was completely unnecessary. All of this has us asking, “Why?”
It made no sense for Hernandez, whose football career was set up for him on a tee — successful college career, drafted by a top-notch franchise in New England — to go down this path.
It made no sense for a star athlete with a family and a picturesque suburban home to revert to settling scores and throwing away his career by firing bullets. And it made no sense for Hernandez, days after being acquitted of de Abreu and Furtado’s murders, to hang himself with a bedsheet in his prison cell, even jamming the door from the inside to stall the prison guards from potentially stopping him. What could ever drive an athlete who had so much to give it all away?
Eight days ago, Hernandez was beaming in the courtroom before his acquittal at the sight of his fiancee and four-year-old daughter, Avielle. He had a big smile on his face and blew kisses at Avielle as he was led away, according to The Boston Globe.
Less than a week later, Hernandez was dead. He’d leave behind a fiancee, a daughter who will grow up without a father and no closure for anyone — not his family, not the families of his three alleged victims and not anyone who has followed this inexplicable saga.
 This, indeed, was a saga unlike any other, at least in sports. Bias didn’t mean to overdose on cocaine and end his life before even stepping foot on an NBA court. Fernandez didn’t mean to crash his boat that night and cut short a lengthy baseball career. 
But Aaron Hernandez chose this. He chose to murder. He chose to throw away his life and his promising future in the NFL so he could settle a few scores.
And the unfortunate thing is, we will never know why.

This weekend, the women’s lacrosse team rounds out the regular season with two MPSF contests in Northern California, battling Stanford on Friday and UC Davis on Sunday.
The No. 8 Trojans are currently on a six-game winning streak and hold a 12-3 record heading into the weekend as they look to continue their winning ways against their Northern California opponents.
With 16 straight regular season MPSF victories under their belts, the Trojans are approaching the MPSF record of 18 straight conference wins. Friday’s matchup presents a crucial opportunity for USC to clinch a No. 1 seed and first round bye in the upcoming MPSF tournament, which takes place from April 27-30.
“We’re looking at it as another opportunity,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “We need to be ready to play. They’re a phenomenal team and very well-coached. It’s a clean slate — we need to be ready to take care of business for a full 60 minutes.” 
The Trojan team is anchored by two-time All-American senior attacker Michaela Michael, who has recorded 54 goals and 16 assists so far this season. 
“She’s been a tremendous player for us for four years,” Munday said. “She wants to do everything she can to help this team to be successful whether it’s scoring goals, assisting or setting people up.” 
She is accompanied on offense by fellow seniors Kylie Drexel with 24 goals, Gabby McMahon with 25 goals and Cynthia Del Core with 28 goals this season. Freshman Kerrigan Miller also has proven to be a strong asset to the Trojan roster, scoring five hat tricks in her first season with the Trojans.
The USC defensive line features senior Nina Kelty, who has notched 21 ground balls this season and junior Lydia Sutton who boasts 28 ground balls of her own.
Stanford, which holds a 10-4 overall record, seeks to continue their three-game winning streak after struggling against Yale and Colorado earlier in the season. The Cardinal leads the league in shots with an average of 33.29 per game. Their roster also features the league’s leading scorer, Kelsey Murray, who records an average of 4.71 points per game. Allie DaCar anchors the Cardinal defense in goal with a 10.73 goals against average, ranking third in the league.
“They returned a lot of their offense from last year, so defensively we have to be ready to play a really disciplined game and stick to the basics of what we’ve been doing all year with everyone doing their part and playing simple,” Munday said. 
On Sunday, the Trojans will face UC Davis, which holds a 6-9 overall record with a 2-4 MPSF record. The Aggies mark third best in the league for both assists and ground balls. On defense, Taylor Cuenin leads the league in caused turnovers, averaging 3.77 per game.
Having already clinched a spot in the MPSF tournament for the fifth consecutive time, the Trojans look to take it one game at a time with their sights set on securing a No. 1 seed if they can pull out a victory on Friday.
In just a short five years, the Trojans have created a strong legacy, earning a spot in the MPSF tournament each year since the birth of the program. 
“We’re really thankful that we have great kids on board that have bought into the values of the program from day one,” Munday said. “It’s always been about continuing to get better, supporting each other, working hard and having fun on the way. It’s a testament to the girls that we have on board and the players that have graduated.”

The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books won’t just feature prominent authors and poets. Many USC students and alumni will also be in the spotlight, performing their own songs or playing their instruments at the event. Here are some performers set to take the stage this weekend.
Anna Dellaria
A senior majoring in popular music performance, Anna Dellaria writes and performs her own songs, which focus on the pop and R&B genres. She has performed with artists such as Chaka Khan, John Fogerty and Lamont Dozier and worked with industry greats such as Patrice Rushen and Romeo Johnson. 
Dellaria is passionate about the way music can serve as a unifying force as well as a mode of expression for human emotion, and she  hopes that her music will have a positive impact on others. 
“Music is a universal language,” Dellaria said. “It transcends all boundaries of time, era, genre [and] location and allows us as humans to connect. I want to be able to be a part of music and its impact on the world. I want to be able to make a difference.” 
After a short period of laying low, Dellaria is back and better than ever, with new songs and new collaborative content, as well as several scheduled shows. 
“I will be performing a lot and I am in the process of actually releasing new music,” Dellaria said. “I’m excited to share these songs that I’ve recorded and to keep working with the amazing producers on future songs.” 
J.VEN
Javen Smith, who performs under the name J.VEN, is a singer and songwriter specializing in pop and R&B. After briefly attending the NYU Tisch School of the Arts as an acting major, he transferred to the USC Thornton School of Music as a senior majoring in popular music.
Smith was raised in a series of foster care homes and had to overcome struggles in order to get his music career off the ground. Smith was able to persevere and succeed despite his early hardships. 
“As a foster care student, I don’t really know anyone here,” Smith said. “I don’t have a lot of connections. Also, it’s expensive to make and promote music. Finding the capital to create the music has always been a large struggle.” 
Performing at the Festival of Books will be an honor for Smith, who, ever since witnessing older students in the popular music program performing at the festival, had aspired to do the same. 
“When I was a freshman here at USC, I saw some of the seniors performing [at the Festival of Books] and I thought that was such a milestone,” Smith said. “I wanted to perform there as well before I left.”
Thumpasaurus 
Thumpasaurus is a high-energy funk band that dabbles in
several different genres, such as funk, dance, punk, blues and rock and roll. The band is comprised of Lucas Tamaren on guitar and vocals, Henry Solomon on saxophone, Paul Cornish on keys, Logan Kane on bass and Henry Was on drums and production.
Lucas Tamaren, a freelance musician and composer and lead guitar and singer of the band, said that the band developed organically after the members met and studied together at Thornton. 
“We started out of USC,” Tamaren said. “The band mostly includes USC jazz students, three of whom are currently still in school. We met together through mutual friends, started playing house parties, and then it naturally grew.” 
Tamaren hoped that Thumpasaurus would turn into a full-fledged gig in the future, allowing the members to forge a future out of their passion for music. 
“We all love playing together,” Tamaren said. “We want to see where we can take Thumpasaurus creatively and see if it sticks with people. Do it as both our passion and our career.”
Trio Ellas 
Trio Ellas is composed of Thornton alumna Suemy Gonzalez  on violin and vocals, a graduate of Thornton, Nelly Cortez on guitarron and vocals and Stephanie Amaro on guitar and vocals. Their unique sound stems from traditional mariachi roots infused with a variety of different genres inspired by the eclectic L.A. music scene. 
The trio’s debut album Con Ustedes was nominated for a 2012 Latin Grammy. The trio has recorded for artists such as Benjamin Gibbard and Lady Gaga, and performed live with several top artists including Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan and Mariachi El Bronx.
The SoCal VoCals
Founded in 1996, The SoCal VoCals is the first of nine a cappella groups at USC. Comprised of a select group of students, the group arranges and sing songs from multiple genres, including pop, rock and jazz. 
The group has released seven albums so far. In the past, it has performed at prestigious venues such as the Staples Center, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Getty Center, Rose Bowl, Los Angeles House of Blues and Hollywood Bowl. The SoCal VoCals is known for its engaging performance style and school spirit. 
Spirit of Troy
The USC Trojan Marching Band, nicknamed the Spirit of Troy, was founded in 1880 and features over 300 students. The Spirit of Troy represents USC at various collegiate sports, broadcast, popular music recording and national public appearance functions and is an iconic symbol of the university. A contingent of the band has not missed a single Trojan football game, home and away, since 1987. It was named “Best Band in College Football” by USA Today in 2014.

This weekend, the USC School of Dramatic Arts will present the German play Spring Awakening. Often censored, Spring Awakening tells the story of a group of teenagers and their subsequent sexual awakenings. First performed in the early 20th century, Frank Wedekind’s play holds truth today in a world in which sex is omnipresent throughout media and is constantly discussed.
Taking place in Germany during the mid-1890s, the play follows the lives of teenagers experiencing their sexual awakenings while coming of age. The play does not shy away from sensitive topics — masturbation, sexual attraction and rape — and because of it, Spring Awakening was often banned in its early productions out of the fear of being “taboo” or too inappropriate for audiences. Yet today, when sexuality plays such a big role in society, Spring Awakening can be the necessary reminder that audiences need to have serious discussions around sexuality and its complexity.
“The play is about sexuality and how it can be the crux of our expression of identity, but there are just so many different ways of desiring things,” said Laura Flanagan, an assistant professor of theatre practice and director of Spring Awakening. “For example, the main character could be understood [as] going through gender confusion in today’s culture.” 
Today, more people accept that sexuality is fluid, yet there were hints of this knowledge during Wedekind’s time. An Austrian-German psychiatrist, Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing sought to better understand sexual behavior in the late 1880s in his book Psychopathia Sexualis. Works like Krafft-Ebing’s helped shape Spring Awakening’s plot. 
“The play doesn’t represent sexual deviancy as deviant, but rather, as ways people desire other people,” Flanagan said. “It leaves sexuality open, much like in Krafft-Ebing’s work, which is why it is so crazy Spring Awakening was written back then, and why it’s still so crazy now.”
Throughout history, people have struggled to grapple with the concept of sexuality — and sexual identity remains an elusive concept even today. Not every aspect of sexuality can be accepted by the public, and certain actions can lead to certain consequences. Exploring one’s sexuality with different genders can be beneficial. However, actions like rape cannot be justified. Spring Awakening, in nature, does not make its answers very clear and thus leaves the audience debating the morality behind certain plot points. To make it even more complicated, the stress of the time period and the fact that the main characters are struggling adolescents makes the plot messy and gray in terms of right and wrong. 
“There’s an argument in the play to be made, that morality is relative — it’s a choice,” Flanagan said. “It’s an empty argument for us now. Morality is not imaginary — our actions have an innate effect on us and others. We’re trying to look at the play through that lens.”
The production consists of 15 students, who will each play one to three characters in the show. The set design, music and costuming was also completed by SDA students, making the play a student-run production at its core. Spring Awakening’s complexity and depth will transport viewers to Germany in the late 19th century and allow them to enjoy a more abstract, theatrical experience.
“[Spring Awakening] doesn’t really adhere to the rules of time and space entirely,” Flanagan said. “There are elements in it that seem farcical, and there are elements that are very realistic. It’s a very mysterious piece of writing, and it’s why I think it’s so powerful and potent.”
The show had its first showing on Thursday in the McClintock Theatre and will continue running throughout the weekend. More information regarding showtimes can be found online.

This has been my happiest semester at USC. In February, when my boyfriend broke up with me, my ovaries weren’t working. When my eating disorder relapsed and my anxiety was peaking, I wouldn’t have imagined this. But I look at the pictures on my bedroom wall — I’ve redecorated heavily since Jake slept in it at least three times a week — and I see a collage of incredible happiness and fulfillment and growth. 
There’s a poster on my wall that says, “Let’s cozy up.” It used to hang above my bed. When Jake left me, I put a Valentine my roommate gave me on top of it. The construction paper and glitter glue watched me as I slept instead. Recently, I took the entire poster down. I needed an empty wall with all the Skype interviews I’ve been doing.
My room is a representation of my evolution, but there’s something much deeper that I’ve been celebrating this semester. My mental health is better than it has ever been since I have gained a better understanding of what mental health is.
I have been going to therapy every week for almost a year. Before that, I went on and off, but had a purging and restricting eating disorder that long went untreated. Last summer, I started nutrition classes, and have been coupling that with therapy for almost a year as well. From June to August, I was on a meal plan and kept a food log that my doctor watched over. In September, my new nutritionist in Los Angeles asked me to do the same thing, but on paper rather than an app, and I cried myself to sleep in my bed trying to write that I ate some ice cream. Now I’m on antidepressants and only go to therapy and nutrition once a month. I’m about to be fully recovered. 
When I was fully recovered from cancer, I got 370 likes on my profile picture. I received letters and hugs in the immediate aftermath. But I lost myself on the road after that. When I came back to USC, I tried to have all my friends over for a party as a celebration, but only nine people showed up. 
When I had cancer, I couldn’t walk up a flight of stairs or read a book. I couldn’t touch a doorknob for fear of getting an infection. The one time I took a flight during my illness I wore a facial mask, gloves and rode a wheelchair. Back at USC in the fall of 2015, I couldn’t sit through a test or memorize my lines for the play I was in. I got a stress fracture because my body wasn’t used to walking anymore. And I threw up everything I ate. 
Because my body made itself sick, I thought my body was unforgivable. Because my mind got sick after that, I thought my mind was unforgivable.
But everyone thought I was OK again, so I tried to convince myself that was the case. Now, it’s finally true.
And despite amazing friends, some lovely partners and the constant, unwavering support of my parents, I did this myself. I excitedly told my friend recently that my eating disorder was almost gone, and she asked if I thought it was because time faded it away. I told her no. This took really hard work.
Having a positive relationship with myself has been arduous. Cancer was lonely due to the physical isolation. Mental health recovery has been lonely for other reasons. Every week, I take an Uber alone to Santa Monica and I talk about things I’ve never told anyone. Before September, I never knew I’d been abused. In December, I fought that unshakable memory as more flooded in. Now I can tell others what I’ve been through without thinking it impacts my identity.
I wish I felt as comfortable posting that I’m free of an eating disorder as I was posting about being free of cancer. I do wish more people I know could celebrate overcoming this with me, but for now, because of the stigma and my own discomfort, I will be content celebrating this for myself.
I don’t know what will come next for me in my other relationships. Come June, my friends are moving everywhere, from Berkeley to Burma. I have been seeing someone for two months who I quite like, but I’ll be away this summer. I can be comfortable with those uncertainties because I am so certain about myself. It feels beautiful to be able to sit on a bench in the middle of campus and eat a sandwich. It’s incredible to eat with friends and not constantly check everyone’s plate. 
Last summer, my therapist looked me in the eyes and asked me if I wanted to get better. She gave me the choice to walk out of her room and never come back. When I left that week, I seriously considered it. I felt at home with my two-page list of rules and couldn’t stand the idea of giving up that comfort. But when I went out for a drink and bar snacks with my friends later that week, and had to leave because of the pressure of the shortened menu, I knew I wanted to give up the bad thoughts that were controlling me. 
All the work since then has given me an incredible semester. And I’m so grateful.

At Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting, Treasurer Donielle Bunyard presented the 2017-2018 budget — one that allocates over $2 million in total to USG branches and programs. Among the typical distribution for programming, communication and cabinet salaries, one change stands out: the defunding of the Volunteer Center and the LEAD program. Next year, these programs — which provide a direct link between USC students and the surrounding community — would be defunded completely if the budget is passed at next week’s Senate meeting. This means they will lose over $92,000 in funds from USG, and it is unclear whether they will receive support from any other source.
As a university located near the heart of downtown Los Angeles, USC has a critical role to promote volunteering and encourage students to engage in opportunities for public service, community involvement and leadership development. The proposed budget, which primarily affects the Student Affairs Programing Department, reflects shifting priorities that could potentially inhibit USC’s service culture and its dedication to cultivating and inspiring service among students. 
At Tuesday’s meeting, Bunyard stated that USG believes it is more appropriate for Campus Activities and Student Affairs to cover the costs for the defunded programs. Historically, USG has funded these programs, and last year, the Volunteer Center received $13,250 more in funding while the LEAD program was cut by only $1,000. But Student Affairs has not confirmed whether it will be picking up the tab, and if these programs are left without support, the likely result is a massive scale back in major service opportunities for all students. 
The Volunteer Center programs provide signature service opportunities, from the Friends & Neighbors Day to Alternative Breaks that provide valuable benefits for the South Los Angeles community. Furthermore, LEAD provides students with impactful leadership retreats and mentorship resources. 
If funding for these programs is slashed, it’s important to look at the distribution of the newly available funds. The budget indicates that the $92,250 would be divided among other branches of student government. Most assemblies and committees will receive more funding, including $11,000 more for the Speakers Committee and $5,000 more for the Academic Culture Assembly. Furthermore, the Executive Cabinet expects $14,170 more for development, and staff salaries will increase by $6,475. Notably, Concerts Committee’s budget will increase by $25,000 — an odd reward for a group that butchered USG’s most-publicized signature event in the spring semester. 
The question remains whether increases in other budgets could justify the cuts made to the Volunteer Center. Perhaps groups like the Concerts Committee warrant increased funding to improve security for upcoming events. There’s no doubt that assemblies that received more funding — such as the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, International Student Assembly, Latina/o Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and others — would put the money to good use in serving their respective communities. 
However, this does not discount the issues potentially raised by the full defunding of the Volunteer Center. The Student Affairs volunteer programs are all-inclusive, meaning these funds are available for use by all students, unlike the assemblies — which are helpful, but focus solely on specific niche groups. It’s also important to note that the full $92,250 cut does not add up to the increases for these assemblies. 
Even if the defunded programs could actually procure more money from other sources, it is unclear how much this would entail. If even some funds come up short, the funding of one program, such as LEAD, may alternatively reduce funds for another, such as Friends & Neighbors. This could also lead to rising costs for Alternative Breaks — whereas before students could receive financial support to fund their travels, in the future the money could all come out of students’ pockets. This could prevent lower-income USC students from participating in these meaningful programs. 
USG cannot afford to take this risk. Volunteering and service are central to the Trojan identity. Students have an obligation to engage with their community, their world and themselves, and the Volunteer Center paves the way for them to do just that.  Programs such as Friends & Neighbors are crucial for acquainting new students with the local neighborhood and ingraining in them a commitment to service that can last for the rest of their lives.  Alternative Breaks immerse students in a wide variety of social issues, from homelessness in New York City to environmental degradation around the globe. And leadership conferences develop USC’s new generation of thinkers and doers, enhancing the student experience for everyone. 
If the Volunteer Center and LEAD programs are defunded by next semester, it will be a tragic loss for the student community. USG wants to maximize the student experience, but these drastic changes would slash opportunities for students. The USG administration must not ignore the value of volunteer and service programs to the community and to the USC experience.

Compromise, in some ways, is the watchword of life. Everything in college is about compromise: trade-offs and opportunity costs, practicality and dreaming, long-term and short-term goals and gratification and aggravation. It’s the cornerstone and design of politics, in theory. Pluralism. We found hope in the idea that more statesmen would occupy the aisle than stand on either side of it. 
Today, this semester’s installment of “Playing Politics” draws to a close. At the same time, I realize that my college experience is about to transition from being halfway begun to halfway over. The first days of freshman year felt like summer camp. These halls are old news now. Compromises have been made. We try to find the balance between preparing for the future and holding on to the time we have. 
It’s ironic for many of us — to be in the middle of an era of opportunity and youth at the same time  as this country is embroiled in such great fatigue. The stress of our horrifying national politics has affected us all. I remember walking to class the day after the election. People were in tears in the stairwells. We experienced mass mourning, the death of a dream. 
For a moment we thought our incredible youth and energy, the electricity of our global generation, had reached the top rung of the ladder, and all that passion would be reflected in a great historic event, the victory of our time. Instead, there’s horror, grief and betrayal. We were handed a half-wit administration of regressive, aggressive hatred, dysfunction, unbelievable irresponsibility, collusion and greed, conflict of interest and a contemptible dishonoring of the office and the nation. And then, to add insult to injury, young liberals betrayed themselves. 
Out from a ploy for moral superiority came the supplicant, embarrassing, altogether bleeding-heart harping to understand the Trumpian racists, to give the new administration a big, happy chance and sympathize with its suddenly forgettable misogyny and racism, to excuse its homophobia and ham-handed economic governance in the name of holding hands and smiling. We thought the way to stave off that feeling of bitter grief was, as with anything, to reach out. It was a crap deal. As we approach a new, bitter era of politics in which the majority has resolved to rule with the audacity of absolute monarchy (that one’s for you, Mitch McConnell) we get to learn a bitter, tired lesson. 
There are principles on which you cannot compromise. 
This column was originally going to be about compromise itself, the togetherness of politics — maybe if it were written during the summer-camp vibes of freshman naiveté. But I still often awaken to the horrifying sight of a CNN alert. It still stings to think about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and how little we deserved her efforts, her hope and her mind. 
I don’t hate President Donald Trump. When I think about him, I feel a surprising indifference. But I do detest everything he represents. Don’t buy into the baseless dream that hateful and nationalistic politics are legitimate, deserving or respectable. Those who practice them should, of course, have the unalienable right to believe in their ways and express them freely. But that doesn’t make them deserving of your compromise. When it comes to the politics of this new age, do not disparage your Democratic representatives for playing hardball. The protection of civil rights, economic prosperity and social progress is determined by the level of solidarity we maintain. Negotiating with nationalists will not make everything OK again. 
There is such a thing as objective truth. Transgender people are citizens who lawfully deserve equal rights. Gay marriage is legal and valid, a reality your personal mythology cannot change. The definition of murder is not negated by the victim’s race. Members of the Trump administration had contact with Russians. Climate change is a reality. Health care is a necessity. Higher education is a necessity. The new West Wing is understaffed, underprepared and mutinying. The United States is not “great” again; it is more vulnerable than ever. 
We will have to make many compromises throughout our lives. This isn’t one of them. As the summer approaches, I’ll leave you with one last thought — in an era of trial, struggle, disappointment and horror, do not, above all, forget your principles.

I found this to be a well-written column. (The ideas were certainly more literate and well-defended than the semi-intelligible ramblings of the other voice in the comment section as I write this — “so sad” indeed.) Best wishes to the budding columnist, wherever she ends up. I’m guessing that she has a good future in front of her.
Wow…this is girl brainwashed. My fist visit to this site-I hear all this stuff about liberal bias on campus and I don’t have to go far at all to find a shining example of it. So sad
