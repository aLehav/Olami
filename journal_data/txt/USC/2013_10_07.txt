Tim Wise, an author and anti-racism activist, led a discussion about race and privilege Monday night in Bovard Auditorium.
The event, called “White Like Me: An Honest Discussion About Race and Privilege,” was sponsored by the USC Latino Student Assembly in conjunction with El Centro Chicano, the Black Student Assembly and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly.
“We thought it would be interesting to have someone who is Caucasian talking about these issues, since it would usually be someone of color,” said Valerie Fernandez, executive director of the Latino Student Assembly.
Wise’s lecture informed students that issues of race should be spoken about more frequently and openly. He discussed how society should be unafraid to look at the systems in which we operate, and analyze how we tackle issues of race.
He placed responsibility to be aware of racism on all members of society, not just people of color. Wise explained the importance of being aware of the issues that people of color face, especially for Caucasian people.
“We’re not intentionally oppressive, but we are often oblivious to the experience of others and this is very dangerous,” he said.
Wise said fighting white supremacy is an issue all people should be concerned with. During the lecture, he spoke of his views regarding how continued racism is a prevalent issue today.
“When you fight white supremacy, you are not doing it to save people of color as a charity. If we don’t make change now, it will destroy our children and our grandchildren,” he said. “This is not charity, but rather self-help.”
Students appreciated the new perspective that Wise gave on issues of race through his experiences as a Caucasian male.
“He was able to talk about issues that are usually only addressed by black people. It really touched me that a person that is not my color skin is willing to help my cause,” said Levi Powell, the student affairs and diversity chair of BSA.
Having these discussions about race is only the first step, Wise said. He told audience members that everyone needs to take these conversations as an impetus for action.
Aneesha Gupta, a freshman majoring in computer science, said that Wise’s words opened her eyes to ways to take action to help defeat racism in society.
“The discussion was really interesting for me since I grew up in a primarily white area,” Gupta said. “The lecture was a nice reality check that these issues exist, and to hear the effects they have on people here,” she said.

I am appalled at the lack of Asians in the NFL…
This concern should have parity with people complaining about the lack of Blacks and Latinos in college, professional jobs, etc…
Guys like Time Wise have made a decent living for himself by perpetuating the myth racism is so rampant still in 2013.

A Los Angeles judge ruled on Monday that two men will stand trial for the murder of two USC graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, who were killed in an apparent robbery in April 2012.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephen A. Marcus said there was significant evidence connecting Bryan Barnes and Javier Bolden to the slaying for them to stand trial.
The Chinese international graduate students, both 23 years old, were shot dead while sitting in a parked BMW off campus near the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue.
Both students’ phones were stolen in the crime. Prosecutors said that Barnes sold one phone to a store and the other phone was found at the residence where he was arrested.
Barnes and Bolden will stand trial for first-degree murder and could face potential capital punishment. They were charged last May in connection with the case and pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in July.
Investigators on this case also connected Barnes and Bolden to another shooting, and Bolden to one more additional shooting. They will stand trial in connection to those crimes as well.
Qu and Wu’s parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the university seeking unspecified damages. The suit claims that the university misled them about the safety of the neighborhood surrounding campus. The case was dismissed in February for insufficient legal arguments.
Barnes’ and Bolden’s arraignment has been set for Nov. 7.

Very sad story.
Unfortunately, this is what happens when you venture away from USC’s Green Zone into the jungle of South Central.  It might as well be downtown Baghdad with all the blacks and other undesirables around here.  Adding more fences, more security cameras, and more security to the USC area is one thing that President Nikias is actually doing right.

Public venues provide the first-ever computer contact for over half of the people who go to them in eight different countries, according to a research seminar that the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted with the authors of the Global Impact Study of Public Access to Information & Computer Technologies.
Global perspective · Professor and research lead for the Global Impact Study Araba Sey discusses how access to technology can be a solution to developmental challenges on Monday at the Geoffery Cowan Forum. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Global Impact Study was a five-year comprehensive project that studied the scale, character and impacts of access to information communication and technologies in eight countries: Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Lithuania, the Philippines and South Africa.
“We took a hard look at the impact of public access to information technology,” said Francois Bar, associate professor of communication in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and chair of the study’s research working group. “Connected libraries, cyber cafes and public centers for a long time have been the main way in which people concerned with development tried to bring information technology access to developing countries. Recently, there has been a debate about whether this has been successful or not. Nobody had done an in-depth study to look at this before.”
Araba Sey, a research assistant professor at the University of Washington’s Information School and the research lead for the Global Impact Study, presented an overview of the report.
Sey noted that access to information technologies was seen as the solution to a wide range of developmental challenges.
“Individual access for most people was not likely to be achieved in a short amount of time,” she said. “Extensive investment was made to provide different public venues, such as community centers, libraries, etc.”
Sey noted that the most consistent finding in this study was that public access venues tended to be frequented not by the poor, marginalized population that they were targeting, but by people who were relatively educated with high incomes.
“The results themselves leave us with conflicting claims of public access — some say the venues have been successful while others say they haven’t,” Sey said. “This raises questions about whether or not public access actually does have an impact on development.”
The study found that although the majority of users were young, educated students with several years of computer experience, public venues still provided the first-ever computer contact for 50 percent of survey respondents and provided the first-ever Internet access for 62 percent of the respondents.
Several authors of the Global Impact Study Report also gave in-depth presentations on their specific areas of research.
Beth Kolko, professor of human centered design and engineering at the University of Washington and the principal investigator on the non-instrumental uses study, led a discussion on the value of using computers for personal or leisure reasons. This part of the study, conducted in Brazil, found that people who use the computer for leisure and personal reasons performed just as well on computer tasks as those who used the computer for instrumental uses, suggesting that informal training is important to developing computer skills.
“I am not familiar with how developing countries work but I learned a lot from the presentation,” said Sam Chan, a first-year graduate student in communication.

More than 500 students have signed a petition calling for the Office of Student Affairs to implement new rules regarding sexual violence and the way the university handles reports of such incidents.
The petition, created by Kaya Masler, a senior majoring in political science, was posted on Change.org and is titled, “The Office of Student Affairs at the University of Southern California: Please take these 9 easy steps to create a safer campus.”
The petition asks USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett and the school administration to create a resource guide for the USC community, clarify the alleged perpetrator accountability process and establish an anonymous reporting option for students who might not want to adjudicate their cases with the university, among other requests. Of the proposed reforms, four of the nine request more transparency so that students are able to see how the university responds to and reports complaints of sexual assault and harassment.
USC’s handling of sexual harassment and violence was brought to light again this past April after the Office for Civil Rights, a branch of the U.S. Department of Education, opened an investigation into USC and many other universities. After students at USC alleged an inadequate response to cases of sexual violence, the Office for Civil Rights looked into USC’s compliance with Title IX, a federal law that requires universities to protect students from sexual harassment and assault.
“This issue is not unique to USC, nor is it unique to higher education. This is the same discussion going on in the U.S. military, in corporate America, in many different venues about effective means for adjudicating and communicating, working with employers, cadets, students, to make sure issues dealing with sexual harassment and sexual assault are fairly addressed,” said Dr. Ainsley Carry, vice provost of student affairs.
Masler noted that more could be done to reveal information to the public about the process of responding to complaints of sexual assault.
“SJACS [Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards] keeps their process private and I understand part of that is for legal reasons but they could add just a simple flow-chart that this happens, then this happens, and you can expect to hear back in this amount of time, as is your right,” she said. “This is a simple administrative resource they can provide that they’re not providing.”
The online petition’s initial goal of 500 signatures, was reached on Monday. The new goal is 1,000 signatures. Masler said that reactions to the petition have been mostly favorable.
“I’ve received positive feedback about every line of the petition from USC administrators over the past year or so,” she said. “Everyone says that’s a great idea, but I don’t always get enough follow-through.”
Alex Kanegawa, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, was one student who signed the petition.
“It’s unfathomable to think that you wouldn’t have something like this in place,” Kanegawa said. “Signing the petition is a small step forward. There’s a lot more to be done, but it’s part of being the solution. I feel like this is something everyone should be really conscious about.”
In July, Provost Garrett sent a letter to the USC community that said USC would “collaborate fully” with the Office for Civil Rights and “look forward to suggestions they might have.” Many students, however, have fought for further action.
“Compliance should be automatic. Some of the reforms that are proposed on the petition go above and beyond compliance. USC claims to be a national leader in this, so one would expect that they would go above and beyond compliance,” said Francesa Bessey, a junior majoring in international relations.
Despite this, Bessey added that the USC administration has initiated some positive actions.
“Although I’m still not satisfied with their definition, small steps have been taken, which is wonderful,” Bessey said. “I hope that the university continues to take steps like this, but there’s a really, really long way to go.”
Other students believe that USC has already taken steps to improve procedures that handle sexual violence.
“I signed the petition and I really hope it’s implemented,” said Jasmine Zahedi, a freshman majoring in psychology. “But I think USC is taking the appropriate actions by cooperating with federal laws.”
Carry noted that his office has been working with student leadership.
“We went back and forth in a really good exchange of what I think were good ideas in [Masler’s] nine points. Some of those issues have already been in the works for multiple years,” he said. “I appreciate this conversation because it’s only going to help us get better. That has to be our focus: making sure we can get better.”
Through the recent petition, students advise that the university consider their proposals.
“Listening to student input is essential if you really want to tackle the issue appropriately,” Bessey said.

On Monday, a number of USC’s religious organizations, the USC Institute for Global Health and USC Spectrum hosted Dr. Denis Mukwege, the founder and director of the Panzi Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, at the USC Caruso Catholic Center.
Tireless advocate · Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Denis Mukwege shares stories of mass atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday at the USC Caruso Catholic Center. – Dasha Kholodenko | Daily Trojan
 
Mukwege has become known worldwide for his work in the field of medical treatment of survivors, in particular women in Congo who have been brutally raped. He has also become one of the most well-known advocates for the rights of women in Congo.
Mukwege has received numerous awards and honors for his work both as a doctor and as an advocate, including the U.N. Human Rights Prize and the Clinton Global Citizen Award. This Friday, he could be named the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize Winner for his work.
“It is extremely important to bring a figure like [Mukwege] to a university, especially to USC, because it amplifies the cause and gives it a stronger presence among people who are willing and able to make a change,” said Janice Kamenir-Reznik, the event moderator and co-founder of Jewish World Watch, one of the main sponsoring organizations.
Mukwege has previously addressed the United Nations General Assembly and frequently travels abroad to raise awareness about the severity of the situation in Congo. This was his first appearance in Los Angeles.
During his talk,  Mukwege focused on sharing stories of the atrocities that occur in the Congo, and  urged the attendees of the conversation to take a stand against these acts of cruelty and violence.
“This issue involves many different fields, and it is so important that more people become aware of it,” said Devra Traiman, a senior majoring in sociology. “It [was] honestly incredible to hear about all of the selfless work that he has done for this cause, and I hope that the event gets people more involved in [the issue].”
Though Mukwege, who does not speak English, had a translator relay what he was saying to the audience, his message still generated an intense audience response, including a standing ovation after Mukwege gave his initial speech.
“I am asking you here, this afternoon, to break the silence,”  Mukwege said via translator. “Each one of us can help humanity, and support the values that have fostered human life.”
Students were impressed by the work that Mukwege does, and felt that though the widespread use of violence in Congo is difficult to full comprehend, it still carries relevance and involves a number of different fields of interest and study.
“I found many parts of [Mukwege’s] work really relevant to a lot of the stuff that I’ve studied,” said Kayleigh McGuinners, a second-year law student and member of the International Human Rights Clinic.
Mukwege stressed the magnitude and severity of the violence in Congo despite its physical distance from the typical USC student. Many of the students who attended the event, however, said they were already aware of the situation in Congo.
“I’m in the Immigration Clinic in the Gould School of Law, and it was very interesting to hear about [Dr. Mukwege’s] advocacy, because it relates to a lot of the principles I’ve studied,” said Nadia Danilovich, a second-year law student.
Mukwege urged students to take action to put an end to the mass violence.
“I ask you to give the world your voice so that we can end this senseless abuse and give back dignity to these women,” Mukwege said.
Many students found this direct call to action moving.
“After learning about the horrible violence against women that is occurring in the Congo, it is so inspiring to hear [Mukwege] speak, not only because he is a renowned advocate for the issue, but also because he is actually out there trying to mediate and eventually put a stop to the conflict,” said Yvette Chua, a sophomore majoring in international relations and a member of the USC Student Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy.

After remaining undefeated in conference play this past week, the No. 2 USC women’s volleyball team (14-1, 4-0 Pac-12) swept all Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for matches played Sept. 30 to Oct. 6.
Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and senior libero Natalie Hagglund were named the conference’s offensive and defensive players of the week, while freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week for the second consecutive week. All three players were instrumental in USC’s two wins over Cal and No. 7-ranked Stanford.
Olgard was the Women of Troy’s most consistent offensive weapon, putting up 31.5 total points with 24 kills and a .590 hitting percentage. She also had only one error on 39 total attempts and was the catalyst of the team’s eight-point comeback in the third set against Stanford to complete the sweep of the Cardinal. In the match, she had nine kills on a .643 hitting percentage and also totaled five blocks. Olgard notched a career-high in kills (15) and points (19.5) against the Golden Bears.
On the season, Olgard has 103 total kills, good for fourth-most on the team, and her .452 hitting percentage is the highest mark of all USC players and ranks second in the Pac-12. As a junior last season, Olgard had 223 kills and posted a team-leading .394 hitting percentage
Hagglund came away with defensive honors after averaging just over five digs per set in USC’s two latest wins. She recorded 14 digs in the Women of Troy’s three-set win over the Cardinal and caught fire during in the                                                                      five-set thriller against Cal, notching 28 digs. With yet another stellar week, Hagglund is inching closer to the 2,000 career digs milestone, and if she gets there, she would be only the second USC player ever to do so.
Hagglund’s season average of 4.77 digs per set currently leads the Pac-12.
Completing the sweep of the Pac-12’s weekly awards, Nwanebu was deemed the conference’s top freshman for her phenomenal performance last week, in which she posted back-to-back double-digit kill matches with 13 against Stanford and a career-high 21 against Cal. Nwanebu also recorded seven blocks for USC, two against Stanford and five against Cal.
Nwanebu has 156 kills on the season, good for second most among all USC players. She also ranks third on the team in blocks, with 40, trailing only Olgard and junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer.
This marks only the second time that the Women of Troy have swept the weekly conference awards, with the first time being exactly one year ago.
Aside from player achievements, USC head coach Mick Haley notched career win No. 1,100 last week.
USC gets back on the road this week for four straight matches away from the Galen Center. The team will make the trip up to the Pacific Northwest to take on the Oregon schools on Oct. 11 and Oct. 13.

The USC women’s soccer team was hoping to bounce back from a tough loss in its Pac-12 opener against Arizona State when it returned home to McAlister Field to face Washington and Washington State on Friday and Sunday, respectively. Unfortunately, the Women of Troy finished the weekend winless in conference play, suffering a 1-0 loss to the Huskies and a 2-0 loss to the Cougars.
Friday’s match was a battle of two opposing mindsets, pitting an aggressive USC (5-6-1, 0-3-0 Pac-12) team against a more defensive Washington (5-5-1, 1-0-1 Pac-12) squad. The Huskies entered the game with 10 goals scored and 10 goals allowed on the season, while USC had 21 goals scored and 11 goals allowed in their first 10 matches of the year. The teams appeared to switch game plans in the early goings, with Washington spending most of the opening minutes on the USC side of the field. The Huskies outshot the Women of Troy 7-4 in the first half, scoring the lone goal in the final minute on a shot from the left side by forward Allie Beahan, her second of the season.
USC picked up the pace in the second half, missing out on a few scoring opportunities, including a pair of shots from freshman forward Tanya Samarzich and senior midfielder Jordan Marada around the 90th minute, which were both blocked. USC outshot the Huskies 7-2 in the second half and 11-9 for the match.
“We compete, and I think our possession is fine, but we can’t put that final shot away,” junior forward Jess Musmanno said. “I don’t know what it is, but we’re getting really unlucky in that last third.”
USC junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley finished with four saves on five shots on goal, helping keep the game close. Washington’s Megan Kufeld had two saves.
“The final third just wasn’t happening for us,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We weren’t able to get any good looks today. The looks we did get were forced looks, lax, impatient. We’ve got to get better.”
The Women of Troy went back to their more offensive playing style against the Cougars (8-1-3, 1-1-1 Pac-12), generating better scoring opportunities and more effectively moving the ball around Washington State’s half of the field. A corner kick from sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink was deflected by sophomore defender Whitney Pitalo in the 26th minute, but the ball went just left of the post.
Washington State got on the board in the 37th minute, with midfielder Mesa Owsley getting a shot over the outstretched hand of Stanley to give the Cougars a 1-0 lead. They almost got another quick one past Stanley on a fastbreak three minutes later, but the ball went over the crossbar.
“We got a lot of numbers up top and made sure that the people at the front were working their behinds off,” senior forward Elizabeth Eddy said about the increased pace of play in Sunday’s match.
The Cougars outshot the Women of Troy 6-5 in the first half. USC’s aggressive play was evident on the stat sheet, as they committed eight fouls to Washington State’s six.
USC continued their aggression in the second half, generating several scoring chances that the team was unable to capitalize on. Washington State added to their lead when forward Kourtney Guetlein scored after a USC turnover to give the Cougars a 2-0 lead. The Women of Troy were able to keep generating opportunities to cut the deficit, but couldn’t put a shot on net, finishing the game with only one shot on goal out of nine total.
The loss was USC’s fourth straight and first of the season by more than one goal. The Women of Troy have been held scoreless in almost 380 minutes of game time and have yet to score in     Pac-12 play.
“When you’re struggling to score goals like this, you fall behind and the pressure adds on,” Khosroshahin said. “I thought the ladies kept battling and working all the way ‘til the end.”
The Women of Troy will have their work cut out for them as they look for their first conference win, with a road trip up north to take on No. 13 California (9-0-3, 2-0-1 Pac-12) on Oct. 11, followed by a big match against No. 2 Stanford (9-1-1, 2-1-0 Pac-12) on Oct. 13. They will then return to McAlister Field to take on Arizona (5-4-3, 0-3-0 Pac-12) on Oct. 18. All three games will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

They are a young team that is improving every game.  Obviously you haven’t watched them play!
When will the coach be fired? He won a tittle with someone else’s players but can’t develop his own or recruit his own.  Plus his screaming is horrible, Haden should fire him.  He hast lost the team the same way Kiffin lost the football team.

Over the better part of the last decade, the national perception among college football fans and media has been that the SEC is the dominant conference. Year in and year out, SEC teams are held on a higher pedestal than teams from other conferences, a sentiment that is reflected in the national rankings.
This season though, things appear to be changing. The Pac-12 is making its case for being the best conference top-to-bottom in the country, and the case is a strong one. Oregon and Stanford are both unbeaten and pose a legitimate threat at ending the SEC’s current seven-year run of national championships, while UCLA is 4-0 and currently sitting just outside the top 10 at No. 11 and 13 in media and coaches’ polls, respectively.
The Pac-12’s strong performance in nonconference games this season (29-5 combined record) has bolstered its national perception, and the general consensus is that the Pac-12 is stronger as a whole than it has been in years.
Considering the current state of USC, this is rather surprising.
During the heyday of the Pete Carroll era, the then-Pac-10 was often referred to as “USC and the Nine Dwarves,” in reference to the Trojans’ seven-year run as conference champions from 2002 to 2008. When the SEC began its current streak of consecutive national championships in 2006, many Pac-10/12 followers believed that if the conference were to usurp the SEC, then other Pac-10/12 teams would have to join the Trojans among the nation’s elite.
So it is a bit ironic that as the current Pac-12 is finally challenging the SEC for conference domination, USC is nowhere near being part of the discussion. Once shunned by the national media, the rest of the conference is stepping into the spotlight in a big way.
Consider that, from 2004 to 2009, ESPN’s popular College Gameday show, which travels to the “game of the week” each Saturday during the season, featured a Pac-10 school only 13 times. Of those 13 games, 11 of them involved USC. From 2010 to present, Gameday has showcased nine games featuring Pac-10/12 schools, and the Trojans have only participated in three of them, including last season’s game against Notre Dame, one in which the Irish, who were undefeated and ranked No. 1, were admittedly the main draw.
NCAA sanctions levied upon the Trojans in 2010, of course, are largely to blame for USC’s struggles and lack of national attention in recent years. But consider me among those surprised that the Pac-12 has had as much success as it has this season without the luxury of leaning on USC as a national power.
Every major conference has traditional titans that it promotes as flagship programs. The SEC has Alabama, the Big Ten has Ohio State and Michigan and the Big 12 has Texas and Oklahoma. The Pac-12’s only real traditional powerhouse is USC, and one would assume that in the conference’s most successful season in recent memory, USC would be leading the charge. That the Pac-12 has thrived without much help from the Trojans speaks to the ability of other teams in the conference to build successful, sustainable programs, as well as commissioner Larry Scott’s effective national rebranding strategy.
The Pac-12 Network, now in its second year of existence, ensures that every Pac-12 football and men’s basketball game is televised nationally (unless you are a DirecTV subscriber). This has allowed conference teams to reach a wider range of fans and, as a result, a wider range of national sportswriters and rankings voters.
The old school of thought that games on the West Coast are played too late in the evening for East Coast voters to watch is slowly eroding. After then-No. 15 Washington lost to No. 5 Stanford on Saturday in a tightly-contested game that didn’t kickoff until 10:30 E.T., voters showed the Huskies respect by only dropping them one spot in both the AP Poll and coaches poll, indicating that they actually watched the game rather than simply checking the final result Sunday morning.
Of course, the season is still young. Being able to claim the national championship does not necessarily make the SEC the de facto best conference in the nation, but to many college football followers, a non-SEC school needs to hoist the crystal football in order to change the national perception. This will be a tough task for any Pac-12 team, considering the conference’s depth and nine-game conference schedule (most BCS conferences play only eight conference games).
But the opportunity is there for the Pac-12 to unseat the SEC from its throne this season, which is a good thing. The fact that it is occurring with no help from the Trojans is the only downside.

It’s been an eventful two weeks for USC football, but the Trojans are now putting their 62-41 loss to Arizona State and the firing of head coach Lane Kiffin behind them to focus on their upcoming opponent — the Arizona Wildcats.
Welcome back · USC senior tailback Silas Redd is expected to make his long-awaited season debut on Thursday against Arizona. – Daily Trojan file photo
Interim head coach Ed Orgeron will lead the team against Arizona in his first game as a head coach since 2007.
On the mend
Many a USC fan’s heart stopped last Saturday when junior wide receiver Marqise Lee was injured in the fourth quarter at Arizona State.
Since being diagnosed with a knee sprain, Lee has been spotted on crutches and has not practiced.
Orgeron is doubtful that Lee will return to practice this week, but didn’t rule him out completely for Thursday’s game, allowing a shred of hope for the Trojan faithful.
“Thursday night’s a long time from now, and guys seem to make miraculous recoveries, so we’ll keep on working,” Orgeron said.
If Lee sits out of Thursday’s game, the Trojans will be left with only two healthy wide receivers on scholarship — sophomore Nelson Agholor and redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell.
Perhaps the absence of Lee won’t doom the Trojans this Thursday, though. Agholor has proven capable of making big catches, and when redshirt junior tight ends Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer have been targeted, they’ve been successful.
The lack of depth at the receiver position might prompt more emphasis on the running game than usual, so senior tailback Silas Redd’s return couldn’t come at a better time.
Redd’s knee surgery last spring has kept him out of the first five games of the season, but he wore full pads on Monday and looked explosive as he blew past defenders despite wearing a brace on his left knee.
With Kiffin’s departure, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Clay Helton will serve as the playcaller, and time will tell whether he will utilize Redd as a boost to the already-impressive running game headlined by redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden and freshman tailback Justin Davis.
Polar opposites
Redd’s energy in practice exemplified the atmosphere of the  newly installed Orgeron era.
Though Kiffin usually remained stoic on the sidelines, there was never a dull moment at practice on Monday, as Orgeron barked out orders, and the players raved about the newfound intensity of the team.
“Oh, we love it,” redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw said. “He brings a lot of energy in here and we feed off him … Energy is up about 10 times, you could say.”
The team will need to maintain this energy in Thursday night’s game, as they face a formidable opponent in Arizona running back Ka’Deem Carey, who is ranked fifth in the nation in rushing yards per game.
As a sophomore last year, Carey led the nation in rushing yards, earning him a spot on multiple preseason awards watchlists for 2013, such the Walter Camp Award, given to the best college player of the year.
USC’s No. 14th-ranked defense will do its best to slow down Carey and quarterback B.J. Denker, who has been a running threat this season, totaling 280 rushing yards and a team-high six touchdowns.
Milestones
The game against the Wildcats will represent a number of firsts for USC.
It marks the first regular season, non-Thanksgiving Thursday night game ever hosted by the Trojans.
But that note has been eclipsed by the fact that it will be the first time Orgeron will run out of the tunnel as USC’s head coach.
Orgeron, who served as the head coach of Mississippi from 2005-2007 and has worked as the defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator at USC since 2010, has no reservations heading into his first game calling the shots.
“[There’s] a little pep in my step — I’m ready to go,” Orgeron said. “I’ve seen the guys … they fire me up. I mean, the eyes and the way they’re reacting, they’re smiling and walking around here enjoying practice.”
The players explained their motivation to help Orgeron record his first win as USC’s interim head coach.
“Everyone wants to come out here and play as hard as they can because everyone likes Coach O and they want to make sure we do good for him,” sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams said. “We just want to play up to his expectations and just have fun.”

When he made the decision to relieve former head coach Lane Kiffin of his duties last week, a major concern for USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was that the impending search to fill the head coaching vacancy would take on a life of its own and distract the current team.
 
 
For the record · USC Athletic Director Pat Haden cleared up reports that individuals posing as a USC affiliate contacted Tony Dungey and the Denver Broncos about the school’s vacant head coaching job. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Approximately 10 days into that search, Haden’s fears have been confirmed in a bizarre turn of events.
USC was informed on Monday that individuals unaffiliated with the university have made contact with potential candidates to gauge their interest in the head coaching position.
In the first reported case, a person claimed he was a high-ranking member of the USC athletic department and made overtures to an unnamed member of the Denver Broncos’ coaching staff.
USC alumnus Jack Del Rio is currently the defensive coordinator for the undefeated Broncos, but he has been rumored to be one of the top candidates to replace interim head coach Ed Orgeron at the end of the season.
The university has identified the person who made contact with the Broncos’ staff and action has reportedly been taken.
In the second instance, another person “representing USC” attempted to reach out to former NFL head coach and current NBC sports broadcaster Tony Dungy to discuss the position.
Dungy was a head coach for over a decade with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and, more recently, the Indianapolis Colts, but stated during today’s Dan Patrick Show that he has no interest in becoming the next head coach at USC.
USC has also identified the individual who contacted Dungy and officials are currently in the process of reaching that individual and taking action.
Haden seemed shocked by the news and wanted to emphasize that he did not authorize these overtures.
“I can assure you no authorized representative of USC or our athletic department made these calls,” Haden said in a statement on Monday.
For now, he would like the athletic department and fans alike to focus on the current team, which plays Thursday night against the visiting Arizona Wildcats.
“As I said last week, we will not comment on every name that comes out. It would be a disservice to our players and coaches, who are devoting everything they have into the remainder of our season,” Haden said in a statement. “We have a head coach right now in Ed Orgeron. We have not offered that job to anyone.”

It’s March 21, 2006. After another long day of debugging and hashing out code at the startup, co-founder of Twitter — twttr at the time — Jack Dorsey sends out the first-ever tweet.
What Dorsey published was nothing out of the ordinary. The small team at twttr didn’t know what to think of the idea at first. Biz Stone, who worked alongside Dorsey, was passionate about the project, but some people weren’t as thrilled.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Stone said, “A lot of people thought it sounded stupid. Even some of our engineers weren’t interested.”
Whether or not Dorsey or Stone knew just how big Twitter would get, they’ve been running with their product since day one, and they’ve been doing a pretty good job at it. So it might not have come as the biggest surprise when last week, Twitter announced that it intended to raise $1 billion from a share sale.
There are elements that work for and against Twitter. Public companies such as McDonald’s, Priceline and even Salesforce.com have been, for the most part, successful because they offer services and products that can be bought and sold for a direct profit.
It’s risky to go public when the majority of your revenue relies on advertising. Facebook, of course, is the first example that comes to mind. If your company does not offer anything that can generate revenue by being sold, it’s tough to prove to investors that you’ll be in for the long haul.
This is one of the more concerning aspects of Twitter’s initial public offering. Because advertising accounts for 87 percent of its revenue, the only impactful way Twitter could grow is by getting more brands and advertisers who would be willing to advertise.
It’s even riskier to go public when you’re a startup. Back in 2011, Zynga had about 270 million monthly unique users playing its games, particularly FarmVille and CityVille. The gaming startup looked extremely promising then, but now, two years later, its founding CEO, Mark Pincus, has stepped down, its major OMGPOP acquisition has closed shop and shares continue to slide.
King.com has recently filed for an IPO, with a monthly active user base that has surpassed Zynga’s. But despite its success with Facebook apps, it isn’t very clear how much money the website can raise.
Twitter, on the other hand, is not the startup it once was. The company now has nearly 2,000 employees and more than 500 million users. Twitter has also taken the time to prove itself as a viable public company with its strong choices in acquisitions.
MoPub, which Twitter bought recently for $350 million, is a startup that helps mobile publishers maintain their ad inventory. With Facebook posting great numbers in mobile advertising, and considering that 43 percent of people tweet from their phones, it was a tremendously smart move on Twitter’s part — a move that instilled more optimism than pessimism in Twitter’s IPO decision.
Other great acquisitions include Tweetdeck, which not only makes Twitter easier to use (which helps retain users), but also makes delivering sponsored content more effective.
Vine, which, like many startups, hasn’t generated any revenue on its own, was able to gather a very dedicated following and has carved an interesting niche for itself as the six-second entertainment video app.
The similarities between Facebook and Twitter regarding IPOs cannot be overlooked. Sure, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was a little cockier about going public. Facebook also boasts a larger user base and longer average sessions. Not to mention the fact that Twitter uses an underwriting team that is remarkably similar to that of Facebook, even though Morgan Stanley, one of Twitter’s underwriters, published earnings estimates before the allowed time period.
But here’s the rub — unlike Facebook, which filed for $16 billion just a year ago, Twitter is filing for $15 billion less. Compared to other tech IPOs, that’s $600 million less than Google’s initial offering (2004), the same as Zynga’s (2011) and $900 million more than Apple’s (1980).
Personally, I do think Twitter’s asking price is high, but definitely more reasonable than Facebook’s filing. Though Facebook offers more variety in its advertising in terms of how it’s delivered, including sponsored pages, sidebar ads and mobile ads, there’s a touch more creativity in Twitter’s ads. How about a sponsored tweet? Maybe a sponsored trend?
Twitter isn’t closed-minded, which might sound like a nightmare to some shareholders. But it’s this openness to exploring new ideas that has definitely helped Twitter to distinguish itself. The hashtag, for example, wasn’t planned. After seeing how its users were categorizing their posts, Twitter decided to make it an official part of the site, and now the hashtag has taken on a completely different meaning in today’s society (#crazy, right?).
Vine, which was a risky enough venture, had no plans of becoming an entertainment app. But once it started to become clear that Vine was becoming like YouTube for those with six-second attention spans, Twitter went with the users and introduced channels and, of course, hashtags and tagging.
It’s both a scary and exciting time for Twitter. Once the company officially goes public, it will be harder for its execs to maintain full control. But something tells me Twitter was ready for this, like the first time Dorsey sent off the first recorded tweet. Twitter’s official ticker symbol, TWTR, looks more like an all-caps abbreviation of the original “twttr” moniker — and you can’t help but feel that the ticker symbol is another beginning of financial growth for this grown-up startup.

Contrary to what the media might show, Miley Cyrus doesn’t just wag her tongue and twerk around with a platinum pixie cut and teddy bears strapped to her back — she actually does make music. And her highly anticipated album, Bangerz, which drops Tuesday, proves it.
Twerkin’ to the top · Miley Cyrus drew influences from hip hop and enlisted the help of producer Mike WiLL Made-It on Bangerz. – Courtesy of RCA Records
Bangerz is Cyrus’ fourth studio album, but given its content, it might as well be her first. It would not only be foolish but also irrelevant to compare it to the work of her last album three years ago, Can’t Be Tamed, which served as her first attempt to unshackle herself from Disney’s chains. Nor does it make sense to compare it to Breakout, which solidified her presence as a household name. Nor — cringingly — to Meet Miley Cyrus, her 2007 solo debut.
Leading up to Bangerz, Cyrus’ two singles, “We Can’t Stop” and “Wrecking Ball,” blew up YouTube with provocative, high-budget music videos (one shot by renowned celebrity photographer Terry Richardson). They have garnered more than 400 million views on YouTube combined and the two singles continue to shine as some of the best of Bangerz.
The former is an urban-inspired pop song that shows Cyrus could care less about what you think of her. For many, the song is regarded as the party tune of the summer.
Though many have already heard “Wrecking Ball” — if for no other reason than to watch the music video — it deserves to be discussed, because it is Cyrus at her best. This is her niche and the standard to measure the rest of the record against.
Cyrus’ raw vocals overpower the simple electric piano for most of the song, but the strong bass is where the song really kills it. For Cyrus, it’s the right pop ballad with the right tempo, and it’s no wonder that “Wrecking Ball” is her first and only song to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States so far.
The first track on the album, “Adore You,” is another standout ballad. Its deep, drawn out notes allows Cyrus’ voice to precariously balance between love and longing. The lyrics, though not revolutionary, effectively depict a soft vulnerability in Cyrus. This especially comes through in the chorus: “When you say you love me / No, I love you more.” The symphony of strings and short bursts of violin on the track make it all the more powerful.
One of the ways in which Cyrus makes herself incomparable to her former self is her ability to use influences from various genres: from country to hip hop to pop to R&B. One of the best songs that exemplifies this is “FU (feat. French Montana).” The track jumps right in, with the screeching line, “Oh you broke my heart.” The song captures the spurned love that Johnny Cash or Dolly Parton would sing about. It’s sassy and spunky. As Cyrus croons, “And now I’m cryin’, cryin’,” the artist seems to embrace her country roots. If anything is going to separate Cyrus from the rest of pop music artists right now, this is the track that will do it.
The fusion of country and hip hop continues with “4×4 (feat. Nelly).” In a sentence, the song is best described as a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking, rough-around-the-edges version of Hannah Montana’s “Hoedown Throwdown.” Cyrus sings about riding around town, being thrown in jail and just acting like a “female rebel.” The addition of Nelly’s R&B-styled contribution to this track makes one imagine cowgirls square dancing in a barnyard in downtown Detroit with gold grills and shredded overalls.
Bangerz isn’t always a good time, though. In Cyrus’ “SMS” collaboration with Britney Spears, Cyrus unsuccessfully attempts to channel Salt-N-Pepa with her tongue-in-cheek verses (Note the line, “They ask me how I keep a man / I keep a battery pack”). “SMS” feels forced and manufactured. Spears, however, delivers with a highly synthetic whisper on vocal tracks layered on top of each other.
Another miss comes in the almost so-bad-it’s-good track, “#GETITRIGHT.” The track combines an upbeat, almost kid-like whistle of a tune with cheesy lines of seduction, such as, “Don’t you think it’s time to get it on?” Perhaps best summed up as baby-making music gone wrong, it at least might make one crack a smile.
In a recent interview with entertainmentwise.com, Cyrus said she wanted to set a new standard for pop music. Though Bangerz might not be that groundbreaking, it does add a dirty, Southern flair to current bubblegum pop music, and speaks, in the words of Cyrus, “on behalf of the country girls who are turnt up.”
If nothing else, Bangerz has to be one of the best reinventions of a pigeonholed artist in a long time. Through it, Cyrus proves she is much more than a Disney queen — she’s someone that has the potential to not only stay in this industry for a long time, but also to thrive in it.
“Bang B–ch!”

War Horse, a novel-turned-play, has been nominated for dozens of awards both in London and the United States and now is coming to the Pantages Theatre beginning Tuesday.
Riding into Los Angeles · War Horse follows the story of Joey, a foal that develops a relationship with Albert, its owner’s son. The horse is sold to the U.S. Cavalry, and Albert enlists in the army to retrieve Joey. – Courtesy of Jamie Loeb
Originally a 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, War Horse has become an international phenomenon in print, on stage and on screen.  When Morpurgo was first approached about adapting War Horse to a stage production, he was hesitant. The show proved an instant success, however, soon touring the United States and inspiring a Hollywood film in 2011.
The performance tells the story of Joey, a foal purchased at a small-town auction. As he grows up, Joey forms a strong bond with his purchaser’s son, Albert, but before long, Joey is sold to the U.S. Cavalry at the beginning of World War I. War Horse follows Albert as he joins the Army to rescue Joey from behind enemy lines.
War Horse is unique in the sense that it tells the story of an animal, a feat that has had little success on Broadway previously. Theater puppets often present a hassle for productions and provide forgettable results, but War Horse makes excellent and efficient use of handcrafted puppets. The Handspring Puppet Company, who designed and crafted all of the animal puppets in the show, won a special Tony Award at the 2011 Tonys for its work in War Horse. Jessica Krueger, puppeteer for Joey in this production, said the puppets are one of the show’s biggest draws.
“By and large, audiences are surprised by War Horse … Even if they’ve seen the TV commercial or read the book or seen the TED talk, they say they were amazed. They’ve never seen anything like it,” Krueger said in an email.
Krueger said she loves the atmosphere that the puppeteering aspect of the show creates.
“War Horse requires a level of ensemble I have not experienced with other productions. It’s both challenging and rewarding to share a role with two other people,” Krueger said. “It requires a kind of ego sacrifice that, as an actor, you don’t get asked for very often.”
Krueger became involved in War Horse after she heard it was coming to Broadway and watched a TED talk by the Handspring Puppet Company. She noticed while watching that all of Joey’s puppeteers were male but felt that she was perfectly capable of filling the role. Krueger auditioned and was soon an integral part of the show.
One of Krueger’s biggest challenges about being Joey was maintaining character while playing a horse. Krueger credits her background in anthropology with helping her acclimate to the role.
“Both disciplines are all about context. I find that my training in anthropology helps me to constantly connect with the context of whoever I am playing, or what actors tend to call the ‘given circumstances,’” Krueger said. “In War Horse, one of the challenges is keeping our responses horse, not human, or dog, or cat or any other kind of pet.”
The puppeteers, most of whom have undertaken a completely new experience in their careers, turn puppetry into poetry with their performance. Many show reviews describe the puppeteers as being better and more memorable than the actual actors in the production. At the very least, War Horse promises a unique stage experience.
Though War Horse was released as a film, Krueger said the plot differences and the puppetry make the theater production and the film entirely different experiences.
Though the War Horse film was nominated for six Academy Awards, the theater production has garnered even more acclaim. Among its many accolades are five 2011 Tony Awards, including one for Best Play.
Krueger, who was part of War Horse when its tour opened at the Ahmanson Theatre last summer, appreciates Los Angeles audiences.
“The great thing about L.A. is that [audiences] are always hungry for the new thing. … [They] come in and are ready to see what [we] have for them,” Krueger said.
 
War Horse opens at the Hollywood Pantages on Oct. 8, with tickets starting at $32 and will play until Oct. 13.

Yesterday marked the 12 year anniversary of the war in Afghanistan. Americans have grown weary of the drawn-out conflict’s undefined goals and increasingly unsustainable financial costs. According to a CBS News poll, support for the war in Afghanistan plummeted last year to its lowest with only 1 in 4 Americans agreeing that the United States is doing the right thing. President Barack Obama responded to this political reality when he announced last February that “by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.” But will there really be an end to the Afghanistan war?
There were three ends to the war in Iraq: The first was in May 2003, when President George W. Bush announced, “Mission accomplished,” in an infamous speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln just two months after the invasion of Iraq. The second was in September 2010, when “combat troops” silently crossed the Iraqi border into Kuwait, an event Obama’s MSNBC boosters were breathlessly proclaimed as the triumphant “End of the Iraq War.” The third was in December 2011, when the Iraqi parliament refused to grant further immunity to U.S. troops beyond 2011, finally forcing to U.S. troops’ withdrawal from Iraq. If Iraq had three “end of wars,” how many will there be in Afghanistan? According to the Washington Post, a few thousand U.S. combat troops will likely remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014 to train and advise security forces. Despite this promise by Obama of the war’s end, American presence in Afghanistan will merely add to the grim death toll after 2014.
According to Los Angeles Times, an American service member was killed last week in an “insider attack” — incidents where Afghan allies attack the U.S. troops who train them. This recent event follows another from the weekend before in which three U.S. troops were killed. According to NATO, in 2011 and 2012, 97 coalition members were killed by their Afghan counterparts in these insider attacks. Even as the United States shifts its role from combat to advisory and training, deaths from insider attacks will most likely continue. Taliban leaders, including Mullah Muhammad Omar, have urged their sympathizers and members to continue to infiltrate the security forces and kill American trainers and Afghan trainees.
Bob Dreyfuss wrote in The Nation that military commanders believe in an “insurgent math” — that is, for every civilian the U.S. military kills, 20 insurgents take their place. Approximately 6,841 civilians have been killed since the beginning of the Afghanistan war. Using this “insurgent math,” that would mean the U.S. military has created more than 120,000 insurgents who continue to threaten the lives of U.S. troops and Afghans loyal to the Karzai regime. These newly created insurgents have empowered the Taliban as evidenced by a recent article by the Associated Press, which reported that Taliban fighters have started an insurgent campaign of regaining lost territories as foreign troops depart. After 12 long years, $600 billion spent, more than 2,000 military deaths, 6,000 civilian deaths and tens of thousands of lives irrevocably altered, when will Americans muster the political will and courage to end America’s longest war? Renaming the war is not progress, it is not peace and it will certainly not stop American deaths.

Last Tuesday, the nation awoke to yet another government shutdown, this time because no agreement on a fiscal spending plan had been reached. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the GOP’s mission to defund it became a centerpiece in the impasse. Though the GOP might insist on passing a bill that will tear down the Affordable Care Act and the Democrats insist on keeping it, both sides are damaging the health of the nation. Even with the shutdown, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act will continue — a fact that indicates it’s time for negotiation and to avoid hurting the basic premises of the health care system.
Teddy Park | Daily Trojan
The shutdown has complicated and endangered several aspects of our government: According to news site Aljazeera America, it has hampered food inspections, disease monitoring and other “nonessential” health functions. Furthermore, the shutdown began in October — the starting month of the flu season. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been forced to stop operating its disease monitoring systems, placing limits on identifying and preventing outbreaks from mutant strains. Though it still has the capacity to respond to outbreaks, finding them is key.
PulseNet, the site to which states report incidents of outbreaks, has been down since the shutdown began. This has increased the chance of an outbreak being identified too late. The government shutdown has also impeded the Food and Drug Administration’s day-to-day activities. As it is responsible for monitoring 80 to 85 percent of the nation’s food supply of fruits, vegetables and seafood, there could be a rise in food poisoning. On top of that, the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest source of medical research funding, ceased reviewing or issuing research grants, a very real setback for scientific research. According to Aljazeera America, the NIH’s news media branch chief Renate Myles said that 200 new patients at the NIH Clinical Center in Maryland will be deferred until the end of the shutdown. If it lasts until next month, more than 1,000 patients could be turned away.
The GOP’s effort to delay implementation of Obamacare is not only proving to be futile, but detrimental on these levels. The Democrats’ refusal to negotiate — and risk pulling back some aspects of Obamacare, such as the medical device tax — is also a problem.
Currently, attitudes on both sides don’t match sincere hopes to reconcile. USA Today reported that Obama “insists he will not negotiate major budget issues with congressional Republicans until they vote to reopen the government and to lift the debt ceiling.” Republicans are guilty of the same. Rather than delaying progress, both parties need to be willing to negotiate for the sake of our country.
The Affordable Care Act, the largest health care expansion since Medicare was passed in 1965, launched its new online marketplaces last Tuesday, despite the government shutdown.
Right from the start, glitches began happening. According to the Los Angeles Times, last week — the first week the online marketplaces of the Affordable Care Act opened — more than 8.5 million people visited the federal healthcare.gov website. Millions of Americans also flooded websites, call centers and insurance offices in search of more information about health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Very few of these interested consumers, however, have been able to complete the application process because of technical problems that repeatedly shut down online marketplaces, including the federal site. Before last week, according the Times, public opinion polls still showed the many Americans remained skeptical of the Affordable Care Act. Some say that the numbers do not represent a high level of consumer interest, but instead, most are really trying to explore out of curiosity. Whatever the case might be, there’s a lot to be done to improve the system, and it can’t be done without the support and the brainpower of a united collection of minds, especially at the head of this country.
Once the blame for the current crisis stops being passed around in a game of hot potato, some negotiation is needed. Forget about the politics and coming out on top of the shutdown, and instead consider the realities right now and what people, regardless of political position, can do to build upon what’s there to work with, transforming negatives to positives, one issue at a time.

I hope all who support Obamacare – graduate and become immensely successful. 
That way you can have over half your wealth redistributed every year to people who love Section 8 housing, food stamps, govt cheese and subsidized health insurance. After you realize for 6 months out of the year – you are waking up early everyday to go to work for these welfare addicts, you will still be accused of not paying your fair share and still receive accusations of racism, misogyny and worse if you disagree.
When Detroit went bankrupt and its politicians were asked about recovery, all the mealy-mouthed politicians kept saying Detroit did not go broke overnight. 
Detroit is a microcosm of things to come in US unless we really start thinking critically about our socialistic path
If I were the GOP I would quit the charades, open the Government for the markets, and go down in history as only ‘temporarily’ insane.
No SANE party of ‘patriots’ would intentionally crash it’s own nations economy by ‘URGENT CHOICE’,… of this there is no doubt.

Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission top administrator John Sandbrook was found guilty of testifying falsely during USC’s lease negotiations with the Coliseum on Oct. 4, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Luis A. Lavin ruled that Sandbrook falsely stated under oath his reasons for why the lease negotiations between the commission and the university could be kept secret, which both contradicted Sandbrook’s prepared agenda and violated the Ralph M. Brown Act, California’s open-meeting law guaranteeing that actions and deliberations of public commissions, boards and councils be conducted openly.
“In light of the Commission’s refusal to admit any wrongdoing, its aversion to transparency… and Sandbrook’s false testimony that certain closed session agenda items noted as anticipated litigation related to the negotiations with USC over the amendment of the lease,” Lavin wrote in his decision, “the Court finds that the Commission will continue its unlawful practices.”
Lavin issued an injunction barring the panel from discussing a range of topics behind closed doors and requiring it to record its meetings for three years.
The ruling was made in light of a lawsuit against the commission by the Times and Californians Aware, a nonprofit 1st Amendment organization. The suit alleged that the agency repeatedly violated the Brown Act while conducting meetings behind closed doors to grant USC control of the Coliseum.
Lavin’s ruling also ordered the commission to release communications between Sandbrook and USC during the lease negotiations that it had initially refused to produce to the Times.
“Certainly the public has a legitimate and substantial interest in scrutinizing the process leading to the commission’s deal with USC for the use and management of the iconic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Los Angeles Sports Arena,” Lavin wrote.
