Spring is coming, and all over Japan, flowers are just beginning to bloom. A little over a week ago, I went with a group of friends to Kamakura-shi, in Kanagawa Prefecture. Kamakura is known for being the seat of the Shogunate during the famed Kamakura Period and within its borders are a number of famous shrines, temples, and museums.
Hase-dera is one such temple, located near Hase Station on the Enoshima Electric Railway Line. It is a short walk from the station, which is small and wooden. By the entrance, there are several ponds, with fat koi fish drifting slowly through the waters. It was still too early for most of the trees to flower yet and their brown branches were thin and bare. To the left of the main path, however, there were sweet-smelling cup-shaped white blossoms that looked like they were growing against the pale sky. Its sign identified it as 白木蓮, or white magnolia.
The main attraction of the temple is a wooden statue of Kannon, traditionally the goddess of mercy. It had eleven heads, each supposedly representing a different stage of enlightenment, and though it was hard to tell in the low, flickering lighting of the chamber, it seemed to glitter in gilded gold. Scattered all around her were charms for sale, and I spent a long time flipping through a small booklet, containing a list of Chinese characters and their various denotations and connotations. You were supposed to choose one, and then write it with a brush on a smooth stone and leave it in the temple as a wish to the goddess. (I didn’t do it, by the way. I didn’t want to offend Kannon or embarrass myself with my less than admirable penmanship.)
On the extreme right of the grounds was the Benten-kutsu, or Benten Cave. It was carved into a mountain-side, its entrance marked by the red arches of the Shinto torii gate. Within, the tunnels were low and narrow, and you had to fold yourself nearly in half to go through certain sections. (“No, Jasmine,” a friend of mine quipped from behind me, “I think you can go through the entire thing standing.”) The walls of the cave were filled with statues and devotions to Benzaiten, the only female goddess among the Seven Lucky Gods featured in Japanese mythology. She represents beauty, art, knowledge, and especially music and is often depicted with a biwa, or a traditional Japanese lute.
One of the interesting points about Japanese religion is that it is adaptable (as adaptable, say, as the English language). Buddhism and Shinto started off as two separate religions, but now you see Shinto gates on Buddhist temple grounds, and no one thinks twice about it. I love to visit temples and shrines because they are often in close vicinity to one another, and in the same few blocks, there can be any number of Buddhist and Shinto gods and goddesses housed in harmony with one another. Within these religions there are a number of stories and traditions from the rich history and mythology of Japan, and every visit is well worth the time.

This week, the USC Admissions Center sent out thousands of packages containing good news: acceptances to this university, and more importantly, invitations to join the Trojan Family. As the academic year is quickly drawing to a close, it is astonishing to think that nearly one-fourth of my college experience is over. What a year it has been.
When I arrived on campus in late August for move-in day, I felt like college was a temporary entity. I expected to go home after a few weeks, and the structured activities of welcome week seemed a bit like summer camp. I don’t remember much about the first couple months of school, except that it felt so weird to be starting over, both socially and academically. I do, however, remember the late night studying, my self-proclaimed rebellions against dining hall food and the constant feeling of anxiety hanging over my head. It was hard for me to relax, as I constantly felt like I had to prove to myself and others that I was worthy of attending this university. USC had always been my dream school, and even after I was admitted and started classes in the fall, I found it hard to believe I was actually here.
But thinking about it all in hindsight makes me realize that amidst the busyness of college life, I haven’t even had a chance to let my college experience sink in. When the stress of midterms, papers, office hours, club meetings and social events surround you, it’s hard to appreciate all the amazing things about college.
For one, I am grateful to have such a great group of friends that I can’t imagine living without. I am grateful for some of the amazing classes I have taken that I know I would not have had anywhere else. Most of all, I am grateful for the opportunity to grow personally and intellectually at this wonderful university.
In some of my toughest moments this year, I have sometimes questioned my choice to come here. It’s easy to pick out the negatives rather than highlight the positives. But as my one year anniversary with USC approaches, there’s no place I would rather be. This is home.

Kevin Harvick has had a storied racing career, from winning seven national go-karting championships when he was young to winning his first championship at NASCAR’s top level, the Sprint Cup Series, in 2014. On his way to the Sprint Cup Series, he won the 1998 NASCAR Winston West Series (now the K&N Pro Series West) Championship and is also a two-time champion of the NASCAR Busch Series (now the XFINITY Series). In the Sprint Cup Series, Harvick’s accomplishments go beyond his 2014 championship. He won Rookie of the Year in 2001 and has won some of NASCAR’s biggest races, including the Daytona 500, the Brickyard 400, the Southern 500, the Coca-Cola 600, the Sprint All-Star Race, and the Sprint Unlimited.
The Daily Trojan sat down with Kevin Harvick for a couple of minutes on March 20 before racing activities began for the weekend’s XFINITY Series and Sprint Cup Series events at Auto Club Speedway. As we sat outside in the motor coach area, we discussed topics ranging from Harvick’s hometown of Bakersfield to the success of his Stewart-Haas Racing team.
James: “I’ve read that Rick Mears was one of your favorite drivers growing up. Why was Mears such a big inspiration for you besides the fact that he also came from Bakersfield?”
 
Kevin: “I grew up around Rick’s son Clint. We raced go-karts together. Then you had Roger and his whole family, and then now Casey racing in the Cup Series. I think when you look at the Indy Car Series at that particular time, that was really the biggest series in racing and Rick was kind of the king of that series during that particular era. So being from Bakersfield, it was just natural to root for Rick Mears, and as a kid growing up racing go-karts, you wanted to race in the Indy 500. Obviously, that didn’t work out and go that direction luckily, but all-in-all it was still really cool to have Rick as a part of the community at home.”
James: “Speaking of Bakersfield, your hometown, you continue to have a close connection with Bakersfield. Earlier this week, you were at the Bakersfield Boys and Girls Club where it was proclaimed that the day was ‘Kevin Harvick Day.’ What has changed in Bakersfield since you were young and what is it like knowing that the town that you grew up in and have done a lot for now has a day named after you?”
Kevin: “I think when you look at Bakersfield, it’s always been a very supportive community. I always tell people it’s kind of weird to have stuff like that happen in your hometown because I’ve gone back to Bakersfield really since I left and that would have been in the late ‘90s. So I go back there at least once or twice a year to visit my friends and family. This particular time, we were fortunate to go back and be able to make a good contribution to the Boys & Girls Club. I enjoy the town, I love where I came from, they’ve always been very supportive of everything that I’ve done, and now to be in the position that we’re in and be able to give back to the community is even cooler.”
James: “As you’ve risen through the ranks throughout the years, you competed in and been successful in a lot of different racing divisions, including late models, the Featherlite Southwest Tour, the K&N Pro Series, the Camping World Truck Series, and the XFINITY Series before obviously coming to the NASCAR (Sprint Cup) Series. Which of those series do you believe taught you the most about racing and what lessons did you learn in each series that you continue to use today in your Sprint Cup Series career?”
Kevin: “I think a lot of it is just a progression. I think when you look at starting off in go-karts, that really taught you the basis of how to race. No matter what you race, you are learning how to pass, you are learning to be in different situations, whether it was go-karts or stock cars. You still were racing and having to deal with situations. But I think as you go through time and you look at all the things that we were able to accomplish, probably the Truck Series was the biggest base of the foundation just for the fact that you got to go to a lot of the bigger race tracks for the first time on a national level, and be able to race against guys and really see how much harder it was, especially as you went up into the XFINITY Series and into the Cup Series. I came through the NASCAR ranks just how they were designed. I started in go-karts, and then I started in NASCAR: the late model series, and Southwest Tour, and Winston West, and Trucks, and XFINITY, and Cup. It was just how you would lay it out, and that’s what I always tell people: if you’re going to race and you’re not successful at the level that you’re at, there’s no reason to go to the next level because it’s only going to get harder.”
James: “One of your biggest breaks when it came to rising up through the ranks was, unfortunately, with the tragic death of Dale Earnhardt back in 2001 in the Daytona 500. Richard Childress appointed you to drive the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet under the #29. Let’s just say Childress did not make that move. Without Childress making that move, do you think that you would have the success that you’ve had in your career in the Sprint Cup Series? And where do you think you would be now and what would the journey have been like in NASCAR had Childress not appointed you at that time?”
Kevin: “I think we would have actually been in a better position, just for the fact that we had just signed America Online to a four-year contract for my Cup Series career. Atlanta was actually supposed to be my first race in the America Online car. I was scheduled to run seven races that year and then run full-time for the next three years with the group of guys that I was brought up through in the XFINITY Series. When everything happened with Dale, it was more out of necessity for RCR (Richard Childress Racing) and the company to keep going. But really, it really mixed everything up and really got me away from all the guys that I had been groomed and brought up with through the XFINITY Series, and then went with another group of guys and then things started to get shifted around. It took four or five years to really get a group of people around me that I was comfortable with, but it added a lot of complications to a lot of different things that obviously we had to deal with. But I think in the end, the path was already laid out for me to go Cup racing and it probably would have gotten off to a different start being around the group of guys that I grew up racing with.”
James: “Let’s skip over now to the beginning of last year when you switched to Stewart-Haas Racing. Since your move to Stewart-Haas Racing, you’ve been arguably the most dominant driver in the Sprint Cup Series. In your first season (with them last year), you had 5 wins, 8 poles, led more laps than any other driver, and you finally got your first Sprint Cup title. You’ve continued your dominance this year with two wins and two second-place finishes in four races. How have you and your team been able to put together such a strong performance in the short time you’ve been with each other? Is it the chemistry, is it the Stewart-Haas race cars, or is it something else?”
Kevin: “It’s the chemistry between all of it. You look at the core group of guys on our #4 team and you see how well everybody gets along, and how long most (of) everybody has been in the sport and you mix that in with a couple of young guys. But off the racetrack, these guys spend a lot of time together and enjoy being around each other. Then you add in Gene and Tony on the ownership side of things that allow Rodney a lot of free reign to do what he wants. You take that and you put it together with Hendrick Motorsports with the engines and chassis and resources that we get from Hendrick. There’s a lot of good things that come together, but the core of that whole thing is the chemistry between our #4 team.”
James: “Now I want to kind of go specifically into two different tracks where you have been really strong at: Phoenix, which you went to last week, and then Atlanta. So Phoenix, you’ve won there seven times (and) it’s very difficult with that dogleg corner that they have. Then Atlanta is just super slick. You’re one of the few drivers that has been able to figure it out at both tracks, with your wins at Phoenix and then in your last five races at Atlanta, you’ve finished four times within the top ten. In the XFINITY Series, you’ve won the last three races in a row at Atlanta. How have you been able to figure out those two difficult tracks when most of these other drivers can’t?”
Kevin: “Phoenix is a racetrack that I grew up racing on and they’ve obviously repaved the original track since we’ve come over the last few years. But I think as you look at the characteristics of Phoenix, they’re very similar to what they used to be and a lot of the characteristics at Phoenix in (turns) three and four are very similar to the old racetrack, so I think there‘s a lot of things that still apply there. I grew up racing at Phoenix and a lot of these tracks on the west coast that are very flat-type racetracks, so that was kind of the style of tracks that I grew up on. I think when you look at Atlanta, it’s just one of those places where the yellow line (has) some things about it that really help and I think Mesa Marin, the old track that I used to race at, is probably partially responsible because it’s the same style of driving and the things that you look for as far as things that can help you make your car handle. It’s a much bigger racetrack than Mesa Marin used to be, but a lot of the same styles and things that you look for to try to make the car go around the corner.”
James: “Now I want to switch over to NASCAR and all the different changes that they made. I’m not going to ask you your opinion on any of the changes that they’ve made. Among the recent changes they’ve made, obviously last year they changed the entire Sprint (Cup Chase) system to like a win and you’re in situation, and then this year they’ve added the in-car trackbar adjuster. As a driver and as a team member, how hard is it to adjust to the new rules that NASCAR announces and what kind of game plan do you and your team go through when a new change is announced?”
Kevin: “I look forward to the rules changes because I feel like our team is good at adapting to things. I think Rodney and Mike on the engineering team do a great job of getting there first before everybody else. That’s become pretty typical in NASCAR. NASCAR tries to make a lot of rule changes at the end of the year to make the competition better, not only for the race fans but make the competition more affordable for the race teams and the owners. There’s a lot for NASCAR to balance, but I think when you look at the engine package and what that’s going to turn into over the next couple of years and the amount of money that’s going to save the owners,… those are some big savings that could come there. I think when you look at the things that have changed this year for me, it’s probably a lot less than what it is for Rodney and those guys to adapt the set-ups to just because it’s really the same driving style (and) it’s just a lot more throttle time.”
James: “Moving away from NASCAR, I have two other questions for you. Getting into your personal life a little bit, your wife DeLana a couple of years ago gave birth to your son, Keelan. How did you come to the name Keelan and what has been some of your favorite moments so far with Keelan?”
Kevin: “Keelan was just really a name that we picked really, really quick. It’s kind of got a little bit of Kevin in it and a little bit of DeLana in it. We used the middle name Paul; that was her dad’s middle name. Obviously, he’s got the Harvick last name. Keelan has just really added a great balance to our life and really allowed us to look at everything that we do. (He) has allowed us to simplify life because our two goals were to be good parents and make sure we were doing a good job at work on Sundays. I’m fortunate I get to take my wife and son to work with me most of the time, at least until he gets old enough to go to school. But for right now, it’s a lot of fun and added a great balance to our lives.”
James: “I want to close by talking about your philanthropy. Your Kevin Harvick Foundation supports programs that help children around the United States, including an athletic scholarship at CSU Bakersfield. What are some of your favorite success stories from children who have benefited from the programs you support?”
Kevin: “From the time we started the foundation in 2007, it really stemmed from a fundraiser that we had at my old high school at North High and I think that’s probably the favorite thing that we’ve been able to do. When we started that fundraiser in 2007, the wrestling team was getting ready to shut down; the school was not really in a great spot. I went back there this week and you look at the wrestling team, (it has) as many kids on it as it’s ever had, the sports programs are doing great, (and) the school is in the middle of a complete renovation process that they hadn’t had since the late ‘50s/early ‘60s. I think when you look at the impact that we‘ve been able to be a part of and the amount of kids that we’ll be able to affect through the years at that particular high school is really, really exciting for me. When you look at the principal and the people involved in the school district that have been a part of making all that stuff happen, it’s just really, really exciting and makes you feel like you’re making a difference.”

Recently, I visited the very popular You are Here Café with a few friends. Now, I didn’t know this until I actually went to the café, but it’s actually owned by Eat Your Kimchi and Talk to Me in Korean.
For those of you who don’t have a clue who or what Eat Your Kimchi and Talk to Me in Korean are, they are YouTubers well known for making videos on all things Korea or Korean. Many people are probably more familiar with Simon and Martina (the married couple who moved to South Korea from Canada, and the creators of Eat Your Kimchi) who make videos about Korean culture and the culture differences between Korean culture and Western culture. Talk to Me in Korean makes videos that are more centered on learning Korean language.
The café is located in Hongdae, which is the area around and named after Hongik University. Hongik University has one of the nation’s best fine arts colleges, and thus, rather appropriately, the area surrounding the university has an urban, young, artsy vibe. Almost somewhat obviously, Hongdae is an area that provides entertainment, and thus is one of the centers of club culture in Korea. While the area itself is bustling, the part of Hongdae that the café is located in is actually quite calm and residential.

The café is unique, not only in their amazing dessert and beverage menu, but also the fact that there is a ‘classroom’ within the café in which they have language lessons. They also have ‘language exchange’ nights where people gather and just talk to one another, learning about different languages and cultures (and just getting to meet new people!). They also have a ‘Speaker’s Corner’ which is basically a booth where you can go in and speak to a camera about your thoughts on the ‘assigned topic.’ The camera records your message and you can get a chance to be featured in one of their videos!
The café has an awesome and friendly atmosphere where you can go to meet new people, learn new languages and/or cultures and munch on some delicious snacks. So, whenever you’re in town, stopping by You are Here Café is a must.

With barely five weeks left of class, it’s safe to say that the most difficult time of the year is upon us. The Trojans have just returned from spring break, and regardless of where they went or how they spent their time, they must now face the reality of the remainder of second semester. USC students must push fond memories of the Cabo sun or their mom’s cooking to the back of their minds, and manage to fight their way through midterms — and finals — in spite of their desire to hit the beach or work on their tans instead. Here are a few tips for making the last weeks of the school year as painless as possible
1. First and foremost: don’t give up! You have made it this far in the semester, you might as well hold on until the very end. It’s easy to give in to the temptation to skip class in favor of something a little more fun (and decidedly less productive). But don’t give in! Merely being present in class — both physically and mentally — is half the battle in keeping your GPA right where it should be. (And no, online shopping for a new bathing suit during lecture does not count as attentively attending class).

2. Stay organized. Much like the way it seems really appealing to skip class, the end of the year may tempt you to become lazy with your organization. Keeping class notes and digital documents in clearly labelled notebooks and folders will make your life substantially easier when finals roll around. It’s certainly a better alternative to having random loose-leaf papers scrunched into the bottom of your backpack, or being unable to see your computer desktop background because you have so many documents.

3. Let yourself take breaks. Chances are that most students are already feeling pretty burnt out by this time of year. Staying focused on the end goal of a good GPA for second semester can seem daunting, especially with midterms and finals looming. It’s important that you let yourself take breaks to go enjoy the nice weather and hang out with your friends, all in the name of breaking up your study time. (Just make sure you keep a good ratio between study time and break time).

4. Get excited for the summer. One of the best ways to make it through the grind of schoolwork is to look forward to something which, at this point, is probably summer. Are you traveling? Did you land a killer internship? Get excited and consider it your motivation to power through the home stretch of the school year.

5. Relax and Reflect. Try not to worry; summer will be here before you know it. Be proud of yourself for almost finishing another (or your first) year of college. Now just keep fighting on all the way until May.
