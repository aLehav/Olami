Returning from its two-game series in the Bay Area last week, the men’s basketball team is preparing to take the floor Wednesday night when it will play host to the Colorado Buffaloes at the Galen Center. The Trojans split their conference contests up north last week.
An 80-62 victory over Cal (7-9, 1-2) on Jan. 4 was Andy Enfield’s first road win against the Golden Bears in his five-year tenure as head coach of Troy. However, USC (11-6, 2-2) failed to complete the Bay Area sweep, as the team would lost to Stanford Sunday evening. 
In the 77-76 loss to the Cardinal, USC encountered defeat in about the most painstaking way possible. A dazzling finish at the basket from senior guard Jordan McLaughlin resulted in a layup that put the Trojans ahead 76-74 with 1.7 seconds remaining in regulation. Stanford (8-8, 2-1) proceeded to inbound the ball and Cardinal guard Daejon Davis hit a 55-foot 3-point basket as time expired to put a devastating nail in the coffin for Enfield’s Trojans.
“I’ve never lost a game like that one, it’s tough. You think you have the game won when [McLaughlin] makes the shot, but then they just make a spectacular, spectacular play,” Enfield said. “There’s not a lot you can say after a finish like that … It was an emotional roller coaster, everyone was upset, but you just have to regroup and move on now.”  
Entering the Galen Center Wednesday night is a Colorado (10-6, 2-2) team which is coming off of a pair of strong home wins against the highly ranked Arizona schools. The Buffaloes topped a then-No. 4 ranked Arizona State team, 90-81, in a contest that went to overtime on Jan. 4. Colorado followed that performance up with an 80-77 upset of then-No. 14 ranked Arizona this past Saturday.
Colorado’s leading scorer, freshman guard McKinley Wright, averaged 17.5 PPG, 7.5 APG and 3.5 RPG in both contests and collected Pac-12 Player of the Week honors last week. 
“Colorado’s playing well, they’ve picked up strong home wins, but now it’s time for our guys to do the same and hold down their home court,” Enfield said. “Especially in these conference games.”
If USC is going to bounce back against the Buffs, they will look to force Colorado into taking tough shots. USC is 6-0 this season when limiting the opposition to lower than 40 percent shooting from the field. In contrast, the Trojans have posted a 5-6 record when opponents shoot above the 40-percent benchmark. 
“Our defense has been picking up, that’s definitely been one of our biggest focus points,” said McLaughlin, who recorded 16 points and seven rebounds in the team’s loss to Stanford. “Our offense is doing just fine, averaging around 80 points per game. Defense is what we’ve been working on daily, and it’s getting better too.” 
McLaughlin currently leads the Pac-12 in assists per game, at 7.9. He will look to get USC’s vast array of offensive weapons involved early and often against Colorado. The Trojan arsenal includes junior forwards Chimezie Metu (averaging a team-high 17.2 PPG) and Bennie Boatwright (16.6 PPG, team-high 7.3 RPG). A competent defensive effort and the utilization of their veteran offensive talent will be key factors in determining whether USC can boost its conference record past the .500 mark. 
“Tomorrow night’s game is going to mean a lot to our team,” said senior guard Elijah Stewart, who is averaging 11.5 PPG this season. “We’ve just got to play our brand of basketball and get the win.”
USC may have some extra motivation entering tomorrow night’s contest following comments made by Colorado head coach Tad Boyle. Following the Buffs’ win against Arizona, a reporter asked Boyle whether the win against the Wildcats gave him “extra satisfaction” due to the fact that Arizona was involved in FBI investigations regarding corruption this offseason. 
“Absolutely, there is [extra satisfaction] … I’ve got great respect for Arizona coach Sean Miller and the kind of coach he is,” Boyle said. “[Arizona] recruits very, very well … USC has recruited very, very well. The two most-talented teams in our conference from top-to-bottom are USC and Arizona. So hell yes there’s satisfaction … To answer your question, hell yes there’s more satisfaction.”
USC players did not take too kindly to the coach’s remarks.
“[Colorado’s] coach was kind of bad-mouthing us, so he made it personal,” Stewart said. 
Enfield, whose USC basketball program was involved in the same FBI investigation as Arizona, issued a public statement following the team’s Tuesday practice. 
“We are disappointed in Tad Boyle’s comments and what they imply,” Enfield said. “Not only is it unfair for someone to comment, who doesn’t have all the facts, but those comments are unfair to those of us involved with the USC men’s basketball program. Most importantly to our student-athletes and their families, they are outstanding young men who chose USC to earn a world-class education and to compete for championships.” 
Ha! Leave it to southern cal fans to take a complement and make it an insult. Tad literally said you have the one of the best teams in the conference and you’re upset? Huh… usually only guilty people get mad at the statements about them….

Ninety-nine percent of the time, I write about USC sports. But today, I knew I had no choice but to talk about Atlanta, my hometown and a long-suffering sports city.
Monday’s College Football Playoff National Championship offered another entry into Atlanta’s long history of teams coming up just short. And it was painful. Georgia had Alabama on the ropes, just a couple of stops away from winning their second consecutive overtime thriller. But, as usual, it just wasn’t meant to be. 
Georgia did everything it needed to do to win. The team stuffed the Crimson Tide offense, took a commanding 13-0 halftime lead, passed effectively and nailed a 51-yard field goal in the first overtime. On the other hand, Alabama did everything it needed to do to lose. They threw an untimely interception in the third, gave up an 80-yard touchdown pass and shanked a game-winning 36-yard field goal as the clock expired in regulation. 
But then it happened. After moving backward on a sack, Alabama’s freshman backup quarterback Tua Tagovailoa launched a perfect pass to a wide-open Calvin Ridley on 2nd and 26. Touchdown. Game over. 
It was supposed to be the moment Alabama head coach Nick Saban’s empire fell at the hands of his former apprentice: Georgia’s head coach Kirby Smart, who served as Saban’s defensive coordinator from 2008 to 2015. It was supposed to be a statewide celebration for the virtual home team. It turned into a nightmare. 
I don’t usually buy into sports curses. But, I can tell you that Atlanta is 100 percent, fully, unequivocally cursed. There’s no other explanation. 
This curse dates back to the Falcons in last year’s Super Bowl. The offense, orchestrated by a budding genius in offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, was loaded with playmakers. They led the league in scoring and quarterback Matt Ryan earned his first career MVP award. But no one will remember any of that, and why would they? Instead, people will forever mock how the Falcons raced to a 21-3 halftime lead with the Patriots’ dynasty teetering on the brink of extinction, only to give up 27 unanswered points and lose in over-time. Sound familiar? 
Before the Falcons debacle, there was the 2014-15 Atlanta Hawks — one of the strangest and most fleeting NBA success stories in history. Genuinely one of my all-time favorite teams to watch, the Hawks had no real stars, but they had a philosophy based around ball movement and shooting lots and lots of 3-pointers. It worked. They won 60 games and sent all four starters to the All-Star Game, earning the moniker “Spurs of the East,” for the way they mirrored Spurs coach Gregg Poppovich’s system. 
In the 2015 Playoffs, the Hawks ended up being swept by the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals and the team has never looked the same since.     No starters remain from the 2014-15 squad, and as a result they are languishing at the bottom of the standings hoping for a lottery pick rather than a ring. Now, it’s hard to imagine the 10-30 Hawks being the “Spurs of the G-League,” let alone the Eastern Conference. 
There are even more examples. In their inaugural season this year, Atlanta United FC became the darling of the MLS for their constant attacking style and sky-high attendance numbers. But United lost in penalties to the Columbus Crew in round one of the playoffs, ending a spectacular debut season on an oddly anticlimactic note.
Even Atlanta’s lone championship comes with an asterisk. The Atlanta Braves won 14 straight division titles from 1991 to 2005 but came away with just one World Series in 1995 to show for it. Only when compared to Atlanta’s recent woes does the run feel satisfying.
As you can now surely tell, some dark, powerful force hates the city of Atlanta with a passion and it takes out this anger by causing our sports teams to flounder in the biggest possible moments. 
Although this is undoubtedly a difficult circumstance to be in, I have a hopeful message for Atlanta’s sports teams: Never change. Stay innovative like the Falcons’ offense in 2016. Stay different like the Hawks’ no-superstar lineup. Stay exciting like Atlanta United in their first season (Sports is entertainment, after all).  Keep making fans believe even in championships evenwhen they seem unattainable. As  Georgia head coach Smart likes to say and say often, “Keep chopping wood.” 
Cleveland and Chicago recently broke their so-called “curses” when the Cavs and Cubs clinched championships. All Atlanta can do now is try to move past another heartbreak and hope their time is coming soon.

Paul Thomas Anderson has been deemed one of the greatest directors of his generation by critics and audience members alike. While he has directed only a few films during his 20-year career, all of his movies have received critical acclaim, and a few of them have even been regarded as some of the best films of the past decade. With this already impressive lineup, he recently released his eighth movie, Phantom Thread, and gave us one of his biggest cinematic accomplishments to date. 
Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a celebrated dressmaker who falls in love with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps). Photo from IMDb.
Set in 1950s London, the film follows dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he works in a controlled environment under the watch of his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville). When he travels to the English countryside during the holidays, he falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps). But as his relationship with her wavers, Alma’s presence soon becomes a disturbance in his work environment.
Anderson’s film tells a tale of intimacy and heartbreak as it follows  the relationship between Reynolds and Alma. Filled with plot twists and shocking, suspenseful moments, Phantom Thread illustrates the toxicity of obsessiveness, as both characters illustrate this behavior in different ways. 
The film simply plays out, and the audience is often and suddenly caught off guard because even the film’s most surprising scenes are tonally consistent with the film’s calm nature. The film’s twisted and emotionally mature plot twists  seem to have earned it its R-rating.
Throughout the film, scenes are framed differently to distinguish disruptiveness in the relationship, such as when Woodcock is working meticulously and Alma disrupts his precision. 
In contrast, the film presents a more crystal clear image of Woodcock when he is focused on his work. At the beginning of the movie, the lighting reveals the shiny details of Woodcock when he prepares for the day, and a sharp contrast arises between the dark and light colors. When Alma starts to interfere with his perfect work mentality, the scene begins to blend the contrast between light and dark, and the film transitions into a more grainy look.
In his fourth collaboration with Anderson, Radiohead lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood composes the film’s music and gives us one of the most emotional soundtracks of 2017. Each track finds the balance between emanating a scene’s emotional weight and creating recognizable ballads for the audience, as every instrument conveys something different in each song. In the piece “House of Woodcock,” the flowing sounds of the piano capture an intimate feeling while the orchestral strings evoke the time period’s elegance.
Of course, at the forefront of all of these impressive elements is the film’s dynamic cast. In this film, Anderson gives viewers the antithesis of his previous film Inherent Vice. Instead of cramming in many big-name Hollywood stars and being muddled with excessive padding, Phantom Thread is tightly focused on one plot with fewer locations and three major characters.
While Manville and Krieps give strong performances as their respective characters, it’s Day-Lewis who stands out the most. Not only did he learn how to sew a Balenciaga dress from scratch in preparation for the role, but his subtle, yet expressive nature is present with his line delivery. Without resorting to overly histrionic behavior, the English actor still demands the viewer’s attention as he takes control of each scene. And, with the recent announcement of his plan to retire from acting, he could not have chosen a more perfect film with which to conclude his 46-year acting career.
Indeed, Phantom Thread is easily the best film of 2017, as its attention to detail in every scene is palpable. The film isn’t as ambitious as There Will Be Blood or The Master, but it still feels epic in-scale with the framing of every scene. Phantom Thread is a perceptive film that resonates with you long after you watch it, even if you’re not immediately impressed by it. It’s a rare work of art that only a master like Anderson could’ve so intricately crafted.

The beginning of the spring semester, in tangent with the start of the new year, always includes promises of self-betterment and  plenty of motivation to match. Students return with well-rested brains after a month-long break, equipped with New Year’s resolutions to focus on all semester. 
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
As great as these ideas sound, New Year’s resolutions never seem to last past the first two weeks, as it can be difficult to consistently work toward them all year. Nevertheless, this year will be the year you finally break through that two-week block, and here’s how you’ll do it.
The day before class starts, plan out your semester. Fill in  your electronic calendar, or buy a physical planner if you don’t carry a laptop around for classes. By organizing your schedule like this, you will be able to set aside time that will not clash with your prior commitments, and spend that time following through on resolutions, such as working out at the gym.  
Make promises to yourself to attend every class and download to-do lists and Chrome extensions that help with motivation. Take advantage of that adrenaline rush from the “new year, new me” mentality and make 2018 the year you finally achieve those goals you have not achieved in the past.
Usually, the first few days of class will be refreshing — a good exercise for a brain that hasn’t been used since early December. However, by week two, you start to lapse back into old habits. You think to yourself, “today’s my cheat day, I’ll get back on the grind tomorrow.” The day after, you tell yourself the same thing. Within a few days, those goals that you set two short weeks ago have fallen apart, and another year goes by without change.
This year, when you hit that slump in week two, push through. Ignore the devil in your head telling you to give up. Instead, keep your calendar and to-do lists open on your computer and use it as a motivator. Continue to hit the gym, go to your 9 a.m. class and get to sleep at a reasonable time. 
Reward yourself with small things, like getting yourself an açai bowl if you successfully adhere to your goals for a whole week. Those few days might seem like the worst few days of your year, but they are also the most important. With small rewards and motivators, the whole process will become less grueling and more doable. As soon as you get through those few days, the rest of the year will be an easy cruise.
Studies have shown that humans tend to view their future selves as other people, and therefore form unrealistic expectations for what’s to come. However, it’s much more important, and useful, to imagine your present self in your future self’s shoes. If you can follow through with your goals, not only will you improve, but your future self will have a much easier time improving as well. By studying that extra hour for your class and abolishing cheat days, you are doing your future self a huge favor.
Whether it is a healthier lifestyle, better grades or better relationships with friends and family, these New Year’s resolutions were created to incite change in your life. It takes hard work and dedication to follow through on these goals, but the outcome will certainly be worth it. Make this semester the semester you turn your life around because after all those years of procrastination, it’s about time for a change.

Los Angeles is a metropolitan hub for Jews. After the New York City area, Los Angeles has the most Jews in the United States. And yet, in a city with over 600,000 Jewish people, USC does not adequately offer dining hall food that meets the religious dietary restrictions of this community. 
Observant Jews follow strict dietary restrictions and can only eat foods that are “kosher,” as delineated in the Hebrew Torah. The religious laws are extensive and include a particular way of slaughtering animals, several forbidden types of food, utensils that have not touched any of the forbidden foods and supervision of the cooking. The food at USC dining halls, which does not separate items like meat and dairy, is inherently not kosher. The utensils and plates at the dining halls, which cannot come into contact with pork, do not meet the basic kosher requirements either.
There are easy solutions to satisfy the needs of the observant Jewish community that numerous major universities have already implemented: a kosher-option meal plan or a kosher restaurant on campus. Over 350 campuses across the country have kosher options in their dining halls or a kosher restaurant on campus. Every Ivy League school has one, USC’s crosstown rival UCLA has one and even Colorado State University in Fort Collins — a school with just 500 Jewish undergraduates comprising 2 percent of the total undergraduate population — has one. The question is, why doesn’t USC?
According to USC Hillel, it should. Of all private universities, USC has the 12th most Jewish students. Roughly 11 percent of USC’s undergraduate population is Jewish, and six percent of all graduate students are Jewish, for a total of some 3,500 students.
Reports from USC Hillel and USC Chabad — two Jewish organizations on campus —  as well as the Office of Religious Life indicate that USC Hospitality is looking into a kosher meal plan. According to an email sent by USC Hillel on Jan. 3, the University is “working hard to ensure the availability of Kosher meals on campus” and is planning to offer three kosher dinners every week for students who sign up in advance. 
According to an email sent by the Office of Religious Life, no date or location has been finalized for the plan. 
USC Chabad Rabbi Dov Wagner and his wife Runya Wagner both said they have tried to convince the University to offer kosher food for over 14 years, and that there have been several previous attempts by the University to meet the dietary needs for observant Jews, none of which have lasted. 
For instance, in the early 2000s, the University agreed to host kosher food trucks around campus. These food trucks would not accept dining dollars or meal plan swipes. The food trucks decided not to return to campus after realizing their profits were not as high as they could be operating in a more heavily concentrated Jewish neighborhood. 
The University has a responsibility to make sure all of its students have proper meals available on campus. A student should not have to decide between living off snacks and not freely practicing his religion as a result of the University’s lack of action; students have a basic right to be provided with food that meets their religious standards. If prisons are mandated to provide their Jewish inmates with kosher food, then surely USC can make an effort to provide its tuition-paying students with the same.
The reality is that Jewish life at USC is vibrant and thriving. Wagner said that Chabad at USC reached over 1,000 students last semester. Additionally, he said that the Fall 2017 semester was one of the most successful semesters in his 18 years leading Chabad at USC. And while Chabad at USC and USC Hillel are providing for the growing Jewish community when it comes to spiritual meaningness, classes and social activities, the University has an obligation to provide them with adequate dining options. 
USC is a leading global university that competes internationally in academics, research, diversity and infrastructure. But the reality is there are hundreds of schools — plenty with a fraction of the number of Jewish students USC has — that outcompete USC when it comes to providing its students with food they can eat without breaking the rules of their religion. This needs to change. 
Another semester and more DT discussion of food.  This time I agree with the young lady(?).  I’d like to see more gluten-free options as well.
God Bless!

In the wake of the seemingly endless sexual harassment accusations that ban with the infamous Harvey Weinstein case, many of Hollywood’s stars — both men and women — have dealt admirably with the hidden corruption within the entertainment industry. The black dresses and suits that graced the red carpet were commendable nods to the fight to end sexual harassment in the workplace. Of course, this movement does not solely revolve around Hollywood: the recent “#MeToo” movement deftly used the platform of social media to encourage solidarity among an immense network of sexual harassment survivors.

Yet, in such a chaotic political environment, creating change may not be as simple as wearing a certain color or sharing a social media post; in this case, enough is never really enough. While the aforementioned trends have undoubtedly been helpful to the cause, institutional change across all industries — among university administration in particular — is imperative to finding a collective voice for unheard victims of sexual assault. 
On all college campuses, the cloud of sexual misconduct still looms large. In addition to the stresses surrounding moving away from home, balancing course loads and preparing for the workforce, far too many students — specifically females — are faced with the terrifying prospect of sexual harassment. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, nearly 23 percent of females will experience sexual assault at some point in their college careers. 
Put simply, the general response to this troubling phenomena from university administration has been weak. Survivors across the country  brave enough to come forward rarely see their perpetrators expelled — or punished at all for that matter. 
Perhaps one of the most important aspects of fighting sexual harassment is improving systems of reporting these cases as soon as they occur; in this arena, USC has been better than most at aiding victims of sexual assault. Here at USC, the administration has done well in clarifying campus sexual assault policies, including additional training for Department of Public Safety officers and Resident Assistants, creating a Sexual Assault Task force and partnering with Callisto, an online platform that allows users to immediately and securely report a case of sexual assault. USC has also established the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services (RSVP) program, which offers counseling for victims of sexual abuse and educational programs on understanding the facets of sexual violence. 
But while education is a core component of prevention, USC has fallen short in terms of addressing the toxic, gendered culture that promotes sexual assault.
In terms of education, USC requires students to complete an online, two-part program called “Think About It,” that exemplifies what a healthy relationship means. The full program is required only of new students and takes all of two hours to complete. But this platform is problematic: the format of the “training” does not necessarily engage readers or encourage them to truly digest the information provided — rather, it acts as an annoyance that students gloss over for the sake of completion. Given the comprehensive response in terms of resources for victims — which are incredibly necessary, and their importance should not be minimized — USC’s response in terms of addressing campus social climate has been inadequate. 
Opening up the issue to national discourse, it is difficult to navigate the overarching issue when the very person running the country is an alleged perpetrator of sexual assault. The Access Hollywood tape featuring President Donald Trump — as well as the accusations against leading lawmakers — is a prime example of the tendency of powerful figures to abuse their influence when it goes unchecked. This is not OK in Hollywood, and it certainly is not OK among government officials. 
Sexual harassment is a complicated and nuanced issue, and, especially for victims of sexual assault, sometimes it can be difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is, however, one new development to be hopeful about: Survivors are starting to be heard — by journalists, by Hollywood, by fellow survivors. Sure, institutional change — particularly among universities — is desperately needed. But for perpetrators of sexual abuse, time’s up. It’s been far too long.  
“The general response to this troubling phenomena from university administration has been weak” says champagne activists spouting identity politics on an outlet owned by the USC administration, probably hired directly by the University’s PR-team. The irony burns.

In college, National Public Radio’s first full-time television critic Eric Deggans discovered what he wanted his career to look like.

“I had a definitive plan,” Deggans said. “My goal was to be an arts critic with a national voice.” 
Deggans achieved that goal after spending nearly 20 years at the Tampa Bay Times as a television and media critic before joining NPR. 
Deggans spoke at Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday night about his role as a radio journalist and critic, and his experience with racism in the media.
Deggans came to USC as a guest speaker for students in the “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” journalism course. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Professor Mary Murphy, who teaches the class, interviewed Deggans, before opening the floor for questions for students. 
“I reached out to [Deggans] because I felt like he had a unique voice in terms of covering television and media,” Murphy said. “He was one of the few people of color in the Television Critics’ Association, and he represents the growing medium of radio and podcasting.” 
Although Deggans lives in Florida, he was in Los Angeles for a Television Critics’ Association conference, where major broadcast networks host press conferences about their television shows for the upcoming season. During the interview at Annenberg, Murphy asked Deggans about people of color who are leaders in the entertainment industry.
“When you’re a person of color in a position of authority, you have to be careful to make sure you don’t look like you’re tipping the scales in favor of people who look like you,” Deggans said in his speech. “White presidents of entertainment can be more aggressive in terms of meeting the diversity demand because they aren’t seen as having an agenda.”
During the conversation, Deggans talked primarily about the role television plays in determining national culture. 
“Everything happens on television — race, politics, gender issues,” Deggans said.“Whatever it is, it’s on television.” 
Deggans spoke about why he joined NPR, and  the emerging role of podcasts in modern culture.
“Podcasting opened up an avenue to young people that we didn’t have before,” Deggans said. “It builds a bridge for young ears — ‘Code Switch, Pop Culture Happy’ Hour — those podcasts talk about issues that young people are interested in.”
Deggans also discussed how the media has played a significant role in creating a political divide. This served as the primary subject of his book Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation.
“There are certain media outlets who have decided that their strategy for success is by dividing the audience and only serving a certain segment of the audience,” Deggans said. “Fox News has decided that white men is their target audience, so it presents the world in a way that is in concert with its viewers’ world view.”
Deggans grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, but went to a private middle school where only two other students were people of color. During his talk, Deggans spoke about how this experience influenced his role as a media critic. 
“What I do now is decode popular culture for a mass audience,” Deggans said. “And in order to do that, I need to understand white culture. I don’t think I would be effective at what I do if I didn’t know how to communicate about white culture.”
Undeclared junior Grayson Adler attended the talk as one of the students in the class. Adler said he enjoyed the talk because Deggans had a lot to say about popular culture.
“It was fascinating to hear his insight about [media] and how he built his career from his childhood onwards,” Adler said. “For people looking to get into entertainment and journalism, he’s definitely someone to look up to.”

Every other Sunday, Sofia Deak, a senior studying international relations and global business, wakes up early and makes the two-hour drive to San Diego with a team of 35 tutors to teach English to Syrian refugees. As president of Students Organize 4 Syria at USC, Deak coordinates these biweekly tutoring sessions as well as donation drives. 
The students in the club arrive in San Diego for their first day of tutoring. Photo courtesy of Sofia Deak.
“We train anyone who joins in ESL [English as a Second Language] tutoring,” Deak said. “[Students] get to work with people they have almost nothing in common with and form connections. The refugee community is one of the most welcoming communities of people I have ever met.”
Most sessions last one to two hours, and each session is built around the specific goals of the student being taught. Deak tutors a mother of four who already attends ESL classes twice a day and is primarily focused on learning how to read. 
“It is a judgement-free zone [when we are teaching],” Deak said. “We also socialize, share food and exchange pictures of our families.”
Some students have been inspired to get involved with Students Organize 4 Syria by their personal backgrounds. 
Asem Alahmad, a senior majoring in business administration, is a Syrian American. Alahmad, who believes teaching English and literacy skills is an important humanitarian effort, reached out to Deak last semester and started helping with the club.
To Alahmad, the impact of the club on refugee lives has started to become more evident.
“I can see the change happening before my very eyes,” Alahmad said. “We have gotten amazing feedback and seen families no longer need translators because of their level of improvement in the English language.”
Other students have become involved with Students Organize 4 Syria to gain more awareness about the worldwide refugee crisis. 
“In the media, Syrian refugees are often talked about in very abstract terms, by their critics and supporters alike,” said Aziza Kasumov, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism and international relations and current tutor of a family of five. “I wanted to get an idea of who these people are for myself.”
Kasumov and her teaching partner help the father of the family they teach by preparing him for college and helping him complete various legal forms. When not learning English, the father works long hours at his job and the wife assists other refugees in the community.
“Despite their circumstances, they’ve been incredibly welcoming and thankful whenever we stop by for tutoring, offering us Syrian sweets and homemade baked goods,” Kasumov said. “They deserve to be here, not to be stigmatized and alienated.”
The wait list for tutoring contains over 30 refugees seeking to learn. If you are interested in joining Students Organize 4 Refugees, email uscstudents4syria@gmail.com.

Provost Michael Quick announced Friday that USC will be restructuring the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund to “more closely align it to the mission and core values of the University.” 
Christina Yokoyama, who has been working at the Topping Fund for 11 years, has been removed from her position. Photo courtesy of USC Faculty WebsiteTopping Fund changes.
One of the changes to the Topping Fund was the elimination of the Topping director position, which has been held by Christina Yokoyama for 11 years. With the changes, Yokoyama will no longer be employed as director starting Feb. 1.
Since 1972, the Topping Fund has served as a student-funded and student-led scholarship program for underrepresented, low-income and first-generation students. Through mentoring services, special programming and open-door advising, the Topping Fund has provided scholars with several resources on campus.
“This is the only student-funded, student-led scholarship program of its kind in the country,” said senior Sabrina Enriquez, a Topping scholar who helped pen a letter to Provost Quick. The letter was signed by the Topping scholars as a plea for Quick to reverse the decision.
“This decision is indicative of a shift of values and shows us that first-generation students and Topping scholars are no longer valued or supported by administration as we once were,” the letter stated.
Quick, however, said in a memorandum addressed to the USC community that he made this decision in an effort to expand on the program while maintaining its history. 
“The core of the program is fantastic, and we have helped many students who are currently here and in the past,” said Andrea Hodge, vice provost of Undergraduate Programs. “They become a family of scholars, [and] we want to keep this family of scholars.”
According to the Provost’s memorandum on Friday, the program has traditionally been offered to “a small number” of students.   
“When you look at the history of [the Topping Fund], it was established to diversify the student population and be more than a scholarship program, and we can definitely increase the cohort size,” Hodge said.
Hodge said she consulted with the USC Office of Admission, the USC Financial Aid Office and the USC Graduate and Undergraduate Student Governments to make changes in expanding the program to more students. 
However, many of the Topping Scholars expressed frustration with the decision to remove the position and Yokoyama, and also with being excluded from the decision process.
“To bring in more students, in theory, is a really great idea,” Enriquez said. “To take one of our dedicated staffers who has really given her entire life to the program… it wouldn’t make sense that more students can be served with less [staff].”
Yokoyama explained that there was a lack of communication between Quick, the Topping Scholars and the Topping Governing Board, a group of students who are responsible for shaping the program by reviewing student applications and selecting scholars. 
Although Hodge notified scholars that changes would be put into effect in the near future, Yokoyama said the elimination of her position was never discussed with her. 
“I was called [into a meeting] to be informed that the Topping Director position had been eliminated, which meant my termination,” Yokoyama said. “It wasn’t even a conversation. [Hodge] spoke to me for five minutes. When I asked questions like ‘Is my staff safe?’ or ‘What other changes have been proposed?’… They refused to answer any questions.”
Many Topping Scholars and faculty members have stated their disapproval of Yokoyama’s firing, some penning letters to Provost Quick.
Some letters described Yokoyama’s dedication and support to the Topping Family as invaluable. Letters from scholars, the Topping Fund Governing Board Chairs from the past decade and former Associate Topping Fund Director Felipe Martinez have been sent to the USC Provost. 
Former Associate Vice Provost Gene Bickers and former Vice Dean for Diversity and Strategic Initiative for Dornsife George Sanchez, who have worked with Topping scholars in the past, also expressed disagreement with the changes to the program.
In a letter addressed to Quick and Vice Provost Elizabeth Graddy, Bickers and Sanchez asked for the Topping Governing Board to be involved with the decision-making process. 
“We believe this lack of consultation violates the unique governance model that has been in place for NTSAF since its creation nearly five decades ago,” the letter stated. “We believe it also contravenes assurances that were made to the board less than five years ago by Dr. Michael Quick in his role of Executive Vice Provost.”
Topping Governing Board members will be meeting with Hodge Tuesday morning to further discuss the changes that are being made to the program, as well as concerns regarding the removal of Yokoyama’s position.
“Many of our scholars have difficult situations that require more support than the average USC student,” Enriquez said. “What Christina does is not only get us in touch with all of these resources available to us that we may not know about, but she advocates on behalf of us. What we are essentially pleading is that they reverse the decision and reinstate not only the position of the director but that that director remains Christina.”
Yokoyama said she will be meeting with Provost Quick on Friday.
“This is a very significant, historical program, and it has been, because it is student-led,” Yokoyama said. “I’m dreading the changes to come and I’m very frustrated that these changes could not be shared with me or this division could not be worked on together, but instead it’s being taken over.”
Thank you for this article. Last year, we had a few students from our school apply for the Topping Scholarship Fund. We had one student receive the scholarship, and she is currently enrolled at USC. We are very excited to see that the program will be expanded to include even more first-generation college students. We will definitely encourage more students from our charter school to apply this year!
I think you’ve missed the entire point of this article. This article is over the termination of Christina Yokoyama, one of the most valuable assets to NTSAF. As a recent alumnus, I can ensure you that there are plenty of scholarships at USC specifically targeted towards first-generation college students. But there is only 1 NTSAF and one Christina. Not only have they eliminated position that runs the entire program, but they are not being transparent about future restructuring to the student-comprised Governing Board that runs the program.
As someone who was on the student governing board in the early ’80’s this move disappoints me. It was the bottom up and unique governing structure as well as special staff that made this fund special. President Topping is turning over in his grave. It was purposely separated from other financial aid possibilities and worked well because of that fact.

“We were actually sitting in Patrick’s garage, and we were talking about how we had met all of these awesome people, and we wished we had documented those conversations,” said, Nerses Aposhian, a USC alumnus and co-host of “The Founder Hour” podcast. “So that’s when we came up with the idea — why don’t we just start a podcast?”
Since November 2017, “The Founder Hour” has released five episodes that each tell the stories of local entrepreneurs. Photo courtesy of Nerses Aposhian.
“The Founder Hour” is a podcast that features conversations with L.A.-based entrepreneurs about their backstories and how they built their businesses. The show was created by Aposhian and fellow USC alumnus Patrick Tanahan. Both graduated in 2014.
The cofounders chose to pursue a podcast to tell these stories because of its growing popularity as a medium, and because of its convenience. 
“A lot of people just don’t have the time to sit down and visually look at something, but when they’re at the gym, or when they’re driving in traffic, or they’re cooking something at home for their kids, or whatever it may be, they can just throw [the podcast] on and listen to it,” Tanahan said. 
The first podcast of “The Founder Hour” debuted on Nov. 6 with an episode featuring USC alumnus Dee Murthy, who founded the apparel brands Five Four and Young and Reckless. Since then, the podcast has released a total of five episodes, and it currently has about 1,000 regular listeners. 
Although similar podcasts that interview entrepreneurs exist, the co-hosts say that “The Founder Hour” sets itself apart from others  stories of people who are still in the process of building their businesses, rather than stories of founders whose companies have already become large and successful. 
“Some are companies that people have heard of, some are probably not, but they’re companies that you will eventually hear about,” Aposhian said. “And for us, that’s awesome because we’re interviewing people that are doing it right now. So that maybe in 10 years, when you look back, you’ll be like, “Oh yeah, I heard about that company on ‘The Founder Hour.’”
The podcast focuses specifically on L.A.-based businesses, an important feature to Tanahan and Aposhian, both of whom grew up in the area. 
“There’s just so much going on in L.A.,” Aposhian said. “Just by itself, it’s like its own country.”
Because they feature local startups Aposhian and Tanahan are able to interview the subjects in their own offices. By visiting interviewees in their environments, the co-hosts can personalize the podcast. 
“There’s something special about being able to physically sit down with them,” Tanahan said. “I hear a lot of podcasts that are done over the phone, and the authenticity sometimes isn’t there. [With ‘The Founder Hour,’] it’s raw conversations — nothing is scripted, nothing is manufactured.” 
Ultimately, the pair hope their podcast helps listeners realize that pursuing their ideas isn’t as hard as it might first seem. 
“When you graduate from USC, it doesn’t matter what major you are or what you want to do. It’s very hard sometimes to see that light at the end of the tunnel,” Aposhian said. “But when you hear these stories, and when we sit down with these folks, they’re very human, they’re just like me and you. They didn’t do much differently besides being passionate and being motivated.”
Tanahan and Aposhian have aspirations to grow the podcast beyond its digital audio form. In the future, Tanahan said that they hope to have gatherings and host community building events to bring people together around a unified spirit of entrepreneurship. 
Aposhian said he wants to draw in more USC students, especially those who are interested in founding their own businesses, to the podcast. Since the show puts listeners into the shoes of these founders, they are able to get a better perspective of what their future could be like, he said.
“I feel like if I had listened to these stories, or knew about these stories or these founders while I was at USC, I might’ve taken a different path right after USC,” Aposhian said. “I think it’s just very eye opening, and that the information is now readily available, I think that’s a huge benefit.”

Schedules packed with filming, stacks of scripts, delicate camera equipment — Mary Bronaugh deals with these on a daily basis. Bronaugh, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, has been creating the first season of Ensemble, a comedic mini-series that features diverse characters and is centered on the dramatic ongoings of the college theatre community.

Labeled as “faster-paced and less self-deprecating than Glee, and less cheesy and more self-aware than High School Musical on its website, Ensemble communicates the competitive atmosphere sometimes found in the performing arts through “mockumentary-style confessionals.”
Bronaugh conceived the idea for the show last year in class, and with the help of approximately 200 people from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the USC School of Dramatic Arts and USC Thornton School of Music, she was able to transform her dream into reality. 
“Everyone was willing to start trying things,” Bronaugh said. “People just ended up getting involved because everyone wants to work on projects. That’s one of the benefits of going to a school like this.”
The production team has encountered several bumps while working on Ensemble due to a lack in funding, Bronaugh said. However, with fundraising through Indiegogo, an online crowd sourcing campaign creator, as well as help from family and friends, the team has been able to raise money effectively and efficiently so far. 
To fund for the rest of the first season, the team received financial support from Undergraduate Student Government.
Bronaugh assembled a team of interested students to create Ensemble. One producer, Maya Vyas, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, originally became involved with the project as a production assistant to learn more about the process of show development. 
Initially, Vyas was only looking for a learning experience and was excited to take any opportunity to get a closer look at content creation. However, she quickly fell in love with the project and took on a bigger role in the show’s development process.
“I wanted to take a stab at some more responsibility,” Vyas said. “Mary took a liking to me and started to give me more opportunities to test my work.”
Another show runner alongside Bronaugh, Lexie Chu, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, is the lead series producer. Chu’s passion for theatre prompted her to become involved with the production of Ensemble. 
“I was so excited to jump on this project because I lived and breathed theatre all throughout high school,” Chu said. “With Ensemble, it was a great opportunity to bridge the gap between theatre and TV, two of my favorite things.”
The development and production process for the show has been an ongoing effort for approximately one year. The members of the team are constantly faced with new challenges  and obstacles to overcome.
“While the process can be exhausting, such a thorough method ensures the best final product for the show,” Chu said.
However, the team agrees that putting in all of the hard work is rewarding when the end result is considered.
“Some of us have been working non-stop on the project since last January because we want to see the project through to say that we made something cool, funny and meaningful,” Chu said. “We’re so excited to have a visual product that hopefully makes people laugh.”

According to the study, which was published last month, fake social media account bots are responsible for promoting e-cigarette usage as healthy despite evidence that proves otherwise. Photo courtesy of Jon-Patrick Allen.
A USC-led study found that automated social media accounts have been found to promote falsehoods that may be detrimental to public health, according to USC News.
The study, published last month in the Journal of Medical Internet Research Public Health and Surveillance, was spearheaded by Jon-Patrick Allem from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Emilio Ferrara and Sree Uppu from USC Information Science Institute and Nancy Cruz and Jennifer Unger from the Department of Preventive Medicine of the Keck School of Medicine.
The team’s research focused on tweets and posts about e-cigarettes.  It found that in comparison to real, human users, social bots, or unmanned accounts that generate automated messages, advocate specific ideas or promote products using artificial intelligence collected on the web. They were almost two times more likely to discuss the idea of electronic cigarettes as a method of quitting traditional smoking, a claim unsupported by research.
The study analyzed Twitter accounts, through hash tags related to e-cigarettes. To differentiate between human users and fake accounts, the researchers looked at technical components such as metadata, Twitter activity, follow count and level of human emotion within posts. 
They analyzed about 2.2 million Twitter posts from December 2016 to April 2017, according to USC News. 
“This idea that fake accounts are perpetuating this unproven idea [about e-cigarettes] is potentially problematic to health at the population level because [of] … these individual narratives,” Allem said. “If you look at our research in the past, we talk about this kind of organic advocacy, which is in essence these individual stories that resonate with the public about the kind of call to action on health.”
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, people between the age of 18 and 24 are more likely to use e-cigarettes than adults.
Jourdyn Lao, a sophomore studying health promotion and disease prevention studies, attributes these claims to the common practice of using e-cigarettes and its general perception as being “cool” among youth. 
“I think that e-cigarettes also aren’t being regulated very well by the FDA and no one really knows what’s in the chemicals being vaporized,” Lao said.
According to USC News, funding came from the federal government, National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products. As a general research aim, Allem said he uses data from online social systems to gain insight into improving population level health with a large emphasis on tobacco usage and behavior.
“I think the overall point is that fake account social bots have been shown to manipulate individuals in the political arena [and] in the political context,” Allem said. “Ours is one of the first studies to show social bots promoting such big health ideas in the health domain. Ultimately, I think the next step would be to find out who is behind the automated accounts.”

After a disappointing Cotton Bowl loss, one pressing question lingered in the minds of Trojan fans: What will happen to Sam Darnold? On Wednesday at 4:16 p.m., the redshirt sophomore quarterback posted a video on Instagram stating his intention to declare for the 2018 NFL Draft. 
He was followed to the NFL by fellow offensive playmakers, juniors running back Ronald Jones II and wide receiver Deontay Burnett. 
“After talking to my immediate family, very close friends, and many people who have helped me throughout my life, I have made the decision to declare for the NFL Draft,” Darnold said in the video.
Darnold went on to say that he is thankful for the coaches and mentors who have helped him better his life both off and on the field.
“The people who have been involved in making me the man I am today have prepared me for the life and decisions that I have to make in the future,” he said.
Through that mentorship, Darnold has proven himself as one of the elite quarterbacks that the NCAA has to offer. After taking over as the Trojans’ starting quarterback in the fourth game of the 2016 season, Darnold tallied 3,086 yards, 31 touchdowns and a Rose Bowl victory. The following season, he recorded 4,143 yards and 26 touchdowns but couldn’t mark his second bowl game win. It was the first 4,000-yard passing season in USC history. 
The USC quarterback’s Instagram announcement was posted just minutes after UCLA QB Josh Rosen also declared for the draft. 
Darnold was not the only record-setting Trojan to announce his departure. A fellow backfield member, running back Ronald Jones II, also declared for the NFL Draft just two days later.
“Because of the prayers, love, and support of so many people, I feel I am genuinely ready for the challenges and successes of the NFL,” Jones said in a letter announcing his decision. 
Jones arrived at USC from McKinney, Tex., in 2015 and made his presence felt immediately. He led the team with 987 rushing yards — the most ever for a freshman in school history.
Affectionately referred to as the “Texas Tesla” by fans, the speedster upped the ante in his sophomore year, eclipsing the 1,000-yard mark and earning All- Pac-12 second team honors.
In his third and final campaign, a bulked-up Jones rumbled for 1,550 yards, with 19 touchdowns, making first team All- Pac-12, alongside Darnold. Jones ran for over 100 yards on nine occasions this season, including a 216-yard performance against Arizona State and a 140-yard game in the Pac-12 Championship.
Always a home-run threat during his career with the Trojans, “Rojo” finishes his career as the fifth all-time rusher in USC history. He is currently projected to be a second-round pick by many draft analysts.
Deontay Burnett emerged as one of Darnold’s favorite targets, with a breakthrough performance in the 2017 Rose Bowl (164 yards and three touchdowns). In his junior year, he proved to be more than a one-hit wonder, as Burnett led the Trojans with 1,114 yards receiving and nine touchdowns. 
“The NFL has been a lifelong dream of mind and I feel I am ready to take on this next challenge in my life,” Burnett wrote in a Twitter post. 
Replacing Darnold, Jones and Burnett will be a difficult task for the USC coaching staff moving forward. Darnold and Jones alone combined for over 80 percent of the team’s total offense in 2017. 
At quarterback, freshman Jack Sears and redshirt freshman Matt Fink will likely compete for the starting quarterback position, alongside incoming recruit JT Daniels. The five-star Daniels was originally a member of the 2019 class, but recently announced his intention to reclassify and join USC by Fall camp.
Losing Burnett will be a major blow, but the next Trojans’ starting quarterback will not lack offensive weapons to throw to. Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. combined for 1,213 yards receiving in 2017. 
 Replacing Jones at running back should also be a relatively clear-cut process. Freshman Stephen Carr showed flashes of brilliance in his debut campaign, despite being hampered by injuries (363 yards, three touchdowns). Meanwhile, redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai displayed a bruising physical, running style with limited carries (261 yards, 5.3 yards per carry). They are joined by the more experienced Aca’Cedric Ware, a junior running back. 
“My sincerest thanks to all of my coaches and teammates at the University of Southern California,” Jones wrote. “I am truly going to miss you guys. Go win that national championship for me next season.”
Darnold is no better than the rest of the players who come to USC for being prepared for the NFL. Loyalty is not a word
in their vocabulary for leaving early especially with two years left of eligibility. Darnold was lame in the two big losses with
ND and OSU, and needs another year to learn how to hold onto the football, and prevent stupid throws to the other team.
Burnett is also not pro ready at this time. Jones !! is understandable with really nothing to gain coming back.

Despite a 12-point deficit going into the half, the women’s basketball team overcame No. 16 Oregon State to claim its first victory of the regular season. The Trojans struggled to keep pace with the Beavers offensively in the first half. However, the Trojans’ defense came alive, flipping the momentum of the game and allowing the Women of Troy to finish with a 65-61 victory.
While the whole team stepped up its defense after the half, it was junior guard Aliyah Mazyck who stood out. Picking up the guard early and laying on heavy pressure, Mazyck forced three consecutive turnovers. 
“I’m really proud of the kids,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We’re down fifteen points and I told them, we just have to grind. Halftime was just positive. Coach Glover made a great adjustment putting Aliyah on the point guard and then we got great defense from Sadie [Edwards], Minyon [Moore], and Kristen [Simon], Jordan [Adams], they all played really, really well.” 
The turnovers added fuel to the growing spark of senior forward Kristen Simon’s free throws, ultimately leading to a 12-0 run for the Trojans that would take them within four points of Oregon State by the end of the third. Even though it was neck and neck for most of the fourth, the change of momentum at the end of the third energized the Trojans through the end.
“You could feel it,” Trakh explained. “You could feel them not cutting as hard … I can’t tell you how well-coached that team is. It’s extremely well coached and I have to give credit to our kids that we disrupted them a little, but you got a sense that we got some easy baskets and we got some steals, some layups, that got us going. It was really important.”
With Oregon State shooting 50 percent from the 3-point range to USC’s 28.6 percent, it was clear that the Trojans were going to have their work cut out for them in the second half. Even though Simon, who finished the game with 21 points and seven rebounds, was putting away shots in the paint, the Beavers’ seven 3-pointers were making it difficult to catch up. However, the Trojans never lost hope.
“Of course we were a little down because we were down by 13, but one thing I know about our team is that we don’t give up,” sophomore guard Minyon Moore said. “We don’t really see numbers, like we see we are down by 13, but we still play like it’s a close game. Our team doesn’t get flustered or nothing like that. So, halftime was just our Coach Erica Hughes said ‘Forget about the first half. It’s a new half. Go out there and play your game.’ And, I think we did that and executed down the stretch.”
Senior guard Sadie Edwards added 17 points in the victory. 
“We made an adjustment, we stayed together, we stayed in it,”  Edwards said. “We could have dropped our heads getting down by fifteen points at one point, but we believe in each other and our coaching staff believed in us.
In the end, it was the Trojans’ defense that changed the momentum of the game, but it was the team’s perseverance that brought the Women of Troy the victory. After Moore’s free throw granted her team a 2-point lead with 29 seconds remaining, the Trojans’ defense kept the Beavers out, forcing them to foul. Oregon State would only be disappointed when Moore converted both free throws to seal the deal for the Trojans. 
“I think moving forward, we needed to get a win,” Edwards explained. “and now, I think more importantly, we’ve got experience. Down the stretch we executed, we got stops and scores and I think that’s huge for us moving forward.”

It’s hard to believe there was a part of the season when the USC men’s basketball team held a No. 10 rank.

Since the start of the season, the team has fallen to 11-6, taking losses to ranked and unranked opponents and is on its way out of the top 25. To be fair, it’s been a wild season of NCAA basketball so far, with teams like Kansas and Kentucky tumbling into double-digit rankings after dropping major losses both at home and on the road. Last week alone, three of the top five teams fell to unranked opponents, completely shifting the rankings yet again. 
While it might be a topsy turvy season for the country as a whole, the Trojans have themselves to blame for their sudden and furious descent out of the national rankings. 
The team entered the season with a full return of a talented crop of starters bolstered by several fresh faces. Before the first tip-off of the season, it appeared that the Trojans’ NCAA run of last season might continue and expand this year. Months later, even head coach Andy Enfield, who is known for standing by his players, seems at a loss.
“I usually take the blame for losses, and obviously every game goes on my record as a head coach,” Enfield said after an 81-88 loss to Washington. “But tonight, I was very disappointed in some of our upperclassmen, defensively. You can blame me for not motivating them or getting them to play up to their capability. They have to go home and look in the mirror and come back and play better basketball if we’re going to have a chance to win games in this league.”
The easiest way to analyze any team’s failures is to study its losses. Most often, the Trojans struggle when they dig themselves into a hole by allowing their opponents to build up a lead, often failing to reclaim it. In four of its six losses this season, USC entered the half with a deficit, launching a valiant comeback attempt only to fall slightly short. 
Win or lose, the Trojans typically score less frequently in the first half than in the second, a habit that isn’t uncommon for any team, given that defense is best played with fresh legs. However, the team’s underperformance in the first half has been a consistent issue. Even in victories over teams such as New Mexico State, USC often enters the second half with a tie or a razor-thin lead.
Part of this deficit can be attributed to shooting. The Trojans are currently shooting below 50 percent from the field, but they have especially struggled against ranked opponents, highlighted by a dismal 28 percent performance against Texas A&M. Despite averaging 14 trips to the line per game, the Trojans have struggled similarly with free throws, failing to deliver in close-game situations. The team missed 10 of its 21 free throws in a loss against Cal. 
At first, they weren’t necessarily bad losses. Dropping to now-No. 11 Texas A&M is not necessarily worth mourning, and falling to wonderkid Trae Young and now-No. 7 Oklahoma is a similarly manageable loss. 
But the meltdown against Princeton, which resulted in a 10-point overtime loss at home to an unranked Ivy League team, followed by a home loss to Washington burst the bubble that USC belonged at the top of the NCAA. This weekend’s heartbreaker against Stanford reflected the truth — the Trojans just don’t have it this season. 
“We should’ve taken care of business,” senior guard Jordan McLaughlin said after the team blew a 15-point deficit to lose to Stanford. 
The captain repeatedly described the loss as “tough,” emphasizing how difficult it was to lose on a buzzer-beater shot. Yet he didn’t seem to have an answer for why the Trojans still haven’t learned to hang onto a lead.
The main issue with this team lies in the fact that even though the Trojans are winning games, they aren’t winning by enough to convince anyone of their dominance. Four of the team’s 11 victories have ended with single-digit leads. Winning by 5-point margins over teams such as Middle Tennessee and New Mexico State simply won’t cut it. 
Although the Pac-12 isn’t the power conference it hoped to be at the start of the season, boasting only two top-25 teams, it will still provide consistent competition for the Trojans as they attempt to rebuild and salvage this could-have-been season. With a 2-2 record, the team sits in the dead center of the conference rankings. However, no Pac-12 team is undefeated in conference play even this early in the season, and no team in this conference is unbeatable in any way.
Perhaps the brightest light of this season so far has been McLaughlin, who averages 12.9 points and 7.8 assists per game. Although McLaughlin isn’t the team’s leader in points or steals, he remains the heartbeat of the Trojans on both offense and defense, and in big-game situations, he’s the leader that the team desperately needs. 
Whether it’s notching 19 assists against UC Santa Barbara or putting up the would-be game-winner against Stanford, McLaughlin has proven his worth as the senior captain of the squad. And this is his team to turn around as the Trojans continue into conference play.
Their Final Four dreams might be distant, but for now, a conference title is a promising and achievable goal for the Trojans.

The No. 12 USC men’s volleyball team traveled to Honolulu for the Texaco Rainbow Warrior Classic last weekend.
USC handily won its first two matches against two Division III programs: Juniata College and Stevens Institute of Technology. However, a hosting Hawaii team reasserted itself as the king of the island as it swept USC to win the championship. The Rainbow Warriors handed the Trojans their first loss of the season.
The Men of Troy kicked off the tournament on Thursday against Juniata. In the match, USC secured the upper hand early and never looked back. They jumped to a 7-0 lead in the first set, then recorded 10 unanswered points in the second set. Trojan redshirt junior outside hitter Jack Wyett led the team with 14 kills, five digs and an ace. USC outperformed Juniata in every major team statistic, paving the way for a 3-0 sweep with scores of 25-19, 25-9 and 25-21.
The following day, USC faced Stevens. Similar to the first match, USC cruised in the first set by building an early 5-0 lead and ultimately finishing the set 25-17. In the second set, USC rallied from a 17-21 deficit after freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis left with an ankle injury. The Men of Troy were led by a star performance from junior outside hitter Ryan Moss, as he added a career best of 21 kills along with seven digs, three blocks and three aces. The Trojans concluded the match victorious with a score of 3-1 (25-17, 27-25, 22-25, 25-18).
No. 5 Hawaii validated its ranking by sweeping USC on the tournament’s final day (17-25, 20-25, 22-25). The Trojans’ 4-0 start was not enough for them to claim the first set, as Hawaii responded with six unanswered points to steal the lead. In the second set, it was Hawaii’s turn to open with an early lead. The Rainbow Warriors scored five unanswered points out of the gate and continued to outscore the Trojans throughout the remainder of the match. A major part of Hawaii’s success came by doubling USC’s hitting percentage from .479 to .207. Sophomore outside hitter Gianluca Grasso contributed 13 kills plus two digs while Lewis sat out due to his ankle injury.
USC’s overall record now stands at 3-1. The Men of Troy will go on the road to No. 5 UC Irvine on Friday, followed by a Saturday home game against UC Santa Barbara at the Galen Center.

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
As a journalist, I can often fall into a slightly false sense of familiarity with athletes whose careers I cover for a long period of time. It’s easy enough. After all, we see these young people — our peers, at least in age — crying or laughing in the locker rooms after games, gritting their teeth through major injuries, promising improvement or revenge. It’s easy enough to feel like, along the way, we come to know these athletes as people, not just as a players.
With Sam Darnold, this is especially true. Last year, the Daily Trojan was the first publication to cover the new quarterback phenom in depth, and I spent hours talking to Sam, along with coaches and teammates. 
In the process, I ended up spending hours in an interview with his parents, Chris and Mike, in their home in San Clemente. Most journalists know that there is truly no easier way to glean background information for a story than to talk to a young athlete’s parents, and the Darnolds were everything you would expect — patient and compassionate, humble yet full of pride for their son.
The few hours I spent with them made me feel like I actually knew this one-day first-round draft pick beyond just a few sheets of statistics. In around four hours, I collected enough adorable stories about Sam to fill an entire issue of Daily Trojan — and believe me, I tried to convince my editor to dedicate a whole 16-pager to those anecdotes — and along the way, I stopped looking at him as solely an athlete. 
One story that Sam’s mother told me especially stuck with me. There was no conceivable way to work it into my already-way-past-word-count feature, but I still attempted to jam it in several times before giving up. Chris didn’t cry when she talked about the Rose Bowl, or the NFL, or anything else football-related at all. But she cried when she told me this one, about the bravery of her sixth grade son. 
When Sam was in sixth grade, he had a best friend, Cole, who had multiple sclerosis. The pair was playing basketball — Sam’s first love in sports — with a group at recess when several older boys approached them and ridiculed Sam for letting Cole play. Sam squared his jaw and replied, “He’s my friend.” He stared the older group down until they shied away.
An aide told the story to Chris, and she cried when she heard about her son’s loyalty. It was something that couldn’t be taught, she said. He was fiercely loyal — to his friends, his teammates, his coaches. For the past two years, we saw that same loyalty toward head coach Clay Helton, toward his offense, toward our school and our football program. 
Every single one of his teammates spoke of Sam with a mix of awe and pride. He was a perfect team player, they said, a shy guy who led by example and lifted up those around him. We saw it even in that dismal route in Arlington, as he walked the sidelines talking to his receivers and praised his teammates in postgame interviews.
Sometimes, it got exhausting. After all, the offense this season had its flaws, and it could get tiresome to hear a quarterback defend his team and coaches with such vigor, even when they were clearly letting him down. But every time that Sam defended this program, I saw the same little kid who had stuck up for his friend on the playground — fiercely loyal, perhaps to a fault, but always unwavering.
It’s easy enough for fans to wax poetic about team loyalty and the courage of those athletes who choose to finish what they started with their college programs. Many will claim that it’s in those athletes’ best interests to stay and get their degrees, to fulfill the college education that exists as the purported “pay” for a college athlete.
But the truth of the matter is that Sam doesn’t owe USC anything more than he has already given. In fact, he’s given this school just as much as it gave him. Nothing reflects that truth more than the Cotton Bowl. 
In his final game, Sam took nine sacks, often brutal and often preventable. He threw a boneheaded interception, but made up for it by doubling Ohio State’s passing yards and slicing apart the secondary to eat up the field. But nothing that Sam did could make up for the lack of all the other factors — pocket protection, clock management, receiver receptions — that could have turned the corner to create a comeback. He tried, but he wasn’t enough on his own.
In the end, I think that Sam’s final chapter at USC feels like such a heartbreak because we were all rooting for him. Yes, we wanted the team to win. We wanted the redemption of reclaiming national championship caliber, and all the glory that would follow in its stead. But we also wanted Sam to win it all, and we knew he could do it.
At the start of the season, I bought into all of the hype. Hook, line and sinker. If anyone asked me, Sam Darnold was going to win us the Pac-12 Championship and the National Championship and the Heisman to boot. And as the season dragged on, I wondered — was I really wrong? Was he not that good? Was it all a fluke?
With the pain of the last season finally fading, I’ve come to see that we were all right. On any given season, Sam could’ve been that guy for us. It wasn’t our year, perhaps, but that’s not his fault. It’s also not his fault that he couldn’t give us the goodbye we wanted, especially on his own.
And even though he didn’t go out in all of the blazing glory that we had hoped for him, I know that as the years pass, this school will remember him at his heights — scrambling out of the pocket, slinging bullets past Penn State’s triple coverage and sprinting down the sideline of the Rose Bowl with his helmet held high.
For Sam, USC will always be here. So will the Trojan Family.
