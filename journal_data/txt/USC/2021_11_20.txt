Senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson has history with USC. Thompson-Robinson had started two games against the Trojans in his career before Saturday, throwing for over 350 yards and 4 touchdowns in each game. His record in those games? 0-2.
Now, in his final season at UCLA, Thompson-Robinson had one more chance to make his mark on the crosstown rivalry game and he didn’t disappoint. The Trojans had no answer for him or the rest of the UCLA offense. USC lost 62-33, its first loss to the Bruins since 2018 and the most points the team has ever given up to UCLA.
“Those last two years stuck with us a little bit,” Thompson-Robinson said. “I couldn’t be more proud of these guys. ”
The lopsided scoreline wasn’t the only embarrassment on the day for USC. After Thompson-Robinson ran in a second-quarter touchdown to put UCLA ahead 28-10, his momentum carried him toward the stands, where a young USC fan got him to sign a UCLA hat. He was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the shame of an opposing player dishing out autographs in the middle of the game was enough to deflate the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“It was definitely spur of the moment,” Thompson-Robinson said. “When you see a kid handing you a hat and a pen, [it’s] second nature to grab it. I was glad to make that kid’s day.”
Thompson-Robinson redeemed himself over the course of the game after throwing an interception on UCLA’s first two offensive drives. He found his rhythm and started hitting his receivers downfield in the second quarter. He finished the game 16 of 22 for 349 yards with 6 total touchdowns, 4 passing and 2 rushing.  
“We talked to him about not flinching,” Head Coach Chip Kelly said. “He’s a special player, and I’ve said it since the beginning. He’s as tough as they come, both mentally and physically, and that was on display today.” 
USC didn’t go down without a fight. After a UCLA missed field goal, freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart found sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. on two-straight deep passes, the second of which went 44 yards and a touchdown in the middle of the third quarter. A failed 2-point conversion kept the Bruins up 35-26, but there was life in the Trojans. 
That was, until redshirt junior wide receiver Kazmeir Allen swiftly took the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. Allen was untouchable on the day, dicing open both the USC secondary and special teams unit. He tallied 215 all-purpose yards and 3 total touchdowns. 
“It hits you a little bit,” said Dart about the kickoff return. “But we had a big play two plays later, so [we] didn’t really feel it as much. I just wish we would’ve capitalized on that drive, and who knows what would’ve happened.”
Dart’s first USC start had some electric plays but wasn’t enough to keep the Trojans in the game. He finished 27 of 47 for 325 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. 
“This was a game we had highlighted on our schedule,” Dart said. “It didn’t go the way we wanted, but it is what happened, and we gotta move on … I wasn’t able to do enough to come out with the win.”
USC showed some fight in the face of adversity, but a myriad of blown coverages, penalties and wasted opportunities defined the team’s sixth regular season and fifth conference loss. The Trojans gave up 609 total yards of offense, the most they’ve allowed this season. 
“They capitalized on a lot of the mistakes we made today, and we didn’t capitalize on the mistakes they made,” interim Head Coach Donte Williams said. “Every time the momentum swung in our way, they did things to, all of the sudden, swing it back [their way]. You can’t win a football game giving up 600 yards on offense, I don’t care who you play.” 
The hectic nature of the rivalry game defined the first quarter both on the field and the sidelines. Kelly got an unsportsmanlike conduct call, and UCLA also picked up a sideline interference penalty. USC picked up the slack by committing penalties for the remainder of the game, as the Trojans dished out 79 yards on 8 total penalties.
The fans at the Coliseum shattered the season attendance record, with 68,152 filling the seats. By the end of the game, it was the traveling UCLA fans and band making most of the noise. 
“We’re just not playing together,” redshirt senior center Brett Neilon said. “It just seems tough to get all three phases playing together at the same time … Maybe it’s just the culture that’s been established here, but it just seems like the same old story this year.”
USC must win both of its last two games to qualify for a bowl game. The Trojans will stay at home to face No. 14 BYU in their next game Saturday Nov. 27.

Women’s soccer ended its NCAA tournament run in a penalty shootout loss at the hands of Penn State after finishing 2-2 during regulation at home. Despite clawing back from a deficit twice during the match, the Trojans bounced out of the postseason’s second round. 
USC conceded the opening goal in the 20th minute when senior Kerry Abello reached the end of the byline before lobbing the ball to redshirt junior forward Ally Schlegel who scored from a first-time strike ebbed away to the goal. 
The Trojans responded four minutes into the second half when senior forward Penelope Hocking received a pass from freshman forward Simone Jackson, cut outside of the box and chipped a strike past the goalkeeper. Hocking notched her 12th goal of the season and third since coming back from injury against UCLA. 
The Nittany Lions promptly responded eight minutes later when senior midfielder Sam Coffey headed a pass into Schlegel who sprinted past the defense before converting her brace. Schlegel, who scored Penn State’s goals, added to her 8 goals on the season. 
USC mustered a late equalizer in the 85th minute when Jackson collected a pass from junior midfielder Croix Bethune and swiftly belted a shot toward the far post that successfully evaded Penn State’s goalkeeper. The All-Pac-12 second team and All-Freshman forward added to her impressive rookie season as she converted her fifth goal of the season. 
The Trojans bowed out of the NCAA tournament on penalty kicks after missing their first penalty and eventually lost 5-3 to the Nittany Lions after regulation time and two overtime periods. 
“I thought we were dangerous. I thought we were active. I thought we put [Penn State] on the backheel for much of the game,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in a postgame interview. “I thought we created enough to win the game.”
The Trojans were backed by fans at the Soni McAlister Field who were energized by Jackson’s equalizer in the final minutes of the second half. 
“I can’t thank the fans enough for coming out today. I wish we had moments like this more often,” McAlpine said. “As the season grew, we had more fans come, and I think that is a testament to the way the team plays and the energy they play with. People enjoyed watching this group play, and I’m proud of that, I’m glad for that and, hopefully, we created fans that will be back a lot more.” 
USC’s regular season set program records with an 11-game win streak and 15-game unbeaten run. The Trojans finished second in Pac-12 standings with an 8-1-2 record and remained undefeated until the last fixture against UCLA. 
“You talk a lot about building something that’s sustainable, building something that has a standard to it, and we’re still climbing,” McAlpine said. “This group really set a new bar, really knocked down a couple of barriers that we’ve had as a program … I’m really proud of this team and this season.”
