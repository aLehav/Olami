They are the few, the proud, the straight-from-work.
They strut through the glass doors, custom gear in tow, while employees greet them by name, lowering their heads in deference.
They are the mighty Shatto Knights and they are damn good at bowling.
A recreational league that competes on a weekly basis, the Knights come to Shatto 39 Lanes to hang out, not to sip artisan martinis. They don’t follow a fancy dress code or expect trendy DJs like their Hollywood counterparts — they simply bowl.
Part bowling rink, archaic diner, dark bar, billiards hall and noisy arcade, the alley combines the brown linoleum aesthetic of a Los Angeles Unified School District high school built in 1952 with the washed out colors of Napoleon Dynamite. Though the eclectic players inside have their own unique stories, they are united by a love for bowling. If The Dude lived in Koreatown, he’d bowl here, comfortably lounging in a bright orange chair in front of signs that read “Bowl for Fun and Health.”
Trendy top-40 tunes blast on the speakers, and regulars eye newcomers suspiciously, keeping their favorite lanes on guard; teenagers stand ready to defend their favorite Street Fighter machines.
Frequent Shatto-goers  include Amie Lieberman, a sophomore at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising studying product development who has pink streaks in her hair. Since she joined the Knights in May with her best friend, she finds beating others is her favorite stress relief.
Her bowling partner, makeup artist Traci Raffelson, joins Lieberman every week.
“It’s so fun and it’s something I look forward to. And it’s cheap,” Lieberman said.
The pair visit the alley so often that the management gave the two their own bowling shoes. Lieberman, of course, adds her own style: gold spray paint and pink laces.
The patriarch of the group is a majestic, gray-haired man who has his own audience that sips beer as they watch him warm up. Julio Herrante, a toolmaker, started bowling 15 years ago with his wife and children. Now, he comes to continue practicing his skills. He brags, in slow English, about the seven tournaments he has won, flashes his silver ring from a Vegas tournament and points proudly to the spot on the wall that commemorates his highest score, 289 — two pins away from perfect.
These are details of what bowling should be: a strange, grimy anachronism that serves as haven for the tired and common; part of the relaxed Los Angeles lifestyle punctuated by gutters and strikes — a meditative, carefree activity enjoyed by everyone.
Three miles away is a modern version that threatens the integrity of, to use the parlance of our times, bumming around. Lucky Strike Lanes at L.A. Live, a bar-club-lounge-bowling-alley monstrosity, threatens the innocence and charm of local low-key bowling.
Bowling at Lucky Strike is considered “cool.”  The alley’s lack of direct lighting gives way to projections of up-and-coming artists, the latest music and sophisticated cocktails. Though the progression from cheap date to hip activity makes sense — the popularity of The Big Lebowski and slick marketing no doubt helped the company — it’s no surprise bowling is cool enough to warrant celebrity birthday bashes featured in InStyle and People magazines.
Lucky Strike’s first location in Hollywood even owes its bar to the now-demolished Hollywood Star Lanes, the site where The Dude, Walter and Donny hung out in the movie. The countertop was Hollywood Star Lanes’ seventh lane. As a wise man once said, sometimes you eat off the bar and sometimes the bar eats you.
Instead of fries and hot dogs rotating in a machine, the lounge serves chicken pillows, flat iron steak and country corn hash with grilled shrimp. With pretentiously small plates come a gradiose dress code; one that prohibits athletic wear, sweats, plain white T-shirts and ripped or soiled clothing, among other items.
The Dude would not be welcome here.
Luxury bowl lounges don’t just limit themselves to Hollywood; there are two other Lucky Strike locations in Los Angeles County, as well as similar companies like 300. Such places are only the lonely bastard child of an American tradition loved by regular California folk. These lounges just seem like a strange, sexy version of an evangelical religion steeped in tradition that have suddenly become fashionable, like Kabbalah.
Comparing Shatto and Lucky Strike is like driving through any major LA neighborhood; each one includes elegant three-story houses a mere mile from gang territory. Such juxtaposition doesn’t just manifest itself in sudden changes in the quality of the highway asphalt, but in the price of bowling shoe rentals. The mere existence of these two opposite but parallel establishments characterizes the binary nature of the Los Angeles spirit, the fusion between the trendy and the comfortable, the cheap and the chic.
Ultimately, both alleys have smelly shoes and offer the same simple sport; just two undeniably LA spins on the same thing.

Pop culture has suffered many tragic hits in the last several months.
The King of Pop. The sunny face of the original Charlie’s Angels. The most convincing infomercial salesman. A high-profile DJ.
Triple threat · Swayze, who died Monday at age 57, starred in several cult classics, including 1991’s Point Break with Keanu Reeves (right). - Photos courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox
And now, the shamelessly sexy dance teacher who taught Baby to finally let go.
On Monday, three-time Golden Globe-nominated actor Patrick Swayze lost his life to a 20-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
Though Swayze first became a household name as an ’80s heartthrob and, later, built up an eclectic résumé with roles in classic cult films, Swayze was a bona fide multi-talented performer.
The son of choreographer Patsy Swayze, who owned a dance studio in Houston, Swayze literally grew up in the dance world, studying several styles at his mother’s studio. He later  moved to New York to complete his formal ballet training at the Joffrey Ballet School. Before the spotlights of Hollywood beckoned, Swayze was drawn to Broadway, leaving the ballet realm to star as Danny Zuko in a production of Grease. It was the first time Swayze blended together his passions for dance and acting and, as a 30-year-long film career followed, it wouldn’t be the last.
Here are some of Swayze’s most memorable on-screen performances.
Dirty Dancing (1987)
While nobody puts Baby in the corner, Swayze’s Johnny Castle ain’t no wallflower, either. Another seemingly cheesy film in the ’80s dance flick repertoire, Dirty Dancing was initially set to have a one-week theater run and then go straight to video — until a shirtless Swayze sashed his hips onto the screen, literally sweeping actress Jennifer Grey off her feet. Dirty Dancing marks Swayze’s breakthrough film role and solidified his status as a charismatic and bankable leading man.
Ghost (1990)
After a slew of critical bombs, Swayze stated that being typecast was his biggest fear. This personal pressure to try something new led Swayze to Ghost, the early ’90s tearjerker that also starred Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. Swayze won over audiences with his tender sensibility in his portrayal of a recently deceased man trying to warn his lover of possible danger. The film also earned Swayze his second Golden Globe nomination.
Point Break (1991)
Swayze again avoided typecasting by taking the unusual role of Bohdi in Kathryn Bigelow’s bank-robbing action flick, Point Break. As a grungy, beach-blond, bank-robbing surfer, Swayze stole the show from then-rising star Keanu Reeves and instantly achieved cult icon status.
Donnie Darko (2001)
It’s famously rumored throughout the halls of the USC School of Cinematic Arts that writer-director Richard Kelly modeled Swayze’s self-absorbed motivational speaker after renowned film professor Drew Casper. Though Kelly has repeatedly denied the claim, Swayze’s perfect tan, tight-fitting polo shirts and animated manner of speech is quite suspicious. The truth aside, Swayze’s role adds a burst of life to this terribly depressing indie drama.
The Beast (2009)
The A&E television series, which aired for only 13 episodes, was Swayze’s last on-screen performance, one he tirelessly filmed while enduring chemotherapy sessions. Swayze’s turn as a veteran FBI agent ensured that his long, fulfilling career would end with a bang.

In movies, music, art and television, there are no such things as good ideas.
Well, there are, but a good idea is one you hardly remember. Great ideas, however, are the ones you’ll never forget.
For Vans Warped Tour creator Kevin Lyman, his great idea has been able to clutch  the single-best luxury that most other concerts will never be fortunate enough to achieve: longevity.
With more than a decade and a half’s worth of history, Vans Warped Tour will celebrate its 15th anniversary at a one-night theatrical event Thursday.
The two-hour movie screening in select theaters will feature recorded performances from popular Vans Warped Tour veterans such as NOFX, Ozomatli, Pennywise, Rise Against and Underoath, as well as behind-the-scenes clips and special footage tracing important tour memories.
“The film’s lineup really encapsulates the 15 years of the tour. It’s about respecting the past and embracing the future,” Lyman said. “People sometimes see the Warped Tour as one-dimensional, but our goal is [to] surprise viewers with the range of musical talent.”
Throughout the years, Vans Warped Tour has evolved from a pursuit of taking nameless performers on the road to becoming a full-fledged cultural phenomenon. Lyman expressed that the “sense of discovery” first-time tour-goers feel during their first “warped” experiences has kept it going for this long.
Dating back to 1995, the year of the first Warped Tour, Lyman rallied bands that he had met throughout his career working in clubs. The first show featured acts mostly unknown at the time.
“I loved music, and I knew that I didn’t want to become ‘that guy’ who became burned out by it,” Lyman said. “I spent 12 years trying to build respect within a culture, but before moving on I decided to try one more thing with my friends.”
Though the tour’s first year garnered only modest reviews, Warped fever soon caught on.
“A lot of people didn’t attend, but for those who did, they loved it,” Lyman recalled.
In the tour’s second year, Vans joined in as a permanent partner, forever fusing skateboarding culture and the world of rock music. Surpised by the tour’s potential for commercial growth, Lyman has watched his idea morph into a highly anticipated annual event that not only serves as a platform for emerging artists but stands as a defining movement for youth within music culture.
Aside from the more than 50 non-profit organizations that have emerged as a result of the tour, Lyman has also witnessed growing opportunities for young entrepreneurs to get their big break — just as he did. Young fashion designers for clothing brands such as Hurley and Glamour Kills have found success building their businesses alongside the Vans Warped Tour.
The Vans Warped Tour’s contribution to modern popular music is also evident in its 15 years of operation. Lyman’s tour has been instrumental in pushing names like No Doubt, The All-American Rejects, Blink-182 and Katy Perry to the vanguard of mainstream music. If it’s the Vans Warped Tour that showcases up-and-coming bands to the world, it is Lyman’s job to continue making the next discoveries in music and bringing something new to fans each year.
“I hope when people come out of the theaters after seeing the scope of our 15 years, they will leave with same shock value or appreciation for what we try to do each year, which is something new and totally different,” Lyman said. “It’s amazing, but I had no idea the Warped Tour would become what it is today.”

Trying to round out his coaching staff as the basketball season approaches, coach Kevin O’Neill announced the addition of assistant coach Tony Miller via Twitter early Wednesday afternoon.
Miller, who was recruited heavily before college to play football at Division I programs such as Colorado, Michigan and Ohio State, instead chose to play basketball at Marquette for then-head coach Kevin O’Neill.
Miller’s tenure as point guard for the Golden Eagles during the early 1990s made Marquette a force to be reckoned with. He helped to lead his team to the Sweet Sixteen in his junior season, only to fall to eventual national runner-up Duke.
Marquette finished as the runner-up in the National Invitational Tournament during Miller’s senior year.
His record for career assists remains the most in Marquette history and ranks him seventh all-time in the NCAA.
After a successful collegiate career, Miller played for teams all over the globe, including two stints in Amsterdam, which netted him two Holland national titles.
O’Neill, who has only been on Twitter for three days, has already used it to make his first big announcement of the season and round out his staff.

USC has placed itself in a great position to run the table in the Pac-10 after winning a huge Ohio State game in its second contest of the season.
Sound familiar?
Shattered dreams · Former USC cornerback Cary Harris collapses in anguish after Oregon State shocked the Trojans in 2008. This year’s Trojans look to avoid the same mistake against Washington this week. -  Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
Well it should.
Last year, the Trojans beat the Buckeyes 35-3 in Week 2 at the Coliseum and appeared to have passed their toughest test of the season with ease.
Following the victory, USC was ranked No. 1 and had no true Pac-10 threat that stood in the way of an undefeated season and a ticket to the national championship. After all, the conference was supposedly in a “down year.”
The rest looked easy.
On paper.
After riding high for a week, the Trojans lost 27-21 on the road in their next game to an unranked Oregon State team led by then-freshman running back Jacquizz Rodgers’ 186 rushing yards and two touchdowns.
The story on USC’s website read: “Trojans Stunned.”
It was shocking for everyone, to say the least.
After an awful first half in which the Trojans found themselves trailing 21-0 heading into the third quarter, USC fell short in a late rally.
It was a disappointing loss following one of USC’s biggest regular season wins in recent seasons.
Enter the 2009 Trojans.
There are many similarities between last season’s victory over Ohio State and this season’s.
The win over the Buckeyes was once again huge — maybe even more meaningful considering this matchup was in Columbus and Matt Barkley proved he’s not your typical freshman quarterback.
And although the Pac-10 is stronger this season and USC has three tough opponents on the road in Oregon, Cal and non-conference foe Notre Dame, the Trojans have arguably already defeated their toughest opponent of the year.
More similarities:
Just like last year, the Trojans will open Pac-10 play on the road following their big win over the Buckeyes.
Just like last year, they will be facing an unranked opponent against whom the Trojans are favored by 20-plus points.
And just like last year, the expectations of players, coaches and fans for the team couldn’t be higher.
But USC’s staff is hoping that unlike last year, the Trojans will not have a letdown.
“I didn’t do a good enough job last year,” USC coach Pete Carroll said of preparing his team. “We didn’t play as well as we could have [against Oregon State]. And hopefully we’ll capture what it takes and do well by this time.”
This time, the Trojans face the Washington Huskies.
And this time, the Trojans won’t embarrass themselves.
Here are my three reasons why the 2009 Trojans won’t suffer the same fate as the 2008 team.
1 . This game isn’t being played in Oregon.
It’s no secret that the Trojans have had trouble playing in Oregon throughout the last several years and last season was no different.
In fact, losing in Oregon is nothing new for USC.
In my three-plus years as a student at this university, the Trojans have yet to win a game in the Beaver State.
The 2006 team was upset by the Beavers, 33-31, in Corvallis. In 2007, the Trojans fell in Eugene, to the Ducks, 24-17. And then there was last year’s debacle.
For some reason or another, the Trojans have failed to show up when they’ve traveled to Oregon in recent years.
Luckily for them, this game is in Seattle.
2 . Last year’s letdown.
If there’s any positive the team can take out of last season’s loss to the Beavers, it’s that it won’t make the same mistake. Carroll said he has used last year’s loss as an example to keep his team on its toes.
“I think it was that obvious that we could [look at last season’s loss],” he said. “[We] didn’t have that example going into that game last year.”
This time around, Carroll can literally show his players how a team can’t afford to lose focus following an emotional victory as last year’s squad did at Oregon State.
All week long, the coach has been saying his players have to respect the preparation process for every single matchup, whether they’re playing Ohio State or the Little Giants.
3 . The numbers game.
Every statistic favors the Trojans here.
The Huskies are coming off the first 0-12 season in Pac-10 history. And although former USC assistant coach Steve Sarkisian has taken over as their head coach and quarterback Jake Locker is healthy, Washington isn’t expected to contend this year.
Additionally, Carroll owns a 7-1 record against the Huskies — USC hasn’t lost a game against Washington since his first year on the job in 2001.
Since that time, the Trojans have outscored the Huskies, 282-112. That’s an average score of 40-16 in favor of the Trojans each game.
All signs are pointing toward a USC victory.
And the Trojans hope those same signs will continue pointing toward an undefeated season after Saturday.

True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley was unable to throw at practice Wednesday, but the USC coaching staff did not rule out the possibility of his return and refused to name a starter for Saturday’s game at Washington.
Barkley attempted to throw before practice but struggled with the lingering pain of a bone bruise in his right shoulder suffered in last Saturday’s game against Ohio State. Redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp once again took all the first-team snaps and would be the Trojans’ primary option if Barkley is unable to play.
In line · Corp took first-team reps for the third time this week. - Eric Wolfe| Daily Trojan
USC coach Pete Carroll refused to put a timetable on a decision, preferring to wait to see if Barkley would be able to throw at today’s practice before making the call.
“We don’t want to blow it out here in practice trying to see if he could throw,” Carroll said.
Corp, who was not made available to the media Wednesday, showed few ill effects of a broken fibula suffered before the season. One of his passes was intercepted by junior cornerback Marshall Jones during the scrimmage portion of practice, but the Villa Park, Calif., native showed his trademark scrambling ability that helped catch the coaching staff’s eyes in the spring.
“He’s 100 percent, his knee is fine,” quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates said. “He’s running around and throwing, so he’s fresh.”
Because of the nature of Barkley’s injury, Carroll said there was nothing that the coaching staff could do but let time take its course.
“It’s obvious that it’s still sore,” Carroll said of Barkley’s shoulder. “There’s not a whole lot they can do for him other than ice it.”
u
Quarterback Mitch Mustain spent portions of Wednesday’s practice punting, a quirk Carroll installed after watching the redshirt junior kick the ball playfully last Friday in preparation for Ohio State.
Mustain still needs time to prove himself, Carroll said, before he could become a threat for playing time.
“We’re giving him a couple weeks to see what he looks like,” Carroll said. “He’s got a really good leg, so it’s a matter of getting his timing down.”
USC ranks second-to-last in the Pac-10 in punting with a net average of 32.6 yards per punt. Carroll has cited his disappointment with the unit’s production through the first two games, prompting him to reevaluate redshirt junior Billy O’Malley’s status as a starter.
O’Malley remains in the lead for the position, but junior Jake Harfman, who handles kickoffs, is also in the competition. Carroll said he would make a decision about the position after watching film today.
u
Taylor Mays did not participate in contact drills Wednesday, but Carroll said the senior captain’s health will be evaluated later to determine if he can play against Washington.
Mays suffered a mild sprained knee against Ohio State but is attempting to make his return in his home state of Washington.
“We’ll give him every chance to play on Saturday,” Carroll said.

For seven seasons Steve Sarkisian stood alongside Pete Carroll on the USC sidelines, coaching the Trojans during one of the most dominant periods in the school’s history.
This Saturday, however, Sarkisian, now the head coach at Washington, will be looking across the field at the man who gave him his first big-time college coaching job when the Trojans take on the Huskies in Seattle.
Shared wisdom  · Steve Sarkisian (left), the play-caller for the Trojan offense for the past two seasons, brought many of the lessons he learned from Pete Carroll to his new head coaching job at Washington.  - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
“From a personal standpoint, it’s exciting,” Sarkisian said. “You think about seven years of my really young coaching career I’ve spent with Pete. I’ve learned so much not just from an X’s and O’s standpoint, but from just an overall standpoint of how to handle situations not just with yourself, but with the football team, with your peers as coaches.”
Carroll hired Sarkisian as an offensive assistant in 2001, Carroll’s first season at USC. Sarkisian became the quarterbacks coach in 2002 before leaving for a year  for the same job with the Oakland Raiders in 2004. He returned to USC in 2005 and was named offensive coordinator in 2007.
Washington hired Sarkisian in December along with former Trojans defensive coordinator Nick Holt to turn around a team that went 0-12 last year. The Huskies already look improved, playing No. 11 LSU close in their opener and defeating Idaho last week to snap a 15-game losing streak.
“It’s exciting to watch Sark and Nick and all the fellows up there get this program underway, to get their first win, and get the monkey off on the back of the program,” Carroll said. “It’s a major accomplishment.”
Sarkisian has taken Carroll’s emphasis on competition, as well as large parts of his offensive and defensive schemes, and has tried to implement them with the Huskies.
“We brought quite a bit. I think I’d be a fool to come up here and try to reinvent the wheel,” Sarkisian said. “The preparation process that Pete has assembled there is one that has withstood the test of time. Obviously we have our own wrinkles to things, we have things that we have to do differently to fit our personality and my own personality, but ultimately, they’re very similar.”
With Sarkisian and Holt less than a year removed from the Trojan program, both teams will enter Saturday’s game with inside information on how the opposing coaches game plan.
“They know a lot about us. We know a lot about them. I don’t think anybody has an advantage,” Carroll said. “But it’s really fun, it’s fun from our vantage point because it has to be very detailed and intricate subtleties of the adjustments that we’ll do and they’ll do.”
Sarkisian, though, offered a word of caution about trying too hard to predict what their opponent would do.
“You know, we’re trying our best here not to get caught up in overanalyzing this thing too much and getting into a situation where we could get some paralysis by analysis,” he said. “If we start looking too far into this thing and trying to mind read and looking three, four steps down the road, we can get ourselves in trouble.”
Despite all the game planning and scheming, both coaches are looking forward to the chance to go up against one another.
“There’s nothing I’ve liked more than playing against people that I really love, and friends and people that I’ve worked with,” Carroll said.
“It’s exciting,” Sarkisian added. “Hopefully as we get moving forward here and as we continue to improve as a program, it will kind of shape itself up to become kind of a fun, friendly rivalry.”

Over the past few years USC has vastly improved in accommodating more students in on-campus housing. Once students are inevitably shooed off-campus, however, they continue to be plagued by unreliable landlords.
USC currently only guarantees undergraduates two years of on-campus housing. Every year, an average of 800 students who apply for campus housing are denied. These displaced students, and the thousands who didn’t even bother reapplying for on-campus housing,  are forced to search off campus for accommodation.
Clearly, availability is a problem. The university’s ambitious Master Plan is one way in which USC hopes to resolve the issue; the plan aims to provide the North University Park campus with 7,600 more beds. Though this is an impressive number, officials don’t plan on breaking ground until 2010, at the earliest.
In the interim, students turn to local landlords for housing options. Though there are many reputable landlords off-campus, several leasing companies have prompted criticism from students  for subpar service. First Choice Housing, one such provider near USC, has been the target of complaints about poor customer service. Many students will also remember the notoriously ill-served Conquest Student Housing, many of whose buildings were ceded to USC last year when Westar Associates purchased them.
If USC has the power to intervene in off-campus housing, why don’t they do so more often?
In fact, there is little USC can legally do to mediate between students and landlords. Instead,  the university is in the process of developing a program of endorsing certain off-campus complexes through a process of accreditation. The program, which will not launch until the fall of 2010, is a necessary addition to the student housing search.
USC cannot legally intervene for its beleaguered students; the next best thing it can do is try to hold non-university housing companies accountable.
It is in both the university’s and the students’ best interests to introduce this program as expeditiously as possible. It is a commendable effort in policing the off-campus housing market, and we can only hope it becomes a useful tool in the housing search. Ultimately, it is the university’s task to secure safe and affordable housing options for its students, on- and off-campus.
USC Housing can help students by not discriminating against or lying to them. Guaranteed housing for two years? Really? That’s not what I was told. Housing claimed they didn’t guarantee housing for anyone. Clearly I wasn’t the ‘right’ kind of student.

Economically speaking, it is more profitable to let those who cannot afford health insurance die, but that philosophy is highly reproachable in a moral society. I support universal health insurance; individual rights, however, must be considered in any such plan, which leaves a government-run program a dangerous option.
A government option will likely lead to a single-payer system with the government as the only provider of health care insurance, which is not entirely bad in itself. While politicians say the government option is supposed to drive down the price of health care, this will most likely not be the case.
For example, if an unbeatable competitor (the government) enters the bread market (health insurance) selling bread at a much lower price, he does not drive down the cost of wheat (health care).
Instead, the new unbeatable bread seller temporarily runs a loss by offering bread at a price below his wheat costs while other competitors (private insurers) fail to sustain such losses and go out of business. This is all to say that although the price of bread will be lowered temporarily, the new competitor has failed to address the actual cost of wheat, resulting in high wheat costs with only one bread seller.
If our health care insurer becomes a single-payer government entity, individual rights concerning lifestyle choices will not accurately reflect the cost of these people to the health care system.
The United States spends approximately $2.1 trillion on health care annually. Of that, more than 30 percent of direct costs (and as much as 75 percent indirectly) are attributed to alcohol and smoking — this doesn’t even include obesity.
Obesity, alcohol and smoking increase health care costs tremendously, as each risk factor has diseases directly related to it and could increase the risk of other illnesses, whether minor (the flu) or severe (cancer).
The unhealthy consumption of alcohol, food and tobacco is an individual’s choice up until the point of addiction. But a single-payer system overlooks this fact by making health care a public good.
When creating public goods, governments attempt to tax the users of that good the most. For example, taxes on gasoline and car registration fees pay for roads because those purchasing gasoline and registering vehicles are the same ones using the streets. Conversely, a sales tax on iPods would not apply.
With health care as a public good, however, people do not pay based on how much they need, but rather on how large their income is. The proposed health care funding method resembles an income tax.
Poorer people tend to have poorer health because of their inability to pay health insurance and medical bills; thus, they need more coverage in health care. But lower-income brackets will pay less for their health care than higher-income brackets.
Because health care reform looks to provide health care to those that cannot afford it, this construct ostensibly makes sense. But the funding method overlooks the individual rights of Americans, such that lifestyle choices are not accounted for in the funding methodology.
The use of alcohol and tobacco is an individual right enjoyed by people since our nation’s founding (with the exception of the failed Prohibition era). It also lies within someone’s personal right to eat fast food and never exercise.
Those who exercise and refrain from alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food are far less likely to encounter health issues, whether indirectly or directly linked to those health factors. It is therefore unjust to charge everyone for the health care costs that actually relate to a specific person’s individual choices.
Health insurers do generally charge those who live healthy lifestyles less. But the public good scenario puts the government in a position to force people who make healthy personal choices pay an inequitable fee to ensure other people’s rights to smoke, drink, eat unhealthy foods and generally not take care of their bodies.
To rectify uneven expenses, it is in the government’s best monetary interest to charge those with less healthy lifestyles more money through substantially higher fees on alcohol, tobacco and “unhealthy” food, as arbitrarily defined by government.
The government should make a substantial effort to insure every American and lower health care costs in general. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal established a great program in his state that is lowering health care costs tremendously by increasing completion among insurance companies, and augmenting hospital competition and transparency. While this system does not cover everyone, something similar could easily be adopted across the US to decrease costs.
Universal coverage must be attained, but not at the expense of individual rights. If both parties will stop playing politics and actually get some intellectuals to help them out, health care reform can be realized in an efficient manner.

Unless you’ve been hiding out in a spider hole in Tikrit for the last couple of days, chances are that the backlash from Kanye West’s MTV Video Music Awards meltdown has found a cozy home in your inner ear with no departure date on the horizon. Saturating the airwaves with the voracity of a freshly awoken infant, the firestorm caused by Kanye’s absurdity has threatened to shake the nation to its very core — or so it seems.
Throwing economic woes, health care reform criticisms and fantasy football deficiencies to the wind, the acceptance speech from hell has made a ridiculous ascent to the top of the national agenda. From teachers to classmates to your friendly neighborhood transient, it seems that nearly everyone has an opinion on the matter — everyone, including President Barack Obama.
Katie Kittrell | Daily Trojan
As reported via Twitter by the intrepid journalists over at ABC News, the president of the United States called the rapper a “jackass” for hijacking Taylor Swift’s once-in-a-lifetime moment at MTV’s award ceremony. The comment was made during a casual conversation that took place while the news crew was setting up for a hard-hitting interview.
After realizing what he had said, the president was quick to implore those in the room to keep the comments private.
Whoops.
With news of the president’s quote spreading throughout the sphere of information, suddenly people who wouldn’t know the difference between a VMA and a VCR were chiming in about how inappropriate it was for Obama to have made such a profane statement.
Ironically, President Obama’s comments chastising West actually helped to deflect some of the collective vitriol away from the scorned rapper. Nevermind the fact that the president was under the impression that his comment would be counted as off the record. This is not an article about shoddy journalistic morals.
As explicitly listed in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution, a person is only eligible to assume the Oval Office if he or she is a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old at the time of his or her presidency and a resident in the country or its territories for at least 14 years.
Check, check, check.
Outside of that, there is nothing that stipulates that the president of the United States should have the temperament of a Sunday school teacher.
So why the fuss?
If in fact it turns out that the commander in chief has the mouth of a sailor, it’s not the worst thing that could happen. We still put full support behind these purported “potty-mouthed” defenders of freedom from which the idiom is derived; it seems rather silly that we should think that this casual use of profanity would impair the president’s ability to do his job or make him any less of an upstanding citizen.
This isn’t a freedom of speech issue, either. Clearly, if that were the case, Serena Williams, Sen. Joe Wilson and West would all be on the next bus to San Quentin.
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion and can voice it at whatever time they find themselves compelled to do so. Barring treason, conspiring statements, slander and, say, threats to slam tennis balls down the throat of a line judge, the consequences that such pistol-mouthed orators face are limited to disdain from peers and the court of public opinion, shameful regret and some pithy monetary fine. These pale in comparison to the harsher sentences handed down to brazenly outspoken individuals throughout history.
Then what is this an issue about?
Obama’s arduous job requires 24/7 attention and dedication. But he is also human.
In the interest of dispelling any notion of a double standard, perhaps its fair that “jackass” has come to reach a level of notoriety close to that of “you lie” in the past week. But in comparing context and tone, there is a clear difference. One is a story because it disrupted a nationally broadcast presidential address. The other is a story just because the president became an inadvertent national broadcast.
The bottom line is that there is a time and place for everything. Obama’s speeches are so carefully crafted that it would be absurd to even think that there could be room for an F-bomb, or that the commander in chief is liable to bust into a profanity-laced tirade in tense talks with world leaders.
But in the fractions of the year in which President Obama can afford to let his guard down a little bit, it shouldn’t be cause for talk of the apocalypse if he happens to let a couple of swear words into normal conversation.
Wait. Before you start to come back with a rebuttal, I’m really happy for you, and I’m gonna let you finish, but Obama had one of the most harmless passing comments turned pointless national stories of all time. Of all time!
Seriously.
