This semester saw the creation of the USC chapter of the National Organization of Business and Engineering, which aims to bring together students from the business and engineering fields and is the only organization of its kind at USC.
NOBE was founded at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and now has chapters at other schools such as Purdue University and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
USC’s chapter hopes to unite students from the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business, because it believes the relationship between the two is vital.
“All businesses incorporate technology, even on a superficial level,” said Alden Mitchell, NOBE treasurer for the USC chapter and a freshman majoring in electrical engineering and economics. “Technology companies, such as Google and Apple, that are predicated on the success of their technology are contingent on being able to carry out business processes.”
The organization believes students from the two fields should come together because their roles are becoming more intertwined. Mitchell said technology services and companies such as Apple rely on engineers to build, construct and think of the projects, but they still need to sell the products, which makes businesspeople necessary.
“Engineers are interested in business because it’s a great place to get into having a technology background,” Mitchell said. “Businesspeople in turn can see what and why engineers are learning. I think this mutual understanding could be very beneficial to them.”
Michael Soh, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering and the president of the USC chapter of NOBE, learned about NOBE through a friend. After contacting the national organization, he set up the USC chapter with two of his friends.
The USC chapter has attracted about 25 members to the new organization.
The chapter will be hosting workshops and networking events, where Mitchell hopes students will acquire the skills that are used in both the business and engineering fields.
It is the promise of these events that encouraged Amy Rasplicka, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, to join NOBE.
“I’m really looking forward to networking events because I’d like to try to get an internship as soon as possible,” Rasplicka said. “They plan on bringing professionals to speak to us and I think that would be really helpful.”
The organization’s first major event will take place Feb. 28, when a speaker from Qualcomm will talk about the integration of business and engineering.
The chapter has events lined up every week for the rest of the semester, and it just received recognition at the national level.
“Now that we’re officially recognized, we will have access to the national online database,” Soh said. “Students will be able to upload their résumés for others to see.”
In the long term, the USC chapter aims to add to their list of corporate sponsors, which currently includes the education company Kaplan, Inc.
“Especially for an organization like us that claims to provide professional experience, we need to have corporate interaction,” Mitchell said. “We’d love to be in a position where our corporate sponsors see the vitality and potential of our group and support that. I don’t think that will be particularly hard once we get more members and connections.”

Monish Tyagi and Logan Lachman were declared the winners of the Undergraduate Student Government presidential election Tuesday, according to preliminary results.
Celebration · President-elect Monish Tyagi (right) and Vice President-elect Logan Lachman celebrate their victory Tuesday night at the Conference Room in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. They received 38.84 percent of the USC student vote. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan 
Tyagi, USG director of campus affairs, and Lachman, a greek senator, won with 2,230 votes. Eric Burse, president of the Black Student Assembly, and Andy Greos, Program Board production director, came in second with 1,707 votes, followed by Alex Fadil and Rohan Mehra with 1,646 votes.
“It’s incredible. It’s such an honor to have that many students come out and vote and say that they support us,” Tyagi said. “This is, by far, the greatest honor I’ve ever received from my peers, and I can’t convey enough how excited I am.”
Tyagi said they plan to focus on “tangible changes that students want to see” during the next school year.
“I’m looking forward to sitting down with Chris and getting to work,” Tyagi said. “The amount of respect between the candidates was unparalleled, and we really ran a great race.”
Tyagi attributed his win to his ticket having the most USG experience, adding that he and Lachman are excited to begin the transition process.
President Chris Cheng said he thinks the winners’ experience in USG will help them next year. Tyagi has worked in several committees he will now oversee, and Lachman will run the Senate meetings she currently attends.
“[Vice President] Nehi [Ogbevoen] and I couldn’t be more excited to help work with them, to help mentor them,” Cheng said. “There’s a lot of hard work ahead of them, and if they show the dedication this upcoming year that they showed in the past, they’ll be more than prepared to meet out those demands.”
The other candidates congratulated Tyagi and Lachman, shaking their hands after the announcement.
“We were all out there every single day doing the best job that we could,” Burse said. “We all are excellent leaders, and I am confident that Monish and Logan will do a great job next year.”
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
The total number of votes this year increased by 23 percent from last year. Students cast 5,741 ballots, which represents more than one-third of the undergraduate student population, nearly reaching USG’s goal of 6,000 votes.
“It’s hard to pinpoint the number one reason,” said Barb Solish, Elections and Recruitment co-chair. “But, the USG communications team worked very hard to publicize the affair. I also think having the food trucks definitely, absolutely made a difference.”
Polls provided food at peak hours and enticed students to vote.
Voting numbers might also have increased because more total candidates (28) ran this year than in any of  the last four years.
“We had such a high number within the senators and different groups reaching out to their constituents that we really saw students reaching out to different groups on campus,“ Solish said.
The official results will be announced next Tuesday once those elected are determined to be in good standing by the Office of Academic Affairs.

Epic fail- anyone who is involved in USG at all knows that Monish is a useless piece of shit.
This just further proves that these elections are never based on merit
US(i)G(ma chi) is back in action.
Ya, because when Holden was President it worked out SO well.  If you think Monish is going to be a good President, you haven’t been a member of USG for the last few years.
TAKE USG BACK FROM THE GREEKS!
Its hard to show sarcasm via a text comment. To clarify I was being sarcastic.

With its win against No. 21 UCLA in the rearview mirror, the No. 6 USC women’s swimming and diving team has begun preparations for the final stretch, traveling to Federal Way, Wash. for the Pac-10 Swimming and Diving Championships, which begin today at the Weyerhauser King County Aquatic Center.
Finish strong · Sophomore Yumi So posted strong times in the 100-yard and 200-yard fly. She ranks in the top 25 nationally in both events and hopes to best those times to help lead USC to another dual meet win. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
This year, the women’s championships, which end Saturday, will feature six top-25 teams: No. 1 Stanford, No. 4 California, No. 7 Arizona, No. 21 UCLA, No. 25 Arizona State and No. 6 USC.
Going into the Pac-10s, USC (9-2, 4-2) has managed to obtain its most dual meet wins since going 9-1 in 1997. That was also the only year the Women of Troy won an NCAA title.
There is hope history might repeat itself, but the team has remained adamant in not relying too much on historical record.
“I don’t want to over-think it, because the past doesn’t predict what is going to happen. But our team is really excited, and I see really good things happening for us at the Pac-10 [championships] and NCAA [championships],” said senior co-captain Presley Bard.
USC is going into the Pac-10 championships with 19 swimmers who have already clocked NCAA ‘A’ or ‘B’ cuts. Junior Katinka Hosszu leads the Women of Troy with top times in the nation in the 200-yard individual medley, 400-yard individual medley and 200-yard fly, and is ranked third in the 100-yard fly.
Senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul is No. 1 in the nation in the 100-yard fly, while sophomore Haley Anderson has the top national time in the 1650-yard free.
In addition to their top-ranked positions, the three swimmers, along with other members of the team, hold records in their events as the third- fourth- or fifth-fastest in the country.
This competition also has implications for the swimmers on the team who haven’t qualified for the NCAA competition.
“This is our last chance for some of the girls to qualify for NCAAs,” DePaul said. “For about half the girls [who have already qualified] this isn’t our main focus for the rest of season.”
The swimmers aren’t the only ones participating in the competition in Federal Way. Junior Victoria Ishimatsu will compete at the Pac-10 diving competition, beginning Thursday with the women’s 1-meter and men’s 3-meter events.
USC has had a good history with the Pac-10 championships, and hopes to continue its winning traditions. It has won at least two Pac-10 titles (including diving) in three straight years and in nine of the last 10 seasons.
With the pressure on for the swimmers who have not received NCAA cuts yet, USC will head into the Pac-10s today hoping to set the tone for the remainder of its season.

This last weekend, Lakers’ superstar and five-time world champion guard Kobe Bryant became the first athlete to have his legacy cemented alongside the greatest performers in the history of American entertainment at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
Bryant’s latest honor, coupled with the noticeable karmic effect the event had on his MVP performance at the All-Star Game, got me thinking:
USC’s new $70 million athletic center is still more than 18 months away from being unveiled, but what better way to pay homage to the tradition-laden past than to create a Trojan Walk of Fame at the building’s front entrance?
Normally, the easiest way to peg a legend would be to simply count the number of shiny trophies an athlete has stocked up on his museum-esque mantels. But the rules could use a little revision.
So in making it onto my list of legends, the members of this inaugural class personify not only excellence on the field, but also illustrate some semblance of being a decent human being off of it.
Louis Zamperini (Track and Field)
The 94-year-old never won a National Championship during his time in cardinal and gold and finished just eighth in the 5,000-meter race at the 1936 Olympics, but no one exemplifies the Trojan spirit better.
From collegiate record-holder in the mile to a B-24 bombardier in WWII, prisoner of war in Osuna and eventual motivational speaker who preached forgiveness and tolerance, Zamperini is a testament to the power of unyielding faith and love.
Read about him and you are inspired. Listen to him speak and you instantly feel chills. Meet him in person and you can’t help but be moved to tears.
His mind, his wit and his unflappable appreciation for life make him the ideal first candidate to cement his place in Trojan history.
Sam “Bam” Cunningham (Football)
When looking at the college landscape today, potentially no one had a greater impact than Sam “Bam” Cunningham.
Cunningham never had the power legs of O.J. Simpson, the cutback moves of Charles White or Marcus Allen’s grace down the sidelines.
But on Sept. 12, 1970, during a time when the nation’s progress was marred by racial inequality in the South, the black fullback did all of the talking with his feet.
Playing against Bear Bryant’s all-white Crimson Tide football team, Cunningham, in front of a hostile crowd at Denny Stadium, single-handedly led USC to a 42-21 victory with 135 yards and two touchdowns.
He would never win a Heisman or shatter any rushing records, but Cunningham’s performance reinforced the transformative power sports can have on social change, as Bryant and the other racially divided SEC schools quickly began integrating their programs.
Rod Dedeaux (Baseball)
No program has had a bigger impact on creating a sense of athletic tradition on campus during the last 130 years than USC baseball.
On the surface, a man who only spent one game in the major leagues as a shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1935 doesn’t seem like an appropriate candidate to fill out my Trojan Trifecta. But as a manager for USC from 1942-1986, Rod Dedeaux was essentially the Joe Paterno of collegiate baseball.
In 44 years, it is easy to assume that at some point a coach will fall into some luck and win a championship or two, but in four decades Dedeaux didn’t just win — he transformed USC into a baseball dynasty.
Twelve national championships, an NCAA-record 1,332 career wins, a 2006 induction into the College Baseball Hall of Fame and Collegiate Baseball’s Coach of the Century honors speak for themselves, but I plan to say my piece on behalf of Dedeaux’s legacy.
The naming rights to the baseball field simply don’t do justice to one of the game’s and the school’s greatest ambassadors.
The beloved “Houdini of Bovard” passed away in 2006, but his wife Helen and their many grandchildren should be able to celebrate his life’s work with a fitting final spot in my inaugural class of famous feet.

The No. 1 ranked USC men’s volleyball team look to extend their winning streak to three at Cal State Northridge today.
Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli won both the American Volleyball Coaches Association and MPSF Player of the Week awards for his performances against Stanford and Pacific. He finished hitting .667 against defending NCAA champion Stanford with no errors, and also had no receiving or service attempts against Pacific.
Strong play · Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli was named AVCA and MPSF Player of the Week as he helped USC to two wins at home. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
“He tore Stanford and Pacific apart with his serving and hitting,” said senior opposite Murphy Troy. “I’m not surprised he won it, and he definitely deserves it.”
Ciarelli did not attend practice Tuesday, but is expected to play against Northridge (4-10, 3-6).
Troy missed the match against Pacific with the flu, but is back in full force and will be on the court against Northridge.
Redshirt freshman opposite Tanner Jansen had his first career start in place of the All-American Troy. He finished with seven kills earned at a .600 clip to go along with seven digs and three blocks.
“It’s one of our best strengths to play against such a great second team in practice every day,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “A lot of other teams can only stall the game with substitutes, but ours can win matches for us.”
When Northridge first traveled to the Galen Center in early January, they were swept 25-18, 25-17, 25-20.
The Trojans’ victory was also the first in 17 matches against the Matadors.
The young Northridge squad, however, has developed with age and shown large improvement at home. USC (8-1, 8-1) has not won in the Matadome in eight matches.
“Northridge has gotten much, much better,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “They finally solidified their lineup and the young guys now have half of a season under their belts.”
Included in the new lineup is freshman middle blocker Greg Faulkner, one of three freshman in Northridge’s starting lineup. The Matadors will also start two sophomores.
“They have a lot of new starters, kind of the opposite of us,” Troy said. “We have a lot of experience. They’ll look very different tomorrow night.”
The Trojans currently lead the MPSF in hitting efficiency, hitting at .390 for the season. McKibbin, who leads the conference in assists, averaging 12.06 per set, is a big part of that. As is Troy, who leads the conference with 4.64 kills per set.
“Northridge has gotten to be very good at digging behind one-man blocks,” Ferguson said.
In practice, the Trojans have been working on steadily adding to their attacking scheme, employing quick attacks from back-row players to keep defenses honest.
“We’re gonna be diverse to the point where we can take whatever’s given to us,” Ferguson said. “We’re gonna force them to spread out and take the middle, the pins, whatever is available.”
First serve is at Northridge’s Matadome at 7 p.m. tonight.

USC second baseman Joe De Pinto seems to be enjoying his new role in the middle of the Trojans’ lineup.
The senior took over the team batting average lead Tuesday with a 3-for-3 performance that helped lead USC (3-1) to a 6-3 victory over UC Riverside (1-3).
Leading the way · Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa has helped lead the Trojans to a 3-1 start to begin the 2011 season. USC won the first game of its seven-game road trip at Riverside on Tuesday night. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
De Pinto is now batting .643 through the team’s first four games of the season thanks to his flawless performance Tuesday evening at the Riverside Sports Complex. De Pinto reached base in each of his four plate appearances, scored twice and knocked in a run.
“Joe has really played well so far,” said interim head coach Frank Cruz. “He’s really stepped up his game and something people don’t see is that he has really helped the freshman shortstop [James Roberts] feel comfortable.”
After falling behind 1-0 in the first inning, USC responded with three runs in the top of the second inning. De Pinto scored the Trojans’ first run of the game after reaching on one of the three walks surrendered by UC Riverside starting pitcher Dustin Emmons.
An inning later, De Pinto notched his 150th career hit as a Trojan with an RBI single up the middle to score USC’s fourth run.
The Trojans added another run in the sixth inning when junior Matt Foat led off the inning with a double over the right fielder’s head. He scored three batters later when freshman James Roberts collected his second RBI of the game with a single to left field.
In the eighth inning, De Pinto created another run for USC. He laced a pitch from Mark Garcia into the left-centerfield gap and used his speed to leg out a triple. De Pinto trotted home when junior Alex Sherrod grounded out to shortstop.
The Highlanders threatened in the bottom half of the inning after USC reliever Brandon Garcia walked the leadoff hitter and gave up a pair of hits. The second hit plated a run and forced Cruz to go to his bullpen for the seventh time.
Brad Douthit entered the game, striking  out Riverside’s Eddie Young, ending the inning and the threat.
In total, USC used nine pitchers. Starter Ben Mount pitched only two  and one-third innings, allowing an unearned run on five hits.
Freshman Kyle Richter picked up his first collegiate win with one and two-thirds innings of scoreless relief. He struck out three batters while allowing two hits. Junior Chad Smith picked up his first save of the season with a 1-2-3 ninth inning.
“We were able to pitch a lot of guys and most came in and really did their job well,” Cruz said. “Three base on balls or fewer was our goal, and we were able to achieve that.”
The Trojans will head to Houston next to take on No. 22 Rice. USC will have a chance to go three games above .500 for the first time since April 2009, when they open play with a weekend series against the Owls on Friday at 2:30 p.m.

This year’s Chinese American Student Association Culture Show directors, Patrick Lefaver, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, and Nelson Li, a junior majoring in business administration, along with Technical Director Jennifer Huang, an undeclared sophomore, put their hearts and souls into “Legacy.”
Show time · “Legacy” was directed by USC students Patrick Lefaver, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and Nelson Li, a junior majoring in business administration. The show also included student actors. -   Photo courtesy of Jerry Lin  
CASA put on this intricate, well-executed Annual Culture Show on Sunday in the Bovard auditorium. The show was a completely student-run production that merged Chinese culture with the performing arts.
For nine months, the students wrote scripts, auditioned potential cast members and watched their vision come alive in what Li called their “brainchild.”
“When Patrick and I first met together to discuss the show, we agreed that we wanted to reach for the skies,” Li said. “We wanted to produce an extraordinary stage production and would accept nothing less.”
And the show itself turned out to be a well-executed and intricate performance, despite a few flaws.
The show begins with a filmed segment that lasts a few minutes. Here, the audience is introduced to the protagonist, a young Asian-American man from Los Angeles named Jason Wu (played by Andy Matsuzaki, a senior majoring in economics). Wu finds himself rejecting his Chinese culture and  trying to get away from a group of crime-ridden characters.
Once the film is over, Jason  finds himself in ancient China. As he tries to find a way back home, he falls in love with Princess Jia Rong (Beverly Chiang, a sophomore majoring in business administration) who is about to unwillingly marry the power-hungry, cruel and corrupt General Chen Hsu (undeclared freshman Kevin Ho) to honor her duty to the kingdom.
Scheming to murder both Prince Zhi Hao (Jonathan Chen, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering) and the Emperor in hopes of overthrowing the dynasty, Ho’s portrayal of General Chen Hsu brings tension and violent tendencies to the stage. His forceful physical contact was so shockingly realistic that the entire crowd seemed to gasp. Jia Rong’s parents (Martin Chen, a freshman majoring in business administration and Aydee Tie, a sophomore majoring in psychology) perfectly portray the typical persona of controlling parents.
Matsuzaki and Chiang both played their characters in a convincing way that created a genuine chemistry. Each character seemed to grow and flourish, especially when Jason’s courage became more alive when he revealed the truth about General Chen Hsu.
The plot is somewhat generic, there are a few twists that capture the audience’s attention. The more light-hearted aspects of the show, including a cross-dressing concubine, “that’s what she said” jokes and more subtle sexual innuendoes, add a tonal contrast to the dramatic and action-packed scenes.
June Wang, a junior majoring in neuroscience and music, who portrayed Wei Ming, did an excellent job speaking in Buddhist-inspired sayings as Jason’s humorous yet wise ancestor.
Wei Ming and her food-loving house workers A-Niu and A Bei (the comedic duo Daniel Tang, a class of 2009 alumnus and Irene Ng, a freshman majoring in accounting), kept the production light and fun.
The show incorporated student clubs with special performances from Traditional Chinese Dance and Wushu Nation that were incorporated perfectly in a majestic engagement ceremony for the Princess and the General.
The all-female Chinese Traditional Dance group  danced very delicately with varying footwork and simple hand movements. Wushu Nation brought intensity as each member moved around the stage with flips and hard-hitting martial arts moves.
The next two appearances, however, felt out of place. After the climax of the play and the 15-minute intermission, rising Youtube star Joseph Vincent performed three songs before the story could continue.
When Jason wakes up from his dream at the end of the performance, the dance crew Chaotic 3 comes out of nowhere and takes over the stage.
They were pumped with energy and danced an exciting routine, in the end compensating for the awkward placement and timing of their performance.
Throughout the play, some of the actors experienced some technical difficulties with their microphone headsets, such as during a fight scene between Jason and the General.
But they powered through the problems like professionals. The actors in “Legacy” dedicated themselves to their roles without any sense of fabricated emotion or lack of commitment.
With simple yet authentic furniture, colorful traditional Chinese clothing, outdoor sound effects and quick scenery changes thanks to a hard-working backstage crew, “Legacy” turned out to be more than just an average student-run production.
After hours of rehearsals, stress and sleepless nights, the directors, cast and crew pulled off a production that was thoroughly entertaining.
“They say nothing good happens after 2 a.m.,” Lefaver said. “We beg to differ.”

The Absolut A Cappella annual group singing competition was held Friday, February 18 and hosted by our very own USC Sirens, who just so happen to be the first and only all female a cappella group on campus.  Competitors included the USC Sirens themselves, Khoir Practice, Troy Tones, SoCal VoCals, Trojan Men, UCLA Scattertones and Caltech’s Fluid Dynamics.
Despite the rain, which typically tends to scare off Southern Californians with the slightest drizzle, there proved to be a good turnout in addition to an interesting series of performances.
The organizers of the evening kick-started the festivities with an angelic rendition of the Beatles’ “Yesterday” and Mariah Carey’s “Always Be My Baby”.  Both numbers were beautiful and delicate. However, they didn’t leave a lasting impression.  They were nice and that was the extent of their effect.
The Sirens then went on to perform Florence and the Machine’s “Cosmic Love” and while their efforts were valiant and there were indeed some beautifully harmonic moments, the strain in the lead soloist’s voice was evident.  When compared to Florence Welch’s brilliant, artful and incredibly unique, power-house voice, most will unsurprisngly fall flat.
The Sirens ended with a modern Katy Perry medley, which was catchy given that its core featured one of the most polarizing pop stars of our generation, yet the vocals were quite ordinary.  Though the performance was respectable, it never rose into the clouds of greatness.
There was, however, one particular Siren song that stood out – a cover of Crimson Doves’ “Running Away”. The lead vocalist conveyed extreme emotional depth and you could feel the sentiment pouring out of her, while the backup vocals expressed feelings of perfect melancholia.  The Sirens gave a fine overarching performance but their decision to close with this beautifully desolate ballad revealed them as capable performers – far more than a gathering of pretty voices.
As for the other competitors, Troy Tones, SoCal VoCals, Trojan Men and Scattertones stood out above the rest.  Troy Tones took home the award for Best Choreography, while Olivia Peet of SoCal VoCals won for Best Vocalist as she whole-heartedly embraced “Hold My Heart” by Sara Bareilles.  For Best Arrangement, the Trojan Nights performed a powerfully harmonic, emotionally moving lullaby featuring a soloist reminiscent of Andrea Bocelli.  Lastly, to the pain of many present, the UCLA Scattertones took home Best Vocal Percussion and Best Overall Group.
All of the winners were indeed deserving.  The Troy Tones provided an enthused, charismatic and stylized jazz performance, featuring coordinated chair dancing, which amused the audience with the idea of intensely dancing while simultaneously singing.  As for SoCal VoCals, Olivia Peet’s voice is so emotionally charged that you can’t help but hold out to see her on some sort of singing competition or perhaps even Broadway.  And though the Scattertones gave a commendable performance and emerged as the leaders of the pack, the Trojan Men gave a similarly entertaining and exquisitely rendered set.
Of course, there is some bias to be expected, seeing as we are on Trojan territory, but the power of our enthused and energetic, all men’s a cappella group is extraordinary. Plus, it’s nice to have a group of classy gentleman dressed in suits around who aren’t fraternity pledges.
Still, the opposition did feature a lovely and romantic Moulin Rouge medley, including “One Day I’ll Fly Away” and “Come What May”.
The two leading groups coincidentally both sang “Wavin’ Flag (Forever Young)” by K’naan and while the competitors had different takes on the World Cup number, the Trojan Men had that power-house effect that should have placed them on top.
Awards and prizes aside, the event promoted philanthropy and the organizers held a raffle which raised a couple hundred dollars for a Dominican child whom the Sirens sponsor in an effort to promote his love of music.  The musical ensemble had its ups and downs, but the show was certainly a valuable experience for those present.  Keep your eyes peeled for future showcases of all the a cappella groups USC has to offer, in order to get the best comprehensive exposure to our homegrown musical talent.

The weekend rain did not discourage committed house music fans from coming out and supporting the world-renowned DJ and producer Wesley Pentz, better known by his stage name, Diplo.
The Major Rager event, which was sponsored by JusCollege, a social networking site aimed exclusively toward college students, brought together an eager crowd of die-hard music fanatics and partygoers ready to kick off the long weekend.
As a musical innovator, Diplo has long been on the scene as a creative and highly magnetic performer, delivering all types of sounds to fans around the world.
Together with DJ Switch, as part of their collaborative brainchild Major Lazer, Diplo produces signature reggae and drum infused tracks, like “Pon de Floor.”
The show not only featured  successful performers, but took place at a unique venue. The Proud Bird airfield near Los Angeles International airport provided both the accommodations for the event and an amazing backdrop to the explosive beats of each of the featured artists.
Launching their three-city tour this past Saturday, the performers spared nothing when it came to throwing down unforgettable tracks and keeping the crowd enthralled.
Opening sets included USC alumnus Ben Oprstu and current student Tony Fresch, a sophomore majoring in music industry, who commanded the crowd with their highly energetic mixes, along with Doc P & Random Citizens, Bones and Dylan Francis, whose dubstep set roused a fiery show.
At one point, the venue felt as though it were literally on fire.
The night started off slow, however, the crowd continued to roll in as Diplo’s set grew closer, consequently creating a jam-packed dance inferno.
Diplo’s first tweet after the show read, “Wow that party at the proud bird was like 125 degrees. Thanks to everyone who sweated thru it… u guys went hard as hell.”
Perhaps the rain was a blessing, after all.
While the opening acts kept spirits high, the anticipation for Diplo’s performance was as palpable as the heat in the room.
The crowd’s sheer excitement shook the room as Diplo emerged for the final set.
Taking inspiration from top electronic and hip-hop tracks like “Warp 1.9” by the Bloody Beetroots and “Look at Me Now” by Chris Brown, Diplo took the show by storm with his unique blend of crazy, bassy beats and amazing musical collaboration that made everyone want to jump up and down.
“It was amazing,” said Daniela Baharvar, an undeclared sophomore. “I’ve never danced so much in my life.”
With a wall-to-wall, content audience, Diplo soared well beyond all expectations with his thunderous performance, leaving his fans wanting more.
“The atmosphere was electric,” said Richie Rubin, a sophomore majoring in communication. “All the DJ’s did a great job of sampling their own unique sounds and it was capped off with a mind-blowing set by Diplo.”
taking inspiration from “Look At Me Now”? He produced / made the track with afrojack…, just pointing that out. Good write-up though.

For those who haven’t tapped into the reality television world for a few years, a quick glance at the TV Guide listings can come as a bit of a shock. Survivor is still on the air?
I’ve been asking that same question every new season for the last 10 years. It’s amazing how repetitive reality shows such as Survivor and Big Brother have lasted much longer than other critically acclaimed series such as Arrested Development.
Even more surprising is that American Idol is not only still on the air, but actually doing well. USA Today reported that Idol’s most recent episode drew nine million more viewers than its main competitor in the time slot, The Big Bang Theory. Idol had 21.9 million viewers and ratings were up from the previous week, according to USA Today.
After Simon Cowell announced he was leaving last season, I expected the show to crash and burn miserably. For me, after singing talent, the show’s main draw was always the judges’ dynamic: Paula Abdul’s absentminded weirdness, Simon’s blunt and brutal honesty and Randy’s “cool-guy” attitude. Without that, the show should fall apart. Yet, as the ratings indicate, that’s not at all true.
Idol’s continued success can only lead me to one conclusion: It’s not about the music. Idol is as much a show about music as Survivor is a show about learning to survive on a deserted island. The music is what draws viewers in,  but not what makes them stay. It’s about the drama and competition.
That might seem like an obvious statement, as it’s no secret that television depends on compelling drama. Nobody would watch the show if it was just a bunch of people standing on stage singing karaoke every week. It has to be more than that.
But Idol has always made its viewers believe the show crosses over into real life and that the contestants aren’t just characters used to draw Fox ad revenue; they’re real humans with the potential to have a lasting impact on our culture and pop music world. True reality television.
Sure, there are several Idol success stories. Jennifer Hudson is an Academy Award winning actress and respected singer. Carrie Underwood has also made herself a successful singing career. Kelly Clarkson will forever be beloved as the series’ first winner. Several other singers have gone on to starring roles on Broadway. It’s undeniable that the show has done much for our culture and the pop music world.
Far outweighing the successful Idol alumni, however, are the failed ones. Apart from the few singers already mentioned, Idol success rarely carries over to record sales or extended pop star careers.
Jive Records has recently announced that it has dropped season seven’s heartthrob David Archuletta from its roster after three years. In the wake of Archuletta’s huge Idol success, his debut album reached No. 2 on the Billboard Charts. His next album, released last year, fell victim to the sophomore slump, picking up only 60,000 sales (compared to his debut’s 750,000).
Other names such as Ruben Studdard, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Taylor Hicks, are recognizable, but none have had truly successful music careers.
Last year’s debut album from the most recent winner Lee DeWyze was the worst-selling debut album in Idol winner history, debuting and peaking at No. 19 on the charts before dropping to No. 93 a week later. Yet the show goes on.
Hopefully, the show can produce another lasting and impactful superstar musician rather than perpetuating the illusion of fame that it often produces. If it fails to do so, the show should end its long run while it’s still somewhat ahead.
American Idol is supposed to be about music and drama, and if it loses either one it also loses its credibility.
Will Hagle is a sophomore majoring in narrative studies. His column, “Feedback,” runs Wednesdays. 
Taylor Hicks is doing  much better than you seem to think.  He has had three successful tours, was a big draw in the Musical Grease,  And has many concerts lined  up as we speak.  He is definitely a musician, playing guitar and a master of the harmonica.  He is a songwriter and recently joined in a Jam Band Cruise of jam band greats.  Success is not only measured by record sales.  Taylor’s excede recent winners, but he’s primarily a terrific live performer.
Thanks for the article, but fyi, it was David Archuleta’s decision to be released from Jive (the label is crumbling). His album “The Other Side of Down” managed to do a booming 67,000 in sales with ZERO promotion from the label. It’s the best CD I’ve heard in ages, you should check it out, along with his vlog “Decisions, Decisions” that explains the whole thing:

“Sleep-inducing” is not a favorable adjective in music reviews. But it is the first word that comes to mind when one is lulled into the dream-like journey through a  vast sonic universe that Montreal-based trio Young Galaxy has meticulously crafted with Shapeshifting, its strongest LP to date.
With style · Shapeshifting showcases the distinctive style of Young Galaxy and also shows off the talent of lead singer Catherine McCandless. -   Photos courtesy of Paper Bag Records 
Effusing an unbridled ambition that was lacking in its 2007 eponymous debut album and 2010’s Invisible Republic, the group’s dream-pop aesthetic has been confidently tweaked to achieve a quality that is both thrillingly inventive and consistently rewarding.
With the aid of producer Dan Lissvik, a member of the Swedish experimental pop band Studio, Young Galaxy has written a set of 11 songs that flows effortlessly and blends harmoniously to establish a unifying theme for the group’s third album.
In a move that instantly catapults him into a prestigious realm of independent music producers, Lissvik acts as the metaphorical sculptor of Young Galaxy’s new style. His ambitious vision and technical expertise provide the foundations for the band’s now- promising future.
“Nth,” the album’s epic overture, features a reversed-drum beat and spacey synths that rise out of the silence and quickly build to a bombastic level only to instantly retreat back into silence. Toying with the listener’s piqued expectations, the 30-second spot is followed by the trance-like “The Angels are Surely Weeping.” We’ve lost our e-e-e-e-ssence, singer/guitarist Stephen Ramsay wails over a sleek beat and delicate keys.
The vocals of Catherine McCandless are the true centerpiece of this album. Husky and ethereal, McCandless’ voice is as vital to Young Galaxy’s new sound as Annie Lennox’s breathy vocals were to The Eurythmics and Victoria Legrand’s are to the similarly sublime Beach House.
On “Blown Minded,” McCandless’ voice shines over a thumping bass and lone distorted trumpet as she sings, I believe there’s a meteor out there / with my name on it / hurtling through space / and nothing can stop it.
Other singers could easily be thwarted by lyrics that are so unabashedly indebted to David Bowie’s songwriting, but McCandless delivers them with an earnestness and passion that demand the listener’s full attention.
That is not to say that McCandless and the rest of Young Galaxy can’t also have a bit of fun. Its toe-tapping, synth-speckled tune, “B.S.E.,” is reminiscent of Passion Pit’s more energetic dance hits and Arcade Fire’s triumphant “Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains).” McCandless embraces the ridiculous nature of the piece and boisterously repeats the song’s esoteric chorus, Black swan event.
But in a surprising tonal shift, halfway through the song the bubbly mood is abandoned for a much more somber approach. Accompanied by rising synths and a throbbing bassline, the song builds to a conclusion so achingly poignant that you easily forgive the band for its obscure lyrics as McCandless pleads, Watch as energy / Rolls out of us on golden horns of light.
Only when the group is at its least experimental and ambitious does it seem to slip up. “For Dear Life” and “High and Goodbye” play it safe with basic guitar and synth instrumentation, McCandless’ dependably strong vocals and steady beats.
Songs like “Shapeshifting,” with its start-stop lyrics, Indian instrumentation and psychedelic ambience, however, prove Young Galaxy has not only matured with this third album but also is deserving of a spot atop the list of the most exciting dance pop bands working today.
Like its predecessors, the real wonder of Young Galaxy is that it has discovered how to ground its wildly abstract musical ideas with eternal, human resonance.

The NFL is America’s most popular sport, generating about $9 billion in revenue in the last year alone.
Super Bowl XLV was the most-watched television event in history, and the league’s financial success is only continuing to increase.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
That money, however, is threatening to tear the league apart and force a labor strike in yet another example of how the ever-expanding business of sports has made all negotiating parties greedier.
In this case, neither party is hesitant to go into a lockout because they know fans are addicted to the NFL’s product and will return in full force when games resume. The fans’ dedication seems to have become a bargaining chip for both the owners and the NFL Players Association, enabling them both to hold out for the best possible offer.
The biggest issue driving a wedge between the NFLPA and the NFL owners is how to divide that $9 billion  of revenue more evenly.
Currently, the players receive about 57 percent of the revenue, after an initial $1 billion credit is given to owners off the top.
The players union, headed by DeMaurice Smith, proposed a 50/50 split of revenues, without the initial credit, on Feb. 11. The owners countered with a 60/40 split in their favor. Both sides quickly left the negotiating table after a highly contentious session.
The NFLPA is pushing for increased financial transparency while also fighting the proposal of an 18-game season.
Owners claim that player revenue needs to be cut to benefit the future of the league so franchises can dedicate costs to international growth and player safety.
The owners’ proposal is contradictory at its core, because they are aiming for an 18-game season, which would only mean less player safety and more opportunities for injury. It would turn the NFL season into a war of attrition, leaving the Super Bowl to be played by two exhausted and depleted teams.
The quality of games would decrease as well. The owners recognize this, but keep pushing for the 18-game season because of the potential to maximize television and sponsorship revenue and increase ticket sales.
As with every negotiation in sports, it’s all about the money. The business of football is experiencing a rapid growth unlike any other sport in history. Both sides are now using the extraordinary success as a negotiating chip.
Both sides claim that a lockout would harm the on-field product, the business of the NFL and the fans for years.
Yet, neither side seems to be taking a proactive approach to reaching an agreement. They are content to head into March 4, the expected start of the NFL lockout, without a new collective bargaining agreement in place.
Unlike the NHL’s lockout in 2004, however, the NFL will return in full force despite an abbreviated or cancelled season.
The fan base is so broad, the revenue so large that fans will flock back immediately once they get a chance to do so. Because the owners and the NFLPA know this, they are not afraid to disregard fans while holding out for the best possible deal they can. They both publicly advocate compromise, but neither side seems genuinely interested in budging on their stances.
Lockout or no lockout, these contentious negotiations are only the beginning of a turbulent time for labor peace in sports. The NBA’s collective bargaining agreement expires this summer, and the MLB’s ends in 2012. The unrest will continue, all in the name of money.

Was there a point to this article? By the time we finish high school don’t we move beyond stating the obvious for writing something that has a point? Yes, football players and owners are being driven to put more cash into their pockets — the point here is?

In high school, we might have learned the bare minimum about personal finance — perhaps how to make out a check or create a budget. But sadly, not many of us learned the basics of investment.
With all the horror stories circulating about vanishing 401Ks and retirement pensions, it is wise that we, as college students, take investment education into our own hands and learn how to cultivate million-dollar nest eggs.
There are many different avenues of investment — bonds, treasury funds, mutual funds, venture capital — but a good place to start is by building a stock portfolio.
Investing in the stock market is risky, but there is  potential for high returns, particularly for those who have a long-term investment strategy.
If you begin investing in college, you will have time on your side. Compounding is that phenomenon in which a sum of money grows exponentially by a process of interest and reinvestment. The earlier you begin investing, the less money you’ll need to part with to achieve the same return as someone who begins investing later in life.
Larry Swedroe illustrated this in his book, The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You’ll Ever Need.
In essence, Swedroe says that a student at age 25 who invests $5,000 annually for the next 10 years will, assuming a 10 percent annual compound rate of return, have generated a portfolio of $1.4 million by age 65.
On the other hand, an adult who waits until age 35 to start saving the same amount of money for the next 30 years will, assuming the same rate of return, have profited only $820,000, 40 percent  less than the student’s.
Though starting your investment portfolio early is a logical approach, students must take note of a few guidelines for developing a successful investment venture.
And with our access to resources at USC, students can put those guidelines into use.
Among the guidelines we can utilize is to diversify our stock holdings as we become exposed to different industries.
Diversify across industries and across continents. People who went crazy buying tech stock in 2000 suffered severe disappointment with the explosion of the “Dot Com” bubble. They lost everything.
Realize that there will be more Enrons  and that a famine in China might wipe out the rice company you invested in, but such events will not destroy you if you have taken care to diversify your interests.  
Moreover, a passively managed fund, such as an index fund, requires less risk and is designed to match the performance of the stock market as a whole. Such a plan might therefore be more conducive to college students.
If you choose to invest in these type of funds, you do so with the understanding that it will take decades for your money to grow. You aren’t hoping to make it rich off one stock that skyrockets overnight.
Let’s say that instead of spending $50 per month on beer, you decide to begin building a passively managed, diversified portfolio. We’ll assume a 10 percent per annum compound rate, the historical average. After four years, you will have generated a little more than $3,100. But if you faithfully put the $50 in every month for 40 years, you will end up with a little more than $294,000.
Whether you join a campus investment club or want to learn on your own accord, it’s vital in today’s economy to learn to make painless investments early on. Then, you will be able to watch your paltry beer change grow into a hefty nest egg.

In the wake of Egypt’s massive protests which resulted in the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak, neighboring Libya is now in the midst of its own popular uprising.
On Feb. 15, demonstrations began in multiple Libyan cities – including Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city – following the arrest of human rights activist Fethi Tarbel. Since then, protestors have continued to call for the end of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s regime.
However, the most worrisome part of the situation in Libya compared to the recent similar uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia is that there seems to be little possibility of a peaceful resolution to the current conflict.
Gaddafi has taken a powerfully hard-line stance against the demonstrators thus far, going so far as to urge his supporters to take to the streets to fight the protestors, saying that those who stand in opposition to his government “deserve to die.”
“I will fight on to the last drop of my blood,” Gaddafi said in a televised appearance.
As a result of this tension, an estimated 300 to 500 have died so far. With the chaos continuing to rage throughout the country, even more are likely to be killed, making this a much bloodier revolution than the other recent North African clashes.
While the international news media can’t seem to get enough of these African revolutions, the Libyan situation has the potential to become an entirely different beast. With a stubborn dictator willing to do whatever it takes to protect his power and a populace determined to see him gone, it remains to be seen whether this conflict can be resolved before it escalates into something even more violent.

The NCAA will release a Notice of Allegations regarding the University of Tennessee football and men’s basketball programs Wednesday, multiple sources told FOXSports.com.
A portion of the charges stem from an alleged “failure to monitor” on behalf of current USC coach Lane Kiffin, who spent one season in Knoxville as coach of the Volunteers.
The football program has been under investigation by the NCAA for violations committed under Kiffin’s watch, which involve alleged impermissible contact made between Tennessee’s Orange Pride program and various recruits.
If Kiffin does receive a copy, as expected, he, as well as Tennessee, will have 90 days to respond.
A hearing before the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions is scheduled for June 2011, according to the report.
Mistyped my name. Sheesh.
Luckily this is the end of it for Kiffin with Tennessee. You guys are just getting started with his slimy way of doing business. Sorry.

California rock band Linkin Park was recently forced to cancel five shows on its sold-out North American arena tour due to an undisclosed illness suffered by lead vocalist Chester Bennington.
Bennington was ordered by his doctor to not perform and consequently the band had to cancel its shows in Washington D.C, Uncasville, Connect., Cincinati, Ohio, Houston, Texas, and Dallas Texas.
The Houston and Dallas shows have been rescheduled for March 3 and March 2, respectively but the other three shows appear to be permanently cancelled, with ticketholders being refunded.
Vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda apologized to fans for the unfortunate cancellations saying “It’s been a long time since we’ve played in your town, and [we] were excited for you to hear the new music and see the new production.”
Bennington also offered his sympathies and thanked fans for their understanding in his statement on the band’s website on which he wrote “I really appreciate all the notes and kind words you’ve sent my way. We really have the best fans in the world.”
All tickets will be honored at the rescheduled shows for Texas, while the other ticketholders will receive an audio download from any show on the tour in addition to their refunds.
On Feb. 19, Bennington was given clearance to perform once again so the band resumed their tour in Las Vegas, Nevada. They delivered an electrifying performance in San Diego, Calif. on Sunday night, with Bennington appearing to be at full strength.
Linkin Park will be playing a sold-out show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Calif. on Feb. 23.
