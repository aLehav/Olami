In response to the arrests of six USC students following a house party earlier this month, organizers have formed a social media movement to protest the allegedly racist treatment at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department.
The LAPD launched a full investigation into the incident on May 6.

At approximately 2 a.m. on May 3, more than 79 LAPD officers responded to a noise complaint at a student party on 23rd and Hoover streets, just north of campus.
Nate Howard, a ‘13 alumnus, hosted the party to celebrate the end of the school year.
Howard said he complied with LAPD’s directions when officers came to the house.
“Two o’clock came, LAPD came and immediately told us to shut the party down and we did,” Howard said in an impassioned speech at the rally. “As students of color, we know that whenever LAPD comes, we’re out.”
Howard said he feels he was not treated with respect by the officers and that they acted with unnecessary force.
“Now one of the officers came and confronted me, pushing me out — I know my rights,” Howard said. “When he realized that he couldn’t take advantage of me as he does probably the other black men in this community, he felt a certain way … so he pushed me and another officer pushed me, and I was handcuffed.”
Three students organized a protest in front of Tommy Trojan on May 6, and a forum between students, faculty and the LAPD occurred May 7.
Many attended the sit-in on campus to show solidarity with their fellow students. Jessica Flores, a sophomore majoring in communication who witnessed the events at the party and attended the protest in support, agreed that the actions by the LAPD were excessive.
“It was a completely innocent party. Just a bunch of people getting together celebrating, and the fact that there was a white party across the street and they didn’t say anything to that party — I think that’s wrong and present-day racism,” Flores said.
President C. L. Max Nikias released a statement on May 8 responding to the events at the party. He said he has been receiving updates from his senior staff since early after the incident.
“I had complete confidence in my leaders as they fully briefed me in advance on their discussions with student leaders and the plan for last night’s forum,” Nikias said in the statement. “I was pleased that there was an opportunity for an open dialogue and for people to express concerns.”
Nikias said that he remains optimistic about the future relationship between the university and its students.
“We are confident we will move ahead from this issue in an even more productive and positive manner,” Nikias said.
At the forum, students and the parents of the arrested students spent an hour giving testimonies of their experiences the night of the incident. They expressed their love for the university but also their desire for DPS and LAPD to respond sincerely to their concerns. During the forum, some students shouted ask about Nikias’ whereabouts.
Evan Vujovich, a senior majoring in music industry who lives in the house across the street that hosted a party at the same time, said that the police did not address his party first.
“Our party ended but we were not asked to disperse, we were not asked to go home, we were not pushed out of our party that was also peaceful,” Vujovich said. “Our party was equally loud, had at least as many people and our party wasn’t even registered with DPS.”
Protest organizers said they hope that students will begin to take notice of the power they have to change these types of situations. During the sit-in, students chanted “Create our world.”
Rikiesha Pierce, a recently graduated sociology major who helped organize the event, said the sit-in was amplified by the students’ use of social media.
“What I could say about this is that students are recognizing their power,” Pierce said. “This is huge because people pulled out their cameras and took photographs and put them on Instagram and tweeted about it and put it on Facebook.”
Jason Sneed, a graduate majoring in philosophy, politics and law and one of the students who was arrested, addressed the social media movement that helped gather interest in the event. The hashtag #USChangeMovement was a trending topic in the Los Angeles area on Twitter while the forum was still in progress.
“We’re here today based off of Facebook, emails and Twitter,” Sneed said. “If we can create a movement based on social media, how much more powerful can we be?”
 
 
I think there may be a simple solution. In scenarios like these the LAPD should let DPS take the lead and only step in if DPS can’t control the situation.
How many more times are you going to report this same story over and over?  What is the response when you read the media outlets comments that show so many speaking out saying the students need to be held accountable for their behavior? No one believes they were goody two shoes doing the right thing.  These students should be using social media to start a movement AGAINST RACISM AT THEIR OWN SCHOOL.   It is outrageous to learn that USC students are still segregating themselves according to race.  Why was there a black/Latino party and a White party?  They are sending the wrong message to the youth.   The LAPD response was not racial profiling.  Just this past weekend another 2 shootings occurred in the area.  The LAPD Capt is African American, the LAPD Cmdr. in the area is African American, the LAPD Community Relations Officer is African American and 1/2 of LAPD are minority.

USC will soon welcome a new undergraduate degree program thanks to a $70-million donation from music icons and Beats Electronics co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young, commonly known as Dr. Dre.
The Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation will cover interests in fields including marketing, business entrepreneurship, computer science, engineering and audio and visual design, according to President C. L. Max Nikias.
“The vision and generosity of Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young will profoundly influence the way all of us perceive and experience artistic media,” Nikias said in a statement. “USC provides an extraordinarily  rich academic, research and artistic environment. We are committed to encouraging our students to use their intellectual and creative resources to affect change in all segments of society. Our goal is to ensure that the academy is the most collaborative educational program in the world.”
The selective four-year program, which will include faculty from the Marshall School of Business, the Roski School of Fine Arts, the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Thornton School of Music, will focus on core curriculum areas: arts and entrepreneurship; technology, design and marketability; and concept and business platforms.
Roski Dean and inaugural director of the Iovine and Young Academy Erica Muhl said the curriculum was crafted in order to equip students with the tools needed to excel in multiple disciplines.
“The academy’s core education will create a common, multilingual literacy and fluency across essential disciplines,” Muhl said. “This ‘big picture’ knowledge and skill will equip graduates with a leadership perspective that is unparalleled in an undergraduate degree, and that will be applicable to virtually any industry.”
The students’ final year in the academy will be in an experiential setting called the Garage, where students, guided by faculty or other artists and business leaders, will be grouped into self-directed teams in order to develop a prototype over the course of the year.
“The curriculum was created to take full advantage of a newly designed, revolutionary educational space that will offer students very powerful tools,” Muhl said. ”Academy students will have the freedom to move easily from classroom to lab, from studio to workshop, individually or in groups, and blow past any academic or structural barriers to spontaneous creativity.”
Iovine and Dr. Dre both have connections to USC. Iovine’s daughter is an alumna and Dr. Dre grew up close by in Compton.
The academy is set to enroll its first class of 25 students in fall 2014.
USC is fortunate to have such a donation and program. The $70 mil could have gone to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and many have lamented that it didn’t. I only hope this program develops the talents of those behind the scenes of the music world. As an alum of USC, I thank Beats by Dre’s team for this contribution and hope at least the USC Black Alumni Assn. will be tapped to help guide this program.

USC conferred more than 12,000 degrees at the university’s 130th annual commencement celebration Friday.
Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine gave the morning’s keynote address.
Remix to ignition · Music tycoon and new academy benefactor Jimmy Iovine speaks to the class of 2014 at last Friday’s ceremony. – Efren Chuong | Daily Trojan
 
Iovine and rapper Dr. Dre announced a $70 million donation last week to the university to establish the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation.
In his speech, Iovine noted two events that changed the course of his life.
At 23, he was working as a sound engineer on Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run.
“Listening to Jon [Landau, Springsteen’s manager]’s five words — ‘this is not about you’ — became the tipping point for every gift that’s followed in my life,” Iovine said. “At that moment, I began to learn how to push aside my own personal issues and my desperate need to be right so I could focus on what was truly important.”
Iovine then spoke of his second life lesson at the hands of Napster, an online file-sharing service founded in 1999. Because Interscope relied on album sales for profit, Iovine needed a friend to remind him that “everything you know could already be wrong.”
“I was scared to death … I want you all to get comfortable with your fears, because fear is a fact of life that you can use to your advantage,” Iovine said. “Because when you learn to harness the power of your fears, it can take you places beyond your wildest dreams. Because here’s the good news: Fear has a lot of firepower.”
Zach Lindberg, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business administration, appreciated Iovine’s first lesson.
“It’s important to take on a role where you just want to gain knowledge and do the best you can for whatever organization you’re working for,” Lindberg said. “It was good to see him be so successful with that mentality.”
Iovine ended his speech by welcoming Dre to the stage and reciting lyrics from R. Kelly’s 2003 hit “Remix to Ignition.” The rapper told the crowd that he was happy to now be considered a Trojan.
“I was like, ‘Dr. Dre, he called himself a Trojan, that’s awesome!’ I thought that was really neat,” said Lindberg, who will start working with Wells Fargo in June.
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni honored USC philosophy professor Dallas Willard, who died May 8, in his invocation.
Willard outlined four questions that every person should answer, Soni said, asking graduates to reflect upon them. “What is reality? Who is blessed? Who is a truly good person? And how does one become a truly good person?”
President C.L. Max Nikias emphasized the university’s focus on service, noting that Teach for America accepted 105 USC graduates into its prestigious two-year teaching program, more than any other U.S. university.
USC awarded more than 400 doctorates and six honorary degrees: to biologist Sir John Gurdon, recipient of the 2012 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine; playwright David Henry Hwang; Iovine; university trustee Glorya Kaufman, whose November donation established the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance at USC and university trustees Edward and Gayle Roski.
Receiving salutatorian honors were Alex Fullman, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science and will use a Marshall Scholarship to study at Oxford University this fall, and Julia Mangione, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in international relations and led the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation on campus.
Valedictorian Katherine Fu, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience and minored in popular music, described the importance of graduates trusting one another for support and advice.
“Surround yourself with the people who can help,” Fu said. “You do not go forward alone. You go forward as a member of the Trojan Family.”

Possibly for the first time, it’s cool to be a Trekkie.
After an explosive re-emergence into popular culture, the Star Trek franchise is again revolutionizing science fiction and making it sexy.
Beam me up, Scotty · (Clockwise from front) Alice Eve is Carol, Simon Pegg is Scotty, Karl Urban is Bones and Chris Pine reprises his role of Kirk in the hotly anticipated Star Trek Into Darkness, the exciting, high-octane follow-up to 2009’s sensational blockbuster Star Trek. – Courtesy of Paramount Pictures
The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise returns to explore the uncharted frontiers of space in Star Trek Into Darkness. These scientific quests, however, are quickly thwarted in lieu of a more political and militaristic agenda. When Starfleet headquarters in iconic San Francisco is attacked by a terrorist, Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) steers his crew into a mission for vengeance. The film is essentially a space-wide manhunt for the mysterious villain John Harrison, portrayed by the always electrifying Benedict Cumberbatch of Sherlock fame.
Considering the triumph of the first Star Trek film, it’s hard not to compare Star Trek Into Darkness to its predecessor. In 2009, Director J.J. Abrams took the franchise to places it had not boldly gone in years. With fresh faces and special effects that could hardly be fathomed in the 1960s, the sleek revamp completely transformed the series from a stale cult phenomenon to a fresh and universal blockbuster. Essentially, Abrams did for Star Trek what Christopher Nolan did for Batman.
Unfortunately, Star Trek Into Darkness tries to outdo itself and ultimately overexerts itself in an unnecessary attempt to prove that its initial success wasn’t a fluke. It can be inconsistent, excessively complex and overstuffed with frantic action sequences — a la Michael Bay’s Transformers — at its worst. Still, it’s salvaged by its visual spectacle and dynamic characters.
During the summer months, the box offices welcome a slew of epics, and it’s essential to have a critical eye for discerning which are worth forking over the cash. The latest Star Trek flick is undoubtedly worth the price of admission despite its shortcomings. Where it sacrifices coherence and fluency, it takes determined steps to flatter fans of the original series and sets up an inevitable third film and perhaps, if Abrams is feeling particularly adventurous, a new saga.
The first Star Trek commanded attention from its tour de force opening scene, in which we witness the chaotic birth of Kirk while his father makes a noble sacrifice to save his crew from a catastrophic enemy attack. The first scene of Star Trek Into Darkness, on the other hand, is visually striking but stops there. The screen is immediately cloaked in a vibrant magenta. Two cloaked figures sprint wildly through the red wood, in stark contrast to the entirely white-clad indigenous tribe pursuing them. Kirk has led his crew on a mission to freeze an erupting volcano that threatens to completely destroy the primitive planet and — of course — something has gone awry. In terms of pulse-quickening action, the scene falls flat and it immediately recalls comparison to the flawless execution of Abrams’ first attempt.
This unease of disappointment lingers throughout the duration of the film.
The major recurring fault is over-complication. The film incorporates an overbearing amount of backstory and motivation for each character and plot point, even for those who occupy only minutes of the entire story. Abrams wants to keep the film several steps ahead of the audience and, more often than not, he muddles a story that need not be smarter than its audience.
What made Abrams’ first Star Trek film so compelling was its simplicity, and its thrill of adventure. But in Into Darkness, plot twists become plot contortions, and it becomes easier to shake your head and brush off the layers of intricacy than to untangle who is doing what and why when the action resumes. That said, Abrams deserves recognition for reinstating one of the franchise’s most revered nemeses with the deliciously cold Cumberbatch. (Revisit the Star Trek flick released in 1982 to sate your curiosity.)
Star Trek Into Darkness maintains the rich diversity of characters that give the franchise so much of its appeal. Kirk is, again, charismatically arrogant and tenacious, contrasting perfectly with the calculated and relatively emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto). The two are complemented by a talented cast that returns to play favorites McCoy (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Sulu (John Cho).
The characteristic witty banter between Spock and Kirk reignites for the sake of comedic relief, but the budding tension between the two begins to parlay into more mature themes. The foundation of friendship is tested when their opposing philosophies collide in the field.
Spock’s commitment to his companions is tested by Kirk, who questions his loyalty, and by his romantic interest Uhura (Zoe Saldana), a formerly strong female character weakened by her doubt in Spock’s ability to love. Kirk, on the other hand, finally learns lessons in humility, sacrifice and failure. Spock and Kirk share a moment of vulnerability in the end, one that softens their hard-headed resolves and allows them to acknowledge just how much they need each other.
The film tiptoes around issues of morality — Spock even offers the line “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” Abrams would do well to tap into the series’ philosophical reservoir rather than cater to action-hungry moviegoers, but perhaps it’s impossible to make science fiction cool and intellectual simultaneously. One can still hope.
In the last film, original Spock Leonard Nimoy passed the torch when he uttered the words “thrusters on full.” You heard the man, Abrams. Give the next one all she’s got.
An interesting side note on where part of the movie was filmed in at the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California.

After eight long years, the eccentric French electronic music duo Daft Punk is re-entering the electronic music fray. Their new album, Random Access Memories, was released Tuesday in the U.S. on iTunes. The effort takes  its listeners back to previous years of electronic music performances and revives the success of this legendary music pairing.
Since electronic dance music has arrested society’s interest over the a large part of the past decade, the Parisian duo, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, borrowed styles of the past and remodeled  them to produce a new fusion that today’s audience can appreciate. The final product is a unique tracklist that utilizes  popular genres of the past, such as new wave and soft rock, along with techy tunes that make this album a one-of-a-kind creation
One way in which RAM  honors the icons and legends of the disco world is by incorporating vocals in its album, including the vocals of disco legends themselves. For example, “Giorgio by Moroder” shines a spotlight on the song’s namesake, 73-year-old pioneer of Italian disco Giorgio Moroder, who describes his personal values and involvement in the evolution of music.
Perhaps the most anticipated track, reaching the Official U.K. Singles Chart just hours after being released, “Get Lucky” fosters a much more widespread appreciation for the album. With its funky grooves and hip-hop elements, the song appeals to several generations without overwhelming the futuristic details. The track is symbolic of Daft Punk’s successful attempt to bridge together the music legends of various generations into number. While Nile Rodgers represents the ear-taunting R&B music of the ’70s and ’80s, Pharrell Williams embodies the same genre of a much later era. The result is a bold, electric romance between European disco tunes and foot-tapping beats, that makes even the most resistant of listeners blast the song on repeat.
The duo wraps things the album up with the otherworldly “Contact,” a sweeping, epic track which combines bashing drums, smooth organ notes and circular synth patterns  while an astronaut narrates a panoramic view of Earth from outer space.
The duo’s decision to mix music of the past and dabble with new technology proves that the idea of the “next level” is merely an illusion.  The album attempts to go beyond the commonplace music scene, avoiding generic build-ups and drops that listeners are used to hearing from artists at major electronic music festivals.
Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times has gone so far as to call the album “cheesy,” noting that some of the tracks lack the energy and vitality of past releases. Others, such as Tom Hawking of the Flavorwire, criticized RAM’s authenticity, denouncing the duo’s collaboration with a variety of irrelevant A-list names who aren’t from the EDM movement. Ardent Daft Punk fans have praised the album’s timeless nature, declaring the blend of ’80s inflections and awe-inspiring brass the toast of the summer.
For listeners not acquainted with Daft Punk’s unique style, the tunes will sound similar, but it is advisable to take note of the lyrics, which are far more emotional than any other dubstep or house track’s. Despite the grating critiques and negative reviews, Random Access Memories can be distinguished for its daring experimental vocals and its visionary leap from the common theme of EDM.
The production sequence for this album utilized pre-digital technology that the pair worked with in the ’90s: synthesizers, vocoders, one sample and traditional instruments such as guitar and drums. The composition of these songs is layered with swift beats and countless smooth infusions of vocals and ’80s-inspired guitar pieces that mimic the groovy style of early discotheque nightlife. Each song bleeds into the next with a continuous melody that sparks relaxation, giving each track substance.
Compared to typical head-banging EDM tracks, Daft Punk’s music elicits not only energy, but soul. The style could be deemed “old school,” but the combination of Daft Punk’s legendary shuffles and collaborations with artists such as Williams generate a new appreciation for the electronic music scene.
The two-and-a-half-year-long composition process effortlessly incorporated various facets of musical personas to give a sense of wholeness to the album. Working with artists such as Julian Casablancas and Moroder afforded the duo an opportunity to shed light on their perception of soulful music by carefully weaving together their voices with the choppy stirs of computers.
As the last track comes to a close, the album  wraps up  with the sound of static, sending a message of the last “breathing” moments of life that technology withholds.
With that final touch, Daft Punk establishes a newfound outlook on music as they sift through the blur of today’s over-the-top, generic, heavy pumping beats and successfully rejuvenate their melodic songs of the past with a modern outlook of creating something old that is new again.

Movie trilogies have a bit of a reputation for being films that rely heavily on action and excitement. They’re usually big money earners, which is why the studios keep going back to the well. Pensive, well-crafted and artful movies usually stand alone, having said all they needed to say in the course of their runtime. Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy takes on both of these conventions, riding the shockwave of their collision to a truly wonderful product.

Before Sunrise came out in 1995. It was small and straightforward: two 20-somethings, Ethan Hawke’s Jesse and Julie Delpy’s Celine, meet on a train in Europe and spend the night walking around Vienna talking about love, life and falling in love in the process. Their conversation flows, fueled by both their immediate chemistry and the suspicion that they will only be together for this one night. The movie is beautiful and perfectly embodies the aforementioned single artful movie paradigm.
Before Sunset came out and is also set nine years later, revisiting these two characters and all the subsequent changes that occurred in their lives. It was a big surprise to many when it was announced, in part because it ruined the beautiful ending of the first installment. However, the wonderful interaction between Jesse and Celine made any complaints moot. The movie is essentially one long conversation between the two again, this time in Paris, and the dampened Sunrise ending was replaced by an equally compelling one in Sunset.
Before Midnight, arriving after matching the nine-year gap between the first two movies, is a continuation of their stories, and Linklater, Hawke and Delpy hit the nail on the head a third time. Again the story focuses on Jesse and Celine, this time in Greece, the course of their lives having been shaped by many more elapsed years. The movie could definitely stand alone; the ideas and issues it discusses are universal and the story, by virtue of being set nine years after the previous movie, relies on conflict independent of what happened in the previous two installments.
Nevertheless, this is not a movie intended to be watched without context. What the movie can convey by itself is only magnified when juxtaposed with the other two. Seeing them in sequence, you can see these two amazingly written characters in very different situations. (Spoiler alert: If you have not seen the first two films I recommend skipping to the end of the paragraph.) The first is in their 20s having just met, the second is in their 30s having not seen each other for many years and the third is in their 40s, after having spent several years together.
You can see their thoughts evolve and their outlooks change. Their conversations are all wonderfully rich, but it is a different conversation each time. Their evolution is obvious and the participation of Hawke and Delpy in the screenplay of the second and third movies is apparent. Jesse and Celine feel absolutely real, beyond the usual feeling of realism you find in movies, to the point that the audience begins to feel like an intruder upon this couple’s intimate conversations.
This phenomenon emerges more so in this movie than in the previous two, as Jesse and Celine find themselves combatting the sort of difficulties that face a couple that have known each other for so long; complacency, impatience and frustration. The struggle is palpable, and it is a testament to these actors for making it so real.
In truth, the issues faced in this movie might be somewhat removed from the lives of the average college student. They are by no means alien, and some certainly will hit nerves, but many of them are problems that come with middle age: coping with death, loss of physical beauty and parenting struggles.
However, this ties into the idea that these individually wonderful movies work exponentially better in tandem. While Before Sunrise addresses a gauntlet of ideas and issues that face a college-age viewer, Before Midnight functions almost as a time machine, showing that viewer the sort of issues that will stay the same, those that will no longer seem important and those that will rise to take their place.
Unlike the majority of trilogies, Before Midnight has no explosions or gunfights. Instead, the primary tension is drawn from human emotions and struggles. At no point does it seem as if the two sequels were unnecessary; instead, each built upon the success of the first to make a beautiful series.
The ending to Midnight is characteristically lovely, framing the story and not giving many answers to the many questions Jesse and Celine face. One can only hope that in nine years a fourth installment will arrive, ruining Midnight’s ending to open the next window into Jesse and Celine’s lives.

With a 15-match winning streak against the Cardinal and after bouncing the team from the NCAA quarterfinals last season, the No. 5 USC women’s tennis team could not have expected a more favorable matchup in the NCAA round of 16 on Friday, May 17.
But the Women of Troy ran into a Cardinal buzzsaw, as No. 12 Stanford topped USC 4-3 in a tightly contested match. The Cardinal has continued to defy the odds in the NCAA tournament, progressing all the way to the championship round against No. 3 Texas A&M, which will take place today.
“It’s very disappointing, but we certainly give them credit,” head coach Richard Gallien said. “They played really well. I thought if we got past the match, we were probably the favorites. It came down to the end, so this one will definitely sting for a while.”
The doubles play was a back-and-forth affair. Stanford’s doubles pair of Natalie Dillon and Krista Hardebeck drew first blood in the match, trouncing USC’s pair of Gabriella DeSimone and Danielle Lao 8-1. USC promptly responded, as sophomores Giuliana Olmos and Zoë Scandalis notched an 8-6 victory over Stanford’s No. 28 pair of Stacey Tan and Ellen Tsay.
The results on courts two and three set up a rubber match on the first court between USC’s heralded and undefeated duo of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria — ranked No. 2 in the country — and Stanford’s No. 8 pair of Kristie Ahn and Nicole Gibbs. After rocketing to a 4-1 advantage, Christian and Santamaria stumbled, losing six consecutive games. Though the resilient pair battled back, they lost the tiebreaker, allowing Stanford to notch the first point of the day.
“Not winning the doubles, which we’ve tended to do most of the year, was a tough one,” Gallien said. “They basically battled a little better than we did.”
In the singles portion of the match, Stanford and USC traded several blows as six matches raged simultaneously. Stanford jumped to a 2-0 lead when No. 103 Tan defeated Olmos in two sets 6-2, 6-2. But the Women of Troy won three of the next four singles matches, with Scandalis, Lao and Christian all emerging victorious. No. 2 Santamaria lost to No. 13 Gibbs on court one in straight sets 7-6, 6-2, snapping her 21-match win streak.
The final singles match, which ultimately determined the winner, pitted No. 79 DeSimone against No. 92 Tsay, with DeSimone losing in a three-set heartbreaker, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.
In trying to pinpoint what allowed the Cardinal to shake off its USC funk, Gallien could not offer an explanation other than Stanford playing exceptionally well. Gallien differentiated tennis from football — a game in which there are clear turning points and mistakes that cost games.
“In a football game, there’s only one ball and there’s only one field, so the momentum in a football game can go back and forth, whereas in a tennis match, you have six matches going on at the same time and there are all sorts of things going on,” Gallien said.
With a quick turnaround Wednesday, as the Women of Troy begin the NCAA Individuals, USC doesn’t have much time to dwell on its surprising loss. The doubles pairing of Christian and Santamaria will look to rebound as the No. 2 seed in the tournament, and Lao and Scandalis will join Santamaria in the singles portion in search of a national title.
“They’re going to respond really well,” Gallien said. “We’ve got the best doubles team in the country and we have three excellent singles players. We’re going to be ready.”
It is time for a change in the head coach. Gallien has had more than enough years to prove himself worthy
of this position. Another of his high ranked teams that goes nowhere in the only tournament that counts.

An outstanding four-year championship run ended for the USC men’s tennis program on Saturday, May 18, in Urbana, Ill., as the No. 4 Trojans were knocked from their throne by the No. 5 Ohio State Buckeyes 4-3 in the  quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.

The quarterfinal match set up a rematch of the 2009 NCAA title match, which USC won to claim their first of four consecutive NCAA championships. The Trojans also squared off against and defeated the Buckeyes in the 2010 quarterfinals.
But USC faced a much stronger Ohio State squad bent on revenge Saturday, as the Buckeyes first fended off the match point in the deciding doubles match and won the tiebreaker to take an early lead.
The Trojans came back from losing the doubles point, but the Buckeyes stayed in control, winning the three singles matches necessary to ultimately overcome the Trojans.
“Congratulations to [Ohio State head coach] Ty Tucker and his team,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “They played a great match and deserved this win.”
This was the third time in the last five NCAA tournaments that USC has faced Ohio State. After upsetting the Buckeyes in the  championship, 4-1, in 2009, the Trojans did the same in the 2010 quarterfinals.
The 4-3 loss gave the Trojans a 26-5 end to their 2013 season.
Two of three doubles matches stretched into exciting tiebreakers. USC’s pair of junior Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann fell 8-3 on court one to the Buckeyes’ pair of Peter Kobelt and Connor Smith. But the match on court three was much closer, as USC’s pair of sophomore Eric Johnson and freshman Max de Vroome came down the wire against Ohio State’s Hunter Callahan and Blaz Rola. The two teams were even at 8-8 before heading to a tiebreaker, where the Trojans quickly took control, jumping to a 4-0 lead that gave them the momentum to take the 9-8 victory .
Meanwhile, USC’s undefeated pair of junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Roberto Quiroz dueled with the Buckeyes’ McCarthy/Van Engelen. The Buckeyes served the match with an 8-7 lead, but the Trojan duo forced a tiebreak. This was a very tight tiebreak: Both teams were even at 7-7, until Ohio State scored two straight points to hold on for the win with a 9-7 decision. The Trojans’ second loss gave the Buckeyes their first point of the afternoon.
In singles, USC got on the board with Johnson putting away the Buckeyes’ Chris Diaz early in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, on court five to equalize the match 1-1. However, on court one, Gomez could not handle the sharpshooting of Ohio State’s Blaz Rola, whose 6-1, 6-0 decison made the match 2-1 Ohio State.
Once again, USC responded as de Vroome brought home a 6-3, 6-1 win in straight sets over Ohio State’s Constantin Christ.
At the No. 4 spot, the Trojans’ Quiroz fell in a first-set tiebreaker and never recovered, falling 7-6, 6-1 to McCarthy. On court three, Hanfmann reigned in the equalizer with a 7-5, 7-6 win over Connor Smith.
Tied at three victories each, the teams faced one another in a final singles match on court two.
There, the Trojans’ Sarmiento took on Ohio State’s Peter Kobelt. Both held serve throughout the match, and both sets were decided via tiebreaker. In the end, Sarmiento was outmatched by the power and heavy hitting of Kobelt, who went on to win both tiebreaks, clinching the win for the Buckeyes with a 7-6, 7-6 win.
The 4-3 loss was USC’s first loss in the NCAA tournament since 2008.
USC doesn’t have the luxury of mourning the loss of its title streak, however, as the NCAA Individuals begin today.

When USC and UCLA took the field this weekend for their annual three-game clash, it was hard to envision two more different teams and programs. Here were the Bruins (37-15, 20-7), ranked No. 8 in the country on pace to win 40 games for the fourth time in five years with seven postseason appearances in the past nine, including trips to the College World Series in two of the last three years.
Welcomed addition · After transferring from UPenn, senior outfielder Greg Zebrack has helped pace an otherwise young USC offense. He currently ranks second on the team with a .337 batting average across 51 games. – Natalie Qasabian | Daily Trojan
Then there were the Trojans (19-33, 11-17), with just one winning season in the last decade, on pace for the least number of wins by a USC baseball team since the 1985 squad went 22-44.
And so the Bruins’ three-game sweep of the Trojans hardly came as a surprise. UCLA will in all likelihood host a regional and has a legitimate shot at a top-8 seed and the chance to host a super regional, while the Trojans have nothing to play for. Or so it would seem.
The lessons drawn from this series seem endless. Looking at the stat sheet alone, UCLA doesn’t seem like a team that should be one of the favorites to reach Omaha. The Bruins hit just over .250 as a team, which is second-to-last in the Pac-12. Their 256 runs scored put them sixth in the conference. Their pitching is better, but not special. Of their four starters, only one has an ERA below 2.50.
“We really don’t think they’re that much better than us,” USC senior outfielder Greg Zebrack said. “We easily could have won those games and if it wasn’t for [UCLA shortstop Pat] Valaika playing his brains out, we might have won all three.”
Valaika and Bruin third baseman Kevin Kramer were amazing defensively all weekend. On Friday, Valaika made a leaping catch to snag a would-be game-tying base hit away from Zebrack with two outs in the seventh. The Bruins won that game 2-1.
On Saturday, Valaika made three fantastic plays to end the seventh, eighth and ninth innings, saving at least a pair of runs in the process. UCLA won that game 7-6.
“I don’t think their pitching beat us. I don’t think their hitting beat us. I think the left side of their infield beat us,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs. “Kramer and Valaika won the series. I thought we hit the ball harder than they did and strung together really good at-bats. But when you play really good teams, it comes down to such little things. A play, a pitch, a hit. And they were just a little better, so tip your hat.”
To put it in baseball terms, the Bruins simply made the plays, which is something the youthful Trojans and their 16 true freshmen have struggled with this year. On Sunday, which was Senior Day at Dedeaux Field, the Trojans started five freshman, including on the mound.
While the youth of the team has been tough to watch at times this year, there is no denying there is talent, even among the sometimes-ugly growing pains.
“I knew we were gonna go through some trials and tribulations because of our youth and inexperience,” Hubbs said. “But I am excited. I was excited about it from day one.”
Hubbs then proceeded to list every player he was excited about for next season, based on the strides they made in this one. He mentioned 16 names, and every one of them was legitimate.
“At the beginning of the season it was tough,” said senior second baseman Adam Landecker. “But as the season got on a bunch of freshman got quality experience, and they can really help the team next year. So it should be fun to watch.”
But there are still three games left this year as the Trojans wrap up their season with defending national champion Arizona this weekend in Tucson, Ariz. Like the Bruins this year, the Wildcats weren’t the most eye-popping bunch of players when they won in Omaha a year ago. But they found a way to win, something the Trojans can learn from.
“It’s really contagious,” Zebrack said of a winning culture. “Once you know how to do that, you just get it done. You just make the plays. And it makes everyone grow up a little bit faster.”
Growing up fast is exactly what the Trojans need to do.

Defeating all rivals, finishing the season with an undefeated record, setting new offensive records. These are all respectable goals for any athletic team, but for the USC women’s water polo team, none of them mattered if it didn’t achieve the highest goal of all: winning the NCAA championship.

On Sunday, May 12, the squad did just that, reaching the apex of collegiate water polo with a thrilling 10-9 sudden-death victory over Stanford in the NCAA title game. After finishing regulation in a dead heat with the Cardinal, the Women of Troy engaged in a standoff for two more overtime periods and two additional sudden death periods before freshman driver Anni Espar sealed the victory with a laser that ricocheted off the crossbar and into the goal.
USC, seeded first in the tournament, brought a 27-1 record into the game. Stanford handed the team its only loss of the season in USC’s final home game on April 13, a 6-4 affair where the Cardinal dominated on the defensive end. The Women of Troy, however, still led the season series against their top rivals heading into the final game with victories over Stanford in late February and again in the Mountain Pacfic Sports Federation conference championship on April 28.
Previous records and statistics were meaningless for this game, though, as the slate was wiped clean before action commenced in Boston this month. The Women of Troy arrived in the championship game by defeating eighth-seeded Pomona-Pitzer in the first round 27-1 and then blasting fourth-seeded Hawai’i 16-9 in the semifinals. Stanford had a considerably tougher road to the title game, having to top seventh-seeded Iona in the first round and then defeat a very tough UCLA squad in the semifinals.
Stanford appeared to have the upper hand early in the game, bursting to a 2-0 lead after the first period of play and tacking on another unanswered goal in the second quarter. The Women of Troy, however, did not back down, as junior two-meter Madeline Rosenthal scored two goals and senior two-meter Nicolina McCall added one in the second frame to cut into the deficit.
The second half went back and forth, but USC gained the edge late in the fourth quarter as Espar scored a go-ahead goal with less than a minute left in regulation. With 35 seconds to play, the Cardinal had a 6-on-5 power-play opportunity, but USC junior goalie Flora Bolonyai made a huge save to hold on to the lead just a little longer. The lead wouldn’t last for long, though, as Stanford sophomore two-meter Ashley Grossman tipped in a pass with 12 seconds to go to knot the game at seven apiece.
Overtime began. The Women of Troy scored early in the first period of overtime when junior driver Kelly Mendoza found the back of the net to put USC up by one goal. The Cardinal, with a continual flair for the dramatic, nailed an equalizing goal with 10 seconds to go in the period as freshman driver Maggie Steffens squeaked a goal past Bolonyai.
Stanford scored first in the second regular overtime period on a goal by senior two-meter Melissa Seidemann, but with 55 seconds left, USC junior two-meter Hannah Buckling tied the game with her fourth goal. Bolonyai came up with a huge save before the period ended, and with the score standing at 9-9, the squads headed into the first period of sudden death.
Neither team could find the net in the first two periods of sudden death overtime as both defenses went into lockdown mode. In the third period of sudden death Stanford had several golden opportunities to score, but Bolonyai came through in the clutch, blocking both scoring opportunities. The second block set up the Women of Troy for their grand finale.
With 1:13 on the clock, Espar made her way to the center of the pool, drew a foul and rocketed in what would prove to be the winning goal. The Trojan bench erupted as soon as the ball found its way across the goal line — because with Espar’s goal, all of the hard work for the season had paid off in the form of an NCAA title.
“We’ve worked so hard, we’ve done so much training, so much swimming, so much everything to finally be [in the championship game],” Rosenthal said after the game. “We all knew, especially when it went into overtime, that we’ve come too far [not to win] … We fought and we fought and we fought and we ended up with the trophy.”
The championship is the USC women’s water polo program’s fourth overall. In each of the previous three seasons (1999, 2004 and 2010), the program won the championship in the same school year as the men’s team, and this season was no different: The men’s squad locked up their fifth straight championship in 2012.
“We knew it was going to be a war, we knew it was going to take every ounce of energy we had,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “I give so much credit to our players. We were down by three, we looked like we were going to win the game in regulation; they tied it. What a goal by Anni Espar at the end. It was absolutely one of those games for the ages.”
With her outstanding performance in the cage, Bolonyai was crowned MVP of the tournament. Her 17 saves in the title game set a career high for the junior. Not only did Bolonyai serve as an anchor in the pool, her confidence outside of it set the tone for the team as well.
“I was thinking that we were up 5-0 at MPSF [against the Cardinal], we are able to play good water polo against Stanford, and we can do it,” Bolonyai said. “At least for me it was important that we have beaten them before.”
This victory brings the USC seniors’ careers full circle. They won the NCAA championship as freshmen in 2010, and after falling in the NCAA tournament twice as sophomores and juniors, returned to glory in their fourth year.

On May 16, President Barack Obama told the public about evidence that shows chemical weapons being used in the ongoing Syrian crisis, according to BBC News.
Though the existence of chemical weapons being currently used is troublesome for many, the United States must not use this as a catalyst for intervening in the conflict.
The United Nations General Assembly recently voted on a resolution that condemned the Assad regime. World powers are coming together to decide whether or not the presence of foreign aid, either directly through military intervention, or indirectly through food, water, first aid and medicine should be a priority. The results showed 107 votes in favor, compared to the 133 in favor from the assembly in August.
But while discussing the issue at hand is imperative and the acts of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad absolutely abhorrent, nations at large must first evaluate the situation before rushing into armed conflicts without comprehending the repercussions and utilizing information that might not be valid.
Conflicting reports from a battle on March 19 allege that Assad’s army delivered chemical weapons using a Scud missile. The State Department recently discovered that there is “evidence that chemical weapons were used in Syria’s brutal civil war, but it is unclear who used them.”
Finding chemical weapons in the country would be strategic to building an international coalition to put boots on the ground. Looking to the historical example of Iraq as a guide, Obama has decided to wait for such reports to be fully substantiated before committing American soldiers to the conflict.
It appears that such a decision delays the fulfillment of short-term goals in the country and the region. However, even if chemical weapons were actually used, the specter of rebel factionalism would still remain; foreign aid would not coalesce the rebel splinters.
A full-on invasion might be the most preferable option once the matter is fully investigated. For the time being, the facts of the matter show that our armed forces not be ruled by the dictate of their passions.

As summertime rolls around and the sun and ocean begin to beckon eager pupils, one last roadblock stands in the way of true vacation bliss: the impending release of final grades.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
And though grades are important for scholarships, athletic requirements and passing one’s classes, a great GPA is only one of many factors that potential employers look at.
“Employers understand that students have different circumstances,” Laura Morsch of CareerBuilder.com wrote on the site’s blog. “Employers do take a university’s reputation into consideration, but they also understand [that] working to pay your way through school, extracurricular involvement and extenuating circumstances can lower [your] academic marks.”
In the modern workplace, employers tend to look past grades to see a better picture of the student as a whole, USC Career Advisor Carl Martellino told the Daily Trojan.
According to Martellino, employers look at a student’s “involvement in internships, their volunteer work, their teamwork, analytical and communication skills -— both written and verbal — as well as their leadership in teams and clubs.”
It appears as if the professional world works incredibly similar to the way universities consider prospective students for admission. An institution will look at the individual as holistically as possible — an individual who has a balanced resume of both a decent GPA as well as a list of extracurricular activities will present a more favorable option than an achievement in only one area, especially when this includes internships.
“Internships are absolutely critical,” Martellino said. “They give you more options and show employers that you have experience in [a selected] field.”
Martellino also said students focus less on their majors and turn their attention toward gaining experience and skills that will help them in their chosen career path.
Although this means it might be safe for an aspiring actuary to major in accounting, for majors that fall into more “non-vocational” studies, Martellino advises students to “major in what they love and enjoy, and apply or configure the skills they gain from their majors, additional classes, internships and training to their chosen field.”
A company looks for students who have the experiences required to undertake the job and the personality to fit into the workplace.
“In an interview situation, students should tell the story on their resume,” Martellino said. “It’s like a puzzle. Tell the employer why you majored in what you majored in, why you volunteered or interned at these specific places, [and even] what circumstances may have come up that affected your grades [both positively or negatively].” Martellino also stresses the importance of relevant information and experience in one’s resume.
This emphasis on experience and skills is good news for students who might have slacked off during the past year or semester.
“It’s all about balancing your resume,” Martellino said. “If there is a deficiency in GPA, balance it with internships and extra classes. Go back and retake a course or take summer classes to make up for a bad grade. If you have a high GPA but no internships, do an internship after you graduate and work your way up. Someone who did internships while in school will move up faster, but someone with a college degree will still move up much faster than someone without one.”
Unfortunately, the importance of grades does rely on the type of employment or graduate studies program a student is considering. However, even in more vocational paths, students shouldn’t worry themselves over grades. Martellino said that there are always opportunities to balance out a lower grade by doing well on the GRE or gaining experience in an internship, even if it’s unpaid or after the student graduates.
It’s important to realize that very few potential employers will consider a failed class during freshman year too much or look twice at a bad grade in a GE class that gave the student no skill training for the position.
Of course, a high GPA coupled with internship experience, and involvement in organizations and volunteer work is an ideal that all USC students should strive for, students should also give themselves a little bit of breathing room when it comes to grades and not stress too much over a poor mark.
USC offers plenty of opportunities for improvement or advisement on campus to those who wish to improve their professional prospects. Visiting the Career Center, making an appointment at the Writing Center or talking with TAs and professors are good places to start. Additionally, ConnectSC at http://careers.usc.edu/ offers career advice and employment opportunities.
And when final grades are released, students should remember that a bad grade does not mean a bad academic record, nor does it equate to a lost cause in the career world.
And most importantly, it is not an indication of a student’s intelligence, character or capabilities.
