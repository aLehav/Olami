The rich just keep getting richer.
Despite limited scholarships and a subpar season by USC football standards, the Trojans continue to bring in a plethora of talent.
Along with defensive back Isiah Wiley (Yuma, Ariz.), who already committed to the Trojans earlier this week, offensive lineman David Garness (San Francisco, Calif.), signed his letter of intent to be a Trojan as well.
Garness was a two-time (2009-2010) All-NorCal Conference first team selection as an offensive tackle at City of College of San Francisco.
Both Wiley and Garness will be entering USC as juniors.
The Trojans will also be bringing in quarterback Cody Kessler (Bakersfield, Calif.), who was the 2010 Gatorade California Player of the Year at Centennial High School. He threw for 2831 yards and 36 TDs, and ran for eight TDs as a senior. As a junior, he was named Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass and Bakersfield Californian Area Player of the Year.
Another quarterback in Max Wittek (Santa Ana, Calif.) of Mater Dei HS also committed to the Trojans. Wittek, a Connecticut native, was named to the All-Trinity League first team for the Mater Dei Monarchs. He threw for 2,252 yards and 24 TDs, and also ran for six TDs during his senior year.
Fullback Soma Vainuku (Eureka, Calif.) who happens to be former Trojans’ linebacker Rey Maualuga’s cousin, and placekicker Andre Heidari (Bakersfield, Calif.) round out the spring enrollees on the first day of the mid-year signing period.
Vainuku originally signed with USC in February 2010, but did not qualify for admission.  During the 2009 season, he earned Super Prep All-Farwest, Cal-Hi All-State Medium Schools first team and All-Humboldt-Del Norte Big Four League first team as a linebacker and fullback.
Head coach Lane Kiffin still expects more spring enrollees to sign with USC in the near future.

Trojans and Bruins were in perfect harmony Wednesday night.
Several Trojan singers have been competing on NBC’s The Sing-Off with their a cappella group the Backbeats, a collection of college-aged vocalists from USC, UCLA and BYU – and on Wednesday, the Backbeats advanced to the show’s  final round.
The Backbeats performed a Lady Gaga medley Wednesday night, giving several of the group’s best singers a chance to shine while incorporating creative – but not over-the-top – choreography. The performance was well-received by the judges.
“You guys work together really well and you’ve got so much depth on the bench,” Ben Folds told the group.
In the second hour of the show, after surviving elimination, the Backbeats sang “Landslide,” with Joanna Jones, a musical theater major from UCLA, taking the lead. Jones’ subdued but powerful performance, with strong backing vocals from the rest of the group, brought members of the audience to their feet, and brought tears to group member Courtney Jensen’s eyes.
Judge Shawn Stockman, of Boyz II Men, said after the performance, “I could’ve closed my eyes and been somewhere else, it was that beautiful.”
The Backbeats’ fate now lies in America’s hands. Voting is open to anyone, and on Monday, Dec. 20, the winner of the competition will be revealed. The winning group receives $100,000 and a Sony Epic Music Contract.
The group, which was begun by two Trojan singers,  includes former members of the SoCal VoCals and the Trojan Men, two USC a cappella groups.
The Trojan members of the Backbeats are graduates Catherine Ricafort ’09 , Todd G. Levin ’09, Kenton Chen ’10 and Eitan Nir ’10; seniors Kelly Jakle and Rachel Saltzman,  both communication majors; and junior Thomas Henry, majoring in business administration.

Lane Kiffin and USC will not only be forced to contend with limited scholarship players stemming from NCAA sanctions next season, but also the departures of current underclassmen to the professional ranks.
Defensive tackle Jurrell Casey and offensive tackle Tyron Smith, both first-team All-Pac-10 selections, will each forgo their final season of eligibility and declare for April’s NFL Draft, according to reports appearing in multiple media outlets.
“We wish Jurrell and Tyron the best as they move on to a professional career and we thank them for their great contributions to the Trojan football program,” said Kiffin in a statement. “We realize there are many factors that go into a player’s decision to leave early or stay in school, and we’ll always support the decision that he and his family make.”
The decisions, however, do not come as a major surprise.
Casey was projected as an NFL prospect before the season began, and presently, ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. ranks the former Long Beach Poly High standout as the No. 4 defensive tackle among underclassmen. In 2010, Casey recorded 67 tackles, including 41/2 sacks, and was announced Sunday as the Trojans’ most valuable player at the team’s annual awards banquet held at Galen Center.
“I think I’m ready to go to the next level and play against the best,” Casey told Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times Tuesday.
Smith, who is also projected to be selected early in April’s draft, is currently ranked as the No. 5 overall underclassmen offensive tackle prospect according to Kiper.
“Seeing great players leave early for the NFL is something we’re very accustomed to at USC and it’s something that will continue to happen in the future,” Kiffin added. “We’ll continue to bring in great players like Jurrell and Tyron who will have opportunities to leave early for the NFL.”
