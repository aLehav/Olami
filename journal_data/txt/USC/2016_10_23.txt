Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanHome woes · Junior outside hitter Niki Withers spikes the ball in a loss on Sunday. The Women of Troy are just 7-7 this season at the Galen Center.
No. 25 women’s volleyball split its matches over the weekend. The Women of Troy (14-7, 6-4 Pac-12) swept Cal (8-12, 2-8 Pac-12) on Friday (25-22, 25-21, 25-18), but then they were swept by No. 14 Stanford (12-6, 6-4 Pac-12) on Sunday (22-25, 19-25, 21-25).
Head coach Mick Haley gives credit to Stanford for getting the win on Sunday, but he wanted to see more from his team.
“I felt like we should have won,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We had some real nice stretches of play, but I felt like maybe we’ve got to be more determined.”
Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier led the team with 22 kills on the weekend. Sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford put up 19 kills and junior opposite Brittany Abercrombie recorded 16 kills.
Senior libero Taylor Whittingham put up 21 digs on the weekend, and she has 17 double-digit dig matches this season. Against Cal, Whittingham moved into fourth with 1,538 digs, ahead of Nancy Hillman (1985-88, 1,536 digs), on USC’s all-time dig leaders list.
Along with being the foundation to USC’s defense, Whittingham is a leader on the court.
“More of an opportunity to show and be a senior leader out there and calm down the freshmen,” Whittingham said.
Against Stanford, the Women of Troy played tough, but the Cardinal threw a block party at the net, out-blocking USC 14-6.
“They make points with their blocking,” Haley said. “They can’t manufacture points many other ways.”
Stanford’s lead blockers, Inky Ajanaku, Merete Lutz and Audriana Fitzmorris, stand at 6-foot-3, 6-foot-8 and 6-foot-6, respectively, and they combined for 6.5 blocks in the game. In contrast, USC’s lead blockers senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins and Lanier stand at 6-foot-3 and 6-foot-2, respectively.
“It’s difficult for our hitters to get used to that,” Whittingham said. “But now we know what to expect for the next time we play them.”
Despite the height differential, Haley noted that he was OK with the team’s blocking performance. He was more focused on the team upping the velocity on their serves to limit Stanford’s height advantage at the net.
“We needed to help ourselves with the serve to keep them off the net so they couldn’t attack us with their height,” Haley said.
USC has completed first half of conference play. At 6-4, they’re tied for third in the conference, but it’s really anybody’s chance to win it all.
“We have to win the rest of our games,” Whittingham said. “That’s basically all it comes down to.”
With 10 matches left to play in the Pac-12, Haley has his focus set on winning through November.
“We have to win in November,” Haley said. “Even if we’re ugly, we want to win any way we can win.”
Against Stanford, USC went on some scoring runs when the team was running on all cylinders. It’s those glimpses that the Women of Troy play to their full potential.
“I’m really trying to impart our team to absolutely kick it up in the internal fight,” Haley said. “Sometimes they don’t know how good they are, and I’m just trying to tell them.”
For the Women of Troy to win their final matches of the season, the intensity and fight level will be key. He knows it’s hard to ask from the team considering it’s hard for them to play competitive six-on-six during practices between injuries and resting players to keep them at full playing level for their matches.
“I don’t like it that they seem to not just give every ounce of energy,” Haley said. “They have to try to defeat the opponent. Once we get to that point, then we have a chance to get really good.”
USC will be back at home this weekend facing Utah and Colorado to start off the second half of Pac-12 play.

With the emergence of Colorado and Washington State as legitimate Pac-12 contenders, it is clear as ever how important coaching is in college football. The strength of a conference can be directly tied to the prowess of its head coaches, and right now the Pac-12 is undergoing a power shift.
All it took for the Big Ten to return to national prominence was an infusion of coaching talent. Add Jim Harbaugh, Urban Meyer, Paul Chryst, Mike Riley and James Franklin in the last few years and the conference is significantly better than it was just five years ago. Overnight, the conference has been rebranded from an also-ran to this year’s strongest contender to the SEC in terms of national dominance.
Hopefully, the same will be true for the Pac-12 as well. The trajectory of a program is determined by the man at the helm. A bad hire can have rapidly drastic consequences, as is the case of Oregon. Mark Helfrich appears to follow the same pattern as Larry Coker at Miami and Frank Solich at Nebraska — great assistants without the skillset to keep a program dominant. In just two years the team has gone from a national-title favorite to battling for a .500 season.
In contrast, Chris Petersen at Washington took an underperforming and somewhat poorly coached, yet loaded Washington roster and turned it into a juggernaut within three years. Mike MacIntyre has turned in an arguably more impressive performance at Colorado, building up a dormant program into a respectable foe in only four seasons.
The upper echelon of decision-makers in the conference would be sorely lacking if Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham wasn’t mentioned. No coach consistently develops prospects into talented team players, while dominating the junior college recruiting pipeline. The fact that graduate transfer defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu was a rotational player at best at Utah and is now an integral part of the USC defensive line speaks to the excellence in coaching and developing Whittingham and his staff possess.
The coaching talent continues down the Pac-12 conference, with standouts at both Arizona schools and unique offensive minds at the northern California universities. While Gary Andersen has struggled thus far at Oregon State, his track record is impressive and he looks to be in the nascent stages of a building a program that brings back memories of Riley’s best years as the coach of the Beavers.
All of this coaching talent bodes well for the conference as a whole. After losing tremendous coaches to other jobs in Riley at Oregon State, Harbaugh at Stanford and Kelly at Oregon, the Pac-12 teams have done a good job of reloading and creating a more competitive atmosphere.
For USC, the problem with is the playing field has been leveled. It appears that Oregon and Stanford’s days as the pride of the conference are over, and one would have hoped that USC would have been better prepared to reassume that mantle. There is still some hope, as USC probably has the most talented and dynamic quarterback in the Pac-12, which it hasn’t had in quite a while.
However, over the grand scheme, coaching will determine if USC rises to the top or stays a notch below. The location and brand of Trojan football will always bring in top flight recruits, but only coaching and development will dictate whether or not USC is a playoff contender or on the fringe of competing for a Pac-12 South title.
The jury is still out on Clay Helton’s coaching prowess. Ignoring his in-game coaching decisions, which have improved of late, his most important attribute might be what he can do from March to September in terms of coaching his players up. The team is more disciplined and more fundamentally sound than in years past, and if Helton can build on that and harness the immense raw talent he has at his disposal, USC could be elevated as a program — and he could as a coach as well.
UCLA football is dealing with its own coaching issues. Their season may be a case study in what happens when a questionable offensive coordinator gets the keys to a Ferrari. It crashes and burns when the driver attempts to turn it in an off-road vehicle.  The Bruins this season are a testament to how important coordinators are as well.
Hopefully, USC takes notice to the team across town and continues to coach and scheme to its players’ strengths instead of whatever is going on at UCLA. The Trojans no longer control their own destiny this season, but they have a chance to determine the fate of the program for years to come. Coaching will be the lead navigator. The hope is they follow the roadmap laid out by Washington, Utah and Colorado.
Those programs are quality brands with excellent captains. USC, with the right person behind the wheel, has the chance to be a Bugatti, leaving everyone behind in the dust.

Locked in a three-way tie atop the Pac-12 standings with Stanford and Colorado, No. 5 USC women’s soccer hosted Washington at McAlister Field on Sunday in search of another vital victory and came out with a 1-0 shutout win over the Huskies.
The Women of Troy began Sunday level with the Cardinal and Buffaloes at 18 points apiece (all teams were 6-1-0), and they pulled ahead with three points on Sunday. Redshirt junior forward Alex Anthony’s strike made the difference for USC in the team’s home finale.
Washington was sitting in the conference cellar and had lost eight of its last nine coming into Sunday’s game, and the Women of Troy tried to twist the knife with an aggressive start. Despite a great deal of pressure, however, USC was caught offside several times in the opening minutes, scuttling its offensive momentum.
“[Washington] played much higher than many of the other teams we’ve played so far,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said, crediting the Huskies’ offside trap. “But the quality and timing of our final pass wasn’t good. We had opportunities … that we just missed.”
The Women of Troy appeared to be the more threatening side early in the first half, stringing together passes and spending significant minutes inside the attacking third, but it was Washington that came up with the first shot on target. A long-range effort forced a smart save out of redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme in the 17th minute, and the Huskies were ruled offside when the ball wound up in the net on the subsequent corner kick.
The game opened up from that point, with an emboldened Washington team challenging the heavy favorites. USC continued to move the ball effectively up the pitch, but no one was able to execute the key pass to fashion a clear-cut scoring opportunity. Prudhomme’s save was one of  two she made in the entire first half, and the Women of Troy had yet to test Kaylyn Smith in the Huskies’ goal when the first 45 minutes ended 0-0.
Anthony admitted the team was pressing a little too hard, which made passing a little wayward.
“It was on us — our concentration and our focus from trying to get that final pass in,” she said.
As the team has done so often this season, however, USC came flying out of the gates to start the second half and seized a 1-0 lead. Sophomore Leah Pruitt cut inside on the right flank, hugging the end line, and played in a short pass to Anthony, who was set up at the goalmouth. The redshirt junior rolled her defender at point-blank range and calmly fired home to break the deadlock in the 49th minute.
Though Anthony said she was disappointed that the team was only able to beat the goalkeeper once, McAlpine was happy with his squad’s offensive effort.
“That’s a quality forward talking,” he said of Anthony’s comments. “No — I think they made it tough. They made the spaces to play in very difficult, so it was really important to find seams.”
USC looked like it was finally settling in after pushing in front, but the Huskies found some momentum in the closing stages. Washington laid siege to the Trojan net for the final 10 minutes of the game, pumping multiple free kicks into the box, but Prudhomme and company held firm to seal a nerve-wracking win when time ran out on the comeback.
“We haven’t had a game like that in a while, where we needed to kill it at the end,” Anthony said. “So it was a good reminder of how to slow down and finish out the game when we only have a 1-0 lead. It was a good test for us, and I thought we handled it well.”
Heading into the final three games of the regular season, USC will have few complaints about a victory, and McAlpine was confident in the team’s play as the postseason looms.
“The title race is tough at the top: The top six are very tight,” he said. “Today was very, very important, and I feel good about the direction we’re going in.”
The Women of Troy hit the road next, traveling to Salt Lake City to take on Utah this Thursday before facing Colorado in Boulder over the weekend. USC then wraps up its regular season with a tilt against archrivals UCLA at the StubHub Center on Nov. 4.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanBack on the hardwood · Head coach Andy Enfield will begin his fourth season at the helm of the men’s basketball program. He is coming off his best season yet in 2015-2016, when the Trojans won 21 games.
Coming off its first appearance in the NCAA tournament in five years, the men’s basketball team will enter the 2016-2017 season just outside the top 25 rankings in the USA Today Coaches Poll and — in a separate poll — is predicted to finish seventh in the Pac-12 by the media.
Both lists were released late last week. USC received 14 votes in the coaches poll, placing it in the top 40. Three Pac-12 teams placed in the top 25 — Oregon came in fifth, Arizona 11th and UCLA 20th. Cal received 43 votes, third most among teams not in the top 25.
In the Pac-12 media poll, USC finished behind Washington and ahead of Utah, with Oregon claiming the top spot for the first time.
Last season, the Trojans were predicted to finish 10th in the Pac-12. They wound up sixth with a 21-13 overall record and a 9-9 clip in conference play, surpassing expectations.
This year, USC will be tasked with replacing the production of Julian Jacobs and Nikola Jovanovic, significant contributors last season who both declared for the NBA draft. The Trojans also lost Katin Reinhardt, Darion Clark, Malik Marquetti and Malik Martin and will have to rely on recruits and transfers to step up in 2016-2017.
Losing all those still eligible players means something going on behind the scene. The pollsters don’t recognize the
influx of new people being that big of contributors with their ratings. Half or more of the starters are gone from last
year.

USC will participate in Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot project in an effort to create a new database to advance cancer research, according to a press release sent out last week.
The research will be conducted by the Kuhn Laboratory at USC, part of the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. The goal of the initiative is to accelerate the development and approval of simple, accurate and reliable blood tests for biologically based precision treatment and disease monitoring.
Peter Kuhn, associate director of the Kuhn Laboratory, said what makes the Cancer Moonshot initiative significant is that it puts the patient at the center.
Photo from Marc Nozell, FlickrCombating cancer · Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here at a campaign event in 2012, announced Monday that his Cancer Moonshot initiative would partner with USC to develop a new blood profiling system.
“The original moonshot was really about putting man on the moon and returning man safely to earth, so it’s about that safe journey,” Kuhn said.
USC will be in charge of contributing data from the High-Definition Single-Cell Assay, an analysis framework that characterizes cancer from a simple blood draw.
“People’s cancer can be manifested in their blood, DNA fragments shed from the cancer or cells that are shed from the cancer,” said James Hicks, a professor of research at the Bridge Institute. “By sequencing DNA or analyze the protein expressions and the shape and size of the cells and blood, we’ve already shown that we can tell when cancer is actually changing in a time course.”
The data will be compiled to make the Blood Profiling Atlas Pilot, a database designed to help accelerate cancer therapeutic research and development. The Blood Profiling Atlas aims to improve a doctor’s ability to track cancer progression and disease treatment decisions.
“The Blood Profiling Atlas, which is the most recent announcement from Monday, is where we actually step back and say ‘we have one way of characterizing blood, but there is another half dozen or so ways of characterizing blood,’” Kuhn said. “‘What if we all get together and build a large database where eventually we will take blood samples from the patients and characterize them in a bunch of different ways and put the data back together?’”
Kuhn and the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience have used the Convergence Science Initiative in Cancer to emphasize the need for research and development of what Kuhn calls the continuum of cancer care.
“That, of course, requires us to understand both cancer as a disease and how it evolves in each individual patient over time, as well as the patient’s health, but also the patient as a person of course,” Kuhn said.
The Bridge Institute has taken the responsibility to find ways to obtain that data.
Photo from USC NewsNew frontiers · Peter Kuhn was named dean’s professor of biological sciences in 2014. Now, he is the associate director of the Bridge Institute.
“We have 20 people looking at how the behavior of the DNA and the cells in the blood of cancer patients, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, and the idea is to be able to identify early warning of any changes in the cancer that are occurring that might lead to resistance of therapy or that might lead to the need to change therapies,” Hicks said.
While last Monday’s announcement primarily dealt with the Blood Profiling Atlas, the Bridge institute has also made other developments that will be utilized by the Cancer Moonshot.
“We have also run this pilot program, clinical trial where we are quantifying the health performance data, and that actually was part of the final report to President Obama that was delivered on Monday,” Kuhn said. “Both of these programs have resonated well with Cancer Moonshot team and with the public, as well as those representing a real need in cancer research as it applies to how it evolves in the patient.”
USC will be undertaking the project with 19 other partners, combining its research with that of 13 different studies to make available raw data sets from circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and clinical data. The project has received support from all corners of the healthcare industry.
“In the meeting on Monday and Tuesday, there were representatives of all the major pharmaceutical companies and all the branches of government that have anything to do with healthcare: the VA, the Department of Defense, the National Cancer Institute and the FDA,” Hicks said. “This effort now has very broad support within the government and within the pharmaceutical industry.”
Praying that all these branches of government will participate in helping to prevent radioactive radon reduction with active preventative policies in place.  Radioactive radon gas exposure-a leading cause of lung cancer- if taken as a separate category of cancer is number 7 on the list of causes of cancer death in our nation.  No one seems to know about radon and our government is sweeping it under the carpet like a dirty secret. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/009e4662c15de637238c375e0c971d117eb157e674e21ca320a390aaf21a172a.jpg

While most political polls have found that the majority of voters support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, the Daybreak Poll, a partnership between the Los Angeles Times and the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, paints a different picture. The poll, which was first published in July, predicts a victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump by 44.4 percent over Clinton’s 44.1 percent. However, the poll has recently come under fire from public figures, other pollsters and national news outlets — most notably The New York Times — for its methods, which critics say have skewed the data in favor of Trump.
The Daybreak Poll data comes from The Understanding America Study, a survey panel of about 3,200 American households recruited for their demographic diversity. The study was designed to encompass the full diversity of the American people and even includes underrepresented socioeconomic groups who might normally be left out of polling surveys. According to Tania Gutsche, managing director of CESR, this gives it an advantage over other polls that may cut out certain segments of society that don’t have the means to respond to polls.
“People who say they don’t have internet or don’t have a computer, we offer them a tablet that has 4G access,” Gutsche said. “It helps bridge the divide between people in the U.S. who have and have not access to computers.”
Furthermore, the selected participants are part of a long-term study rather than a one-time opportunity. Once they agree to participate, they answer weekly surveys online that cover a wide variety of topics, including voting preferences.
However, this sampling method also has disadvantages, according to news outlets that have conducted their own polls and obtained different results. While the study coordinators go to great lengths to choose a representative sample for the entire country, that sample never changes. It consists of the same 3,200 people from beginning to end. This alternative method for conducting polls could explain the heavy skew toward Trump, according to statistical analysis website FiveThirtyEight. Given an initial sample that is predisposed to support Trump from the beginning, all figures down the line would be affected until a new sample is chosen — which would not occur until the election is over.
The Daybreak Poll differs from its counterparts not only in how the participants are selected but also in how the questions are asked. Instead of presenting the question as having a “yes or no” answer, the Daybreak Poll presents the question as a probability, asking participants to rate the likelihood of their voting choice on a scale from zero to 100.
In addition to sample size and question framing, the Daybreak Poll’s post-processing procedure has received criticism. Each day, the responses from the survey are weighted to match demographic characteristics from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey and compared to survey patterns from the 2012 election. This means that the Daybreak Poll’s sample is weighted based on how participants voted in the 2012 presidential election.
While this may seem like a good way to balance out the sample, people rarely accurately report who they voted for in the past, according to The New York Times. For example, if more people in the sample mistakenly recall having voted for Obama in 2012, the results would be skewed toward Trump after the adjustment based on patterns for the 2012 election.
The Daybreak Poll makes information about recruitment procedures, survey weighting and raw data readily available to the general public in an effort to be transparent, Gutsche said. And while its methods have been criticized, she said that she believes the poll to be accurate and fair.
“When we first ran the study in 2012, we were showing much higher scores for Obama than any of the other polls,” Gutsche said. “And at the end of the count, we ended up being the closest of all the polls in terms of what the final vote was, so that gives us confidence that this is the same methodology we’re doing again. It may be right, or that could have just been a fluke.”
I’m sure most liberals and Democrats were all for this method until it started showing Trump gaining on Hillary. They would have been the first to trumpet the fact that it was the most accurate poll in the 2012 election, which was marred by many inaccurate polls  which showed much more support for Romney than there actually was. I have said all along that there is much more support for Trump than anyone is willing to admit and much less support for Hillary than anyone is willing to admit. In 2012 one could SEE, HEAR and FEEL the enthusiasm for Obama, regardless of what the polls were saying. That is not the case today for Hillary. We do not see large enthusiastic crowds at her rallies, we do not hear overwhelming support for the person who is most hated woman in America and we surely do not feel the enthusiasm for her. Quite the contrary. I agree with reving19 that if the NYT disagrees with it, they must be right! Consider also that the LA Times is not known as a great bastion of the Conservative movement! It is a major CALIFORNIA paper, for Pete’s sake.
Were ‘adjustments’ made in the last few days?  Sure seems that way to me.
You are going to be surprised on election day.
How are we going to be surprised?  Such generalities make no sense in either direction. State your case.
Yeah,  until it comes out in favor of Hillary. New York Times criticizing it? Then they must be doing something right.

There is a scene in Moonlight in which a small boy is taught by an older companion to float, and then swim, in the dazzling brim of the Miami shore. Both are black; the boy is Chiron, the youngest version of him the audience will see, and the older man is Juan. Though Juan feeds Chiron, gives him a bed in his home, he is not Chiron’s father — not even close. In fact, he is a dope dealer who profits from the same crack that renders Chiron’s mother desperate and volatile, unable to care for her son.
Photo from A24Chapters of life · Moonlight, which debuted at the Telluride Film Festival, is widely regarded as one of the best movies of 2016.
It is just one of the complexities that makes Moonlight a film so singularly moving — hope, layered with heartbreak, on the characters’ own grapplings with the things that cannot change in their world.  But for now, in the blue waters off the Miami coast, Juan and Chiron are just two heads bobbing beside each other. The music, gliding and electric, swells above them as high as each wave. It is the purest moment of the entire film, and it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful scenes in modern cinema.
Told in three parts, Moonlight follows Chiron as he navigates his way from elementary school to manhood, catapulting him from a young boy (nicknamed “Little” by his peers), to a gangly, bullied teenager, to an unrecognizably muscled man, insulated in his own toughness.
Chiron, over the course of his maturation, is played with subtlety and grace by three different actors (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes, chronologically). And as he grows older, so, too, does his pain graduate from one form to the next. His addicted mother Paula, for example, played ferociously by Naomie Harris, is the anguish in Little’s world. But by the third chapter of the film, the tables have turned. Chiron (now nicknamed “Black”) visits her in rehab, and she reprimands him for the way he makes his living dealing dope on the streets.
Lining the entire film is another source of conflict for Chiron — his own struggles with sexual orientation. Chiron is gay in a world that is unforgiving, and throughout the film the audience witnesses him realize and bury this part of himself.
Another recurring character in each of Moonlight’s chapters is Kevin, Chiron’s friend and fascination, who shapeshifts from friend to lover to bully and then back again. Laced through their story are leaps from public school to the prison system and a roaring sense of toughness that is the only way to survive these stepping stones.
This movie is about masculinity, so it is also a movie about not talking. In this sense, the film is a subversion: No one — except, perhaps, in one moment — says all of what they feel. Instead, we watch Chiron take the pain of his life and build himself around it.
Visually, Moonlight is resoundingly and defiantly beautiful. If once there was a time when movies didn’t know how to light black characters, Moonlight is an exquisite testament to black beauty.
Indeed, director Barry Jenkins uses his camera to paint landscapes: He takes a crack house, an ocean, a parking lot and a high school and makes unforgettable images out of them. Jenkins’ characters don’t just exist on the plane of this world, they move through the world’s colors as if the world was created for them.
And just as color comes to be a theme for Chiron throughout his life —in the nicknames he is given and learns to adapt — so, too, is his world vivid and rich in its hues. This, of course, all points toward the title of the play the film is adapted from: Tarell Alvin McCraney’s “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.” But in the movie’s magical eye, race also becomes another color on Jenkins’ palette. Moonlight makes a masterpiece out of dark skin.
The opening scene of the film employs a roving long take reminiscent of the cinematography for Gravity and Children of Men, both films with stories  that skew more toward a traditional subject: white people, with their lives at stake, in amped-up situations where the world has been thrown off-balance. Rarely do we see films featuring people of color, but even more rarely do we see their stories told with such calculated grace.
As Hilton Als points out in his review of the film for the New Yorker, Moonlight contains no white characters, and essentially no white faces are included in the entire canvas of the film. This is absolutely revolutionary, and also critically important: In an era when Hollywood is finally coming to terms with its centuries-old habit of erasing voices of color, Moonlight stands defiant of anything that preceded it, a role model for young filmmakers that showcases the boundless promise of cinema, the boundless potential in the stories of anyone, anywhere.
Outwardly defiant and in itself an exquisite testament to strength and heartbreak, Moonlight is a story told so tenderly that it holds the audience at the same time it rips them apart.

Lady Gaga is reinventing herself. The critical and commercial failure of her third album, Artpop, was largely due to an unfortunate overshadowing of Gaga’s musical talents by her eccentric persona. Since then, Gaga has attempted to strip away this persona to showcase her raw singing talent, first by collaborating with legend Tony Bennett on the critically lauded jazz offering Cheek to Cheek, and now with her newest album, Joanne. When an artist who is heavily associated with a bombastic image seeks to change, the question becomes whether she can transition without losing the energy that attracted audiences in the first place. Does Gaga do this successfully in Joanne? The results are rather mixed.
Photo from Interscope RecordsThe Mother Monster returns · Lady Gaga released her fifth album, Joanne, on Friday. The album is a bold attempt for the pop star to put aside her eccentric showmanship and expose a more intimate side of herself.
Throughout the album, Gaga explores genres beyond her typical high-energy synthpop and EDM, instead turning to the more mid-tempo styles of soft rock and country. Many tracks are also characterized by funk and Motown, partially thanks to producer Mark Ronson, who has worked with more classically inclined artists such as Adele and Amy Winehouse. Gaga also showcases her vocal skills in several ballads featuring acoustic guitar and piano. Overall, although there are several of her expected up-tempo synthpop tunes, the production of Joanne is more subdued, leaning toward traditional influences and prioritizing Gaga’s voice first.
In Joanne, Gaga does what Nashville acts such as Florida Georgia Line and Luke Bryan have been spectacularly failing to do for years, which is to gracefully harmonize the electronic sound of the 21st century with the conservative country genre. Gaga has dabbled in country before — see her rollicking 2011 hit “You and I” — but she takes it to the next level here with a barrage of arresting songs influenced by the genre; Gaga fuses electronic sounds into the cowboy-themed banger “John Wayne,” breaks out the twangy guitar for the delightfully catchy “A-Yo” and even emulates Spaghetti Western composer Ennio Morricone in “Sinner’s Prayer.”
Besides dipping into country, Gaga also exposes listeners to her talent for creating up-tempo piano songs, a skill that mostly went under the radar in her previous EDM. The bouncy and infectiously joyous songs that result are the Motown-influenced “Come to Mama,” as well as the saxophone- and piano-centric “Just Another Day.” Albeit a little too ingrained in the show tunes sound, these tracks effectively showcase Gaga’s talents as both an instrumentalist and a singer-songwriter.
The missteps in Joanne mostly occur when Gaga attempts to tackle slower, more emotional material. Perhaps in reaction to the overproduction that began to muddle her sound in Born this Way,  Joanne wisely refrains from flashy production, with the exception of the misguided outlier “Perfect Illusion.” However, the slower beats of Joanne are not always a plus. Gaga shines when she is given upbeat, fun music to tackle; conversely, in slower tracks like “Grigio Girls,” she sounds sluggish and even boring. Unfortunately, Joanne lacks the vibrancy of past offerings, threatening the quality that made her so refreshing upon her debut in the often paint-by-numbers pop industry. This carries over to Joanne’s many ballads, which expose Gaga’s tendency to oversing when she delivers more serious material; some examples of this are the dreary and strained “Angel Down” and “Million Reasons.” On the plus side, consistent with Joanne’s aim of stripping away Gaga’s pretenses, the album takes a dive into lyrical intimacy. This album, however, contains introspective songs like “Joanne,” a stripped-down tribute to Gaga’s deceased aunt, and “Diamond Heart,” which likely refers to the singer’s sexual assault when she was a teenager.  These tracks expose Gaga’s range as a songwriter and also her vulnerability as an individual, not simply an emblem of sexual empowerment and eccentricity.
Ultimately, Joanne is a polarizing album. On one hand, it seems that Gaga does all of the right things to reinvent herself; she highlights her vocals and addresses more intimate subjects. On the other, many fans may rightfully claim that Joanne feels like Lady Gaga trying to restrain herself. However, it is also Lady Gaga in transition, and the artist is still struggling to forefront this new, more authentic portrayal of herself while not completely discarding the exciting performer who captured the public imagination.

The line between news and entertainment has become increasingly obscured. The proliferation of media technology in the last 20 years has precipitated a veritable revolution in the ways the news is presented. Mobile phones and dot-com addresses have replaced the printed newspaper and television. These contemporary platforms have foregone the seemingly antiquated structures of the past in favor of stories that are prepackaged in short, entertaining segments. As the distinction between journalism and consumerism blurs, the question of how to appropriately present the news is all the more pertinent. Yet, it is often neglected. Although the information made readily available to the public often favors superficial analysis, consumers, particularly college students, have the power to demand more from the companies crafting the stories we want to know and understand.
Debate over how social media sites are adopted to present news stories arose last week when Al Jazeera and the U.K.’s Channel 4 used Facebook to post a live stream of Iraqi troops and Kurdish fighters descending into Mosul, the northern Iraqi city which has been under Islamic State control since 2014. The sight of emojis — cartoon faces expressing shock and anger, as well as the classic ‘thumbs up’ — fluttering across the Facebook footage was, for many, incongruous with the gravity of such an event.
The use of Facebook Live is certainly an editorial choice driven by the shifting demands of the consumer. Al Jazeera’s live feed of the Mosul assault received more than 875,000 views. For some, features such as Facebook Live are part of a natural evolution of how the media handles the demand for real-time information. In the 1990s, CNN changed the media landscape by broadcasting live audio of bombing raids during the Gulf War. Today, social media platforms like Twitter facilitate sharing both information and images in real time to millions of users. In the case of the Mosul assault, consumers — supporters of this evolution claim — include impressionable, potential sympathizers of the Islamic State. An editorial choice such as Facebook Live then becomes a means of combating the Islamic State’s propagandic narrative that it is undefeatable.
Detractors of this evolution, however, regard Facebook Live and its real-time relatives as evidence of how media platforms that are more committed to entertaining than informing the consumer have overtaken traditional platforms. The demand for not only real-time, but also mobile information has emboldened companies like Facebook and Snapchat to more confidently take on the role of news purveyor. Mobile advertising has grown by a factor of 30, reaching a value of about $32 billion in 2015. Facebook, for example, has strategically responded to the popularity of mobile content by occupying the news niche.
Traditional news sources have responded to the success of Facebook and its counterparts. Evidently, readers want news content that is instantaneous, mobile and entertaining. In an attempt to maintain their audiences, traditional outlets like The New York Times have invested heavily in video content. While the creative opportunities appear boundless, news sources should remember their mission and present stories in a fashion that appropriately fits the topic at hand.
If 90 percent of young adults use social media, then college students can significantly influence how news is presented in the future. As the main consumer audience of companies like Facebook, college students can demand information that is not only entertaining but also intelligent and thoughtful.

Presidential politics have gotten especially heated this time around. Accusations and insults are in no short supply as the presidential race reaches its climax, and meaningful discussion about policy is still lacking. The closest that we got to seeing civil discourse between the presidential nominees was in a series of presidential debates hosted by a trio of American universities. Last week’s presidential debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas focused for the most part on substantive issues — like the composition of the Supreme Court and the economy — that will undoubtedly affect the lives of millennials for several years to come. Unfortunately for voters, the discourse in this third debate was still largely limited in scope — before the debate devolved into a dynamic display of ad-hominem attacks and nonsensical claims.
Actually, using the term “civil discourse” to describe the presidential debates during this election might be wholly inaccurate. From deliberately speaking over debate moderators to interrupting the opposition with exclamations of “my turn” and several near-baseless accusations, it was clear to anybody watching the debates that this electoral season has more in common with stereotypical high school politics than a competition for the highest office in the United States. This is concerning for the future of professionalism in politics, but the lack of substance in the candidates’ arguments is even more worrying for the future that millennials will inherit.
From the very start of the debate about the Supreme Court, definition and clarity were difficult to uncover. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has not named any judges she would appoint to the Supreme Court. She did express her hope that President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, would be confirmed by the Senate, but offered little more than that. With the sole exception of the Citizens United case, Clinton has also not outlined specific judicial obstacles that must be overcome by the Supreme Court. She explained in vague terms that her Supreme Court nominees would “stand up” for women’s rights, the LGBT community and against unregulated campaign finance — that they would, in her words, “represent all of us.” Clinton also stated that she “support[ed] the Second Amendment,” but suggested that there is a “balance” between the respecting gun ownership and protecting life. Her failure to clarify the precise description of this balance has resulted in zealous gun owners growing increasingly concerned, but at first glance her statements also seemed to roll back her strongly worded comments about gun manufacturer liability for mass shootings dating back to the Democratic primary race.
Republican nominee Donald Trump came out in favor of justices that “will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.” Trump also expressed his opposition to the federal right to an abortion established by the Roe v. Wade decision. Given the composition of Trump’s list of judges, this was wholly unsurprising. Trump fumbled, however, when it came to in-depth discussion of controversial cases. Instead of explaining his legal reasoning, he pointed to how “extremely angry” Hillary Clinton was about the result of a particular case that defended gun rights, D.C. v. Heller.
The debate did not create a detailed discussion of judicial ethics or philosophy, as one might hope or expect. The most that the audience could reasonably hope to understand about the future composition of the Supreme Court was what they probably knew already: that there is a choice between a traditionally conservative court and an actively liberal one. Nothing new was revealed.
The candidates’ plans for improving the American economy were similarly vague and unsatisfying. The effects of market stagnation and instability in the immediate future will be felt most strongly not by those who are older and have secure jobs, but by the millions of millennials will enter the workforce in each upcoming year. The Social Security trust fund is expected to be unable to pay for all benefits by the 2030s, and Medicare is expected to suffer the same fate if the status quo is maintained. The only ways that these benefits can be secured for when millennials eventually retire is if revenue is raised, expenditures are slashed, or both.
However, neither candidate expressed their willingness to take that action. When asked about the problems with entitlement spending, Trump blamed the Affordable Care Act for those maladies. He then reemphasized that he would be cutting taxes, creating “tremendous jobs” and explained that his plan’s (unrealistically) projected 4 to 6 percent annual growth in the size of the American economy would take care of these issues by itself. Clinton’s plan, for her part, did not inspire confidence, either.
All in all, it appears as if American voters could learn very little of substance from these debates. Liberals will likely continue to find comfort in Clinton’s commitment to underprivileged minorities and experience, whereas conservatives will probably continue to reluctantly support Trump despite his flaws and cavalier antics. Undecided voters, on the other hand, are likely still as confused about who to vote for as they were a month ago. Undecided millennials in particular should make their choice wisely — our futures are on the line.
