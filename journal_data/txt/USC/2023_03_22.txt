Undergraduate Student Government senators voted 11-1 in Tuesday night’s meeting to extend current senatorial and cabinet terms through the end of the academic year. The last Senate meeting will take place April 25, the last Tuesday of the academic calendar, instead of April 4 as originally scheduled. The new Senate will be inaugurated April 25, and the 2023-24 senators will hold their first meeting immediately after.
Senator and 2023-24 vice president-elect Michelle Lu presented updates at Tuesday’s meeting on her projects, including providing medical supply vending machines in buildings on campus, updating to the LiveSafe app, integrating USCard with mobile wallets and issuing red cards to undocumented students. 
Medical supply vending machines will be available in Dauterive Hall and the Physical Education Building in six to eight weeks and accessible on campus 24/7, Lu said.
At the moment, Lu and senator Divya Jakatdar, the 2023-24 president-elect, are working on updating resources in the LiveSafe app — which provides points of contact and resources for students in times of crisis — and finding ways to spread awareness for the app. New students will be directed to download the app during orientation.
In regards to USCard digitalization, Lu worked with ITS senior enterprise architect Stewart Uyeda, who submitted a 2023-24 budget request Feb. 24 for a project manager to secure funding and is working to expand the integration. 
Lu said she is also looking at different ways to support undocumented students, who will be able to get red cards — paper slips that assert the holders’ rights, which have been helpful in confrontations with immigration agents. USG has ordered the cards, which will be available for students at the First Generation Plus Success Center in two to three weeks. 
Senator Sanjana Sambhwani also presented her project updates, including finding 24-hour dining options — such as a late-night food truck initiative, which Sambhwani said would also support local businesses. Sambhwani also said she identified a lounge and kitchen for RestSC, a project that aims to provide a space for commuter students to rest in between classes, as well as Moon Pods and lockers to store their items. 
“It’ll be a very nice space to just recharge … and commuter students will have to have a place to call home on campus that they’re on for long hours,” Sambhwani said. 
Sambhwani is also collaborating with USC Hospitality to provide dining options for students with dietary restrictions.

The University will no longer mandate coronavirus vaccinations for students, faculty and staff beginning Fall 2023, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
The change in policy comes as campus vaccination rates hit “close to 100%” for the primary vaccine series and 85% for the booster, prompting levels of immunity against severe disease, Van Orman said. 
“We still want people to get those vaccines we promote … but it becomes more of a personal healthcare decision,” Van Orman said. “We’re leaving this phase of the pandemic; we’re not going to see these huge numbers of hospitalizations and deaths that crash our healthcare system, because of the level of overall immunity.”
Advisors for the Food and Drug Administration endorsed Paxlovid Thursday as a beneficial coronavirus treatment, especially for adults at high risk for progression to severe illness, following an analysis that showed Paxlovid’s ability to significantly reduce hospitalizations and deaths in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
“We want to give [Paxlovid] to people who are at high risk, but are having mild symptoms …  because it can prevent that progression,” Van Orman said. “We don’t want to wait for people to have severe symptoms as there are other treatments that would be recommended.”
Van Orman noted that the number of total illnesses is higher after spring break than after winter or Thanksgiving break. Besides respiratory illnesses, such as influenza, coronavirus and the common cold, Van Orman said the most common illness is acute gastroenteritis, or stomach flu.
“The one that’s probably the most common, that causes what we worry the most about because it tends to cause outbreaks is caused by the norovirus,” Van Orman said. “Norovirus is when people say they have food poisoning, meaning they wake up, they feel nauseous, and they vomit and they get diarrhea, it’s really probably a viral infection with the norovirus”
Norovirus is incredibly contagious, Van Orman said, and people are susceptible to illness even when they are only infected by a small number of virus particles. Infections require specific cleaning products to expel, hence its association with outbreaks in places such as dormitories and cruise ships, Van Orman said.
“We’re actually going to be starting to do wastewater surveillance in our on-campus dorms,” Van Orman said. “The idea behind that is to find a few cases early, so that we can notify [USC] Housing to do enhanced cleaning to try to prevent outbreaks. By the time we start hearing … a lot of people saying, ‘I got sick, I’m sick,’ it’s often a little too late.”
Most cases of acute gastroenteritis are treatable at home with oral electrolyte solutions, Van Orman said. 
Overall, Van Orman stressed the importance of self-testing as the semester resumes, whether that be for respiratory illnesses or sexually transmitted diseases.
“We actually see a fair number of people coming in post-spring break with either concerns about sexually transmitted infections, exposures or symptoms,” Van Orman said. “So [I want to] remind people, if they have had a new partner over break, or someone they may not have known as well, that they make sure they come in and get themselves tested.”

This article is part of an ongoing series investigating Supreme Court cases slated for the current term and their impacts on the USC community. 
As the Southwestern United States continues to suffer a historical drought, legal battles rage on over the hierarchy for control of the water supply. In Arizona v. Navajo Nation, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday regarding what water rights the Navajo Nation is entitled. The Daily Trojan spoke with USC’s experts in law and western U.S. history about the case’s impacts on major Arizona cities, the Diné people and interstate relations surrounding the Colorado River Basin. 
Water laws in the Western U.S. follow what is known as prior appropriation, a first-come-first-served system wherein the first people to use a certain quantity of water from a source for “beneficial use” — a legal term encompassing irrigation and mining, among other purposes — are bestowed water rights over that quantity. Under the legal doctrine of prior appropriation, Indigenous tribes hold the most senior water rights. Yet, for many tribes, these rights have not been recognized nor quantified. 
“It’ll be an interesting case, because the trust that the United States owes to tribal nations has been ill-defined in law,” said Robin Craig, Robert C. Packard Trustee Chair in Law at the Gould School of Law. “The Navajo Nation, in particular, has been left without water for a very long time.” 
Arizona v. Navajo Nation came before the Supreme Court Nov. 4 after the states of Arizona, Nevada and Colorado and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — collectively called “Arizona” in the case’s title — appealed a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit decision to the Supreme Court. The appellate court’s ruling in 2021 provided that the Navajo Nation had a claim for breach of trust against the U.S. in accordance with an 1868 treaty that had promised sufficient land and water for the Diné. The 9th Circuit decision allows the Navajo Nation to continue to appeal their case and push for water rights. 
But despite the fact that Indigenous reservations have typically been established before the creation of the Western states, California currently holds the most senior water rights and is also entitled to the most water from the Colorado River — 4.8 million acre-feet worth. 
“Tribal water rights tend to be very senior,” Craig said. “When [tribal reservations] finally get their water rights acknowledged and quantified, they step in at the head of the line. That’s one reason why Arizona has not been anxious to settle these water rights, because it would put Tucson and Phoenix and all of Arizona agriculture way down the line in terms of who got water.”
Some of the doctrines concerning water rights today are as old as the states themselves,such as the prior appropriation doctrine and the Winter’s Doctrine. Over time, a patchwork of interstate compacts, treaties, Supreme Court cases, congressional statues, drought contingency plans and more have formed to create what is called the “Law of the River,” Craig said.
The 1922 Colorado River Compact, which initially overestimated the amount of available water, set the stage for water allotments to the lower basin states — California, Nevada and Arizona — and the upper basin states — New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming — and of Mexico. Tribal nations were not taken into consideration.
“It’s a question of, how do we reallocate the water when there’s less of it, but also honor the sovereign rights of either international nations like Mexico or the U.S., or sovereign nations like tribal entities, and then of course, many states that fall into the Colorado watershed?” said William Deverell, director of the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West.
Regardless, the Colorado River is in trouble. The Southwestern U.S. has been in a drought for the past 22 years, which would affect the 19 million people who get their supply from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Deverell said.
Residents of Diné lands have long faced environmental vulnerabilities spanning beyond droughts and climate change. Nuclear testing near Diné tribal lands after World War II rendered those living within them as ‘downwinders,’ because radioactive materials and waste floated “into the lungs, bodies, water streams [and] animals” of the Diné people, Deverell said. Compensable diseases and conditions for downwinders, as listed by the Health Resources and Services Administration, include leukemia, multiple myeloma and primary cancer of the pharynx, brain, stomach, thyroid, pancreas, liver and lung. 
“They get the short end of the environmental stick,” Deverell said.
Mining activities spanning over a century have also contaminated water sources flowing through Diné communities with selenium, among other toxins.
“This is an environmental and public health issue,” Deverell said. “There’s deep poverty on the Navajo reservation. These are very poor circumstances for the vast majority of these Indigenous people.”
The basin states have attempted — and failed — to agree upon one set plan to ration the water in recent months. Six of the states agreed upon a proposal, but California objected, citing its status as a senior water rights holder. The federal government requested that all states agree upon a proposal by Jan. 31. The impasse, however, has resulted in the federal government taking matters into its own hands. 
“Arizona has the largest concentration of tribes in the United States and the largest concentration of tribes that still do not have quantified water rights,” Craig said. “So it’s entirely possible that, if the Supreme Court decides in the Navajo Nation’s favor, there’s going to be a lot of lawsuits in Arizona that will result in some effective reallocation of water.” 
This Supreme Court case is expected to not split purely down ideological lines. Justice Neil Gorsuch, for example, has clashed with other conservative justices on expansion of tribal authority, of which he has consistently ruled in favor.
“We’ve got a little bit of a wild card in some of our justices who are normally thought of as conservative justices but tend to vote on the side of tribes,” Craig said. “The majority and dissent may not be the normal lineup.”
The current battles over water have major implications for the nearly 170,000 people living on the Navajo Nation, which Craig said is a “civil rights issue.”
“[It’s] not the ones we tend to focus on here in L.A. because we’ve erased the tribal presence here, but these are the original inhabitants of the U.S. and a lot of tribes like the Navajo Nation do not have the water they need to survive,” Craig said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Justice Neil Gorsuch’s position on tribal authority. He has consistently ruled for the expansion of tribal authority, not sometimes for and sometimes against. The article also misstated the number of people living on the Navajo Nation. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Sundown towns are all or overwhelmingly white areas of a residence that practice latent racial segregation by excluding people of color from moving to the area — especially the Black community. Roughly 10,000 have existed in American history. While researching these towns, author James Loewen only expected to find around a handful of these towns in his home state of Illinois but found more than 440 and thousands across the country.
Although landmark legislative endeavors, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, federally mandated desegregation and ostensibly enabled equal protection for all citizens, these residential areas continued to maintain a white population through discriminatory legislation or intimidation — oftentimes both. I was raised in such a town — a suburban neighborhood in upstate New York named Delmar. 
Minority narratives and perspectives are not monolithic, and my personal experiences should not be used to speak on behalf of entire demographics. However, it is undeniable that institutional racism permeates our interpersonal interactions, whether it be through microaggressions, disparities in privilege or more. 
Caesar, the last slave to be freed in New York State, was held on a farm 6 miles from my house. But the abolition of slavery didn’t prevent my town from practicing redlining, the commissioned racial segregation of neighborhoods through urban planning, in the 1930s. Even in 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education outlawed racial segregation in schools, several cities took decades and court-mandated desegregation to take any action. 
Not until the 1950s did Black families attempt to settle down in Delmar, facing significant opposition along the way. According to the Times Union, the first family to do so were the Cunninghams, who were unable to find a suitable place despite James Cunningham’s high-ranking position in the state Department of Health.  
“Every place they looked they were rejected on the basis of race,” said Miki Conn, Cunningham’s daughter, in an interview with The Daily Gazette. “Unless it was a ghetto neighborhood, they were turned away. There were fair-housing laws that had been passed around then, but it takes time for new laws to be implemented. I don’t know if there were specific laws against selling or renting to Blacks in Delmar back then, but they did have these protected real estate covenants. It was informal, but Delmar was all white.”
Although integration began after the Cunninghams’ arrival and Delmar is no longer officially considered a sundown town, the effects still clearly linger. The town is 92.6% white, and during my time at the high school, there had only been one Black teacher in the school’s 94-year-long history. This lack of representation among authority figures was a significant problem. Those residing in a bubble of whiteness couldn’t properly recognize racism, allowing racist actions to transpire. 
While there was an earnest effort to rectify these issues, it was an incredibly difficult cycle to break. If an environment doesn’t seem welcoming to a person of color, why would a person of color subject themselves to it? Ignorance tends to reign supreme and slip past the eyes of those who had the power to stop it. Elementary schools would stage all-white versions of Mulan, and white soccer players would style their hair into cornrows to hype up the school for a game. A handful of students of color, myself included, were sometimes singled out by the administration to consult and organize their reparation efforts. It felt as though I was living in a world where my homework was to study for my Spanish quiz and to solve centuries of institutional racism.
Although many high-profile cases of both institutional and interpersonal racial discrimination are concentrated in former confederate states, places like these exist all across America. Scapegoating southern America as “the racist region” negates the fact that George Floyd, Eric Garner and eight Black attendees of a supermarket in Buffalo were all murdered in the North. In 2020, Anti-Asian Hate Crimes rose by 361% in New York City alone. 
Ignoring the fact that institutional racism is a prevailing issue all across America promotes dangerous rhetoric that ignores an institutional problem and allows this kind of subtle racism to continue. Such environments allow perpetrators to slip through the cracks and allow those tragic events to occur. Society has greatly changed since the 1930s, but the roots of racism go much deeper than anyone could have ever imagined. Ultimately, just because the cycle wasn’t caused by us doesn’t mean that it isn’t our responsibility to break it.

This month, millions of California households on CalFresh will lose an average of $200 a month in government food assistance, even as food prices continue to rise.
CalFresh is California’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a federal program that helps more than 40 million low-income Americans buy groceries. While the federal government largely funds CalFresh and other SNAP programs, California oversees CalFresh’s administration and some aspects of eligibility. Benefits are loaded onto an Electronic Benefits Transfer card, which recipients can use to purchase food items at participating grocery stores. Prior to SNAP and EBT, food benefits were made possible through the Food Stamps Program and recipients would use physical stamps with monetary value. Since 2008, however, the government changed the name to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in part to emphasize nutrition, but also to reduce the stigma against users of food stamps and welfare.
At the onset of the pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act temporarily expanded eligibility requirements and approved emergency supplementary benefits. Since March 2020, households on Calfresh have received at least $95 extra in emergency allotments. 
In 2023, however, Congress set emergency allotments for all states to end by March. The Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service website explained in its announcement that “SNAP emergency allotments were a temporary strategy authorized by Congress to help low-income individuals and families deal with the hardships of the [coronavirus] pandemic.” 
Yet, Americans are still experiencing the economic consequences of the pandemic. When the United States economy reopened early 2021, the balance of the supply-demand chain broke, fueling inflation further. Last year, inflation caused food prices to increase by 10.8% in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. While policymakers can’t control global economics such as the war in Ukraine and environmental factors, SNAP is something they can control.
This abrupt policy change will severely impact CalFresh households, which encompass families, seniors,and college students. A single-person household could experience a drop in monthly benefits from $281 to $23 by April, even as food prices continue to rise and wages remain stagnant. Food banks, pantries and distribution programs are already seeing heightened demand and remain anxious about the future of their services as benefits end this month.
Given the extent of income inequality, we should be well past the days of arguing that individuals must pull themselves up by their bootstraps instead of relying on government handouts; yet the government’s logic implies that since we are no longer directly in a public health emergency, there is no reason for Americans to receive additional support. Ignoring for a moment the economic strain brought on as a result of the pandemic, is hunger not already a public health emergency?
Conservative lawmakers especially may have you believe that users of welfare are stealing dollars from taxpayers, yet this narrative is deeply disconnected from reality. One in eight Americans are dependent on SNAP. Inflation has skyrocketed. The federal minimum wage, on the other hand, is still $7.25, as it has been since 2009, and while California’s minimum wage is much higher at $15.50, corporate profit has far outpaced those increases — even as economists find those profits to be the driving force behind inflation. 
Clearly, scarcity is not the issue here: inequality is. While we should never be quick to ignore moral imperatives in favor of economic arguments, it is also worth considering that SNAP programs have an undeniably positive impact on the economy. SNAP stabilizes the economy, generates income in food supply and production and frees up funds for people to spend in other areas that further stimulate business. In a time of food insecurity and economic disruption, why has Congress chosen this time to end emergency allotments?
While “emergency” measures are not meant to last forever, policymakers must recognize that a “return to normalcy” approach in the post-pandemic world will only worsen inequalities already exacerbated by the pandemic. Although addressing the systems responsible for such glaring inequalities and food insecurity will take much more comprehensive action, we must protect, rather than restrict, vital programs such as SNAP. 
Proposals to expand the program such as lengthening time limits for proof of eligibility, eliminating the 20-hour outside work requirement for college students not on work-study and ending the prohibition of purchasing prepared foods must be a priority in this year’s Farm Bill, a major piece of legislation Congress passes every five years. In addition to expanding access to SNAP, Congress must reconsider allocations and increase allotments to their previous level. The hunger caused by systemic inequality and compounded by poor decision-making is a burden that neither families nor food pantries should bear alone.

Censorship in the United States is nothing new, though its targets have shifted over time. The earliest book bans in the United States were started by religious leaders. In 1650, a Massachusetts Bay colonist named William Pynchon published his pamphlet The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption in which he argued that people who followed Christian teachings would go to heaven. Puritan leaders did not favor the pamphlet and proceeded to denounce him as a heretic, burned his pamphlet and banned it. 
This continued throughout history; during slavery and the Civil War, many states outlawed literature that expressed anti-slavery sentiments, one very famous novel being “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Similar bans continued throughout history, with the Comstock Act of 1873 deeming it illegal to send “obscene, lewd or lascivious,” “immoral” or “indecent” publications through the mail, while also targeting those who possessed some form of literature or art deemed obscene. It aimed to prohibit discussing birth control and sexuality. Some books were banned and subsequently burned, including Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” and James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” 
Books continue to be banned and challenged, with the most recent occurrences happening in states aiming to eliminate literature surrounding queer studies, people of color and ultimately young people. Some states include Indiana, Florida, Texas and Tennessee, among others. 
As such, in honor of the marginalized groups represented in the books that are facing challenges, here is a list of books from Florida’s most recent book ban that you need to read.
1. “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood:
This novel argues that legally controlling women’s reproductive freedom is morally and politically wrong. This is depicted through the suffering of Offred and the other Handmaids. Handmaids are servants whose only purpose is to have children. From the dystopian perspective they lose all value once they no longer are able to carry children. It is banned in many states due to its profanity, sexual tones and being “anti-Christian,” among other reasons. The story is a powerful yet disturbing dystopian satirical piece of literature that shows a future U.S. a where women have been stripped of all their civil rights. Not ironically, this comes less than a year from when Roe v. Wade was overturned, an event which signifies a complete disregard for women’s health and rights by the Supreme Court. 
2. “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas:
An award-winning bestselling young adult novel, “The Hate U Give” is about the shooting of a young unarmed Black man by a white police officer. “The Hate U Give”, despite being important to the African American plight, was banned.  When looking at Gov. Ron DeSantis’s efforts to eliminate African American studies in the Advanced Placement curriculum, it is unsurprising that a book that gives a vivid image of what it’s like to be a Black man in the U.S. would be banned. 
3. “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” by Erika Sánchez:
This chilling New York Times bestseller follows a young woman named Julia, who navigates her grief following an accident that involved her sister and details the trauma she faces when her mother compares her two daughters. 
 “It was important for me, for young people of color, to feel seen by the book,” said author Erika Sánchez in an interview with NBC News. 
The book, due to its strong language and “negative” portrayal of religious faith, was unpopular among parents. The book is banned for its strong language and “negative” portrayal of religious faith. Unfortunately, while it is a rather grim topic, the stigma of depression wreaks havoc in many communities. By writing about suicidal ideation, Sánchez raises awareness in young Latine individuals. The fact remains that Hispanic teens, especially females, have higher rates of suicide compared to white or black teens, according to the CDC. 
4. “Dreaming in Cuban”by Cristina García:
This novel, which was originally banned in 2020, outlines the heroine’s journey of Celia del Pino and her family, who is forced to cope with their ever-changing Cuba in light of the Cuban Revolution and the emotional trauma that ensued. There is a tremendous overemphasized theme of family relationships and the divisiveness of politics. It sheds a unique light on Cuban history and culture by including critical historical events and elements of Santería, a popular religion in Cuba. “Dreaming in Cuban” was condemned for containing obscene and pornographic material and is no longer circulated. 
5. “The Female of the Species” by Mindy McGinnis:
This is a genuinely heartbreaking novel that takes readers on a harrowing but compelling journey regarding our society’s rape culture and violence against women. It focuses on Alex Craft, who had an older sister that was raped, killed and mutilated. The book ultimately is a feminist book that highlights the struggle of consistently trying to be the best while talking about the genuine and scary reality of what it is like to be a woman in the U.S.
6. “Nineteen Minutes” by Jodi Picoult: 
Picoult’s novel features two timelines: flashbacks and the present moment. It follows Peter Houghton’s life, with flashbacks showing the years of brutal bullying he endured to the present moment: when he decides to commit a mass shooting at his high school. This novel is controversial for its violence, sexual references and profanity. Something interesting to note is that 20 of Picoult’s titles were banned in Florida. 
Jodi Picoult, in an interview with The Hill, warned, “We’ve seen, historically, what the next chapter looks like when we don’t speak out against book challenges … and that story does not end well.”
Challenging and banning books has a tremendously negative impact on a society, often leading to a spread of xenophobia and overall ignorance. Young people should have access to unsensitized versions of history and books that expose them to new cultures and experiences because it allows them to think critically about the world.

Few operas hold as legendary a status as Mozart’s quintessential “The Magic Flute.” A crowning achievement of his miraculous compositional output in 1791, Mozart’s final opera maintains a towering presence in the landscape of classical music even centuries later. The engagingly imaginative plot, coupled with a richly colorful score, has captivated countless audiences as one of the most regularly performed works in opera houses around the globe.
Yet for all its popularity, “The Magic Flute” remains surprisingly static in its productional treatment. Like so many other great operas, modern fashionings of “The Magic Flute” typically fail to make any meaningful attempts at reinvention, symptomatic of the industry’s purist tendencies. The overwhelming inclination to treat operas as monolithic is extraordinarily damaging to opera houses’ public outreach. Combatting a chronic inability to draw new crowds, creatives in the field should prioritize accessibility and relatability.
Enter the Pacific Opera Project with a refreshingly original take on the operatic mainstay, inspired by video game franchises ubiquitous in today’s popular culture. Charmingly branded “Superflute,” POP’s revival of this production taps on the familiar heroes and villains of the arcade. The disarmingly witty reimagination aligns the content of the opera with the cultural conscience of contemporary audiences. 
Artistic Directors Josh Shaw and E. Scott Levin (cast as Papageno/Mario) co-wrote a new English libretto, connecting the original characters with their digital counterparts. 
“This is my childhood, growing up with Zelda and Mario — so it was not hard to come up with parallels,” Shaw said. 
In the leading role is Tamino Linkman, pining after a Zelda-like Pamina; “the plumber” Papageno is paired with Papagena Peach, and Sarastro Kong is pitted against The Queen of the Night, a female version of Ganondorf. 
Each transfiguration feels surprisingly natural, managing to roughly retain the same story of Mozart’s librettist Emanuel Schikaneder. Shaw and Levin succeed in crafting their own narrative, weaving in clever jokes and witty allusions. Delicately balancing between faithfulness to the historical component of the opera and the implementation of new additions, their adaptation satisfyingly revamps the plot while staying true to the general sentiments of the original. 
Crucially, audience engagement flourishes with the English remodelings. With this translated version, concertgoers make a direct connection with the singers — furthering both the dramatic and comedic elements of the opera.
“When someone’s delivering [their lines] in the language you speak, and you catch the nuance of the timing and the phrase … it’s just so much more immediate,” said Shaw. 
For all the changes made to the text of the opera, the music remains virtually untouched. The company sings with a small pit orchestra, taking pains to closely follow Mozart’s specific notation. 
“Clearly, Mozart’s the genius of ‘The Magic Flute’ … so we do stay completely true to the music,” Shaw said. 
Despite the occasional cut for durational purposes, “Superflute” retains a score just as challenging as any other production.
Thankfully, POP has assembled a cast well-equipped for the opera’s vocal demands. The company sings with exacting diction, virtually eliminating the need for supertitles (which, nevertheless, are still provided). Michelle Drever stands out for her fiery performance as Ganondorf/The Queen of the Night, delivering the coloratura with a power befitting the Zelda villain. Equally arresting is Andrew Potter as Sarastro Kong, with his enormous bass voice. Even smaller roles, like that of the three ladies, receive solid treatment from a consistently strong cast. 
Though the leads also contribute valiant vocal performances, they contribute most memorably in their acting. Arnold Livingston Geis plays Tamino/Link with an endearing heroism, yet even more captivating is Levin’s Papageno/Mario. Riffing on a nebulous sense of morality and a general ineptitude, Levin’s masterful comedic timing makes Papageno the true center of this production. 
Selling out El Portal Theatre, “Superflute” has drawn audiences that, particularly for opera, are excitingly diverse. 
When asked about the target audience for this production, Shaw simply said, “New people, adding that “[Superflute] is specifically designed to reach people who wouldn’t normally go to the opera. And it is definitely working because I see the ticket sales every day.” 
Democratizing a timeless Mozart work, POP welcomes all of Los Angeles through its doors with a dynamic view of opera’s possibilities.
Remaining presentations of “Superflute” are on March 24, 25 and 26 at El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood.

Welcome back from spring break!
Yeah, I know, probably no one wants to be back in school right now, especially since the end of spring break also means tests are right around the corner. But, as in most years, we can all at least rely on our memories of what happened during the break to carry us through the rest of the semester. 
Except, of course, if you’re like me and have some memories you’d rather forget. 
For anyone expecting some gossip over what I did in spring break, I’m sorry to disappoint. None of this relates to anything I personally did, but rather things that just coincidentally happened during the week I was on spring break. While this is my last spring break here at USC, I am too much of a prune to actually go out and risk embarrassing myself. 
Unless you count going out in an Anaheim Ducks jersey an embarrassment. 
Yes, the cat is out of the bag, I’m a Ducks fan. Don’t ask me how a Brazilian who first came into contact with hockey a year ago chose to cheer for a team that, to put it lightly, has been having a rocky season. These sorts of things just happened, and trust me on this, if I had a time machine, maybe things would have been different. But, sadly, this is the reality I live in. 
Now, even though I’m a newcomer to the sport, I know enough about the game to know that this is hardly a permanent thing. Teams usually go through a restructuring period, allowing them to bring in new talent and flip the situation around come the next season. And maybe, by this time next year, I’ll be thankful for owning so much merch instead of doubting my financial decisions. But as a fan, even though I know that our team will eventually get better, I can’t help but feel sad whenever we lose.
So you can imagine how I felt this Sunday when our hopes of making the playoffs were dashed by the Vancouver Canucks. 
I won’t go into too much detail. After all, this is not a hockey column. All you need to know is that, after coming hot off a win, we lost despite our best efforts. It was a depressing end to my spring break, to say the least. So, after moping around, I did what any committed fan would do: I booted up NHL 23 and won the Stanley Cup as the Ducks myself.
Oh, come on, don’t pretend as if you’ve never done something similar. If you love video games and sports, you’re bound to have done this after your favorite team has disappointed you. In fact, this is hardly the first time I’ve done something like this. Back when Brazil was eliminated from the World Cup, it took less than 20 minutes for me to absolutely destroy Croatia on FIFA 23, with a final score of 15-0. And let me tell you, I ran that game again and again until I had beaten them more times than I could count. 
Of course, this is all just helpless coping, but there is some fun in playing these games as a fan. You’re more invested in the outcome, and having some say in how the people you see on TV play is gratifying, even if none of the tactics you employed would actually work in real life. Paired with all the other added modes, such as building your own superstar team, these relatively simple games offer hours of genuine entertainment in ways that other genres struggle to. 
But I don’t have to defend these games. Odds are, if you’re reading the sports section, you’ve probably played them yourself already. After all, they are consistently on the list of the most-sold games of the year, even though their gameplay hardly ever changes. That is because, unlike most other games, sports games manage to bridge the gap and make non-gamers pick up the controller. You don’t need extensive knowledge of anything other than the sport you love to enjoy it.
But what is not often considered is how this low barrier of entry makes sports games the perfect two-way street; as much as they help get people into video games, they also make people care more about the sport. I say this because, as you can expect, it happened to me. 
You see, back when I was first getting into sports as a kid, I used FIFA as a way to navigate a complicated world of teams from my home country and abroad. Because the game was simple to understand, I felt quick gratification and began developing ties with the players I used. Suddenly, the names that I saw on the news started having some more weight to them, and the more matches I won against real opponents online, the stronger those ties became. Soon enough, I found myself buying tickets to go see real matches and tuning in on TV whenever my team was playing. 
My story is hardly unique. In fact, I imagine that nowadays, this narrative is all the more common. After all, you no longer have to even own the game to be influenced. Thanks to streamers and other internet celebrities, people from all kinds of life are exposed to these games and develop an interest in them alongside the streamer they are watching. 
Because of this exposure, sports games serve as the perfect case study of how successful partnerships can benefit everyone involved. Both the game, as well as the sport in question and the influencers who promote it, come out with a larger audience, all because of this mutually beneficial relationship. 
Of course, this doesn’t translate perfectly into the world of esports. Not every competitive game has the luck of featuring the likeness of top-class athletes, or has a relatively low skill barrier that allows people from all skill levels to enjoy it. However, the overall takeaway still remains. If a partnership is properly incorporated and not simply attached, the benefits for all parties will be well worth the extra cost. In a classic example, the game Fortnite, albeit not marketed as a professional-level game, benefits greatly from its multiple partnerships with different artists and products, which aid in engaging with an audience that might not have cared otherwise. 
This all sounds complicated, I know, but I encourage you to pick up one of these sports games and test out my theory yourself. If it works, you don’t even need to like the sport to begin with. By playing it, you’ll naturally find yourself caring more about it, and sooner or later, odds are you’ll become a fan. If you do decide to test them out, just a word of advice: Whatever you do, don’t play as the Ducks in NHL 23. Speaking from experience.

Two rounds down. Four more to go. March Madness for men’s and women’s basketball is in full swing, and the madness has not disappointed. Upsets, comebacks and buzzer-beaters have characterized another year of postseason basketball. Here are some of the main takeaways from the first weekend of the tournaments and what to look forward to heading into the final stretch. 
USC Trojans
Both men’s and women’s basketball suffered tough losses in their first round of play, ending their championship hopes earlier than some expected. Disappointing ends to senior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson’s illustrious USC careers marked the men’s 72-62 loss to the Michigan State Spartans. The two combined for only 17 points, shooting just 7-24 from the field. The Trojans never looked their best for the entire game and could not keep up with the Spartans’ balanced offensive attack. 
The women’s team battled against the South Dakota State Jackrabbits in an overtime affair that saw the Jackrabbits grind out the 62-57 victory. Despite the best efforts of graduate student guard Destiny Littleton and sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, the Trojans committed too many fouls in overtime, allowing SDSU to knock down easy points at the free throw line. 
Despite the losses, USC basketball was able to send both men’s and women’s teams to the tournament and carried impressive regular season records.
Outside of USC’s performances, the two tournaments were full of highlight-worthy moments. 
The Men’s Tournament
The blue bloods of college basketball had a tough weekend of postseason basketball. The Kentucky Wildcats, Duke Blue Devils and Kansas Jayhawks, typically dominant programs, all lost before the Sweet 16. Let’s also not forget that the North Carolina Tar Heels failed to even make the tournament, despite playing in the championship in 2022. The only blue blood left standing is the UCLA Bruins, who now face a tough opponent in the Gonzaga Bulldogs led by senior forward Drew Timme. Timme racked up 28 points in the Bulldogs’ nail-biter against the TCU Horned Frogs. 
Some amazing upsets have complemented the break in tradition to the dismay of those in Las Vegas or fans wishing to predict a perfect bracket. The No. 13 seed Furman Paladins stunned the No. 4 seed Virginia Cavaliers 68-67 in the first round of the tournament. It would be hard to make up how the Cavaliers squandered their late lead. A perfectly-executed full-court press led to a Cavalier turnover, setting a game-winning three-point bucket for the Paladins.
An even crazier upset occurred later in the week when the No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson Knights knocked off championship-hopeful and No. 1 seed Purdue Boilermakers 63-58. Only the second No. 16 seed in history to win a game in March Madness, the Knights stormed the court after the miraculous upset that has been the highlight of the tournament thus far. 
Another amazing story has been the Princeton Tigers, who not only took down the Pac-12 champion Arizona Wildcats 59-55 in the first round, but went on to beat the No. 7 seed Missouri Tigers in dominant fashion, 78-63. They now have a chance to continue writing their Cinderella story with a win against the Creighton Blue Jays on Friday. 
Despite the many upsets, a few juggernauts remain poised for deep pushes in the tournament. The Alabama Crimson Tide continue to dispel the narrative that Tuscaloosa is only a football town, romping their first two opponents. They will now face the scrappy San Diego State Aztecs in the Sweet 16. On the other side of the bracket, the Houston Cougars picked up two quality wins of their own and will face off against the Miami Hurricanes. If they win, they could face another regional stalwart, the Texas Longhorns. 
It is clear that although the first two rounds of Men’s March Madness were filled with upsets, the underdogs will now have the challenging task of facing the best of the best in the rounds to come. 
The Women’s Tournament
On one hand, the women’s tournament has been pretty predictable. The South Carolina Gamecocks have shown zero signs of breaking their perfect season, cruising through the first two rounds with ease and showcasing exactly why they are the clear favorites in this tournament. Familiar faces such as the UConn Huskies, Tennessee Volunteers and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish have also had solid wins so far. Iowa’s star junior guard Caitlin Clark continues to bury three-point shots for the Hawkeyes, leading them into the Sweet 16. 
On the other hand, the women’s tournament has been just as crazy as the men’s.  Many experts thought the Cardinal were a surefire deep-run team, but they were knocked off in the second round by the Ole Miss Rebels 54-49, despite shooting a higher percentage from the field. The Princeton Tigers pulled off an impressive upset in the first round of play, and npt just the men’s team. The Tigers upset the No. 7 seed NC State 64-63 after an amazing game-winning shot by senior guard Grace Stone. The No. 1 seed Indiana Hoosiers suffered a heartbreaking loss in the second round, when the No. 9 seed Miami Hurricanes knocked down a jumper with 3 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, preventing the Hoosiers from attempting a final shot. 
The undefeated Gamecocks remain the heavy favorites heading into the Sweet 16. But if the first two rounds have proven anything, it is that nothing is a guarantee until the final buzzer rings. 
Both tournaments resume play this week, with the men’s kicking off March 23 and women’s March 24.
