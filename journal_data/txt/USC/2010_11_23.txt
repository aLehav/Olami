With the goal of teaching a wide array of students basic information about biology and genetics, two USC professors produced an educational DVD titled A Tale of Two MAO Genes: Exploring the Biology and Culture of Aggression and Anxiety.
Marsha Kinder, a professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, and Jean Shih, a professor in the School of Pharmacy created the interactive DVD, which has also been translated into Mandarin for a students in Taiwan and Beijing.
Shih began using the DVD in her classes this semester, but Kinder said that they are still waiting to hear what students think about the DVD.
“USC should be a place where we have an institute of a collaboration of science and the arts,” Kinder said.
The two professors are the only two female “University Professors” at USC, a title given to recognize faculty for doing innovative interdisciplinary research.
Their goal was to teach students basic information about biology and genetics, as well as talk about Shih’s story and her career. Kinder and Shih wanted to make science education more compelling and more engaging to students, Kinder said.
“It’s taken us a long time to make this,” Kinder said. “We saw this as a model, and indeed now USC is doing a lot of projects [similar to this.]”
The pair proposed the project in 2005, and received funding from then-provost Lloyd Armstrong and started working on the project in 2006.
The project focuses on Shih’s 30 years of research on an important pair of brain enzymes, the MAO A and MAO B (monoamine oxidase) genes, which help control aggression and anxiety in mice. Kinder said they not only wanted to focus on biological information, but cultural aspects of the target audience as well.
“We like to present these findings artistically, at a level which students and the general public will understand and will be benefited from them,” Shih said.
The DVD not only comes from a collaboration of Kinder and Shih, but also from The Labyrinth Project at the School of Cinematic Arts and The Shih Brain Research Laboratory at the School of Pharmacy. In 1997 Kinder founded the Labyrinth Project, a research initiative on database narrative and digital scholarship, which has produced 12 projects similar to this so far.
Kinder and Shih wrote the content of the DVD together, and the animation was done by the students. According to Kinder, the two key artists in the group were Kristy Kang and Rosemary Comelia.
The DVD, which contains six hours of content, was made to be interactive and simple to use. Kinder said that they wanted the DVD to be utilized at many different levels, including middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate school.
PDFs of articles related to the topics are also available.
“[People are] absorbing the information in modular units, with a glossary, outline and video clips all in the same screen,” Kinder said. “There’s a glossary as the video clips are going. You can stop at any point and look at the glossary and definition [of a term related to the clip.]”
The images in the DVD are presented in a variety of ways. There are live action shots, such as when Shih is in the lab with fighting mice, as well as 3D images and cartoon-like images. Kinder said the animator worked hard to understand what the images were supposed to look.
“What people generally say about [the images] are that they are very beautiful and they are also very rigorously accurate,” Kinder said. “It’s the idea that the issues of representation are very important in science and in art.”
One part of the DVD features the ethics of science, which is set up as a quiz in order to provoke classroom discussions. This area also features differing views on issues of religion and philosophy. Faculty in the departments of religion, philosophy and medical school are featured in the DVD.
In 2007, the National Conference of China invited Kinder and Shih to present their DVD. After the presentation, they received a grant from the National Council of Taiwan to collaborate with a Taiwanese university to create a Mandarin version.
“This innovative science education tool is powerful, it is more effective and interactive,” Shih said. “I hope it will stimulate students’ interest in science and will help them to make their career choice.”

Two-unit conversational Spanish and French classes have been added to the spring schedule of courses, allowing students to take a class that focuses more on speaking Spanish or French than learning the grammatical rules, Undergraduate Student Government leaders said.
Native tongue · Nathalie Burle, a language professor in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, teaches a French class in Taper Hall. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The classes, Conversational Spanish (SPAN 280x) and Intermediate Conversational French: Culture, Society, and Communication (FREN 235x), are described as a “discussion of short films, cultural and literary texts and other activities designed to improve conversation skills,” according to the spring 2011 schedule of classes.
Liz Trower, USG senior director of communications, said this is a huge victory in what has been a three-year push for improved two-unit classes.
“This actually is part of what has been a much longer initiative in USG to improve two-unit courses,” Trower said. “This is the first major victory and hopefully it will pave the way for improvement in other two-unit courses.”
When Andrew Matson, chief justice pro tempore of the USG Judicial Council, was the assistant director two years ago, he brought up the issue of two-unit classes.
“We took an all-levels approach to bring in more two-unit courses to USC,” Matson said
A survey was sent out two years ago to students to gauge interest in two-unit courses. USG said it received an overwhelmingly positive response to the addition of a two-unit conversation language courses.
Matson said when he became the director of academic affairs for USG, he was in close communication with administrators, the Office of Academic Records and Registrar, as well as the sitting vice provost to continuously push for two-unit courses.
However, Ravi Agarwal, USG director of academic affairs, said it was difficult to actually add the courses to the course list.
“The biggest obstacle is time,” Agarwal said. “We can see the student demand, but conveying that demand to administrators and convincing them has also been a big issue and kind of a challenge for us as well. There are a lot of steps involved that require a lot of coordination.”
These classes are being offered for Spring 2011 and will not be for credit for Spanish or French majors.
“We not only hope to get more two-unit classes in the Spanish department,” Agarwal said, “But we hope to basically take what the [foreign language department] has done and help other departments do the same and offer similar classes in other languages.”

On Nov. 1, tickets were supposed to on sale for the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con. Unfortunately, the site crashed then, forcing Comic-Con International to move registration to today.
Yet, the machines seemed set on repeating history, and another technical error caused the overseers to shut the site down once more.
Beyond the technical issues, the rush for tickets is another sign of the continual growth of Comic-Con. Although many people claim that comics are increasingly being pushed aside by film and television at the event, and anyone who has seen the lines for the Hollywood-dominated Hall H can definitely see the validity of that argument, Comic-Con attendance has grown — now to more 130,000 people.
Comic-Con International has yet to schedule a third attempt at ticket sales, but more than likely it won’t be until December. When it does go up, be sure to be up early to grab a ticket, as when the site works, they sell out very quickly.
Hopefully, for fans, the third time is the charm.

It’s not often that a line forms five hours before an event.
The excitement surrounding Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s appearance at USC was already evident by 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon, when students were staking their spots in line for the 8:30 p.m. talk at Bovard Auditorium.
Kastalia Medrano | Daily Trojan
When the lights dimmed, signaling the start of the program, the auditorium could have been confused with a Justin Bieber concert, as deafening shrieks from amorous coeds shattered the eardrums of all those in attendance.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the star of (500) Days of Summer and Inception, recently embarked on a college tour on behalf of his website, hitRECord.org, which he began in order to create a community for aspiring artists.
HitRECord is a forum for artistic collaboration via the Internet.
Similar to YouTube, users can post videos, images and stories and then collaborate with other filmmakers, writers and illustrators.
The projects become compilations of work that can be modified by users, putting the creativity into the hands of the hitRECord community.  Gordon-Levitt considers himself the director of the site, occasionally picking up projects to participate in.
Gordon-Levitt aired several videos from the site, including a short film called Morgan and Destiny’s Eleventeenth Date.
The video is one installment in a series originally written by a HitRECord user under the pseudonym Metaphorest. Gordon-Levitt showed interest in the story by taking an active role in its realization in becoming a short film. He narrated the storyline and acted out the plot with friend and collaborator Lexy Hulme.
The video was uploaded to the hitRECord and worked on by illustrators and animators to create a full composite edit that was screened at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.
Though the program was shaped to promote hitRECord.org, Gordon-Levitt addressed a few questions about his acting career.
He took a unique approach to audience participation. Attendees were invited to submit questions via Twitter, which he answered throughout the talk, allowing for a real-time Q&A without the hassle of forming lines in Bovard.
When asked about the difficulties breaking into the entertainment industry, Gordon-Levitt told the audience members that taking a proactive approach by creating their own audience would be, in many ways, more effective than waiting for a “big break.”
“I don’t have any really great news or any secret handshakes to offer you … but I would definitely say if you’re really serious about becoming a professional actor, do not neglect doing it yourself,” he said. “Do not just wait for somebody to say ‘You got the part’ because I just think you’ll be a lot more fulfilled in yourself and your creativity if you do that as well as make your own stuff.”
During his college tour, Gordon-Levitt has received criticism by those who saw his program as an unabashed publicity stunt. But at USC, his talk was generally well-received by students.
“I think it’s awesome. It’s pretty innovative. I’ve never heard of anything like that, like complete collaboration of people online,” said Drake Smith, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies. “So I think it’s a great thing. It allows people — like they might not be able to get into the actual industry, but they can still contribute.”
Gordon-Levitt’s call for creativity inspired all of its attendees — from the artistically inclined to the creatively inept.
“I’m not an artist, [but] I think it’s a great concept, and maybe I will try it,” said Will Roper, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering.

Electronic duo The Crystal Method, composed of Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland, released its newest project The Sine Language EP on Nov. 16. The Sine Language EP is a compilation of remixes of the single “Sine Language” featuring electro-hop duo LMFAO, from the Crystal Method’s fourth studio album, Divided By Night.
Producers such as Richard Vission, Omega, Von Ukuf, Future Funk Squad, Moonbeam, Datsik and Metasyn reworked “Sine Language” to add varying sounds to the original track. The track was initially a lighthearted single with the goofy lyrics characteristic of LMFAO, the group behind the popular party tracks “I’m In Miami Bitch” and “Shots,” paired with intense and wobbling beats.
The Sine Language EP begins with the single edit of “Sine Language,” a track that warms up the listener before the more intense tracks that follow. The focus of this track is less on the beat and more on the featured group.
The relatively simple beats go well with the vocal line, ridiculous rhymes that the listener will find hard to take seriously, such as At the club the line is long / How long? / About as long as my ding-illy-dong.
The next track, a remix by Richard Vision, brings a darker feel with a stronger, quicker bass and more percussion. It is one of the most successful remixes, cleverly pairing LMFAO’s lines and the beat. The listener only hears the first few lyrics of the song, so the aim of this track seems to be to get the crowd moving, not feature the artists.
Following the Vision remix is an adaptation by Future Funk Squad. This track has a more ethereal, less intense feel. It begins with a synthesized instrumental introduction, followed by LMFAO’s first lines of Blast that sh-t into outer space, repeating until the bass is dropped.
The Moonbeam remix of “Sine Language” follows, and begins with haunting sound effects then slowly escalates until an instrumental melody is introduced. Throughout this track, the vocal line is completely distorted: rewound, fast-forwarded and slowed.
Additions to the track such as sounds of cheering fans increase the complexity of texture, though not necessarily the quality of the remix.
Well-known dubstep producer Datsik’s remix follows this, beginning with LMFAO’s rap sped up over a growing siren sound. Datsik’s remix is characteric dubstep, with a wobbling bassline and thick instrumentals.
Although a successful remix, the distorted bass line is able to stand alone — the vocals add to the texture of the track but are overshadowed by the manipulation of the beat.
Following Datsik’s remix is one by Metasyn, presenting a completely different mood. It begins with a much more mainstream and catchy guitar line. A weaker beat makes this track a different kind of dance track; the light-hearted mood relates best to the ridiculous vocal line.
The Omega remix is next on the EP, and brings back the darker mood of Datsik’s remix. Although successful in adding unique features such as loud talking in the background of the track, Omega’s remix has little variation — the same beat is repeated throughout, and the vocals are heavily processed but not made any more interesting.
Von U-KUF’s remix is the second to last on the album, and provides a refreshing take on “Sine Language.” It begins with a simple beat, adds synthesized instrumentals and then layers multiple parts of LMFAO’s line on top of itself. This is a lighthearted remix, reminiscent of Daft Punk’s optimistic “One More Time.”
Ending the album is the Dylan Holshausen remix, thick with percussion and rewound vocals. The variation of the synthesized melodies paired with contradicting big beats and tinny percussion makes it quite a successful and intriguing track. It is easy to picture crowds moving to this song, which would fit in at any rave or party.
Despite the creative attempts of all the producers, The Crystal Method’s overall dark and hardcore sound would be better represented with a different selection — the ominous feel of Divided by Night and other previous albums is completely missing from this EP.
The remixes could have been more interesting with a different, stronger rap as well as a more serious feel that better matched the accompanying music.
However, the EP does present a great variation of remixes that will get the crowd dancing. LMFAO’s joking lyrics and partying attitude added to The Crystal Method’s electronic roots create a pairing that will appeal to a wide variety of listeners.

This comes as no surprise that the Women of Troy’s (24-4, 13-4) final game of the season would come against a team ranked ninth.
Front lines · Sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller (22) and freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard jump to block a spike from a UCLA player. The duo have made their presence felt on the court this season for USC. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Not to mention, that team is UCLA.
The Women of Troy face off with the No. 9 Bruins (21-7, 11-6) Friday at 5 p.m. in Westwood. USC took the team’s first matchup of the season in four sets two months ago, capping a 12-0 run to open the season.
Now, the Women of Troy are on a similar tear. Though no longer undefeated, USC has lost just once since Oct. 16, and that was at then-No. 3 Stanford. In that time, the Women of Troy have defeated six ranked teams, including a road victory at the No. 2 California.
Most recently, the team is coming off back-to-back sweeps of the Washington and Oregon schools and still has an outside shot at winning the Pac-10.
“We’re getting better at the right time,” USC coach Mick Haley said.
The Women of Troy currently sit at third in the Pac-10, while UCLA is fourth. Cal tops the conference with a 14-2 record, and Stanford is second at 13-3. USC would need to beat UCLA and have both Cal and Stanford be swept by the Arizona schools to win the conference, but the possibility is still there.
Regardless, the Women of Troy are a shoo-in to reach the NCAA tournament for the 20th consecutive season, but they still treat every game as something to compete for.
“Any win … gets us closer to a very good bid in the NCAA tournament,” Haley said.

After a resounding 11-5 win over No. 6 UC Irvine to cap off the regular season on Saturday at Anteater Pool in Irvine, Calif., the No. 2 USC men’s water polo  team will travel north to begin an even more imposing challenge.
Following a regular season in which the Trojans (23-2, 6-2) stumbled just twice, the youthful bunch will face No. 7 seed UC Santa Barbara Friday in the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament, with the winner advancing to the semifinals.
Initially, USC will face a familiar Gaucho team, one that it has been able to dispose of on two separate occasions in 2010.
In early October, the Trojans faced Santa Barbara in the semifinals of the SoCal Tournament. After a strong opening frame, USC ballooned its lead to a 4-0 margin before watching it nearly collapse after five unanswered goals from the Gauchos. Eventually the Trojans secured a 7-6 win, but strong play from Santa Barbara certainly left a visible impression.
“They played well,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said at the time. “They have quite a few experienced foreign players and are really tough.”
The Gauchos later traveled to McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Oct. 24 for a conference matchup, and the result was a 13-9 victory in favor of the host Trojans.
But despite a level of comfort with a seventh-seeded UCSB opponent, the Trojans aren’t looking ahead to a possible matchup with crosstown rival No. 3 seed UCLA in the semi-finals.
Instead, they claim to be focused on notching yet another victory over their neighbors to the north.
“Santa Barbara, in my opinion, is one of the best teams in the country,” Vavic said. “They’re strong and have very good kids. They are right behind us in terms of team defense this year.”
But offense, however, might be Santa Barbara’s strong suit in the end. The Gauchos feature a senior utility in Milos Golic, who currently has amassed 53 goals on the season — second highest in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation — and collectively, they are coming off an 11-goal effort in their season finale against Pepperdine.
Golic, though, will be forced to contend with an equally skilled MPSF leader in USC’s Joel Dennerley, a junior goalie ranked first in the conference in goals allowed per game with 5.2.
Vavic continues to call Dennerley the best goalie he has ever coached during his 17-year stint at USC.
If successful against Golic and the Gauchos, Dennerley and company will move within two games of an MPSF Tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, which is scheduled to begin Dec. 4 in Berkeley, Calif.

How things can change in a week.
Last week I wrote that USC was on track for a 10-win season and that it would finish the season on a roll much like it has in previous years.
Now, everything that seemed so certain a week ago is mired in doubt.
Everything changed after the Trojans suffered their most embarrassing loss of the season, a 36-7 whacking by Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore. Not only did they lose another game in the state of Oregon, but they seemed to have lost their mojo. Any momentum built up by two tough wins over the Arizona schools has been squandered.
Whereas last week we were talking about a double-digit win total and a sense of improvement over last year’s measurable dip, now we have to face the reality that this season could get ugly.
Forget 10 wins. Can the Trojans even reach eight?
The only way to sell what remains of this fractured season is that the Trojans can still beat their two rivals in their final two games. Notre Dame and UCLA have been anything but impressive this year, so USC should be the favorite. But who knows what the fallout is going to be from last week’s debacle.
Most importantly, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s status is questionable after he suffered a high-ankle sprain that forced him to miss the entire second half against the Beavers. Barkley’s status is still up in the air, opening the door for senior quarterback Mitch Mustain to start his first game at USC.
Mustain’s performance in the second half last week, however,  was not encouraging. He finished with only 60 yards on 8-for-17 passing, without a touchdown or an interception.
This is not to say that Mustain is not a capable leader of the offense. He, after all, has been learning it since he transferred here in 2007. And he is undefeated as a starter, going 8-0 as a freshman at Arkansas before transferring to USC.
For the naysayers who have been calling for Mustain to get his shot even before Barkley went down, I’m sorry to disappoint you. The Trojans are a much better team with Barkley at the helm.
But if Barkley can’t go, Mustain is still a capable backup. It’s beyond that where it gets a little hairy.
The No. 2 quarterback will likely be walk-on John Manoogian, who has never taken a snap in a college game. Freshman Jesse Scroggins will likely not be available because the Trojans do not want to waste his redshirt year.
What does this all mean? If Barkley can’t go, Trojan fans should be praying to the football gods that Mustain doesn’t go down as well.
Injuries and disillusion in the rest of the backfield only add to USC’s woes. Junior running back Marc Tyler reinjured his sprained ankle and was unable to finish the game against Oregon State.
Senior tailback Allen Bradford has been plagued by fumbles this season. Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter, who did not make the trip to Corvallis because he allegedly accepted a golf cart ride from an agent, is awaiting reinstatement.
That leaves senior tailback C.J. Gable, who scored the Trojans’ only touchdown against the Beavers.
USC’s offense has been the lynchpin of the team all year. Before nearly laying an egg last week, the Trojans were scoring more than 35 points a game, winning games in spite of their spotty defense.
So the prospect of USC playing its final two games with backups at quarterback and running back means the Trojans might have to gnash and claw their way to wins in games that were supposed to be breezes.
Notre Dame, although just 6-5 this season, has dominated its last two games against Utah and Army. They have momentum on their side and a freshman quarterback in Tommy Rees who is playing with confidence.
The Bruins, meanwhile, make USC’s troubles seem nitpicky. UCLA is in total disarray after an embarrassing loss to Washington and has quarterback issues of its own.
Overall, all hope is not lost for USC. There is still time to salvage some kind of hope from this season.
But after the weekend USC had in Corvallis, there are no guarantees anymore.

It’s safe to say this game is not what it used to be.
The USC-Notre Dame clash at the Coliseum on  Saturday night pits two struggling teams from very proud football schools against each other in a game with little consequence for the postseason. For the first time since 2001, both teams enter the game unranked.
Hot seat · Senior backup quarterback Mitch Mustain was forced to fill in on Saturday after sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was injured. Mustain will most likely start on Saturday against Notre Dame, though he has never started a game for the Trojans. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
USC (7-4) is coming off another loss in the state of Oregon after a 36-7 drubbing by Oregon State last week. The Trojans were held scoreless in the first half and held to the fewest points in a game since 2001.
To make matters worse, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, who is ninth in the nation with 25 touchdown passes, went down with a high-ankle sprain just before halftime. Even though the X-rays came back negative, his availability for this week’s game is in doubt.
That leaves senior backup quarterback Mitch Mustain to make his first start for the Trojans and lead the USC offense against a Notre Dame team that is coming off its two strongest performances of the year.
The Fighting Irish (6-5) are struggling to maintain a winning record in coach Brian Kelly’s first year at the helm, and it seems like he’s got the team heading in the right direction as Notre Dame enters its final game of the regular season.
The Fighting Irish have held their last two opponents, then-No. 15 Utah and bowl-eligible Army, to just three points each and are looking to pounce on a sputtering Trojan offense.
The USC running game, which looked to be one of the best and deepest in the country earlier this season, is jogging in place. USC gained just 120 yards on the ground against Oregon State and its leading rusher, senior CJ Gable, hasn’t had a carry since USC’s 48-14 blowout of Cal and its other three running backs all have issues. Senior Allen Bradford has fumbling issues, redshirt junior Marc Tyler is running on an ankle he keeps hurting and might miss another week of practice this week, and freshman Dillon Baxter didn’t travel to Oregon State because of accepting a ride in a golf cart with an NFL agent.
This game is the last game many USC seniors will play at home. Bradford, Gable, fullback Stanley Havili, wide receivers Ronald Johnson and David Ausberry, center Kristofer O’Dowd, cornerback Shareece Wright, linebacker Malcolm Smith and kicker Joe Houston will all be making their final appearances at the Coliseum as Trojans.
Even with no bowl positioning on the line, the players will still be anxious to beat their team’s longtime rival.
“It’s Notre Dame,” sophomore offensive tackle Matt Kalil said. “That right there is enough motivation … We’re looking to go play our butts off and bust out these last two wins and finish the season on a good note.”
FIGHT ON TROJANS!!! BEAT THE IRISH!!!
The battle of two first year coaches. This game will be a portent of the next three years.

This weekend the USC men and women’s diving team found significant success after traveling to Arizona for the Wildcat Invitational.
Junior Victoria Ishimatsu brought home first place, and sophomore Ariel Rittenhouse third place, in the 1-meter competition for the Women of Troy on Saturday. On the men’s side, junior Harrison Jones and senior Steven Starks both reached the final of the 3-meter, while senior Greg Miller placed 20th and 24th in the 1-meter and 3-meter qualifying rounds, respectively. Starks also won the platform title on Sunday.
The invitational was successful for both USC dive teams, and diving coach Hongping Li explained why it was important to the Trojans.
“We are not really in season yet, so [the Wildcat Invitational] was not critical, but it is important,” Li said. “We learned where we were in terms of competitors, and saw if we were leading or if we were behind.”
Ishimatsu won the 1-meter with a score of 319.50, almost 20 full points ahead of the second-place winner, Samantha Pickens of Arizona (290.65). Ishimatsu also won the consolation final of the 3-meter competition, securing multiple victories for USC.
The team was forced to deal with difficult weather conditions — the wind was noticably strong and the air was extremely dry. But despite the challenge, Ishimatsu said the team was able to focus and perform.
“Our strengths [in the Invitational] were our ability to push through the rough conditions of a really long contest, wind and dry weather,” Ishimatsu said.
Jones placed fourth in the final of the 3-meter, with a score of 365.95, while Starks was came in seventh place at 333.55 points. Starks’ win of the platform title over Arizona’s Andre Guerra by one point was also a highlight of the weekend, while Jones placed third in the platform final.
“Overall our team did well with the difficult conditions. There were a lot of participants, the most I have ever seen in an event,” Ishimatsu said. “I think what we took away from the competition was that … we can’t control the weather or how many divers are in the contest but we can control ourselves.”
The dive teams, along with the men and women’s swim teams, will next participate in the U.S. Nationals in December.
“Our team is very elite this year,” Li said. “I am hoping to see a very mature performance throughout the season coming up.”
