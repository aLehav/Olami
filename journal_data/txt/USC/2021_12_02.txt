On Nov. 28, LVMH announced on Twitter that Ghanian-American designer Virgil Abloh, CEO of luxury streetwear brand Off-White and men’s artistic director of Louis Vuitton, had passed away from a rare form of cancer.
To say this disrupted the fashion world is an understatement, as his private battle was exactly that — private. Reminiscent of Chadwick Boseman’s death in August 2020, the sudden death hit the community hard.
Celebrities mourned their friend, celebrating his life and his impact. While some impacts were culturally influential, such as learning to seize rare opportunities as fashion influencer Wisdom Kaye recalled on Twitter, some of Abloh’s impacts were intimate. Hailey Bieber mourned the loss of her friend and designer of her custom wedding gown on Instagram, just as FULLY, founder of rising U.K. brand House of Errors, did on his story, thanking Abloh for inspiring “us regular people to get in the industry.” 
However, Abloh’s career wasn’t smooth sailing. Of course, with success comes scrutiny, and there has always been a lot of hate for his unorthodox background and rumors of his unoriginality. 
Firstly, his background. 
He received a bachelor’s degree from University of Wisconsin-Madison for civil engineering and a master’s in architecture from Illinois Institute of Technology. Even someone who is new to the world of fashion understands that to have such a dynamic and explosive career without any formal training is very rare. 
Other iconic designers that have chalked their brand design down to specific concepts and motifs, such as Abloh’s circular cutouts and quotations, all had formal training. For example, there is Alexander McQueen, the Central Saint Martins graduate, with his signature skulls. Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Pansczczyk, founders of AREA, the brand known for their signature crystal embellishments on their couture garments, both graduated from Parsons.
Instead, Abloh credits his architectural background to his artistic eye and vision. It is important to dispel here that while his path to fashion was extremely strange, he did grow up learning how to sew from his mother who was a seamstress. 
Second, his supposed lack of originality. 
Before I get into LV, just know I won’t discuss Off-White in this particular section. I personally believe Abloh did a phenomenal job with birthing Off-White to the world of luxury and high-end fashion. His ability to play with everyday shapes — exhibited by his education in architecture — and have us interact with them through the brand’s utility belts, brightly colored tags and traffic-sign-like designs is a buttery blend of our reality and the fashion world. His strategic collaborations with brands such as Nike in obvious Off-White manners only aided with the brand’s success.
He was a design genius, and Off-White was a breath of fresh air, molding together street style and luxury, perfectly complimenting this current generation and our wide arrange of styles and meshing personalities. 
Now back to LV. Many claimed that Abloh was unoriginal with his collections as the LV men’s artistic director. However, in interviews he outright states that he draws inspirations from architecture and past designs from LV and other designers. While some of these “homages” seem a little too copy-and-paste, such as his homage to Walter Van Beirendock’s 2016 fall collection with Abloh’s 2021 spring collection, at least he doesn’t outright claim that he is 100% original like some other brands who had been caught red-handed for stealing designs (*ahem Danielle Bernstein and Balenciaga*).
And these claims are not just hater theories or conspiracies: Diet Prada on Instagram has called out Abloh on his creations that hit a little too close to home for some other brands, like a chair at IKEA and the brand Gramm. Even fashion legend and current creative director of Prada Raf Simons answered in a GQ interview that brands that inspire him are “not Off-White” and that he felt that Abloh and Off-White’s cult following was comprised of “people who [brought] something that [he] think[s] has not been seen, that is original.” 
Still, despite this, it is silly to say that Abloh has not played a significant role in the fashion industry and representation. He was the first Black man to ever take on leadership in LV company history and further proved his capability by branching into the world of furniture and art. He also actively supported Black communities with Off-White, launching his “I Support Young Black Businesses” project that raised funds every quarter for designers and groups selected by Abloh himself. 
Not only did his great success prove formal training is not a requirement to work in the world of luxury and high-end streetwear design, but as a person of color, the reign of predominantly white and European power was actively challenged.
For those who haven’t watched Abloh’s final Louis Vuitton’s show, titled “Virgil was here,” I recommend watching the show. The collection, while full of bright spring colors, was deeply emotional as each creation planted his creativity, friendship and love in the audience for one final time. His reign has inspired this generation and will continue to inspire past his roam on Earth. He has opened many doors for a lot of people, and we will never forget his efforts in the industry and in everyday life.
Rest in peace, Virgil. Thank you for everything you’ve done.

In 2013, sixth grader Alix Page nervously stood to the side of her middle school stage, anxiously awaiting her big talent show debut. After 10 years of humming around the house and a childhood filled with “The Cure” and “Depeche Mode” on repeat, she had music coursing through her veins.
Page, now a sophomore majoring in popular music, has watched her stage fright quickly dissipate as she plays originals for a myriad of audiences in venues across the country. Page crafts music for the melodramatic masses and gets the recognition she deserves. 
Page has already garnered more than 18,000 Spotify monthly listeners. She has worked tirelessly to create a tracklist that oozes with palpable emotion and unforgettably sweet and airy vocals. If you are in the midst of a quest for a new anthem that perfectly encapsulates the feeling of heartbreak, she’s your girl.
Although Page has fashioned a raw discography that attracts listeners across the globe, music has not always been at the forefront of her life. 
“I didn’t grow up with a musical family at all,” Page said. “My immediate family just watched ‘American Idol’ once in a while and listened to the radio, basically.” 
Although, Page may not have been raised to conform to a musical standard, her passion for music is intrinsic and personal. After a few talent shows and a short theater stint, Page and her family recognized the bounds of her talent, and she attended an arts high school.
Page’s natural inclination toward music and sonic individuality is even more evident in her songwriting process. Most of her writing derives from instances of raw emotion that overflow from her brain into a verse or chorus. Page believes this spontaneous and impassioned method of songwriting served her well on her recent collection of releases.
For instance, her most popular song, “Stripes,” is poignant. She fosters relatability among listeners who struggle with heartbreak in her lyrics: “I still have the T-shirt I bought you / Never found the right time to give it away.” 
“I started listening to ‘Stripes,’ and, then, a few seconds later, my eyes were pouring water,” said Cole Silberman, Alix’s manager. “When she creates something, she is really writing from an authentic story that she’s lived through.” 
Silberman said he was distinctly moved by Page’s lyricism. He reached out to her shortly after this cathartic listening experience, and they eventually decided to work together. Silberman noted that Page’s music is so special and unique because of its gritty honesty. From the start, he felt a connection to her as an artist and person because of her ability to transform candid sentiments into melodies.
Page puts a copious amount of effort into echoing this sensation within her songs. She is supported by a team that wholeheartedly backs her projects and aligns with her values. Her drummer, Caleb Tischbern, a junior majoring in popular music, finds himself consistently blown away by the songs that Page presents them. He is eager to continue their collaboration along her journey and remarked that he foresees a very bright future for her career.
Page has curated a distinctive career thus far but anticipates far more excitement and new opportunities in the near future, she said. In November, she released a new single entitled, “Radiohead,” and has her first ever EP prepared for release soon. Additionally, Page will join Claud and Gracie Abrams as an opener on their respective tours in the beginning of 2022. 
Page believes her work is so memorable because of the soul-stirring reactions that it engenders in listeners. She has studied the way that her preferred artists craft their preeminent tracks and synthesized these techniques into her own art.
“My favorite songs are my favorite songs because I relate to them,” Page said. “I’m always like, ‘Oh, God, that is exactly how I was feeling, and I feel like that is always just the goal: relating to people and just making something that sits well in their ears.”

Since the age of 16, Sophie Beem has performed on stage, gone on tours and released music through Parkwood Entertainment after being signed by Beyoncé to a three-year artist development deal. Now, a junior at the USC Thornton School of Music, Beem is hoping to “change her sound” and learn from her peers as she redefines herself in the world of music.
Beem remembers being a part of the music world since she was a child. Growing up, she would listen to the radio and sing at the top of her lungs, and, when she was eight years old, she started taking voice lessons to improve her breathing and singing skills. It was at this time that Beem also began to learn songwriting. 
“For me, songwriting has always been a form of therapy. I feel like sometimes, as songwriters, you might be bad at just talking about your feelings, but you can actually write a song and convey your message through that song,” Beem said. “Which I think is really special, and it’s really nice that other people can relate to it.”
Curious about expanding her audience beyond friends and family, Beem spent her early teenage years searching New York City for opportunities for young people to perform. From open mic nights to small venues, she performed at any opportunity she found.
At the age of 13, Beem began co-writing songs to produce. She would go to studios and work with other artists and producers to create her songs. Although she said she enjoys writing her own music, the collaborative process created a safe space where she tried new lyrical and creative ideas without having to second guess herself. 
Beem’s deal with Parkwood Entertainment lasted three years and allowed her to dive deep into the music industry at a young age despite minimal previous experience. It was during those three years that she released her first EP, “Sophie Beem,” which consisted of five singles: “Girls Will Be Girls,” “I Got It,” “Skyline,” “Nail Polish” and “Sleepless / City Kid.” According to Beem, a lot of the songs originated from her experiences growing up quickly in a city that left little time for typical childhood experiences.
“It was a really incredible opportunity that I got when I was 15 years old, where I knew nothing about the music industry and making it in the industry,” Beem said. “I stopped going to regular high school, and I was just working full time.”
“Girls Will Be Girls” and “I Got It,” from her album received more than two million streams. She also performed on tour in 2016 with Charlie Puth on the Nine Track Mind Tour and with Beyoncé on the Formation World Tour. Since the release of her self-titled EP, Beem released three more singles.
Immersed in the music industry at a young age, Beem said she wanted to experience school and get a college education like the rest of her peers. Beem decided to work without an agency and develop her music skills and sound at Thornton. 
Eric Bender, Beem’s manager, helps her make music career decisions and the direction she hopes to take with branding and her voice. Bender saw value in her decision to escape the industry and grow in her life experiences.
“Her attending school, especially at USC, is great for her because it’s going to bring her a lot of new experiences and relationships and also growth, not only as a student and an individual, but as an artist,” Bender said.
While at USC, Beem said she wants to collaborate with as many other students as possible of all different genres and learn about the inner workings of the music industry that she never learned before.
John Turpin, a sophomore majoring in music industry, is a part of the A&R team at 840 West, a student-run record label working with Beem to help grow her connections and promote her career. 
“It’s just helping her find people to work with to create the sound for the music she wants,” Turpin said. “We like to have our hands on everything, from marketing to imaging, but for the most part, I’m helping her get connected to other people within USC’s music industry program.”
At Thornton, Beem can work with an assortment of young voices who are passionate about all aspects of the community and different genres of music. 
“​​I am really looking forward to collaborating with as many people as possible, who love music and who love to create music … [from] EDM to pop music,” Beem said.
From attending other people’s shows to working with budding artists, “it’s a super collaborative and not a very competitive space,” Turpin said. “Everyone wants everyone else to succeed.”
“I wanted to go to USC to have a community of people my own age and really be able to go through trial and error, learning and growing,” Beem said. “I feel like at a young age, I had to be really perfect because I was in this professional industry setting … but I knew I wanted to be able to be a kid and fall in love with music again.”

Wynton Jones, Dara Adedara and Kennedy Hill, founders of the student production company Fifth Floor Studios, are that rare combination of friends who can also work as a well-ordered unit. Sitting on the roof of the old Annenberg building, they banter for a while before attentively listening to each other describe their experience as young show creators, praising one another along the way.
Their harmony seems attached to the comfort they’ve been forced to foster between each other. The three juniors met on Flour Tower’s Somerville (now located in Pardee Tower), USC’s special-interest floor geared toward Black students, in 2019, living in close quarters before being sent home. Living with a mélange of Black students from various places and with different backgrounds created a freshman year floor where something was always going on.
“A lot of different things happened at Somerville,” said Jones, a junior majoring in theatre with an acting emphasis. “There were a lot of different conversations and just a lot of different entities and personalities.” 
They spent much of their time reminiscing on pre-coronavirus Somerville, describing the affinity floor as chaotically amusing. But Jones’ description of life in quarantine after leaving Somerville is very much the opposite.
“We really loved living there,” Jones added. “[But] there was a lot of ups-and-downs [when] the year of COVID that came and hit, and we were stuck to our homes and stuck to a very restricted environment.”
Instead of languishing in quarantine, the trio recognized their experience’s narrative potential, deciding to share them with their new web series, “A Black College Show,” and creating a production company to support the show and any other future projects they’d come up with. They initially intended for the show to mimic the spectrum of characters and discourse that occurred on Somerville. Eventually, though, they realized that an episodic series would require them to take on much more cinematic license, not just for the story’s sake, but for the well-being of the real people who lived on the floor. 
“It’s kind of invasive to people who live there and we’re not going, ‘Yo, is it okay if I use what happened to you?’” said Hill, a junior majoring in acting. “But more [so] just paying homage to what we experienced.”
It’s safe to say that the show, which debuted on the Fifth Floor Studios website and YouTube channel on Nov. 24, is much more than a mimicry.
Hill, who was responsible for writing the show’s script, crafted cohesive fictional portraits from seemingly sporadic sources with a platform she treasures just as much as a millennial — Pinterest. She created a mood board for each and every character, pulling an archetype out of every one of them.
“​​I started making Pinterest boards — mood boards — for every single character and really zoning down on who they were as a person,” Hill said. “Then kind of putting what people see in them as their stereotype like ‘Oh, they’re just a suburban Black girl’ or the ‘white-washed Black girl that never had no Black friends’ or the ‘artsy girl that listens to Frank Ocean and was like super shy.’”
Despite her vivid characterization, Hill had little to no experience writing a series before embarking on “A Black College Show.” It was her acting background that allowed her to make the characters’ voices more authentic, she said.
“Being an actor and reading plays, you have all these like different voices in your head,” Hill said.
Hill’s co-collaborators have equally rich ties to acting. Jones and Adedara, a junior majoring in theatre with an acting emphasis, faced no shortage of difficulties serving as the show’s director and producer, respectively. Acting in the show while handling these roles was the greatest source of dilemma for them, as expected by the trio who are also fans of Issa Rae, the writer and actress known for her balancing of acting, writing and producing her HBO series, “Insecure.” 
By the end of the 2020-21 school year, Hill finished the show’s script. She and Adedara arrived in Los Angeles shortly after. Their living arrangement was much different from their freshman year in Fluor Tower though; they spent their time in L.A. sleeping in Jones’ room in Icon Plaza where most of the series was filmed. 
Adedara’s job as producer was especially grueling in many ways. She describes late nights fixing call sheets, endless time stressing over how they’d feed their cast and maintain coronavirus regulations and recouping film locations. She ironically completed all this while portraying the character of Ayo who’s described as an always on-point, bubbly and high-maintenance “Naija baddie” by the show.
Similar to Rae, Adedara found that simultaneously starring in and producing a show is a task she never wants to dive into again. Still, she says the challenge was worth it.
“I would love to just produce a project or just act on a project, but I think taking both on at the same time was a little difficult,” Adedara said. “But I like doing things above what I think I can do.”
Rae’s impact was a common thread throughout the conversation. The trio unanimously agree on her inspirational power, and her imprint makes sense — just like Rae, Jones, Adedara and Hill are making it a priority to showcase Black joy with “Fifth Floor Studios.” It’s also not lost on them that Rae produced her own show in college — they’re proudly following in her footsteps.
“I think that that’s our main goal as a company — is to not tell stories surrounding Black trauma,” Jones said. “I think we’ve all had enough trauma stories, just Black trauma, we want to see more joyful experiences. And so that’s kind of where the production company came about from us.”
After Hill crafted the script, the heavy-lifting turned to finding actors to bring “A Black College Show’s” characters to life. Naturally, the artists were surrounded by a plethora of other Black creatives and already had people in mind who aligned with the characters tacked onto Hill’s mood boards. For the majority of the casting, though, they sent out a traditional call-sheet and interviewed actors. 
“Somebody sent [the casting call] to PettySC, the big Black group chat, so we got a lot of response from that,” Jones said. “It was very communal.”
Although they were limited to the pool of willing Black USC community members to act in their work and to extras who were near campus during Summer 2021, Adedara, Jones and Hill were determined to represent a real and underrepresented phenotype of Blackness. 
“Even looking in television, the only time I would see someone who looks like me — darker skin, plus size as well … they would be in very stereotypical roles [or] sassier [or] they would have no storyline,” Adedara said.
The trio pointed out that the implicit biases of many School of Dramatic Arts professors often deny students of color the opportunity to take on principal roles. Their frustrations with casting in their own academic program made them even more concerned about providing a space for dark-skinned actors to be showcased as more Black students enter USC.
“Many more Black people have been getting in as of late, and I’ve been hearing so many more instances of racist things happening to them,” Hill said. “They don’t have an outlet or people to talk to and  it’s so sad.”
Although the weight of pioneering roles for incoming students is difficult to manage, Adedara, Hill and Jones believe the main people who helped them carry out their mission was their cast. The three creators emphasized how grateful they were to their actors for bringing their best work to set, even though much of their opportunities to rehearse were on Zoom. 
“Thank you to all the actors. They really pulled through,” Jones said. “If we had people who were even slightly incompetent, I don’t think that we would have made it.”
For Jones, directing was exhausting due to both the frequent 12-hour workdays and their limited experience with the practice. They say it felt as though the entire project rested in their hands at times.
“The whole thing about being a director is that you have to be there for every single scene. So there’ll be times when [Hill] and [Adedara] can go sit and not be doing anything at the moment, but I will always have to be there when the camera’s rolling. That was difficult,” Jones said. “Because it was my first time there was a lot of experience that I did not have. It was simple things like [understanding], ‘Oh, this looks weird or you can’t do that.’ All of those little roadblocks.”
Seeing other people invest in Fifth Floor Studios mitigated some of the learning curves and frustrations that came with it. Adedara described moments of relief such as when students living in Icon offered their own home after their initial filming location fell through or when her mother came over to cook for the cast. 
Jones also thanked Hill and Adedara for their assistance on set. While Hill’s job ended at writing, she spent her time on set launching the show’s marketing. Before filming had even wrapped for “A Black College Show,” the group uploaded their first TikTok introducing the show’s concept. A TikTok they posted just six days ago had racked up 424k views and 115k likes at time of publication. A quick look revealed a comment section filled with praise and declarations of show loyalty. The account, @fifthfloorstudios, has 15.1k followers.
Jones described seeing young Black creatives and consumers across the United States, some they personally admired from afar, engage with their videos as a “surreal” experience. For the trio, the outpouring of support they’ve received is affirmation that the risks they’re taking are very worthwhile. As young Black artists, they can’t help but feel, not just pressure to succeed, but an obligation to be great.
“​​My parents are very traditional. They’re Nigerian, and they’re very hands-on with me,” Adedara said. “Trying to convince them to let me major in theatre was really hard, but acting is something that I just love to do.”
For Jones, “A Black College Show” is an answer to a deeply personal question. A lack of opportunity on this campus almost taunts them, and Jones wants to prove to themself that if people won’t give them opportunities, they won’t simply disappear. 
“Instead of waiting around for someone else, we took the initiative to be like, ‘We’re gonna do it for ourselves.’ It’s been a really good decision that we all made,” Jones said. “From that, we gave ourselves our own experience. We give ourselves connections with others through Fifth Floor [Studios]. In the future, we can continue to use it as our playground.”
While these students acknowledge they shouldn’t be forced to make their own opportunities at a school with so many resources, they’ve found a bright side — creating their own work has allowed them to delve into roles they wouldn’t have typically been able to. Three students who could easily be boxed into the role of actors gave themselves ownership over their creative profile. It’s a message that they want to pass on to Black people, no matter the field they’re in — that they can dominate any industry they pursue on their own terms.
Fifth Floor Studios, at its root, isn’t about Adedara, Jones and Hill. It’s about and for supporting Black excellence, or at the very least, Black opportunity. It’s a mission that the creators hope to immortalize and provide access to for generations of Black USC students to come.
“I think dominating every field that we are in, I would just love for the message of that to just transcend over creating a television miniseries or creating a production company or just acting,” Adedara said. “I think that it can transcend into any facet that we put our minds to.”

This week has been one of the most eventful ones in recent USC football history, with former Oklahoma Head Coach Lincoln Riley joining USC and planning to return the football program back to its former glory. Recruiting at a high level again is crucial to accomplish this monumental feat. 
These are some of the most important players that have already switched to USC and others that could potentially suit up in cardinal and gold in the upcoming years. 
Malachi Nelson, Quarterback, Class of 2023
One of the biggest names in the recruiting world for this 2023 class is Los Alamitos quarterback Malachi Nelson. Nelson is a Southern California native, and Riley was eventually able to convince the highly-pursued quarterback to move to Norman and play for Oklahoma. Now, with Riley at USC, Nelson will be staying close to home as he announced on social media Tuesday. The five-star recruit is ranked No. 2 in his class, according to 247Sports, right behind quarterback Archie Manning. 
Nelson led Los Alamitos to a 9-2 record this season, throwing for 39 touchdowns with 9 interceptions. Nelson’s mobility is praised by scouts, and his lean frame aids his agility when running with the ball.
Raleek Brown, Running Back, Class of 2022
Raleek Brown is another name to watch, as he decommitted from Oklahoma Wednesday night. A member of the powerhouse Mater Dei program in Santa Ana, Brown could be an important recruit for the Trojans as Riley revitalizes the program next season. A few hours after his introductory press conference Monday, Riley conducted an in-house visit with Brown. Another five-star recruit, Brown is rated as the second-highest running back in his class, according to 247Sports. 
With two running backs, senior Keaontay Ingram and redshirt senior Vavae Malepeai, having prominent roles in the team this season, the Trojans will likely have an opening at the running back position that Brown would be able to fill.
Domani Jackson, Cornerback, Class of 2022
One of USC’s biggest struggles this season has been the secondary play, and bringing in Jackson would be a huge step in the right direction. Unlike the last two mentioned recruits, Jackson has already been heavily recruited by USC — he initially committed to the school Jan. 23 but decommitted Nov. 14. Since then, Jackson has narrowed down his search to USC, Michigan and Alabama. The No. 4 recruit in the nation in his class, according to 247Sports, Jackson would be a huge get for a Trojans secondary that needs more talent to improve next season. 
Makai Lemon, Athlete, Class of 2023
Makai Lemon can bring a new dimension to the USC squad if he decides to play for the Trojans. Lemon, a teammate to Nelson at Los Alamitos, also originally committed to Oklahoma but de-committed after Riley’s departure. As of now, 247Sports predicts he will most likely come to USC, although he hasn’t officially stated an interest yet. Lemon can play on both the offensive and defensive sides, with the ability to become a wide receiver or cornerback depending on a team’s needs. 
Lemon and Nelson already have built up significant chemistry, and a commitment to USC would pave the way for a dangerous offensive combination, should Lemon become a wide receiver, in three to four years time.

I know, I know, Lincoln Riley is coming to USC, Brian Kelly is going to LSU, Michigan beat Ohio State for the first time in forever and it feels like everything that happened in America’s biggest sport happened in the college landscape. But the NFL marched on for another week as well and delivered some stellar quarterback play along with some familial drama.
Loser: Manning Cast Curse 
Eli and Peyton Manning have new jobs. Instead of chucking footballs to wide receivers, they now commentate on Monday Night Football action on select nights on the “Manning Cast.” The Mannings also interview guests throughout the show, and that’s where things get interesting; every active player who has appeared on the show has lost the following week. It would be strange for any set of six players to go 0-6. The six players who’ve fallen victim to the curse are, with one injury-related exception, very good players on very good teams: Travis Kelce, Russell Wilson, Rob Gronkowski, Matthew Stafford, Josh Allen, and Tom Brady. The five teams represented by those players are a combined 32-23 for a 58 percent winning percentage, and that’s with the Seahawks 3-8 record included. And yet, the curse still wrecks havoc.
I don’t believe in curses. The purported Madden Curse has been debunked plenty of times. The Mannings know football better than anybody else. There’s got to be a scientific explanation for their effect on talented football players, something about the importance of Monday night that only the Mannings know. Less explicable, though, is the effect this column has on players and teams.
I wrote that Daniel Jones progressed as a good passer. Since then? He’s had a couple injuries and a lot of very bad play. I talked about Ja’Marr Chase, too. His historic production evaporated the next week and hasn’t returned; he only managed 39 yards this week. I predicted that the Raiders would benefit from their signature organizational dysfunction and, uh, yeah, that has not exactly happened. I can assure you I do not possess any unique football knowledge like the Mannings. So, maybe curses are real?
Winner: Mac Jones
One player truly defies the curse of this column. In week 4, I praised Jones’ poise and play relative to other rookie quarterbacks. All Jones has done since is prove that time is a flat circle and Pats coach/sith-lord Bill Belichick will rule the NFL forever. Jones’ Patriots are on a six-game winning streak, and it’s in part because of their rookie quarterback, not in spite of him.
Earlier in the year, the big criticism levied at Jones was that, although he completed passes, he was afraid to stretch the field and threaten defenses with a deep passing game. There’s a grain of truth to it; so far, Jones has 5.4 air yards per completed throw this year, which ranks 27th in the NFL. However, his mark betters Aaron Rodgers’ — who’s a pretty dang good quarterback himself — and is less indicative of Jones’ faults than his willingness to take advantage of short throws to beat defenses. Jones is improving as time passes, too. He’s averaged at least 8.0 yards per attempt in his last three games, demonstrating the increased depth of his passing. 
Jones currently has 2,850 passing yards, good for 10th in the NFL, and a 70.3 percent completion rate. Moreover, he has a 2-1 touchdown to interception ratio with 16 touchdowns against just 8 interceptions. He’s taking care of the football and putting his team in position to win. And boy, are they winning. The Pats now have the best point differential in the NFL and stand at 8-4 after figuring things out following a 2-4 start. Luckily for Patriots fans, the Mannings won’t be able to stop Jones — he’ll be busy next Monday. The Patriots are slated to play the Bills in a match between two title contenders. And if the Mannings can’t derail Jones and the Patriots, I don’t think this column can either. I’m sorry, NFL fans. Belichick is back, again. Maybe he really is immortal. 
Loser: Helicopter Fathers
The Browns have daddy issues. A few weeks ago, the father of then-Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr. posted an Instagram video criticizing quarterback Baker Mayfield. The ten-minute video showed plays where Mayfield threw to a receiver besides Beckham Jr. Beckham Sr. then addressed a comment that claimed Mayfield was “either hating on Odell or he just doesn’t want him shining” with three green checkmarks. The Browns ended up releasing Beckham Jr., who is now with the Rams, and trying to put paternal strife in the past.
After the Browns’ horrible 16-10 loss to the Ravens in a game where the Ravens’ Lamar Jackson became the first quarterback since 2013 to throw four interceptions and still win the game, Browns star running back Kareem Hunt’s father took to Facebook to offer his own thoughts on Mayfield: “We see he’s limping he’s scared to throw the ball … go Browns hopefully.” Yikes. The Browns are in bad shape on the field — at 6-6, their playoff hopes are slipping away — and the internal issues among members of the team and their families probably won’t help. Hopefully the Browns can get their season in order before Father’s Day.

Every time Gabriela Fresquez checked the news — particularly during the 2016 election — she saw media outlets project inaccurate stereotypes and representations of the Latinx community. Fresquez, a USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumna, felt that Latinx communities were not covered comprehensively and only mentioned when it came to topics such as immigration and deportation.
Hoping to inspire change, Fresquez joined “Radar 2021” — Telemundo’s first English language news show, as a producer, lead writer and host.
The show runs on YouTube and aims to provide a more accurate and widespread perspective of Latinx communities in the media.
“During that time, there was just a lot of very negative rhetoric around Latino communities, primarily having to do with immigration and the border policies,” Fresquez said. “Generally, when those communities would be brought up, they would be brought in a very derogatory way — trying to paint the entire Latino community in a way that was very marginalized and stigmatized.” 
The Latinx community has faced discrimination for decades, Fresquez said. Seeing the impact of discriminatory treatment in 2016, Fresquez sought to create change in the world of Latinx media coverage. The news industry provided a new lens for Fresquez because she realized she could be the one framing stories. Inspired by this, Fresquez created her own show, “LatinXpert,” before joining “Radar 2021” to cover the Latinx community in a more comprehensive way than what was previously done.
“Radar 2021” runs weekly, tackling an assortment of current issues and breaking them down across a variety of perspectives throughout the Latinx community. Previous topics included art, schooling, business, sex, vaccinations and mental health.
“We’ve done shows having to do with machismo and the Latinx community. We’ve covered mental health … We did an episode on pay equity and closing the gender wage gap for women,” Fresquez said. “And, while all of these issues are typically very universal, we always are looking at it through the lens of the Latinx community.”
Grace Gonzalez became part of the “Radar 2021” team when Telemundo won a Google News Initiative Grant to create English language content for the news department on YouTube. Initially tasked by the network to create the show, Gonzalez now works as the executive producer and one of the creative developers of “Radar 2021.”
“The idea behind ‘Radar,’ when I came up with it, alongside with our senior producer, was to really try to amplify diversity and to try to have more of the voices and faces of Latinx communities across the board represented,” Gonzalez said.
The team holds brainstorming sessions to determine the show’s segments; these individual sections tend to run in a chunk of eight or nine episodes that fall under a main broad topic, which can include any issue relevant to Latinx culture. 
After the show runs through the eight or nine planned episodes, the team takes four to six weeks off to select a new wide topic and then holds pitch meetings for specific ideas to use in episodes.
“Radar 2021” looks to not only educate the public on the Latinx community but also create a space for people to see themselves represented in more ways than the narrow focus of current Latinx media coverage, Fresquez said.
“There’s so many subjects and topics that are so important to the community and that we need to talk about, and there’s a lot of topics that are very tough,” Gonzalez said. “If we’re able to create that space for people to feel that the conversation has started and that they have a place to express themselves and kind of hear everybody’s point of view and versions of their story, that’s a great place to be.”
Daniel Alvarenga, a reporter and producer for “Radar 2021,” joined the Radar team in Oct. 2020. Alvarenga finds the show important, he said, particularly because it battles the stereotypical “monolith” representation that the Latinx community often faces.
“It’s a diverse group of people, of different races and of different nationalities. There’s, like, 20 [represented] countries in this group … and I think with ‘Radar’ we’re able to get a little bit more granular and a little bit more in the weeds with identity,” Alvarenga said. “[The show can] talk about not just the things that make Latinos unique, but also the things that make Latinos unique within themselves.”
However, creating a community for younger Latinx people to speak for themselves and talk about topics such as gender, the LGBTQ+ community and other nuances like racism and colorism that were once taboo in the community makes “Radar 2021” most unique for Alvarenga. 
Creating “Radar 2021” allows Fresquez to make a difference in media representation, learn about her roots and share it with others.
“Me stepping in and deciding to create my own content was a way to give my community a voice and take up space in a medium that does not generally represent us or only represented in a very specific way,” Fresquez said.

Dressed in red jumpsuits and mesh masks resembling the costumes in Netflix’s series “Squid Game,” promoters handed out brown business cards. But instead of a mysterious number to join a deadly game, the card led recipients to a QR code linked website promoting “USC Date Game,” an event that introduced USC students with each other for either a friendship or romantic connection, while also allowing them a chance to compete for prize money. 
On Nov. 3, the event, hosted through dating app Matter’s “Happy Hour,” invited college students from across the state, including the UCLA and UCI campuses. During the hour-long event, students went on three-minute audio blind dates only open to other students at their university. The players with the highest number of matches after the hour received a monetary reward of up to $5,000, with an equal amount of money donated to USC Colleges Against Cancer.
Created by alumnus Monji Batmunkh, Matter launched after Batmunkh saw a need for connection during the beginning of the coronavirus lockdowns.
“We realized that we were inadvertently solving an unmet need, which is to connect people through conversations,” Batmunkh said. “And [the need to connect people] was very clear feedback from our users. And a lot of them had an intention to meet someone and have it potentially turn into a date. So after realizing that it was right during the pandemic that we couldn’t bring people in real life, we decided to pivot into [online] dating.” 
Matter was not originally intended as a dating app but rather a “clubhouse” focused on networking and building friendships based on their shared interests. However, Batmunkh decided to pivot the app into dating after he discovered the effectiveness of the app’s audio-first nature in connecting users. 
According to its website, Matter is a “an audio-first dating app that helps people make meaningful connections through audio conversations,” Matter bypasses swiping and texting and allows users to immediately talk after “liking” each other on the app by recording 10-second audio introductions. As each audio introduction plays, the user’s profile picture gradually unblurs. Following the reveal, users have the option to send a like or not.
“When we look at other dating apps, we realized that it’s a very lonely experience,” Batmunkh said. “You’re just swiping by yourself, and you’re just waiting, and although [swiping] is simple, hundreds of [texts] back and forth that often leads nowhere can get very exhausting and frustrating.” 
Batmunkh also said he was inspired to add a charity aspect to the game given Matter’s ongoing support of UCLA’s Relay for Life.   
“We tested the idea [of giving] half of the prize to a charity, and we also wanted to tone down the ‘Squid Game’ [aspect] as it’s a very violent movie, right? And it [has] people dying and so we’re like, ‘Okay, what if we make it so you play a date game to not only just win cash, but also to save lives?’” Batmunkh said. 
The last USC Date Game had five winners, all of whom received $425 in prize money. Additionally, Matter donated an equivalent amount of prize money to USC Colleges Against Cancer.
Briana Connors, one of the winners, enjoyed the aspect of anonymity during the blind date. 
“You form an image after those three minutes talking to the person and then you see the picture [of them],” said Connors, a freshman majoring in sociology. “You’re thinking to yourself, ‘That is not the person I was talking to.’” 
Chloe Tran, another winner, said it was nice getting to know people she “normally wouldn’t .” 
“I liked that it was a blind phone call conversation because it makes you open up to the person rather than [thinking] ‘Is this person attractive’ or ‘I have to look presentable right now,’” said Tran, a sophomore majoring in sociology. “I like that aspect of it because you got to know a person a little bit more.”

Nearly 40 students and activists gathered outside Tommy Trojan Wednesday for a “Care Not Cops Rally” to protest the Department of Public Safety’s treatment of Kayla Love and her fiancé, Khari Jones Jr., marching to USC Village holding signs reading “Abolish DPS” and “Divest and Reinvest.” Protesters criticized DPS’ conduct with Love and spoke about long standing concerns regarding racism students experience at the hands of DPS.
On June 27, the day Love gave birth to her daughter, 10 Los Angeles Police Department and DPS officers and a social worker showed up at her on-campus family housing unit, claiming to be conducting a wellness check. 
Tensions rose when the wellness check, which Love said officers did not provide a reason for, escalated as officers drew weapons in the couples’ apartment, according to them. Love, a graduate student studying chemistry, and Jones have since spoken out about the incident and the three subsequent officer visits, calling the conduction of the wellness checks unethical and a breach of privacy. 
Protestors stood in a circle next to the water fountain at USC Village and shared experiences of instances with DPS that have been “potentially harmful to their lives,” as well as their feelings about Love’s incident. 
Effa Fouda, a freshman majoring in business administration, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that hearing about the incident with Love was “one of the first introductions to the life of a person of color at USC” when he first joined the Black Students Assembly.
“It was really heartbreaking and kind of overwhelming to hear about the potential of living at a campus where the subjugation of Black people is a daily occurrence and can happen at any moment in time,” Fouda said. 
Fouda said he and his friends have already had negative experiences with DPS, and he hopes USC reallocates money from DPS into programs that support “minority groups on campus,” ultimately advancing toward the organization’s abolishment.
One of the attendees, Laila Hassell, said she came to show support for Love and to demonstrate the growing frustration with the University’s lack of response to the incident, even five months later.
“It’s just been stressful and honestly, disheartening, just the fact that nothing has happened yet,” said Hassell, a junior majoring in design. “USC hasn’t said anything. [The couple hasn’t] been compensated in any type of way. They haven’t received justice for anything yet.”
During the protest, Love spoke about a petition launched by the couple in October. The petition, which has 1,444 signatures at the time of publication, demands the termination of all parties involved in the check, the provision of reasonable supportive measures such as compensation and the removal of academic holds Love continues to face after the incident. 
Chris Martin, an attorney at law, said he came out to show his “complete support” for Love and Jones and his “complete opposition” to what the couple experienced. Martin said he was very proud of the students taking up Love and Jones’ fight and said he’d like to see more compassion from the administration for the couple and other students who have had similar experiences with DPS.
“What we need, ultimately, is care and not cops,” said Martin, who serves as the director of the legal team for Black Lives Matter Los Angeles. “[University leadership officials] need to not treat their students like they’re suspects, but treat them like they are students, like they are human beings and like, ultimately, their lives matter.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that it is aware of the issues Love raised. While the University said it was unable to share details about Love’s situation because of student privacy laws, it is “deeply concerned when any student experiences any kind of trauma.”
Adrian Perez, who spoke at the protest, also expressed discontent with the University’s response to Love and Jones’ interactions with DPS, and with USC’s treatment of Black and brown students. 
“They only care about [Black and brown students] when we’re there to entertain them, or when we’re on their football team, when we’re in their face, when we’re doing good in their classes,” said Perez, a freshman majoring in public policy. “It’s time that we really apply pressure on them.”
Perez said low-income students, as well as Black and brown students, aren’t a priority on campus and that there needs to be greater action from USC to target racial inequality.
“I think that it’s very easy for us to become comfortable with this pain,” Perez said. “I think it’s very easy for us to feel like we’re powerless in the struggle. But I think that we just have to continue fighting.”

On Nov. 19, the Daily Trojan spoke with President Carol Folt about the University’s status, including previous scandals such as former Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito’s “drug-fueled misconduct,” the seven reports of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house and other locations on and off the Row, the relationship between the administration and faculty and potential changes to the Board of Trustees. This article is part two of a two-part interview with Folt. The first part focused on questions regarding the University’s response to sexual assault reports and fraternities.
This article has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: In the faculty protests about reports of sexual assault and drugging, we’ve heard calls for the administration to release the George Tyndall reports. Following the Los Angeles Times story detailing Tyndall’s sexual abuse, Max Nikias’ administration promised they would conduct an independent investigation and release reports, but they were never released. What do you know about those reports?
Carol Folt: We know that [those reports] are owned by the Board of Trustees, and Rick Caruso has come out several times and said he misspoke. There are no reports — they didn’t take them to final reports. I have not seen reports. They did have a presentation to the Board, and they also gave that same presentation to the Faculty Senate at that time.
I would love it if there was a report and [the Board] would pledge right now to put it out there. I think we have some difficulty with that because there’s no formal investigation that came to a report. So I think that is hard. Tyndall is different — that’s under trial. So, even if there were a report — which I’m not saying there is — they couldn’t release it. It would be in the hands of the prosecutors right now. 
Because, once you start having an investigation, we can put things out there that can then be used to exonerate whoever’s being investigated. So that trial has to be complete.
DT: So we can talk about Dean Carmen Puliafito. I’m wondering if this administration, in the interest of transparency, would ever consider commissioning a report?
CF: No. I couldn’t commission a recreation of the Puliafito report. That happened how many years ago? I think we’re talking five, six, seven years ago — there’s nobody still here … which means they don’t have to speak to us. So I’m much better off trying to work with the [Board of Trustees] on that one. And realize with that one, too, everything was turned over to the police. So there’ve been no charges. No one’s been investigated. 
I did issue a report with the Faculty Senate … We’ve completely revamped how deans are replaced. So we took what looked to be clear mistakes — “Why didn’t Puliafito ever get replaced?” — and not tried to figure out exactly why it did happen but to figure out why it would never happen again.
I wish that those [reports] were out, because I think that would really help people. But I have to work where I have the capacity to make that change. 
DT: Do you think this administration has a role in remedying the harm of past administrations?
CF: Well, I think that’s all we ever do — is remedy the harms. That’s what the job was. I didn’t create it, but I need to fix this. So that’s why we’ve been trying to do all the legal things; put in all the new places; try to do everything we can for the past survivors. So, absolutely, it’s to remedy the harms, but it’s also to make sure that there aren’t future harms. 
DT: Some faculty have spoken up about what they call administrative failures in various newspapers. How do you react to that sort of public criticism? Have you made any efforts to reach out to faculty who have made these comments?
CF: I do feel that we have a responsibility to tell the truth, and I feel like we have a responsibility to correct misinformation. And we’ve tried to correct as much misinformation that’s out there. I would tell anyone to find me someone that’s given more public information about every one of the things that happened here. And so, when people say you’re not giving public information, the best I could do is just say “Well, maybe it’s too long, and you didn’t read.” I’m not sure why people aren’t looking at it, but I continue to direct them and I continue to answer. But I tried very hard not to take it personally, because I don’t think it is. 
I accept honest criticism. I really do. I have to. It would be really awful not to. But I also try to stick where I can to facts or at least give my best perspective, and hopefully that’s heard by them. 
DT: Have you had discussions with faculty who have spoken out, or just faculty in general, about all these issues?
CF: Absolutely. What do you think we do all the time? We go to the Academic Senate, I meet with everybody; we talk to the deans; we reach out to faculty. Absolutely. I don’t do the whole University myself. The [Provost Charles Zukoski] is out there; he did another webinar. We’ve talked, we’ve had webinars from 600 to 800 people that have been coming to them … With the [Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability] that we’re putting together for the IFC, they’ll reach out to everyone that’s written me a letter with demands or suggestions. And I’ve written answers to all of those to try to get those out. And [the taskforce] will bring them in to talk about their issues. So [we’re] trying not to write back to people and say, “What you said is wrong.” We’re trying to write back and say, “Thank you. These are the things as we know” and “How can you help us?”
DT: You’ve mentioned the University hosting several webinars. However, specifically with the previously set Undergraduate Student Government town hall that was cancelled and moved to a Zoom webinar format, USG leaders, some faculty members and students have criticized that format.
CF: I feel strongly about that. So, we didn’t cancel. [USG] came to us and said ‘Would you do a meeting?’ And we said ‘Yes.’ They decided a format — and, by the way, hadn’t spoken to us about that. Then, when they spoke to us and said that they’d opened it up — that they were bringing people from the press that were going to be there — our healthcare people, who are going to be there because these are sensitive topics, said that you cannot do conversations like that in big public forums — it is damaging and dangerous. And [our healthcare people] wouldn’t come. And we called them and we said ‘We can’t do it that way. It harms survivors.’ 
I don’t think you have big events with survivors and others telling their personal story open to the public or necessarily even open … These are complicated things with lots of legal but also personal anguish. So I have to go for the most anguished [people] and protect [them].
DT: There have been calls to add more academic and student voices onto the Board of Trustees. Have there been updates with that?
CF: [The Board] didn’t talk about adding new people, but they did add students and faculty into all the working committees. And they’re thinking about changing that and giving them a more formal role. So I think that’s where you’re likely to see changes.
DT: How do you evaluate the general relationship between the Board of Trustees and faculty? Faculty, interviewed by the Daily Trojan at mentioned protests and outside protests, said they believe the Board’s interests do not align with academic interests?
CF: You’ve talked to very few people. I know how big those protests are, and I know how that does not represent the whole faculty.
The board actually interacts with faculty a lot. The faculty go to a lot of things, the board go to a lot of things, they have different faculty with different relationships. The Board does not do the daily operations in the University. They aren’t supposed to. They’re supposed to be at the 30,000 foot [level], and they’re supposed to make sure that we’re following and complying and, so, that’s why they went through their own governance, because they felt they had failed [at] doing a lot of that compliance and infrastructure. So I think their concentration right now has been “How do we reestablish the fact that we have governance that will really keep the University very secure and running in a very good way?” And, also, “How do we make sure that we don’t do maybe the worst of all things, which is stop thinking about the future?”

USC is set to travel to UC Berkeley to play the Bears in the final game of the season. The Trojans are looking to avoid their first four-game losing streak since 2001, with Berkeley having won three of its last five games. After Saturday’s loss, the Trojans enter the game officially bowl ineligible for the second time in four years. As the two programs meet for the 108th time, USC leads the series with a record of 70-31-5 dating back to 1915.
Originally set to square off Nov. 13, the game was postponed following a coronavirus outbreak within Berkeley’s team. 
The Trojans head into this game fresh off hiring Lincoln Riley as the new football head coach. 
“There’s definitely high energy,” said sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. in a press conference Tuesday. “It’s a change in our future but everybody’s locked into the now. Everybody’s focused on Cal.”
Saturday’s matchup will also be emotional for some players on the team, who will play their final game for the Trojans. 
“Last game was very emotional for the seniors,” said interim Head Coach Donte Williams after Tuesday’s practice. “We’ll also have some juniors or redshirt juniors that may want to look at the NFL and give that a try, so now this is not just even about the seniors but it’s about all those guys that could be playing their last game in a USC uniform.”
USC’s last matchup against Cal occurred Nov. 16, 2019 at Berkeley, where the Trojans came out on top 41-17. Despite a losing record at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this season, USC has a .500 record in road games this season, coming up with victories over Washington State and Colorado while losing against Notre Dame and Arizona State. 
Both teams enter the game with 4-7 records with USC in fourth place in the Pac-12 South and Cal in fourth place in the Pac-12 North. USC will rely on its passing attack to get the job done on offense. The Trojans enter this game first in the Pac-12 in yards per game with 447 and also lead the conference in pass yards per game at 301.
USC will also look to gain contributions from the run game as well, with two running backs coming off season highs in rushing. Redshirt senior running back Vavae Malepeai and sophomore running back Darwin Barlow had 99 and 81 rushing yards respectively against BYU. Senior running back Keaontay Ingram, who is currently 89 yards away from a 1,000 yard season, is listed as questionable with an upper-body injury, but attended practice Tuesday.
USC’s offense will go against a Cal defense featuring players such as safeties Daniel Scott and Elijah Hicks along with outside linebackers Muelu Iosefa and Cameron Goode. The Bears’ defense is fourth in the Pac-12 in yards per game allowed and points allowed. Cal’s defense is also in the Top 25 nationally in turnover margin and interceptions. 
The Trojan defense currently ranks second to last in the conference in yards per game allowed, giving up 422 yards per game and last in scoring defense, giving up 32.5 points per game this year. They will be going against a Cal offense led by senior quarterback and four-year starter Chase Garbers. Garbers is Cal’s record holder for most quarterback rushing yards and touchdowns. 
Williams emphasized keeping his focus on the final game at hand after practice Tuesday, even in the midst of a leadership turnover within the program.
“Everything for me, it’s always been about going 1-0,” Williams said. “It’s been about the process, the journey week to week. This is just how I’m wired, I’m not a person that’s gonna worry about something tomorrow until it becomes tomorrow.”
USC will take on Cal 8:00 p.m. Dec. 4 at California Memorial Stadium.

Deciding on a meal plan can be a stressful endeavour, especially when looking at plans’ outrageously high prices. USC’s cheapest plan for freshmen is the Cardinal Plan. For $3,315, students are granted 19 swipes per week or 2.7 swipes per day. Although this system may sound great, it assumes that all students are not only eating roughly three meals a day but also choosing to eat all three meals where swipes are accepted. This means no outside restaurants and no dinners at the dorm. 
Although it may provide a sense of nutritional security, a meal plan requirement for all incoming students perpetuates the idea of USC as a money-hungry institution. At institutions like USC, swipes are nonrefundable and don’t roll over, which makes it feel like students lose money by not fully taking advantage of their meal plans. To better combat this sense of money and food waste, USC should implement its own donation cycles for weekly leftover meal swipes. 
Our community needs these leftover swipes now more than ever. A recent report conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture found that in 2020, roughly 10.5% of American households fell under the category of food-insecure at some time during the year.  In Los Angeles County, the number of households that experienced some type of food disruption — instances of food insecurity — rose to roughly 33% between the months of April and December 2020. Food shelters have also struggled to keep up with drastic rises in prices. 
The current inflation surge in the U.S. means that food prices and labor shortages are seriously harming charities. The demand for food is growing and so are the costs.
Back in 2012, USC partnered with a student organization called “Swipes for the Homeless.” From its efforts, per a 2014 document released by the University, an average of $20,000 worth of food per semester was given to unhoused individuals in L.A. County. From 2014 onward, Trojans were invited to download an app that would then prompt them to pledge a donation of their extra dining dollars at the end of the semester. Although the pledging window opened and closed two weeks before break, the actual funds were not taken out until the window for the semester closed. 
A spinoff group, “Trojans Give Back,” organizes food drives for students to donate food they purchase with leftover swipes. Its Instagram, @sctrojansgiveback, announces every week when another donation cycle is occurring — usually Fridays from 12 to 3 p.m. in front of Popovich Hall — as well as important information about food insecurity in L.A.
The issue with this organization is not at all the way in which students run or structure it. These efforts come from the students themselves and are not an initiative conducted by the University. USC has more than enough funds to set up a weekly food drive for those willing to give their unused swipes, so why is it not? It’s almost impossible to find an answer.
As shifty as many are behind the scenes, USC lacks transparency about where it allocates money leftover from dining plans. Not only is the school not funding nor supporting any efforts to give food back to the L.A. community but it buried whatever financial information may aid in understanding why the meal plans are so expensive in the first place. 
The school is undeniably lacking, and as unfortunate as it is, the meals of hundreds of people across L.A. are in the hands of the students, not the billion dollar institution. It is time for USC to step forward and prioritize its community as much as its students.

Instead of a week filled with friendly and lighthearted banter, Conquest Week revealed USC’s embarrassing, unspoken sector — the University student body’s rampant classist and ignorant views. 
On the day of USC and UCLA’s annual football game, posters containing offensive and classist rhetoric permeated USC’s campus and students’ social media platforms. Students posted derogatory statements, such as “Your dad works for my dad” and “You can’t afford us” as jabs to UCLA students for attending a public school.
This type of rhetoric not only poorly reflects on the student body and USC’s values but also fuels negative stereotypes, which stain the University’s reputation as a diverse and equitable institution. 
 However, this classism is not new. USC’s vexatious nickname, “University of Spoiled Children,” paints the stereotypical Trojan as affluent and entitled, coming from rich trust fund families who pay the University’s high tuition prices. 
Although merely caricature of the typical Trojan, these stereotypes, unfortunately, hold true during moments such as these, reflecting many students’ pompous and arrogant attitudes especially when displaying statements that belittle low-income students.
 These words may be aimed at the Bruins, but such rhetoric also harms low-income students at USC who rely on financial aid and merit scholarships to afford higher education. Approximately two-thirds of USC students receive some degree of financial aid, and more than 4,100 enrolled undergraduate students come from low-income households.
Allowing these statements to exist without backlash establishes a toxic, pervasive culture of shallow values, placing significance on socioeconomic status and discriminating based on financial footings. Students continually engaging in this unacceptable behavior perpetuate the student body’s superficial atmosphere of materialism and conceited attitudes. 
This offensive rhetoric not only harms low-income students but also paints a horrid picture of USC consisting of privileged and ignorant students. Instead of being funny or humorous, these signs depict unsophisticated and unworldly college students, unaware of their entitled attitudes and once again serving as an embarrassing representation of Trojan values and ethics. 
With students openly flaunting their elitism across various social media platforms, this portrayal of our school can also impede future students who wish to attend USC. By creating an exclusive atmosphere within a school that preaches diversity and equity externally, current students deter potential applicants from associating with such an elitist institution. Although our school has a prestigious reputation, its reputation as a controversial institution is growing. 
Additionally, this behavior highlights the University’s failures in confronting and addressing class discrimination, which reveals USC’s twisted priorities in regulating student behavior. The silence on the administration’s part — whether or not they were aware of such statements — speaks volumes about this topic and sends a message to every low-income student that the University condones elitist behaviors and attitudes. 
Students posing in front of such statements to goad UCLA lands more poorly on our own school than it does on the Bruins. Anyone who stands for this type of ignorance should be deeply ashamed, continually reflect on their privilege and question why they believe this type of behavior is acceptable or justifiable. 
Whether or not students made these statements in good taste, insulting a demographic by making socioeconomic status the butt of a joke only reveals the true losers of the perpetual rivalry. The USC community should be embarrassed by letting our ignorance spiral out of control of what should have remained a healthy, rivalrous banter. 
After a slew of recent controversies, let us not add fuel to the fire with discriminatory language but instead check our privilege and do better as students. Individuals are more than their material wealth, and such superficial attitudes have no place at a diverse and unprejudiced institution.

When I was in elementary school, I discovered the channel that changed my life. In fact, it is largely the reason I’m sitting here right now, writing about food. As I was flipping through channels one fateful afternoon after school, I stumbled upon the Food Network. While watching my first of many “Chopped” episodes, I immediately fell in love with each chef’s excitement and passion — even the ones who made the mistake of using the ice cream machine in the dessert round.
For a kid who loved food but was not allowed near the stove, I relished the opportunity to live vicariously through Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto’s elaborate competition spreads or Giada De Laurenris dinner party preparation. As a 10-year-old vegetarian, I may have never eaten a steak, but I knew exactly how to baste it in butter to optimize its texture and flavor.
 The older I got, the harder it was to ignore the way misogyny affected my favorite cooking shows. Because our patriarchal society constantly pushes the narrative that a woman’s place is in the kitchen, one would imagine that The Food Network, a channel all about kitchens around the world, would be dominated by women.
 Although women have more opportunities to pursue career interests, heteronormative relationships still place homekeeping on women. In the United States, 80% of women living with a partner state they do most of the meal preparation. 
While women have long been underrepresented or stereotyped in TV shows, cooking networks seem like the perfect place to spotlight women and challenge those stereotypes. If the burden of cooking falls on women, fame from cooking should be the same.
However, culinary media, which receives attention and monetary compensation, always excluded women. A study from the 2015 book “Taking the Heat,” showed that of all the chef profiles published between 2004 and 2009 in four major publications, only 11% focused on women and 12% featured men and women. These same abysmal statistics hold to this day. Currently, of the top 50 celebrity chefs with the highest net worth, only 10 are women.
Not only are women underrepresented in cooking media, shows marketed to women also reaffirm existing stereotypes. Women’s cooking shows generally focus on domestic cooking, from “Giada at Home” to Ina Garten’s “Barefoot Contessa.” Instead of using these shows as a platform to share women’s range of experience in the kitchen, network executives use the channel to remind women of their strictly domestic role in the kitchen.
On the flip side, men on the channel helm competition shows that focus on industry-style cooking. On “MasterChef,” “Iron Chef” and “Cupcake Wars,” popular competition shows with rotating judges and contestants, the hosts are consistently men.
Gordon Ramsey is well known for screaming at competitors and giving harsh feedback to chefs on his show, “Hell’s Kitchen.” Similarly, Robert Irvine’s “Dinner: Impossible” and “Restaurant: Impossible” are high-pressure shows in which Irvine focuses on catering and the restaurant business and treats the people he trains harshly.
The problem is much more invasive than a few cherry-picked examples. Across most major cooking networks, show concepts push the idea that women’s culinary prowess cannot extend beyond their family kitchen. 
It’s easier to spot sexism when it plays out on national television. However, the misogyny in cooking shows is a byproduct of the rampant sexism in the cooking industry. 
For example, Cat Cora, an Iron Chef, mentioned that she applied to positions at 10 Michelin three-star restaurants after graduating from culinary school. Eight of these restaurants allegedly informed her that they do not have women in their kitchens.
Sara Moulton, a former celebrity chef, talked about facing sexism and harassment in professional kitchens over the past 40 years. She encountered many chefs who claimed that women could not work in the kitchen because they were too emotional, could not handle the pressure and high temperatures and were not able to lift heavy pots. Although these arguments hold no merit, the bias against women has turned the kitchen into a boy’s club: In restaurants across the country, over 75% of chefs and head cooks are men.
Power structures only survive because they reaffirm one another — i.e. capitalism and the patriarchy. The patriarchy’s survival relies on women lacking financial and political power. By barring women from using their cooking skills professionally, the cooking industry makes it increasingly difficult for women to profit off their knowledge and earn the financial power that could challenge the existing system.
Sometimes it’s hard to believe sexism and misogyny’s prevalence in 2021. Although we have a long way to go, the status quo within the food industry is beginning to shift. Popular chefs such as Mario Batali have been called out for sexual misconduct, forcing conversations about toxic kitchen work culture. The more we stand with women who call out misogyny and uplift chefs, such as Priya Krishna and Alex Guarnaschelli, the closer we move toward a safe and fair industry.

Hand-select the most flattering pictures of yourself, create a sly but not-so-cheesy pick-up line and hope online banter materializes into romance. This is the constant routine for avid dating app users who hope to score dates with people they meet online. It seems innocuous enough, right? 
In our media-centric environment, it is hard to find a date the “old-fashioned” way; instead, most people resort to these apps. Although dating apps can successfully help people find and maintain a healthy dating roster, they are also laden with problems that call into question their safety for communicating with strangers on online platforms. 
These dating apps’ inherent dangers manifested in real time on Nov. 11 when Department of Public Safety evacuated USC’s Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, Sample Hall and Wallis Annenberg Hall because of a bomb threat. Similar threats — albeit unfounded — targeted other top universities such as Yale, Brown and Columbia. 
A young woman, operating under the pseudonym Jia, alleges that her online stalker, Ryan, is behind the bomb threats. According to Jia’s accounts, Ryan became obsessed with her after the two spoke online and maintains that he will continue making bomb threats until she agrees to date him. The flurry of threatening tweets aimed to implicate Jia by writing messages such as “@Columbia Hello My partner and I [a woman named Jia’s Twitter account] have placed 40 IED explosives on your campus inside of the butler hall, Carman hall, Lerner hall along the bookstore we have also placed motion detected ANFO bomb’s with PVC pipes to kill anyone on the college walk.” This twisted story highlights the potential risks of meeting people online. 
On dating apps, a user has virtually no substantive information about their potential date besides their pictures, pithy bio and perhaps age or educational background. However, users can easily fabricate this rudimentary information. 
Moreover, no vetting process can corroborate their character. Although encounters with people we meet online can physically harm us, we often don’t heed attention to their mental and physiological dangers. 
The ephemeral online interaction between Jia and Ryan dispels this notion that talking in an online setting, seemingly protected behind a screen, can have no harmful ramifications. Even if users never interact in real life, a simple conversation can spiral into an obsession, hence why it’s so important for people to closely guard their personal information so it cannot be weaponized against them. Users must therefore exercise caution throughout the entire dating process, beginning with the talking stage.
Although users could perceive dating apps as a game of trust, they should instead approach each online conversation in a more dubious fashion. If people use dating apps to chat with potential partners, it is critical they protect themselves as much as feasibly possible from any potential physical and mental threats. 
The simplest solution would be for men to stop abusing dating apps as a way to take advantage of young women. However, this is endemic to the DNA of dating apps, so the change may not happen overnight. 
Another easy fix to these problems would be to simply ditch dating apps and instead find other ways to date. However, in our technology-driven society, this solution doesn’t seem probable. Although a resounding rejection of dating apps may not be the answer, users can take preemptive measures to effectively protect themselves on dates. 
For example, a person can meet their date in a public place and text a trusted friend their whereabouts when they are on a date. To assess the mental stability of their potential date, users can also have a few FaceTime dates prior to actually meeting in person. Although none of these measures are foolproof, they can help mitigate potential damage or harm. 
Dating apps becoming the norm does not necessarily render them safe. Users should either rethink their usage of the apps or take safety precautions before meeting suitors in person. Although the bomb threats may seem like an anomaly, similar dangers — perhaps on a smaller scale — are certainly commonplace.
