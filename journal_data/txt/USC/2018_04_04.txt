USC Concerts Committee announced Wednesday that indie rock band Glass Animals will headline Springfest 2018 this Saturday. Rappers Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes will be the openers for the show.

Glass Animals is best known for their song “Gooey,” which has garnered more than 116 million plays on Spotify.  The group’s four members met in secondary school in Oxford, England, and formed the band in 2010 during college. They released their first album, ZABA, in 2014, and their most recent album, How to Be a Human Being, in 2016. 
“After hearing student feedback, we brought a band as headliner to make sure all USC students felt heard,” Concerts Committee co-director Tufan Nadjafi said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
2017’s Springfest resulted in a shutdown before the headlining rapper duo Rae Sremmurd performed due to overcrowding and security concerns. The University has set new safety measures in place for this year’s event.
“We have additional officers specifically assigned to Springfest who will just work the event,” Assistant DPS Chief David Carlisle said. “LAPD is assigning 10 officers to work at the event and around USC.”
Students are also now required to pre-register for the event and will not be allowed to bring outside guests.
Carlisle also said DPS will close the campus perimeter at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. to ensure they can regulate the crowd coming into the show, and that they will have twice as many officers at the event as last year, in addition to the normal number of officers patrolling campus. 
Concerts Committee also announced Tuesday that Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes would be opening Saturday’s concert. 
Playboi Carti’s two most played songs include “Magnolia” and “wokeuplikethis*.” The rapper was also featured on Lana Del Rey’s song “Summer Bummer” alongside A$AP Rocky.
“Playboi Carti came off of a strong 2017 and is set to continue his success with a new album dropping in the very near future,” Nadjafi said. 
Nineteen-year-old rapper Sheck Wes started on SoundCloud, but was recently signed in a joint record deal with Kanye West and Travis Scott’s records under the label Interscope. Wes grew up moving between Milwaukee and New York City, and describes himself as a “mudboy,” a reference to his humble start in music. MUDBOY is also the title of Wes’ upcoming musical project. 
“We strongly believe Sheck Wes, who recently signed to Travis Scott’s imprint under Interscope, has the potential to be a huge artist,” Nadjafi said. 
Springfest 2018 will take place Saturday at 5 p.m. on McCarthy Quad and is free for all USC students.

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
The new citizenship question on the 2010 Census seems innocuous. Why not find out how many citizens are in the United States?
But the Census question does not appear in a vacuum. Instead, in a politically charged environment regarding immigrants — distinctly marked by President Donald Trump’s promises to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and his pledge to ban immigration of people from Muslim-majority countries — it carries a more sinister connotation. At a time when local police departments too often turn immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it’s not difficult to see why immigrants might be scared to share data about their legal status with the government. 
And so a likely consequence is clear. Adding an unnecessary citizenship question to the census — which everyone is legally required to complete —  will discourage response rates from immigrant communities, leading to a population undercount, which has important implications for political representation and policy research. 
Immigrants and communities of color already have abysmal response rates compared to white citizens on government surveys. The 2010 Census — which did not include a question about citizenship — overcounted white Americans, while undercounting Hispanic Americans, black Americans, American Indian and Alaska Native Americans. That undercount might only become more drastic with this policy change. 
Undercounting the population could make a significant difference in the drawing of Congressional districts, shifting political power away from states with a high percentage of noncitizens — often blue states — and toward states with less noncitizens —  often red states. That electoral math, Republicans are hoping, might keep them in power when new lines are drawn in 2020. Such a strategy comes off the heels of Republican gerrymandering in 2010, in which $30 million invested in state legislature battles enabled Republican victories in states where legislatures could draw the lines for Congressional districts. As a result, Republicans secured a 234-201 majority in the House of Representatives, even though Republican candidates received 1.4 million fewer votes than Democratic candidates in 2012. Changing the census would only further such gerrymandering.
Some conservative politicians think that the population counts for Congressional districts shouldn’t include noncitizens at all. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted last week, “districts apportioned based on # of people not here legally dilutes the political representation of citizens & legal residents.”

It’s true that, when noncitizens are counted for representation, citizens have less proportional political power. But even though noncitizens — including legal permanent residents, noncitizens with other types of legal status and undocumented residents — can’t vote, they are still impacted by the policies implemented by elected officials. 
“Nonvoters have an important stake in many policy debates,” Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority in Evenwel v. Abbott, which found that states cannot be forced to draw Congressional districts based on voter-eligible populations. 
The 2016 American Community Survey estimates that 22 million people in the United States are noncitizens. Moreover, immigrant communities are often concentrated in urban areas with 1.8 million noncitizens in Los Angeles alone. Neglecting noncitizens in our population counts has the effect of ignoring whole communities. Redistricting based on voter-eligible populations would dilute the political representation of legal permanent residents and other immigrants.
Regardless of electoral math, an undercount of the national population could seriously harm the disbursement of federal funds. Researchers at George Washington Institute of Public Policy found that approximately 300 federal programs administer $800 billion to states based on Census population counts. And for each person missing in the 2010 Census, 37 states lost a median of $1,091 in the fiscal year 2015.
By increasing the likelihood of an undercount, the added question reduces the census’ reliability as a scientific data source for policymakers to consult. That could have real implications for social science and health research, which tomorrow’s policy is contingent upon. Moreover, there isn’t a pressing research need to ask about citizenship in the census; the American Community Survey already estimates citizenship data. The major difference is that population counts based on the American Community Survey don’t form the basis for drawing Congressional districts.
Adding the citizenship question might reduce response rates and skew population counts away from immigrants, which is the underlying purpose of the policy change. This insidious political maneuver could result in underrepresentation of immigrants in Congress, and failure to provide necessary resources and accurate data for policy and social science research. 
Constituents should start calling Congress: Even though the census seems complicated and inconsequential, it is anything but. And come November, let’s not forget about this.

In his farewell address, former President Barack Obama said, “It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we’ve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: Citizen.”
But the truth is, not everybody shares this “same proud title.” Exactly how many of us do? This is the question President Donald Trump and his administration want to answer in the 2020 Census.
The Trump administration decided last week to add a question regarding residents’ citizenship status in the 2020 Census. Since that decision was made public, many have responded disproportionately. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra was the first to announce that California would be suing the Trump administration for its decision. Some 11 states have since joined the suit. While there is understandable frustration among these states, they must recognize that the addition of this question is not unconstitutional simply because they disagree with it. 
First and foremost, the census asked Americans the citizenship question until 1950. A question regarding citizenship was included while the very Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution were alive. As such, there is no question of “Founders’ intent.” If the document’s authors had a constitutional issue with asking about citizenship status on the census, they would have objected to it. 
Secondly, we must look to the purpose of the census itself. The census is a constitutional requirement, as delineated by Article I of the Constitution.
There are no guidelines outlined in the Constitution for what specific questions must or should be asked on the census. The Constitution is clear that the census’ purpose is for the apportionment of representatives per state. States also use the census to draw up their Congressional districts, ensuring each district is roughly the same size and that each representative is responsible for representing an equal number of people and citizens. 
Art by Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
There is no debate as to the census’ purpose, which is to determine  how many people each Congressional representative should represent. The fundamental privilege that distinguishes  citizens from most noncitizens is the right to vote. Green card holders can also vote in local and state elections. Citizens have the opportunity to elect their representatives, and noncitizens do not. Therefore, only citizens should be considered for the apportionment of Congressional representatives. 
This opinion, however, is not universal. The Supreme Court has weighed in regarding gerrymandering, but it has never truly considered the question of whether noncitizens should be counted in the census. In fact, in the most recent apportionments case Evenwel v. Abbot in 2015, the Court specifically chose not to rule on this issue. 
This is not to say that noncitizens have no value in the census and understanding the modern U.S. Noncitizens will still be counted in the 2020 Census; they will simply be distinguished from noncitizens for apportionment purposes. 
The claim that asking citizenship status will deter undocumented immigrants from responding to the census is unfounded. The census does not ask for a social security number or even proof of citizenship. It is sent to every address and quickly counted for statistical purposes. 
It is unsurprising, then, that California — the state with the largest population as well as the most noncitizens (13 percent of Californians are noncitizens) — is the state heading the lawsuit opposing this change in the census. Regardless of whether these citizens are documented, the 2020 Census distinguishing between citizens and noncitizens would affect apportionment. 
That said, the suit being brought before federal court is a positive undertaking. It will force a ruling regarding who should be enumerated for apportionment purposes. With varying opinions across the country, Americans deserve a consensus on the census.

Starting in the fall straws will no longer be offered in USC dining halls after a student petition to remove them garnered more than 1,000 signatures in the past month. Plastic straws will still be available to students or guests who request them.
Erik Russell, the associate director of Residential Dining, created the “Zero Waste Task Force to discuss ways to expand upon sustainability in residential dining. Daily Trojan File Photo.
The petition to eliminate straws was started last month by the student club Environmental Core, more commonly known as ECore; the Environmental Student Assembly and the Undergraduate Student Government advocacy branch. 
The three groups met with representatives from Residential Dining last week to discuss the removal of plastic straws in dining halls. This marked the first meeting of the “Zero Waste Task Force,” a new group under Residential Dining which includes members from student government and organizations, Residential Dining and USC’s waste hauler Republic. 
Erik Russell, the associate director of Residential Dining, created the task force. He said the purpose of the group is to find ways to expand upon sustainability initiatives in dining. 
“This is really a chance to work collaboratively with the different stakeholders,” Russell said. “[It gets] the message to the student base that we are taking this seriously, we do see opportunities, we are doing things and we’d like to do more.”
Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, a sophomore majoring in psychology and the director of ECore, said that straws were the primary barrier to dining halls from composting more food waste.
“In conversations we had with different people in [Residential] Dining, we learned that plastic straws were one of the few things in dining that couldn’t be composted and that they were a slight hiccup in getting post-consumer composting in the dining halls,” Shaw-Wakeman said. 
She said straws are an easy way to divert waste from going to landfills. The straw ban is also a victory for student activists who may feel like their efforts do not always affect change on campus, Shaw-Wakeman said.
“To see when you work toward something that things can actually change, that’s great because it shows in the future other things are going to change,” she said.
ESA co-director Olivia Pearson, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, said eliminating straws is the beginning of more sustainable dining halls. 
“The straw ban in dining halls was just the first step,” Pearson said. “We would like to continue doing other things that show we’re purchasing things with sustainability in mind.”
According to Pearson, more sustainable purchasing practices were mentioned in a letter asking for a sustainable campus sent to University President C. L. Max Nikias Monday on behalf of ESA, USG and ECore. The letter was sent in conjunction with ECore’s “Do Better” rally taking place Friday, which intends to call attention to USC’s shortcomings in sustainability, Pearson said. 
“We’re hoping that [Nikias] will hear the students that will come out on Friday,” Pearson said. “Environmental activism starts at this grassroots level and we’re hoping with these small victories we can show that there’s a lot of student interest.”

Undergraduate Student Government President-elect Debbie Lee and Vice President-elect Blake Ackerman were sworn in Tuesday, along with the new Senate. Lee delivered her inaugural speech after taking the presidential oath.
Lee addressed wellness in her speech and identified it as a central issue at USC. 
Tuesday was the last Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting for the 2017-18 USG administration. Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan
“Blake and I believe that accomplishing this vision [of making USC a home for all] starts with focusing on our campus climate,” Lee said. “Whether it be a shift in the way that we dispose of food to eliminate food waste or following through on the work of our first-year experience course where students have the opportunity and space to learn more about inclusivity and discuss prevalent issues faced by students today.”
Lee also stressed the importance of building and maintaining a relationship with administrators and other communities on campus. 
“Our community truly begins to thrive when this sentiment of care and support is also felt by students from the University and its administration,” Lee said. “That is why we plan to increase the transparency of where tuition dollars are going at our University and why we will work with administrators to formalize a relationship with the Greek community and all communities on this campus.”
Before Lee’s speech, the USG Senate also passed a resolution and three bylaw amendments unanimously during its final meeting before the new Senate was sworn in. The resolution, which aims to enhance the experiences of students admitted in the spring, was proposed last week.
The resolution calls for the formation of a committee comprising students admitted in spring semesters and USC administrators to make changes to the current process of welcoming and integrating these students into the campus community. The measure was suggested in an effort to satisfy issues brought up by students in surveys. 
The senate also passed three bylaw amendments. The first bylaw amendment clarified the role of the Chief Diversity Officer position in USG and how it will be selected in future years. The amendment also required that a USG official serve on the Norman Topping Governing Board.
The second bylaw amendment reduced the minimum number of signatures required to present a referendum to USG to be approved for the ballot. The minimum number of signatures was reduced from 10 percent of the undergraduate student population to five percent. For a referendum to pass, the bylaw will now require at least 20 percent of undergraduates to vote on the measure with a majority in support.
Senators debated the exact minimum number of signatures. Then-Senators Noah Silver and Ackerman argued that a higher minimum would allow future referendums to carry more weight and legitimacy. Senator Katie Bolton and USG Director of External Affairs Mai Mizuno argued that the minimum needed to be lower since referendums had not been proposed for decades.
The third bylaw amendment was the End of Year bylaw amendment, which focused on creating transparency in the official rules and guidelines of USG and on facilitating a smooth transition to the next administration. 
Now-former USG President Austin Dunn guided the senate through the amendments and attempted to provide clarification where he could regarding tweaks to the bylaws. Several of the changes were issues of feasibility such as the required bimonthly town hall meetings for the vice president, which were removed because the past several administrations were unable to fulfill this requirement.

The USC Department of Public Safety issued three crime alerts warning the students, faculty and staff of multiple cell phone robberies around campus, including at least two that involved a firearm.
During two of the past three cell phone robberies, the victims were approached by suspects with handguns. Daily Trojan File Photo.
“We have had a number of students who have lost their cell phones, and one of the common factors is that students are walking alone, sometimes after dark, talking on their phones and not paying attention to their surroundings,” DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said.
The first incident was reported last Saturday night. Two suspects in a dark sedan  approached a student. One of the suspects punched the student in the face and forcefully took his cell phone, according to the USC DPS Safety Logs. Both suspects fled the scene. 
The next two offenses reported Tuesday took place at the same location, according to the fire and safety logs. 
“We believe that the suspects are similar in nature, based on the descriptions,” DPS Crime Analyst Wyman Thomas said. “Of course, clothing easily changes from day to day, but based on the general descriptions provided by the victims, we believe that they are pretty much the same individuals.” 
In the second incident, the suspects were parked on Royal Street. They confronted and threatened a student with a handgun, demanding her cell phone and money. The victim eventually handed over her personal belonging to the suspects. 
“Using a handgun is unusual,” Carlisle said. “We are working with LAPD to try and resolve these crimes and capture these suspects.”
In the third case Tuesday, the suspects also threatened another student with a handgun in order to take her phone. The suspects drove away down Figueroa Street. 
According to Carlisle, in response to these reports, DPS has re-deployed security ambassadors, camera operators and DPS officers into the crime areas. 
“If you’re in a similar situation, surrender your property right away,” DPS Sergeant Steve Alegre said. “There is nothing worth being injured for when it comes to somebody trying to rob them of their phone or their backpack or purse or whatever the case may be. We highly recommend that you surrender your stuff when asked and then try to get the best description you possibly can.”
DPS encourages all USC students to download the free USC safety application “LiveSafe.” According to Carlisle, the application turns student phones  into personal emergency blue light phones, which are located throughout campus. Students can also call DPS via the application. 
According to Carlisle, calling will sound an alarm to the communication center so the students are immediately put in touch with dispatchers. Even if the students are in a situation where they are unable to speak, the application can track the student’s  location through a GPS system and send help.
“We’re asking for our students’ help,” Carlisle said. “One, if they see something, say something and report any suspicious persons to DPS. And two, to do their part by following our crime prevention tips so they don’t become a victim.”

Steven Spielberg took on quite a challenge directing the dystopian cyberpunk adaptation of Ready Player One. Unlike some of his safer directing choices lately, like The Post, Spielberg’s Ready Player One takes on the new and constantly evolving technology of virtual reality. The movie stars Tye Sheridan, who plays Wade Watts, an orphaned teenager determined to save the virtual reality world of OASIS from an evil corporation. By solving riddles left posthumously by the designer of the virtual universe, Wade teams up with a group of other gamers in search of an “Easter egg” within the game designed to grant the finder control over the digital universe’s future.

First and foremost, the movie is a celebration of achievement in the field of computer-generated imagery. The majority of the action within the film occurs within the OASIS world and includes the virtual avatars of each character. The animation presents an incredible use of extremely realistic digital textures that embraces a video game-inspired artistic aesthetic. The visual design of the universe within the OASIS is astonishing, from vibrant, colorful night clubs to war-torn, desolate planets. However, this movie offers much more than just stunning visuals.
The soundtrack of the film brings the energy of the ’80s to the theater. Spielberg opens the film with Van Halen’s 1983 chart-topper, “Jump.” The high energy synth pop immediately floods the theater with a sense of magic and nostalgia. Featuring songs like “You Make My Dreams” by Daryl Hall & John Oates and “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Tears For Fears, Spielberg pieces together a musical tour of the decade. The further inclusion of “One Way or Another” by Blondie and “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister truly captures the rebellious spirit of the ’80s manifest in the plot.
Packed thoroughly with references to pop culture, Ready Player One pulls the audience through a nostalgic journey that looks back at the best of the ’80s. With a particularly inventive parody of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, the film recreates the Overlook Hotel in which the movie took place. Spielberg’s homage to Kubrick creates a golden comedic atmosphere in which characters unfamiliar with Kubrick’s plot hilariously spar against the film’s villains. These pop culture references within the film serve as their own form of Easter eggs for audiences to catch while watching. Though Spielberg’s constant nods to pop culture references feel oversaturated at times, they remain well executed throughout the entire film.
The movie, however, was not perfect. It lacked certain elements of character development that many critics complain were present in the original novel by Ernest Cline on which the movie is based. Indeed, Wade’s character undergoes extremely minimal character dynamics within the plot. His emotional development never seems to extend beyond building a romantic relationship with another character, and he does not seem to have matured much by the end of the film. Further, Sheridan’s portrayal of Wade offers a limited range of facial expressions that makes many of his scenes emotionally flat and tedious to watch. Ben Mendelsohn’s portrayal of the movie’s central villain, Sorrento, is particularly one-dimensional and unexciting. Mendelsohn fills his diabolical plotting with common tropes, and his acting feels unbelievable at times.
Ultimately, the themes within Ready Player One resonate deeply in today’s increasingly digital and corporatized world. The Black Mirror-esque digital dystopia offers insight into the overwhelming negative implications for human reliance on digital means of escapism. The issue of class warfare and corporate control of our digital lives comes through particularly heavily, given the current tumultuous climate of corporate interference in people’s digital lives, as in the case of Facebook’s privacy invasions and data surveillance. Spielberg’s contribution to this dialogue is as timely as it is successful.

USC Village welcomes its second clothing store with the opening of Kaitlyn Clothing, a “SoCal style destination” women’s clothing shop located across from Starbucks. After the opening of their flagship location in Downtown Brea and the re-opening of their online store in 2014, Kaitlyn Clothing has expanded its brand through pop-up shops, fashion truck meets and social media.
Photo from Facebook.
Kaitlyn sells clothing for women of all ages, and stocks brands such as Lush, Cotton Candy, Sub-Urban Riot, Brandy Melville, Dolce Vita, Free People, Havaianas, House of Harlow, Junkfood and BB Dakota. Kaitlyn offers an in-house brand as well.
From outside the shop, an orange rectangular sign is lettered with a thin, sans serif white logo spelling out “Kaitlyn” in all capital letters. Mannequins pose behind tall glass windows, displaying outfits that remind passersby of springtime. The store’s linen fabrics, in bright neutrals and warmer tones, are popular in the store. 
Once inside, the fresh white walls reflect the natural light that pours in, and the lightly grained wood adds to the clean, minimalistic design. Soft sounds of indie pop and beachy music fill the room. There are racks of clothes scattered around the space, with each rack acting as a collective of a similar type of clothing. It lends to a bit of a cluttered feel, but one that is characteristic of the boho-chic boutique. 
On the rack closest to the entrance, some striped long-sleeved blouses are grouped together, while swingy tank tops hang together on the other side of the room. Full-length dresses in tones of coral and mustard yellow or various floral print designs hang on the back wall. An entire shelf is reserved for denim on the side, and handbags are strewn throughout the store.
Sunglasses cheaper than $15 sit on a table in the center of the shop. Along with clothing and accessories, the store offers fun houseware items. On the right wall sits an assortment of stemless wine glasses, beer cups and sealable glass tumblers, all adorned with golden lettering. There are some trinket trays and jewelry display ceramics in fun shapes, such as cacti, pineapples and doughnuts. 
Their Instagram and Twitter account often display the stores’ sales and newest items, including a 10 percent off sale going on right now. 
USC Village’s Kaitlyn Clothing will celebrate its grand opening Thursday at 10 a.m., in an event featuring discounts, desserts and other free items.

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
It should come as no surprise that, as a kid, I was a voracious reader. After blazing my way through the Harry Potter series and whatnot, my third grade teacher recommended that I read The Penderwicks: A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy.
“You’re going to love it,” she told me. “It’s one of my favorite children’s books.” 
She was right, of course. I did love it, and it’s also become one of my favorite children’s books. Obviously, it’s not some brilliant, experimental, genre-bending piece of literature, and it may not have the same nostalgic effect on first-time adult readers who didn’t grow up with the characters. But, because I did, it is near and dear to my heart.
The Penderwicks tells the story of four sisters, their father and their dog. They are on their way to Arundel, a gorgeous, sprawling estate where they have rented a cottage for the summer. There’s Rosalind, the oldest, practical yet romantic; Skye, stubborn and hot-headed but fiercely loyal; Jane, a fanciful, head-in-the-clouds type who never goes anywhere without her notebook; and shy little Batty, whose constant companions are the family dog, Hound, and her butterfly wings. They meet a boy named Jeffrey, the son of Arundel’s owner, and, with a whole three months to exhaust, plenty of adventures ensue. 
Growing up in the cookie cutter SoCal suburbs, I yearned for the childhood described in The Penderwicks — that singularly New England experience characterized by dusty attics and musty basements, rambling pastures and mysterious forests where magic shimmered in the air. My own backyard consisted of a little rectangular concrete garden where a few scraggly roses and a prickly honeysuckle bush struggled to eke out a living. I remember eyeing the banal plastic blinds that shuttered my bedroom window and aching instead for an airy bay window with a window seat where I could curl up with a blanket and a book.

And, also, as an only child, I dreamed of siblings; the Penderwicks’ constant chaos, affectionate arguments and lively hijinks cut through the silence of my afternoons while I waited for both my parents to come home from work. Siblings would always keep you company if you wanted it; and if you didn’t, you were free to wander off on your own for a bit and dream, and everyone would have the good sense to leave you alone — at least until it was time for dinner, anyway. 
When I first read The Penderwicks, I was eight years old, somewhere between 10-year-old Jane and four-year-old Batty. Over the years, as author Jeanne Birdsall has released sequels, the characters have grown up and hit all their milestones, right alongside me. So far, Birdsall has published four out of five books in the series: The Penderwicks, The Penderwicks on Gardam Street, The Penderwicks at Point Mouette and The Penderwicks in Spring. The final installment, Penderwicks at Last, is set to be released May 15. Batty will be in college. Someone is getting married. I’m definitely going to cry. 
The Penderwicks have been my pseudo siblings, characters I love like my own family. The memories of my own youth are woven into those of Rosalind, Skye, Jane and Batty. I read the books during a road trip through Utah, utterly disregarding the sweeping views; in the green room backstage amid rehearsals for Coppelia; while waiting for my friends to finish their swimming lessons, the smell of chlorine in my nose and the poolside breeze fluttering the pages. 
Rereading The Penderwicks now, more than a decade after I first picked it up, I am instantly transported back to the bright, unadulterated joys of childhood, the hazy euphoria of summer vacation — long days and golden twilights, climbing trees and catching fireflies, “growing up” a distant concept residing beyond the warm and endless days stretching out before me, full of promise.

USC’s baseball team entered Tuesday’s road game against UC Santa Barbara at a bit of a crossroads. After starting the season 10-5, the Trojans had dropped seven of their last 10 games, falling to 14-11 on the year. The bats had gone quiet and the pitching staff wasn’t helping either. After losing the last two games of their previous series against Washington, USC got back on track with a 9-3 road win over UCSB.

Things didn’t start out well for the Trojans as Santa Barbara’s designated hitter Clay Fisher hit a 2-run home run in the first inning off of freshman starter John Beller. However, the recently dormant lineup erupted to give the team a much-needed lift.
A single in the top of the second inning from sophomore catcher Blake Sabol drove in sophomore center fielder Matthew Acosta to get the Trojans on the board. Two sacrifice flies from junior first baseman Dillon Paulson and Acosta in the next inning gave USC a 2-run edge by the end of the third.
Sabol continued his hot hitting in the fifth inning, singling to right to score Acosta and junior first baseman Dillon Paulson. Paulson would contribute an RBI of his own with a double in the next inning, driving in freshman second baseman Ben Ramirez.
Acosta took advantage of several blunders from Santa Barbara to put the game away in the late innings. 
First, he hit a solo home run to right center in the top of the seventh, his third bomb of the season, making the margin 7-2. After redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb singled and advanced to second on a wild pitch, Acosta reached first on a throwing error by Gaucho third baseman Drew Williams, with Dubb coming around to score on the play. Finally, after advancing to third, Acosta scored on a passed ball, giving the Trojans 9 runs, the highest number since their Feb. 24 match against Villanova.
Sabol led the way, going 3-5 with three RBIs on the day. Including his home run, Acosta scored four times, a career-high. Junior centerfielder Lars Nootbaar, Bushor and freshman right fielder Jamal O’Guinn also had multiple hits, contributing to a strong team effort at the plate.
“We got some clutch hits and clutch at-bats with men in scoring position, and that’s what we haven’t been getting,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the game,  on the official USC baseball Twitter account. “It was nice to see guys with multiple hits on the day and not just a bunch of one-hit days.”
Beller, making his first collegiate start, shook off the slow start to perform admirably for USC. The lefty went six innings, giving up only the 2 runs in the first and striking out four Gauchos, earning his second win on the season. Hubbs said he thought Beller gave the team “a shot in the arm” in his first start in college. 
Beller referenced a second inning mound visit from Hubbs as key in bouncing back from the first inning home run.
“I was really just able to reevaluate everything and trust myself a little bit,” Beller said. “I just got more and more confidence as the game went on, not only because of some help from the defense but the bats also got going.”
Freshman pitcher Isaac Esqueda came on to relieve Beller in the seventh, giving up one run on a two-out walk with the bases loaded in the ninth inning. Freshman Brian Gursky came in to get the final out, wrapping up the score at 9-3.
The Trojans will need more hitting performances like this to give their young pitchers some cushion. Freshmen on the mound can crack under the pressure when the game is entirely in their hands but, as Beller said, some run protection can free them up to play their best.
“I mean, I really can’t ask for much else, we put up 9 runs today,” Beller said. “It’s great to pitch with a lead like that, and I’m just glad I was able to get it done for the boys.”
Next, the Trojans continue on the road for a weekend series in Tempe against Arizona State.

Spring camp rolled on Tuesday for the USC football team as they hit the field once again, with only five practices left. This was their first practice after last Saturday’s scrimmage, which saw a less-than-impressive offensive showing. Much of today’s practice was devoted to fixing Friday’s mistakes, especially from the quarterbacks.
Bouncing Back

The scrimmage last week should have provided some much needed clarity on the quarterback depth chart. Instead, the disappointing performances of the prospective quarterbacks only raised more questions about the group’s future.
“[The quarterbacks] were getting their eyes on the right spot,” head coach Clay Helton said about Saturday’s scrimmage. “They were just needing to get the ball out a little bit quicker.” 
Redshirt freshman Jack Sears had an especially rough outing, throwing two interceptions and struggling to connect on most of his passes. 
Redshirt sophomore Matt Fink was steadier, throwing no picks and completing many of his passes, yet he remained unspectacular, not taking shots down the field or attempting difficult throws. 
“We got a long way to go,” new quarterback coach Bryan Ellis said. “There were some positives, but when you come out and turn the ball over that many times, we’re not gonna win games doing that.” 
Ellis was more pleased with the passers’ progress on the field on Tuesday, though he still sees plenty of room for improvement. 
“We came out here and got a little better today,” Ellis said. 
Injury Watch
Senior “predator” linebacker Porter Gustin continued his strong spring as he returns from the toe injury that kept him out for most of last season. 
Helton pointed out that “[Gustin] looks basically unblockable,” after he dominated offensive linemen for much of the day, including a would-be sack that would probably have sent the quarterback to the ER had it been a real game.
Standout junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. returned to practice after missing time last week due to a shoulder injury. After practice, Pittman proclaimed that his shoulder “has never been better,” going on to describe the injury as only a minor stinger. 
Pittman has had a solid spring camp, likely cementing his role as a starting receiver opposite redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns. 
“I’ve been adding more to my route running,” Pittman said. “Before, I kinda relied on my physicality, and now I feel like I’m trying to be more of a route runner so I can add that to my tool box.”
Redshirt sophomore running back Vavae Malepeai performed well in practice, as he returns from a few minor injuries that have nagged him for the past week. He impressed in the run segments of practice, showing his normal power and burst.
Senior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga was pulled from practice due to a lower back injury, while junior linebacker Jordan Iosefa suffered a knee injury and needed to be pulled from the field. Helton mentioned that Iosefa’s injury did not seem major.

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
USC football is now in its fourth week of spring football practice, and head coach Clay Helton seems to have made little progress in selecting Sam Darnold’s successor at starting quarterback. 
That isn’t necessarily alarming, as teams holding quarterback competitions usually wait until fall practice to settle on a starting signal caller. Helton himself has said the decision could be made as late as a week before the Trojans’ first game against UNLV. 
However, what is alarming is how USC quarterbacks have performed in practice so far. The team held a live scrimmage on Saturday and both redshirt sophomore Matt Fink and redshirt freshman Jack Sears struggled to complete passes under pressure. 
“My initial gut said that we weren’t very good,” Helton told the Los Angeles Times. “I can’t tell you [how] much more live reps we need.” 
Right now, Fink and Sears are the top two contenders for the job, with redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas coming in at a distant third. None of them has played meaningful in-game action for USC — the only real glimmer of potential from the group came when Fink rushed for a 51-yard touchdown against Oregon State last season. 
Fink has drawn the most praise from coaches and fellow players thus far, but mostly during non-contact 7-on-7 drills. His ability to run the ball is what sets him apart from USC’s other quarterbacks, but his throwing remains unrefined. Meanwhile, Sears — who graduated from San Clemente high school, where Darnold also played — is the most pro-style passer of the bunch. But he’s struggled with interceptions ever since arriving on campus last spring. 
Right now, USC’s quarterback options seem less than inspiring. Fink and Sears both have potential and deserve the benefit of the doubt due to a lack of experience, but still, it’s difficult to see either having the same type of impact that Darnold did in his first year at starting quarterback.

There is, however, a giant elephant in the room, with incoming five-star recruit JT Daniels set to enroll in the fall. The 18-year-old reclassified to join the class of 2018 after leading Mater Dei to a state title as a junior in 2017. While he hasn’t been competing with the team in spring, he’s been a regular attendee at practice in an effort to soak up the playbook before officially joining the team. 
Daniels possesses the highest upside of USC’s quarterbacks by a wide margin. He threw for over 12,000 in three high school seasons, with 152 touchdown passes and only 14 interceptions. The deadly accurate passer added another dimension to his game as a junior, when he rushed for 561 yards and 9 touchdowns leading his team to a 15-0 perfect season. 
He has all the tools to be a successful USC quarterback — a big arm, composure, mobility and a history of winning. Plus, he’ll already have chemistry with wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, a fellow five-star also set to arrive in the fall. In high school, they linked up for nearly 3,000 yards and over 40 touchdowns. 
Barring injury, Daniels will almost certainly be USC’s quarterback at some point — but he’s not a lock to start this season. With his senior year of high school bypassed, Daniels enters the 2018 season as one of the youngest quarterbacks in the nation. He still needs time to develop his slim 6’2”, 210-pound frame, and he won’t have much time to learn the playbook in a hands-on fashion. Attending spring practice is a step in the right direction, but Daniels’ education doesn’t really begin until he takes live reps. 
Therefore, Helton could find himself in a tough spot when choosing a starter in August. If Fink and Sears continue to struggle and Daniels displays his youth in fall camp, there will be no clear-cut decision. USC’s roster is stacked with talented pass-catchers, like Tyler Vaughns (809 yards,  5 touchdowns in 2017) and junior Michael Pittman Jr. (404 yards, 2 touchdowns), but without a viable option at quarterback, their talent could go underutilized.
Helton’s impending decision will prove to be a defining moment in his career, as the next Trojan quarterback will shape the program’s success in 2018 and beyond. Helton simply can’t afford to bungle another competition like he did in 2016 when he initially chose Max Browne over Darnold heading into their season-opener against Alabama.
When USC plays UNLV on Sept. 1, there will be a new, untested quarterback under center. The choice of who will occupy this role may be Helton’s toughest and most important task to date.
