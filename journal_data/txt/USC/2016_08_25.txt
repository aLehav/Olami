Two graduate students from the School of Cinematic Arts received nominations earlier this month for Student Academy Awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Halima Lucas, a student pursuing an MFA within the production department, worked on her film, Amelia’s Closet, for her Thesis 581 class. Lucas did everything herself, from developing ideas to post-production. She credits her success to her team’s cohesiveness. 
“It has been an amazing collaborative effort from an amazing team,” Lucas said in an interview with the Cinematic Arts department. “We made the film on God’s grace and gaff tape.”
Lucas’ story of an 11-year-old girl learning how to face harsh words received recognition under the Narrative category. She is one of seven finalists.
“I was stunned and humbled,” Lucas said. “I couldn’t wait to tell the team what we had accomplished. Truly it came together with a team of people who were passionate about the story and deeply committed to the project no matter what we were facing or resources we had.”
Lucas worked closely with Helaine Head, an associate professor at SCA. Head mentored Lucas, offering advice and strengthening her direction. According to Head, Lucas’ story captured a perspective not commonly told.
“I thought her ideas were great,” Head said. “She had a very personal and unique point of view and experiences not everybody had. She’s a really talented filmmaker who has some interesting ideas and more stories to tell that we would be interested in seeing.”
But Head didn’t overwhelm Lucas with guidance. He let her have her own artistic direction to enhance her learning experience.
“She can address the problems the way she wants, as opposed to saying, ‘You should put this here,’” Head said, “The object of this exercise was so that people can make a film that reflects their point of view. That will make them stronger when they leave here.”
Head felt that Lucas’ production style aligned with the school’s stance on diversity. The school’s admissions team has tried to foster diversity by hiring faculty from different backgrounds and expanding academic opportunities, according to an SCA statement.
“This is a place that tries to foster the vision of the students who come here, and we get students that come from a lot of different places and points of view within the United States,” Head said. “Hopefully, they’ll be part of a new wave. Halima will be one of the people who will change the stories that are told and how they will be told.”
The Student Academy Awards were established in 1972, and its awardees have included industry giants such as Robert Zemeckis, Spike Lee and Trey Parker, according to the Academy. Student candidates cannot apply individually, but need the endorsement of a faculty adviser in their film school to be considered for an award.
Alicja Jasina, a master’s student from the John C. Hench Division of Animation & Digital Arts, created the short film Once Upon a Line. Her story features how a man escapes his dull life by falling in love. She was nominated under the Animation category.
The awards ceremony will take place Sept. 22. The University has had long-standing success with Student Academy Awards, with their first victory dating back to 1975. Last year, then-graduate student Alexandre Peralta won the gold medal in the Documentary category for his film Looking at the Stars.

Researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have identified two protein molecules that may be responsible for the harmful effects of the Zika virus on unborn children. 
The findings, which were published in the scientific journal “Cell Stem Cell” on Aug. 11, may lead to the development of a vaccine preventing these proteins from inhibiting fetal brain formation. The researchers received support from the Hastings Foundation, Fletcher Jones Foundation, Global Research Lab Program, National Research Foundation of Korea, Alzheimer’s Association and the Cure for Alzheimer’s Fund. 
In the past year, Zika cases have increased exponentially in South and Central America, leading to greater awareness of the illness and its effects. The virus, transmitted by mosquito bites and, in some cases, sexual activity, oftentimes produces no severe or long-lasting symptoms. In fact, about 80 percent of infected individuals do not experience any symptoms, according to Jae Jung, a professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Keck. Instead, the virus proves most dangerous when it infects pregnant mothers, causing microcephaly in their newborns.
“Pregnancy is a different case than regular healthy individuals,” Jung said. “We don’t know exactly why, but pregnant women are sometimes highly susceptible to some viral infections such as Zika. Surprisingly, the Zika virus crosses the placenta and infects the fetus and ultimately blocks fetal brain development.”
The two proteins, NS4A and NS4B, have caused microcephaly in thousands of infants born from Zika-infected mothers. This collaborative endeavor between the virology and neurobiology disciplines is the first to examine Zika virus on a molecular level, with researchers analyzing human neural stem cells from second-trimester fetuses. 
“Cells that are determined to produce nerve cells that are called neural stem cells. These cells, when infected with Zika virus, stop proliferating,” said Berislav Zlokovic, director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at Keck. “They are also unable to position themselves in the nervous system during the development process. Fetuses are affected more than adults because they depend completely on growth whereas adults already have formed brains.”
Jung and his team of researchers came to the conclusion that NS4A and NS4B proteins are the ones that result in the formation of unusually small brains by studying three strains of Zika in second trimester human fetal neural stem cells. They found that these microcephaly-causing proteins obstruct the Akt-mTOR pathway, which is responsible for autophagy, or the recycling of pathogens. Blocking the pathway allows Zika and other viruses to multiply. As a result of the energy Zika virus is using to proliferate, the neuronal stem cells are left with metabolic deficits, thereby severely inhibiting their ability to mature into neurons and other brain cell types.
Moreover, the study found that when these proteins, NS4A and NS4B, interfere with fetal neural stem cells, the size of brain organoids was cut in half. The proteins also inhibited the growth of fetal neural stem cells by 65 percent, and the ability of these stem cells to mature into brain cells was reduced by up to 51 percent. These decreases manifest in infants as microcephaly, a condition that severely limits cognition and overall health. 
Moving forward, the USC researchers will test the function of NS4A and NS4B proteins in mouse models and brain organoids. 
“A vaccine is already under development,” said Zhen Zao, an assistant professor of research physiology and biophysics in an email to the Daily Trojan. “However, therapeutic antibodies targeting Zika NS4A and 4B proteins may also work.”

The football team held its final practice of the week Thursday evening at Howard Jones field. In what was mostly a series of walk-throughs, the Trojans wrapped up their “mock week” — a week-long simulation of what the regular season practice routine will look like for the team. 
No. 20 USC now enters its final week of preparation for its season-opening matchup against the reigning national champion, No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide on Sept. 3. 
Fighting Freshmen
Over the course of the offseason, the strength of USC’s nationally acclaimed 2016 recruiting class has been on full display. While the freshmen make up a majority of the bottom-half of the depth chart for the Trojans, the talent which USC’s youth possesses has broken through on several occasions throughout summer workouts and Fall Camp. 
If the talent of these freshmen is evident, then the confidence which they bear on the field is that plus more. Following Wednesday’s practice, freshman cornerback Jack Jones told reporters that he expects to win the Heisman Award this season; he is currently listed at third on the depth chart.
“The thing that I really appreciate about these freshmen coming in is that they’re confident,” head coach Clay Helton said. “They feel like they’re the best in the world, and that’s the approach you’ve got to take. I want that. I want them to go out there and think, ‘I can beat anyone in the world.’”
With regards to the offense, USC imports five standout freshmen into its receiving corps this season. One of the more notable performers among the freshman wideouts this summer has been Michael Pittman Jr. 
“[Pittman] reminds you a little bit of a Robert Woods; he’s coming up to get extra film and doing things on his own as a student of the game to really propel himself,” Helton said. “He’s put himself in a position to contribute — not only on offense, but also on special teams.”
it’s a special battle
An offseason position battle has developed within the Trojans’ special teams unit. Redshirt sophomores Reid Budrovich and Chris Tilbey are battling for starting punter duties for the upcoming season. 
“We had a very honest conversation,” Helton said. “I brought both [Budrovich and Tilbey] in at the same time, and [told them that the position of] punter is almost like quarterback — it’s about who’s producing at the right time.” 
The special teams unit has been an area of focus for Helton and special teams coordinator John Baxter throughout the offseason. Field goal kicking and kickoff execution have been areas of emphasis for the team during its preparation for Alabama. 
Kicker Matt Boermeester, a redshirt junior, has made vast improvements in his kicking over the summer. 
“Coach Baxter has done a tremendous job of taking the draw out of [Boermeester’s] ball,” Helton said. “[Baxter] has really helped him become a consistent kicker.”
The Trojans resume practice next Tuesday with less than a week until their season opener against the Crimson Tide.

It was a tough end to the season when the women’s volleyball team lost in five sets to No. 9 Kansas in the regional final of the NCAA tournament last December. But this season, the team is back and preparing for another deep playoff run. In 2015, the Women of Troy were expected to place fifth in the Pac-12, but instead dominated the tournament and finished first. They went into the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed.
This year, the Women of Troy open the regular season ranked No. 7 and will host the Baden Invitational this weekend. As part of the tournament, USC will face off against Marquette, Santa Clara and UC Irvine.
Going into this year, the team is experiencing various personnel changes that may alter the course of their season. Samantha Bricio and Alicia Ogoms, both huge contributors to the 2015 team, graduated in May, leaving opportunity for younger players to step up this season.
Joining the team this year are four freshmen: Outside hitter Khalia Lanier, opposite hitter Daley Krage and liberos Noelle Pardo and Raegan LeGrand. Lanier was named the Gatorade National Volleyball Player of the Year in 2016. Adding to that group are two transfers: Junior setter Nikki Leonard and sophomore middle blocker Madison Murtagh. Both transfers are capable of playing this season and may have an impact on the starting roster.
Also joining the roster is senior setter Alexa Strange, who has been competing as a member of the two-time national championship beach volleyball team. In 2016, she earned Pac-12 All-Conference team honors and scored the determining point in various dual victories for USC.
Returning junior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie is also expected to help the Trojans this season. Standing at 6-foot-2, Abercrombie was named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team last season. She also recorded career highs with a .500 hitting percentage, 16 kills against Washington State and 35 attacks against Colorado.
Returning seniors include libero Taylor Whittingham, middle blocker Elise Ruddins and setter Alice Pizzasegola. Whittingham was named to the 2016 Pac-12 Volleyball All-Star team and led the team with 611 digs. In 2015, Ruddins started in each of the 36 matches the Trojans played and finished with 193 kills. Pizzasegola also appeared in all 36 matches as a setter last season and received a Pac-12 All-Academic honorable mention.
The Trojans are coached for the 16th straight season by head coach Mick Haley. He has led the team to two national championships and 15 NCAA Tournament appearances. This Friday, the team will play their first game against Marquette at 8 p.m. The Women of Troy then play two games on Saturday, facing off against Santa Clara in a 10 a.m. tilt followed by a game against UC Irvine at 8 p.m.

They packed the Coliseum, buying every seat available — for a preseason game. Ten thousand more seats were opened up, and those were snatched up too.
Apparently, that’s what happens when you bring the NFL back to Los Angeles, a city starved for professional football since the Rams and Raiders both left in 1994.
Now, the Rams are back, and L.A. sports fans are soaking it up like the second coming of Christ. A crowd of 91,000 crammed and sweated its way into the NFL’s temporary new home in the City of Angels to watch a game that didn’t count, with third stringers getting as much playing time as the starters.
But that didn’t seem to matter. It was one giant party celebrating the return of America’s most popular sports league. The Rams could have trotted out JaMarcus Russell at quarterback and the hoopla would have been the same.
Still, the Rams occupying the Coliseum is an interesting test-case for how a large market will adapt to a new professional team, and the questions should begin with how much interest there will actually be in the Rams.
The last time the Rams played a home game in Southern California was Christmas Eve 1994, when they wrapped up an uninspired 4-12 season with a loss to the 3-13 Redskins in front of an abysmal 25,705 fans in Anaheim. The situation was so hopeless, the team so behind in the vast Los Angeles sports landscape that the owner packed up and moved the team from Hollywood to the Midwest.
“Once the bridges have been burned and people get turned off on a sports franchise, years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back,” former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said to The New York Times.
It’s difficult to say whether those words will ring true now as the Rams’ attempt to woo back the fanbase that they deserted some 20-odd years ago. For one, as popular as football was back in the ’90s, the sport has taken off since the turn of the century, and fantasy sports have exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry. People will live, breathe and eat anything football-related, no matter which teams are playing.
Perhaps just as important is the fact that a whole generation of football fans living in Los Angeles grew up without an NFL team to support. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Rams are targeting millennials through social media to expand their fanbase, a perfect age group to target, because while they may not remember the Rams in Los Angeles growing up, their allegiances to other teams could be trumped by the hometown squad that just moved in.
A good first impression is also a must — the Rams know this. It’s why they put all their chips on the table and traded up for the No. 1 pick in the draft this year to select Jared Goff, who they hope to be their franchise quarterback.
At this rate, though, the Rams may have to stress patience over immediate gratification. Goff has struggled in practice, and it’s looking more and more likely that Case Keenum will start the year at quarterback. It’s safe to say fans will not pay ridiculous ticket prices to watch Case Keenum be the centerpiece of the franchise.
Which leads to the elephant in the room: Will there be enough football craze in Los Angeles to share between USC and UCLA — two storied college programs with strong attendance figures — and an NFL team? Will college football fans who usually just tune in on Saturdays start planning their Sundays around the Rams’ schedule? On weekends where either USC or UCLA is at home at the same time as the Rams, will fans go for the weekend doubleshot or just stay home on Sunday after a tiring Saturday at the game?
There are two weekends this season when USC and the Rams both play at the Coliseum (USC vs. Colorado on Oct. 8, followed by Rams vs. Buffalo Bills on Oct. 9 and USC vs. Oregon on Nov. 5, followed by Rams vs. Carolina Panthers on Nov. 6). It will be very interesting to compare the attendance of the games, and — because there is guaranteed to be football at the Coliseum almost every week — whether USC students take up the opportunity to watch an NFL game in their own backyard.
A simple solution to any concern regarding interest would be winning. Winning cures everything: attracting fans, sponsors and the spotlight, which is especially important in the second largest media market in the country.
Unfortunately, the Rams may not be doing a whole lot of that right out of the gate. Pro Football Focus predicts that they will finish tied for the worst record in the NFC at 4-12. Rams Head Coach Jeff Fisher, who could write a how-to guide on coaching mediocre, .500 teams, would probably be happy with an 8-8 season and a flash in the pan from Goff.
But, in the case that the team struggles, here’s the question: 91,000 people may pack the Coliseum for a preseason NFL game just to check out the shiny new toy, but how many will actually show up in Week 16 to watch a team with a 3-11 record?

This week, more than 400 first-generation college students began classes at USC. This year’s freshman class was the most selective in the University’s history, as more than 54,000 applications were received and roughly 17 percent were accepted. Of those that ended up coming to USC, approximately one fifth is the first in their families to attend college. 
USC has attempted to accommodate first-generation students and those from low-income and underprivileged neighborhoods. This year, more than $300 million went to financial aid for undergraduate students. Much of this aid goes to first-generation students, who comprised 14 percent of the student body in 2015. 
Connie Machuca is among the 400 first-generation students entering USC this fall. Machuca, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, remembers receiving her acceptance to USC with tears in her eyes, knowing that all her work had paid off. Machuca was born in Chicago to Ecuadorian parents, who encouraged her from a very young age to go to college. Machuca is proud to be a first-generation student, but has faced difficulties adapting to a way of life that her parents had no way to prepare her for.
“The hardest part is being in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people,” Machuca said. “Hopefully, I make a lot of friends and adapt to the environment quickly.” 
Machuca said that being away from her mother, who she considers her greatest motivator, has been the hardest part of going to college. 
“She struggled so much just to get ahead in this country. With an education, I can hopefully show her all her sacrifices were worth it,” Machuca said. 
Kelly Pascual, a freshman majoring in business administration who grew up in South Los Angeles, saw many of her peers in high school drop out without obtaining their diplomas. For Pascual, being a first-generation college student means setting an example for her community, though she admitted she has had to work harder because of her limited resources. 
Kelly was one of 20 graduates from USC’s Neighborhood Initiative, a middle and high school program which allows students from USC’s surrounding neighborhoods to attend the University on a full-tuition scholarship. 
Pascual also says her parents inspired her to be the first in her family to pursue a higher education. 
“My parents have reminded me to continue to work hard in school and to have an end goal in mind, like getting a good job,” Pascual said. 
Valeria Resendiz, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, was born in Mexico. Resendiz migrated to the United States when she was 3 and grew up in Oxnard, California. Throughout her adolescent years, the desire to help her family and encourage students from her high school to get a higher education, regardless of the challenges they may face, drove her decision to  attend college. 
“My parents always advised me to stay on track for school and not lose sight of my goals and to thank God each day for giving me such a grand opportunity,” Resendiz said. “I wanted to make a positive difference for my family and future generations.”
This desire to help others has kept her going despite difficulties adapting to a college environment, such as a lack of support in both academics and extracurriculars, that may come easily to many students whose parents have gone to college.
“The hardest part of college has been finding my way through this environment on my own, but at the same time, it is the most rewarding part,” Resendiz said. “I am paving the way for the success of others from disadvantaged backgrounds like my own.”

Women’s soccer makes a pair of short trips to Long Beach State and Pepperdine this weekend, as the Women of Troy seek their first two victories of the season. After suffering a tough overtime defeat at Santa Clara to open the season last week, USC will look to rebound with strong showings.
Despite opening the year with a narrow loss, the Women of Troy were arguably the superior team against Santa Clara. USC pulled ahead of the Broncos twice before eventually losing 2-3.
“We played really well for the first 30 minutes,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Then we got away from some of the things we wanted to do tactically throughout the rest of the game.”
Redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme agreed with her coach and was confident that the Women of Troy would iron out their issues by Friday night. Prudhomme was encouraged by the team’s early season friendlies (two wins by a combined score of 9-1), and she said the squad would improve as it logged more minutes as a unit.
“There were just a couple breakdowns on defense that we need to clean up, and I think we’ll be OK,” Prudhomme said. “The more we play and the more we’re together, it’ll feel more like an exhibition when we go out for a normal game.”
The loss to Santa Clara stings, but McAlpine said he was happy with his squad’s opening to the season.
“All in all, it was a good start,” McAlpine said. “We learned something by playing a team of that caliber early. Hopefully we’ll continue to grow and build off of that.”
There is still much growing left to do for USC. Ranked No. 11 in the nation in the preseason coaches’ poll, the Women of Troy harbor high ambitions for this season after making it to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2015 NCAA Tournament.
“Our goals are to win the Pac-12 championship and to win the national championship,” Prudhomme said. “I don’t think they’re unrealistic … if we do what we need to do.”
McAlpine was similarly excited about his team, but he knows that USC’s tournament run last year now puts a target on the Women of Troy’s back.
“This team has better talent than we had a year ago, but you still have to play the games,” McAlpine said. “This year, we’re not an underdog; people know that we’re talented and what we’re capable of. So we’re going to have to be a little bit more focused every game.”
The Women of Troy kick off at Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, and they take on Pepperdine in Malibu at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

Ellice Wang | Daily TrojanAll that and dim sum · Fertitta Cafe has a wide menu selection that allows customers to taste cuisine from different Asian cultures. The dumpling station has been a favorite among many students at the cafe.
With the beginning of the school year well underway, USC students have been flocking to Fertitta Cafe, located in the brand new Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall. Boasting of Asian-themed dining menu, one can find anything from dumplings to banh mi to sushi. Along with a wide variety of made-to-order dishes, customers can choose to purchase packaged snacks from a selection of popular Asian brands.
A favorite among many students at Fertitta Cafe, items such as pudding and mochi from local vendor Phoenix Dessert can be found in line to check out.
Danning Huang, a junior majoring in communication, chose the mango pudding during her visit and admitted her love for the brand. 
“I’m Chinese, and I actually really like this brand,” she said of Phoenix, a popular Cantonese food brand. “Before this year, I could only get this food outside, but now we got this kind of food here, so I think it’s very convenient, and I like it.”
Convenience definitely appears to be a reason for many students to visit Fertitta Cafe — whether it’s because they have classes in Fertitta Hall or because it offers a large selection of Asian food all in one campus location.
A business administration major, senior Cullen Mo has already spent a decent amount of time in Fertitta Hall for his classes and has stopped by the cafe for a meal twice. Like most other students, he agrees that the food is tasty, but he also shared his thoughts about the setup of the ordering stations. 
“I don’t think it’s laid out as well as it could be,” Mo said. “It just seems like it piles up towards the doorway, so I don’t know if they could direct some traffic towards the left or figure out a better payment system.”
Fertitta Cafe has six stations that serve bao, banh mi, dim sum, bowls, salads and sushi. It also sells snacks in line such as Pocky, Hello Panda, wasabi chips and shrimp chips. 
Due to its popularity this past week, it is difficult to navigate through the crowds of hungry students trying to order their food at the multiple stations and lines. However, after passing through the hectic checkout line, customers are greeted with a calm, ambient seating area. 
Like the rest of the building, Fertitta Cafe showcases a number of innovative design features —from touchscreens in the adjacent lounge to automatic spoon and fork dispensers in the dining area.
Many new dining venues peak in popularity when they first open, but Fertitta Cafe appears to be on its way to becoming a campus favorite.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
I went to an all-boys school in Sydney, Australia, my whole life before entering college. At 15, the only girls that I really talked to were my mother and my sister. My mom is my mom, and well, my sister was 7 at the time. I did not have a lot of experience with girls.
I remember every single time I talked to a girl I would get dinosaurs — no, not cute, sweet little butterflies, but huge, tutu-wearing dinosaurs — prancing around my stomach. I was absolutely horrendous at interacting with girls.
All until the fateful day that I met “Mom.” She was three years older than me and picked me up and “adopted” me as her son. Mom was a player. She got free dinners and free things all the time. And not in the way that most other people would acquire material things. Mom was conservative and she never had to, as the young, adolescent, grossly indoctrinated boys of my city called, “put out.” When I first met her she pointed to various clothing articles she had on. I met her scarf, jeans and designer heels: John, Vince and Tony respectively. They were the names of the boys that bought her those things, spoils from the battlefield she played on. 
She wanted to mentor me on how to be a player. So I started studying. Things I now take for granted as obvious like playing hard to get, being emotionally unavailable, push-pulls and eye-contact durations. For a 15-year-old boy whose last date was a tea-party with his 7-year-old sister, this stuff was legendary.
Manipulation and luring tactics ranged from simple things like always doubling the time taken to respond to messages to being rude all day and then slipping in a “sweet dreams” at night because then at least she’s thinking about you all day. One of the maneuvers I am not proud of talking about is the one called the “coffee-to-dinner conversion.” When meeting a girl who would usually not want to get dinner with a stranger because it was too forward, the coffee-to-dinner conversion entailed choosing a time to meet for coffee, waiting for said time to arrive and then texting said girl that you are terribly sorry you cannot make it — insert excuse related to 7-year-old sister crying and demanding you watch her ballet recital (yes, even when your sister didn’t even do ballet) — and promise to make it up to said girl. “Let me get you dinner, okay. I’m so sorry.”
I got pretty good with these lessons from Mom. But with all these people desiring my attention, it left me with a question: Did these people really like me for me, or because of the fake persona I had created?
And honestly, I started to realize that the person I was presenting was not me at all. I was scared to enter anything long-term because I knew that once these flings became real and they got to know the real me, they would soon realize that I was a fake.
And that’s when I stopped. Well, tried to stop. Withdrawal symptoms were very present for the next few years but over time I did begin to let go of the fake Samuel that I put out into the dating world. 
Which leads me to the gospel I wish to share. I have a pretty radical idea. Here it goes … When it comes to dating, we should be who we really are. 
 Being catfished through Tinder is definitely no fun. But why do we catfish people with our fake personalities?
You know what I’m talking about. That thing you do when you slowly let your weirdness out over time, after you’ve trapped your prey with enough history so they can’t turn back. While you may think that someone might not be interested in you if they knew who you really were, I want to say that that’s okay. They just aren’t meant for you. Do yourself and your potential partner a favor early and move on without the 2-year-old drama. Avoid hearing the “You aren’t the person I fell in love with” line. 
I challenge you to go about dating #nofilter. You will thank yourself when you find someone who loves you for you, and not who you pretend to be.

Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.Steel my heart · Interpol’s Paul Banks (right) and Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA (left) started their collaborative project back in 2013. The 12-track album features five singles, such as “Love and War” and “Speedway Sonora.”
Rap and rock mashups have taken the music world by storm several times over, but Banks & Steelz still find a way to stand out in their upcoming album Anything But Words set for release on Friday. 
No one could help but smirk when they first heard “Yeezer,” an Ohio State University student’s mashup of famous Kanye West and Weezer songs. Similarly, when Wiz Khalifa fired off “Joint in my hand, rocking jewels / My job, I do it too well” on the remix of Fall Out Boy’s “Uma Thurman,” people also raised eyebrows. In the landscape of rap and rock combos, the pair effortlessly blend their different styles into one singular genre. The duo is made up of Paul Banks, lead singer of beloved post-punk revival group Interpol, and RZA, hip-hop icon and founding member of Wu-Tang Clan. 
It’s surprising to hear such hunger and passion behind Banks & Steelz sound. The pair play with the eagerness of new musicians despite each having beyond 20 years of experience. They create a stand-out style with their album.
“Giant,” one of the duo’s the most popular singles, also serves as a description of their potential as artists. The upbeat festival feel in their music is matched with a precise and clean sound seemingly influenced by early 2000’s British grime music. RZA spits emotion to play off Banks’ raw vocals. Like most rap and rock collaborations, “Giant” takes the rap for verses and the rock for a gritty sound and the chorus vocals. As more tracks are released, one can hope that the duo play around with the collaboration formatting to stand out even further.
Their first single off the album is “Love + War (feat. Ghostface Killah).” The song begins like a New Orleans-influenced funeral march only to find itself as an indie-rock, Latin-influenced track. Banks, again, contributes his gentle, growling vocals. Horns softly cry to a smooth, continuous flow. The only variation is provided by the different tempos of Ghostface Killah and RZA’s verses.
Their most recent single, “Anything But Words,” starts out with lullaby-like melody accompanied by Banks’ vocals. In this song, Banks’ voice returns to the sound it has become known for, the one heard in every Interpol track. The percussion fluctuates between a slow beat to an undemanding drum roll that echoes throughout the entire song. This single lends itself closer to Banks’ musical background. It forgoes the peppier feel of “Giant” and the soulful vibe of “Love + War” for a darker, heavier experience.
Banks & Steelz mark an important moment in the musical shift toward combining genres, similar to when Phantogram and Big Boi combined for Big Grams. The two represent the mentality that genres are descriptors not definitions and that music will become a more fluid art. 
To catch them live, the band will be performing at the FYF Fest at Exposition Park on Sunday.

In the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, policymakers began to view higher education more as a private good than a public good, meaning that universities benefited individual students more than the nation at large. In previous decades, public universities enjoyed robust support from state and federal government and tuition at some of the country’s best universities was free or nearly free — in fact, UCLA did not charge California residents tuition until 1967. With the fierce competition for prestige, desire for continual improvements and heightened need to attract an increasing number of students, universities began to resemble businesses more than nonprofit institutions. 
 The trend toward universities functioning on business models has permeated various facets of higher education, and the movement has begun to negatively affect primary and secondary education as well. Public school districts have been recently pressured to eliminate employee protection programs like teacher tenure and wrongly emphasize accountability systems that force teachers to ensure their students annually pass a state exam — even though these tactics can have a profoundly negative impact on both students and staff. Though it remains clear that education reform is necessary, the movement toward a business model is certainly not the direction in which public schools should move. 
 As enrollment declines in Los Angeles public primary and secondary schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District has taken a cue straight from the universities themselves by using similar marketing tactics to attract prospective students. To combat the increased competition from charter, private and parochial schools for an increasingly limited number of students, LAUSD hired a marketing director last December. As part of their strategy, LAUSD plans to launch a website this week with resources, such as brochures and handouts, available for principals to utilize at their schools. Other proposed strategies include eliminating the teacher tenure system and creating performance-based accountability through high-stakes testing —  negatively pushing traditional public schools toward operating on business models, beneficial for neither staff nor students. Studies have not been able to demonstrate conclusively that such a system is the most effective in increasing student achievement. Schools should not measure teachers based on how students perform on exams, as that causes teachers to emphasize teaching directly to the state accountability exam and thereby ignore long-term goals. 
Contrary to traditional public schools, charter schools began at the outset with a business model. The argument in favor of having schools operate strategically is that they can facilitate a shift toward a performance-based system and provide competition within the public school system, ultimately creating a higher quality educational environment. The idea is that charter schools are better able to hold schools accountable for meeting measurable pupil outcomes by implementing a performance-based accountability system.                                                  
However, studies have not been able to conclusively demonstrate that such a system is the most effective in increasing student achievement. On average, public schools that do not use businesslike tactics often perform at least as well or better than the average charter school in a comparable district. Despite the facts, this trend led to the “high-stakes testing” found in schools today, where teachers’ performances are based on how well students perform on exams — neither proven to increase student proficiency, nor quality of staff. The trend in the later part of the 20th century in higher education of universities functioning more like businesses has had an impact on the way public schools operate nowadays. 
The question whether traditional schools should operate in such a way, given an increase in competition for enrollment due to a movement toward alternative schools like charter schools, still remains to be seen. What is clear is that traditional public schools have had to evaluate some of their practices, namely the teacher tenure system and performance-based accountability system, to keep up with an ever-changing atmosphere. However, public schools should not eliminate the employee practices that reward effective teachers by granting them tenure. Make no mistake: Public school systems should not consider adopting an accountability system that rewards teachers more for students passing a state exam than learning actual material.

The University of Kentucky is currently taking its student newspaper to court for requesting documents relating to a case of alleged sexual assault on the part of a faculty member. James Harwood, an associate professor at the university, resigned approximately two months after he was charged with the offense. The Kentucky Kernel, an independent student newspaper, received anonymous information about the incident and subsequently filed a public records request with the university. The full investigation was not released — only the settlement documents in which Harwood cited “family medical reasons” as the cause of his resignation. The school refused to release other documents following pressure from the Kernel, and chose instead to “pursue a resolution to these respectful differences of opinion in a court of law.” 
The free, independent press has always been a vessel used to protect the interests of community members. Students sought out the newspaper with a plea to hold the university accountable. The university’s refusal to release the documents of the full investigation in the name of privacy is not only illegal, but also interferes with its own campus newspaper’s duty to report on the full truth. 
The university’s actions were unacceptable. The utmost priority of any educational institution should be the safety and well-being of their students. Their failure to conduct a proper investigation of Harwood endangered the entire student body. Furthermore, their condemnation of the campus newspaper further hinders the protection of their students. It does not allow for free and healthy circulation of opinions and ideas, nor the necessary advocacy on behalf of vulnerable members of the community. As the flagship university in Kentucky, it is extremely disappointing that the school was unable to provide their students with the support they needed, and adding insult to injury, hindered other community members from supporting them. 
The university claims that they face “the need to protect the privacy and dignity of individual members of our community.” From this very statement, it is evident that the university had placed its tenured faculty member’s reputation before the safety and dignity of their two female students. 
The issue of university reputation overriding student safety and the search for truth has emerged on several college campuses across the country. At the University of California, Davis, the chancellor was found to have paid tens of thousands of dollars to remove any reference to violence against student protesters on campus.  Stanford University has recently come under fire for mishandling sexual assault cases on their campus. In most cases, the press organizations on campus are critical in safeguarding student interests and maintaining transparency. College newspapers have historically been centers of activism and truth, and community members look to student journalists to advocate for their rights. 
The university portrays this choice as a difficult one, when there really is no choice at all. It is strikingly clear that the university’s reputation was given priority over the students it claims to serve. 
The press’ impact has already been made clear in this case. The Kernel’s involvement in this case ensured that Harwood’s name will be circulated and his history of sexual assault publicized. Moreover, the leaked documents clearly illustrated the facts of the case, therefore revealing the university’s corrupt agenda, allowing the public to understand the extent to which universities try to protect their reputation. Denying access to these documents only exacerbated the consequences for the university, and as long as campus newspapers exist and operate ethically, the search for truth and justice will never be over.

Over the past twenty years, the Silicon Valley tech boom has laid out the foundations for technologies like iPhones, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and many other internet-enabled services that are now a part of daily life for many Americans. Unfortunately, today’s smartphones have fewer groundbreaking features, sales are beginning to slow, and venture capital cash for conventional startups is drying up.
The mainstream market seems to be slumping, yet a thirst for exciting advances in technology is still apparent. A new field called “frontier tech” has emerged, and it aims to create the next big leaps that will change our lives, instead of simply incrementing slowly on existing tech. While Stanford may still be the de-facto leader for tech innovation hubs on the West Coast, USC has slowly crept into the conversation due to the school’s many courses, research projects, labs, and startups that are leading the way in emerging technologies.
VR/AR – Mixed Reality
With several laboratories advancing frontier research at USC, the university may be the leader in mixed reality research. Many significant developments in virtual reality (VR) were created at USC’s Institute of Creative Technologies and MxR Laboratory. Under Director Mark Bolas, researchers have worked on applications of life-like simulations, such as treating veterans with PTSD. Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, also did his research at the MxR Lab before starting his famous VR company, which is now owned by Facebook. Additionally, Professor Mike Zyda’s Advanced Games program at the GamePipe Laboratory works on developing serious games, like the VR memory-enhancement tool Recall.
VR journalism is not forgotten at USC as Professor Robert Hernandez leads a VR-focused communications class and employs resources provided by the new Annenberg Digital Lounge. Nony De La Pena, the leading voice in VR journalism and the author of Project Syria, is a research fellow at the USC Annenberg School of Journalism and has shown her work at the DAVOS Economic Forum.
Many people consider Augmented Reality (AR) to have even more global potential than VR and has been on display in movies like Minority Report thanks to the work done by Professor Alex McDowell, who is also the director of the USC World Building Media Lab. 
Additionally, students at the USC Iovine and Young Academy are currently working on new AR projects, and the school recently sent out immersive acceptance letters to new students. 
Transportation & Infrastructure
USC’s world-class engineers in the fields of transportation and infrastructure also contribute to frontier tech. The USC Hyperloop team designed pods to be used in Elon Musk’s futuristic tube-based transportation system and competed against schools like MIT in Texas.
Autonomous cars may be associated with Google’s home up in Mountain View, but USC Professor Jeffrey Miller is regarded as an expert in autonomous vehicle ethics. The computer science professor has been published in IEEE and interviewed in The Verge as his research is used to write the laws and study the consequences of self-driving cars. 
USC’s advanced rocket propulsion programs and its extra-curricular rocket club have made the school one of the principal recruiting destinations for space companies like SpaceX and JPL. 
To address our growing energy needs, USC SmartGrid formed as a joint project with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and aims to optimize power grid infrastructure to be sustainable.
It’s clear that USC is at the forefront of developing many of tomorrow’s technologies and students should take advantage of the opportunity to get involved in these projects. While Silicon Valley may be held up as the center of today’s innovation, USC is firmly positioned to lead as we transition into the next frontier.
