The USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies celebrated its 20th anniversary at the Los Angeles Yacht Club in San Pedro last week.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Wrigley Institute as well as the 50th anniversary of the Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island. The Wrigley Institute was founded in 1995 and is a forum for marine and environmental research. Robert Woolley, director of development at the Wrigley Institute, said the institute would not exist today without the Wrigley family’s generosity.
“The institute itself came out of the Wrigley family’s dedication to environmental awareness and environmental issues, particularly around water issues, that needed addressing,” Woolley said. “I view myself as a steward of their gift and their involvement, and it’s a thrill for me to work for them in that capacity and what was set out 20 years ago by doing what I do.”
The event, which was held on Thursday evening, featured a panel with Wrigley Institute Inaugural Director Dr. Tony Michaels as well as the fourth and current director Roberta Marinelli, who took over in July of 2011. Michaels said that the institute’s current goals are to promote environmental research.
“The institute’s goal is to be a source of environmental information, which includes support of basic research both in the natural sciences but also reaching more broadly into the social sciences,” Michaels said. “To be an effective communicator of that research to both scientists, policy makers, and the broader maker so that wise decisions regarding environmental problems can be made.”
The Wrigley Institute conducts extensive research to solve today’s environmental problems. For example, a few of their current projects include testing the use of bacterial metabolism in microbial fuel cells as an energy source to break down human and industrial waste without the pollution and contamination that are biproducts of most widely used energy sources.
Woolley said the ability of the institute and the marine science center to study the large variety of climates in Los Angeles County sets them apart from similar organizations in other locations.
“When you look at the institute itself, we have a footprint here on campus, we have a footprint down in the harbor with the Southern California Marine Institute, and then we have the marine lab on Catalina which is adjacent to preserved land stewarded by the Catalina Island Conservancy, and then the Big Fisherman’s Cove is a marine protected area,” Michaels said. “We’re the only institute that can take advantage of this dramatic change of environments within a 22-mile stretch.”
Marinelli stressed that she hopes the event would help raise awareness of the interconnectivity of our actions and how the things that we do might have environmental side effects that we do not consider.
“I think we all think about things like, ‘If I let my tap run water goes down the drain,’ but we don’t necessarily think about what that means for all of the other things that we think we should have in order to live,” Marinelli said. “So recognizing that interconnectivity and understanding the real imperative to reimagine how we do things is the message that we need to put forward.”
Woolley said that he hopes the event helps raise the profile of the institute among students at the university.
Woolley said that the Wrigley Institute has been successful in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation and that the institute actively seeks students of business and philosophy and other fields in order to objectively look at the research from multiple perspectives, not just a scientific one.
“We’re still a best-kept secret of the university. We have a number of students who actually go and study on the island each spring, and that’s an opportunity that I think not many students know,” Woolley said. “It involves not just the sciences, but the people who interpret the sciences and who are going to implement the policies that are interpreted from those sciences.”

In light of the recent protests regarding low wages at USC, Smiles Café at the USC Caruso Catholic Center intends to employ workers in the upcoming fall semester with an average base hourly wage of $15.
Smiles Café, which opened in September 2014, is a student-owned coffee shop and eatery that serves a variety of coffee, tea, salads, paninis and healthy snacks. This eatery has partnered with many student organizations, including Troy Camp, Helenes and Kicks for Kids.
Jesse Rubio, owner of Smiles Café, said the monetary increase would come from the business itself.
“We are a small business, but I want to prove and show President Nikias that if a small business can pay their employees $15, then USC and their affiliates can increase wages for low-paid employees,” Rubio said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
In addition to raising the employees’ wages, Smiles Café will also provide all USC staff employees who receive minimum wage a free cup of coffee per day until there is a facilitated conversation regarding wages.
“As CEO and a USC student, I believe the issue of low wages is not a conversation about the minimum wage, but rather a conversation about human dignity,” Rubio wrote in the email. “USC workers, whether teachers or facility workers, do not deserve a minimum wage hourly rate. They deserve what they give to us with their services.”
Rubio, a junior majoring in international relations (global business), said his business is centered around making his guests, who his competitors call customers, happy. He has invited students from Thornton School of Music to play jazz music every week at Smiles Café while hosting two art shows per semester featuring work by USC fine arts students.
Smiles Café also donates and fundraises for USC philanthropic organizations.
“Smiles Café also takes pride in being the most socially responsible business at USC,” Rubio said. “We have donated and fundraised for the largest USC student-led organizations on campus. We have raised thousands of dollars to give back to the philanthropic missions of USC’s amazing student organizations.”
The demonstration, called Fight for $15 on 4/15, held last Wednesday was part of a national effort organized by the coalition Raise the Wage LA. The demonstration began in downtown Los Angeles, and the workers made their way to Figueroa Street and 28th Street. The event ended with a march to University Park campus and a chant at Tommy Trojan around 1 p.m.
“USC employees deserve a just wage that reflects the hard work they do and the service they provide. They are part of the Trojan family, and like family, we have to make sure their needs are met,” Rubio said.
“We are a small business, but I want to prove and show President Nikias that if a small business can pay their employees $15, then USC and their affiliates can increase wages for low-paid employees,” Rubio said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
-We’ll see how long you can maintain that…until you go out of business.

It was a rough Saturday in Westwood for the USC women’s water polo team, as the No. 3 Women of Troy couldn’t find their scoring touch and fell to No. 2 UCLA by a score of 9-5 in both teams’ regular-season finale.
Like most matches between these two crosstown rivals, the energy and atmosphere was unlike any normal regular-season game.
Not only were there bragging rights on the line, but it was also UCLA’s Senior Day, and Bruin fans came out in full force to pack Spieker Aquatics Center. The Women of Troy (21-3, 4-2 MPSF) were ready to play spoiler in Westwood, but the excitement of the game was soon gone after the Bruins (21-2, 5-1 MPSF) scored the first goal of the game and held onto that lead for the rest of the afternoon.
Scoring woes and missed opportunities for USC, plus timely goals by the Bruins, would ultimately cost the Women of Troy the game, as they fell into an early deficit by halftime and were never able to fully recover.
The five goals scored against the Bruins were USC’s second lowest scoring output this season, the lowest being the 5-3 loss to UCLA at the UC Irvine Invitational back in February. Scoring typically hasn’t been a problem for the Women of Troy this season though, as USC leads the MPSF in offense with 17.57 goals per game while also managing to outscore opponents by a whopping 409-111 margin.
Head coach Jovan Vavic notes that his team could be deadly when they are clicking on offense, but against UCLA, that scoring prowess was fleeting.
“We have been very, very good scoring-wise against a very good defensive team like [No. 1-ranked] Stanford where we scored nine goals in regulation, and against any other opponent, we have been in double digits,” Vavic said. “Cal kept us at less than 10 goals and UCLA too, but against every other opponent, we’ve scored 10 goals or more. We know we can be the most dangerous team in the country.”
USC, however, just couldn’t find the back of the net on Saturday, scoring just one goal in the first frame, none in the second, three in the third and just one in the fourth.
From the start, the Bruins came out of the gates hot, as UCLA’s Kodi Hill scored 33 seconds into the game. Four minutes later, a 6-on-5 goal by Alys Williams pushed the Bruin lead to 2-0 before senior driver Monica Vavic notched goal of her own to end the first frame with a 2-1 score in favor of the Bruins.
UCLA would then add two more goals in the second frame while blanking USC, taking a 4-1 lead into halftime.
The Women of Troy would make it interesting in the third frame, as freshman utility Hayley McKelvey scored once, and Vavic added another 6-on-5 goal to cut the deficit to one. Just as the Women of Troy came close, however, another goal was on the board for UCLA, and the Bruins held the score to 5-4 going into the final frame.
Despite the comeback efforts by the Women of Troy, the fourth period was ultimately all about UCLA, as they would outscore USC by a 4-1 margin.
A goal by Mackenzie Barr and another by Hill in the opening minutes pushed the Bruin lead back up to three before Vavic converted a five-meter penalty shot that was earned thanks to junior                           two-meter player Jayde Appel with two minutes left on the clock. But that was the closest USC would get, as UCLA would manage to score two more goals before the whistle blew to end the game with a 9-5 win.
UCLA was led by attacker Rachel Fattal, who scored four of her team’s nine goals, and goalie Sami Hall, who recorded eight saves on the day. The Women of Troy were led offensively by Vavic’s three goals, while McKelvey and sophomore driver Stephania Haralabidis added one goal apiece. Freshman goalie Victória Chamorro was once again steady in the cage for USC, tallying 11 saves on the day. Chamorro deflected a number of 6-on-5 scoring opportunities and five-meter shots for the Bruins throughout the game, but ultimately, the high-powered UCLA offense was too much for the Women of Troy to handle.
The lone bright spots for USC on Saturday were the performances by Chamorro and Vavic.
The Brazilian goalie’s 11 big saves in the cage was good enough for game-high honors, while the All-American first-team driver Vavic moved up the ranks in MPSF history for career goals scored.
Her 88 goals on the year is already second-most ever in a single season at USC, while her hat trick against the Bruins upped her total to 279 career goals, giving her sole possession of No. 2 all-time in MPSF scoring history.
With anywhere between two and six games left in the season depending on conference and NCAA tournament results, Vavic needs just eight more goals to surpass current record-holder Molly Smith of Pacific, who recorded 286 career goals between 1997-2000.
Despite the loss, Vavic still thinks his team can make a strong push when they head into the MPSF Tournament next weekend.
“Our team still has better chemistry this year compared to last year, I think. Winning a close game against Cal, and also being down to Stanford at home by three goals and then coming back to tie that game, those are the signs of a team that doesn’t quit,” Vavic said.
USC must now prepare for the upcoming MPSF Championships this weekend in Tempe, Arizona, where the Women of Troy have earned the No. 3 seed. USC will face off against No. 6 San Jose State Friday at 12:30 p.m. MST.

College football is great for so many reasons. Chief among them is the development of young, talented recruits into important contributors to the team by the time these players leave campus.
Of course, it’s hard to peg which players will materialize and which ones will go the way of Whitney Lewis, Blake Ayles and Dillon Baxter: all-world high school recruits who just could not excel at the collegiate level.
Part of the excitement is watching an unheralded recruit, such as Clay Matthews, who originally walked on to the football team, develop into All-American candidates. Equally exciting is when a top recruit such as Keith Rivers, Matt Kalil, or more recently, Leonard Williams and Su’a Cravens, exceed the hype and turn in some of the most storied and accomplished collegiate careers in Trojan history.
It’s not always easy to predict the trajectory of incoming freshmen.
Naturally, talent plays a major role, but coach and player development is equally important. Additionally, other factors such as work ethic, discipline, eating habits, and football IQ, which play a significant role in whether or not a player will realize their full potential.
As a fan, it’s exciting to identify underclassmen as future stars and watch as their careers unfold. It adds an extra level of investment to the games especially in the last couple of years when the Trojans weren’t competiting for national titles.
Over the last 10 years, I have fervently devoured every recruiting report before the new freshmen class steps onto campus and have tried to peg which players will be future    All-Americans.
There have been some quality predictions like Taylor Mays, who was listed as a 6-foot-4 safety who could run a 4.3        40-yard dash.
To be fair, It didn’t exactly take a rocket scientist to figure out that Pete Carroll and his legendary prowess in developing secondaries would take those raw talents and really refine them. The same could be said more recently about JuJu Smith and Tyron Smith.
Identifying highly coveted prospects as potential stars doesn’t require a high degree of skill, however figuring out which of the less ballyhooed recruits will make an impact is much more interesting and entertaining.
Over the last decade, there were guys like Fred Davis from Ohio who came in as a receiver but was too big and slow to make an impact and Morgan Breslin, who was just a little too small to become a dominant defensive end.
All Davis needed was a position change to tight end to win the Mackey award, and Breslin’s tenacity more than made up for his undersized frame.
These types of players, who flew under the radar in comparison to guys like Dwayne Jarrett and Nick Perry, are what makes college football so exciting. It’s not as if anyone USC recruits is unheralded, but there are different levels of expectations for different tiers of the recruiting class.
The last few years have brought in players who I thought would excel, but the jury is still out on a few of them.
Two of these Trojans, Steven Mitchell and Ajene Harris, had a promising spring. Another player who has had an underwhelming career thus far at USC, Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick, has a chance to have a great season at a thin tight end position.
This new full recruiting class brings in a ton of talent, with the best line backing group since Brian Cushing and Rey Maualuga were recruited. One doesn’t need to be Tom Lemming to realize that Osa Masina and Porter Gustin will be future stars.
There are some other guys though, who haven’t received as much attention who I think will have phenomenal careers as Trojans.
The first is Sam Darnold, the second quarterback in this year’s recruiting class. Though Ricky Town is the lauded recruit coach Steve Sarkisian was able to pry from Alabama, Darnold has the skill set that better fits Sarkisian’s up tempo offense. Much like how Cody Kessler beat out Max Wittek, I believe the same will happen down the road for Darnold and Town.
Darnold has the scrambling ability that no Trojan quarterback since Rodney Peete and Reggie Perry have possessed. Additionally Darnold is almost 6-foot-4 with a fairly strong arm, which is always an added plus as a quarterback.
The second is Dominic Davis, another local recruit, who is one of three running backs in this class. Though not as highly ranked as fellow tailback Ronald Jones, Davis is lighting quick with an exceptional burst. He has a slight frame, but will be a threat to score every time he touches the ball.
The elite explosiveness he displayed is a rare commodity in college football. Though it might be premature to draw comparisons, Jahvid Best, the former tailback at Cal, has a similar build and skill set.
There will certainly be other surprises from this year’s recruiting class, and hopefully it is the one that puts USC back on track to compete for national titles.
It won’t be a surprise to me if Darnold and Davis play a pivotal role down the road in helping lead the Trojans back to their glory days.

On April 7, Sen. Rand Paul announced his run for presidency. As soon as he declared his candidacy, The Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, a neoconservative nonprofit, revealed that they will launch an advertisement attacking Paul on his foreign policy views. The advertisement accuses Paul of supporting President Barack Obama’s negotiations with Iran and of “[standing] against sanctions that would hold the regime accountable.” The group has been running the advertisement in key early primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire.
This smear campaign is misguided for two reasons: first, it is mistaken about Paul’s views on Iran. Second, it feeds into the hawkish mania that seems to dominate mainstream foreign policy thinking in favor of the Republican Party. The GOP, if it wishes to be a true contender in 2016, would be wise to curb its neoconservative rhetoric in favor of Paul’s more sensible approach.
Paul’s father, Ron Paul, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012, but Ron never made it past the primaries, largely due to his stance on foreign policy. He was strongly anti-war, favoring a strict non-interventionist ideology. During one of the debates, Ron argued that from the Iranian perspective, nuclear development is rational, given America’s hostile relationship with Iran’s neighbors.
This view earned Ron some backlash and ultimately cost him the Republican candidacy. Rand Paul is not his father, though his viewpoints have the same libertarian foundation as his father’s. When it comes to Iran, Paul differs from his father greatly. Despite what the advertisement claimed, Paul has consistently voted in favor of sanctions against Iran. He was also one of the 47 Republican senators to sign the letter advising Iran’s leaders to hold off on negotiations with Obama until the Senate approves a deal. Clearly, the claim that Paul stands with Obama on Iran is baseless.
The only piece of evidence the advertisement uses in support of their anti-Paul argument is an audio clip of Paul saying that Iran is “not a threat to our national security.” This clip is from eight years ago, before Paul even entered in the U.S. Senate. His views have evolved with the issue. Whether he flip-flopped to appease his party or whether his views are sincere is of little relevance — the Paul that is running for president clearly approaches the Iran nuclear issue differently than Obama does.
But this Republican organization’s unfounded accusations are revelatory of a deeper problem the GOP needs to confront. Ronald Reagan and later George W. Bush ushered in a new era of conservative foreign policy, one that supports excessive foreign intervention and unauthorized preemptive wars. Paul strays from his party’s platform on this topic, but in a way that will benefit him in a national election against Hillary Clinton, the presumed future Democratic candidate.
Paul supports maintaining a robust, nimble military (though he doesn’t necessarily support drastic defense spending hikes, as some of his Republican opponents do). But he also emphasizes a cautious and constitutional approach to foreign intervention. He recognizes that a president cannot make the decision to bomb and invade another country on his or her own — he or she must first gain Congressional support. This is basic Constitutional law.
Paul also stresses that the government must have a better understanding of the consequences of foreign intervention. He is one of the only Republicans (or government officials for that matter) who is willing to admit that when the United States armed Syrian rebels, it strengthened ISIS, which is now arguably the largest threat to our national defense. He wants the government to understand that when it topples or weakens a secular regime in the Middle East, it creates a vacuum that is almost always filled by radical Islam.
Paul’s foreign policy is not weak, nor is it isolationist. It is, however, sensible at a time when many Americans still feel war-weary. The Republicans should be able to reconcile with his views, and adopt them into the mainstream party platform. Lying about his stance because it is a perceived threat to the party establishment will set them up for another loss in 2016.
The old-guard Republicans will soon learn the consequences of rejecting Paul’s ideas.
I think that the party will begin to change when the older generation dies out. They’re the node of the big-government Republicans.
I agree with your point except that (as one of the “older generation”) I don’t want to die out before we change the way politics works in America. Both of the entrenched parties are becoming Neocons in suits and we need the next generation, plus at least me, to try to change the way we elect our leaders. By that I’m not talking about direct election or banning contributions to candidates or even term limits. I mean we have to begin to THINK about our votes and the people we would vote for. We need healthy skepticism of advertisements we see because sometimes we learn more about a candidate by looking at who is backing or bashing him(or her).
All true…

After an impressive showing on Friday followed by a tough loss on Saturday against the Oregon Ducks (23-17, 5-9 in Pac-12) , the No. 10 Trojans (28-10, 9-5 in Pac-12) bounced back with a 7-3  win on Sunday to claim the weekend series at Dedeaux Field.
USC started the weekend strong on Friday defeating Oregon 13-6 thanks to an offensive explosion started off by senior Timmy Robinson’s first career grand slam in the bottom of the fourth inning.
The Trojans dug themselves into a hole during the first inning as the Ducks scored four runs on two hits, taking advantage of a fielding error. USC then immediately struck back in the bottom of the first with hits by senior Garrett Stubbs, Robinson and junior Blake Lacey to tally three runs followed by two Ducks’ fielding errors.
After starting pitcher junior Brent Wheatley and junior reliever Tyler Gilbert combined to prevent further damage by Oregon, USC broke the game open. The Trojans took advantage of a lack of pitch control from starter Cole Irvin, who walked Stubbs to bring the game-tying run to the plate with the bases loaded. Robinson then delivered the 1-1 pitch into left field for the grand slam, putting the Trojans up 8-4.
The Ducks attempted a comeback in the top of the seventh, but the Trojans answered with five more runs during the bottom of the inning to secure the final score of 13-5. Four different Trojans had multi-hit outings, including Robinson, who tied his career-high five RBIs set in 2013 against Utah.
Unfortunately, the momentum swung back in Oregon’s favor in a major way on Saturday as the Trojans once again fell into an early deficit but this time were unable to force a comeback.
Junior starter Kyle Twomey (6-2, 2.05 ERA) had a very uncharacteristically rough start, only going an inning and two-thirds and allowing seven runs on five hits, walking two and striking out three during the top of the second inning. He struggled with pitch control and placement as well, hitting three batters.
An error on a poor throw to second on what would have been a routine double play ended up costing the Trojans four of these runs. Reliever junior Bernardo Flores (3-1, 3.15 ERA) entered the game with two outs and a man on second to record the final out to finally end the inning.
After the Ducks managed more runs in the top of the third and sixth to put them up 9-0, USC got on the board during the bottom of the sixth. Redshirt junior Bobby Stahel extended his team-high hitting streak to 20 games before scoring on a single by Stubbs. An error by the right fielder allowed Stubbs to eventually steal third and then score from a single by sophomore Jeremy Martinez, making it 9-2.
The Trojans added two more runs in the bottom of the seventh and eighth. During the seventh, Ramirez led off the inning with a double, stole third and then came home on a rocket hit by red shirted senior Angelo La Bruna that nailed starter David Peterson in the shin, ending his day on the mound. The final Trojan run was scored by freshman pinch hitter Adalberto Carrillo who drove home sophomore Joe Corrigan.
Looking at the game as a whole, USC head coach Dan Hubbs believes that the core of his team’s current problems stem from pitching.
“I don’t think we’ve pitched very well at home in conference and we pitch better on the road, which is uncharacteristic,” Hubbs said. “So we need to iron some things out so if we have to do some flipping around of roles we will. I thought offensively  we’re playing pretty well and defensively we’re playing pretty well. We’ve just got to iron out the pitching in my opinion.”
Bernardo Flores feels that clean pitching from himself and the other relievers remain key for the Trojans.
“I think the biggest thing we have to do is bear down and throw strikes right away,” Flores said. “We had a lot of hit by pitches and walks, so I think one thing we really have to concentrate on is throwing strikes. We have to learn from out mistakes and move on. I think if we can do that we’ll be more consistent with the way we play.”
Though learning from mistakes remains key, Flores also believes that it’s important for the Trojans not to dwell on the past.
“We need to flush [Saturday] out and not worry about it, not look back at it and move forward,” Flores said. “We need to learn from it and move forward and come back ready to win. Coach Hubbs talks about having energy a lot while in the dugout. The energy determines how we do on the mound on the field and at bat.”
Looking ahead, the Trojans will next travel to Oregon State with no mid-week game scheduled, allowing ample time for USC to come out ready for victory.
“One nice thing about a game like this weekend not being so gut-wrenchingly close is that you have time to think about the next game, and concentrate on how to win more Pac series, which is obviously key for                                      post-season,” Hubbs said. “We’ve got to concentrate and take each series as they come and start to iron out the issues necessary to win.”

This season, consistency has been the name of the game for the No. 1-ranked USC sand volleyball team. From top to bottom, all five Women of Troy pairs have produced quality wins in a steady fashion, and it was no different this weekend at the 2015 Pac-12 Invitational in Santa Monica. After beating Arizona State by a 4-1 score and sweeping No. 10-ranked Arizona 5-0 twice, the Women of Troy (24-0) claimed their second consecutive Pac-12 Invitational title and remained perfect on the season.
In total, USC dropped just three sets over the course of the day, while their two 5-0 sweeps of Arizona upped their total to 16 sweeps on the year. Some milestones were met on the day as well, as the sophomore tandem of Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler won all three of their matches and recorded their 25th win, making them the fourth USC pair to do so this season. Furthermore, the No. 5 pair pair of senior Bria Russ and freshman Jenna Belton also won all three of their matches on Saturday and are now just one win away from also reaching that 25-win plateau. Russ herself finished the regular season with a perfect 24-0 mark in duals.
USC welcomed four other up-and-coming conference teams to the Pac-12 Invitational this weekend, including No. 8 UCLA (9-4), No. 10 Arizona (15-3), Arizona State (6-11) and California (7-12). USC would start off against the winner of the “play-in” game between the No. 4-seed Arizona State Sun Devils and the No. 5-seed California Golden Bears. ASU prevailed in the earliest match of the day, pitting them against USC in the first round of the tournament. On the bottom of the bracket,  No. 2-seed UCLA would face off against No. 3-seed Arizona, where the Wildcats came out victorious.
In the first round of the double-elimination style bracket, the No. 1-seed Women of Troy started the morning off against the No. 4-seed Arizona State Sun Devils. USC struck first and got wins from their four and five pairs, as Belton and Russ at the five spot delivered an easy 21-5, 21-7 win over ASU’s Frances Giedraitis and Kwyn Johnson. Then, Martin and Wheeler at the four spot notched a 21-7, 21-13 win over Mia Rivera and McKenzie Willey. The sophomore pair of Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes would clinch the dual match over on court one, handing Bianca Arellano and Macey Gardner a 21-12, 21-11 defeat. The No. 3 pair of seniors Eve Ettinger and Meg Norton added a fourth point to the team total with a 21-9, 21-19 beating of Whitney Follette and Halle Harker, while the last pair to finish was USC’s No. 2 tandem of junior Alexa Strange and sophomore Sophie Bukovec. ASU’s Jordy Checkal and Bethany Jorgensen squeaked out a close 25-23 win in the first set and rode that momentum into the second, handing Strange and Bukovec a rare 25-23, 21-17 loss on the day. Still, USC registered a 4-1 win against the Sun Devils and moved on to the semifinals of team play.
The Women of Troy would then face off against a ranked team in the No. 10 Arizona Wildcats. Belton and Russ would score USC’s first point at the five spot once again, recording a 21-10, 21-12 win over Arizona’s Hailey Devlin and Sarah Seiber. The next team to score a point would be the No. 1 pair of Claes and Hughes, who beat Arizona twins Madison Witt and McKenna Witt by an identical 21-14, 21-14 score. It would be the upperclassmen of USC that clinched the dual, as the No. 3 pair of Ettinger and Norton handed Emily Kiser and Rachel Rhoades a 21-8, 21-12 loss. Strange and Bukovec at the two spot would record their first win of the day with a 21-18, 21-17 win over Kaitlyn Leary and Kendall Polan, while Martin and Wheeler at the four spot completed the 5-0 sweep with a 21-12, 26-24 nail biter win over Arizona’s Taylor Arizobal and Allie Cook. The win over the Wildcats propelled USC into the title match, but the Women of Troy would have to wait to see who their next opponent would be.
The Arizona Wildcats had to face off against the ASU Sun Devils in the loser’s bracket in order to have a chance to advance to the finals and face USC. Ultimately, the Wildcats prevailed over the rival Sun Devils by a 3-2 score. An hour after the Women of Troy had beaten the Wildcats, the two teams would meet again in the championship match of the Pac-12 Invite. It would be déjà vu for the Women of Troy, as once again USC swept the Wildcats, 5-0. This time, USC got on the board first with a win on court three, as Ettinger and Norton handed Kiser and Rhoades a 21-5,       21-13 defeat. Belton and Russ at the five spot defeated Devlin and Seiber 23-21, 21-7, while the No. 1 pair of Claes and Hughes clinched the victory and the Pac-12 Invite crown with a 21-18, 21-14 win over the Witts. Bukovec and Strange handed Leary and Polan a 21-17, 21-19 loss on court two, and Martin and Wheeler clinched the sweep with an exciting three set win over Arizobal and Cook by a 21-16, 21-23, 15-11 score. By the end of the day, USC added three more wins to their total to remain perfect on the season, while handing No. 10-ranked Arizona just their second and third losses all year.
The Women of Troy are hoping to carry the momentum into the postseason when they head off to the AVCA Championships held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, in early May.

Last Thursday morning, there was a rumbling, the skies opened and a new Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer descended upon a mostly unsuspecting Internet. From the moment a swaggering Han Solo spoke the words, “Chewie, we’re home,” the reaction was near unanimous praise. The shockwaves were not as pronounced as when Lucasfilm released the first excellent glimpse into J.J. Abrams’s new vision for the galaxy far, far away last November, but it still took the Internet by storm.
It showed two minutes of entirely new footage while still concealing everything substantial about the story itself — unlike that other multi billion-dollar Disney property, Marvel, which with its extensive “sneak previews” and “extended looks,” has taken a slash-and-burn approach to any remaining mystery for the upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Force Awakens trailer aftermath was as if a million nerd voices suddenly cried out at once, dissecting the new footage shot by shot, frame by frame. Thursday was a triumph for Lucasfilm and a statement of just how deep the hunger flows for these big-budget blockbusters.
Lost in all the hoopla was Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.  The highly anticipated film also released its first trailer this weekend. That trailer’s release came with much less fanfare, due in large part to the fact that it was first leaked online as a shaky recording made from inside a movie theater — Portuguese subtitles included for added effect. This is not the first superhero movie leak we have had recently; the Age of Ultron teaser was famously leaked a week early. Marvel promptly adjusted and released the actual version. Warner Bros. did the same here. Maybe, if that had happened on any other weekend, it would not have mattered. But the Star Wars trailer doomed it to being utterly overshadowed. Since, the trailer was due to be released Monday, however, one could wonder whether Warner Bros. (or, for that matter, 20th Century Fox, whose first full, much more spoiler-addled, Fantastic Four trailer leaked Sunday morning ahead of its planned Monday release date) knew that the Star Wars announcement would be happening Thursday. This is not the first decision by Warner Bros. that calls into question the firm’s ability to build the massive DC cinematic universe that it has set its sights on.
By all accounts, due to its extensive and popular comic book universe, DC should be neck-and-neck with Marvel, movie-wise. Instead, it has largely been left in the dust. Aside from the highly successful Dark Knight trilogy, nothing with the DC stamp has come close to Marvel’s MCU juggernaut. Christopher Nolan crafted a gritty, fun series of movies, each more massive than the last. But Batman is a pop culture golden goose, meaning simply that making a successful film franchise around the single most popular superhero is not, relatively speaking, that difficult. In comparison, Marvel took the Guardians of the Galaxy, a comic book team with a Q-rating of essentially zero and made it the subject of the third highest grossing movie of 2014 — outperforming Man of Steel at the box office by a cool $106 million. It’s an often repeated line — thought one that merits emphasis — but this would have been unthinkable back in 2008 when Iron Man came out and the MCU was born. Now, simply having “Marvel” appear at the front of the movie causes people to flock to see largely unknown characters in films like Guardians. DC simply doesn’t have that kind of pull yet.
It is certainly trying, though. Back in October, DC announced its plans to create a cinematic universe to rival Marvel’s with 10 movies in the works.
That universe is now in the hands of Zack Snyder, who helmed Man of Steel, is currently working on the finishing touches of Dawn of Justice and is slated to direct two Justice League movies. Snyder, who is currently pegged to have DC movies directed by him come out in 2016, 2017 and 2019, is a fine director for a superhero movie. His work on 300 and Watchmen was loud, flashy and stylized. His Man of Steel, however, met extremely polarizing reviews.
Its dark tone didn’t jive with expectations for a Superman movie, and it only garnered a 55 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This, however, hasn’t stopped DC from making a darker, edgier tone its chosen defining characteristic to try and differentiate itself from Marvel’s generally lighter, good-guys-always-win house style. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, as the Man of Steel returns indicate that they will, at the very least, take some getting used to. Before we get to 2018’s dark and gritty Aquaman movie, DC needs to prove that its gritty-for-the-sake-of-being-gritty approach holds water.
The response to the Dawn of Justice trailer shows that this is not a sure thing yet. Those who did take a break from Star Wars to give their opinions on DC’s offered plenty of questions, but none of the unbridled excitement that Star Wars incited. The reaction mostly focused on two things: Batman’s suit looking like Lego Batman’s suit from The Lego Movie (it is in fact more reminiscent of Batman’s suit from the book with perhaps the most famous Superman-Batman showdown, Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns) and the caped crusader’s one line in the trailer, “Tell me, do you bleed? You will,” as simultaneously overly corny and dark. Batman and Superman are the two single most popular superheroes around, much more popular individually than any of Marvel’s heroes. And yet, the trailer barely created a ripple. Perhaps Star Wars is a different animal entirely, but the reaction to the Dawn of Justice teaser certainly does not seem solely due to a case of poor timing. While Disney revels in the afterglow of its latest trailer and hungrily counts down the days to Ultron’s release on May 1, Warner Bros. is struggling to get its own behemoth off the ground. If the reaction to the actual film, due to be released next April, is as tepid as the reaction to the first trailer, then DC’s patchwork Spruce Goose cinematic universy will be in danger of never getting off the ground — let alone catching up to Marvel’s already-soaring quinJet of a universe.

Excellent article.  The impulsiveness of deciding to make this their next film still shows , in poor green-screening & doornail dialogue.
My predicton : Alfred will be excellent & we’ll written , as will other secondary characters – but the basic shoehorned motivations for their fight wI’ll be hard to “Terrio” away.  =7
Cautiously optimistic.  Mostly cautious, based on snyder’s film record.

The Force awakened in Anaheim last weekend as an estimated 60,000 fans descended on the Anaheim Convention Center for the 10th annual Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event dedicated solely to those who take their milk blue and their nerf herders scruffy-looking.
The event kicked off in epic fashion with the premiere of a rapturously received trailer for this December’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the seventh installment in the saga of the Skywalkers and the first to be released following Disney’s acquisition of the beloved property back in 2012. Director J.J. Abrams and Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy were on hand to introduce the new footage, tease fans with tantalizing tidbits regarding planet names — turns out the desert shown in the trailer isn’t Tattooine but rather a brand new world called Jakku — and provide early glimpses of the film’s cast, including series vets Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), as well as a new trio of heroes played by ingénue Daisy Ridley, British up-and-comer John Boyega and Golden Globe nominee Oscar Isaac.
With the notable exception of Ford, who is still recovering from last month’s plane crash involving an emergency-landing on a Venice golf course, nearly all of the film’s stars joined Abrams and Kennedy on the Celebration Stage, flanked somewhat ominously by a garrison of sleekly redesigned stormtroopers. In addition to the warm reception from the faithful, some of whom had camped out the night before to ensure their seats, the actors were also surprised by two of their non-human cast mates: the plucky R2-D2 and the newly unveiled orange and white “ball droid” BB-8. Much to the crowd’s delight, the latter was revealed to be a working prop instead of the digital creation many assumed it was.
After heartfelt and nostalgia-tinged words from Hamill and the rest of the old guard, the younger stars each received an opportunity to speak about their time on the Force Awakens set while offering often cryptic information about their respective characters. Ridley, who has never before acted in a major film, mentioned that her character, Rey, first appears on Jakku, leading a life of what could be described as quiet desperation.
“She’s a scavenger in a ship graveyard and very self-sufficient, very solitary,” the 23-year-old actress said. “Until she meets another character and the adventure begins.”
Boyega, who rocketed to international prominence after starring as a charismatic South London street tough in Joe Cornish’s deliriously entertaining 2011 alien invasion flick Attack the Block, revealed that his character, Finn, is an Imperial stormtrooper who undergoes a crisis of conscience, an intriguing concept the previous six films never touched on.
“When we find Finn, he’s in incredible danger and he reacts to the changes in his life,” Boyega said. “And it launches him into the Star Wars universe.”
Isaac, a gifted performer who has received critical accolades for his turns as a struggling folk singer in the Coen brothers’ languorous dirge Inside Llewyn Davis and a morally besieged fuel supplier in J.C. Chandor’s anti-gangster movie A Most Violent Year, recalled celebrating in his hotel room after hearing he’d won the part of Poe Dameron, a seasoned X-Wing ace the actor describes as, “the best frickin’ pilot in the galaxy,” adding that Dameron will find himself on a mission from a certain princess with a fondness for hair buns.
The rest of the expo, which ran from Thursday to Sunday, included everything from a Lego X-Wing Shop and custom droid racing to a Princess Leia-centric fashion show and a Star Wars-themed tattoo contest, but the two biggest draws by far were the Force Awakens prop and costume gallery — the line to get in exceeded two hours at one point — and a series of panels hosted by voice actor James Arnold Taylor. Taylor, best known for playing Obi-Wan Kenobi for over six seasons on Cartoon Network’s The Clone Wars, used the interviews as a platform to promote his one-man show “Talking to Myself,” a journey through the tumultuous world of professional voice-over that involves him employing over 200 unique voices.
Taylor’s guests included Hamill, Fisher, Daniels and Ian McDiarmid, the stately British stage actor responsible for breathing foul life into the iconic arch-villain Emperor Palpatine, the Faustian Sith lord who brought an entire galaxy to its knees by transforming the courageous Anakin Skywalker into the tyrannical Darth Vader and the Old Republic into the First Galactic Empire. The highlight of the McDiarmid interview was undoubtedly the segment where Taylor asked his distinguished guest to read a passage in-character from William Shakespeare’s The Jedi Doth Return, the third installment of the immensely clever book series that re-imagines the Star Wars saga as Elizabethan stage plays written entirely in era-appropriate iambic pentameter. The result was riveting, hilarious and at times utterly terrifying. It’s also a perfect example of the type of inspired weirdness one can only find at fan conventions.

With ongoing global negotiations to address Iran’s nuclear capabilities, we’ve heard quite a bit lately about nuclear power’s capacity as a weapon. North Korea has also been the subject of much defense speculation, earning United Nations sanctions for test launches held in recent years. Amid all the talk about nuclear power’s menacing threat, it is important that we do not forget about its tremendous potential for high-quality energy production in a low-carbon society.
The 2011 generator meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan sparked an international wave of anti-nuclear sentiments that, in countries like the United States, has resulted in the decommissioning of many nuclear generators. Such decisions are troublesome. Though safety and waste disposal issues must be addressed, it is important that we not rule out this clean and efficient source of power as a substantial component of tomorrow’s energy mix.
Among the U.S. generating stations that have been taken offline in recent years is the Vermont Yankee plant along the Connecticut River, which permanently ceased operations in January. This closure came on the heels of closures at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in Southern California, which once provided electricity to 1.4 million homes, and the Crystal River plant in Florida. Utility companies have cited high maintenance and repair costs, made all the more extreme by booming competition from natural gas, as the impetus for these closures. But an active civil movement in opposition to nuclear power has also encouraged these shutdowns.
Opponents to nuclear have vocalized concerns over the dangerous radioactive waste that results from the nuclear fissioning process. Wastes have a half-life of many tens of thousands of years. Because most radioactive substances require 10 half-lives to achieve safe levels for human exposure, nuclear waste requires hundreds of thousands, even millions of years of storage and confinement. For years, federal regulators attempted to negotiate a plan to store the country’s nuclear wastes at a repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Immense objection by Nevadans, however, eventually collapsed the plan, and currently all nuclear waste is stored at the sites of its generation.
But a new frontier for nuclear energy is in the works. Laboratories around the country — usually situated in sparsely populated areas like Idaho Falls, Idaho — are working to perfect new reactor technologies that substantially reduce the amount of waste produced and use sodium, not water, as the primary coolant in power generation. New safety mechanisms are continuously evaluated and installed. In fact, in 2011 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimated that the chances of an earthquake in tremor-prone California damaging the reactor core of the now-defunct San Onofre power plant were one in 58,000. The construction of plants fitted with cutting-edge technologies could greatly diminish the already low chances of an accidental radioactive release.
Continued use of nuclear power will also diminish our reliance on the conventional fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Climate scientists are in nearly unanimous agreement on the human origin of current global warming. Because nuclear energy does not depend on the combustion of fossil fuels, it is a promising source of electricity as the global community seeks to minimize its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Computer modeling conducted by the British Meteorological Office concluded that the only course of action in achieving a manageable climate scenario — less than 2 degrees centigrade warming — demands the deployment of nuclear power.
Though nuclear power has historically polarized environmentalists, the remarkably low chance of a radiation leak cannot stand against the remarkably high promise of zero-carbon energy, especially at a time when our decisions about energy-use will be critical in determining the trajectory of man-made climate change.
Austin Reagan is a junior majoring in environmental studies and political science. His column, “The Scientific Method,” runs Mondays. 
1) In any discussion online about nuclear power, it is necessary for each of us in this discussion to state whether we have any financial connection with either the nuclear industry or the antinuclear community.  I have no such financial connection with either side.  2) Nuclear energy is clean?  Not so, based on a) the surprising amount of carbon released when the entire nuclear fuel cycle is considered, and b) math figures (trigonometry) from the writings of noted radiation chemist Theodore Rockwell, who worked alongside Admiral Rickover on nuclear power, that explain why 100% containment of ionizing radiation is not possible, and that therefore both fission and fusion reactors leak deadly ionizing radiation 24/7.  Nuclear power is therefore not clean power.  (Note: That Rockwell source is:  Creating the new world: stories & images from the dawn of the Atomic Age.)
Sodium cooled reactors are one kind of alternate form of nuclear power being explored.  So are lead cooled, gas cooled, and fluoride salt cooled reactors, liquid fuel reactors, and several kinds of fusion reactors.
Present nuclear reactors are an important part of the fight to limit the growth of coal and gas generation, but they aren’t cheap enough to halt their growth altogether, much less shrink them.  They also don’t compete with oil.  For that, we’ll need reactors cheap enough to make synthetic fuels cost competitive, and small and versatile enough to replace large ship engines.
Calculations of earthquake risk to a reactor depends on assumptions which we can’t directly assess.  If you look at everything that went wrong at Three Mile Island, the odds would have been astronomically against that particular combination of faults and failures.  But here’s a curious thing about odds.  If enough highly improbable events are possible, the odds of one of them happening can become probable.  That’s why a dart can hit the side of a barn, even though the odds were enormously against it hitting the exact spot that it did.
We can, however, say the odds of a liquid fuel reactor melting down is essentially zero under any circumstances.  Ditto for the odds of a pressure rupture in an ambient pressure reactor.  So while I would agree that present-day reactors have a relatively good safety record, I would also like to see them rendered obsolete and replaced with better reactors.  And the sooner the better.
Let’s apply Reagan’s summation of nuclear waste to another hazard: salt. “Salt has a half-life of forever. Because most chemical toxins require 10 half-lives to achieve safe levels for human exposure, salt requires ten-times-forever storage and confinement.”
And yet, there were saltshakers in the *Titanic* when it sank. Reagan’s rule would imply that we’ll never be clear of their threat (of losing containment and lethally salting the ocean).
Could it be that some consideration of the initial level is necessary, before applying the ten-half-lives rule? 
I think I would have used the example of bismuth 209–which we consume in Pepto Bismol without waiting even one half-life.
Producing nuclear energy heats the planet, kills marine life (in the case of using ocean water to cool nuke plants like at Diablo Canyon in California) and the radioactive waste can kill all life on earth. You seriously consider that “clean energy”?
You’re really into hyperbole, aren’t you? The radioactive decay of naturally occurring K-40 in the earth’s crust generates more heat than worldwide primary energy consumption. To expose all life on earth to the radioactive material in nuclear waste would require more power to aerosolize and disperse the material than is available from the radioactive decay.
Solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface averages 173,000
terawatts.  Total human global energy consumption currently averages
less than 20 terawatts.  Solar heating is a vastly larger effect than direct heating by human activities.
If nuclear is used to displace coal, every unit of waste heat from the reactor corresponds to more than 100 cooling units in the form of greenhouse gases not emitted.  What we really need is much hotter reactors.  The hotter they are, the more efficiently they can turn that heat into work.  Geothermal generators add more waste heat per unit of electricity than nuclear because they are colder and less efficient.
Don’t like spent fuel?  How about we burn it up in reactors that are specifically designed for that task?  Maybe we could also get rid of a few thousand warheads that way while we are at it.
Please review the energy budget of the atmosphere and compare the total energy from sunlight to the energy consumption of humans and never utter the first point again.
Clean only if you ignore the mining and reprocessing and nuclear waste.
All things (energy) require mining which is NO big deal compared to global warming caused by excess CO2.
