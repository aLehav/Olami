We are all members of the Trojan Family. We range in ages from 21 to 53. We represent the class of 1989 through the class of 2021. We have earned our degrees and built our careers in science, law, health care, business, media and nearly every other field of endeavor. We are black, white, Latina and Asian. We are ’SC.
However, all of us have one more thing in common: We were sexual abuse victims of USC’s former gynecologist  George Tyndall, and we are profoundly disappointed with the University’s response to this stain on our alma mater. If you are one of us, we urge you come forward and speak out. You are not alone.
According to the Los Angeles Police Department, Tyndall is estimated to have treated more than 10,000 Trojan women during his 27-year career as the only full-time gynecologist at the Engemann Student Health Center. Hundreds have now filed complaints alleging sexual abuse and mistreatment by Tyndall and more than 300 have filed lawsuits against the University.
These lawsuits tell a story of a university doctor using his position of trust to sexually assault, molest, photograph and terrorize his female patients for nearly three decades. They tell another story that is equally disturbing. The University routinely ignored complaints made about Tyndall to nurses and University employees dating back to 1989. Had that not been the case, none of us would have met Tyndall.
The University has acknowledged investigating Tyndall in 2013 and again in 2016. According to a 2018 report by the Senior Vice President for Administration, in 2013 “numerous witnesses were interviewed, including student health leadership, clinical supervisors, medical assistants and nurses.” The Office of Equity and Diversity concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find a violation of University policy. The 2013 interviews yielded mixed opinions of Tyndall with some witnesses stating that they “loved him” and others describing him as “creepy.”
The in-house 2016 investigation concluded that Tyndall violated University policy on harassment by making racist and sexually inappropriate comments to his patients during exams, but concluded that while his practice of penetrating patients with ungloved hands was “outdated and not current standard of care,” it was not criminal. They did not report  Tyndall to law enforcement or to the state medical board. Instead, they simply paid him to leave.
All of this was hidden from the public and the USC community until it was revealed by the Los Angeles Times in May. The University’s first response was to attempt to contain the scandal by encouraging students to report complaints about Tyndall to a USC-sponsored hotline. We later learned that these complaints went to University officials who collected information but did not directly report these crimes to law enforcement.
As the publicity about the scandal grew, the University responded by firing two supervisors in the student health center. When faculty members demanded the resignation of former president C. L. Max Nikias, the Board of Trustees issued a strong statement of full confidence in Nikias’ “leadership, ethics and values.” Three days later, Nikias announced his intent to resign amid outrage from students, faculty and alumni. Two months later, it was announced that Nikias would be named “President Emeritus and Life Trustee of the University.”
In the face of this turmoil, the silence of the Board of Trustees has been deafening. Is it that the male majority of the Board — which includes director Steven Spielberg, real estate mogul Ed Roski, Jr., United Airlines CEO Oscar Muñoz and The Washington Post publisher Frederick J. Ryan, Jr. — find it difficult to imagine the vulnerability that the rest of us feel every time we endure a gynecological exam for routine health care? Or are these men truly complacent about the fact that this powerful university failed to stop a sexual predator from molesting students for nearly 30 years?
The silence of the women on the Board may be even harder to understand. It pains us to think that Los Angeles Lakers president Jeanie Buss, former congresswoman Jane Harman and philanthropist Wallis Annenberg, to name a few, seem utterly unsympathetic to the women of our Trojan Family.
Think about this. If there is truly a Trojan Family, we are USC’s daughters, sisters and mothers. We are not its enemies. It is time to change a culture that puts the financial health of a University above the physical and emotional health of its most vulnerable students. USC, by its failure to remove a known predator, enabled George Tyndall to victimize three generations of women. It is time for USC to hold predatory enablers accountable and offer compassion and healing for the survivors.

The new USC Sound Professional and Vocal Performer Center in USC Keck School of Medicine opens at the end of the year and will cover care for “elite listeners,” as it works to use information for ear research.
The center will offer specialized help involving the ears, nose and throat. While the clinic can assist anyone, it is catered to those who use their voice and hearing for their professional lives, including individuals working in sound production, professionals in the entertainment industry and politicians.
“They use their ears, their hearing, for what they do everyday,” said John Oghalai, the otolaryngology department chair. “We [also] have a lot of singers, and people that use their throats for their instruments too, and they often are having a lot of more complex voice issues than regular users.”
Normal hearing tests do not always pick up subtle issues, Oghalai said. The new center hopes to provide opportunities for advanced testing to help people with more specific issues.
In addition to service, the clinic will also focus on research. When an individual chooses to have an appointment, they volunteer for a multi-disciplinary, three to four hour visit aimed to help the evaluation center improve its services. 
For one of the hearing tests, the ear creates an “echo” of the noise that can be recorded with a sensitive microphone, according to professor of otolaryngology Carolina Abdala. 
“We have created a test to use the information [from the echos] to tell how healthy the ear is,” Abdala said. “It might be able to discover pathologies that are so nuanced that audiogram, a basic hearing test, misses.”
This test, Abdala adds, could then help with future intervention or technology like hearing aids.

Alumnus Michael Blanton will serve as the vice president of the Office of Professionalism and Ethics after working closely with the University as a source of outside counsel. He previously served as a temporary Los Angeles Superior Court traffic judge. (Photo from USC News)
USC has announced plans to open an Office of Professionalism and Ethics, an office dedicated to consolidating and improving current University procedures for handling complaints and criticism, according to USC News.  
Alumnus and attorney Michael Blanton will serve as the vice president of the new office. 
Blanton, who worked as a source of outside counsel for the University, was offered a position to oversee USC’s Office for Athletic Compliance. Blanton has also served as a temporary Los Angeles Superior Court traffic judge.
USC decided to create the office after administrators realized the need for an efficient system to address problems within the university, according to Blanton.
The office’s official purpose was first referenced in a May 2018 community letter sent by former president C. L. Max Nikias.
“[USC] identified areas in which change was needed and structures needed updating … [to] manage investigations more efficiently,” Blanton said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The office aims to streamline and update USC’s processes for taking complaints and conducting investigations at all levels on its campuses, he said. 
“The goal [of the office] is to ensure that information is centralized at the university so nothing falls through the cracks, and that information is available when decisions need to be made,” Blanton said. 
Blanton hopes the office’s centralized tracking system will help identify trends in complaints and prompt a swifter response. 
“Drawing not only on my experience here at USC, but also from my nearly 20 years of litigating cases, my professional background provided a good foundation for my new role,” Blanton said. “Wearing the hats of advocate and investigator to objective fact finder will serve me well.” 
The Office of Professionalism and Ethics will have a distinct role, and will not replace any other institution. Blanton hopes to measure the office’s success through gathering community input after a few years of operation. 
“I’d like to survey students, faculty and staff and ask them, ‘Do you feel more confident about how complaints about misconduct are handled at this university?’” Balton said. “If the answers are mostly, ‘Yes,’ then I’ll know we’re on the right track.”

The augmented reality system, which will take three years to fully implement, will connect visitors to the past and aims to make education about the tar pits more engaging. (Photo courtesy of Kristin Friedrich)
Woolly mammoths may be extinct, but visitors at the La Brea Tar Pits will get to see one up close. By partnering with USC, the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County will introduce a new augmented reality experience to transport patrons back in time.
The USC Institute of Creative Technology partnered with the USC Rossier School of Education after taking an interest in how the La Brea Tar Pits presented natural history within Los Angeles. 
“It’s one of those places that’s extremely unique,” said Benjamin Nye, the director for learning science research at USC ICT. “You don’t usually get things that have essentially that kind of natural history directly in the middle of the city.”
The project will take three years to fully implement so that AR can undergo different test groups and designs.
“Essentially, what ends up happening is we have this sort of spiral inverted design process,” Nye said. “I mean a lot of the science is about being able to look at things and compare them.”
One of the challenges the La Brea Tar Pits has historically faced is overcoming visitors’ misconceptions about what the exhibit offers, according to the museum’s assistant curator Emily Lindsey. 
“Lots of visitors come here for dinosaurs … [but] dinosaurs have gone extinct 66 million years ago and the asphalt seeps here only started capturing fossils 50,000 years ago,” Lindsey said. 
Since the human lifespan is limited, Lindsey said it can be difficult for guests to fully grasp the difference in time. Implementing AR may help bridge the gap in understanding the history by presenting the information in a new and interactive way. 
To overcome this problem, the museum issued a questionnaire to volunteers, asking them for some of their initial thoughts on the exhibit. Test subjects would then go through the AR experience to see how tar pits trapped mammoths. Afterward, questionnaires were reissued to see if the guests’ degree of understanding changed after the AR experience. Developers used data from these responses to write a grant proposal that was funded $2 million by the National Science Foundation.
“We will now use the money to build a permanent exhibit at La Brea that will have a much more sophisticated version of the original beta version,” said Gale Sinatra, a professor of education and psychology at the Rossier School of Education.
Adapting AR to function in a museum has its time constraints, according to Nye. Since asking visitors to sit through a 20-minute video isn’t feasible for the space, developers have had to find ways to condense the material.
“It’s really trying to deliver a lot of high impact information to help people learn quickly,” Nye said. “But that essentially is getting the most important information and learning something.”
Utilizing AR in the museum will allow visitors to visualize the scientific process and  learn more about the history of the pits and the animals that were trapped there. 
“There’s a lot of work being done excavating remains from these animals,” Sinatra said. “We decided we could use augmented reality to help visitors envision … what’s happening in the present with scientists investigating what they excavate from the asphalt.”
The museum hopes that this AR experience will encourage new methods of learning at the La Brea exhibit.  
“Learning ends up being a lot like exercise if you’re not pushing it all the time, if you’re not applying it, the recall of the knowledge and the application of it,” Nye said. “I think that’s the big thing that you get out of something interactive.”

IDEAS Executive Chair Ana Mercado (right)explains the opportunities students, staff and administrators can take advantage of at the DREAM Center. (Gabi Thur De Koos | Daily Trojan)
Amid an unpredictable political climate, campus organization Improving Dreams, Education and Academic Success relaunched the Pop-Up 
DREAM Center for undocumented students on Wednesday. 
The center will offer office hours with the Immigration Clinic and the Health Center, Career Center workshops and a welcoming space for undocumented students and allies to talk, study and relax. 
“I think having this space symbolizes not only resources physically but also hope,” IDEAS executive chair Ana Mercado said. “We know that we’re building an alliance, building a community of students, of faculty, of professors, of administrators, that can help us not just while we’re in college but farther beyond.” 
Mercado and others involved in IDEAS and the DREAM Center have focused on building tools for the USC undocumented community. At the meeting, organizers discussed the organization’s accomplishments and history along with their success in adding “Immigration and DACA Status” as a tab on the University’s admission website.
“When I came in, there was already existing resources and a lot of energy from faculty and students along these issues and so my job was really just to come in, understand the resources we have and connect with the individual students so they could take advantage of those resources,” said Vanessa Gomez Brake, the associate dean of religious life and point-person for undocumented students. 
IDEAS wants to bring the DREAM Center, which is located in Kaprielian Hall, closer to the center of campus to be more convenient for students. Mercado and others are currently focused on demonstrating the need for improved space to the University by collecting data. 
“I hope that students do utilize this space because at the end of the day this space is here,” Mercado said. “It might not be how we want it but I think it’s a stepping stone to get to where we want.” 
The DREAM Center has provided immigration resources for students, staff and administrators since IDEAS initially launched it at USC in last spring after similar programs were observed at other universities. The club has aimed to create a safe and supportive space, while advocating for the undocumented community. 
The DREAM Center will continue to circulate information regarding upcoming workshops through flyers and social media. Mercado and the IDEAS team hope to continue to reach more undocumented students and serve as a permanently accessible safe space on campus.

Vice Provost of Undergraduate Programs Andrea Hodge sent a memo to Topping scholars and Governing Board members regarding changes at the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund for the new school year on Wednesday including the addition of five more graduate scholars.
The memo provided updates that have been implemented since the summer. In addition to selecting incoming transfer and graduate students for this school year, the Board decided to include 10 graduate students in the Topping Fund — twice the number of graduate students  in the past.
Additionally, the Topping Fund hired Brie Ortega as a temporary staff member. Ortega, who received a master’s degree in social work at UCLA, will be aiding the Board members as they “[develop] a strategic plan to guide our expansion efforts.” 
“She is available and ready to provide guidance and support to all Topping scholars,” Hodge said in the memo.
Other changes include the already completed renovations in the Topping lounge, as well as selecting new Topping Governing Board members for the year, which will now include representatives from the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments.

Senior Rianna Valdes comes into the 2018-19 season as the only senior on the team’s roster. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
The women’s tennis team opens its 2018-19 season this weekend with the ITA Oracle Masters in Malibu and the Battle in the Bay Classic in San Francisco. After falling to Arizona State in the Pac-12 quarterfinals, Gabby Smith went on to compete in the NCAA tournament as a senior last year. Three of USC’s players are already starting the season with their names in national preseason rankings. 
California native Salma Ewing is making her debut as the No. 5 freshman in the nation. She’s expected to contribute right off the bat, and will have her first chance this weekend in the mixed doubles section of the ITA Oracle Masters, along with men’s tennis sophomore and Israeli native Daniel Cukierman. They will compete Thursday morning at 8 a.m., followed by her appearance in the women singles draw at 10 a.m.
The Women of Troy’s only returning senior, Rianna Valdes, took the No. 74 spot in the national rankings. She made Pac-12 All-Academic second team last season and All Pac-12 honorable mention. Junior Angela Kulikov, a 2018 Pac-12 All-Academic first team member, and Valdes will compete as partners again this season and enter as No. 27 in the doubles ranking. The Trojans added freshman Estella Jaeger, who hails from Germany, to their roster. Freshman Danielle Wilson will also join this rookie squad. 
USC will be entering its second season under head coach Alison Swain, who won eight NCAA Division III championship titles at Williams College, and she looks to guide the Trojans to a long run in the tournament this season.
Junior Constance Branstine, sophomore Ana Neffa and freshman Danielle Willson will compete in San Francisco beginning Friday.

In its conference opener, which featured the famous crosstown rivalry, the women’s volleyball team protected its home court against UCLA in a 3-0 set (25-21, 25-8, 29-27) victory at Galen Center on Wednesday night. 
In the first set, the Bruins stayed on USC’s heels, but were not able to close out the match. From there, the Trojans surged ahead in the second set before battling it out in the third set to sweep the Bruins. 
“Our servers are getting a lot better,” said head coach Brent Crouch. “We had eight aces, one error and a bunch of overpasses. And that was really the match.” 
The energy in Galen Center was electric as the Trojans prepared for the start of their Pac-12 season. Before the match, fans were already on their feet, causing an uproar in the moments leading up to the opening set. The familiar melodies of “The Spirit of Troy” permeated the air as a section of timid UCLA supporters filed into the stadium. Even the men’s volleyball team made an appearance, sporting lighthearted costumes to boost morale. 
“I knew the energy and emotion was going to be off the charts,” Crouch said. “I came in and prepped to not have to provide any of that, in fact the opposite. [I] just told the girls to breathe and not get carried away.” 
The Trojans clinched a 25-21 win in the first set to establish the tone of the rest of the match. A strong defensive start left them hitting twice out of bounds in the opening stages of the set. From there, the Trojans maintained their lead, only losing it twice with the help of junior middle blocker Jasmine Gross, who ended the night with nine kills and a .444 hitting percentage. Gross is a new recruit who ranked among the top five NCAA blockers last year. 
“We always knew she could move really well on the net,” Crouch said. “She’s really fast, continues to read the game well, and we spent a lot of time working on her blocking too. When we added her to the team, this result is what we expected.” 
Spectacular digs from both sides elicited countless “ooh’s” and “ah’s” from all sides of Galen Center. Trailing by only one or two points for most of the first set, it was clear that the Bruins were still hungry for a win. At one point, the score rested at 13-13, with UCLA briefly pulling ahead of the home team. However a set-ending kill from junior outside hitter Emily Baptista sealed the Bruins’ fate. 
Much like the previous set, the Trojans set a dominant tone coming into the second as they grabbed 4 unanswered points from the Bruins. USC’s outside hitters were firing on all cylinders, leading the offensive drive with 11 combined kills. It was evident that the Women of Troy were communicating efficiently, ending the game ahead by 17 points. Crouch attributed the success of the set to both a sturdy defense and outstanding individual performances in the service game.
“It was really good to see our team connecting well, especially in the second set,” Crouch said. “[Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier] and [sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro] went back to serve for several points in a row. They just blew ‘em up.” 
In the face of tough odds, the Bruins put up a solid fight in the final set. For the first time that night, they opened by taking the first 2 points, only to give one up after a faulty serve. Baptista, Lanier and sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin continued to shake up the UCLA defense, recording a combined total of three blocks and 37 kills. Lanier’s spiking consistency during high-pressure moments ensured a victory for the Women of Troy, despite UCLA sophomore outside hitter Mac May’s attempts to keep the match alive. The final score was 29-27. USC had swept the Bruins in three straight sets, but a revitalized UCLA offense had the Trojan fanbase sliding off the edge of their seats. 
“They were crafty,” Crouch said. “They were tipping here, rolling there, they got all these different shots. We haven’t played a team that mixes in that much stuff. It got us scrambling in the third set.” 
While the victory against the Bruins is sweet, the 9-3 Trojans still have more work to put in this weekend with a game against Colorado in Boulder on Sunday. In their last 10 meetings with the Buffalos, the Trojans have finished with a victory in all but one of them. However, they are taking this game as seriously as any other and will take the three days until the game to prepare. Referencing mishaps that took place in Milwaukee, Crouch is well aware of how the team can be inconsistent after big wins such as Wednesday’s. He hopes to keep his game plan tight as ever for Boulder. 
“We have had some letdowns in the past,” Crouch said. “This upcoming match will be another opportunity to try to stay up and not slip. That’ll be everything we’re going to be talking about next weekend.”

Redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns has a total of 14 receptions for 157 yards so far this season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With its second home game fast approaching, USC took the field for one last practice on Wednesday night to prepare to host Washington State Friday. After suffering a battering on the road and a fall from the AP rankings, the team has had one goal this week — changing the culture on the practice field, in hopes that changes will follow in the Coliseum.
The team seems to agree that a different outcome is within reach. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels, senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware and head coach Clay Helton all repeat the same phrase every day: “We’re close.”
It’s a mantra for a team stacked with talent that seems to refuse to gel, for a 1-2 start that could have been 3-0 instead. It’s not a far-fetched platitude either. At times, the Trojans have shown glimpses of a team that could easily become a Top-25 powerhouse.
Yet Helton noted that the team has been unable to string together four complete quarters to create this outcome. Against UNLV, the team’s slow start was saved by a miraculous fourth quarter. Against Texas, the opposite occurred, with a dominant first quarter giving way to a messy collapse.
And the dominant factor in this season-opening disaster has been the team’s propensity for making sloppy mistakes. The Trojans gave up 99 yards — the length of an entire football field — in penalties against Texas. Over the course of their two losses, they tallied more yards in penalties (134) than rushing yards (109).
What does it take to smooth out this lack of discipline? Part of that answer has to do with the culture of practice, something  Helton tackled early this week during the quick turnaround of a Friday game week.
Helton took over offense practices himself on Monday, and on Tuesday he said that this week of practices has been “one of the best we’ve had all year.” The team came to compete after tallying two road losses, and Helton described the atmosphere at practice as “prideful” and “intense,” a welcome change to the sluggish pace of recent weeks.
The focus for the offense remains on the line, which has remained inconsistent throughout the opening three games, failing to protect Daniels in the pocket against UNLV and Stanford, then recording negative rushing yardage on the road at Texas.
In preparing for Washington State, Helton is attempting to boost the confidence of the line before it faces a physical front from the Cougars’ defensive line. He felt that practice this week has highlighted a shift in culture along the line.
“They’re a physical bunch of kids,” Helton said. “I believe in them. I believe they can get the job done.”
Personnel report
On Tuesday, safety Ykili Ross announced that he will be leaving USC to pursue a different program. In his statement, Ross said that “neither my talent nor my passion for the sport/game was being utilized to its maximum potential,” adding that his “development as a ball player and dedication to the team was not being showcased/invested in.”
Sophomore right guard Andrew Vorhees is expected to play in the Washington State game Friday after straining his MCL against Texas. Helton reported that Ware, who leads the team in rushing yards so far this season, has been struggling with a nagging knee injury, but remains likely to play on Friday.
“It flared up earlier in the week, so we limited his reps,” Helton said. “He looked better today.”
Sophomore left tackle Austin Jackson returned to practice after sitting out on Tuesday with an illness.

Live too long and all your heroes will retire.
Pretty much every sports fan knows that this saying eventually comes true, because athletes are human and knees give out and every career eventually comes to an end. I’ve seen some of my favorite players retire — Heather O’Reilly, Tony Gonzalez, Peyton Manning. It’s bittersweet, but you know it’s coming.
And yet, when Adrian Wojnarowski announced on Monday night that long-time superstar writer Lee Jenkins would be leaving Sports Illustrated to work in the front office of the Los Angeles Clippers, I was stunned.
I was partly confused because — I don’t know, because it didn’t make sense? As much as I respect Jenkins for his ability to interview athletes and craft a lede, I don’t see what he brings to the front office of any NBA team. What are the Clippers thinking? I’m fairly convinced Jenkins pulled off the greatest heist of all time, and I can’t begrudge him for it.
But mostly, I was sad. Every young writer is raised on the work of the greats. When their columns and features are released, we cancel our plans and hunker down to read them. For any young writer desperate to get better, these people are our greatest teachers. We don’t just read their articles for fun. We rehash, we obsess, we dig through archives of their work to learn.
That was Lee Jenkins for me. He was a tutor, a constant guide. Of course, he didn’t know this — I spoke to him in person a grand total of once, when he came to one of my classes last fall. (I was so excited when he walked in that I almost started crying.) But every time Jenkins wrote a profile, I was there, ready to rehash it all and figure out how the hell he wrote so well.
As an intern at Sports Illustrated over the summer, I took full advantage of the publication’s archives database to scroll back through Jenkins’ body of work and reread each of his stories. There was always something to learn, something to gain in a Lee Jenkins piece. How to interview, how to select quotes, how to craft a transition or build to a conclusion. Each feature was a master class in the art of writing.
Most importantly, however, Jenkins knew the key to great writing — how to make the reader feel something. His pieces made the reader feel as if they were there, in the hospital room with Chris Bosh, in the locker room with Kevin Durant. And he broke down pro athletes like nobody else, removing the statistics and the sponsorships to reveal the human underneath, and somehow coaxing that human to be vulnerable, at least for the length of his story.
I want to write like Lee Jenkins. That’s not a bold statement in any terms, because every sports writer wants to write like him. So it’s a strange thing to mourn, perhaps, but it’s hard to face the fact that this teacher, who guided the way I wanted to write for so much of my life, is leaving us for good. 
If I had known his last article was, in fact, his last, I probably would’ve savored it a little bit more. Instead, we’re now left with an expansive backlog of his greatest hits. It’s not the worst thing, for sure; but there’s just a little less to look forward to when my copy of Sports Illustrated arrives every Thursday.
Jenkins’ departure also leaves a hole in the world of sports writing. That hole feels approximately the same size as the one that Rick Reilly left when he retired (and then unretired again, only to write kind of badly, which was somehow worse than when he retired in the first place).
Despite what movies like “Set It Up” might lead you to believe, there isn’t really such a thing as a “superstar” journalist, at least not in the written media. It’s rare to see a person become a mogul through their writing. While Peter King or Bill Simmons pulled this off by establishing their brands, it’s even more rare to see someone like Jenkins, who exists on a higher plane of sports writing simply through the power of his words.
This is the writer who LeBron James hand-selected to announce his return home to Cleveland. The amount of respect that Jenkins commands is incomparable; he could enter the life of any NBA superstar and make himself completely at home. Over his career, Jenkins perfected the “art of hanging out,” the most vital skill for any journalist. Now, he’s as much a part of the NBA as any of the star athletes he wrote about.
Who will follow in his stead? There’s certainly a wealth of great sportswriters in this world, but there’s no one quite like Jenkins. It’s hard to say who will rise up to this level after him, and how they will do it. But if anything, this change makes me excited to see who will come next.
On Tuesday, I asked my sportswriting professor what he thought about Jenkins’ move, and his response surprised me. He wasn’t upset or sad; just happy that Jenkins had found a new avenue to pursue. 
He told me that it’s hard to grow old as a sportswriter. The job stops being fun, the shine of the athletes wear off, the words come less easily. For Jenkins, maybe it’s best to go out on top.
For many of us this feels like a loss, but for Jenkins it’s just the next step. All we can do is be grateful, and spend way too much time reading those old features — and say thank you, for inspiring an entire generation of writers like me.

Seeing little faces sing a preschool rhyme, their eyes bright with joy, can bring a smile to anyone’s face. But when I saw my students at Hoover Intergenerational Care (the preschool just across the street from USC Village) sing, I was smiling because they weren’t just singing joyfully — they were singing joyfully in Spanish.
The song was “La Araña Pequeñita,” the Spanish version of “The Itsy Bitsy Spider,” and every student was singing as loud as they could — whether they spoke Spanish or not. The majority of Hoover students are bilingual learners. Many of the kids speak Spanish at home, and as a result, the staff integrated both English and Spanish into the curriculum. 
We would sing songs like “La Araña Pequeñita” frequently, and when we read books to them, we translated keywords to encourage vocabulary development in both languages. 
Supportive language learning that treats every language as equally important is crucial for bilingual students in early childhood education. At Hoover, it was easy; since most of the kids already spoke some Spanish, being bilingual wasn’t different or shameful. And the students who didn’t speak Spanish didn’t feel left out either. In fact, one of my favorite memories at Hoover was teaching in Spanish to one of my students who didn’t speak Spanish at home. He was so excited to be learning something new, and so curious about the topic, that he didn’t mind being taught in a language he was less familiar with. 
But in classrooms where very few students are bilingual, where not all bilingual students speak the same language, learning two languages without the necessary support can hinder bilingual students. 
As a child, I would speak Hindi and English at home. Both my parents grew up speaking Hindi but were also fluent in English, so I felt comfortable using both languages equally. But when my parents dropped me off or picked me up from school, I wouldn’t want them to speak in Hindi to me because none of my peers could understand it. 
While I never had issues learning either language, I felt ashamed speaking in Hindi around my friends from school. As I grew up, I used it less and less. I still understand the language and can carry a basic conversation in Hindi with my grandparents, but I often feel like I’ve lost a part of my cultural heritage because I spent years distancing myself from the language. At school, English was clearly dominant, while the languages that other classmates and I spoke at home were never acknowledged.
Instead of ignoring them, we should celebrate the languages students bring to the classroom and encourage their development as a positive aspect of their learning and identity. 
It also exposes English-only learners to new cultures and languages, which has demonstrated proven benefits for cognitive development and language proficiency. According to the Rand Corporation, students in dual-language immersion programs outperformed peers in English-only classrooms by 13 percent on state standardized testing, and were 3 percentage points more proficient in English by the sixth grade. 
Encouraging bilingualism at a young age also serves students in their future — in many career fields, knowing multiple languages is a desired skill. In this case, not only does the individual benefit, but also society as a whole — as our world becomes more globalized, communicating with individuals from different cultures is increasingly important. 
Hoover and other schools like it should be regarded as models for early childhood bilingual education. English should be equal to other languages — supporting children in their native languages is one of the best ways to make their cultural heritage feel valued and important. 
When students’ home languages are celebrated and encouraged in classrooms, it benefits everyone — the students feel supported in their bilingualism, and the effects on their peers in terms of cultural and language immersion are advantageous as well. Too often, languages other than English are treated as lesser when they really should be championed to the same extent in learning environments.

Institutions of higher education around the country have always struggled with the amount of freedom they grant religious groups to spread their opinions in public. The biggest point of contention is religious groups proselytizing on campus — for example, the people who walk around campus and  hand out bibles or invite passersby to join their spiritual study group. Georgetown University, a historically Jesuit school, banned proselytism in 2007; Earlham College in Indiana discourages it; and Suffolk University allows it so long as it doesn’t involve religious harassment, which it defines as any “coercive behavior that affects one’s personal freedom to choose one’s own religious practices.”
Proselytism, by most definitions, refers to “any attempt to convert people to a different point of view.” That alone is nothing unusual: A person is proselytizing when they try to convince their friends to watch the latest movie or try out a new restaurant. Religious proselytism, however, is entirely different. Attempting to convert others to one’s own religion is a violation of personal rights and should be prohibited on college campuses.
According to USC’s Free Speech Policy, student organizations are permitted to discuss any question or opinion, both in public and private. Presumably, this means that any religious group that wants to share its beliefs has the right to do so. The policy further states, however, that “the imposition of opinions and concerns upon those who in turn dissent from them … is inconsistent with a university’s process and function.”
It’s a common experience to be approached by individuals who ask probing questions about a student’s religious background and if they would listen to a short presentation about Christianity. But even after explaining that they were not interested, they said that the religious groups insisted on continuing the conversation, which made them feel uncomfortable.
Many students choose USC specifically because of its lack of religious affiliation (the University cut ties with the Methodist church in 1952). For them, it is imperative that their spiritual lives be kept separate from their academic lives.
There are a number of reasons why students might not be interested in engaging in religious discussion. Some come from a religious family but value the diversity of experience that comes from interacting with people of different beliefs. Many were former members of the church but left for political or social reasons. Others are nonreligious or come from another background entirely. The experience of being preached to can be insulting, since it suggests that one’s beliefs are inferior to those of the preacher. An interaction could be interpreted as an imposition of beliefs on people who dissent from them, which the University explicitly discourages. 
“I think [religion is] good for people who feel that they need that in their lives … but they should respect others’ decision not to follow it,” said Allison Fischer, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
While the action of religious proselytizing could be seen as no different from, for example, a sailing club attempting to recruit students, the intent behind religious and nonreligious proselytism is different. Members of some religious groups go out of their way to engage with students, often stopping them on their way to class. Representatives from other student groups generally do not approach random students to lecture them, preferring to use less invasive marketing methods like flyers. Even though religious groups are trying to sway students toward their beliefs and create a positive impression, proselytizing tends to create negative feelings toward the religious group. 
While we must learn to respect people of all beliefs — religious or not — students should not be subjected to harassment by those who believe their worldviews are wrong. Not only does campus proselytizing transgress students’ boundaries, it also violates the word of God, and should therefore be heavily advised against. USC should follow the examples set by Georgetown, Earlham and Suffolk in taking definitive action to ban, or at least regulate, religious proselytizing.

Comfort food holds a particular and unique ability to pause the world and provide a singular, unadulterated moment of human bliss.
It’s 4:30 a.m. You can’t speak over the loud sizzle of butter on a massive grill, the clatter of plates as energetic bussers sweep tables clean and the drunken shouting from the boisterous tables around you. Every seat is full, despite the midnight blue sky that ushers in the morning. 
Amid the chaos, you grip the handle of a mug, warm from coffee with a half-and-half and two Splendas. It is easy to get lost in the motion of the people around you swaying in their seats, stumbling to the bathroom, digging through their pockets looking for cash.
But then a singular object steaming in the distance pulls you through the noise and back to your table — three pancakes, plate-sized, piping hot. 
They smile at you. It’s been too long. An irresistible aroma fills the air with swirls of toasted butter and melted sugar.  You want to embrace them — your lost loves, those pancakes. You want to kiss them and tell them you love them but you don’t know which to do first … but then you realize you’re already halfway through the plate.
This is the scenario I find myself in at least once a month at the Original Pantry Cafe. Nestled between the commercialized sprawl of L.A. Live and the den of shops at FIGat7th, the Original Pantry sits, unchanging, as warm and welcoming as I imagine it was in 1924, when it was just a kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles. It’s a relic; stepping into it feels like stepping into someone else’s dream of the early 20th century. And while the Original Pantry serves up a handful of other American classics like hamburgers, milkshakes and fries, there is nothing in the world that can compare to its pancakes.
I first visited the Pantry during my freshman year, just past midnight, clutching the wrists of two friends who had surrendered after an hour of my begging. To this day, the pull of the Pantry has been a cosmic mystery, as if Fate herself murmured in my ear, speaking sweet nothings about the sweet pancakes tucked into the skyline a mile away.
Since my first visit freshman year, the pancakes have been reliably euphoric, without a hint of variation. And it’s no surprise, given the surprising organization hidden under the chaos of the Pantry. The kitchen staff’s movements are like clockwork, visible on the griddle behind a pane of decorated glass. The griddle is divided into neat portions  — mounds of potatoes sit in a heap on one corner, a line of bacon sizzling down the middle. The pancakes dominate a corner of the griddle, scooped from a batter perfected over the decades and cooked slightly under, so when the pancakes reach your mouth, they melt on contact.
These pancakes dance on the line between delectable and decadent. Upon first glance, they appear to be nothing extraordinary, just three large pancakes in a stack, each with an even honey-colored top. But a single bite of pancake transports me into an simpler world, a sepia of emotion shaded only by the warmth and sweetness melting on my tongue. I have never felt a purer form of happiness than the happiness I feel running my fork through the tender, pillowy pancakes at the Pantry.
It’s within this pancake-flavored pleasure that I begin to understand what draws me and many other peoplew to writing about food. This simple dish, served with no extravagance or flair, has the power to transform my mood for the hour, for the day, even for the week. Food can be indicative of culture, history and family  —but it can also just be a delicious diner meal served 24 hours a day. 
It is the special, peculiar power of comfort food that brings me back to those pancakes. Eating them feels like a momentary escape from existence, a visit to a realm void of problems but filled with love. Of course the Original Pantry, a place seemingly frozen in a different era, would be capable of providing me this. And now, as time passes and I am faced more and more with the hardships of adult reality, a plate of warm, fluffy pancakes is all I need to take me back into the past.

New York-based data artist Jer Thorp explored how people live in an increasingly complex world of data. His lecture touched on his art insallation, which fought the rise of xenophobia in New York. (Eleanor Kim | Daily Trojan)
In the wake of data-driven scandals, including those involving Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, the conversation surrounding ownership of data has either been increasingly negative or indifferent. But whichever direction the conversation heads, the world is undeniably full of data. 
On Tuesday evening, Jer Thorp, a New York-based data artist and the Innovator in Residence at the Library of Congress, spoke to students and faculty about shifting the current definition of data to enact social change. 
Thorp’s talk encompassed the question: “What is it like to live in data?” He initiated the conversation by laying out the bleak reality of humanity’s current relationship with data, emphasizing the power dynamic between the controller of the data and the data’s subject. Specifically, Thorp referred to the lack of transparency and control users have over their own information.
“[What is it like to live in data?] It sucks. To be used. To be without agency,” Thorp said. “We forget how easy it is for advertisers to glean these pieces of meaning. We also get a sense of what we’re missing by not being able to glean this meaning from our data. We produce these records but we are not allowed to look at them.”
According to Thorp, the last defining factor of the modern data climate is its complexity. When data is complex, it limits the scope of who can control and understand it. Keeping the data complex deepens the divide between the winners and losers of this exchange. 
“The ways that we have come up with to communicate are very exclusive,” Thorp said. “They tend to be in a very singular language, usually a language that was born from the physical sciences and math and economics. So what do we do about this? What do we do with being overwhelmed with complexity?”
The answer lies in Thorp’s own projects. He walked the audience through personal data visualization projects designed to present data in a way that the general public could understand.
In 2017, Thorp showcased his  project, “We Were Strangers Once Too.” Inspired by former president Barack Obama’s speech on immigration, Thorp created an installation designed to combat the rise in nationalism and xenophobia. The installation featured 33 poles each inscribed with the home country of New York City’s immigrant population. To do so, he placed the installation right in the heart of  New York City’s Times Square. When viewers took a step back, the different colors on the poles formed a heart.
“People ‘selfie-d’ in front of it, but they ‘selfie-d’ in front of where their grandmother was from or where their brother played soccer,” Thorp said. “It forces people to understand that there are webs in their lives that are connected to all these countries. We also had people get married in front of it. I love that.” 
Thorp’s projects range from visualizing hotel data to the titles of art pieces. The last piece Thorp highlighted was the St. Louis map room. Wanting to reimagine a map room’s association with institutional power, Thorp and his team transformed a St. Louis high school gymnasium into a place where groups could come and author maps of their own communities. The groups’  maps would be overlayed with public civic maps in hopes of offering a new perspective on their community. 
Through this, obsolete practices such as redlining, a strategy used to disenfranchise black communities from real estate, become relevant again. Thorp highlighted a specific group of ninth graders who created a map of “safe spaces” in their neighborhood. By overlaying their map with a public redlining map from the 1930s, students saw how redlining districts aligned with the well-being of certain communities even today. 
“The idea that 80 years later this map was still showing itself in their neighborhood changed the way that they thought about their lives,” Thorp said. “In fact, they went back afterward and made this project about the redlining maps and how they reflected themselves on the [current] neighborhood.”
Thorp ended the talk by answering his original question, painting a brighter future of the potential of data. According to the artist, data is not an abstract concept that only statisticians and experts can understand, but rather is a tool for storytelling. Thorp argued that this comes with putting data in public spaces and thinking about the individuals behind the numbers.
“A new way [of approaching data] is about data well-being,” Thorp said. “How can we structure our approaches to data such that well-being is at the core of it?”

Danielle Boyce never imagined that the earrings she made for fun would one day form the basis for an online business. 
But when she wore them to her internship at the lifestyle blog Studio DIY, her boss loved the handmade pieces so much that she suggested Boyce put them up for sale. Two years later, Boyce’s love for jewelry and knack for entrepreneurship is evident in Muchacha, her slowly developing statement earring business.
Boyce’s earrings have been featured on Studio DIY’s blog, and have their own Instagram page and website. But Boyce, a sophomore in the USC  Iovine and Young Academy, had only shown her earrings to her family and friends before starting the enterprise. 
Accidental entrepreneur · Danielle Boyce, a sophomore in the Iovine and Young Academy, began selling her earrings online at the suggestion of her peers. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
“[W]hen someone I really respect creatively … said that I should sell them, I was like ‘OK, I’m actually going to do this,’” she said.
Muchacha began when Boyce “haphazardly” made seven earrings, designed some graphics on Apple word processor Pages and set up a shop on e-commerce service, Etsy. At the time, Boyce mostly relied on her high school graduation money to sustain the business, but as it grew and made more revenue, she invested in higher quality parts for her products. 
So far, Boyce has had 11 product launches, with another due later this week. Each launch features seven earrings patterned with different colors and variations. Making the earrings requires an assembly-line process, Boyce noted, though it’s difficult to quantify how long the process takes because each earring is made differently. The “pom-pom earrings” can be made in 10 minutes while “resin earrings” need to cure overnight because they require liquid synthetic resin to harden in a mold.
“I make a ton of them, so … it seems like it consumes every waking hour of my life,” Boyce said. 
When Boyce was naming each earring, she originally came up with quirky names like “baby danglers” and “glitter dazzlers.” However, she recently started giving names that embodied the qualities she saw in each set of earrings. On the day of the interview, she spent 30 minutes looking at her earrings and deciding on an appropriate name before calling them “well-rounded hoops.”
Muchacha’s studs and hoops are always 14-karat gold-plated and lead-free, which presumably makes them more comfortable to wear. Boyce was once unable to wear earrings for a week after one pair hurt her ears and hopes to help others avoid similar issues.
Boyce, who was raised in a predominantly white community with parents of different races, also tries to infuse her business with Mexican culture. Muchacha means “young woman” in Spanish, a decision Boyce made to  explore her Mexican culture through her craft. 
Coming together · Boyce gives her creations distinctive names, which she hopes will highlight the character she sees in each individual pair of earrings. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
“I think Mexican culture is very vibrant and beautiful, and I really want to honor that in the work that I do,” Boyce said.
With her newer sets, Boyce started to imbue feelings and emotions into the earrings so that people could try to embody those qualities while wearing them. She is always driven to make new pieces when customers or friends tell her that they felt more confident wearing her statement earrings. She hopes that her earrings are expressive and reflective of the people who wear them.
“It’s this notion of the way you dress affecting the way you act and the way you perceive yourself,” Boyce said. “And so when you put on statement earrings, you think, ‘I can pull these off. I can pull off these weird, crazy, giant accessories.’”
