Last Thursday, President  Barack Obama announced sweeping executive actions to tackle the nation’s immigration policy. He laid out his plans in a prime time speech that was aired on CNN and Univision.
“First, we’ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings and speed the return of those who do cross over,” Obama said. “Second, I’ll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, we’ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country,”
Pundits agreed the most aggressive point that the President made throughout the speech was in regards to the estimated 11.4 million undocumented immigrants, as estimated by the Department of Homeland Security.
The reforms will allow undocumented parents of those who have been in the country for more than five years and who currently hold a green card or are U.S. citizens to avoid deportation. An expansion of the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals also protects children who arrived in the United States before January 2010. The previous plan only gave protection to those who arrived before June 15, 2007.
According to the Migration Policy Institute, nearly 3.7 million unauthorized immigrant parents would be impacted by the new legislation, with the number of immigrants being affected by the updated DACA increasing to nearly 1.5 million.
“In addition to students who might now qualify for the expanded DACA program who didn’t previously, the current plan would also directly impact USC students to the extent that they are U.S. citizens/legal permanent residents, and their parents are undocumented,” said Emily Ryo, a professor at the Gould School of Law. “Many of those parents could now receive temporary protection from removal, which would prevent painful family separations — and that obviously would directly impact the well-being of our students who are in such mixed legal status families.”
California stands at the forefront of the nation’s immigration discussion.
“We are the state that has the most settled immigrant population in terms of people who have been in the country for 10 years,” said Manuel Pastor, a co-director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at USC in an interview with The New York Times.
The California Immigrant Policy Center and USC researchers released a joint study in September discussing the impact that immigrants have on the state economy.
“Undocumented immigrants in California alone contribute about $130 billion of California’s GDP — a figure greater than the entire GDP of the neighboring state of Nevada. Additionally, immigrant households make up 27% of the total household income in California, and thus represent a substantial share of all spending power in the state,” the report stated.
President Obama’s executive actions come after failed reform attempts by the White House in 2013 and under President Bush in 2007.
“I think it’s quite understandable what the President has done given the political deadlock on comprehensive immigration reform that’s happened in the past,” Ryo said.
These illegal immigrating actions taken by the president only hurts  the legal immigrant population who played by the rules,  and the unemployed. Now, you kids will be competing for jobs with these folks who come out of the closet.

Students have formed planning task forces as part of the next step in creating a house for USC’s black student community.
On Oct. 28, the Undergraduate Student Government passed the “Space for Students of Color” resolution, which laid the groundwork to create a house to serve as a designated place for USC’s black students. To advance the project, the Diversity Affairs committee held a meeting on Nov. 20 to create and recruit students to one of four task forces, each with a unique goal in developing the house and the program. The four task forces are: funding/real estate, communications (which includes social media and public relations), education and logistics.
Work in progress · The Diversity Affairs committee, a division of Undergraduate Student Government, organized students into four task forces to develop the Black House project in a meeting on Nov. 20. – Kristen Zung | Daily Trojan
For the student leaders on each task force, all signs point towards a project that is organized, has a cohesive vision and is moving forward.
The funding and real estate task force is chaired by Skylar Dunn, co-director of diversity affairs for USG, and Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, executive director of Program Board. For Dunn, the challenges of finding an investor are difficult but not insurmountable.
“That’s probably the hardest of the four [task forces],” said Dunn, a senior majoring in business administration. “Money and property are the two hardest things to come by in L.A.”
The funding task force aims to work with the other three to develop a plan to reach out to investors and educate them on both the mission and vision for the house. Dunn says despite the challenges, after a Daily Trojan article on the project that ran earlier this month, investors reached out to the student leaders wanting to help.
“Investors love the idea and the vision that we have — they’ve actually reached out to us,” he said. “[Daily Trojan writer] Jordyn Holman put out a story 2-3 weeks ago, [and] we received an email from an alum who was really impressed with what we were doing and he really wanted to help us out.”
Amoafo-Yeboah, a senior majoring in psychology, said the team hopes to carry that momentum into broader cooperation with the Black Alumni Association, an alliance she called “crucial.”
“We want to make it clear that their main focus is and always will be scholarships,” she said of the Association’s main goal: providing scholarships to black students attending USC. “But that doesn’t mean that individuals who are donating for scholarships can’t donate for this as well.”
The communications task force is led by Maddie Lees, a USG Residential Senator, and Rini Sampath, USG Vice President. Lees described the role of the task force as communicating a broader message to the community of the need for more diversity and inclusiveness on campus.
“We want to reinforce the point that this is a stepping stone for other groups on campus who don’t feel comfortable or who feel marginalized,” she said.
Levi Powell, co-director of Diversity Affairs with Dunn, stressed the importance of the task force in overcoming the project’s early challenges.
“The task force will make sure the ideas and visions for the house are streamlined,” Powell said. “One of the hardest things we had to deal with was communicating the idea to everyone and make sure they understand our vision for this house and this space.”
The education task force, also chaired by Amoafo-Yeboah, will focus on programming and adopting successful ideas of existing campus institutions, such as the East Asian studies room in Doheny Library, and making those ideas useful for the needs of the project. The fourth and final committee, logistics and vision, is focused on developing a name and mission statement for the house and a logistical plan for the physical space. The task force is chaired by Powell and Casey Ellis, the co-director of the Black Student Assembly.
Powell stressed the need to name the house something that embodies the project’s mission, rather than just the current informal name, “the Black House.”
“We don’t want it to be named, ‘the Black House,’” he said. “We are modeling our naming process off of Brown University’s project, which is called the Harambee house, which is Swahili for ‘togetherness.’ Some things we want to incorporate into our name are unity, togetherness, community and family.”
The student leaders plan to select assistant directors for the task force in the coming week. Each task force will submit progress reports by the last week of January, and Amoafo-Yeboah said a first draft of the business plan and proposal will be completed by the first week of February. Though the original goal for completion was between two and four years, Dunn said a more realistic expectation was between five and 10.
“We have to buy property, do all the refurbishments to the house, figure out a sustainability model to keep the house running, and have to have the university as well as alumni support to set all of this up,” he said. “We don’t want to rush this; we want to have patience and wait it out in order to get that big dream that we want.”

Professors from USC’s Pullias Center for Higher Education developed a video game called “Mission: Admission” meant to encourage low-income students to attend college. It aims to teach high school students the importance of meeting deadlines and learning the application process.

“The game is really targeted at first generation students — students who don’t have a lot of support at their school,” said Zoe Corwin, research director at the Pullias Center. “Some might have support from their families, but they might not know much about the process. They learn strategies, and they get to practice those strategies in a safe place. And hopefully, they get to apply them to the real-life application process. It’s a non-threatening way to learn strategies for applying to college.”
Players select a character and set educational goals for him or her. After inputting a family income, students learn about the financial aid process from the app, which is currently a Facebook game. The characters need to keep up with counseling meetings and attend writing workshops. With each step forward, the student gets closer and closer to being prepared to apply to college. The tasks to be completed by the player of the game are meant to familiarize players with college entrance exams, application essays and necessary financial aid materials.
“Our research center partnered with USC’s Game Innovation Lab and local high school students,” Corwin said. “We conceptualized the game and did a lot of play testing with out target audience. We made many changes based on their feedback and research findings. It was a collaborative and productive effort.”
Students at the Foshay Learning Center, a Los Angeles Unified School District campus near USC, were among the first to test the application. According to the Los Angeles Times, one student’s reaction to the video game was exactly what USC education and technology professors were hoping for. Alex Chinchilla, a high school senior at the Foshay Learning Center, played the video game, and his virtual failures made him realize the work that he should put in to his actual college applications.
According to the L.A. Times, some students complained that the energy that allows students to move through the game was too slow and that the design of the game was not modern enough. Most, however, understood and appreciated its overall goal and educational purpose.
Initial research found that the students who played “Mission: Admission” more than once demonstrated a wider knowledge about the application process and financial aid documents and deadlines than those who did not, according to the L.A. Times. The app utilizes technology to broaden a high school student’s college search beyond just schools that use the Common Application.
“This new college admissions-related application attempts to appeal to “our increasingly technology-focused culture,” David Hawkins, public policy and research director at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, told the L.A. Times.
The Game Innovation Lab at  the School of Cinematic Arts has been working on college admission applications for around five years. The U.S. Department of Education awarded USC a $3.2 million grant towards this project to promote higher education. USC plans to use the grant to move the game from Facebook to a mobile phone app or Internet platform in order to access more students.
“We are expanding our reach to 50 schools throughout the school of California,” Corwin said. “We are also doing a much more in-depth longitudinal study which is going to study the effect of the game on college outcomes.”
Before the federal grant, the development of the app cost $4 million, including the sponsorship from USC, the Gates Foundation and the Gilbert Foundation.
USC owns a share of FutureBound Games, the new company built to establish a future for the game. In addition to moving it off Facebook, the company plans to keep the game free for students to play in the future.to play in the future.

The USC campus was briefly put on lockdown Monday night following a large contingent of protesters marching near the university on Figueroa Street. The demonstrators were protesting following a Missouri grand jury decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal Aug. 9 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.
The campus lockdown occurred from roughly 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. All university gates were closed, and students were not allowed to enter or exit campus.
The protest began in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles after the grand jury decision was announced at approximately 6:30 p.m.  Dept. of Public Safety Captain Ed Palmer and Chief John Thomas were in attendance monitoring the situation prior to the grand jury announcement.
“Captain Palmer and I, we both were at Leimert Park. The crowd was peaceful protesting, and they decided to walk,” Thomas said. “It just got bigger, a lot bigger.”
As the protest grew, it marched in the direction of USC. The demonstrations eventually reached the southeast border of campus at the intersection of Exposition Boulevard and Figueroa Street shortly before 10 p.m.
DPS had prior preparations to conduct a modified closure of campus if demonstrators approached the university, according to Deputy Chief David Carlisle. Thomas also mentioned that extra officers were dispatched around campus in order to prevent potential vandalism and trespassing of campus grounds.
Some students who were stuck on campus expressed discontent with the lockdown.
“I thought it was pretty frustrating because it was a peaceful protest and they were locking us down on campus as a form of protection,” said Jennifer Binley, a senior majoring in international relations who was in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center when the lockdown began. “I thought it was kind of ridiculous because it’s going to be an important part of our history and the fact they weren’t letting us see it or even let us participate was frustrating.”
But not all students were kept from the march. Passing protesters were heard chanting “out of the dorms and into the streets” as they passed nearby off-campus apartments, and some USC students joined the demonstration. One student participant, Jon Sine, said he was there to demonstrate unity with the marchers.
“I’m tired of police brutality, and I want to show solidarity,” Sine said, who is a junior majoring in political economy. “This isn’t a one race issue, this is an issue for all within the United States.”
As of press time at 11:30 p.m. Nov. 24, the protesters had moved to the Interstate 110 freeway.
Jordyn Holman and Joseph Chen contributed to this report.
If you took any two Chinese grad-students from USC and parked them in an old-model BMW in front of ANY 15-to-35 year-old male from Ferguson, they would end up shot in their car seats executionary-style and robbed of their cell-phones… especially if the Ferguson males wore the same red clothing and posed for photos using the same sign-language with their hands similar to the style of Michael Brown..

With all the ways to stream, buy and play music, it only makes sense that everyone’s iPhone is filled to the brim with playlists. There are playlists to rally you before going out on the weekend, playlists to study to, playlists to soundtrack your shower and morning routine and playlists for everything in between. But up-and-coming singer Geneviève Bellemare has an EP that won’t allow for that reduction. With a sound so unique and rooted in multiple genres, it’s not so easy to simplify her music down to just one playlist.
New in town · Geneviève Bellemare has just moved to Los Angeles and will attempt to find a new audience with a show at The Mint on Dec. 5. – Photo courtesy of Sacks & Co.
The Oregonian singer has moved to Los Angeles and as her first show in the city, she’ll be performing at The Mint on Dec. 5. She’ll be doing songs from her new EP, “Live and Die,” which was released Aug. 5.
Before beginning her solo career, Bellemare had been in three bands — a process that wasn’t easy for her to be in or get out of. She describes herself as a very indecisive person, a fact that she swears anyone who’s gone to a restaurant with her can testify to, so confronting her band and explaining to them that it was time to go separate ways was a self-described traumatic experience. It didn’t help that Bellemare had just broken up with her boyfriend. Despite her dreading having to tell them for weeks, it wasn’t the aspect of going solo that she feared, but rather upsetting those around her. One day the decision just set in, and she knew.
“It’s a band, but it was always kind of my stuff and me trying to come out as a singer but also working with everybody more as like, kind of in a team way,” Bellemare said. “That was the issue. I don’t have the right kind of personality to tell people that this isn’t a democracy, that this is something I really need to be right, to present myself.”
But her journey to find her identity as a singer is still ongoing. Bellemare admits very openly that she still doesn’t have a clear performing style or a go-to explanation for where her songs come from. And somehow, that is where the magic in her music comes from. Bellemare’s confident uncertainty speaks to the part of the listeners that’s still trying to find its place but also inspires them to continue doing so. It’s refreshing to hear an artist who’s still searching for herself since it’s something so many of her listeners are doing as well.
But that’s not to say her music suffers from this uncertainty — in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Bellemare’s exploration of herself allows her music to be unlimited and unchecked. Without having to overanalyze where her music is coming from or going, it can bleed into multiple genres and reach into various emotions without feeling forced. Everything about “Live and Die” is fresh and organic in a way that enthralls and invigorates the listener.
“I don’t think that there’s a clear definite message I’m trying to send, but I think there might be a theme happening that I’m still kind of unaware of,” she said. “I’m pretty submissive emotionally in life, and I think through my songs I’m trying to figure out that really strong side of me as a person.”
Bellemare puts an openness into her music that she hopes to also get out of her performances. For her, concerts are about the connections that she makes with the audience. Instead of focusing on grandiose displays of entertainment, Bellemare just wants the audience walk away with “that feeling where they say, ‘I like her EP but it’s so much better live.’” And when everything aligns and Bellemare and the audience connect, she says the stage fright is worth it because the feeling afterward is priceless.
“When the audience is really into it and it just seems like they’re listening, it creates a stillness in the room, that’s when the connection happens,” Bellemare said. “When the whole room feels like that, it becomes this one awesome thing that happens.”
It’s hard not to feel connected to the music with Bellemare’s beautiful, crooning, sultry vocals accompanied by jazzy tones, a pinch of rock rhythms and hints of the indie world. It’s the kind of music that feels like it should be listened to through old-school, D.J.-style headphones while slowly swaying around the bedroom.
When asked what was next for the budding, young singer, her reply was simple: “Europe.” With no set plans to go overseas yet, Bellemare just wants to get out and see the world one day with music as her ticket.

For some people, stressful party planning and hours of cooking have come to define Thanksgiving. Though I enjoy the delicious food and festivities associated with the holiday, Thanksgiving has always been a day of togetherness and thankfulness in my large Armenian family. Every year, nearly 30 people gather in my grandmother’s small apartment for an evening filled with eating, storytelling and lots of laughs. My grandmother makes the same tried-and-true recipes; more important than the food, however, we relish each other’s company and celebrate my family’s arrival to the United States on Thanksgiving 46 years ago.
Holiday cheer · Squash and caramelized onion toasties (pictured) evoke the warm, comforting feeling of the Thanksgiving holiday. — Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
I developed the following recipes with the goal of retaining the true spirit of the holiday. They are simple and straightforward to prepare, yet incredibly satisfying, allowing you to spend more time with loved ones rather than slaving away in the kitchen.
The squash and caramelized onion toasties capture the season’s warm, comforting flavors without being heavy. Silky butternut squash is roasted until tender, gently mashed with sweet, jam-like onions and piled on top of a piece of cheesy bread. The toasties would be a lovely start to your Thanksgiving feast, but also make a great weeknight dinner when topped with a fried egg and served alongside a green salad.
Baked sweet potatoes are a simple yet scrumptious side dish. A completely hands-free recipe, the sweet potatoes take care of themselves in the oven while you prepare other, more labor-intensive components of the meal. Once baked, melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon seep into the potatoes’ soft flesh, creating a glorious combination of sweet and savory.
My Brussels sprouts and parmesan salad adds much-needed freshness to a menu filled with decadent offerings. The zingy Dijon vinaigrette and grated Parmesan transform the bland, one-note flavor of the Brussels sprouts into something truly remarkable. This is an ideal salad to make a few hours in advance. Not only will you save time once your guests arrive, but allowing the ingredients to marinate together deepens their flavors.
Squash and Caramelized Onion Toasties
• One 2 1/2- to 3-pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
• 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
• 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
• 1 large yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced
• 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
• 2 tablespoons maple syrup
• 4 slices country bread, cut 1-inch thick
• 1/2 cup goat cheese or feta, at room temperature
• Salt
Active: 30 min; Total: 45 min. Makes 16 toasties.
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. Place squash slices on the baking sheet and toss with 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and red pepper flakes until evenly coated. Roast until fork-tender and light golden in color, anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the density of the squash you use. Leave roasted squash on the tray.
2. While squash is roasting, heat remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add vinegar and syrup and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until onions are jammy and broken down, another 10 to 12 minutes.
3. Pile onions on top of roasted squash, still on the baking sheet. Use a fork to gently half-mash the mixture together. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
4. Reheat the same skillet to medium-high heat. Add just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. Cook bread slices until golden brown and crisp, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Cut the slices into individual toasties. To serve, spread about 1 teaspoon cheese on each toastie and heap with the squash-onion mixture.
Baked Sweet Potatoes 
• 4 medium sweet potatoes
• Melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, for topping
Active: 5 min; Total: 1 hr. Serves 4.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly scrub the sweet potatoes under cold running water and prick each one 2-3 times with a fork. Place the sweet potatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until tender and soft, 45 minutes to an hour depending on the thickness of your potatoes.
2. Allow the potatoes to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. To serve, slice each sweet potato open lengthwise, drizzle the inside with melted butter and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.
Shaved Brussels Sprouts and Parmesan Salad

Retrospective exhibits for artists who have enjoyed long and fruitful careers are a treat because one can see the evolution that their work went through over the arc of their career. At a Picasso retrospective, the transition between blue, cubist and surrealist is the real star of the exhibit. At the new Josef Koudelka exhibit at the Getty Center, one marvels not only at the striking shifts his career took, but also at the sheer variation in the subject matter he chose to portray.
Major influence · Josef Koudelka covered the 1968 Warsaw Pact Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, bringing its images to the world. – Photo courtesy of J. Paul Getty Museum
The Czech photographer made his fame by documenting the Soviet 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of his home country, but his exhibit shows periods of fascination with the daily life of the Romani people, the effects the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the impact humans have on the environment.
The exhibit unfolds chronologically through Koudelka’s life. The first room presents his early photography, including some very interesting photographic experiments. It is, however, when a visitor arrives at the next room, showcasing his work with the Romani, that Koudelka’s powerful touch begins to emerge. The moments he was able to capture in the lives of the Romani people show a sharp eye for capturing evocative, powerful images.
Though these first images begin to show his talent, it is the next room covering his work in the 1968 invasion where one can see Koudelka’s ability in full display. These images would have been important regardless of quality, as they were one of the few to make it out to the West after the Soviets took over Czechoslovakia. But, the pictures are not powerful simply because Koudelka was in the right place at the right time. His talent for capturing the intensity of the moment is never as obvious as in this part of the exhibit. The outrage in the faces of the young Czechs confronting the oncoming Soviet tanks is palpable, and the tension is present in every desperate shot. The story of hardship accompanying these photographs makes their quality all the more impactful. It took a year for Koudelka to smuggle his photographs out of the country to be published under the pseudonym P.P., which stood for Prague Photographer. Eventually, Koudelka left Czechoslovakia and sought asylum in France, but his documentation was destroyed, causing him to end up without an official country. He was declared to be in “Nationality Doubtful” status, a decision that gave the exhibit its name.
The way the photographs are presented adds to the impact of this section. The images are packed close together and the room is dark except for the images themselves creating an effect of energy where the photos seem to charge into each other, maintaining a consistently manic energy.
The talents forged in the fires of the Soviet invasion shows in his work from after leaving his home country. Another series of photographs shows daily life in France, Ireland, Spain and other parts of Europe. Koudelka has an almost preternatural ability for being at the right place in the right time.
Advancing through the exhibit, visitors encounter the central hall next. There is an 80-foot-long installation through the center of the floor of the great central hall. Its presence is jarring, mirroring the drastic shift in the focus of his work. The photographs from this part of his career onward change drastically in terms of subject matter. There isn’t a single person visible in the rest of the exhibit. For a photographer who so expertly captured the spirit of the people in his photographs, this shift is a bold one. The center divider, impossible to ignore, features a series of his next project: panoramic picture depicting different areas where the influence of men have affected the environment. One is a former forest with only a few trees left, another is of a mound of ash. The pictures lack the immediate action that his earlier works showcased, but they remain powerful in a different sort of way. His keen eye is still obvious and his new focus is achieved admirably.
Again, the setup of the exhibit itself mirrors this tonal shift in the photos. The photos are larger and more sparsely placed on the walls of the much bigger room.  This gives the subject matter in this area a stoic feel. This stoicism continues in the final section depicting different landscapes affected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Koudelka finished this project last year, and the sparse photographs focus again on the landscapes of the area, ignoring completely the people that inhabit them.
The tonal shift in the middle of Koudelka’s career is striking but the bodies of work on both sides of the rift are equally impressive in their respective ways. The Getty presents these different periods with a steady hand while mimicking the changing tones in his work resulting in a well-crafted, can’t-miss exhibition.

William Leonard Roberts II,  better known as Rick Ross, is a man of many locations: The Mississippi-born rapper grew to prominence in Carol City, Florida, took on a stage name borrowed from a Los Angeles-based drug kingpin and is now a worldwide rap phenomenon. Hood Billionaire, in stores now, is his second album released in 2014. It follows the tepidly received Mastermind, which hit shelves in March.
As a rapper, Ross was never quite the snippy little wordsmith he fashions himself to be — the round mound of grunting sounds has essentially buoyed his career by pairing the exhumed corpse of a plus-sized mobster shtick with an ear for impossibly catchy production.
In all honesty, Mastermind’s most memorable moment was a hook from Big Sean, and its most quotable line was Kanye West mispronouncing the word “handkerchief” — which should tell you everything you need to know about that album. In contrast, Hood Billionaire is new production territory for the rapper, but that doesn’t necessitate that it’s a fresh-sounding or altogether enjoyable effort.
The album begins with the title track, where Lex Luger’s piano loop woozily careens and swerves over a crushing bass line while Ricky Rozay blesses his audience with lyrical gems such as “Rules of the game / Jack of all trades, icy on the court at the basketball games.” Again, listeners shouldn’t go into a Rick Ross album expecting to be enlightened about domestic policy issues or the necessity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but these are pretty elementary lyrics, even by Ross’s low standards.
Aside from talk of planes, trains and his various automobiles, Ross’s ear for production seems to have failed him this time around: the aforementioned title track lacks the breakneck trap-like energy of producer Lex Luger’s previous efforts. Speaking of trap, it gets worse: “Trap Luv (feat. Yo Gotti)” sees Ross erring into down-tempo, soulful production territory as he compares himself to Lionel Richie and raps about his recent weight loss. The contemplative beat that’s pretty mediocre on its own legs is hampered by mind-numbingly bad verses from both Ross and guest rapper Yo Gotti, who manages to espouse his conspiracy theory about iPhone 6 tracking capabilities while maintaining a rhyme scheme fit for a grade school poetry slam.
Of Ross’s collaborators, Jay Z’s guest spot on “Movin’ Bass” is perhaps the most welcome. Mr. Beyonce Knowles offers up a hook worthy of a throwback back to his Life and Times of Shawn Carter days, sounding far too zealous as he throws in the hook “Coppas tried to knock us off, but we still movin’ bass,” extending the “s” on that “bass” with a kind of unsettling zest that makes you wonder if he misses the days when crack was in his palm and he was watching the long arm of the law.
The album’s highlights are few and far in between, but a little scratching and digging reveals tracks like “Coke Like the ‘80s,” puts the typical Rick Ross formula to the stress test. The track combines massive, trunk-bumping bass, hand claps, a menacing piano line and a catchy, simplistic hook (hint: look at the track title) that’ll have listeners longing for the days of red leather jackets and Rick James concerts. Ross ups the energy, his vocal register and presumably his heart rate on the single “Elvis Presley Blvd.” where the rapper informs us that he’s “riding down Elvis Presley Boulevard” no less than 15 times. Despite the braindead lyrics, collaborator Project Pat sounds in fine form, his languid flow navigating the syrupy, horned-out beat with a veteran’s familiarity.
Even for a genre mired in tacky stereotypes and tasteless tropes, Rick Ross’ Hood Billionaire is an ultimately forgettable plate of retreaded material that fails to produce a single that could generate any hype. Instead, releasing two albums in one year announces to the world that making the type of music Rick Ross is putting out isn’t anything particularly labor intensive on the part of the rapper — and the lack of effort shows up in the worst way on Hood Billionaire.

USC sophomore Su’a Cravens came to Troy carrying a four-star recruiting ranking and high expectations. Even after a  tough knee injury and a position switch, the safety-turned-linebacker has not disappointed. Daily  Trojan staff writer Hailey Tucker sat down with Cravens to discuss his early life, future aspirations and his USC career thus far.
DT: What was your most memorable moment from high school football?
Cravens: Winning the [CIF] championship my junior year. It was the story game, the rivalry game. It was the team we played in the championship the year before, and it came down to the last drive of the game, the cliché and all that big game-winning touchdown. I remember that game like it was yesterday. The crowd stormed the field; that moment was special.
DT: You graduated from high school early to enroll at USC. What was the recruiting process like for you, and why did you decide to graduate early?
Cravens: My parents wanted me to get in the rotation of things fast; they didn’t want me to wait, and they felt like I was ready.  They were forcing my commitment a little earlier. If I didn’t come to ’SC my mom probably would have had a fit. I knew I was going to ’SC as soon as I got the offer my junior year from Lane Kiffin. I was recruited by [Ed] Orgeron, [Lane] Kiffin, [Troy] Polamalu. I made the commitment on June 6, on my mom’s birthday.
DT: You tore cartilage in your knee when you were a freshman, what was that like for you?
Cravens: I tore my meniscus my freshman year when I early enrolled. It set me back a little bit, but it gave me time to get stronger and to mature. I didn’t really have an understanding of the fact that this game can end at any moment. You can’t just rely on football to get you through life. Getting hurt was a blessing in disguise.  It allowed me to mature and to look at the game differently. I have to take care of my body. I have to take care of school. Always be on my p’s and q’s.
DT: What has been your favorite experience at USC so far?
Cravens: The Stanford win last year. I’d never seen 90,000 people storm a field. My helmet got taken away from me, I got picked up. People were yelling at me saying, “Fight On!” That’s probably the ultimate recruiting pitch to throw at somebody. I’m a freshman and I’m living the dream. I used to watch this growing up, and now I’m the one someone at home is watching, saying, “I want to be just like him.”
DT: Do you think there’s more pressure playing at USC than at other schools with the legacy and everything?
Cravens: With the history that we do have, USC is the most scrutinized school. If you choose ’SC over Notre Dame, Michigan or Alabama, people are going to say you’re an idiot, but we always have the attitude that we don’t care what anyone else thinks. We’re going to go out and fight, and fight on. We are ’SC for a reason. When you look at that logo, you got to respect that.
DT: How do you deal with the expectations coming in here?
Cravens: That’s what you sign up for. If you don’t want to be on the big stage and play for a school that has pressure, go somewhere else.
DT: Do you think USC attracts a certain kind of player?
Cravens: Absolutely. You’re not going to come here if you’re not an All-American, if you don’t have that dog in you. If you’re scared of competition, you’re not going to come here. ’SC makes you embrace competition and face it head on.
DT: Where do you envision yourself at the end of your senior season?
Cravens: Hopefully I’ll be an All-American and an award winner, Thorpe. I want to see us in a national championship game. And we are playing Alabama my senior year, so that will end all the hype about SEC vs. Pac-12.
DT: Is your ultimate goal with football to play in the NFL?
Cravens: My dream is to make it to the NFL and win a Super Bowl. Not just make it to the NFL, but to win a Super Bowl, and that’s what I plan to do. My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers, but at the same time I love California and the warm weather. So I would not have a problem going to any team in California, Texas or Florida.  I wouldn’t be complaining if any team drafted me, though.
DT: What was your best memory growing up?
Cravens: I would say whenever my family would go to the beach or when we would all go to my grandma’s house. We would always play football or basketball in the front yard. Somebody would always get hurt, somebody would tell mom, we’d all get yelled at, then we’d be right back out there playing again.
DT: Do you have a role model in your family?
Cravens: My dad. If it wasn’t for my dad, I wouldn’t be here. He started working me out when I was in fifth grade. I would work out with him when I got home from practice. He made sure I stayed hungry and stayed humble. I love my dad, and I’m grateful for the things he’s done. I talk to him on a daily basis.

The Women of Troy look to salvage their season this week, as they travel to Arizona and UCLA to close out a disappointing 2014 campaign. This season has been a rocky ride for the team (14-14, 7-11 Pac-12), which started the season 6-0, but has dropped 14 of its last 22 matches, including four straight — the team’s longest losing streak since 2009. These losses all came in conference play against Oregon, Oregon State, California and Stanford. USC dropped out of the NCAA top-25 for the first time all season.
Block solid · Junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms leads USC with 90 blocks this season, just a year removed from a early-season injury. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
USC has struggled at home this season, winning only four matches while losing eight. On the contrary, the Women of Troy have performed much better on the road or at neutral locations, going 10-6 on the season so far. With that in mind, it might be a good thing that the Women of Troy will be ending their season on the road.
USC will look to improve its dismal record against Pac-12 opponents against the Wildcats and the Bruins. Despite this record, the Women of Troy have seen stellar season performances from a number of their players. Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio has been a major aspect of the Women of Troy’s offense this season. She has a team-high 442 kills on the season, as well as an impressive 77 service aces. Bricio is also second on the team with 299 digs.
Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has had a nice season after returning from an injury with 284 kills, 14 service aces and 124 digs. Freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis, junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and sophomore outside hitter Elise Ruddins have also produced triple-digit kill numbers for the Women of Troy. Most of the assisting has been done by senior setter Hayley Crone and sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola, who have combined for 948 assists.
In order to be successful on the road, the Women of Troy will have to win close sets, a goal that USC has failed to accomplish over the course of the season. In the last two matches alone, USC has lost a set by five points or less on four different occasions.
In the case of No. 17 UCLA (19-10, 10-8), the Women of Troy have the benefit of having met the Bruins earlier this season and should know what to expect come Friday.
First, however, come the No. 14 Wildcats (22-8, 11-7 Pac-12), who have not faced USC yet this season, but will be ready for the challenge. Arizona is rolling right now, having won four of their last five matches. The key players for the Wildcats are outside hitters Madi Kingdon and Taylor Arizobaland middle blocker Halli Amaro. Kingdon has been the dominant force on offense for Arizona, racking up 549 kills, which is more than double of the number of kills that any of her teammates have tallied. She is also third on the team in both digs and blocks, with 348 and 62, respectively. Arizobal is second on the team in kills with 265 and has 57 blocks on the season. Amaro is fourth on the team in kills with 155, but she also has more blocks than anyone on the squad, with 84.
Following their match at Arizona on Wednesday, the Women of Troy will finish their season on Friday at UCLA. When these two teams clashed earlier this season, then-No. 20 UCLA upended then-No. 9 USC 3-0, and the Women of Troy lost a pair of those sets by just two points.
Five players for UCLA boast 110 kills or more on the season, led by outside hitter Karsta Lowe with 590 kills. Lowe, who was just named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for the fifth time this season, is the only player on the team to have a triple-digit number of both kills and digs. Outside hitters Reily Buechler and Olga Strantzali, and middle blocker Zoe Nightingale, will also be important UCLA players to watch. Buechler is second on the team in kills with 300 and has been consistent on defense with 94 digs and 41 blocks. Strantzali has recorded 164 kills and has 17 service aces, which is second to Lowe’s team high of 29 service aces. Nightingale has 120 kills and leads the Bruins in blocks with 90. UCLA is coached by Michael Sealy, who led his team to an NCAA Championship in 2011.
In order to become eligible for the NCAA Tournament, USC will have to win one of these two matches — an unfamiliar position for the team that’s earned a trip to the tournament for the last 22 straight years, and is just four seasons removed from a berth in the national semifinals. The Women of Troy and veteran head coach Mick Haley will need all players to step up in order to finish the season strong and carry some momentum into the postseason.

USC’s loss to the Bruins on Saturday exposed a lot of the team’s shortcomings, but there remain some more systemic flaws which have led to the Trojans’ poor performance later in games this season. The keys to a win over Notre Dame will lie in avoiding some major weaknesses in the Trojans’ game plan.
1.     Recover mentally from the loss to UCLA.
USC was understandably despondent following the loss to UCLA at the Rose Bowl last Saturday. The Trojans will need to recover mentally to salvage what remains of the season and prevent head coach Steve Sarkisian from having yet another seven-win season. The Trojans will not see a major bowl game this year, but that doesn’t mean they’re allowed to slack off against a perennial rival in Notre Dame.
The annual game against Notre Dame means a lot more to alumni and boosters than younger students might realize, and is one of the key litmus tests for a successful season. Sarkisian needs this win perhaps more than anyone else right now. Losing to both rivals was ultimately the nail in the coffin for former interim head coach Ed Orgeron, and though the prevailing sentiment seems to be to allow Sarkisian a bit more time, a win against a still highly regarded Notre Dame team certainly won’t hurt recruiting and team support moving forward. Plus, come on. It’s Notre Dame.
2.     Continue to protect the football.
In the Trojans’ loss to UCLA, USC did a solid job protecting the ball but gave up the ball at two crucial junctions that ultimately shifted momentum in the Bruins’ favor. USC has done an excellent job holding possession for much of the season, which has resulted in time of possession advantages.
This type of “heavy play” will work well against Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson, who has a tendency to gamble on some of his throws. Golson has 13 interceptions on the season and has had trouble taking care of the ball this season — holding possession after a turnover will put Golson out of his rhythm. Golson knows a thing or two about standing on the sideline with the game out of his hands — it’d be nice if the Trojans could re-acquaint the heinously overrated former Heisman hopeful with the concept.
3.     Build an early lead.
This has been an integral point for the Trojans in virtually every game this season. The Trojans are excellent front-runners — they play well with a lead, but have trouble catching up from behind and will pay for a shoot out in the fourth quarter, when a high-risk, high-reward strategy involves dropped passes and incompletions that lengthen the overall game and gas out the defense with constant rotations.
If Golson is forced to make the same risky throws, the Trojans might be able to force a turnover, which in turn will get more rest for their defense — and start another one of their trademark clock-eating drives in the process. We don’t need to win sexy — we just need to win. If Notre Dame creeps back into the game in the second half, the Trojans need to have built up a strong enough cushion to where they can put the game out of reach with a couple scores.
4.     Run early and often.
The Trojans, as in just about every other game this season not involving an opponent with a hilariously bad defense, will have to rely on the run to set up the pass, so to speak. Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen and sophomore running back Justin Davis will be called upon to gash and dash through a defense that is giving up 157.7 yards rushing per game. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s effectiveness through the air is contingent upon Notre Dame committing defenders into the box to free up the offense’s intermediate routes and to get one-on-one matchups for junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor.
Notre Dame’s pass defense has been rock solid this season, holding opponents to 227 yards per game. If the Trojans were, say, 9-2 going into this game, this would be Allen’s Heisman showcase. If. Excuse me while I go weep for 45 minutes.
Overall, the key to victory for the Trojans has been the same all season. Clearly, if they were able to overcome their issues in the second half, they would have done so a long time ago. This is a team suffering from serious depth issues and an inability to maintain a strong level of play through four quarters. It’s not something that can be fixed with coaching or practice, just more bodies. It’s time to come to terms with the depth issues that have been the elephant in the room with USC all season long and finish the season out on a high note.

The USC football team will attempt to avoid losses to both of its biggest rivals for the third consecutive season on Saturday afternoon, when the Notre Dame Fighting Irish visit Los Angeles. The Trojans (7-4, 6-3 Pac-12) were thoroughly outmatched in a 38-20 loss to No. 9 UCLA last week, eliminating head coach Steve Sarkisian’s team from Pac-12 title contention. For his part, Sarkisian is attempting to put the loss in perspective.

“For a variety of reasons we didn’t put our best foot forward,” the first-year coach said. “We didn’t play a brand of football that we’re capable of. At the end of the day, when you lose and you’re a competitor it hurts. The challenge is getting up off the mat, getting back on the horse and continuing to fight. I believe that we’ll do just that.”
The Fighting Irish (7-4) were in the hunt for an NCAA playoff berth less than three weeks ago, but consecutive losses to Arizona State, Northwestern and Louisville derailed their national title dreams. Still, the team is talented and dangerous, with a dramatic four-point loss to top-ranked Florida State on its resume.
Leading the way for Notre Dame is quarterback Everett Golson, who missed last season with academic issues after helping the Irish to a BCS National Championship Game appearance in 2013. This year, he ranks eighth in the nation in passing yards (3,280) and is tied for seventh in touchdown passes (29). Wide receiver William Fuller has emerged as Golson’s favorite target, hauling in 66 receptions for 962 yards and 14 touchdowns. That last mark places him among the nation’s elite, second only to Colorado State’s Rashard Higgins (15). Six-foot-4 wide receiver Corey Robinson — son of NBA Hall of Famer David Robinson — is a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses, racking up 505 yards on 37 catches. Sarkisian has been impressed with Notre Dame’s aerial attack.
“Everett [Golson] is a really talented guy,” Sarkisian said. “He’s very athletic, he gets out of the pocket and makes plays down the field. He’s got some really good wideouts to throw the ball to, big physical guys.”
Fortunately for the Trojans, Notre Dame’s success through the air hides an inability to take care of the football. Thirteen interceptions — including six from Golson during the team’s three-game skid alone — and 11 lost fumbles give the Irish a turnover margin of minus-two, a number that would rank ninth in the Pac-12. Though the USC secondary gave up 326 yards and three touchdowns to the Bruins’ Brett Hundley last week and has been inconsistent throughout the year, its biggest strength lies in takeaways. Of the Trojans’ 12 interceptions, half belong to dedicated defensive backs, with another two coming from sophomore linebacker-safety hybrid Su’a Cravens. Though that may be an impressive stat, Sarkisian feels that the key to forcing interceptions lies in the front seven.
“You got to get pressure on [Golson],” Sarkisian said. “We need to try to get into his face. We can’t let him sit in the pocket and see clearly. We need to make it as difficult as possible on him.”
On the defensive end, Notre Dame is performing better than recent scorelines would indicate. The Irish did not allow a single 100-yard rushing performance through their first five games, and have given up 300 yards passing just once all season. The team’s most lopsided loss — a 55-31 defeat against Arizona State on Nov. 8 that remained competitive deep into the fourth quarter — was decided by the Sun Devils’ second pick six of the game. The Irish are also playing without their defensive anchor, linebacker Joe Schmidt, who injured his ankle against Navy on Nov. 1 and will miss the rest of the season. Sarkisian admires the unit’s talent and resilience.
“They’re good up front,” Sarkisian said. “I know they’ve been battling a few injuries here as of late. They’re very aggressive and like to attack the run game and attack the quarterback. It’ll be a great challenge for us.”
For USC redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, the Notre Dame defense will serve as a roadblock to rebounding from a devastating loss.
“We’re excited,” Kessler said. “It’s going to be a fun game. [Losing to UCLA] hurts, obviously you never want to lose to your rival. Guys have to realize it’s been a long year, and hopefully we can end it on a good note and go to a good bowl game after that.”
Saturday also marks Senior Day for the Trojans, who will honor 12 players in a pregame ceremony. Key contributors from the senior class include safety Gerald Bowman, kicker Andre Heidari, linebacker Hayes Pullard, defensive back Josh Shaw, linebacker J.R. Tavai, tight end Randall Telfer and offensive lineman Aundrey Walker. Kessler expressed his appreciation for the leadership that this group provides.
“We’re not playing for ourselves [this] week,” Kessler said. “We’re playing for guys like Randall Telfer and Hayes Pullard. Guys who stayed through these sanctions and have been leaders the whole time. They’ve worked so hard and kept this team together.”
Notre Dame leads the all-time series 45-34, and has held onto the Jeweled Shillelagh for the past two seasons. Last year, the Irish secured an ugly 14-10 victory in South Bend, Indiana, after two missed field goals from Heidari. The famed rivalry has spawned many memorable moments, including 1988’s No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown and the “Bush Push” in 2005. Sarkisian, who last faced the Irish in 2009 as the head coach at Washington, focused on the unique nature of the series.
“It’s a great rivalry,” Sarkisian said. “It’s one that I’ve always appreciated being a part of. It’s so unique because of the proximity of the two schools, not being very close, but the rivalry is so intense. I love to be a part of it.”
This year’s showdown kicks off Saturday at 12:30 p.m. PT on FOX.
Quick Hits
USC redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen still has a chance to lead the Pac-12 in rushing. Allen is 21 yards behind UCLA’s Paul Perkins, with one game remaining in the regular season. Perkins might have the upper hand, however, as the Bruins control their own destiny in the Pac-12 South. A conference championship game berth would give Perkins and the Bruins 14 games instead of 13.
Tavai returned from a knee injury last Saturday, but only played 16 snaps against the Bruins.
Shaw saw action on defense and special teams against UCLA after coming back from his 10-game suspension. He is not listed as a starter on the team’s depth chart this week, however.
Notre Dame linebacker Jaylon Smith is one of five finalists for the Butkus Award, given to the nation’s best linebacker. Smith switched his jersey number from 9 to 38 in honor of Schmidt last week.
Golson has one career start against the Trojans, as a sophomore in 2012. The Irish won that game 22-13 in Los Angeles on their way to the national title game.
This is only the 12th time in 86 all-time meetings that both the Trojans and the Irish are unranked.

My roommate and I rode our bicycles to the Goodwill on Figueroa this evening. We were two black women together on the street. I wouldn’t have said that of us any other day. Any other day, we’d just be two students. Not tonight. Tonight, our identities are skin deep. Tonight is one of those dark hours in American history that divide us.
I mourn for Ferguson. Maybe you can’t understand how pain can be shared by an entire race across the nation, spanning thousands of miles like a plague. That’s okay. You don’t have to understand. However, it would be in your best interest to try. My first message is to you.
The anger you will witness tonight and in the days to come — the rage and disappointment the media will shamelessly magnify — is not some new revelation. It finds its roots in decades (centuries, in fact) of deaths, in thousands of unfair trials, and in deep, deep pain. We don’t know all of what happened those months ago in Ferguson. Neither does the Grand Jury. There are two sides to every story, and the one side that could possibly clarify the truth is that of a dead man.  Before you jump to unwarranted conclusions and call my people and their fury biased and unjustified, consider that today’s verdict is based on a fragmented story; their anger is fed by crystal-clear American history.
The second message is to my people, and it is not what many of you want to hear.
Do not be the violent fools they think you are. Do not answer wrongdoing with wrongdoing. If one cop is killed in retaliation, if just one innocent life is lost tonight because of our lack of restraint, then we have made true criminals of ourselves, and we are no better in nature than anyone who’s ever murdered our children.
I don’t think I’ll sleep tonight.  Tomorrow, perhaps the day after, I’ll be just a woman again.
But tonight, I am black.
Tonight, I am angry.

USC hosts Notre Dame on Saturday in the last week of college football’s regular season. The teams sport identical 7-4 records, and recently both had their hopes to make the College Football Playoff dashed. Notre Dame looked like a serious contender until losing three straight games heading into this weekend, while USC’s hopes to back into the Playoff by stealing the Pac-12 title ended when the Trojans lost to UCLA.
USC will attempt to slow down Irish quarterback Everett Golson, who was in the conversation for the Heisman trophy for most of the season. The Notre Dame defense, meanwhile, will be tasked with slowing down USC junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, who had off-games at the Rose Bowl last weekend.
Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen interviewed Isaac Lorton, the football reporter at Notre Dame’s The Observer, to give Trojan fans a better picture of what to expect in the nation’s best intersectional rivalry game on Saturday.

“Our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it.”
On Thursday, President Barack Obama unveiled executive action that could offer protection for about 4 million from deportation in the United States. Under the plan, those eligible would be required to register themselves with the government, undergo a federal background check and begin paying taxes in exchange for a protected status from deportation for up to three years.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
In the absence of any attempt at immigration reform from congressional leaders, Obama’s move to lift the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants is a positive step towards addressing the nation’s dire need for comprehensive immigration reform.
Under the executive action, undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have resided in the country for at least five years would be offered legal reprieve, lifting the threat of deportation and giving them access to work permits. The action would also expand the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which permits young immigrants under the age of 30 who arrived to the U.S. as children to apply for deportation deferral.
The President’s executive action garnered expected criticism from many of his Republican colleagues, who decried his decision as an unjustifiable use of executive authority. House Speaker John Boehner tweeted that the President was acting like an emperor by imposing the new order. Others, such as incoming majority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, blasted the President’s actions, threatening, “If President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act.”
Little did Sen. McConnell know that that’s exactly what the President wants him to do. “And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer,” Obama said in Thursday’s address. “Pass a bill.”
Those critiquing the new executive action because they think such matters should be legislated by our representatives and not the president should be addressing the real culprit — Congress itself. The fact of the matter is that Congress had the opportunity to address immigration reform when bipartisan legislation was passed by the Senate last year. The bill stopped with the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, which refused to act. Perhaps now that the party has both the House and the Senate under its control, it finally can.
Congressional leaders should do more than cry executive overstep to address the issue of immigration reform — an argument that really has no legal merit considering several of Obama’s predecessors, including President George H.W. Bush, have taken similar actions with regard to immigration policy in the past. Rather than blast the President’s decisive action, the best course of action for the Republican Party would be to demonstrate that they themselves are capable of passing comprehensive immigration reform that could actually be signed into law.
With a new GOP-controlled Congress coming in, the ball is ultimately in their court. The opportunity for congressional leaders to address the nation’s immigration issue under a unified Congress is approaching — it’d be a shame if they wasted it.

“Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave. The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.”
These are the words of former Texas Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan (1936 –1996). Some background: Ms. Jordan was the first black person elected to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction and the first southern black woman elected to the U.S. Congress. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was the first black woman to be buried in the Texas State Cemetery. Her dad was a Baptist preacher and her mother a maid. She was denied admission to the University of Texas, thanks to Jim Crow laws, and attended Texas Southern instead. But most important, when Barbara Jordan spoke, everyone listened regardless of their political affiliation. She was a brilliant and electric orator.
Rep. Jordan is relevant to the immigration issue because she was appointed Chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform by President Clinton. In 1995, after the Commission released its findings and recommendations, Rep. Jordan was called to testify before Congress on the issue of immigration. And the key declaration of the committee she chaired was the statement at top about the importance of deportation to sound immigration policy. This coming from a formerly poor, black, empathetic, brilliant Democrat who, nevertheless, didn’t let her compassion blind her to good policy for our country.
President Obama, on the other hand, chose to selectively enforce U.S. immigration laws, which is very Latin American and problematic. You see, countries that respect and enforce the rule of law, and expect their leaders to do the same, have the highest living standards in the world. These “first-world” countries include the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Norway, etc. Now compare the living standards of Latin American countries where it’s common, if not expected, for elected leaders and even low level bureaucrats to enforce or ignore laws as they see fit. It’s this crucial cultural difference that we Americans must maintain to keep this country great, and where President Obama failed all of us.
The president has usurped the constitution plain and simple. He admitted in the past that he cannot change it unilaterally with a pen and phone, but that is exactly what he is trying to do. He could have done something with Congress and the Senate when he control but he left it alone and only dealt with Obamacare. That is his fault for delaying. The president thinks he can rule by decree and gain favor among Latino voters. He thinks he can save the party by doing this step as well. It won’t work. There can easily be an injunction put in place by SCOTUS or the Congress can defund his initiative and/or shut down the government. This action is amnesty and nothing more. The system is broken but a single individual cannot make the law of the land. The socialist president has went far beyond what any previous president has done.
How is public announcing that you are going to selectively enforece the law a “step forward”” The executive must consistently execute the laws as written or convince lawmakers to change them. To do otherwise is anarchy or monarchy. The president is not just a leader of the government. The presidency stands as a role model for all citizens. To announce lawlessness as a policy only invites citizens and non-citizens alike to follow suit.

President Barack Obama’s speech on immigration overhaul last Thursday didn’t do much to further the conversation. Though the plan he outlined has its merits, the greatest weakness is that no matter how impactful, it’s still only temporary.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
In a controversial act that has some critics crying abuse of powers, Obama took executive action by deferring deportation for almost 5 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the country. “[W]e’re going to offer the following deal,” he said. “If you’ve with been in America more than five years. If you have children who are American citizens or illegal residents. If you register, pass a criminal background check and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.”
At a glance, it seems like a sound plan, but by what logic will Obama be able to say, “This many and no more?” Fast-forward 26 months when a new president will occupy the White House, and Obama’s actions seem all the more transient.
The measures were also worded in a deceptively promising  way. “All we’re saying is we’re not going to deport you,” Obama said. According to the Associated Press, that’s not all that will happen. The changes will also make those covered eligible for work permits, allowing them to compete with citizens and legal residents for jobs.
Obama would also have done better by giving Congress a chance to take up immigration reform instead of issuing an executive action himself. One option going from here would be for Congress to, as Obama said, “Pass a bill.” But that’s easier said than done. The more practical options are grimmer. Congress will most likely either shut down the government, prevent the president from carrying out his order by withholding funding or use Obama’s actions as an excuse to do nothing over issues like tax reform. Republicans are already considering defunding Obama’s proposed immigration reforms with legislation.
Many other aspects of this broken immigration system have been left unsolved after Obama’s speech. For one, while there will be temporary protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants who came to America as children — “Dreamers,” as they’re often known — the parents of these individuals won’t be included under Obama’s executive action, according to The New York Times. The number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border was also trivialized in Obama’s speech. “Although this summer there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is actually lower than it’s been in nearly two years,” he said. It wasn’t just a “brief spike” — the numbers have been on the rise since 2011, according to the AP. In addition, the overcrowded conditions of detention centers that led Obama to call the lack of space an “urgent humanitarian situation” a few months ago wasn’t mentioned in the discussion about reform either.
Clearly, though Obama’s speech had all the usual marks of a political piece — anecdotes about the hardworking immigrant-dreamer and appeals to American ideals of equality and opportunity — many glaring issues still remain. Whether or not it’s a violation of power, Obama’s executive action is only a Band-Aid over a wound that will continue to fester for years to come.
