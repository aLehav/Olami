Last semester, I had a bit of a difficult adjustment because I could not find a club I enjoyed being a part of — I only joined two during the involvement fair. I ended up quitting both of them by the end of first semester, and I felt completely idle and lost without a group of people I felt connected to. In high school, I ran cross country, swam on the swim team, volunteered at a law firm, sang in choir, performed in theatre and headed two clubs, so I was used to being overcommitted all the time and met so many people through my activities. When second semester rolled around, I submitted a plethora of applications to various new clubs, so I would never feel idle again. I ended up getting accepted to most things I applied to, and I quickly realized how unrealistic it was to keep up with everything I was committing myself to along with my studies. Of course, I am getting by, but it really hit me in the past few weeks when I realized I have not had nearly as much free time this semester. I like being busy, and I was used to it in high school. That being said, college has no structure as high school does, which can make it extremely difficult to keep up with everything. On a typical school day in high school, I would have choir during the school day, club meetings during my activities periods, and rehearsal or practice after school; then, I would get straight to my homework. 
In college, classes could be any time of day during the week, and clubs may not necessarily line up with your schedule. On top of that, activities and classes both demand more of you in college than in high school. I have learned my lesson this semester that you really cannot do it all in college without sacrificing precious and scarce leisure time we have as full-time students. When deciding what activities to do, it is always good to remember that deeply committing yourself to one or two clubs or activities will be much better in the end than trying to be a part of four as I did this semester. Ultimately, I am glad I did try a lot of different things because it helped me make more friends and meet more people, but I know that I will have prioritize more efficiently in the future. So my advice to my fellow freshmen is to join what interests you, but do not do it unless you are absolutely positive that you want to fully dive into it. Time management is key because overextending yourself is always a bad idea, and I can say that from personal experience. Put yourself out there but remember to put your mental health first over being overwhelmed!

Don’t spread yourself thin. University admission officers nowadays know that all that fluff applicants put in their admissions package is just that–fluff–and sometimes flat out lies. I read somewhere that a lot of selective school admissions departments want students who focus on, maybe a couple, or even three extracurriculars at most, during their high school years. Putting 6, 7+ is exaggeration. Plus, even if you did them, it was just going through the motions. 
Don’t be fake.

The Board of Trustees has approved a 3.9 percent increase in undergraduate tuition for the 2017-2018 academic year, according to a USC press release. The new cost of tuition, $53,448, is up $2,006 from the current price.
According to the statement released by the administration, the USC tuition hike is at a five-year average low, and “reaffirm[s] [USC’s] longstanding commitment to maintain one of the nation’s largest financial aid pools and access for qualified students.”
Even with these increases, the University said that full tuition only covers 78 percent of the total cost of instruction, and the average cost of attendance  — which includes housing and fees — covers 57 percent. USC also noted that it has one of the largest financial aid pools in the nation, awarding over $545 million each year from all sources, and that Trojans graduate with less debt on average than students who attend other private universities.
U.S. News and World Report placed USC in the top 10 most expensive tuition rates in the country for the 2016-2017 academic year, with mostly elite liberal arts colleges ranking ahead of it.
“The value of a USC degree keeps getting stronger,” Provost Michael Quick said in the statement. “We want to create a high-touch environment that ensures all students have access to the world’s best faculty, academic programs that prepare them for the 21st century, high-value internships and career services, and an exceptional residential college experience.”
Undergraduate Student Government President-elect Austin Dunn said he saw the news as a step forward for the University, as the administration was forthright about the news of the tuition increase, though the press release only covered the cost of tuition.
“It was quite an accomplishment for us regarding transparency in financial decisions because the press release did provide a few infographics,” Dunn said. “We will be continuing to have quite a few conversations regarding the entire cost of tuition with President Nikias and Provost Quick.”
Olivia Deveau contributed to this report.
What is all that fundraising money being used for?  You’re getting billions in donations and still jacking up tuition?  Is it good PR to shoot for the 80K a year COA price tag?
So absurd. When I was a student at SC, I remember in one class the professor asked “If you could attend a different school which would it be?” And one student replied, “George Washington University.” So the prof. asks “Why?” The student went on, “It’s the most expensive school….blah blah blah.” I don’t equate how expensive a school’s tuition is, to how invaluable the experience there will be. That is dumb……Instead I go by the WSJ’s rankings. And a few years ago, they concluded that the two most powerful schools in the world, bar none, are Harvard and Stanford. Well, why? because they produce the most billionaire alumni, with Harvard  being #1 and Stanford following. Justification for exorbitant tuition.

At the beginning of Jack O’Grady’s freshman year at USC, he found himself wishing for a way to know what his friends were up to and what events were happening on campus. Now a sophomore majoring in physics, O’Grady has developed an app called Packup that allows users to see what both friends and strangers are up to in real time.
“Everyone is within a one-mile radius, hanging out 24/7,” O’Grady said. “It was so different from high school, the dynamic of constantly making plans. So I started toying with the idea of being able to see who’s free and who’s not, and through a year and a half of iteration arrived at where we are now.”
The app allows users to indicate their availability with a red, yellow or green light. It also provides two feeds, one with friends and one with strangers, where people can share binocular-shaped photos of their location and present activity. Packup currently has a little over 400 users, including many USC students.
“We are really interested in the idea of presence — what are people doing right now?” O’Grady said. “It goes beyond just your friends but everyone around you because they’re the ones influencing how popular a cafe is, how long the lines will be. We wanted a way to connect people in real time to help them explore places, figure out where to go.”
As his idea expanded into something tangible, O’Grady found himself in need of more manpower, so he recruited two other USC students to join his team. Quinn Ellis, a sophomore majoring in computer science, assumes the role of chief technology officer and does most of the programming, and Peter Kaminski, also a sophomore majoring in computer science, manages the data and server backings. Each has their own area of expertise, but together, they were able to combine their talents to build Packup.
“Jack and I started last year around October, so it’s been a year and a few months,” Ellis said. “I did all the programming until over the summer [when] we hired Peter Kaminski, who does a lot of the back end stuff. Every time we do a small launch and get feedback, there’s a lot of stuff we learn, and there’s a lot of stuff we have to change that we thought was going to work, but didn’t.”
The team readily admits that the photo-sharing app seems similar to social media giants such as Instagram or Snapchat right now. But they were quick to emphasize the real time aspect of Packup as well as its utility and ease in helping create instant plans.
“We found that even though the pictures are different, it’s still just a picture,” Ellis said. “You post on Instagram a picture you’ve spent time on, [while on] Snapchat you post if you’re doing something cool. But they’re not about what you’re doing right now, or if you want to go do something with your friends.”
The team learned early on that building from the ground up is a challenge. After a wave of initial enthusiasm, user growth stagnated. An exciting moment came, however, when Packup was picked up by Science, Inc., an incubator located in Santa Monica, Calif. that supports promising startups.
“Before it was just an idea. We would meet up on campus at night and work on it,” O’Grady said. “But getting a term sheet and our first outside funding from the incubator brought us to the next level and gave us a big resurge in energy.”
Additionally, the group has ambitious goals in their experiments with virtual reality. Though they are starting small with 360-degree photography, they hope to eventually graduate to full-on, immersive and three-dimensional experiences in collaboration with Google Cardboard or other VR headsets.
“We’re trying to focus on creating a go-to platform for virtual reality, where people can meet up with their friends through VR and do things together,” Kaminski said. “Next month, we’ll have standard VR photos where you can pan around the photos, see it from 360 degrees.”
Throwing all their energy and efforts into Packup, the developers hope that the app will become successful enough to turn into a full-time job after college.
“I’d really like to see Packup take off and become something people really value when using their phone,” Kaminski said. “It’d be really satisfying not to have to look for a job after college, just start working on something full-time that had originally been just a side project.”

From career development workshops to skill-building seminars, USC’s Applied Statistics Club brings data science and statistics to campus. The club provides guidance and additional educational resources to around 100 USC students who are interested in this rapidly developing field of study.
Founded in Fall 2013, this student organization, which is open to students of all majors and years, prides itself on being a platform upon which students can begin or advance their studies in statistics. ASC hosts numerous events throughout the year, including networking events and recruiting sessions.
The organization also invites guest speakers who are experts in the field to share their experience working as professionals outside of a university setting.
One of the last speakers invited to ASC was Louis Cialdella. Cialdella spoke to the members of the club about the work experience and knowledge he obtained working as a member of the analytics team for ZipRecruiter, an online employment agency.
Students learned about his educational background, his role in the company and some of the challenges the analytics team faces at ZipRecruiter.
“The ZipRecruiter guest shared a lot of his personal tips for students, not only about data science but in general for college students about to start their career,” said Hang Hang, the president of ASC.
Students also examined case studies about the common issues that data science professionals face on a daily basis. Cialdella discussed the best types of statistical models and how to accurately present the results.
When guest speakers are not presenting, the experienced members of the executive board at ASC conduct workshops for the other members on a weekly basis. The board teaches students how to program in R and use software programs JMP and Excel.
“As an applied mathematics major, there are a lot of roads that I can possibly go down, so ASC enables me to test out what I want to do in my future,” said Rebecca Block, a freshman majoring in applied and computational mathematics. “By being in this type of a club, I am left to experiment with data analysis.”
ASC members also attend numerous conferences and competitions. Last year, ASC hosted a one-day event in collaboration with Paramount Pictures. The company provided participants with a data set, and students were asked to determine the effectiveness of the promotion of given movies over social media.
They worked in teams and spent the day analyzing the data to reach a conclusion. Students also provided their own insight on what Paramount should do in the future.
A panel of eight judges, who already work for Paramount analyzing data sets, assessed the students’ findings.
“ASC to me means innovation and keeping up with the world,” said Grace Xu, a freshman majoring in business administration. “In the current world, big data is ever-expanding because literally everything we do can be viewed as data, and companies are finally starting to realize it.”

USC played some of its finest basketball on both ends of the floor as it came away with a blowout 87-64 victory over Washington State Wednesday night at the Galen Center in a bounceback game for the Trojans after a devastating loss to Arizona State on Sunday.
After opening the game on a 22-7 run that was capped with a 3-point field goal from freshman guard Jonah Mathews, USC did not take its foot off the gas pedal offensively for the remainder of the contest.
With its 25-point rout of the Cougars, the Trojans were able to put an end to a brutal four-game losing streak that had spanned the past two weeks. Wednesday night’s victory over Washington State was also USC’s 22nd win of the regular season. It’s the first 22-win season since 2009.
“We played really well on both ends of the ball. We were able to get deflections and that led to buckets and good passing in transition,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “It’s been nice to see our team begin to shoot the ball better over the past couple of games now.”

USC opened the game by hitting five of its first eight shots from beyond the 3-point arc. Overall, the Trojans finished Wednesday night shooting 35-for-66 from the floor (53 percent).
Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin brought arguably his finest performance of the regular season thus far, finishing the game with 16 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, a rebound shy of his first career triple-double.
“We tried to focus all week on playing good defense, and we were able to lock down tonight,” McLaughlin said. “We did a good job of sticking to the game plan.”
The Trojans were able to find favorable shot selection all night due to their ability to make the extra pass for the easy bucket. USC finished the game with 25 assists.
McLaughlin contributed to the Trojans’ fast start offensively, as he hit his first three 3-point shot attempts of the game.
The Trojans’ largest lead of the game came after a jumper from junior guard Elijah Stewart put the Trojans ahead 70-42 with 12:29 remaining in the game.
Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu put pressure down low for the Trojans, finishing the game with 15 points (6-of-12 shooting), nine rebounds and three blocks defensively.
As a unit, the Trojans were able to put on a strong defensive effort as they finished the game with nine steals and seven blocks.
“It was definitely one of our top [performances in] games played this season,” McLaughlin said. “As far as our team having a sense of urgency, we knew that we really needed to focus for tonight’s game.”
USC’s ability to capitalize upon Washington State’s offensive miscues in the first half helped the Trojans develop their large halftime lead. USC scored 17 points off of the Cougars 11 first-half turnovers.
The Trojans committed only two turnovers offensively in the entire first half.
USC’s combination of scrappy defense, efficient offense and solid transitional play helped them develop a comfortable 48-28 lead at the half.
The Trojans kept the pressure on Washington State offensively to finish the game, as they shot 17-for-30 (56.7 percent) from the floor in the second half.
USC will look to keep its hot shooting going as it concludes its regular season at home this Saturday with a contest against visiting Washington. With Pac-12 Tournament play and NCAA Selection Sunday all transpiring within the next two weeks, USC will attempt to use Saturday’s contest against the Huskies as a springboard into postseason play.
“I told the guys that we are playing a two-game season right now,” Enfield said. “We won the first game and now we have a one-game season to be played Saturday. We’ve had by far the toughest schedule in the Pac-12. We’ve played the top-three teams twice, so it’s definitely nice to have our last two games being played at home.”

Finishing off their season with an overall record of 14-15 and 5-13 in conference play, the No. 9 seeded women’s basketball team will head to the KeyArena in Seattle to take on No. 8 seed Cal in its first game of the Pac-12 Tournament on Thursday.
“We’re excited,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “Dropped a couple of tough games against the Arizonas, but we are excited for the tournament and to kind of start at 0-0 and come in with some focus and intensity and take it one game at a time.”
As the second time this year that the Trojans will face the Bears, this game is a chance not only to advance in the tournament, but also for redemption after a tough loss.
In their last meeting, junior forward Kristen Simon was the only Trojan to score in double digits compared to the four players for Cal.
“We know that Cal is well-coached and athletic, so a very talented team,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We know Anigwe, we know their 3-point shooting, their transition flow. We have got to rebound the ball, we have got to make sure we aren’t starting their fast breaks with our turnovers and we just have to finish games better.”

Since that game though, the Trojans have come a long way. Freshman guard Minyon Moore, who was just named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, started off the season strong and has continued to improve. She has become the team leader in steals, assists and free throws and is second in rebounding and scoring behind Simon.
Moore’s aggressive style of play and average of 11.8 points per game has earned her recognition as one of the top 12 players to watch for this tournament according to Pac-12 analysts. She may never have been in the tournament before, but her contributions will be key to shutting down Cal’s dominant scorers, converting their turnovers into points and helping USC move forward in the tournament.
Aided by contributions from Moore, Simon will have to contain Cal’s Kristine Anigwe while also playing around her tough defense on the other end of the court. It will be no easy feat, as Anigwe has 14 double-doubles this season, but Simon proved in their last meeting that she can outscore her and keep up with her in rebounding.
With Simon holding down the key, the guard play will be allowed more freedom because Cal will need to account for both positions’ scoring abilities and will be forced to stretch the floor on defense.
For Simon and senior guard Courtney Jaco, this is not their first time in the tournament. In fact, Jaco was one of the few members of the current team that was part of USC’s championship victory in 2014 in their upset over Oregon State in the final.
It was a year when the Trojans were the last team picked to win, but they brought home the conference trophy despite their low seeding.
Last year, with a similar seeding, USC lost to Oregon State in the quarterfinals in a game many viewed as the alternate version of the previous year’s final. This year, if the Trojans can get past Cal, they will take on Oregon State yet again.
USC will face off against Cal on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. at the KeyArena in Seattle.

It’s finally baseball season again, and that marks the return of many great spectacles: Clayton Kershaw’s superhuman pitching, Mike Trout’s one-man show in Anaheim, Jose Altuve’s pint-sized dominance and, most importantly, around-the-clock sports — starting with those 10 a.m. matinees scheduled from Monday through Sunday.
It’s also a season of new hopes: championship aspirations, blue-chip prospects, free agent stars and… Tim Tebow.
Oh, right. The former Heisman-winning quarterback is now a 29-year-old farmhand in the New York Mets organization. He arrived in Port St. Lucie, Fla. on Monday for the start of spring training, and he brought the usual media circus with him, despite the fact that he didn’t even receive a non-roster invite to the Mets’ major league camp. Though he will likely appear in very few games, Tebow may end up being the most closely monitored New York prospect this month.
It’s bizarre. On one hand, Tebow is, by definition, a prospect in just his first full season of professional baseball. But he’s also less than six months from his 30th birthday, and his top claims to fame are his religious outspokenness and his abomination of a throwing motion — which Tebow somehow parlayed into two National Championships at Florida and a single, divine playoff victory with the Denver Broncos. To almost any sports fan, Tebow’s presence on a baseball diamond makes even less sense than his exploits on the gridiron.
But that’s also why I’m excited to see what the man can do in his rookie campaign. Scores of sports pundits loved to shout that Tebow had no business quarterbacking at the NFL level. Yet he turned around a floundering Broncos team in just his second pro campaign, guiding them to the playoffs after taking over as the starter five games into the season — all while chucking the pigskin like an Olympic javelin toss.
So why can’t Tebow defy the odds in baseball as well? Tebow’s entire athletic career to date has defied convention: He was homeschooled while quarterbacking in Ponte Vedra, Fla., he had an NCAA rule named after him at Florida (where he occasionally roomed with double-murderer Aaron Hernandez on road trips) and he went from quarterback to punt protector and then back to quarterback in the NFL. And now he’s a baseball player, naturally following a brief stint as a TV analyst.
I’m not saying he’ll look pretty swinging the bat or shagging balls in the outfield — and evidence already suggests he won’t (he face-planted into the left-field wall in the Arizona Fall League while running after a fly ball). Nevertheless, he flashes potential. Tebow reportedly grooved a 450-foot home run while he was in high school. He had a .286 average last year in instructional league play, and though he hit .194 over 19 games in the AFL (where major league clubs send their top prospects during the winter), that was after working his way out of a 0-for-13 start.
Hovering around the Mendoza Line in the minor leagues would not be a cause for hype for almost every single baseball player on the planet, but that isn’t the case for Tebow. Time and time again, he’s shown that all he needs are those brief flashes to set the sporting world on fire. He knuckled throws all over the field in January 2012 before unleashing an inexplicably perfect, 80-yard dart to Demaryius Thomas in overtime to beat Pittsburgh.
That win came to be known as the “3:16 Game,” in reference to Tebow’s famous “John 3:16” eye black during the 2009 National Championship game (which references a famous Bible verse). Tebow finished the game with a career-high 316 passing yards and 31.6 yards per completion. The Nielsen ratings peaked at 31.6, the Steelers possessed the ball for 31 minutes and six seconds and Ben Roethlisberger threw his only interception of the game on 3rd and 16.
In the aftermath, 43 percent of people responding to a survey believed that Tebow was winning with the help of divine intervention.
NFL teams never got over Tebow’s mechanics, so he never got a chance to become the league’s resident miracle worker. Baseball is different, though — somewhere his bizarre but gifted physical tools can thrive, largely as they instinctively exist. Unique windups and strange swings are scattered all around the major leagues, and they are largely tolerated, as long as you are productive in some fashion and stay healthy.
Of course, this isn’t to say Tebow doesn’t need to polish his skills; judging by his 20 strikeouts in 71 fall league at-bats, he needs to do so badly. But his raw power is enough to translate to some chance of major-league value.
You may doubt Tebow’s chances: Many frequently do, and I might be on that boat, too. He played in a well-oiled system and under an excellent coach in Urban Meyer as a Gator, and he threw the ball into the turf or into the seats more often that he hit a receiver’s hands in Denver.
But to be honest, doesn’t that make his significant resume all the more miraculous? He left Gainesville as one of the most decorated college football players ever, with five NCAA, 14 SEC and 28 Florida records. He actually also owns six Broncos franchise records, though that includes number of times sacked in one game.
I don’t know if Tim Tebow will succeed in Major League Baseball. He likely won’t even make it there. But at every level he has competed athletically, he has consistently pulled off the unbelievable. Why would you bet against him this time?
More importantly, why would you want to?

Even though the men’s volleyball team had their winning streak snapped after losing to Long Beach State last week, the team upset three top-ranked teams in the last four games. Those upsets have gone far in establishing the Trojans’ national standing, earning the team their first ranking at No. 14 this season.
The Trojans look to add another upset to their list as they take on No. 4 Hawaii in back-to-back games on Thursday and Friday in a road matchup.
“[Hawaii is] doing everything well,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “They are playing good volleyball. Categorically, if you look at the stats, they are near the top in every category: blocking, serving, side out, opponent side out. They are just doing a lot at a high level, which means we have to perform at a high level in order to contend with that.”
While taking on a top team that looks to continue its 11-match winning streak is already a challenge, the Trojans will have to deal with overcoming injuries as well.
Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder, who is currently leading the nation in kills and points, did not play in the last game due to an abdominal strain. Sophomore outside hitter Gianluca Grasso has missed four games with an ankle sprain but showed signs of recovery as he played in the final set last week.
However, it is uncertain whether either will be able to contribute on the court in these two games.
“It is a TBD kind of thing,” Nygaard said. “I mean Lucas was taken off the court for a shorter period of time, but I am hoping he is ready to go. We will see what Gianluca’s ankle looks like.”
With or without the two starters, the Trojans not only will be playing two nights in a row, but will also be facing the same team at their opponent’s home court.
However, only the first game will count as an MPSF match. The second game will serve as a friendly, but could turn into a redemption match should the Trojans lose the first bout with Hawaii.
“The positive is the second night out, there are no surprises,” Nygaard said. “You’ve already seen the game plan and it is already fresh in their head, so it is more of a few tweaks here, watch some video and reaffirm the things we want to do and go back out. It becomes a little more about heart at that point because you are going to be a little bit tired two nights in a row. ”

Korean artist Juri Hwang’s latest project is an imaginative installation. Hwang, a PhD student studying media arts and practice, used her experience as a multimedia artist to create audiovisual elements that create a strong thematic impression in her latest installation Nightfield.
Due to her professional experiences in Los Angeles, Berlin and Dolsan, Hwang’s art, according to her website, lies “at the intersection of documentary and fiction.”
Her past creations encompass collaborative and solo projects, ranging from video work on theorist Albert Einstein to a case study on an extraordinary boy undergoing life-changing procedures. Her work draws not only on ideas embedded within the mechanics of science, but also on abstract concepts from deep within the human psyche.
The initially unassuming exhibit Nightfield is much more than what meets the eyes and ears. Seventy-two strips of white hanji, a traditional paper derived from mulberry trees once used for doors and now for art, are suspended in the air by wires. These wires emit vibrations that sound similar to wind blowing through a forest.
Each strip has a different sound due to the varying densities of the hanji paper, ranging from the strong winds that weave through trees to the groaning stomach of a ghost.
The papers cycle through the sounds; during some intervals, nothing can be heard, and at others, the volume noticeably increases as the audience listens.
As far as subjectivity goes, Nightfield can be interpreted based on the viewer’s personal experiences with nature, yet the work also touches on an overarching theme.
“There is something that generally everyone shares as a human being — this wind sound that touches me from very early on — there must be some reason [for it],” Hwang said. “For me it is a very personal memory, and it may evoke the same idea in others.”
The title comes from a concept that humans are inside while experiencing the outside in their associations with nature. Similar to her concept with wind, Hwang mentioned that the ocean is another aspect of nature most people relate to, but their feelings about it varies.
Sound and subjectivity · Korean artist Juri Hwang fuses the past, present and the senses in her sound installation Nightfield. The auditory work was inspired by Hwang’s childhood experiences in Korea – Jessica Magana | Daily Trojan
Though this installation appealed immensely to the auditory senses, the experience was ultimately visceral. Viewers were encouraged by Hwang to hold the pieces of fabric up to their ears and to press them against their faces. They then become participants, interacting with the installation and ultimately becoming part of the art itself. Hwang  often focuses her artwork on the auditory senses, as opposed to visual or tactile senses.
“Ears are constant, you cannot close them,” she said.
She believes that viewers have a less conscious understanding of how they process sound. Hwang notes that humans become acquainted with sounds in the womb, and she addresses the profound impact it has on human development — audio’s strength is often overshadowed by its omnipresence.
“These sounds of nature bring an involuntary awareness of the outside world,” Hwang said.
The outside world she refers to  is the white noise that people are immune to, since it constantly surrounds them.
Nightfield, however, goes beyond prompting one to become aware of the outside — it encourages its audience to become aware of what is within themselves. Though this installation was inspired greatly by Hwang’s own childhood memories in Korea and how she remembers, she also believes that there are essential aspects that human beings can relate to.
“We react to certain things a similar way … Generally, there is something we all share as human beings,” Hwang said.
Her work not only exudes Jungian ideas of the personal and collective unconscious, but also focuses and thrives on the dance between the two.
Though the sounds of wind in her installation may bring nature to the mind of one viewer, fear and isolation could also be interpreted by a different viewer.
On view at the School of Cinematic Arts until March 3, Nightfield is sure to captivate attendees and offer an organic experience, one both shared and personal.

LySandra Ann Vuong | Daily Trojan
I found Marissa Honda in a state of frazzled disbelief. She’d just turned in the final draft of one of her Doctor of Musical Arts capstone projects, and it was beginning to dawn on her that her long career at USC has drawn down to its final few months.
Honda, an oboist, said that over the course of her three degrees at USC, she’s become only more certain of her identity as a musician — and of the power that music holds.
“Now is a really important time to be a musician in terms of political and global turmoil,” Honda said. “Knowing the power of the arts is something that’s important for all of us — to realize and to make a part of our education.”
It’s fitting that Honda’s final paper for her doctoral field in music teaching and learning was a study of how college music students’ beliefs about their craft and their musical identity affects the way they approach their career after they graduate. Honda said most of the existing literature on music and identity focuses on young children and how music can boost their self-esteem. But Honda has turned her focus to college music majors.
“I get fascinated with the idea that when students graduate, they go through this inner turmoil: ‘Should I become a musician?’” Honda said.
I asked her to tell me about her research findings.
“In my reading of research on identity, the most successful ones are the ones that have identities that are resilient — that come from a holistic knowledge of the power of music, essentially,” Honda said. “If all you know is being really good at your instrument, that’s not a very resilient identity, because it’s very subjective. It can be a roller coaster: One day you feel good about your playing, and the next you don’t.”
She added that musicians who believe that music is more than simply a skill tend to be willing to stick it out and devote themselves fully to music — even when their bank accounts and calendars are empty.
“If you have an understanding of how music affects people in your community who aren’t musicians or who are underprivileged in various ways, that builds up a resilience for why you are a musician as opposed to just doing the activity,” Honda said.
Honda has personal experience with this idea, too. After finishing her master’s, she decided to spend a year trying to make it as a freelance musician in Los Angeles and quickly realized she was up against a lot. Honda emphatically told me that learning to embrace failure has been an essential part of her musical journey, and she wishes musicians would discuss the challenges of being a professional musician more openly.
As Honda began to gain her footing in the L.A. freelance scene, she found herself gaining a sense of purpose in her playing. She began to appreciate the urgency of every gig. And so, after spending a year on her own, Honda decided she was ready to come back to school, newly armed with the diligence and focus she practiced as a freelancer.
“In terms of my education, this degree has felt the most fulfilling, but also the most difficult. I think when you go to grad school, particularly at the doctoral level, you feel like there’s a lot at stake because you’ve invested all this time — and in a lot of cases a lot of money — in your education,” Honda said.
For her DMA, Honda has pursued elective fields in arts leadership and music teaching and learning. With that perspective, Honda said she hopes to combine freelance work while teaching young people about the joy and power of music after she graduates.
“I’m applying for college jobs, a few full-time jobs and a few adjunct teaching jobs, all over the world, “ Honda said. “I’m aware that there’s a long road ahead of me!”
But before she can do that, she still has a few capstone projects left to complete. One of them is a recorded album of music on the English horn, the oboe’s misunderstood cousin. Neither a horn nor English, the English horn is a woodwind, like the oboe, but pitched a fifth below. With a robust bulb at its bell end that tapers to a slender double reed, the English horn looks vaguely like a piece of petrified kelp.
I asked Marissa to introduce this underappreciated instrument, and she played a moving solo excerpt from the Largo movement of Dvorak’s New World Symphony. (Readers of this column may recall the Largo as the piece that was playing when tubist Jimmy Elder was born.) Marissa then unpacked the English horn’s convoluted etymology.
“A word used often to describe the English horn sound is ‘yearning,’” Honda said. “Or, the original Middle High German translation of
engellisches horn means ‘angelic horn,’ so it’s associated with angels. The other translation, though, is ‘angled.’ But it’s not English. It’s just a bad translation. And it’s arguably not even a horn.”
Honda’s capstone recording will be a performance of arrangements of music that have never been recorded on the English horn before. To prepare for it, she’s had to mine archival sources for obscure pieces and adapt new arrangements of works for other instruments so that she can play them on her angelic horn.
Though finishing school is bittersweet, Honda said that the academic legwork she’s put into her DMA has only strengthened her musical identity.
“I think my resilience as a musician — as a performer, a holistic musician, comes from the fact that I did my education at a very holistically academic place” Honda said. “It’s a full university, which is not uncommon, but I think it’s uncommon to have a conservatory level music program so closely associated with a university.”
Honda plans to release her English horn project as a finished album this summer.

Even on a Tuesday night in the midst of midterms, students began to trickle into Tommy’s Place at 10 p.m., eager for Spoiler Alert’s weekly improv show. When the house lights finally dimmed, the eight members of the troupe ran onstage to raucous applause.
Having gleaned from the audience only the genre (romantic comedy) and title (Bushels of Bandits in Love) of the TV show they were about to enact, the actors proceeded to engage in an hour-long love story between two opposing crime syndicates — a dramatic saga that involved betrayal, heartbreak, intrigue and murder.
Spoiler Alert was founded in 2011, making it one of the younger improv troupes on campus. The group focuses on their signature long-form and short-form episode format, where the players assume characters in a TV show whose name and genre is determined by the audience’s whims. The “episode” is periodically interrupted by short-form “commercial breaks.” Their format is unique; no other troupe follows this setup. Kim Rogers, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism, appreciates how plot-driven improv allows for more in-depth character exploration than just games and sketches.
“We really like to dive into the relationships between characters. It’s also fun for us when we’re doing episodes to play on movie and TV tropes,” Rogers said. “I think it makes it fun for the audience because they see archetypes that they recognize, but silly and made-up.”
The current troupe leader is Cameron Gavinski, a junior majoring in animation and theatre, who often takes the reins during the performance and addresses the audience, soliciting suggestions that the players are forced to run with. His first exposure to Spoiler Alert occurred, incidentally, while he hadn’t yet even matriculated at USC.
“I first joined my freshman year, and I’ve been the leader for about two-and-a-half years now,” Gavinski said. “When I visited for Explore USC, the prior leader of Spoiler Alert was on a panel and she was saying what she was doing, and I thought she was so cool. I wanted to come to USC and do the exact same thing she was doing and now I am.”
While other, more established troupes may give off an air of intimidation, Spoiler Alert makes a conscious effort to remain open, warm and friendly. Chris Tennant, a junior majoring in film and television production, auditioned for several different improv troupes, but felt his nerves dissipating during the Spoiler Alert tryouts.
“I felt during the audition process that Spoiler Alert had the most welcoming atmosphere. When they were watching us audition it felt like they wanted us to succeed, they wanted to have fun with us,” Tennant said. “The audition process can be scary and we try to be open to people at all levels who love improv.”
Despite its status as a relative newcomer to the USC improv scene, Spoiler Alert has already cultivated a small but devoted group of fans who ensure that they never miss a single performance. Aly Ferguson, a junior majoring in narrative studies, caught her first show at the beginning of the year and has been a fixture in the audience ever since.
“I really like improv, and Spoiler Alert is really funny,” Ferguson said. “I came to one of their shows and I liked their format, which to my knowledge the other troupes don’t do.”
Being a part of Spoiler Alert is a hefty commitment; in addition to the Tuesday shows, rehearsals take place three times a week, for a total of 10 to 12 hours devoted to the group. The troupe also hosts weekly improv workshops called “Improvtu,”  that allow anyone to join in on the fun on Friday evenings. Despite the intense schedule, however, the experience remains incredibly rewarding for members.
“Every week I laugh more than I’ve ever laughed in my life before. Now I’m best friends with the funniest people I know, and it is so rewarding and fulfilling,” Gavinski said. “I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”

That is the chilling question that Sunayana Dumala, the widow of Indian immigrant Srinivas Kuchibhotla, posed on Facebook after her husband was murdered at a bar in Kansas. The shooter, Adam Purinton, yelled “terrorist” and “get out of my country,” according to witnesses, after questioning the immigration status of Kuchibhotla and his friend, Alok Madasani, who was wounded when Purinton opened fire.
The layers of ignorance are almost comical. That Purinton conflated anyone’s heritage with their ability to be a “terrorist” deeply contradicts modern realities of terrorism. But that Purinton also conflated the immigrants’ Indian heritage with, to borrow a phrase from President Donald Trump, “radical Islamic terrorism” is also absurdly inaccurate, seeing as Hindu-dominant India has been in conflict with nearby Muslim-dominant countries for centuries. But, it turns out, Purinton hadn’t even realized the two men were Indian at all; a 911 call placed by a bartender at Applebee’s, where Purinton confessed to his crime, revealed that Purinton had thought he had shot two “Iranian” people.
Purinton’s narrative is clear: All brown people — Iranians, Indians, Muslims and others — are the same. They are all terrorists. And, according to Purinton, their identities should cost them their lives.
The attack has shaken the Indian community, and the Indian American community, to its core. Even as some white Americans have grown paranoid of Islam in recent years, Indian Americans have always taken solace in the idea that if they kept their heads down, they would be OK. But not anymore.
Scores of editorials in Indian newspapers urged the Trump administration to break its silence on the issue by condemning the attack and the rise of racial hatred in the United States. And Sarah Sanders, a White House spokesperson, did condemn the attack on Tuesday. The FBI is also investigating the incident as a hate crime.
“As more facts come to light and it begins to look like this was an act of racially motivated hatred,” Sanders said in a statement. “I want to reiterate the President condemns these or any other racially or religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country.”
Even though Trump has said nothing, it is certainly telling that the White House — notorious for doubling down in the face of controversy — condemned this attack when it has been so unwilling to condemn other racially motivated attacks. Those words do not go unnoticed.
And yet they ring so hollow.
At his first speech to Congress last night, Trump invited the families of people who have been killed by undocumented immigrants. In a vicious attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the decision on Facebook.
“[L]et’s be clear about what Donald Trump is doing tonight in inviting family members who saw a loved one murdered by an undocumented immigrant. He is stirring up fear and hatred against immigrants and trying to divide our nation,” Sanders said. “Why didn’t Trump invite the family of Srinvas [sic] Kuchibhotla, the immigrant from India, who was recently shot down in cold blood by a white, native born American? Didn’t his life count?”
Even though Trump can pay lip service by sending a spokesperson to “condemn” racial attacks, he has not taken responsibility for his part in creating them. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Trump’s “incendiary rhetoric” is directly responsible for the near-tripling of hate groups over the past year. Additionally, according to Bloomberg, the New York Police Department reported a spike in hate crimes between election day last year and Feb. 19. It is clear that a rise in hate crimes are a clear consequence of the Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies emboldening racists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis to forward a nationalist agenda that comes at the expense of people of nearly all other ethnicities.
That is not the America that Indian immigrants — from Google CEOs to Nobel Prize recipients to people just trying to make a better life for their families — look up to. That is not the America that Indian immigrants — who make up 70 percent of H1-B visas, and so many of whom are accepted to enter the United States because of their expertise in the technology sector — raise their children to look up to. And it is certainly not the idea of the American Dream that Indian immigrants — many of whom come from humble beginnings and live their lives by the mantra of hard work and scholarship — have been sold.
Indian Americans now face an identity crisis guided by fears for their safety. It draws too many parallels to those of their Muslim, black and brown brothers and sisters.
So now, Indian Americans — a minority group that is often silent in political activism — must join the resistance against racial and religious hatred. The tragic loss of Kuchibhotla demonstrates that when xenophobia and racism are perpetuated against one group, ignorance is all-pervasive, and it carries fatal consequences. The only winners are white supremacists.
What, specifically, has President Trump said that is racist?

Last week, the Trump administration officially revoked federal guidelines granting transgender students the right to use public school restrooms corresponding with their gender identities. The Obama administration previously advocated for and actively enforced these guidelines.
As a result of the Education and Justice Departments’ latest stance, we can expect states across the nation to continue to legally undermine transgender students’ dignities and civil rights and ultimately, transform public schools into sites of institutionalized bullying — all encouraged by our current president.
And while Press Secretary Sean Spicer claimed the decision was made because such guidelines “lacked extensive legal analysis, did not go through a public vetting process, sowed confusion and drew legal challenges,” lawmakers who oppose trans bathroom rights are too often guided by paternalistic notions of protecting cisgender women and girls, who are cast as defenseless victims of transgender monsters, and wholly dependent on straight, cisgender male lawmakers to come to their rescue.
The root of opposition to transgender individuals using the restroom of their gender identity lies in stereotypes of transgender individuals as predatory perverts that young, cis women must be rescued from.
But that being said, if the goal of anti-trans lawmakers is, indeed, to protect young women and not merely to demonize transgender students, conservative lawmakers would pay more attention to all of the cases of campus sexual harassment and violence toward women. This includes all sexual harassment and violence toward women committed by cisgender men, who constitute the vast majority of perpetrators in cases of sexual abuse against women.
While there are virtually zero recorded cases of cisgender women and girls being preyed on by transgender women in restrooms, as a matter of public record, there exists no shortage whatsoever of cisgender women being preyed upon by cisgender men in public facilities.
Statistically speaking, if we forced transgender women to use men’s restrooms in public, it is far more likely that they would be the victimized party. According to a 2016 NPR report, trans individuals are more likely to be the victims of sexual abuse in bathrooms than their cisgender counterparts. In fact, according to national data, you’re more likely to be harassed or assaulted in a bathroom by a cis Republican man than by a transgender woman, which isn’t too difficult to believe when one considers the myriad sexual abuse allegations against our current Republican president and his notorious penchant for sneaking backstage at beauty pageants to gawk at naked young women.
Yet these plainly objective facts stay excluded from the rhetoric and policy proposals of conservatives.
If anti-trans lawmakers genuinely cared about the violence women and girls continue to face, they would devote their efforts to reforming laws governing sexual assault survivors’ rights; they would promote increased education and awareness about consent, and actively work to establish a culture of respect toward women — not infantilize them in order to promote an ignorant, transparently transphobic narrative.
The Trump administration’s decision on transgender rights in public facilities is particularly unsettling because it directly affects the millions of youths, transgender or not, attending public schools across the country. As if the everyday anxiety of being included, making friends and fitting in doesn’t impact transgender students’ academic performances enough already, I can only imagine how inability to safely use the restroom they feel most comfortable in without being bullied and harassed will further disrupt this equation.
These discriminatory policies in public schools benefit no one — least of all the young cis women lawmakers claim to be looking out for — and only serve to instill hostility and disdain for the transgender community in America’s youth at their most impressionable stage in life.
It’s frustrating that young women are being reduced to mere pawns while their rights to bodily autonomy, reproductive healthcare, workplace equality and protection from sexual abuse perpetuated by cis men are either ignored or overtly attacked by conservative lawmakers. It’s also deeply telling that conservative lawmakers exclude trans women from the bloc of women they believe are worthy of respect and protection.
At the end of the day, conservative lawmakers will continue to undermine the humanity of a whole demographic of Americans, and shame, misrepresent and humiliate trans youth. Data and research disproving the narrative that transgender people are sexual predators unfailingly fall upon deaf ears, as conservative lawmakers continue to push their agenda solely on the basis of staunch, unyielding prejudice. But at the very least, they can leave cis women and girls out of this. We never signed up to be used for, and certainly don’t stand to benefit from, transphobia.

Please don’t say you stand up for the left… even this is too far for me. Feminist garbage. 
Stop the fake rhetoric. There is literally no such thing as “transgender”. One can not change their gender. One can dress in drag, change their name, change their behaviour… but can not change their gender. We express ourselves sexually in a number of ways, across a broad spectrum… but gender remains binary and is not subject to the whims of a modern generation. YOU ARE IN COLLEGE WHERE SCIENCE SHOULD BE TAUGHT AND RESPECTED, NOT TRASHED. We already have plenty of laws and regulations against bullying and harassment on the books. These laws provide protections against bullying and harassment of anyone, including people who suffer from gender identity issues. No need for more laws, no need for special rights, and certainly no need to indulge people with lies. Reminding people of science and truth is not mean, or harsh, or “alt-Right” or “non-inclusive”. It’s actually the kindest thing you can do. The rights of the 99% of normal, healthy people who do not suffer this disorder should not be trampled by false science or alternative facts. Reasonable accommodations for the handicapped is fair; Trashing science is not reasonable. Thanks. We’re done here. Go back to class.

Earlier this month at the “Immigrants Make America Great” march, protesters joined together in chanting “Not My President” for another round of demonstrations. However, the event remains overshadowed by what happened last month when protesters at UC Berkeley prevented a speaking engagement by right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, known for identifying African Americans as “apes,” comparing feminism to “cancer” and formerly endorsing pedophilia.
On Inaugration Day, many purportedly anti-Trump rioters, who, according to some reports, were merely anarchists with no political affiliation, blocked roads, threw bricks, smashed car windows, and set a Muslim man’s limousine on fire and damaged stores.
Bearing in mind the lack of rationality in these actions, compare these protesters with those from the Women’s March on Jan. 21, which was civil and orderly. While the former portrays an emotional overreaction targeted toward one man, the latter demonstrates a rational response to injustice.
One group allowed their outrage to get the best of them while the other made a careful effort to be peaceful. Should a time for protesting come to USC, there is a better way to assemble — one that won’t be nearly as embarrassing as some of the violent protests that have taken place so far.
An allegory may help to define what rational and emotional responses are: the USC versus UCLA rivalry. Every time the Trojans defeat the Bruins — which is gloriously often — it adds to the personal patriotism of students here. But in searching for the main reason why this mostly lighthearted school rivalry exists, there is no clear rational explanation. It’s an emotional response to feel good every time cardinal and gold shirts take the football field, to feel extra displeasure when a car with a UCLA license plate frame rudely changes lanes without signaling.
Ultimately, there is no rational reason to dislike the school across town, given the fact that UCLA is simply an excellent school. The side that mocks the other better or cheers louder isn’t going to result in higher rankings in U.S. News and World Report. The emotional display of competition between USC and UCLA is all in good fun.
But at some point, many Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators breached the invisible line of civility that protected the sanctity of the right to assemble. UC Berkeley’s Daily Californian published a letter to the editor recently that makes an excellent point: “It’s a cop-out to blame deplorables for Trump and not realize that we are all part of a society that relies on the oppression of the weakest for the relative comfort of others.”
But those who don’t realize this decide on alternative, emotional methods of assembling — the violent protest. By doing so, those who claim to be progressives and “fighting for equality” do a disservice to the respectable platform of the Democratic Party. Protests shouldn’t be raging overreactions to a single individual and descend into chaos. That’s not a protest. Whenever any group breaks the sacred line between lawful assembly and inexcusable rioting, they disrespect everyone who stands for a free society.
For USC students who had no further thoughts on the election other than frustration and anger, don’t let emotions overcome your rational sense of being. The emotional side of a liberal may want to call every Trump supporter an idiot. The rational side would say to trust in the interlocking system of federalism and remain calm. Emotions may guide someone to throw bricks at windows in resentment of the inauguration. Rational thinking says that those are innocent businesses that had nothing to do with the election.
The ultimate realization for all Trojans should be that they are members of academia. They are the guardians of civil society — albeit guardians-in-training. They will be depended upon to cultivate their own enlightened minds so that even when society throws the most difficult responsibilities at them, good outcomes can be expected. This can only happen when we are wise and rational.

On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump delivered his first speech to a joint session of United States Congress, which was streamed live in Wallis Annenberg Hall.
The event was hosted by the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. After the viewing of the congressional address, four panelists discussed the points made during the speech and the impact they could have on the political climate. The panel included Bob Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics; William Rodriguez Morrison, the Senate director of the California Republican Assembly; Shakari Byerly, a partner at EVITARUS Strategic Research; and Gary Aminoff, who works as a treasurer for the Los Angeles County Republican Party.
Throughout the course of the speech, Trump discussed his policies regarding the U.S. economy, healthcare, education and immigration. The speech was kicked off with the mention of Black History Month and the importance of extending efforts in terms of civil rights. The President also addressed recent bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country and the shooting of Indian men in Kansas.
After the speech, Aminoff began the conversation by saying that he liked Trump’s tone, which differed from previous speeches that appealed to a more narrow group of supporters.
“It was measured, it was not partisan, it was inclusive,” Aminoff said. “I was pleased to see the way he spoke tonight. As a fiscal conservative myself, I think a lot of it was conservative.”
Shrum argued that although the speech put forward a conservative agenda, a large part was tied to the economy and to jobs. He even questioned whether this address had brought about a new form of conservatism.
“It was a remarkably polarized chamber tonight,” Shrum said. “I don’t agree with Donald Trump on a lot of things he had to say, but I thought that was a remarkable speech given the expectations.”
Shrum went on to say that the unhappy attitudes of the Democrats seated in the House Chamber during the speech would not likely play out in their favor. This was a topic of debate during the panel, and Byerly contradicted Shrum by stating that Democrats needed to make a strong showing of how they felt.
“I think if they had seemed overly open, that may have actually played to their detriment,” Byerly said.
During the address, Trump said that 43 million people in the United States are living in poverty, and that he hopes to address this by developing policies to reduce corporate tax rates of American companies to make them more competitive.
Furthermore, Trump argued that reforming immigration would aid in restructuring the economy, and he reiterated his plans to build a wall along the Southern border of the country.
“By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone,” Trump said. “We want all Americans to succeed, but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.”
According to Aminoff, funding is the main obstacle that is likely to stand in the way of Trump delivering on his promises.
“The questions that were running through my mind were: all this infrastructure he wants to build, on the wall, on the border, all of these great programs — my question is, where is the money going to come from to pay for all of this?” Aminoff said.
Although Byerly said that she was critical of a lot of aspects of the speech, she was happy to see Trump attempting to appeal to Democrats as well as Republicans.
“I was happy to see him mentioning some issues where there was some common ground with Democrats, like childcare and paid family leave,” Byerly said. “I think those are policies where Democrats want to see progress being made.”
Shrum said that Trump thought he had to do certain things tonight in order to get approval from other people. He argued that if Trump continued to act like this, people would no longer be able to say that he can’t do his job properly, no matter how much they disagreed with him. Aminoff added that Americans should watch Trump’s actions, rather than just his words over the coming years to judge whether he is an effective leader.
“Trump loves to give shocking rhetoric; he likes to jar people,” Aminoff said. “I would pay more attention to what he does than what he says.”

The USC Environmental Student Assembly hosted a forum on the Sustainability 2020 program at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday, which updated students on the initiative’s progress thus far and provided an opportunity for questions and comments.
The event outlined the goals proposed by Sustainability 2020 and the steps that have been taken to meet them. The main speaker was Halli Bovia, program manager of USC’s Office of Sustainability.
Sustainability 2020 is a far-reaching plan aimed at mitigating USC’s overall environmental impact. Utilizing STARS, a widely recognized program designed to measure a university’s environmental footprint, USC compared its sustainability profile to peer institutions in order to gauge its strengths and weaknesses relative to other universities. The Sustainability 2020 committee then collaborated with students, faculty, administration and other stakeholders to draft a plan that will capitalize on these opportunities and eliminate shortcomings.
Some of the primary goals include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent per square foot, purchasing 20 percent of food from sustainable sources, achieving 75 percent waste diversion levels and decreasing potable water use by 25 percent, all within the next four years.
Several tangible projects have been implemented to reach these milestones, including the installation of LED lights in residence halls and apartments on and off campus, as well as stickers in restrooms that encourage using water sparingly. There is also a proposal to install solar panels on the roof of the Galen Center, which is awaiting approval from the administration.
Bovia said that she was pleased with the progress that has been made, highlighting that Sustainability 2020 is the first initiative that brings together so many different stakeholders.
“[Sustainability 2020] is the first University-wide sustainability plan,” Bovia said. “It’s the first effort that’s bringing together all the divisions of the University, and we haven’t done that before. What we’re working on next is … tightening up [our plan] and figuring out where to go next.”
She also noted the different ways Sustainability 2020 is trying to engage students who are unaware of or uninterested in the program.
“We’ve got a committee that is getting put together to work on … informational campaigns and behavior change campaigns,” Bovia said.
Megan White, a junior majoring in environmental studies and geological sciences and a member of  the USC Environmental Core, said that the administration’s slow-moving nature is one of the biggest obstacles Sustainability 2020 faces going forward.
“One of the things we need to work on the most is getting a better response from the administration,” White said. “Students can only go so far. We don’t have the funding for any of these projects we’re trying to push.”
Zachary Manta, a senior majoring in environmental studies as well as the director of the environmental core and the advisor for Sustainability Issues on the USG Advocacy Committee, said this event was important for uniting sustainability efforts across campus and promoting greater coordination between these groups.
“I think this event was really important to have to open up the dialogue between everybody and reach across the different departments and groups at USC,” Manta said. “In order for [progress] to continually happen, I think it is really important that [the] senior administration takes [the] initiative to create a regular, centralized, funded structure that allows these initiatives to bridge the gaps they need to bridge.”

On Trousdale Parkway, students promote homelessness prevention in the L.A. area with bright, colorful posters.
These students are part of the Homelessness Action Committee, a newly formed student group working to provide services to homeless people in Los Angeles as well as raise awareness of the issue among USC students. Members of the committee have planned a second Homelessness Awareness Week this semester to follow up on the first one that took place last fall.
Angie Mendoza, a senior majoring in social sciences and NGOs and social change, heads the Homelessness Action Committee. Mendoza said the event has been helpful in raising awareness to the social issues that need to be addressed more heavily by the students at USC.
“[Our group is] building a partnership with the community,” Mendoza said. “We want everyone on campus to work together, students and faculty.”
The committee will put together various events throughout the week. Tuesday events included a hygiene kit assembly and guest speakers. On Wednesday there will be a families panel and a criminal justice panel. Thursday’s panel spotlights veterans affected by the homeless and the panel that night will focus on the Measure H campaign. The Homelessness Action Committee is also putting together a hygiene kit drive as part of their awareness week.
According to Mendoza, the Homelessness Action Committee hopes to do more than just volunteer in the community. The group also wants students to travel off campus to form a relationship with the L.A. neighborhoods. This, Mendoza said, will facilitate USC’s embrace of the community.
Jaclyn Nguyen, a senior majoring in Spanish and human biology, agreed that the issue of homelessness while working her table along Trousdale.
“There are more homeless people in Los Angeles than the student population of USC,” Nguyen said. “As a native to Los Angeles, I think that it is important we address this issue and help those in need. Homelessness can happen to anyone — if there’s anything volunteering has taught me, it’s that bad luck can hit at any time.”
Nguyen volunteers for homeless shelters in the surrounding area. She said that talking to people about their stories and how they ended up at the shelter is an enlightening experience, and emphasized that she’s met people who hold Ph.D.s living at the shelter.
Other parts of the Homelessness Action Committee use different outlets to address the issue of poverty. Late Night is a student-run, hot meal program that serves free dinner on Wednesday nights in Dean’s Cafe on campus.
Donovan Spencer, a sophomore majoring in global health and biology, plays a major role in running the Late Night program. Spencer said he started the program when he realized that some students on campus are limited by their resources.
“We dug a little deeper into the issue of students without room and board or even any form of a meal plan,” Spencer said. “Kids on campus can get really caught up in embodying the Trojan name and put all their resources into their classes and tuition, leaving little to no room for basic human needs. So Late Night gives a hot meal and provides resources and comfort to those in need.”
Spencer said that Late Night addresses a problem that for the most part goes undiscussed on campus, as many students are unaware of the struggles their peers face. Late Night hopes to help those who need help, but are too afraid to openly ask. That is why the dinners are open to everyone, according to Spencer.
“We’ve made it a point to show they have a safe space,” Spencer said. “We want all Trojans here on campus to know that they are respected, cared for and that their needs are taken care of. We want to help everyone and cooking for others is a great way to show our love for the Trojan family.”
On Wednesday afternoons, students in Late Night will grab fresh ingredients to cook dinners for that same night. Spencer emphasized the meals stray from the typical dining-hall dinners and are nutritious as well.
Amanuel Araya, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, notes the gradual increase in attendance at dinners since Late Night started, as well as the reciprocation of gratefulness from diners of Late Night.
“Some of the kids who come through are so thankful for the event that they’ll find some ways to give back to the Late Night organization,” Araya said. “They contribute what they can to make the event even better. It’s an awesome experience to be apart of.”
Mendoza said members of the Homelessness Action Committee want to see students more engaged with their surroundings. This would be aided by the passage of Measure H, which is on the ballot on March 7.
“[Measure H] would allow more encompassing services to the homeless to be provided right here in Los Angeles,” Mendoza said. “We hope that those with questions or doubts come to the panels and events provided throughout this week to hear other opinions and insights to the issues being discussed.”
