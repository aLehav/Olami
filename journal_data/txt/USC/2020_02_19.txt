Picture this: flames, riots and pitchforks. Utter chaos over a monopolized piece of political propaganda. A rival challenges a sovereign for the title of crispiest coat, toastiest bun and juiciest breast. 
That’s right, folks. I’m talking about chicken sandwiches. 
Chick-fil-A has garnered massive backlash over the past decade, stemming from its chief executive Don Cathy’s anti-LGBT remarks back in 2012 and the company’s then continual donations to Christian charities like Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes that campaign against same-sex marriage. This resulted in international boycotts and protests against their homophobic stances. 
Just recently, Chick-fil-A announced that it will no longer donate to these anti-LGBT organizations. While this discontinuation should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering the company did not rule out donating to faith-based organizations in the future,  this seems to be a positive, progressive step for the company. It will instead allocate its funds to focus on homelessness, education and hunger. 
Upon the announcement of dropping the donations, conservative leaders cried betrayal, with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee denouncing Chick-fil-A as “surrendering to anti-Christian hate groups,” with others from the right labeling it as a “backstabbing.” 
This reaction from the right emblazons the twisted, extremist Christian values that glorify religious freedom as a means to be homophobic. While Chick-fil-A and several other companies have promoted a discriminatory agenda, protesting them tends to overlook where this homophobia came from in the first place and how it continues to tear our society apart. 
To name a recent example, conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh asserted that America will not elect former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a “gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage,” as president. As Limbaugh carries considerable influence among conservative groups, these comments epitomize the blatant, direct homophobia that still occurs every day in this country. We could boycott Limbaugh like we boycotted Chick-fil-A, but his following would not waiver, and this acrimonious speech would persist. 
This just tells us that our fixation with Chick-fil-A ultimately acts as a deterrent from not only this homophobia but also the homophobia that goes over our heads every day. 
Homophobia does not only originate from religious ideology but also from the stigma around being an ally as a heterosexual man. Toxic masculinity commonly associates homosexuality with femininity and nonconformity to constructed standards of manliness. 
This is a similar problem with the modern feminist movement and the lack of meaningful straight, cis-male allyship. As with all issues of systemic oppression, there is a deficit of advocacy from the majority. Because fellas, is it gay to support basic human rights? 
Look at straight privilege too — we seldom hear of a straight couple being uncomfortable, nervous or even scared of holding hands in public. While this is not necessarily subject to discourse, the concept itself exemplifies heteronormativity and the challenges that LGBT-identifying individuals face every day. Simply protesting a company’s problematic past does not pacify this struggle. 
Not to mention the American Red Cross still requires men who have had sexual contact with other men to defer blood donation for 12 months, which is an improvement from the previous lifetime ban. Despite blood shortages, the American Red Cross still does not accept blood from gay and bisexual men without this stipulation. Protesting Chick-fil-A subverts discrimination like this for what — to politicize a chicken sandwich? Redirecting our attention to issues like this would work to diminish latent and biting homophobia and actually save lives. 
Yes, Cathy’s remarks perpetuate homophobia. Chick-fil-A donating to anti-LGBT organizations should not be condoned by any means. But if this is the way we choose to advocate for marginalized groups, we should at least reevaluate other companies that may not support the same political agenda we do. 
As a matter of fact, In-N-Out executives donate to the Republican Party and the Trump Administration. One of SoulCycle’s major investors held fundraisers for the Trump campaign. Without consistency in choosing the companies we support and giving proper attention to these other issues, boycotting Chick-fil-A is a misguided way of combating homophobia. 
At the end of the day, being an ally is of utmost importance. That being considered, we should also be mindful while speaking on behalf of a group like the LGBT community. Not every Christian is straight, and religion can be openly interpreted. We should be cautiously optimistic about Chick-fil-A and its shift away from anti-LGBT donations yet also refocus our efforts to these other forms of discrimination. 
In reality, a chicken sandwich is not dividing America — that’s on our behalf.

Spring semester is an important time for Undergraduate Student Government and student organizations as a whole. USG elects new leadership, and some of the bigger student programs put on major events, such as USC Concerts Committee’s Springfest. As it happens, the two events are far from unrelated. 
A major part of USG’s responsibilities includes setting budgets for different student organizations such as Concerts Committee, Speakers Committee, Environmental Student Assembly and many more. All of these groups are categorized under “Programming Allocations,” and, if one looks at the numbers, they will find that the budgets set for these different programs vary greatly.
USG holds a large amount of power regarding how the University spends its money. For the current academic year, USG has a budget of over $2 million. A portion of these funds goes toward student government payroll, communication services and bystander intervention training, as well as other more bureaucratic necessities.
Aside from these funds, USG put just under $1.4 million toward programming allocations for this school year. Within this amount, there are huge disparities between the budgets of different school programs. In fact, there is one program in particular that receives more funds than any other body on the list: Concerts Committee.
This year, the committee’s budget is nearly $600,000. To put this number in perspective, Speakers Committee receives the second highest amount of money from USG programming allocations at $109,000 this year. That is almost $500,000 less than the Concerts Committee’s budget. 
In fact, the Concerts Committee’s budget is greater than the combined budgets of the Latinx Student Assembly, the International Student Assembly, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, the Environmental Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Academic Culture Assembly and the Special Events Committee.
Adding to its budget, Concerts Committee is giving students the option to purchase multiple Springfest guest tickets. So on top of its budget and however many thousands of dollars go into the Springfest programming, Concerts Committee will also be bringing in money from the event. 
This begs the question: What are our priorities as a school? Yes, the events put on by  Concerts Committee are well-attended and inclusive to at least most of the USC community. But does an off-campus event that is essentially ticketed for the general public really deserve a whopping majority of USG’s funds? 
Meanwhile, student programming such as the Performing Arts Committee and Political Student Assembly each receive about 5% of what Concerts Committee receives to put on concerts with expensive, big-name artists. There is absolutely no reason that these important programs should be getting a significantly lower budget than an organization that puts on concerts. In fact, perhaps if these less-funded organizations even received just a little bit of the funding from Concerts Committee, they would be able to put on more well-attended events and raise awareness for things that are perhaps more important than a free Saweetie concert.
Of course, all students should be the ones determining how to divvy up USG’s budget. The legislative branch is made up of 12 popularly elected senators who are supposed to represent the interests of the undergraduate student body. However, about less than a quarter of undergraduate students voted in the recent USG presidential election, and even fewer turn out for senatorial elections. If students want to combat the budget inequities within student programming, then they should make it a priority to attend USG senate meetings and participate in school elections.

It’s nearly impossible to say what I’m about to say without sounding like a dramatic Luddite but so be it. Twitter is making us less creative and less original as a collective. 
Now, Twitter has bigger problems than its comedic unoriginality. In fact, one could easily argue that humor is the best that the platform has to offer or that Twitter is the go-to forum for free entertainment nowadays. 
When I criticize Twitter, I don’t mean the site can’t be funny or entertaining or useful in any sort of way. Many of us compulsively check Twitter multiple times a day because it’s entertaining. Still, there is a distinct difference between being entertaining and being creative.
Yes, creating something entertaining requires a certain level of creativity. But in our current age of mass media consumption, anything that tickles the funny bone’s even most surface-level demands is enough to get the job done.
When I say Twitter is draining our collective creativity, I’m referring to a specific phenomenon that’s existed as long as the Internet has been around but has become the norm since the explosion of social media. It’s a kind of inside joke-led Internet humor that lends itself to rewarding quips that use and lightly repurpose popular formats or slang seen on platforms like Twitter, Reddit or Instagram. It’s a type of funny predicated more on shared experience and gatekeeping than comic creativity. My mind flashes to the Vine of the guy going “haha, I do that.” And just like that, I’ve fallen victim to it, too.
I notice it when I hang out with friends. They can be really fun people; they like to laugh, and they make a lot of jokes. It’s just that most of these jokes — usually the vast majority of them — contain the same exact premises, subject matters, setups and, at times, even the same punchlines. It’s a kind of fill-in-the-blank, Mad Libs-style humor where taking the easy layup is rewarded more than thinking outside the box. Think of the commonly used “when you *blank* but *blank*” or “mood: *blank*” or “we stan a *blank* king/queen” setups. How many times do you hear these on a daily basis?
This is not a slight at meme culture or memes in general. Again, the creation of unique, entertaining content requires a certain baseline of creativity. But if we’re being truthful here, our bar for what we reward as unique or clever has been lowered as Twitter has become most Internet users’ public forum of choice.
I probably sound like an old man yelling at a cloud right now, and that’s fair. It’s just exhausting when the clever and not-so-clever jokes you used to naturally create with your friends have become increasingly derivative of social media content. The jokes pander to Twitter users, and they don’t pack the same punch or satisfaction of original material.
There’s a term in stand-up comedy called “hack” that is used to refer to comedians, writers and jokes which use unoriginal or obvious devices to generate cheap laughs. It’s using tropes that you know will guarantee laughs from a general audience because they’re widely understood, even if they’re not new, original or clever. In stand-up, topics that are considered “hack” range from airline travel to the differences between men and women to impressions of celebrities. With Twitter, the culture encourages a similar kind of “hack” that values mass appeal over originality. But because hack culture on Twitter has become so normalized, it makes it hard to criticize and even harder to change. 
It’s also worth noting how so many of these popular joke structures and themes originated on Black Twitter and LGBTQ Twitter before they became the dominant Twitter humor and, in turn, became played out. But let’s not kid ourselves, the mainstream will continue to co-opt Black and queer culture until they are the mainstream. Grass is green. Water is wet. Death, taxes and idea theft of minority populations are givens. 
But joke theft and comic hackery certainly aren’t new phenomena, and they will continue to exist as long as we keep on laughing. It’s just the way it is — it’s a hell of a lot easier to use other people’s good ideas than work to come up with your own. I’m just praying we don’t start pulling from TikTok when we try to be funny. Too late.

Watch a film, learn and eat snacks. Department of Middle East Studies aims to educate students about Persian culture and language through screenings of critically-acclaimed Iranian films. The Persian Film Series is part of the department’s Iranian Studies Initiative for Spring 2020. 
The second film in the series, “The Song of Sparrows,” directed by Majid Majidi, was Iran’s official submission to the Foreign Language Film category of the 2009 Academy Awards. The Department of Middle East Studies screened the accoladed film with English subtitles Tuesday in Taper Hall.
Last month, the department screened “Bashu, the Little Stranger” directed by Bahram Beizai, which follows a young boy violently displaced by the Iran-Iraq War. It is hailed as “The Best Iranian Film of All Time” by Persian movie magazine Picture World.
Assistant professor of Iranian Studies Hani Khafipour, who organized the event, is teaching a class called “Politics of Film and Literature in Modern Iran” this semester. The course explores contemporary Iranian society as it is reflected in Persian literature and films. 
“[Khafipour] chose all the films based upon films we had here at USC that had good themes but also that are really great for Persian language students to practice the language,” said Renee Almassizadeh, program specialist for the department of Middle East Studies. 
Although the film series was designed to complement Khafipour’s course, the screenings are open to all. In particular, students enrolled in Persian language courses are encouraged to attend.
Kaveh Mahdavi, a sophomore majoring in biology and Middle East studies, hopes that by attending these screenings, he will develop a stronger connection to his heritage.
“I really want to learn the Persian language because I’m half Persian,” Mahdavi said. “I can’t really speak it, I’m very disconnected from all that. So, something like this is just a good opportunity for me to practice.”
Mahdavi did not attend the first film in the series but learned about “The Song of Sparrows” screening from his “Persian IV” professor, Peyman Nojoumian. 
The film follows protagonist Karim as he navigates the transition from life as a rural ostrich farmer to a taxi driver in the city. With this transition comes a loss of spirituality toward an obsession with material gain, and he must learn to balance the corruption of capitalism with his community of loved ones back home. 
Mahdavi thought that although the film was “reasonable,” the character development could have been more comprehensive.
“I felt like if it spent more time showing how much of a good person he [Karim] was at the beginning, the change would have been more significant,” Mahdavi said. 
Associate professor Peyman Nojoumian, who presented the screening to students, appreciated the film’s authenticity. He found that the unique usage of amateur actors and traditional Persian music reminded him of home. 
“The actors are not so well-known,” Nojoumian said. “[Majidi] sometimes uses real families to play in the movies, and that was one of the good things. That was so natural, that his family was all together. I was able to connect with some of the scenes because I lived [in Iran] half of my life, so a lot of things for me [were] just very sensible and I could resonate with those experiences.” 
After the screening, attendees had the opportunity to speak with Nojoumian about their impressions of the film. Nojoumian highlighted the film’s symbolism and noted that Majidi drew a stark contrast between the beautiful simplicity of the countryside and the ugly disarray of urbanization.
“Iranians like to make symbolic movies, especially directors like Majidi,” Nojoumian said.
There are two more films left in the Persian Film Series, both by director Abbas Kiarostami. They will be screened March 24 in Taper Hall.
Students can revisit or catch up on the selected films of the Persian Film Series through USC Libraries.

Psychedelic indie rockers and past USC Springfest headliners Glass Animals have come out with their second single in recent months after a two-year hiatus — and it does not disappoint. “Your Love (Déjà Vu)” was released Wednesday on BBC Radio 1.
The song touches on an unhealthy relationship and the alluring nature of something that can hurt us, and yet, we still can’t get enough. In the song’s cascading pre-chorus, Bayley sings:
“Too far from over you / Beams from your M2 are blowin’ through my room / And now you lay down in my shoes / You dyed your hair blue / Oh, so much déjà vu”
Clearly, through the words, there is a struggle between being drawn to someone’s mystifying qualities while knowing that you’ve been around these parts before. You’ve done this, and deep down, you know how it ends. 
Glass Animals, with this fresh, personal track, deliver a new mood alongside their classic atmospheric musical production. Infamous for their ambiguous and whimsical lyricism, Glass Animals is not a band that often writes from personal experience. In fact, their last album in 2016, “How to Be a Human Being,” was a concept piece, a collection of 11 songs that were each inspired by the stories of different people that lead singer Dave Bayley met while traveling. Nevertheless, their dreamy lyrics have never had a problem with being catchy and have sparked many discussions in fan forums for years — though fans won’t have to do much theorizing about the meaning behind “Your Love (Déjà Vu).” 
In the on-air interview proceeding the drop with BBC Radio 1, Bayley spoke of the meaning behind the lyrics. 
“I think we’ve all found ourselves in fucked up relationships that make us feel sad and helpless,” Bayley said in the interview.  “A relationship that we know on some level is going to keep breaking our hearts. We let that person back into their lives over and over again, even though it always ends the same … maybe you find some strange comfort in the chaos.” 
The band does not hold back on producing the otherworldly musical soundscape that they are so famous for. A new effect, a new instrument even, can be discovered on a 100th repeat of a Glass Animals song. (If you’re really trying to challenge yourself, check out “Mama’s Gun” off HTBAHB — you’ll lose track of the myriad of sounds you can pick out when you really listen.) 
The track includes psychedelic guitar trills that serve as the cherry on top of the chorus sundae, a flute riff that adds a unique element to set this song apart from their other stuff and, of course, Bayley’s smooth and layered vocals, which no Glass Animals song is complete without. 
The song is carried by a consistent and punchy drum beat that works in harmony with Bayley’s singing to deliver on the high points of the lyrics. It also supports the characteristic sounds, most notably that playful up-down riff of the flute. The wind instrument’s presence is unconventional in the indie-rock genre, and it hasn’t really appeared often in their other music. In this song, the flute spot-lit and serves as the centerpiece of the single. 
“Your Love” paves the way for a new era of Glass Animals. With this new song, the band gives us something deep and a little closer to home for the first time. Bayley bears all in a series of verses and choruses that define a toxic, can’t-get-enough, love-hate relationship. 
It’s exciting, as he has time and time again shown that he is capable of touching on the darker aspects of the human experience, most notably in “Agnes” off HTBAHB and “Cocoa Hooves” off Zaba. So now that he is pointing that lens at himself, fans should prepare for an album that showcases vulnerability — for a band with a discography like Glass Animals, that will always be an artistically risky turn to take.
The vulnerability makes sense though, as their aforementioned hiatus was one that was forced upon them as a result of a near-fatal bicycle accident that their drummer got into before their North American tour last fall. In the interview, Joe  Seaward spoke about how it’s a miracle he gets to even make music and perform again as they weren’t sure he’d be able to do “much of anything” after the crash. And after two years of slow recovery, a process through which the band made sure to keep the fans updated, Joe sis gearing up to be back on the road for the Glass Animals “Déjà Vu” tour, a smaller, instantly sold out series of UK and North American shows. 
If you were lucky enough to score tickets, Glass Animals will be performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on March 11. If not, a near-future larger tour and perhaps even an album release is a bit unknown at the moment. Nevertheless, a new even-more psychedelic, even-more “vibey” era of Glass Animals has descended upon us, and it feels like déjà vu.

A judge issued final approval of the $215 million settlement in the case of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall in federal court Friday. 
The settlement was initially proposed in October 2018 but was delayed six months for modifications, including expanding the number of experts that will determine the payouts from one person to three and describing the tiered system for determining payouts in greater detail. Last month, a federal judge indicated he would give approval for the agreement.
The final version of the settlement will provide payouts ranging from $2,500 to $250,000 to Tyndall’s nearly 18,000 former patients. A panel jointly approved by the University and the class action lawyers comprising a gynecologist, a forensic psychologist and a retired federal judge will determine the amount of each payout for women who elect to make impact statements. 
The settlement also calls for the appointment of an external consultant and an independent women’s health advocate at the University. The consultant, sexual violence prevention expert Nancy Cantalupo, arrived at USC in the summer and has worked on the implementation of the Cultural Values Poll and the compilation of its results. 
Earlier this month, the class counsel proposed Virginia Commonwealth University professor Charol Shakeshaft as the women’s health advocate, who will work with USC Student Health, the Office of Professionalism and Ethics and the Office of Equity and Diversity to oversee the handling of sexual and racial misconduct complaints. 
Tyndall was arrested in June following a 2018 Los Angeles Times investigation into the sexual abuse of his patients over his nearly 30-year tenure as a doctor at Student Health. He faces 18 felony counts of sexual assault and 11 of sexual battery taking place between 2009 and 2016 and will stand trial in separate criminal proceedings conducted by the L.A. District Attorney’s Office.

The Undergraduate Student Government’s Executive Board proposed to restructure the organization during Tuesday’s Senate meeting. The last major change to the organization’s structure occurred in 2015 when the previous programming board was merged into USG as the programming branch. 
The proposal would change USG’s current composition of six branches — executive, legislative, advocacy, communications, funding and programming — to three. The three branches would include the executive, legislative and judicial branches.
The executive branch will house communications, funding and programming departments and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, according to the proposal. The legislative branch will house the Senate and legislative committees, and the judicial branch will house the Judicial Council and the Elections Commission. 
“We wanted to make sure that the legislative body and the executive branches had a balance of power, in terms of their advocacy work or functioning for USG,” USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin said. “In the past, we’ve seen a lot of overlap in terms of projects between the advocacy branch and the legislative branch. In general, we wanted to make our organization a bit more legislative-focused in terms of putting forward more resolutions and proposals because that’s a primary role of the Senate.” 
Constitutional changes regarding the reconstruction will be presented at next week’s meeting. 
Tahsin also presented her work with Sen. Haley Garland and senior adviser Maya McGrath on creating more spaces on campus conducive to studying and promoting a culture of well-being outside the classroom. 
“I think it’s pretty important that students have outlets, whether it’s for creative expression or whether it’s for just hanging out with your friends,” Tahsin said. “Having spaces that are designated for students to be, and to practice well-being, I think that’s pretty important.” 
According to Tahsin, the proposal will focus on adapting locations on campus to achieve the goal of improved well-being.
Tahsin, Garland and McGrath presented about their Tuesday morning meeting with Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni to discuss their newly finalized draft on utilizing these spaces for new opportunities.  
“He was super responsive,” Tahsin said. “What we’re proposing is pretty low-hanging fruit too, so to implement it won’t be a big overhaul or a big rethinking of how USC operates, so he was a big fan of it.” 
Sen. Omar Garcia presented his updates on creating a permanent clothing center on campus to rent professional attire to students. 
“It gives first-generation students, low-income students and other students the opportunity to wear professional clothing that’s rented from the Career Center to give them a great first impression going to career fairs or interviews,” Garcia said. 
The Marshall School of Business currently offers a program for Marshall students called Dress for Success that grants a select number of students free professional clothing. A temporary clothing closet was also previously provided through the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences that served 250 students before it closed. 
“We want something that’s more permanent so that students can keep going to it,” Garcia said. “We’ve been trying to figure out where we can hold the clothing closet, whether it’ll be here at USG or at the Career Center, but we just want a permanent solution. Right now, we have a J.C. Penney event that is going to be giving discounts for students that want suits, which is amazing, but it’s not a permanent solution.” 
Senior Director of Programming Montana Houston also presented new Service Student Assembly Co-Executive Director Isabella Oh and Assistant Director Samantha Sparacino, who will be confirmed at next week’s meeting. 
Sens. Hailey Robertson and Ben Rosenthal authored a climate resolution presented at last week’s meeting in response to the Divest SC Rally and the University’s announcement of its investment numbers in fossil fuels. The resolution formalized USG’s support of the University’s divestment from fossil fuels and was approved by the Senate.

Faculty, staff and students discussed accountability, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s competitive nature and the decreasing relevance of the Trojan Family at the Annenberg Culture Journey Town Hall Tuesday.
More than 50 people attended the town hall to learn about the Annenberg school experience. The town hall is the fourth of eight school town halls that USC has organized to discuss areas the community has identified to improve the University’s culture.
More than 800 individuals responded in the Annenberg values poll in Fall 2019 — a 31% participation rate among students, faculty and staff. According to these results, the top 10 values participants associated with Annenberg included reputation, communication, ambition, professionalism, hard work and collaboration. The results only showed one undesirable factor, known as a potentially limiting factor, which was competitiveness. 
The 800 participants were among the more than 19,000 members of the USC community who took the University-wide poll. Eighty-six percent of participants were either faculty or staff members and less than 20% included undergraduate and graduate students. 
The poll gauged individuals’ personal values, current culture and desired culture by identifying which 10 values they associated with each culture value category. Values were categorized based on whether or not they were potentially limiting factors. 
In Annenberg, there were overlaps between top values that faculty, staff and student cohorts indicated of the current University culture including diversity, ambition, Trojan Family, reputation and competitiveness. 
Although Trojan Family was included as a top value among all cohorts in current values, it was not used in the desired culture category. 
Those in attendance said the phrase was no longer relevant and that there was a need to redefine the abstract concept. 
Associate Dean of Operations James Vasquez also addressed the lack of student attendance at the ongoing culture session discussions and town halls, which was attended largely by faculty and staff. 
“All of our town halls and workshops are open to students, faculty and staff,” Vasquez said.  “What we are seeing is that students are not showing up. That’s part of the conversation we’re having about how we can encourage that to take place.” 
Some, like Annenberg adjunct lecturer Gary Wexler, said if the administration were concerned with the decreasing value of the concept of Trojan Family, they should bring alumni and students in these conversations.
“Are we a faculty-, administration-centered institution, or are we a student-centered institution?” Wexler said. “I think that’s the big question as far as students are concerned.”
Responses were analyzed using the Barrett Values Centre Model, which uses Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and categorizes organizational culture into seven levels: survival, relationship, self-esteem, transformation, internal cohesion, making a difference and service. An institution’s financial stability, for example, would fall under the survival level, and an institution’s competitive environment would fall under self-esteem. 
According to Senior Associate Dean for Administration Deb Lawler, the first three levels can have either a positive or negative connotation. Once an organization reaches the transformation level, it becomes accountable in addressing issues such as transparency and diversity. 
“When there’s an obsessive focus on a particular level, you start to see things that become potentially limiting,” Lawler said. “If you have an excessive focus at level one, that’s where you’re going to see things like job insecurity, greed … [or] level three: bureaucracy, complacency and competitiveness.”
The poll results were also used to categorize the entropy levels, a metric that represents the dysfunction of an organization, culture facilitator JaBari Brown said. Entropy levels ranged from 10-50%. An organization ranging under 10% would be considered healthy functioning and anything greater than 50% means the institution is undergoing a cultural crisis. 
According to poll results, the University holds a 28% entropy level with Annenberg at 21%. Between 11-20% entropy level involves minor issues, although not stated in the poll results, that require careful monitoring. The results were organized into three groups: an individual’s role as either a staff, faculty or student, race/ethnicity and gender identity. The specific issues that these groups faced were not listed but that each group, including Latinx people, Black people and the LGBTQ community faced “varying degrees of challenges” at USC. 
Lawler said that when audience members were asked to select which value the University should focus on during culture value poll discussions, the majority chose accountability — however, accountability to whom was not explicitly stated. 
During the Q&A session, Wexler said he was unsure as to who the accountability question is aimed at, whether it is for administration, faculty or students. He also said that as a professor, he does not understand his accountability role besides turning in required syllabi to administration each semester but has otherwise not had administrators regulate his lecture content. 
“Nobody’s ever … sat in my classroom to [assess] what I [lecture on],” he said. “The only time I ever hear from anybody is … when there was a problem in a student evaluation … I feel like I’m running my own entrepreneurial class.”
Vasquez said the culture values initiative is still in phase two of the alignment phases — aligning values pinpointed by faculty, staff and students to be applied to University-wide processes — where they are representing results to the University community and administration through town halls and discussion sessions. 
“This is not going to be a one-year or two-year engagement,” Vasquez said. “It’s a multiple-year engagement that’s really important because this is the start of conversations for us to figure out as a community where we want to go.”

Truman Fritz and Rose Ritch will serve as Undergraduate Student Government’s 2020-21 president and vice president after defeating three other tickets in the race, Director of Elections and Recruitment Vaanyasri Goel announced Tuesday. 
Along with election results, Goel also discussed unofficial voter turnout numbers and the winners of the senatorial election at the USG meeting. 
The Truman & Rose ticket received 1,522 votes — 32% of total voter turnout — while the Sara & Rohit ticket received 1,427 votes, the Christopher & Trinity ticket received 847 votes, and the Christine & Miles ticket received 812 votes. More than 4,700 votes were cast this year, with 142 students abstaining. 
The 2019 election saw a similar turnout of more than 4,000 voters, though only three presidential tickets were open compared to four. The amount of abstaining students almost halved since last year.
According to Fritz, the election process requires a significant time commitment — with candidates orchestrating their campaign in December — and constant engagement with the campaign. The time-consuming process took away from the personal lives of the candidates and their campaign teams, Fritz said.
“One of the things that we implemented this year that I advocated for was the voluntary well-being pact, which I think actually did help … being able to have a work-life balance,” Fritz said.
Fritz, a junior majoring in business administration, currently serves as the USG senior director of communications. Ritch, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and sociology, is currently a senator. Fritz and Ritch emphasized student well-being, inclusion, administrative accountability and sustainability in their presidential campaign. They cited the lack of student representation in administrative circles as a cause of some of the problems on campus in recent years.
“Administrators do not have a student-first mindset,” Fritz said. “And we want to not only establish advisory councils … to bring students at large directly into the conversations and have them advise on [University policy making] decisions, but also, we want to be able to establish a better connection between USG [and the] student body.”
Candidates Christopher McMorran and Trinity Lee included a similar emphasis on accountability in their platform. According to McMorran, USG requires final approval from the Board of Trustees to enact its legislative resolutions but believes the lack of student representation within the governing body hinders important progress. 
“I think my big thing is getting a student on the Board of Trustees because that’s really the key to unlocking everything else we can achieve in USG,” McMorran said.
The 2019 election cycle became contentious in its final weeks and generated political tension between candidates, Fritz said. According to a previous Daily Trojan article, last year’s presidential candidates Meagan Lane and Michaela Murphy believed the write-in campaigns — including winning candidates Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin — violated Elections Code because their names were provided on the ballot despite being write-in candidates.
“Last year was really political,” Fritz said. “And we didn’t want to see that same process play out in this election cycle or in future election cycles.” 
Fritz said the USG executive team focused on unity throughout the organization this year, which improved the relationships between candidates for this election cycle, a departure from the tensions from last year.
McMorran advised the incoming president and vice president to increase USG involvement with student groups on campus. 
“I would really encourage [Fritz and Ritch] to get down on the ground [and] be at student events, go to student organizations and be really visible,” McMorran said. 
Ritch said this presidential election process became one of her most demanding yet important experiences in her time at USC, which required countless late nights and meetings with nearly 70 student organizations within four weeks. Fritz and Ritch commended their campaign team for its invaluable contributions to their presidential campaign through social media promotion and on-the-ground campaigning on Trousdale.
“We had a phenomenal team — we could not have been more grateful [for them],” Ritch said. “It took a village sort of effort for this, absolutely.”
The USG 2020-21 Senate will comprise Isabel Washington, Dario Arganese, Trinity Moore, Alexis Areias, Mayra Rodriguez, Max Gomez, Lennon Wesley III, Ruben Romeo, Kevin Gutierrez, Cathy Ding, Gabriel Savage and Julian Lin. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article miswrote Alexis Areias’ name. It has since been updated with the correct spelling. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The USC men’s tennis team traveled to Madison, Wis., this past weekend and triumphed over some of the toughest competition in the country to take home the ITA National Team Indoor title. Over 1,300 miles away, the then-No. 19 USC women’s team fell to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at the USTA College MatchDay event in Orlando, Fla. 
Last week the men’s team experienced its fair share of ups and downs. After ranking No. 1 in the nation, the Trojans lost to the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes. USC bounced back during its next match against Wisconsin and presumably hoped to carry the momentum from that win into the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament, an event the Trojans hadn’t won since 2012.
USC took its top players to the competition: then-No. 1 junior Daniel Cukierman, No. 15 sophomore Mor Bulis, No. 24 senior Brandon Holt, No. 33 senior Riley Smith, No. 65 freshman Stefan Dostanic, No. 69 freshman Ryder Jackson and sophomore Bradley Frye all traveled to Madison. 
In the Round of 16 Friday, USC had a minor scare during a match against then-No. 11 TCU. The Trojans dug themselves into a 2-1 deficit early, with their lone point coming from Dostanic. Fortunately for USC, Smith, Bulis and Cukierman all fought back, winning the match 4-2.  
In the quarterfinals, the Trojans faced a familiar foe in the No. 8 Stanford Cardinal, who the Trojans easily handled 6-1 earlier this season. USC repeated the performance Saturday, winning 4-0. 
Later, during an intense semifinal against then-No. 13 Michigan, USC fell into a 3-1 hole with its only point coming from Smith. Once again, the Trojans did not back down, as Dostanic, Jackson and Cukierman won their matches to deliver the Trojans a 4-3 victory. 
“We are not quitters,” head coach Brett Masi said after the match. “It just shows the amount of heart and desire that these guys have, and [our] never — say — done mentality.” 
After defeating Michigan, USC faced then-No. 5 North Carolina in the tournament’s finals. The Tar Heels were coming off an impressive victory against Ohio State, sweeping the Buckeyes 4-0.
In doubles play against UNC, it came down to the wire as the two teams were tied 1-1. The No. 58 partnership of Cukierman and Smith was able to seal the deal against UNC senior William Blumberg and sophomore Brian Cernoch in a tiebreaker 7-6 (5).
In singles, the Trojans started off slow as Holt retired in his match against Blumberg because of illness, which tied up the score 1-1. This didn’t faze the Trojans. Cukierman, Dostanic and Bulis all proceeded to win in straight sets against their opponents, winning the final 4-1.
“Inspirational, one-of-a-kind, never seen anything like it,” Masi said. “We were very sick, we have injuries, we have everything, [but] every guy on the team stepped up and did their part, and if it wasn’t for that courageous effort, we don’t get it done [today].”
Masi said he thinks the win will provide a confidence boost for the squad.
“Winning the national indoors definitely is something that’s a goal, and they are going to look at it and [say], ‘This is a super special moment,’” Masi said. “The way we won it and how we did it, that just builds us and gives us more and more confidence.”
While the men’s team competed in Madison, the women’s team faced off against Notre Dame as part of the USTA’s College MatchDay event. USC freshmen Eryn Cayetano and Payton Saca; sophomores Estella Jaeger and No. 119 Danielle Willson; and seniors No. 108 Sydney Van Alphen and No. 15 Angela Kulikov represented USC at the event. In a hard-fought match, USC fell 4-3 to the Irish. The Trojans went up early, winning the doubles point thanks to the partnerships of Jaeger and Willson and Cayetano and Kulikov. However, in singles play, the Irish came back, quickly winning two points in a row as Saca and Willson both fell. Still, the Trojans were relentless, as Cayetano beat junior Cameron Corse in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, and Kulikov won in similar fashion against senior Zoe Spence, 6-4, 6-2. 
Up 3-2, the Trojans only needed one more win to take the matchup; however, the team failed to cement the victory. Van Alphen lost to No. 122 junior Ally Bojczuk, 6-4, 3-6, 1-6, and Jaeger lost in a tight match against redshirt sophomore Julia Lilien, losing a tiebreaker in the final set, 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (3).
The men’s team will now look ahead to weekend matches against Army and Air Force at Marks Stadium while the women’s team will prepare to face San Diego State and UCSD Friday and Saturday on the road.

From popular sports like track and field to lesser-known games such as handball, many of the sports at the Olympics have a long history and tradition of memorable moments, athletes and events.
The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo is expected to continue this tradition with the addition of a number of new sports. Baseball, softball, karate, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing will all enter the mix this July.
Baseball in particular holds a special place in my heart. I have been a fan for as long as I can remember. Since fifth grade I’ve been a Seattle Mariners fan, and I still remember coming home from school every spring afternoon and watching baseball games for hours on end.
Baseball is not entirely new to the Olympics. Actually, from 1992-2008, baseball was played at each Summer Olympics until the International Olympic Committee decided to remove it from the games — a controversial decision because of baseball’s worldwide appeal.
One of the biggest reasons for removing baseball was due to the fact that MLB players were not allowed to participate in the games. Removing MLB players from the equation also meant removing the best players in the world. With its reintroduction to the Games in 2020, many fans are elated to see one of the Olympics’ most storied sports return. 
However, other decisions made by the IOC have been made without paying much attention to the history of the games. New sports like sport climbing and surfing have been added with the hope that they will allow younger athletes to compete. As beneficial as this may be for the next generation of athletes, the Committee’s additions reveal an inconsistent record of upholding the history of the Olympics.
In 1896, the inaugural Olympics hosted a grand total of nine sports, all of which are still played at the Games today. Now, 124 years later, that number has grown to 33. Many of these new sports, skateboarding and surfing included, distract from traditional sports. Even though they’re exciting and fun to watch, that doesn’t necessarily mean they should be hosted at what might be the world’s most significant international sports event. 
The intent of the IOC to favor what’s popular over what’s tradition has played out in other sports as well. In February 2013, the committee decided to remove wrestling from the 2020 Games, causing an uproar among many fans. After widespread outrage, only months passed before the IOC reinstated the sport.
According to IOC spokesperson Mark Adams, the decision to remove wrestling was not because anything was wrong with wrestling but was because it detracted from the attention given to the Game’s other sports. 
I understand that the IOC believes it is working within its best interests when making decisions like this, but for fans of Olympic tradition like myself, it hurts to see the seeming lack of recognition the IOC has demonstrated toward this tradition.
It is clear that the IOC is adding and doing away with sports purely to adjust to the changing sports interests of newer generations. That’s not bad in and of itself, but it shouldn’t be the sole motivating factor behind the IOC’s decisions. It is a welcome development that the Olympics is trying to attract and adapt to a greater age demographic, but progress isn’t always made by abandoning tradition. The IOC is focusing more on adopting to new preferences rather than upholding the traditions of the Games.

USC women’s basketball associate head coach Aarika Hughes knew recruiting Endyia Rogers was going to be difficult from the get-go.
Hughes, who has been in contact with Rogers and her family since essentially the beginning of her recruitment, noted the freshman guard can be tough to read given her occasional reluctance to express herself.
“The relationship with Endyia was one I had to work hard on and work with,” Hughes said. “She’s not a kid that opens up really easily.”
Coming from an athletically gifted and basketball-driven family, Rogers has been refining her skills from the earliest days of her childhood. Dating back to years of backyard basketball games with her brother and grueling summer training sessions with her father, Jerome, the court has always been Rogers’ playground.
Given her father’s dedication to helping her improve as an athlete, Rogers is no stranger to hard work.
Both Rogers and Andy Zihlman, who was Rogers’ head coach at Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas, Texas, cited specific memories of Rogers’ father, who played college basketball at North Texas, and the demanding summer workouts he put Rogers and her brother through.
The dreaded Rogers summer workout routine included pushing tractor tires and running full-court sprints for conditioning along with skill workouts for technical refinement.
“I really never wanted to work out with [Jerome] because the workouts were hard, tiring,” Rogers said. “Four laps around the track. Ten sprints across the field … agility work. Then go into the weight room and have us jump over a bench 100 times. Then go up to the gym and do our workout.”
“She was putting in almost a four-hour workout sometimes,” Zihlman said. “Not every day, but a lot of those during the [summer] season.” 
The 2018-19 Gatorade Texas Girls Basketball Player of the Year, the tournament MVP of her state champion team and a member of the state all-academic team, Rogers is one of the most accomplished players to come out of the state of Texas in recent years — both on and off the basketball court. Her confidence has risen as her widespread recognition has increased, but much of Rogers’ self-assurance comes from the trust she has in her abilities, a trait that has stuck with her from a young age.
Zihlman recalled one of his first interactions with Rogers when she was in eighth grade on a visit to Bishop Lynch High School and wanted to go one-on-one with a member of the junior varsity team at the time. 
Zihlman allowed the match to commence, and to the surprise of everyone except Endyia, she won. From that moment on, Zihlman knew he had a special player on his hands. 
Rogers’ athletic success was well-documented throughout her career at Bishop Lynch, but many aren’t aware of the level of academic excellence demanded by Rogers’ parents and maintained by Rogers herself throughout her high school career. She maintained a 4.0 grade point average in four years at a well-respected private prep school,  and her academic achievements didn’t come without hardship. 
Zihlman remembered a specific anecdote from before a game in Rogers’ underclassman years in which her pre-calculus teacher showed up prior to the game to speak to Rogers regarding her performance in class. 
Upon hearing the news of Rogers’ difficulties in class, her mother Brandy confiscated her phone immediately, demanding Rogers improve her grade if she wanted said phone back. Judging from her final grades, Rogers took it to heart.
“She’s really smart, she works, she studies,” Zihlman said. “We’d be on the bus and she’s studying by herself or with other kids.” 
This kind of “no-nonsense” attitude instilled into Rogers by her parents has transitioned well into her collegiate life, as Zihlman noted he’s heard encouraging things regarding Rogers’ academic and athletic performance so far at USC from head coach Mark Trakh. 
“She’s definitely the best player we’ve ever had,” Zihlman said. “We love what she does.”
A player of immense athletic skill and exceptional maturity, Rogers was always going to be one of USC’s most sought after recruits for Trakh’s most recent recruiting class. 
“I got to the point where [she] and I were talking daily,” Hughes said of recruiting Rogers. “When you get a kid like that, that comes from the family that she does, it truly connects.” 
Hughes noted one of the most difficult parts of recruiting Rogers to USC was getting her family’s approval and assuring them their “princess” would be taken care of in her transition from Texas to Southern California.
“Endyia perceives herself as royalty,” Hughes said jokingly when asked about a tweet she posted referring to Rogers as #PrincessinLA. “I gave her the nickname Princess Endyia throughout the recruiting process, and it’s kind of stuck. She expects me to call her that and I joke around with her.” 
When Rogers announced her final five schools in July prior to her senior year of high school, there was no immediate trend among her preferred schools.
In fact, Rogers’ final five schools included Ohio State, Texas, Tennessee and Mississippi State. Hughes knew selling Rogers and her family on USC would require more than just a pitch about athletics.
“I think, honestly, for her, this was the full package,” Hughes said. “You’re not sacrificing academics. You’re not sacrificing city. You’re not sacrificing conference because we have the best conference in the country. And then the ability to come in as a freshman knowing there was availability, not anything promised, but an availability for her to play. And clearly she’s come out there and she’s earned her spot.” 
When weighing USC over other prestigious programs she received offers from, Rogers stressed the importance of what USC brings off the court as well as on it. 
“I wanted something different,” she said. “I didn’t want to stay home. I thought that I could make an impact on the program here as a freshman. I had a great relationship with the coaches.” 
Upon first interaction, Rogers appears more introverted than her nickname would suggest. She has spent much of her first year at USC adjusting to life on her own, away from her family and friends in Texas.  
USC’s staff is hoping it can get Rogers more comfortable with media attention as she continues to settle into student-athlete life at USC. 
For Rogers, the most difficult part of her transition aside from being away from her family was the responsibility that comes with independence. 
“You have to figure stuff out on your own,” Rogers said. “I was struggling for a bit after I realized that I still need to work out and stop being lazy.” 
Her teammates have noticed her growth, speaking highly of Rogers’ contributions despite having such a short adjustment period. 
“She’s just a competitor and she’s gonna put the ball in the hoop,” freshman teammate Alissa Pili said of Rogers. “She could play with all these top players in the country … She just makes it look effortless sometimes.”
What Rogers misses most about home is “the food” she said half-jokingly.
Now that she’s had time to properly settle into life as a Trojan and get over the initial homesickness of leaving her native Dallas and most of her family, Rogers has begun to shine like many knew she would. 
Ranked in the top 40 of her recruiting class and earning the label of “five-star” recruit, Rogers didn’t surprise anyone when she scored 18 points and grabbed seven rebounds in her college debut Nov. 5, as she’s proven she’s no stranger to the big stage. 
In high school, Rogers scored 39 points in a state semifinal, only to top the aforementioned performance with a 40-point outing in the championship game.
Rogers made her presence known in a three-game stretch in late January in which she averaged 26.7 points per game against a conference gauntlet featuring home games against Washington and Washington State along with a trip to Tempe, Ariz. to face Arizona State.
Along with her scoring contributions, Rogers racked up a career-high nine assists in the overtime win against Washington. In the same game, Rogers scored 24 of her career-high 29 points in the final 25 minutes of the contest, taking control of the game with her scoring and passing vision.
Rogers’ breakout week earned USC two wins — which would have been three if not for a triple-overtime loss on the road against Arizona State — and ultimately led to her being named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, the first individual honor of Rogers’ short collegiate career. 
“I was proud when I finally started stepping up a bit when we played the Washington [teams] that weekend. I felt my team rallied in behind me,” Rogers said. “That Freshman of the Week was a big accomplishment.” 
As she continues to progress and grow within her role on Trakh’s young team, Rogers and those around her have high expectations for her development as a student and player. 
As for her long term USC goals, Rogers aspirations go beyond qualifying for and making a deep run in the NCAA Tournament or even winning a national championship. 
“First of all, I hope to get a degree,” said Rogers, who majors microbiology and hoping to pursue a career in plastic surgery. “I hope to come out a great young woman and just learn a lot about life.” 
Likewise, her coaches, both past and present, agree that she has an incredible opportunity at hand as a student-athlete at USC.
“When she goes back to [Bishop Lynch] school, she’s like a superstar,” Zihlman said. “I’m excited to see what she’s going to do the next three and a half years at USC.” 
Fortunately for the Trojans, it appears they’ve found the perfect player to lead them for those three and a half years. 
“I want the best for her academically, her experience here at USC and of course athletically out on the floor,” Hughes said. “I couldn’t have asked for a better kid to come here and help with a rising program. She’s been awesome.”
