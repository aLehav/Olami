After a year, Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren’s terms as Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president are coming to an end. 
During their campaign, the duo ran on a platform based on rebuilding trust between USG and the general student body and tackling financial barriers and accessibility issues. Some of the progress Areias and Warren made, in collaboration with the senate, included projects around accessibility, survivor support, free menstrual products and Department of Public Safety budget transparency, picking up pace from their previous work as USG senator and chief diversity officer respectively.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Areias highlighted the difficult transition of starting her former position as senator while dealing with the logistical setbacks of the impeachment of former USG president Truman Fritz and the resignation of former vice president Rose Ritch in 2020. It’s that time of uncertainty and precarity that motivated the team to run for the presidential platform, where they carried over their most cherished senate project into their presidency: free menstruation products.
“[The free menstrual products] started as a pilot program when I was in the senate, and now that we are president and vice president, it’s something that we’ve been able to see through to fruition,” Areias said. “So, starting this next year, pretty much every single building, every single bathroom will have free menstrual products for use.”
Though the free menstrual products and the creation of the Student Health Advisory Committee, which represents the student body for USC Student Health, were accomplishments for Areias, she points out the term was marked by the seven reported instances of sexual assault and drugging — six at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house and one at an undisclosed location.
It’s this event that also defined Warren’s time in office.
Warren, in an interview with the Daily Trojan, said she remembers joining the protest held by the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence, where the group collectively marched down to the row in protest of the University’s failure to prevent sexual violence against women and provide support for survivors on campus following multiple days of protests after the sexual assault reports.
“Being part of what was going on those weeks, and trying to quickly come up with solutions with the coalition, and to advocate for students during that time, that was a whirlwind,” Warren said. “It was incredibly, incredibly rewarding to be doing that kind of work in such a heightened time when it felt like we were actually at a tipping point where we could make significant progress.”
In the days following the assaults, Warren, working with chief of staff Max Gomez, presented an initial list of demands for USC, which included removing the members and Interfraternity Council chapters involved in incidents of sexual assault and drugging, implementing reforms and University oversight for Greek life spaces, provided drug testing strips to students and overhauled the systems available for students to report sexual assaults and crimes. The next day, USG released a student-wide statement of support for survivors via a communitywide email Oct. 27.
Warren said that one of her goals from the start was to make Title IX more accessible to the student body and streamline support for survivors. USG  expanded bystander intervention training programs across campus through its funding department and made progress in creating a centralized reporting system.
Another prominent part of their term was accessibility, Warren said.
“I hadn’t heard disability being talked about in USG,” Warren said. “To make the campus more accessible was my personal motivation. I think in the last year, we’ve done more in accessibility than has been done in USG in the past.”
Under the Areias-Warren administration, USG  created accessibility funds, which will help with accessibility training and increase program accessibility for students from registered student organizations, and created an ADA Non-Compliance Reporting Form for students. 
Additionally, Warren said USG pushed for online hybrid learning at “every admin meeting” that they attended over the summer and led an “Absence Notification Project” to alleviate the pressure on students as they adjusted to in-person classes amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
“​​We have a long way to go in making campus more accessible, but we’re just getting started, and I feel like we’ve laid good groundwork for future years to come in and make accessibility a priority,” Warren said.
Areias worked to spearhead this accessibility through other initiatives, including by leading a search for workstudy alternatives for undocumented students who often don’t have access to workstudy due to the absence of federal funding. She also collaborated on the project with external committee chair Sydney Brown and IDEAS — Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success — a cultural assembly focused on providing resources for undocumented students. This collaboration echoed Areias and Warren’s campaign goals: to prioritize inclusivity.
“There is a lot of work that’s going on on this campus and advocacy that doesn’t just happen within USG,” Areias said. “[We’ve been] making that extra effort to include groups that haven’t been historically represented within our Undergraduate Student Government, and ensuring that, instead of siloing that work, that we’re really bringing in that advocacy and working to help promote that.”
This cultural representation was reflected in the confirmation of nine new advocacy liaisons in September. The members are part of the new advocacy initiative within the organization, which heads different projects from their respective cultural assemblies with USG.
“There are so many things that we didn’t get done, and I think that’s what is hard when you’re in this position is because you just want to work on everything and do everything. There are still so many things in so many areas that we leave untouched. I think it’s exciting for whoever comes in next because you hope that they do even more than you ever could.”
Another collaborative initiative that Warren and Brown worked on in collaboration with USG was DPS Budget Transparency, where they managed several projects pertaining to the issue. Warren said they worked in favor of “counselors, not cops,” and unveiled a collaboration with the Black Student Assembly to support Kayla Love, a graduate student studying chemistry, who was involved in a dispute with the Los Angeles Police Department and USC Los Angeles County Medical Center.
“I think we’re going to see a lot of progress when it comes to the DPS budget being transparent,” Warren said. “I’ve been able to sit on the selection committee for the new DPS chief, and I think we’re going to see very exciting changes once we get a new chief later this year.”
Warren said her time as vice president has taught her how to prioritize and have balance in everything she does. 
“There are so many things that we didn’t get done, and I think that’s what is hard when you’re in this position is because you just want to work on everything and do everything,” Warren said. “There are still so many things in so many areas that we leave untouched. I think it’s exciting for whoever comes in next because you hope that they do even more than you ever could.”
Areias also touched on the bureaucratic struggles of not having every project easily flow through the organization.
“There are certain things … that you come into this office expecting to be straightforward,” Areias said. “‘Why would there be any opposition to this? This is a great thing. This is something that will serve the student body,’ and you quickly realize that that’s not always the case.”
Areias used that time to learn how to prioritize projects and also how to aggressively advocate to the right people.
Referring to their term as “bittersweet,” Warren said she hopes the next generation of USG will prioritize inclusivity and make the most of their time in office.
“I was so thrilled to have that opportunity to be part of a larger voice when it comes to advocating with administrators for improvements around campus,” Warren said. “I hope that people feel that energy going forward and that it’s something that’s long-lasting when it comes to just knowing how much there is to really tackle here.”

When George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were killed by police in the summer of 2020, Ezi Ogbuli, the community chair of the Black Student Assembly at the time, teamed up with her intern, Tyler Trouillot, to launch an initiative receiving feedback from Black students about the Department of Public Safety’s treatment.
The anecdotes were disturbing accounts of harsh encounters with the campus’s police.
“Even though [students are] dressed in full USC gear and are on campus, they get stopped and asked like, ‘What are you doing here?’ or ‘Show us your I.D.,” Ogbuli said.
That experience led Ogbuli, a senior majoring in global studies, to add advocacy to her responsibilities of creating unity for Black students. It was this that created the foundation for her role as advocacy liaison for BSA and Undergraduate Student Government.
Advocacy liaisons essentially serve as the “middle person” between cultural assemblies, which are organizations that serve the interests of different identities at USC and USG. They serve as representatives for assemblies such as the Black Student Assembly, the Latinx Student Assembly and the Queer Student and Ally Assembly.
Kavita Rai, USG’s current chief diversity officer, created the positions of advocacy liaisons last Fall, to create engaging and inclusive discussions between USG and the student body.
“The goal was to really ensure that everything felt much more interconnected, and DEI wasn’t a separate committee, but it was integrated into everything we did within the legislative department,” Rai said.
Kevyn Calleja, a sophomore majoring in business administration and accounting, is another one of those representatives. He works as a mediator between USG and IDEAS — Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success — to bring forth change for undocumented students on campus.
Calleja first started as a director of membership for IDEAS in Spring 2021. Once appointed as advocacy liaison in the Fall, he saw how USG helped bolster IDEAS’ membership solely by marketing general body meetings through social media and at legislative branch meetings.
Calleja said that he saw 15 new faces at one of his meetings after USG helped promote their events, including their general body meeting where they wrote letters to migrants in detention centers.
The student government also helped connect advocacy liaisons to USC faculty and administration, Ogblui said.
“It increases the chance of getting an email reply and getting someone to actually sit down and meet with you, or to have a conversation with you because they understand the greater stakes,” Ogbuli said. 
It’s this easily facilitated connection to faculty members that Calleja also appreciates. USG can create legitimacy for cultural assemblies’ projects, convincing faculty members to step in and contribute through their “official” reputation.
“Sometimes, assemblies don’t have the connection to faculty,” Calleja said. “They have this connection to students through general body meetings and stuff, but if they want to perform a project to carry that out, sometimes it’s hard to find the faculty.” 
For Calleja, USG’s ties to faculty and administration have made it easier to push forward cultural projects, such as a DEI training run in collaboration with Scholarships A-Z, an undocumented youth intiative based in Tuscon, Ariz.
“I work with that advocacy liaison to organize the UndocuAlly Training,” said Rai about her partnership with Calleja. “Having the input of IDEAS directly involved in a project that USG is working on and involves that specific community has been really helpful, and it’s been something that, obviously, brings really important perspectives.”
“It’s just a great team effort to provide better perspectives, a better community within USG. And then, of course, that transfers on to the greater student body.”
By introducing these often unheard perspectives, Calleja said that he believes USG can serve the greater student population.
“It’s just a great team effort to provide better perspectives, a better community within USG. And then, of course, that transfers on to the greater student body,” Calleja added.
Ogbuli prioritizes the effort to insert the perspectives of marginalized communities through her various collaborative projects that touch on issues concerning Black students and students of color.
“How I’ve kind of approached the role then is to be more involved in what USG is doing,” Ogbuli said. “Instead of telling them what BSA’s doing and then they offer support, I’m going to committee meetings … raising awareness about different issues that are going on on campus.”
Through this partnership, Ogbuli has worked with the External Affairs committee chair, Sydney Brown, to work on issues such as DPS’s budget transparency and the hiring process for the new DPS chief. 
In those steps towards advocating for Black students, Ogbuli has confronted some frustrations along the way, including navigating a middle ground between the interests of BSA and USG’s lengthy bureaucratic process. As an advocacy liaison, she’s wanted to push more radical changes to DPS and their policing strategies but feels often stunted by USG’s extensive protocols and regulations that prolong projects and make reforms, but not large structural change.
“I’m there to offer support to things I feel like are going to be helpful or we’re going to actually, you know, push the needle forward,” Ogbuli said. “I can’t say that’s all the projects. But you know that again, there’s red tape, so you can only do it as much as you can.”
It’s this balance that Calleja has also had to figure out after transitioning into the role. He recalls how IDEAS has pushed for the Undocumented Trojan Resource Center, a hub for undocumented students, since 2018. 
“When I started working with USG, [they said], ‘OK, you gotta take a step back and see what you’ve already been given,’” Calleja said. “For the UTRC, I had to take a step back on trying to push that forward and first [focus on] establishing smaller projects. And once we have those projects established, once we maximize the resources, we can really push for bigger.”
Liaisons tackle the balancing act of pushing their projects but also using the advantage of their collaborative relationship with USG, such as having a team backing them up to propel their projects forward so they aren’t the sole people advocating for their communities.
“Being able to have some more manpower, have some more resources is definitely helpful, and it takes the weight off your shoulder,” Ogbuli said.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed funding opportunities, a new program to provide free menstrual products and introduced new members in the senate meeting Tuesday. 
At the start of the meeting, chief financial officer Adenike Makinde announced that 65% of USG’s funding has been used, encouraged members to make proposals to use the remainder of the funding and detailed the funding proposals process, with separate processes for proposed funding under $500 and those over.
Three funds proposed throughout the semester have recently opened, including the accessibility fund, social innovation fund and green engagement fund. 
The accessibility fund will provide funding for programs contributing toward physical or institutional access for communities that are facing disadvantages. The goal of the social innovation fund is to provide students the opportunity to pursue a short-term project centered around student needs and the needs of the surrounding community. Finally, the green engagement fund will provide financial support to build community and culture through sustainability and environmental justice.   
President Alexis Areias introduced the new chief communications officer, Jacob Wheeler, a freshman majoring in journalism and political science, as well as the onboarding of new wellness chair Bradley Furgerson, a junior majoring in neuroscience and Chinese. 
Areias provided a progress update on her project, a partnership with Leda Health, which aims to provide at-home test kits for sexual assault survivors. As of now, Leda Health is partnering with members of the Panhellenic Council and is in discussion with the Interfraternity Council.
She also discussed her successful free menstrual products pilot program, providing free menstrual products in every building across campus, and is working to provide work-study alternatives for undocumented students and reinstating free blue books and scantrons for students. 
“I have seen that USG is really trying to do something that we can put money towards to help our community,” Areias said.
Senator Nivea Krishnan provided updates on three main projects that she has been working on, including a meal swipe donation program for students who are facing food insecurity on campus, a petition recognition resolution that she is working on with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation to ensure administration will listen to their demands and an outreach program to address concerns about the vaccine in the community. 
In his presentation, senator Brian Stowe provided updates on his progress with establishing the Military Associated Student Association, sharing that he has authored a statement with senator Russell Augustin in support of its incorporation. A constitution has been sent, and signatures from the community were gathered. MASA is now in the progress of drafting a resolution that is slated to be presented to the senate next month.
During the new business section of the meeting, senator Arie Abija presented a funding proposal for the art therapy initiative to be held in late March in collaboration with the Survivor Support Community, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Visions and Voices and Delta Omicron Zeta. 
The mission of the project is to create a community for healing survivors by having safe and supportive allies. The project will start with a guided meditation, then proceed with anonymous sharing of experiences and thoughts, a group painting session and conclude with a debrief discussion. 
“After what happened at Sigma Nu last semester, I just couldn’t not do it … I found being a survivor to be incredibly isolating,” SSC president Sammie Sorsby-Jones said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It felt less of a choice and more of a calling. I just really felt like I had to do this. I needed to create this space at USC because I just saw all these survivors trying to support each other.”
The proposal requested $3,000 in funding to spend on a canvas stand and tarp, set-up, refreshments and invite artist Claudia Concha. The funding proposal will be up for debate at next week’s meeting.

Strolling through the countless art galleries of Los Angeles, it’s easy to be struck by stunning new perspectives of the world at large yet find yourself even more astonished by the unexplored layers of L.A. you never even knew you were missing. 
If you’re looking to experience the art of L.A. without paying museum admission prices, a day of gallery-hopping is a great excuse to bust out of the Fryft zone and waste a Saturday. With new shows by modern legends and rising stars from USC and across the nation, here are a few of the month’s most promising openings to catch before they’re gone.
Alfonso Gonzalez Jr.: “There Was There” – Matthew Brown Los Angeles (Feb. 12 – Mar. 19)
In “There Was There’s” 30 odd pieces, Alfonso Gonzalez Jr. visualizes the cultural exchange between residents of the South Central community and the physical environment in which they live and work. A native Angeleno, Gonzalez’s work fills Matthew Brown Los Angeles’s Mid-City location but appears recognizable to the area outside the gallery’s front doors. 
Multimedia pieces range from sculptures poking fun at coin-operated rides often found outside of a local grocery store to oversized paintings that become the walls of the gallery itself, fit with vibrant signage for beauty salons. In his satiric yet profound first solo show, Gonzalez comments on the nature of late-stage capitalism’s advertisement-congested world as it appears on the ground through the eyes of the people living within it.
Zoe Alameda: “rest my head on a pile of tacks” – Gayle and Ed Roski Gallery (Feb. 25 – Mar. 9)
In this debut solo exhibition at the Gayle and Ed Roski Gallery on USC’s campus, Zoe Alameda, a junior majoring in fine arts, contemplates the distorted perspective of a generational cohort growing up looking at the world for the very first time through the lens of an iPhone. Through paintings, installations and sculpture work, Alameda superimposes internet artifacts, such as anime characters and Instagram screenshots, over jagged landscapes of a world stumbling towards dystopia. As terrifying as it is awe-inspiring, “rest my head on a pile of tacks” juxtaposes the looming digital existence that threatens to swallow our species whole with the reality of the declining earth we are doomed to leave behind.
Dominique Fung: “Coastal Navigation” – Nicodim Gallery (Feb. 12 – Mar. 19)
Through 10 paintings, Dominique Fung’s “Coastal Navigation” at Nicodim Gallery forms a path from sea to land and back again. The Brooklyn-based painter casts objects, such as terracotta bulls and jade pagodas, underwater — out of space and time from their habitual environments on land. 
Just as rising waters from climate change are politically regarded as a work of fantasy, the seawater of Fung’s golden, celadon and lapis ocean floor reflects and rearranges these traces of man until they are personified to dream-like proportions. In “Traverse Through,” Gatsby-like eyes embellish a fringed lampshade come to life, casting an all-knowing light upon the shadowy ocean floor. Fung’s surreal “Coastal Navigation” presents a journey that is at once, both timeless and deathly immediate, magical and melancholic, and one not to be missed.
Arantza Peña Popo: “The World is Looking for You” – Junior High L.A. (Feb. 11- Mar. 6)
“The World is Looking for You” sees Arantza Peña Popo, a junior majoring in journalism, interweaving three disparate narratives threaded together by the joint exploration of what it is to exist within the dark of night. In adapting the “zine” style to a gallery exhibition, the viewer is brought in close to interact intimately with Peña Popo’s characters and their stories. While the works themselves are physically small, the narrative they express explodes far beyond their traditional rectangular confines, capturing the swells of emotion released by night’s blurring of the line between danger and security in dreamy peaches, pinks and magentas. 
Group Show: “Luncheon on the Grass” – Jeffrey Deitch (Feb. 19 – Apr. 23)
“Luncheon on the Grass” at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in Mid-City enters a conversation started over 150 years ago by Édouard Manet’s iconoclast masterpiece “Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe,” considered by many to be the first modernist painting. The show includes works from icons such as Diane Arbus, Jeff Koons and Kehinde Wiley, in addition to rising stars such as Ariana Papademetropoulos, Salman Toor and Dominique Fung. The multimedia exhibition interrogates Manet’s mysterious original depicting two men seated in conversation accompanied at a picnic by a nude woman who peers deeply over her shoulder into the unrelenting eyes of the ever-intrusive viewer.

This review contains spoilers.
At the top of the night, when the audience at the Scene Dock Theatre was told by an overly charismatic announcer over the loudspeaker to enjoy the evening’s “title match,” they knew they were going to be in for a treat.
“Blade to the Heat” written by Oliver Mayer, professor of dramatic writing and associate dean at the School of Dramatic Arts, opened this semester’s show season with a bang, brought to audiences by SDA’s very own MFA Repertory year three students. 
The play follows Pedro Quinn (Cameron Murphy)’s journey through the boxing world of the Black and Indigenous people of color community in 1959, as he struggles with his image and sexuality while constantly being bombarded by toxic hypermasculinity. 
With most of the action set in the boxing ring, director and fight choreographer Edgar Landa, who also works as an SDA faculty member, distinguishes different scenes through incredibly subtle changes in staging. 
Right off the bat, the show begins with imitation singer Garnet (Stephen Humes) in the midst of his performance on a makeshift stage, depicted through the opening of sliding doors further upstage from the boxing ring. While serenading the audience with his live vocals throughout the majority of the play, Humes’ background is splashed with color, from blue to pink, courtesy of lighting designer Josh Epstein, another SDA faculty member, to indicate the switch from a dingy old boxing arena to a more lively club setting.
Epstein’s lighting prowess is also essential to the success of the inevitable fight sequences in this boxing-inspired production. During Pedro’s match to compete against his boxing rival Mantequilla (Kumar Rohit) for the champion title, audiences are subject to the emphasis on the intensity, and intimacy, between the two fighters. To highlight this, a special light that lines the perimeter of the boxing ring switches on to indicate that a fight is in progress, and switches off when the story moves into a different scene outside of the boxing arena, or to simply show that there is no fight in progress. 
During the actual matches, however, Landa creates intensity and intimacy between the fighters through the use of slow motion. 
Slow motion, often seen in action films, is objectively challenging to carry out on stage, considering how audiences have to put in more effort to willingly suspend their disbelief during a show and it is much more entertaining to see two people fight if it looks real. Landa solves this problem by having the actors perfectly time their movements, implementing smooth transitions between actions with different speeds.
On the topic of intimacy, deep relationships between multiple characters riddle the show. The actors’ chemistry between Jack (John Stephens) and Alacran (Oscar Enrique Gonzales Torres), and the struggle between ill-fated lovers Pedro and Garnet, whose relationship was ripe with sexual tension. 
Notably, in scenes that take place outside the boxing ring, such as a passionate encounter between Pedro and Garnet, Murphy and Humes keep the same intensity and intimacy between themselves as if they were in a match. Both balance how much energy to give the audience at any given moment, and ultimately find the right combination to keep the audience silently engaged and empathetic.
“Blade to the Heat” tackles issues present within the BIPOC community and the queer community. The monologues given by Jack and Alacran toward the end of the show give audiences insight into the absence of choice members within these communities endure when fighting to survive in society at large. The play’s usage of a boxing metaphor also implies that, although BIPOC individual’s constantly have to fight for themselves, following the boxing ring metaphor their efforts to survive are often seen as pure entertainment for their white counterparts. 
Overarching the play’s plot, “Blade to the Heat” reveals that BIPOC communities are heavily embedded with hypermasculine expectations. Much of this concern fuels the show’s action, primarily through Pedro’s storyline. For Pedro, the audience follows not only his journey through the BIPOC boxing world, but also through consequences he faces (and relationships unfortunately destroyed) as a result of being queer in a hypermasculine profession. 
Although the play successfully addresses issues that are not otherwise the center of attention in most theater pieces in a white-dominated industry, Pedro’s arc could be viewed as falling into the trope of queer unhappiness, especially with a lack of empowering queer stories on stage as it is.
Overall, despite its missed opportunity to empower the queer community through Pedro’s character, “Blade to the Heat” successfully tackles issues of importance that members within the BIPOC community face everyday.

Hearing her friend complain about their messy apartment, Mila Vipond, who loves cleaning, jokingly told her, “I’ll do it for you.” But what started out as an offhand comment said in passing grew into a full-fledged cleaning operation for student living spaces with 15 clients, a mix of one-timers and regulars. From piles of overflowing dishes in the sink to rust-stained bathtubs lined with moldy bath mats to mountains of laundry mountains, Vipond and Kaitlin Schachter, her business partner and co-founder of Tidy Trojans, have seen it all. 
In line with their mission statement, Vipond, a sophomore majoring in business administration, and Schachter, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said they started their company to reduce the time their peers spend on cleaning so they can “free up their time and make the most of their college experience.”
“I feel like a lot of times in college, there’s so much going on, especially with the academic portion and balancing that with the social life, but there’s a lot to do,” Schachter said. “The last thing you want to do is spend that little bit of free time that you might have in your busy schedule cleaning up your apartment, so through our company, we do that for you, so you can have more time to live your life and go do the things that you want to be doing.”
Tidy Trojans was founded last November, closed for winter break and reopened in late January. Vipond is in charge of the cleaning, while Schachter runs the company’s social media accounts. 
After the visit to their friend’s apartment, Vipond said Tidy Trojans began on a “whim.” 
“Literally that same night … I started drawing a logo for us,” Vipond said. “It took me like until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. where we’re just talking about it … The following day, I got up at 9:30 a.m. and within a span of four hours, I had put together a website, created social media pages and basically put us on the map.”
The very next day, Tidy Trojans had its first appointment. 
Minjoo Koo, a junior majoring in business administration and art history, and her housemates decided to hire Tidy Trojans to clean their apartment, who she said transformed their “disorganized” space. In only a span of an hour, Koo said the entire place became “really clean.” 
“I would totally recommend it to other people,” Koo said. “Especially to people who don’t really clean their apartment.”
Tidy Trojans charges $30 for the first hour and $20 for every subsequent hour. Students can book an appointment through Tidy Trojans’ website or Instagram page. 
Jeneva Lindsey, a graduate student studying social work, discovered Tidy Trojans from a flyer hanging in her apartment building. As someone who has a hard time keeping her space clean when she’s stressed, Lindsey said using Tidy Trojans’ services freed up her time to focus on other things.
“I definitely needed the help,” Lindsey said. “I was literally in class while she did the laundry … I could definitely feel a responsibility being lifted off of me.”
Vipond said that an important part of her work is helping people stay stress-free. On her first job, she remembers feeling initially overwhelmed by the mess she’d have to clean but, by the end, felt satisfied with her work. 
“There were pots and pans in the sink that had been in there so long, they rusted and started to rust through the sink,” Vipond said. “They had never used the dishwasher; there was still Styrofoam in it from when it was initially put in. They had never cleaned their bathrooms and toilets.”
After the two and a half hours Vipond spent cleaning, she said the place was “spotless.” Vipond said she noticed every time she returned, the owners were able to maintain it better and better.  
As Vipond transports all her own supplies riding her scooter, Tidy Trojans serve a two-mile radius outside of USC’s campus. When the University lifts the no-guest rule for campus housing Mar. 1 as communicated in a Feb. 18 email to USC Housing residents, Vipond said Tidy Trojans will also be available to those who live on campus. 
Through her work at Tidy Trojans, Vipond said she’s realized how challenging it is for students to keep their living spaces clean. 
“I”ve learned that most people want to live in a clean space, but many were never taught the proper ways to clean or know what products to use,” she said. 
Vipond said that the greatest challenge of staying on top of cleaning is not letting chores, like laundry or dishes, pile up as the more there is, the more daunting it is to clean it. 
“Just as a starting point for everyone is to take five minutes a day and just say, ‘Okay, I’m going to take this five minutes and tidy up my room,’” she said. “At least twice a week, I’m going to do laundry instead of once every two weeks.”

Linda Evangelista was a name impossible to forget in the ’90s. She was the true, pivotal and influential icon — one of the top supermodels at the turn of the century. 
She was even part of a group that included five other major supermodels of the time: Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford.
Starting her career in 1984 under Elite Model Management, Evangelista quickly rose to fame. In her career, she graced over 700 magazine covers and walked for every major fashion brand. She had a haircut named after her, was iconic photographer Steven Meisel’s muse and coined the it-girl phrase: “We don’t wake up for less than $10,000 a day.”
Still, even as time and fashion changed, the model within her never left. In August 2015, to preserve her youthful looks, she booked an appointment at CoolSculpting, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure that works to freeze fat. Those who tend to use this procedure target stubborn fat and often freeze their stomachs, thighs or chin. 
However, what made this a nightmare for Evangelista is that she experienced a rare side effect that affects less than 1% of cool sculpting users: paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, or PAH. 
So, instead of the fat freezing and going away, PAH causes the tissue to expand, thicken and eventually harden to a point where liposuction may not even work. 
Evangelista became extremely self-conscious and scared to run into people due to the pressure she faced to remain youthful looking. According to her exclusive interview with People, she felt that “she’s lost her identity.” While she ended up going through the liposuction procedure and is now in a legal battle with Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc., the parent company — her story isn’t something new. 
Obviously, cosmetic procedures go wrong all the time – that’s why there’s literally a TV show called “Botched.” But there is such a double standard with aging. 
For men, growing old is natural. The silver and gray hairs are trophies of hard work, effort and fruits of life. As men age, especially in fashion and Hollywood, they are compared to ‘fine wine,’ with their beard stubble and true masculinity finally coming in perfect harmony.
But women are suddenly ‘old’ once they are the age of 30.  
We are pushed to lather our faces with endless serums, masks and creams that claim to “get rid of fine lines” and “de-age” our faces, and, even at 18 years old, I had friends bring up preventative botox. 
There is an enormous stigma that women cannot age. 
Unless we are long-time Hollywood legends that can afford ongoing high-end treatment and whose job description is to remain flawless and have every fine line ooze with grace, wisdom and femininity, we non-stars are supposedly frumpy, behind-schedule and succumbing to the pressures of life.
Women, too, age beautifully, and as we grow, so do our wits and knowledge of life; we, too, get to drink nectar from the fruit that we were told only men get to enjoy.
Aging is life. It is progression and growth and an extension of ourselves, so why does it have to be a shameful thing? 
I love my frown lines, the little swan-dives in my skin from stretch marks and this one dip in my arm from my vaccine in Japan. 
When we fire something in the kiln and it’s paint chips a little, it’s not like the dish is immediately flawed. Instead, we tend to observe and pick in awe of the uniqueness and individuality of our creation. So why don’t we view bodies the same way? 
Our skin is malleable and effortless, molded like clay by nurturing hands and warm hearts – isn’t that just the most exciting and beautiful thing?
So who cares if you have a little laugh line or not-baby-bottom-smooth skin under your eyes? It is your character, it is your story and it is you. 
We all age like fine wine, and no one can convince me otherwise.

President Joe Biden’s efforts to accelerate progress against cancer include an $18.5 million grant to a team of researchers at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The White House’s Cancer Moonshot initiative aims to decrease the mortality rate of cancer by 50% in the next 25 years. The National Cancer Institute will fund USC researchers’ five-year plan to target the medical field’s lack of knowledge about colorectal cancer in Latinx communities.
Led by John Carpten, professor and chair of translational genomics at the Keck School of Medicine, and Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz, associate director for clinical research at Keck, the team will collect crucial information on cancer genome sequencing and participation engagement in a long-term study with 500 participants.
“The overall goals of the center are to develop processes and approaches to engage Hispanic patients with colorectal cancer into genomic studies,” said Mariana Carla Stern, co-leader of the patient engagement unit. “The second goal of the center is to contribute novel data on tumor characteristics for colorectal cancer among Hispanics and also germline mutations among Hispanic patients.”
In the past 20 years, researchers from across the globe have rapidly progressed scientific understanding of cancer’s onset and treatment, but marginalized communities have felt a deficiency in both areas, Stern said. The USC Center for Optimization of Participant Engagement for Cancer Characterization intends to close this gap.
“Most of the studies that have been done to understand the human landscape of cancer have not included Hispanic individuals,” Stern said. “Therefore, we know a lot less about the characteristics of tumors among Hispanics than we know about the characteristics of tumors among non-Hispanic [white people].”
According to a 2019 study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinx patients exhibit a significantly higher mortality rate from various forms of cancer than their non-Latinx counterparts. 
“This disparity that we see in terms of research among Hispanics is really prevalent across many other areas of medicine,” Stern said.
To address this general disparity, USC researchers will be engaging with research participants to broaden the scope of their study. Stern and her patient engagement team will use this five-year window as a foundation to understand the impact of their research and the unique cultural interactions between the Latinx community and the medical field.
Stern said that the team will be asking about patients’ experiences navigating the study and following up with their results a year after the delivery of genetic information. Additionally, the team will gather data on the attitudes of Latinx participants towards clinical trials, with goals to engage the community in future research projects.
Biden’s Moonshot funding campaign engages five other centers across the country — Broad Institute Research Center, Washington University Research Center, Ohio State University Coordinating Center, Yale University Research Center and University of New Mexico and TGen Research Center — that will gather critical information on other types of cancer and communities to contribute to this ambitious project.
“[Many] people in this consortium are working with different racial and ethnic minorities of different kinds, some with Hispanics, as well as others with American Indians, others with other groups,” said Lourdes Baez Conde, professor of preventive medicine at Keck and leader of the engagement optimization unit. “The idea is that we’re going to learn from each other … how to best approach this in these unique populations that have not traditionally participated in research at the level that other people have.”
The findings from this funding project will open the doors for progress in other areas of medicine, and for other marginalized groups who also lack critical representation in medical research, Lenz said.
By the end of the five-year research effort, Lenz and his team at NCI hope to gain a stronger grasp on the onset and treatment of cancer in Latinx populations, but this is only the first step of many in closing the gap between representation and understanding of cancer in Latinx communities, Lenz said. USC’s research team is optimistic that their efforts will create a foundation for this extensive field of study.
“[The Moonshot fund] will really generate lots of both systemic and patient-centered changes that will make a difference in terms of resolving some of the major health disparities that we see in cancer at the moment,” Baez Conde said. “It’s going to really ignite the field in a new way.”

Sitting at 10-2 on the season, men’s volleyball is off to a strong start in its 2022 campaign. The Trojans currently rank No. 5 in the country and are in a prime position to earn an NCAA Tournament bid. After a two-week hiatus, USC is back in action Wednesday night when they visit No. 7 Pepperdine in the first of a two-match series. 
With the Trojans around halfway through their season, here’s a look at four of USC’s biggest contributors thus far.
Graduate student libero Cole Paxson
Graduate student libero Cole Paxson slots into the USC lineup as an important defensive piece. 2022 marks his fourth year starting as libero for the Trojans, playing a key role as a veteran on the team. 
Paxson currently leads the team with 99 digs on the season, holding down the defense. Additionally, his 23 assists are good for second-best on the team. His two-way play will be instrumental moving forward for the Trojans.
Graduate student opposite hitter/outside hitter/setter Sam Kobrine
After transferring from UCLA after the 2021 season, graduate student opposite hitter Sam Kobrine has been like a Swiss Army knife for the Trojans this season, doing a bit of everything. He is currently second on the team in both kills with 142 and service aces with 14. Kobrine’s 13 assists are also good for third among USC players, while his 50 digs and 13 blocks both rank fifth among this year’s Trojans.
Kobrine is just one of two USC players to rank in the top five among the team in all five major statistical categories. The Trojans will need his versatility if they want to continue their strong run down the stretch.
Redshirt sophomore opposite hitter 
Simon Gallas
After opting out of the 2021 season, redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Gallas has returned in full force for the Trojans in 2022. He currently leads the team in both kills, with 183, and service aces, with 17.
In addition to his offensive attack, Gallas has been a key for USC on defense as well. Through the first 12 matches of the season, Gallas has 61 digs and 27 blocks, both good for third-most on the team.
Along with Kobrine, Gallas is the only other Trojans to rank in the top five among the team in all five major statistics. Consistent play across the board has characterized Gallas’ 2022 campaign.
Redshirt senior setter Chris Hall
Any time that a player is leading his team in a major statistic, they must be doing something right. When a player has more than 20 times as many assists as the player with the next-most on the team, they must be doing a lot of things right.
That has been exactly the case with redshirt senior setter Chris Hall this season. The fifth-year starter has racked up an incredible 478 assists through the first 12 matches of the 2022 season, compared to the second-most on the team at 23.
Hall’s production at the setter position has been vital towards the Trojans’ success this season. If USC is to make a push toward the program’s fifth NCAA-recognized National Championship, Hall will need to continue to lead the way.

Men and women’s swim will compete in the Pac-12 Swimming Championship over the next two weeks after a competitive dual-meet season. Both teams stand at a 5-2 record, with their only two losses against highly ranked teams in the collegiate competition: UC Berkeley and Stanford. 
The men’s team wrapped up its regular season with a win against Utah last weekend, finishing with 164.5 points over Utah’s 96.5 points. Among the 12 wins earned by the Trojans were two dominant relays, the 200-yard medley relay and the 400-yard freestyle relay. The 200-yard medley — swam by sophomore Vaggelis Makrygiannis, fifth year Trent Pellini, redshirt senior Nikola Miljenic and freshman Artem Selin — took first with a 1:26.50. In the 400-yard freestyle relay, the Trojans took the win with a 2:57.20, swam by Selin, Miljenic, Pellini and junior Max Saunders. 
A decisive win against UCLA last weekend, which included the Trojans setting three pool records and winning seven events, has the women’s team feeling confident about future competition outside of the dual meet season. 
Women’s team captain senior Isabelle Odgers’ spirits are high regarding the end of the dual meet season.
“We had a super dominant victory over UCLA this year which was also really exciting and inspiring for us just moving into [the Pac-12 Championship] this next week,” Odgers said.
The 200-yard medley relay was one of three swims that broke records last weekend against the Bruins. Swam by fifth year Calypso Sheridan, sophomore Kaitlyn Dobler, sophomore Anicka Delgado and senior Laticia Transom, the relay team finished with a 1:35.32. Individually, Transom set the next pool record in the 100-yard freestyle, finishing with a 47.62, and Sheridan took another record in the 200-yard breaststroke, finishing with a 2:07.18. 
This season, the entire team will be able to attend the championships for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.
“It’ll just be fun to have the whole team there together again,” Odgers said. “I think one of the things that we’re always really great at is bringing really great energy, and we’re always the loudest team on deck at [the Pac-12 Championship] which is something that we hope to maintain for this year too.” 
Senior team captain Makenna Turner views the championships as an opportunity to celebrate her team after a long season.
“That’s honestly the best part,” Turner said. “All the hard work is over, and now, it’s like you just get to put on a fast suit with your best friends and race your butt off and enjoy seeing each other’s success and our success for the end of the season. We’re really looking forward to that as well.” 
Ahead of a long awaited postseason, the Trojans will be back in Federal Way, Wash. for their championship meets, with the women’s team swimming Feb. 23 through Feb. 26 and the men’s team swimming Mar. 2 through Mar. 5.
