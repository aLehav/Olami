The USC men’s golf team dominated several top-ranked teams including No. 1 Pepperdine, No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 6 Texas in the 15-team field at UNLV’s Southern Highlands Collegiate Sunday through Tuesday in Las Vegas.
Despite enduring three days of harsh conditions at Southern Highlands, the Trojans came out on top with a total combined team score of 3-under 861 (287-283-291) for all three rounds.
The victory in Las Vegas is the men’s first overall team victory this season. Leading the Trojans was freshman Yuxin Lin, who maintained the lead with two 67s (10-under) and made it to a playoff for the individual title.
Lin just fell short to Texas sophomore Parker Coody in the playoff, ending with a 74 on the final round, but his 67 was one of his best performances of his season — his sixth round in the 60s.
Lin and junior Issei Tanabe contributed to two of the Trojans’ top 10 individual finishes of the tournament. Tanabe successfully battled on the second day and ended the tournament with a 69 and a 2-under total 214 (71-74-69).
The team’s improved wedge game helped it seize numerous birdie opportunities even with the change in altitude and heavy winds, giving USC the advantage over its opponents.
“Coach prepared us well for the tournament,” Tanabe said after finishing his best performance of the season. “Every one of us contributed to a part of this win. We all had our moments and whatever we did during each round, each hole and each shot specifically, we were all focused 100%. That’s why we won.”
A crucial birdie on 18 from sophomore Cameron Henry elevated USC to a three-stroke advantage before Lin’s last hole. Henry finished 25th with a 3-over 219 (72-70-77) while junior Leon D’Souza tied for 67th at 14-over 230 (79-72-79).
The team had been close to victory before in this spring season as the Trojans tied for second in the Southwestern Invitational with a total of 3-over 837 (299-289-279). Southern Highlands was different right out of the gate, as the Trojans came in hot and never let go of the lead.
Head coach Chris Zambri and assistant coach Bobby Gojuangco have established a philosophy of entering every match with no expectations to allow the players to go in clear-headed. That mentality seemed to pay off in Las Vegas, and USC will hope to keep its momentum moving forward.
“At some point, we are going to have to start playing well,” Zambri said. “They were ready this week. Their games were good. The conditions were really tough, and the guys did unbelievably well. We have just enough guys in our lineup who don’t mind the wind and it paid off for us.”
USC will have more than a week off before traveling to Tucson, Ariz. during spring break for the National Invitational Tournament March 16 and 17.

A revolution is coming to college football. It will come slowly, painfully and over the course of many generations of struggle and injustice, but a storm of revolt is set to hit the shores of the college football world.
This wave of rebellion will come in a variety of forms: name, image, likeness rights, renewed television deals and potential alterations to the College Football Playoff. Above all, however, it will be the newest round of conference realignment that will set the tone for all the other issues in the sport. 
Few teams sit in as interesting a position as USC.
It is no secret that the Trojans and the Pac-12 have been on distinctly poor terms in recent years. Starting at the calamity that is the Pac-12 Networks and stretching down to the industry’s most notoriously incompetent referees, the conference’s football outlook is most optimistically regarded as bottoming out. For many others, however, the Pac-12’s gridiron brand is only set to deteriorate further despite advances by programs like Oregon and Washington.
All of this is to say that the conference’s premier football brand, USC, is going to at least consider all available options with regards to conference alignment. Athletic director Mike Bohn implied as much when he went on a USCFootball.com podcast and said “everything’s on the table” with regards to USC’s future. While Bohn would go on to clarify his comments as they related more specifically to future TV deals in the Pac-12, this purported slip of the tongue gives a solid insight into the growing friction and distance between the conference and its elite member programs. With hundreds of millions of dollars and a century-long legacy of dominance hanging in the balance, anything is possible.
On Wednesday, Andy Staples of The Athletic proposed a growingly popular idea that USC (as well as UCLA, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Arizona State) should bolt for the Big 12 at the next inevitable stage of conference realignments in coming seasons. Certainly, Staples provides a solid argument as he details the history of conference rivalries and competition for programs, as well as the opportunities that the Big 12 offers in terms of financially competitive rewards for elite programs. In many ways, the Big 12 represents the caliber of a conference that could potentially compete with the Big Ten and SEC, whose grip on the college football (and basketball) worlds are tightening annually. USC is a football school and, without a doubt, where the team goes, the school and athletics often follow.
All that said, the greenest pastures for USC’s athletic department as a whole still clearly reside in the Pac-12.
For as much as the Pac-12 is being nationally embarrassed in the “money” sports of football and basketball, it is still a conference that prides itself on its Olympic prowess. Not only does the conference dominate in sports such as track and field and gymnastics, but sports such as water polo nearly completely comprise Pac-12 teams. Considering USC’s obvious dedication to excellence in Olympic sports — regardless of the struggles in Galen Center or the Coliseum — continuing to compete at the highest level in these sports is a major consideration for USC regarding any conference movement. While Big 12 schools such as Texas have put together solid programs in Olympic sports, they still lag considerably behind the “Conference of Champions.”
In addition to the likely protest of the balance of sports programs on campus, USC would also be adding considerable amounts of travel to the schedules of each of these teams. In joining a conference that stretches as far east as West Virginia, travel expenses would rise astronomically as compared to a conference where most play is concentrated on the Western seaboard.
Lastly, the Big 12 is a complete catastrophe academically compared to the Pac-12. Considering the interest of President Carol Folt and others to maintain USC’s sharp upward academic trajectory and remain competitive with fellow elite California universities, a move to the Big 12 would be a legitimate downgrade for the school as an academic brand. Simply put, a conference that hosts one school ranked in the top 50 in the nation compared to one that has four would clearly be seen by a university such as USC as an obvious downgrade.
Talk of USC leaving the Pac-12 will not slow down anytime soon. From prognostications like Staples’ that claim the Trojans could join the Big 12 to suggestions that USC could follow Notre Dame into football independence, this time of revolution will certainly aim to keep programs across the country on their toes. 
Despite the appeal of a drastic change, however, USC is still best served to stay the course amid the storm.

The USC baseball team failed to get on the scoreboard until it was too late Tuesday evening, falling to UC Irvine 5-1. The Trojans are now riding a three-game losing streak against the Anteaters.
Neither team was particularly sharp at the plate as the teams combined for 21 strikeouts and no extra-base hits aside from the lone home run of the evening from UCI.
“Where we didn’t go well tonight was our offense,” head coach Jason Gill said after the game. “We struck out 10 times on a Tuesday. I’ll tip my cap to their pitcher but we have to do better than that.”
Despite the outcome, junior lefty Brian Gursky pitched well in his second appearance on the hill for the Trojans this season, his first coming in USC’s 7-1 win at Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 25. Gursky pitched six hitless innings, striking out six of the first nine batters he faced.
“[Gursky] had command of three pitches,” Gill said. “He was down in the strike zone, so when they did put the ball in play it was usually chopped ground balls at our middle infield. He was great.”
The junior lefty’s troubles came in the sixth, however, as UCI managed to load the bases on Gursky without recording a hit. An error, a hit by pitch and an intentional walk loaded the bases with just one out for the Anteaters in the top half of the inning. Gursky worked out of the jam to limit UCI to just one run on a deep sacrifice fly in his final inning of work. 
Gursky, unlucky to find himself in line for a loss after such a strong performance, was relieved by sophomore righty Ethan Reed in the seventh inning. The game was broken open shortly after by way of a 3-run homer by senior outfielder John Jensen to put UCI up 4-0.
At the plate, the Trojans had difficulties catching up to UCI’s starter, freshman lefty Nick Pinto, who limited USC to just two hits and no runs over his six innings of work. 
“I think we have the best hitting team in the [Pac-12], hands down,” Gursky said. “You can’t bring your hitting every day, but our guys no doubt are going to bounce back.”
UCI tacked on an additional insurance run in the top half of the ninth, extending its lead to 5-0 heading into the final half-inning. The Trojans tacked on a run in the ninth, but their comeback attempt fell short as they finished the game with just four hits combined over nine innings. 
“It’s definitely a learning experience, all of us are new together,” Gill said. “So we’re all kind of learning together, so I think they’re frustrated. I’m frustrated a little bit.” 
The loss moves the Trojans to a mark of 4-4 at home this season and 7-4 overall.
“At the end of the game we didn’t give up, we got a run right there at the end,” Gursky said. “We wish we got the win but at the end of the day there’s some positives we can learn from and take going forward into a tough weekend we’re about to have.” 
USC will be back in action starting Friday in the annual Southern California College Baseball Classic in Los Angeles against a stacked lineup of elite programs.
The Trojans will host three ranked opponents over the weekend, facing off against No. 22 TCU Friday and No. 2 Vanderbilt Saturday before a matchup with crosstown rival No. 6 UCLA at Dedeaux Field Sunday.
TCU comes in at 10-2 overall after sweeping Cal in a three-game series last weekend. The 2019 NCAA Champion Vanderbilt Commodores head into the weekend’s trio of games at 11-3 overall on the season with just one loss in their last 11 games. UCLA will come into the weekend looking to avenge its first loss this season, falling to UCSB on Tuesday. The Bruins still carry an 11-1 record and remain a favorite to compete for the Pac-12 title this year.
USC kicks off the action Friday against TCU. First pitch is set for 6 p.m., Saturday’s game will start at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s weekend finale begins at 3 p.m.

After a 16-13 regular season and an 8-10 Pac-12 record, the USC women’s basketball team is getting set for its first matchup of the Pac-12 Tournament. Entering as a No. 7 seed, USC will play against No. 10 Colorado in Las Vegas  Thursday. This marks the beginning of postseason play for the Trojans, who are coming off a three-game winning streak, including a win over the Buffaloes in Sunday’s regular season finale.
USC in recent years has struggled to break into the second round of the Pac-12 Tournament. In the last four seasons, the Trojans have only moved past the first round twice.
The Pac-12 is one of the toughest conferences in the NCAA and the tournament’s stacked field reflects that. But head coach Mark Trakh has shown a glimpse of the ability to lead his team far, going into the then-Pac-10 finals with his 2008-09 squad before falling to Stanford. Trakh hasn’t broken past the second round since his return to USC in 2017, but that could change with a team that has seen a late-season uptick.
This year’s first round will be the deciding game for who wins the season series between USC and Colorado. The Trojans lost their first match to the Buffaloes 66-53 in the midst of their early five-game conference losing streak. While they made it up at Galen Center last weekend with a 66-55 win, the recent history does not guarantee a win for a team that has faltered on the road this season.
USC is 4-8 away from its home crowd. A lack of adjustment to the demands of conference play and travel could be the reason behind this paltry road record, with the majority of the eight losses coming early while the seven freshmen on the team were transitioning from high school to collegiate level basketball. 
The Buffaloes are coming in with a comparable 6-7 away record but are looking for a team ready to avenge its average regular season, which ended with a two-game losing streak.
“We just gotta study Colorado play and anticipate any adjustments, and then we gotta make a few,” Trakh said. “But Colorado is very good. It’s going to be tough playing somebody back-to-back like that.”
USC will depend on its star freshmen, who have become forces in the Pac-12 already. Freshman guard Endyia Rogers has dropped double-digit points in 18 games this season, averaging 12.8 per game.
Rogers’ 2.7 assists per game have aided the new Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, forward Alissa Pili, who has been the scoring anchor for the Trojans and figures to play that role in Vegas. Pili had an unprecedented regular season for USC, earning Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors four times. The true freshman has proven unstoppable even against the NCAA’s best defenses — logging double digits in scoring against several ranked opponents — and is a top-five rebounder in the conference. 
Four teams have first-round byes in the tournament, meaning if USC moves past Colorado it will have a showdown with crosstown rival No. 8 UCLA. In the midst of a 1-1 season series after a double-overtime win at Galen Center in January — UCLA’s first loss of the season — this game could be a testament to how far the young team has developed over the season — should the Trojans advance.
“There’s no excuse to not try that hard because this is what we’ve been waiting for,” senior forward Kayla Overbeck said. “This is the chance to win as many games as we can so we can go to the NCAA Tournament.”
The Trojans tip off against Colorado Thursday at 6 p.m. The game will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.

I am a proud Drug Abuse Resistance Education graduate, Class of 2011. I remember chanting the pedagogic anthem: 
“D, I won’t do drugs,” impounding the lyrics so deeply that today I could whip out the rap break on demand. “A, won’t have an attitude,” yet I indeed had one. “R, I will respect myself” — that which I’m still learning to do.
On that note, let’s talk about drugs! Psychoactive compounds, to be exact. In all honesty, I have never dabbled in psychedelic drugs — I am a D.A.R.E. graduate after all. However, I recently read “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan, and I have not been able to shut up about it. In his expose on psychedelics, Pollan documents his transcendental experiences with LSD, psilocybin and DMT to explore the neurochemistry and controlled, medicinal implementation of these substances. 
Coined “The Third Wave of psychedelics,” this renaissance of experimentation focuses on the upside of psychoactive drugs, specifically with their application in mental illness treatment. Despite these obvious benefits, our culture cannot surpass this stigma that labels these substances as alien perils. In order to transition to a society that fully moves past the negative implications of hippie culture, psychedelics must be normalized as a medical advancement integral to mental illness treatment. 
When we hear the phrase “dropping acid,” we immediately think of the counterculture essentials: flower print, Volkswagen buses and religiously-doled-out peace signs. In light of the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, anti-establishment culture promoted several progressive ideologies, including environmentalism, feminism, gay liberation and even psychoactive drug experimentation. 
Considered forms of radicalism at the time, environmentalism and feminism are more readily accepted today. Emerging scientific and sociological evidence, such as climate change and the gender wage gap respectively, substantiate these movements. We do not even associate these developments with the 1960s counterculture anymore — they are just progressivism. 
The psychedelic movement follows a different story. In the ’60s, American psychologist Timothy Leary often considered the “Pied Piper of psychedelics,” conducted the Harvard Psilocybin Project, which assessed the long-term effects of psilocybin, the compound derived from “shrooms,” on graduate students and prisoners. 
While these clinical trials pioneered the psychedelic research realm, they simultaneously derailed it. Long story short, loosely regulated protocol — along with some bad trips — resulted in widespread hysteria across the U.S. and a consequential shutdown of all other psychedelic research projects. By the end of the decade, psychoactive drugs, especially LSD, were commonly stigmatized as media of chaos being abused by hippies and degenerate youths alike. 
To this day, LSD remains tethered to hippie culture of the ’60s, so much that psychedelics still relay negative connotations. “Tripping on acid” emanates recklessness and aimlessness. “Rolling” recreationally parallels rave culture and its wild implications. 
Meanwhile, these predispositions subvert the revitalization of psychedelic therapy in the medical realm. Phase three clinical trials are underway for the use of MDMA — ecstasy or molly, if you will — in treating PTSD. The FDA designated “breakthrough therapy” status to psilocybin as a means to treat major depressive disorder, or MDD. A 2014 study at Johns Hopkins University supported that psilocybin may also aid in smoking cessation. 
If this idea of psychiatric treatment is not radicalized anymore, such as what has occurred with women’s rights, climate activism and gay rights, psychedelics must be standardized so that their existence does not imply destructive deviance. Besides, this deviance is a socially constructed binary pitting good against bad. It stems from the spread of false, hyperbolized information and a resulting criminalization of these drugs — the government still classifies LSD and ecstasy as Schedule I substances, meaning they have no accepted medicinal potential and carry a risk of abuse. 
Accredited research suggests otherwise, meaning our social makeup needs to reciprocate by supporting the potential for change. Destigmatizing mental health also means destigmatizing mental health treatment, and these revolutionary findings in the field of neuropharmacology should not be contingent upon its history. It is time to reverse these counter currents and accept their principles as necessary and catalytic to the future of medicine. 
Like the iconic D.A.R.E. slogan concludes — “E, I will educate me now” — we should indeed follow suit, but from this new angle that gives proper credit to the irrefutable benefits of psychoactive drugs.

The Undergraduate Student Government recently proposed a restructuring of its internal branches, essentially combining the six existing branches into three: executive, legislative and judicial. In this reconfiguration, all of the preexisting branches fit nicely into the overarching new ones — well, all except for the advocacy branch. In fact, USG’s proposal seems to ignore the advocacy branch, citing “overlap” between it and the legislative branch of government as reason to remove it. 
In getting rid of the advocacy branch, USG would be removing a space for students to directly work with administration and communicate about various issues affecting USC students. Holding Senate meetings to discuss issues surrounding the community is an effective way to interact with students, but without it, there is no liaison meant to also work with the administration. The advocacy branch is specifically dedicated to giving students and administrators a chance to work directly with USG. As such, the advocacy branch must not be removed during any restructuring of student government.
Like the other branches, the advocacy branch serves its own unique purpose within USG, which is “staying in close contact with key administrators and students about issues affecting students that lie in their area of focus.” Essentially, the branch addresses prominent concerns among the student body and works to make students aware of the resources available to them. Some of the areas of work include academic affairs, accessibility affairs, sustainability affairs and wellness affairs.
Certainly, these are all important issues. In the case of wellness affairs, it is essential that students are made aware of resources available to them. On the other hand, it is equally important that the administration is in contact with USG about student concerns. This is not an issue that can be satisfied simply by putting all of our energy into creating new legislation — it instead concerns the general upkeep and spread of public information among the USC community.
Despite the work that the advocacy branch has done in these areas, the proposed plan states that the legislative body will supposedly replace the advocacy branch of student government. As USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin explained in a Senate Meeting last month, “[USG] wanted to make [their] organization a bit more legislative-focused in terms of putting forward more resolutions and proposals because that’s a primary role of the Senate.” 
There is nothing wrong with wanting to effect long-lasting or permanent change at USC. Particularly within the realms of wellness and sustainability, long-needed legislative changes certainly have the potential to benefit the community. However, the purpose of having these six separate branches in the first place is to divvy up the roles and responsibilities within USG. In adding advocacy work to the legislative branch, the organization is simply piling more work onto the legislators’ plates. Who’s to say that this work will actually get done if there are fewer roles dedicated to it?
There must be room within USG for student issues to be heard by the administration and for information to be spread throughout the community. In removing the advocacy branch of government, the proposed restructuring of USG does away with any sort of space for this. In sum: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

 When a player opens the Detour Bus video game, they enter an alternate reality, founders Zachary Flores and Ezra Robinson said. With goggles on, they are launched into an imaginary American landscape, packed with defining elements of the 1970s: flowers, a hippie van and hot lava are just the beginning. 
Flores and Robinson created Detour Bus, a video game where the player navigates a yellow Volkswagen bus on a family road trip across America, and simultaneously build a road by placing 3D blocks on the floor through virtual reality.   
Flores, a junior majoring in computer science (games), and Robinson, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, started developing the game in Fall 2019 as part of their “Intermediate Game Design and Development” class. In the class, which was taught by Cinematic Arts professors Peter Brinson and Jesse Vigil, students work in teams and conceptualize innovative design goals by creating their own video game.
Flores and Robinson aimed to create a VR game for adults and children alike that captures the child-like excitement of playing with toys.
“The real goal is to inspire the same sense of wonder that a kid has building a giant Hot Wheels track or those wooden train sets … and capture that in a way that can happen in real life,” Robinson said.
Using a VR headset and two controllers, players face challenges and reach different destinations by arranging pieces of the road together, Flores said. Through body movements and controllers, players fit sections of the road together, ultimately taking the Volkswagen microbus twisting and turning on a forward and upside down ride. 
“Zach and Ezra figured out a really unusual and joyful puzzle game to make VR worth it,” Brinson said. “This game wouldn’t work without VR. It needs VR, but VR also needs it in a sense because we’re still waiting for there to be a lot of really wonderful VR games.”
The cast of characters includes Daddy Flowers, a payroll accountant who wishes to relive the ‘70s and does so by restoring his Volkswagen; Mama Flowers, a workaholic struggling to keep her professional and personal lives separate; Junior, a snarky advocate for communism in America; and Goldy Flowers, the bored 7-year-old sister who loves to stir up trouble by making the road trip as hard as possible for her family. 
They created these characters to reflect the general American experience and comment on the errors in the fictitious vision of the country, Robinson said. 
“Part of making the traditional American nuclear family is based on this idea of … idolizing what the ideal American experience should be,” Robinson said. “There is an attempt being made to engage with these American ideals critically and kind of use the perspectives of the kids to point out the flaws in this ideal vision of America.”
Throughout the game, the family provides commentary in the form of jokes and complaints from inside the bus. Flores and Robinson are also working on implementing voiceover that responds to the player’s actions in the game. They said one of their next steps will be to find voice actors for their team. 
The Flowers family will also make an appearance in the cutscenes between game levels. Robinson said that cutscenes, or noninteractive narrative clips in video games, are generally seen as taboo by the gaming community because they are unplayable. To combat this, the duo plans to film live actors in a renovated bus for the 360-degree virtual reality cutscenes, which will add more interaction with the cutscenes. 
Robinson said the Flowers family, both in the voiceovers and the virtual reality cutscenes filmed from within the bus, makes the game feel more personal.
“The video component … and the continual voices of the family is a really important part of [making the game feel personal] so that this feels like a human experience, not an abstract construction experience,” Robinson said. “It’s not really about building roads, even though that’s the main mechanic — it’s about guiding this family through their journey as they’re trying to reconnect with each other.”
From the microbus to the groovy flower-themed special effects, the game is infused with a 1970s feel. Robinson said that after Brinson played an incomplete demo of Detour Bus and called it a “real stoner game,” Robinson and Flores knew they had successfully communicated their theme. 
“People have nostalgia for the ‘70s, but [‘70s video games] don’t remind us of the ‘70s otherwise … because they were so primitive and simple,” Brinson said. “[Detour Bus] does a good job of simulating nostalgia for something that never happened.”
The duo hopes to be approved for USC’s Advanced Games Project, which would provide them with a team of students and greater access to faculty assistance and resources. They said that while most AGP games are 20 to 30 minutes long and are released for free, their ultimate goal is to go commercial, selling up to two hours of professional content for about $15. 
If the game is not approved, Flores and Robinson will still continue working on the project. They are applying to grants and competitions and have found faculty interested in helping them. Flores is waiting to hear back from a virtual reality grant, and last weekend, the duo attended DreamHack Anaheim, a gaming festival where they networked, demoed their game and earned an honorable mention for their game pitch. 
At the festival, Flores spoke with a game streamer for AbleGamers, a charity that provides people with disabilities accessible gaming setups. The streamer prompted Flores to think about ways to make the game accessible to those who would only be able to play with one hand. Moving forward, now in contact with the AbleGamers community, Flores and Robinson said they want to continue improving the accessibility of Detour Bus. One way they plan to do this is by creating a gameplay option that allows for a controller with two buttons, rather than two controllers with one button each, to accommodate players who can only play with one hand.
Flores said accessibility is essential for Detour Bus because they want it to be playable for people from all backgrounds.
“One of the important things about the Detour Bus … was having something more casual for people who are just starting VR for the first time,” Flores said. “There’s more and more people who don’t come from like a traditional gaming background … But, it’s also a choice for people who want to do VR but need something a little bit more accessible.”
By the time they graduate, Flores and Robinson hope to expand their creative team to no more than 10 members and have eight 10-minute-long levels.

The Undergraduate Student Government approved a resolution to relocate the Title IX Office at its meeting Tuesday, citing the inaccessibility of its current temporary location off campus on South Flower Street.
Space Manager Linda Mizushima will work with USG to find a space for the office that would be more accessible for students than the present location. The office’s permanent location, which is in the basement of Stonier Hall and is only accessible by stairs, is currently uninhabited due to a pest problem, according to the resolution. 
Members who proposed the resolution said USG should show its support for students with disabilities by specifying that the accessibility problems of the present location should be reason enough to support a move.
“There’s a lot of motivation to get Title IX out of that office,” said Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard. “Our call is to actively make it because it’s inaccessible and to make sure that the messaging is that we recognize that.”
Sens. Hailey Robertson and Haley Garland, senate aide Katelyn Lee and Howard, who wrote the Title IX resolution, said making the office accessible was especially important because Title IX exists to prevent discrimination against protected classes, including people with disabilities.
“These physical barriers disincentivize students with disabilities from filing reports of discrimination and harassment given the excess physical and emotional labor necessary for them to get equitable treatment,” the resolution stated.
The Senate voted unanimously in favor of the resolution, which will proceed to University administration for discussion and approval.
At the meeting, Sen. Emily Johnson also presented her work to establish a first-generation resource center to consolidate and improve resources for first-generation students. The Senate will send the document to University administrators, including President Carol Folt, Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Director of Campus Activities Gabriel Valenzuela.
Sen. Sara Khoshniyati discussed her initiative to implement the use of dining dollars at USC Village businesses, stating that the businesses had not been receptive to the proposal, as it would require them to discount the products they offer.
“They might implement discretionary dollars, but I don’t see them allowing dining dollars in the Village anytime soon,” Khoshniyati said. “It really goes back to businesses and how they are unwilling to grant discounts to students.”
Khoshniyati said she also hoped to expand the number of spaces on campus open to students for studying and social interaction, especially during nonbusiness hours. She said her own experience with limited late-night spaces on campus when she was a freshman helped inspire the initiative, which she hopes will include the reopening of Ground Zero Performance Café.
“Having a social life at USC comes in all different forms,” Khoshniyati said. “We want to give students an outlet to be in an environment they want to be in — one that doesn’t include going off campus.”
During the meeting, Khoshniyati also presented on her work to promote tuition assistance for continuing students from low-income backgrounds. After the University announced a new initiative last month that would grant free tuition to incoming freshmen from households making $80,000 or less per year, several students raised questions about how the new policy would affect current students.
“We need to recognize that Carol Folt has probably already evaluated the situation at hand, and there’s a good reason why she hasn’t done this,” Khoshniyati said. “They could argue … the fact that the University would have to reevaluate every student’s financial need status, but that should not be a barrier to the solution.” 
After the Senate updates and resolution proposals, President-Elect Truman Fritz presented his choices for next year’s executive cabinet. He proposed Robertson for chief of staff, discretionary fund co-director Mike Shao for treasurer and marketing director Olivia Frary for senior director of communications. The Senate will vote on the appointments next week.

USC will have to release unredacted versions of applications and emails connected to the Operation Varsity Blues admissions case to a parent in the case to provide him enough information to make a defense argument, a federal judge ruled in court Tuesday.
The order follows parent Robert Zangrillo’s June subpoena to request materials related to USC’s admissions policies. The University attempted to quash the subpoena, citing concerns over student privacy. However, the court denied the subpoena but allowed the University to omit identifying information from the documents it submitted relating to the case.
Judge Mary Page Kelley said the information the University has redacted in past documents it released to the USC parents in the college admissions case make it more difficult for the defendants to build their case. The document filed Tuesday requires USC to rerelease the documents it submitted to Zangrillo’s defense, and to other parents’ defense attorneys as deemed relevant, with no redactions. 
In Zangrillo’s case in particular, the court called the redactions “unworkable” and said documents were impossible to decipher for trial. It also found that USC had been misleading in how it presented its admissions practices and redactions 
“This makes it even more critical for Zangrillo, if he is to understand the documents, effectively and efficiently use them at trial, and potentially counter the government’s assertions about USC’s admissions process that run contrary to his defense, to see the documents without redactions,” the court order read.
The court began to investigate in December whether the redactions affected Zangrillo’s ability to construct his argument, according to court documents. His primary argument is based on the fact that, unlike in other cases in the admissions scandal, senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel did not present his daughter Amber’s athletic profile to an admissions subcommittee for approval, so the payment Robert made to the USC Athletics account should not be considered a bribe but a purported donation that resulted in USC tagging Amber’s application for special consideration. 
The University originally redacted sections of the evidence — including names, grades and test scores — to protect confidentiality, USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
“We have always cooperated with the government and the courts and make every effort to provide information, including to the defendants,” the statement read. “We provided unredacted documents to the government and the court. We are reviewing the decision in detail and deciding next steps, including whether to appeal.”
Several parents in the case, including Robert, have argued that USC issues acceptances and flags applications based on potential donations as part of its normal admissions process, making the Varsity Blues parents less culpable. Robert’s defense plans to use the documents he subpoenaed the University for in June to argue that the process by which Amber gained acceptance was a legitimate means of admission, according to court documents.
Robert has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, conspiracy to commit money laundering and aiding and abetting wire fraud and honest services wire fraud. He allegedly paid to secure Amber’s admission to USC as a women’s crew candidate following her initial rejection and arranged for one of admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer’s employees to take classes that were listed on her transcript. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and will stand trial in Boston federal court Oct. 5.

Lines wrapped around Ground Zero Performance Café Tuesday as students stopped by the only voting center on campus to cast their ballots in the California primaries amid classes, work and extracurriculars.
Reminiscent of the enthusiasm evident among the USC community during the 2018 midterm elections, Ground Zero saw an increased number of student voters, leading to wait times of more than three hours. A few blocks away from the voting center, students on Trousdale Parkway ushered passersby to the polls, encouraging them to exercise their right to vote. After voting, some chose to gather in Wallis Annenberg Hall, anxiously awaiting the Super Tuesday results at the watch party event. 
Super Tuesday marked a turning point in the 2020 primaries, as 14 states selected their Democratic nominee, securing nearly a third of delegates available in the election. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept up 10 of the states up for grabs, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who took the remaining four, including California, according to Associated Press projections. 
These developments served as a surprise to some, including Ben Pearce, president of College Democrats.
“I think [Biden] definitely overperformed tonight. He won Minnesota and Oklahoma, two states that Bernie won in 2016,” said Pearce, a junior majoring in public policy, who attended the watch party hosted by the Dornsife Center for the Political Future and the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy. “In Oklahoma, [Biden] was favored to win, but in Minnesota, Bernie Sanders was the heavy favorite. The story of the night is Joe Biden is probably the front-runner.”
Before Super Tuesday elections, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suspended their presidential bids. Both endorsed Biden Monday along with former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. Pearce said he believes these last-minute endorsements are what led to Biden’s wins in the primaries by consolidating the moderate vote that would have been split if Klobuchar and Buttigieg stayed in the race. 
“It consolidates all the moderate vote into one candidate, whereas the progressive vote is still being split into Warren and [Sanders],” Pearce said. “The only thing that could have gone better for Biden is if Mike Bloomberg had dropped out yesterday as well and endorsed him.”
At the time of publication, The New York Times reported Biden leading the count with 72 more delegates than Sanders at 356. Sanders had a delegate count of more than eight times that of Warren who followed at 35 delegates, ranking third. Warren won 22 more delegates than Bloomberg, a candidate who didn’t enter the race until November but swiftly moved up in the polls in the months following. One of the event moderators and CPF fellow David Hill said he believes this provides insight into the power money has in political campaigns. 
“The people around Bloomberg, the political strategists, are smart people,” Hill said. “They’ve run hundreds of campaigns across America that you don’t even know about for congressional races and Senate races … These are skilled political operatives that had access to unbelievable, obscene amounts of money … This is going to have a sobering effect in the future of billionaires deciding to run for office.”
Nick Lopez, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said he was not surprised by Bloomberg’s voter turnout and believes it is a result of the money he has spent on advertisements. Since November, Bloomberg has spent more money on ads than all other candidates combined, including President Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post.
“The campaign system we have is basically advertising,” Lopez said. “People are allowed to invest like billions of dollars to advertise — it’s expected.” 
Although Sanders received lackluster results than what was projected, Pearce said voters should not be discouraged and that it is imperative to keep supporting the candidate as the election cycle continues. 
“It’s too close for us to give up,” Pearce said. “Even if tonight wasn’t a victory that we wanted, the fight is far from over. Especially people who love [Sanders], double down on your efforts to get him elected … Donate if you can, keep supporting [Sanders] because he’s got a shot to win it. Even if it’s not as big as a shot as it was just five hours ago. It’s still a shot, and it’s too soon to give up on it now.”
Joelle Ferguson, a senior majoring in public relations, who had to skip class to vote, said that for future elections USC should have multiple voting centers. 
“I’ve seen students come to the line and then walk away, and that’s a potential voter leaving,” Ferguson said. “And it’s all because of the process and not so much as the person who wants to vote. And I think that’s the main issue … There’s just one voting place for three days. That doesn’t make sense.”
VoteSC co-president Eleonora Viotto said she was unimpressed by the state of the voting services throughout the past couple of days the center was open. L.A. County experienced technical issues at the Ground Zero voting center and other centers around the county because of an overload of voters. 
Though 12 workers were expected to manage the polls, only four showed up, she said. Half of the 40 machines at the center were not set up and technological problems surfaced continuously throughout the three days of voting, slowing down the process. 
Tuesday marked the first time USC opted for a digitized voting center, incorporating computers rather than paper ballots used at traditional polling places, said Viotto, a senior majoring in communication and political science. New to elections this year, the voting center also allowed same-day registration for California residents.

Washington D.C. was founded on a swamp. This murky geography has been used as a metaphor for American politics since the early 1900s, but President Donald Trump revived the tradition in 2016, turning “drain the swamp” into a cornerstone of his campaign. The message was simple: The systems of government are rigged for the ruling class, and it will take a “man of the people” to fix them. 
Given the trajectory of his presidency, it’s easy to forget that Trump ran on a populist platform. He promised to end lobbying and raise taxes on the rich, following in the footsteps of other anti-elitist politicians including Sen. Bernie Sanders.  
While Sanders and Trump are wildly opposite in terms of approach, the two share a similar pathos. Both candidates have leaned into their status as champions of the common man. Where Trump chants “drain the swamp,” Sanders promises a government that “belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.”
They play the same role — the outsider candidate wringing an unwilling establishment for change. They also both faced fierce opposition from their own parties during the 2016 election. A substantial sect of the Republican Party levied the “Never Trump” movement in hopes to prevent Trump from winning the ticket. Likewise, the purportedly neutral Democratic National Convention showed a vested interest in Hilary Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 election.
The trend recurs in the ongoing Democratic Primary, with Democratic Party leaders opposing Sanders on the grounds that he’s unelectable or that he will hurt the party’s chances of claiming more seats in Congress.  
And just days before the Super Tuesday election day, both democratic candidates former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Kloubuchar withdrew their bids and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. The timing is no coincidence: Buttigieg even said that his reason for withdrawing was to prevent Sanders from gaining an “insurmountable” lead.
If the outcome of Trump’s much antagonized campaign is any indication, the efforts to suppress Sanders’ populism will fail. One poll showed that the plurality of Buttigieg supporters would vote for Sanders as a second choice. 
If the efforts fail and Sanders wins the nomination, it will be for the same reason that Trump overcame the “Never Trump” movement and the millions spent by super PACs to undermine his bid. Both candidates target frustrations with a system that floats economic benefits to the top. When pundits brag about a booming economy, it means nothing to the working class Americans who have yet to see a piece of that prosperity. 
The indignation that Trump and Sanders share on their behalf, however, means everything. 
But the comparison breaks down when we look at actual policy. Trump claims to care about “the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed,” yet his policies have played a large part in the screwing. Through tax cuts to corporations, permanent tax increases on the middle-class and a series of tariffs that costs the average American family $831 per year, Trump has solidified his position at the head of the swamp. 
Whether Sanders will make good on his “common man” appeals is to be seen, but his consistency over a 29-year career is nothing if not a signal of good intent. That is, if the Democratic establishment will allow him to try.

As early as the summer orientation for freshmen, occurring months before the school year begins, USC reserves a part of the day to inform the new Trojan families about the safety measures in place for students. 
One of the first things a new student learns about USC security is that there are Contemporary Services Corporation officers, also known as “yellow jackets,” stationed around the public areas of USC-owned housing. Because USC students walk into the University expecting this service and see officers stationed around campus on a daily basis, it is easy to take CSC officers’ presence for granted. Students should instead take a moment from their hectic schedules to pause and reflect on their appreciation for CSC officers. 
USC defines CSC officers as “security ambassadors” who patrol street corners in areas around campus who can offer help for students in need of assistance. CSC officers are unarmed and cannot detain criminals; however, their job is to keep a lookout for crime and notify the Department of Public Safety if something is wrong. CSC officers also help to deter crime — in at least one instance, the presence of an officer actually stopped a student from being robbed on the street.
In 2009, the CSC officers first became a staple of the USC community, and after only a year, DPS reported that the CSC officer program successfully lessened the anxiety of the community about crime.
In an anonymous interview the Daily Trojan conducted with a yellow jacket last spring, the officer said shifts are usually late at night and last up to six-and-a-half hours long. Since CSC does not allow its employees to work more than 30 hours a week, the vast majority of officers need to pick up a second job.  
He explained that once an officer works for a long period of time, the students become like family. He loves being an ambassador of USC because he feels energized by the students. 
Although most students are aware of the existence of the yellow jackets, there should be a more calculated effort to fully acknowledge and appreciate them. Instead of walking by a yellow jacket and staring at your phone or looking off to the distance, say “hello” or “thank you.” 
Appreciation for yellow jackets can be shown in multiple small ways. Gratitude doesn’t have to be expressed as a physical note, it can be as simple as quickly thanking them as you cross the street. 
Three years ago, the service organization ARK Project Now hosted USC Yellow Jackets Appreciation Day in which participating students could write cards, converse or bring candy and tea to yellow jackets to show their appreciation. These kinds of events could be held on a more frequent, consistent basis to allow all students at USC to participate. 
The school administration should also play a role in facilitating thanks to its staff. Instead of just one organization putting together a USC Yellow Jackets Appreciation Day, USC administration could plan and advertise an event like this. With the backing of USC, more people would know about it, which would allow for an even greater campus-wide participation. In fact, the event could even grow as big as a USC Yellow Jackets Appreciation Week. 
CSC officers are an important part of the USC community who make students feel safer and at ease. Students and staff alike should prioritize taking time out of their day to show officers how much they are valued as fundamental members of the Trojan Family.

To combat the general public’s ignorance on nuclear power, YouTube series “Getting Bombed” aims to explain the mystery behind the technology that threatens mankind in the 21st century — all while enjoying a few drinks.
Actor, comedian and filmmaker Chris Reinacher sits down in a makeshift doomsday bunker with different nuclear experts for each 10-minute episode posted weekly on his YouTube channel. As the episode progresses, Reinacher and his guest are joined by a silent man in a hazmat suit named Jeff, who serves alcoholic drinks periodically throughout the episode.
“Getting Bombed,” which premiered Feb. 8,  is jointly produced by the Annenberg Norman Lear Center’s Hollywood, Health & Society program and the digital content studio Ovrture of 44 Blue Productions.
The Norman Lear Center covers multiple social justice topics, such as HIV and climate change, that threaten the public’s well-being. Roberta Cruger, a program specialist for the Climate Change Initiative in the Hollywood, Health, & Society program, said she believes “Getting Bombed” is in line with the goals of the Norman Lear Center.
“If we can have an impact on the viewers to change their minds, change their behavior, to take action, that would be really beneficial,” Cruger said.
David Hale, a producer at 44 Blue Production, said the series hopes to tackle the daunting subject of nuclear proliferation through a humorous, light-hearted lens.
“Being unguarded and unfiltered allows for humor, and it’s a subject that I think needs more raw talk,” Hale said. “And it really begs to be more unguarded and more unfiltered. And that’s where the alcohol comes in.”
Kate Folb, director of Hollywood, Health and Society,  said the idea behind the series came after attending dinner with nuclear experts who, after a few drinks, started discussing nuclear power topics, such as nuclear policies and new designs of nuclear missiles.
“They’re progressively getting drunker as they’re talking,” Folb said. “And I’m just sitting there at dinner watching this. And my colleague and I looked at each other and said, ‘Oh my God, this is so interesting and it’s hilarious’ … This has to be a show.” 
Folb described that the goal of the series is to generate awareness in the general population about the many complications of nuclear power, hopefully leading to an eventual change in public policies.  
“We need to be educated about these things, and we do need to be able to know what’s going on and to share our voice if we feel a certain way about how nuclear weapons are being used or threatened to be used in this country, or even where they’re stored,” Folb said.
Awareness about nuclear power is relevant in today’s society, Folb said. The Doomsday Clock, created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, is a machine which indicates the probability of man-made catastrophe through a countdown on a clock. Currently at 100 seconds to midnight, it is the closest the clock has been to midnight, or doomsday, since the clock’s creation in 1947.
Even though the threat of nuclear war is depressing, Hale said it is a topic that needs to be at the forefront of people’s minds. Having lived through the Cold War, Hale said he believes young people today do not have the same cognizance of the possibility of nuclear war that he had growing up.
 “There’s a generation of people who are going to have to live through a new era of nuclear tensions, and we don’t really know how seriously to take those tensions,” Hale said. “I think it’s kind of interesting for audiences to look back at these earlier stories so that they can start to get a sense of the mindset of what it was for the Cold War.”
The absence of prolonged discussion on foreign policy in the 2020 Democratic debates also affects nuclear policy. The relationship the U.S. has with other countries with nuclear technology, such as Russia and Iran, impact U.S. elections and the safety of American citizens, according to Hale.
“I do think that foreign policy is a huge metric by which to measure up a candidate and the idea that nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy are becoming so much more relevant,” Hale said. “We can frame any conversation against what it means for the 2020 election, but I think this is a very important conversation to frame against it.” 
Reinacher said nuclear power and its potential devastation is not a light topic, and the series does not aim to treat it as such. The host said he hopes the alcohol serves as a helpful way to connect with the audience through humor.
“I like approaching serious things in a funny or cavalier way … because I think it kind of brings down this mysticism, and it brings down the fear of talking about something, and it makes it fun in a way,” Reinacher said. 
Additionally, Reinacher acknowledges that nuclear power can be difficult to understand in its entirety for viewers of the series who are not experts in the nuclear field. Through “Getting Bombed,” Reinacher said he wants to reach the average person, even if they do not know much about the subject of nuclear war.
“I know nothing, you’re with me,” Reinacher said. “Let’s ask a bunch of questions, even if they’re stupid.”

With millions of songs — new and old — available on streaming services and thousands of artists to discover, there is absolutely no reason why anyone should claim the genre of R&B is dead. 
“Music don’t feel the same because we barely have R&B, … R&B brung that balance to music … now everything is leanin one way smh so it gets played out quick! We need R&B for the balance no kap!” These words from rapper Young M.A’s Twitter account pinched a nerve. To give her credit, the last portion of her statement is a sentiment I relate to. R&B does bring a precise balance to more dynamic and intense-sounding genres that populate the charts — think pop, EDM and some rap, specifically trap-leaning songs. 
Despite the truth in her tweet, R&B is very much present in today’s musical landscape. There are a host of artists like Jade Novah, Joyce Wrice, Kyle Dion, Tony Sway, BJ The Chicago Kid, Charity, Snoh Aalegra and more, whose music is reminiscent of the genre’s soulful roots. When people claim the style is dead or has lost its way, artists such as Baby Rose immediately come to mind; her voice sounds like it was plucked from the Motown archives. Or even Ari Lennox’s album-opener “Chicago Boy,” which would fit perfectly into any late-night radio format alongside the classics of Sade or Erykah Badu. 
These two Dreamville-adjacent artists are just the surface of what R&B in 2020 has to offer. Beneath them (in popularity, not talent) are a host of other artists who critique the genre for having too many “whisper singers,” lacking singers who were raised in the church or sampling the classics too often, among a host of other critiques. 
That’s not to say there aren’t issues with R&B today. I was not too fond of Justin Bieber’s faux R&B album “Changes.” There are fifty-’leven British artists who sound very similar to Ella Mai and Mahalia. And last, but certainly not least, C*ris B*own makes the same song over and over again. But in any genre there exists bad, corny or played- out elements, so why does R&B face so much scrutiny? 
The answer: The beloved genre is deeply unreported on in tandem with our affinity for nostalgia and lazy music discovery efforts. To the first point, take a minute to conjure up two or three music outlets or music journalism products such as video series, web shows and Instagram accounts that focus on the genre. You probably can’t. Shout out to COLORS for consistently putting on new talent and a host of other smaller creators who are dedicated to the genre. But when it comes to the Complexes, Geniuses and Jon Caramanicas of the world, the focus of their R&B effort is tethered to major label talent and viral hits. 
To the second point, please let ’90s R&B go. Yes, we love New Edition and covet singers with voices like Deborah Cox, but the era is not coming back. All genres go through tectonic shifts and will continue to evolve and change. Just because today’s artists aren’t fitting for the Love Jones soundtrack doesn’t mean the genre has been utterly disgraced. If ’90s R&B is what you crave, it’s readily available on all streaming platforms and you can head to YouTube to hear whatever Aaliyah is missing.
Lastly, we must be more ambitious about finding music that suits our needs. There’s no question that discovering music can be a daunting task. Where do you start? How do you move past Spotify’s or Tidal’s suggestions and personalized mixes? But just because it’s hard to find R&B you like doesn’t mean it’s not out there. 
I suggest combing through SoundCloud or following accounts like @RnBUntapped on Instagram. Soulection or @JoeKay’s Twitter replies are other great resources for discovering new talent in the genre, as well as COLORS. 
To Young M.A, my SZA whisper haters and more, there are a plethora of R&B artists to discover. To help your search, here is a mini-playlist of R&B tracks to rekindle your love for the genre and restore balance to your music library: 
1. “Paradise” by Daniel Merriweather 
2. “Thing Called Love” by Kevin Ross
3. “We Don’t Funk” by KIRBY 
4. “Damn” by Anthony Flammia 
5. “In Love with You” by Al Bettis 
6. “Hands Off Me” by Chiiild
7. “Sobriety” by Kaash Paige
8. “Not 4 Nothin” by Alia Kadir 
9. “Pan!c” by Audrey Mika
10. “Little Bit” by Erika de Casier 
11. “Bittersweet” by Lianne La Havas

Acclaimed Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz followed a screening of his documentary “Storm Children, Book One” with a Q&A at the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre Monday night. The two-and-a-half-hour long film follows the daily lives of a group of children in Tacloban City months after Typhoon Yolanda, the largest and deadliest typhoon in the Philippines’ history. 
The screening, which was moderated by Alex Ago, director of programing and special projects at the School of Cinematic Arts, was a collaboration between SCA, the American Cinematheque and the East Asian Studies Center. Grace Ryu, the associate director of the East Asian Studies Center, was familiar with Diaz’s work through streaming his other films and thought the screening was the perfect opportunity to expand the center’s programming.
“We have focused primarily on East Asia, which is China, Japan, Korea,” Ryu said. “But we do hope to expand to Southeast Asia and South Asia so this was a wonderful opportunity to bring a Southeast Asian filmmaker here to campus.”
Diaz did not arrive in the Philippines with the intention of focusing his project on children, but the protagonists of his story became evident when he saw young people frequently ignored by  post-disaster mainstream media coverage. 
“The first time that I went there, I noticed the kids,” Diaz said. “It’s really chaotic and at the same time it’s real, when that storm happened … So many people came, even Anderson Cooper was there, so it’s the whole world that’s coming. I was behind the scenes shooting them, and then I noticed the kids.”
The majority of the footage showed children sifting through rubble in hopes of finding something of value or children playing in the flooded streets. This caught Diaz’s attention, as the children had returned to their normal activities while the adults were still immobilized by shock and grief. 
“They just forgot about the storm, just forgot about the devastation,” Diaz said. “I was struck by their innocence and their beauty, so I started focusing on them.” 
Diaz told the crowd about how he met the children at the focal point of the project and how he gained their permission to film them.
“I just stayed there. I lived there for a month, and then they became my friends, they didn’t mind it at all. I said, ‘I’m going to shoot you guys and follow your lives.’”
It is the juxtaposition of the horrific tragedy the community is struggling to heal from and the way the children maintain their playful attitudes that makes this an acclaimed documentary. In one shot, a group of young girls sings Frozen’s “Let It Go” as the camera focuses on a broken road filled with remnants of destroyed homes. The disaster zone is turned into a waterpark as children use broken roofs to raft down flooded streets and turn abandoned ships into diving boards.
Diaz is a stylistic filmmaker, known for his frequent use of black and white and his pioneering role in the slow cinema movement, with many of his films having a run time of around nine hours. While the runtime of this documentary is only a fraction of his typical work, he utilizes the same long, drawn-out shots he is famous for. 
“We start very observational, but then as things progress, we start to actually see a little bit more of the filmmaker, because they’re speaking to [Diaz] directly,” Ago said. 
The documentary subverts many expectations American audiences hold when walking into a theater. There is little dialogue and no underscoring; the film structure is simply a procession of tableaux, where the camera is at a fixed angle and rarely moves. One of the most touching moments is when two boys unearth a small ball from a pile of wreckage which audiences watch them dig through for a half hour. 
“There’s this endlessly fascinating sequence in the film where the boys are unearthing things that clearly had been buried after the ravages of the storm,” Ago said. “And, quite frankly, it was almost hypnotic, just sort of following what they were doing there, especially when they actually start extracting things.” 
Despite the lack of narrative elements viewers expect, the documentary’s emotional resonance comes through the ceaseless daily activities that suck the audience in. Diaz said he had no expectation or narrative in mind when he arrived in Tacloban but rather allowed the real lives of the people recovering to tell the story. 
“That’s the beauty of organic methodology where you don’t know anything, you’re just discovering things every day, you’re discovering things as you go along,” Diaz said. “It’s a very fluid thing.”

Every several years, the International Olympic Committee gathers to determine where the next Olympic Games should be held. Because preparation for the Olympics takes years, the IOC chose 2020’s Tokyo all the way back in 2011. 
Tokyo was chosen for many reasons. The city has been a hub for international trade, culture and technology for decades, and it also boasts a metropolitan population of 36 million people, which gives the Games maximum exposure. 
However, there are growing fears that the 2020 Olympics in Japan might not even happen at all. In light of the dire condition brought upon many countries by the coronavirus, the Olympics is now in jeopardy. More than 1,000 people in Japan have been infected with the virus, 12 have died and several schools have been shut down. 
The prospect alone of a cancelled Olympics shows just how inextricably linked sports are with politics. Months ago, the coronavirus was a story best suited for the front page of The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It was a story that highlighted communist suppression and the global threat of pandemics. 
Now, it’s on our sports pages. 
The spread of the virus also highlights the potential reach of political decisions in a globalized world. According to The New York Times, when officials in China first learned of the coronavirus, their reaction was to suppress the discovery rather than report it. At the time, this was a political calculation, a consideration made with the interests of the Communist party in mind. Now, that political calculation has not only led to a miserable situation for the Party but a potential catastrophe for the wider world of sports.
Other prominent examples exist to further highlight the connection between sports and politics. After 9/11, MLB postponed several of its games, pushing the World Series well into November. The NFL did the same, cancelling the weekend’s games after the attack.
In the same vein, the Olympics, arguably the biggest international sporting event in the world, is under threat. Talk of a potential cancellation is in full swing, and representatives of the IOC have already publicly discussed the potential of delaying the Games or moving them to a different city, which is virtually unfeasible. 
If I was in charge of determining where to move the Olympics, I would say move the Games to a location that has already hosted it in recent years such as Rio de Janeiro or London. Most likely, many of the Olympic venues are now being used recreationally and can be quickly turned around to accommodate the Olympics again.
This is a better option than postponing the Olympics because of the challenges with timing that would arise otherwise. If postponed, many of the athletes and participants would have to wait longer, causing their entire training schedules to be thrown off and, for older athletes, possibly impacting their chances of participating in the Games at all. In addition, the Olympics has a tradition of hosting the Winter Games two years after the Summer Games, so a postponement would throw off the IOC’s time tables.
The IOC would be doing athletes and sports fans all over the world a disservice by canceling the Olympics. Though the risk is real and must be approached with the utmost care, the Olympics is a historic tradition that should not be canceled altogether even if there is a fear of a health epidemic. The IOC definitely does not want to cancel the Olympics, and an overwhelming majority of people don’t want that either. 
There are many different ways to approach the situation, and there’s not one easy answer. But whatever the IOC decides to do, it must not simply call off the 2020 Games.

Only three players on the USC women’s basketball team earn a “C” on their jersey. This honor is  usually reserved for a fourth-year senior or a longtime USC veteran, but for senior forward Kayla Overbeck, all it took was one year as a Trojan to earn that coveted letter.
Long before Overbeck became captain of the USC basketball team, though, she tried out every sport she could as a kid: soccer, softball, track, basketball, volleyball and gymnastics. But with two former college basketball players for parents, Overbeck was primed for a future in hoops.
“Given my experience with the sport, I tried to get her in as many competitive leagues [as possible] and some boys’ leagues and just worked with her as much as I could,” Kayla’s mother, Shanon, said. “[We] just provided avenues for her to play club and [on] some of the top AAU teams in Southern California just to get her what she needed to get her to the next level.”
Although Overbeck also played volleyball through her four years of high school, she realized after her freshman year that she might be capable of competing in basketball at the next level. She began training with her high school coaches, who recommended she join a top-tier team to help her pursue a college career.
Overbeck entered Vanderbilt in 2016 as a three-star recruit ranked No. 19 in the country at her position according to ESPN. However, she did not stay under the radar for long, earning SEC All-Freshman Team honors, leading the conference’s freshmen with 7.2 rebounds per game and averaging a solid 9.5 points per game.
After her breakout freshman performance, Overbeck was invited to try out for the United States’ U19 National Team. She was surprised to receive the invitation but attended the tryout after receiving encouragement from her coaches at Vanderbilt.
“I didn’t even really know anything about [the] USA [team],” Overbeck said. “Growing up [and] in high school, it wasn’t really a thing. I wasn’t on the AAU circuit as early as other players.”
But Overbeck made the national team, and her team went on to win silver at the FIBA U19 World Cup that summer. She credits the atmosphere on the international stage for making her time with Team USA one of the most challenging yet valuable learning experiences she could have had as a freshman.
“I really thought it helped me grow more as a leader and [in] really trying to get to know people that I’m not really comfortable with,” Overbeck said. “We [were] on a completely new team for a month, and [it taught] me how you can talk to different players in different ways and try to bring the most out of each other in any type of setting.”
After two seasons with Vanderbilt, Overbeck decided to transfer to USC. The Newbury Park native said being closer to home was a big incentive for her to choose the Trojans. She now has at least one family member in attendance at each home game, and her parents have made road trips to watch her play in Northern California and Arizona.
“Having them [in L.A.] is so much better than having them come for a weekend for the whole year,” Overbeck said. “[At Vanderbilt], it was just months of not being with my family, and that I just didn’t really like. It wasn’t the best for me as a person or as a player.”
When she came to USC, Overbeck brought a fresh perspective from her time with Team USA about how to be a leader on and off the court. This season, she was tasked with creating chemistry among a team with only three returners: herself, sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell and redshirt sophomore guard Shalexxus Aaron, who has not competed this season due to a foot injury.
Caldwell, who has played with Overbeck during her two seasons at USC and is also a team captain, said Overbeck’s leadership made welcoming new faces — including seven freshmen and two transfers — much easier. The pair had to step up to guide the newcomers after co-captain and graduate transfer guard Stephanie Watts missed most of the season with a knee injury.
“Creating cohesion with Kayla has always been very easy,” Caldwell said. “She’s all about team, and she’s all about loving her teammates. So just having that natural chemistry with her has just been really easy since I first started playing with her.” 
Overbeck said her goal has been to create a dynamic that her teammates really want to be a part of as they navigate the balance between their academic, social and athletic demands.
“I just try to make it a type of atmosphere that you want to be in, you want to start, you want to be there,” she said.
According to Shanon, Kayla has always set an example for her teammates. Shanon remembers that Kayla wasn’t discouraged after fouling out of a highly contested high school playoff game her senior year.
“Instead of going to the bench and feeling sorry for herself, she was the loudest cheerer on the bench,” Shanon said. “I think given Kayla’s support, you know, their top player on the bench supporting them, it just fueled them to get the win.”
While Overbeck has been a vocal leader throughout her basketball career, her play also speaks for itself. She was named a Pac-12 All-Defensive Honorable Mention on Tuesday after a senior season during which she averaged 7.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.1 assists. 
USC head coach Mark Trakh said Overbeck’s focus both on and off the court has helped her develop into one of the Pac-12’s best defenders.
“Kayla’s intense,” Trakh said. “I think she’s one of the best defensive players in the conference … super kid, great student [and] really has done a great job for us.”
Although Overbeck is a fierce, focused threat on the court, her family and teammates also suggest there is a humorous, softer side of her that fans don’t always get to see.
For example, Caldwell said the team never knows what to expect out of Overbeck when she gets an and-1.
“Sometimes it can be a dance move, sometimes she can just yell, acting like she’s yelling to somebody but just yelling out loud,” Caldwell said.
It’s these three sides to Overbeck — the team leader, the intense and talented defender and the boisterous teammate — that will make her so missed by her teammates after she graduates this spring.
“I will miss the craziness the most,” Caldwell said. “Kayla is the most interesting teammate I have ever had, and she will always hold that title, but the passion that she plays with is just unmatched.”
