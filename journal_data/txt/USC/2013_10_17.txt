On Thursday at 10:17 a.m. students and faculty across campus took a moment during classes to drop, cover and hold.
In an effort to raise awareness of earthquake preparedness, USC participated in the largest earthquake drill in U.S. history, the Great California ShakeOut. The statewide earthquake readiness campaign is organized by the Earthquake Country Alliance led by the Southern California Earthquake Center, which is headquartered at USC.
“Everyone, everywhere should know how to protect themselves in an earthquake,” said Lance Webster, a media consultant for ShakeOut. “It’s important for students to know the moment you feel shaking you should drop to the ground.”
Event organizers posted fliers around campus and sent emails out to students, staff and faculty at USC to encourage everyone to take a moment to drop, cover and hold. Additionally 200 staff and faculty members volunteered as USC ShakeOut Ambassadors, who assisted in facilitating the event and reminding classrooms to participate in the drill.
Students such as Anne Stachofsky, an undeclared sophomore, are thankful for the opportunity the event provides to practice earthquake safety.
“Living in California, earthquakes are definitely something we should be prepared for especially since they are so rare that unless you are practiced in what to do, you might not have any previous experience,” Stachofsky said.
The Southern California area is supposedly 150 years overdue for a major earthquake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This major earthquake is projected to be in the 7.8 range on the Richter scale. That is 25 times the power of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake that killed nearly 100 people and caused more than $20 billion in damage.
“People here at the Southern California Earthquake Center have a responsibility to let Southern California know about this danger, so we created the Great Southern California ShakeOut six years ago in order to do that,” Webster said.
In the first year of the event, there were more than 5 million participants. Since then, popularity of the event has nearly doubled. This year, 9.6 million people in California registered to participate, breaking last year’s record.
In the event that a major earthquake does take place, the USC Dept. of Public Safety has specific plans in place to protect students and faculty. According to USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning Specialist Steve Goldfarb, each building on campus has a trained team of staff to tend to immediate needs for that building after an earthquake.
“These teams of individuals are trained to deal with emergency response measures and evacuation,” Goldfarb said. “We also have a team of 300 individuals who compose the Campus Emergency Response Team trained in search and rescue, triage and first aid.”
Many students are unaware of the appropriate measures to take during an earthquake, and Thursday’s drill aimed to educate those students, Goldfarb said. Josh Byun, an undecided sophomore, said he was one of these students.
“I don’t think I would feel super prepared if an earthquake happened,” Byun said. “I just know you are supposed to get under something sturdy, but that is about it.”
According to Webster, an important part of the event is to educate students who come from states or countries where earthquakes are not common.
“Students may be from somewhere else other than Southern California, but if there is an earthquake while they are here they need to know what to do,” he said. “No one would be immune if a major earthquake happens in our state.”
Students who participated in the drill in class had mixed opinions.
“I slept through it, but our earthquakes professor made us do the drop, cover and hold drill in class [earlier], and it was actually really helpful,” said Lily Mo, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Sometimes we forget to look towards the ceiling when we’re scoping out possible threats and forget things like chandeliers or projectors that could actually really hurt us.”
Camille Bradshaw, an undeclared sophomore from Oregon, said she appreciated the drill because she has never experienced an earthquake.
“I think it’s really important that we practice what to do in an earthquake especially for students like me who are not from here,” Bradshaw said. “It’s definitely a good thing that they are trying to make students more aware of the protocol of what to do in an emergency.”
Students, staff and faculty can find additional resources for earthquake preparedness on the Campus Safety and Emergency Preparedness and ShakeOut websites.

For Trojans on campus who aren’t in range of Starbucks or Coffee Bean between classes, the new Illy “Pop-Up Cafes,” which will be around campus during the month of October, provide the opportunity to stay caffeinated.
These “Pop-Up Cafes,” named for their perpetually moving location, are a new project for Illy, a coffee company that prides itself on its espresso. As of now, USC is the first and only college campus to have incorporated pop-up cafes into its dining options.
The idea for these cafes at USC arose in response to various deans and vice deans requesting that coffee be made more readily available to the students at their respective schools. Because there are many areas on campus where USC Hospitality is not allowed to build, pop-up cafes are a solution to the unequal distribution of cafes on campus.
“When [Hospitality] met with the folks at Illy a while ago, they mentioned they had a pop-up solution that might work for us,” said Kris Klinger, director of hospitality. “This gives us the opportunity to provide services in areas where we normally would not be able to provide services.”
Though the pop-up cafes have only just begun to appear on campus, Klinger said that the student reaction to them has been positive so far. Currently, Illy Pop-Up Cafes are located every week in the Lyon Center and in the courtyard of the School of Social Work.
“When we were testing and doing some of the training, people that walked by were blown away,” Klinger said. “It’s unique and the [Illy] product is great.”
Jonathan Hernandez, a Hospitality employee who worked at the Illy Pop-Up Cafe when it was at the Lyon Center, said he has received a warm welcome so far from the Trojan community, especially international students.
“A lot of people know Illy … The international students will recognize it quickly and say, ‘Oh my god, Illy,” Hernandez said.
Some students, however, were not impressed with the quality of the product served or the prices being charged. Jon Kaye, an sophomore majoring in music industry, came across one of the cafes on the north part of campus and bought a cappuccino, but said he wasn’t pleased by the flavor or the size of the serving.
“It was convenient and it was worth a shot,” Kaye said. “I had never [before] tried their brand of coffee, but I don’t plan on trying it again.”
Other students, such as Michael Vayntrub, said that the current locations of the pop-up cafes are not convenient or even noticeable to the average student.
“I walk past the School of Social Work every day, and I only just noticed [the cafe],” said Vayntrub, a senior majoring in psychology. “I don’t think these will be successful because of where they’re placed on campus [and] there’s only one person manning it, which is a real inconvenience to students.”
Vayntrub also pointed out that the School of Social Work is not far from the Starbucks located in Birnkrant Residential Hall.
Other students, however, were pleasantly surprised when they saw one of the cafes.
“[The cafe] was tucked away and there was only one person in line, which I liked in comparison to the out-of-the-door lines of TroGro and Coffee Bean,” said Kaitlin McGillivray, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
Hospitality said it would like to maintain the pop-up cafes as long as possible if students and faculty respond well to them during the next few months.
The locations of the cafes are advertised on Hospitality’s Twitter and Facebook pages. In the near future, Hospitality also plans to release a list of upcoming locations on its website.

On Thursday, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Media, Economics and Entrepreneurship (M{2E}) program hosted David C. McCourt as part of its “Strategy Session” series.
“These sessions are typically designed to have an outside senior leader from an outside agency come in and talk about a particular problem in a particular industry area,” said Chris Smith, co-director of M{2E}.
McCourt’s list of achievements includes winning an Emmy for Reading Rainbow and receiving an award from the White House for his accomplishments in the private sector. Previously, he has served as the Resident Economist at Annenberg.
In this discussion, McCourt talked about what he learned during his career in telecommunications, working on everything from the development of the first economically viable cable company to a partnership with the Irish government.
To begin the session, McCourt discussed the many disadvantages facing young entrepreneurs of this generation.
“When I was doing a research program, you had to get a book. It allowed you to connect the dots and go about pattern recognition,” McCourt said. “You can Google something and the machine does it for you. When you had to do that the old way you developed a pattern recognition yourself.”
McCourt, however, praised USC for the work it does with entrepreneurship.
“This media, economics and entrepreneurship [program] solves that, and you’re the only university that’s doing that,” McCourt said.
McCourt recently set up a partnership with the Irish government to create e|net, which they hope will be a model for providing Internet access to rural communities in the Middle East and Africa.
When asked why he selected Ireland for this startup, McCourt cited two major reasons.
“Number one, Ireland is a small enough country that we can test things. It’s 12 percent of the population of Southern California, so we can do something and see the results,” McCourt said. “Number two, this company has to be based somewhere and we don’t want it to be an American-centered company.”
McCourt hopes that through e|net, he will bring engineers from satellite, fiber optics and cellular backgrounds to tackle the issue of affordable access to the Internet, which McCourt sees as an ethical duty as Internet provides everything from media to healthcare.
“There’s three billion people who are screwed from getting ahead,” McCourt said. “We want to find a way to connect those people.”
Despite the current resentment towards American communications companies because of strict government regulations, McCourt argued that regulatory bodies have little effect on business.
“My general view on regulatory bodies is that they will almost never put a startup business, but they’ll almost never take a startup out of business,” McCourt said. “I think you almost have to ignore these regulatory bodies and do what’s right.”
Throughout the discussion, McCourt emphasized three things about his ideas on business. He said he valued an adherence to ethics, innovative thought and willingness to fail.
Many students said the topic that resonated with them the most was McCourt’s emphasis on “quality failure.” McCourt believes that the only way to be an entrepreneur is to embrace failure and then find a way to remedy it. He considers the fear of failure to be a great disadvantage inn.
Denise Guerra, a second-year graduate student studying journalism, supported this idea.
“My favorite part was his speech on failure and failing better and the idea that it’s continuing experimentation,” she said.
Miles Winston, a senior majoring in public relations, echoed this opinion.
“[Failing harder] resonates with me as I’m thinking about what to do next,” Winston said.
McCourt closed the discussion with an emphasis on collaboration.
“[Partnership]’s been good for all aspects of my life,” McCourt said, citing everything from his businesses to his marriage.
Editor’s note: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated said McCourt had been married more than once.

Compton Mayor Aja Brown returned to her alma mater Thursday to discuss her path to public service and her plans to revitalize the city. Brown spoke in the Widney Alumni House to approximately 20 students through an event sponsored by the Judith and John Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise.
Leading on · USC alumnus Aja Brown, City of Compton’s youngest mayor, discussed how USC affected her path to public service on Thursday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Brown became the City of Compton’s youngest mayor in June when she was elected to her position. She ran against 11 candidates, and received approximately 64 percent of the vote in the run-off election.
Though she had never run for public office before, Brown believed she could bring necessary improvements to the city.
“People are ready for change,” Brown said. “I just really want to reach them and touch them because in Compton we’ve had leaders that haven’t really been in our community.”
Brown was born in Pasadena, Calif. after her mother moved away from Compton because of a personal tragedy. Brown, who has a twin, said when she was growing up she was involved in many academic programs that piqued her interest in the public service.
She said her experience at the university has been applicable in every aspect of her career.
“USC is such an awesome institution because everything I’ve learned I have applied in the last 10 years of my career,” Brown said. “Going into college, I knew I didn’t just want to make a lot of money, I really wanted to be a place-changer.”
Students participating in the discussion with her freely asked questions and later said her outlook inspired them.
“It was incredibly inspirational. I think she has a clear vision for what she wants to see in Compton,” said Justin Tandingan, a second-year graduate student studying policy and development. “She shows that you can really put into action what you learn at Price [School of Public Policy].”
Brown graduated from the university with a bachelor’s degree in 2004 and a master’s degree in 2005 from the Price School. After graduation, she worked in policy planning, and she and her husband moved to Compton in 2009.
Compton has approximately 100,000 residents. Though the city has historically been predominantly black, black people now comprise only 40 percent of the population. Hispanic residents comprise about 60 percent of the city.
Brown said the shifting demographics between blacks and Hispanics has not caused any tension.
“Compton is a very close-knit community,” Brown said. “There is no racial tension as people would think. We all live in the same city and consider the same things. I’m really focusing on our similarities.”
Brown is also seeking to improve many of the broken structures within the city. Though looking to promote the similarities, Brown also wants to touch upon the wide diversity of students when moving forward with the reforms.
“We are characterizing our unique characteristics and using it as our strength,” she said in reference to her plans to require all students to learn English, Spanish and sign language.
Brown said economic issues are also important to cities’ success. She noted that in the past decade, Compton has had significant financial struggles. In the last six years the city amassed a 40 percent deficit. Under Brown’s leadership, the city recently passed a balanced budget.
“Change really happens one family at a time, one street at a time, one person at a time,” Brown said. “I want to inspire change in individuals so that they will go out and change their communities as well.”
Brown said one of her biggest surprises during her time as mayor has been the outside interest in the dealings of the city.
“Compton has been off of the radar for a very long time,” she said. “My surprise has been the level of support that we receive from outside of the community.”
Brown ended her discussion by encouraging students to pave new paths in within their careers, similar to her experience in public policy.
“Pick those places that people don’t want to go,” Brown said. “Because that is where change can be made.”
Brown’s optimism resonated with students interested in the public policy field as well.
“It was a really beneficial experience to hear from someone who is making such an important impact to the community,” said Melinda Grodsky, a second-year graduate student studying public administration.

Though the USC women’s volleyball team has won 10 matches in a row and is now 6-0 to start Pac-12 play, they know as well as anyone that the hard work is just beginning.
Veteran · Senior outside hitter Sara Shaw has averaged 2.14 kills per set this season, her third as a full-time starter for the Women of Troy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
After sweeping both Oregon State and Oregon on the road last weekend, the Women of Troy will hit the road again this weekend to take on the No. 22 Arizona State Sun Devils and the unranked Arizona Wildcats.
The Women of Troy, currently ranked No. 1 overall by the Coaches Association, are off to their best start in seven years in conference play — their six consecutive wins matches USC’s start of Pac-10 play in 2006.
That year, the Women of Troy reached the NCAA Regional Semifinals, otherwise known as the Sweet 16. This team might have even more potential than the 2006 squad.
With a core of veteran leadership made up of seniors Natalie Hagglund, Alexis Olgard and Sara Shaw, among others, the team has quickly meshed to become one of the top squads in the nation. After one hiccup in nonconference play — a loss to USD on Sept. 13 —the Women of Troy have gone on a scorching run.
“In preseason, we were still trying to find our connections and our rhythm,” Shaw said of her team’s progression. “We have new players playing, and it’s a time to get connected. I think conference is more about execution and making those plays and finding everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.”
In order to sustain their undefeated conference mark, the Women of Troy will have to go into Tempe and Tucson this weekend and play in two tough road matches. USC head coach Mick Haley — who won his 1,200th career match as a collegiate head coach on Sunday — acknowledged the difficulty of playing on the road in Arizona.
“This [road trip against Arizona and Arizona State] is even harder,” Haley said, comparing the challenge this weekend to last weekend’s trip up to Oregon.
Haley also recognizes the difficulty of going up against Arizona State, a team that took USC to the wire at the Galen Center last year before handily defeating the Women of Troy in Tempe later in the season.
“They just matched up well against us,” Haley said of Arizona State’s 2012 lineup. “We couldn’t seem to handle the situation; we didn’t play well but they played very well. In this conference, that happens.”
Of course, last season the Sun Devils didn’t have to match up against USC freshmen sensations Ebony Nwanebu and Elise Ruddins, both outside hitters who have taken home Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors this season.
The Sun Devils opened the season with seven straight sweeps against non-conference opponents but have since slipped, falling to a 13-5 overall record with a 2-4 record in conference play. They do, however, hold home-court advantage quite well, losing only one match out of six in Tempe this season. The Women of Troy will hope to hand them home loss number two to avenge last season’s defeat.
“Last year I remember [Arizona State] was out to get us,” Shaw said. “I think we can expect that for this year too.”
Sunday’s opponent, the Arizona Wildcats, are unranked, yet have the exact same overall record as their in-state rivals. The Wildcats, however, have a better conference record at 3-3 and have only lost one match out of 11 at home. USC will look to their efficient offense to make quick work of Arizona.
The Women of Troy feature an offense that aims to go on the attack. By bringing in an extra setter, the offense has more options when it gets the ball. Not surprisingly, freshman phenom Nwanebu — who led the team with 11 kills against the Ducks last week — is supportive of the offensive style.
“We have so many weapons,” Nwanebu said of her team’s offensive prowess. “It’s not the setter just giving the ball to one person or two, they can give it to three different people or even the back row. The opponent never knows where the ball’s going to go.”
Another factor that might affect the Women of Troy this weekend is their national ranking. Currently, USC is ranked No. 1 in the nation and, though it’s a great honor for the team, it can also be a burden at times.
“For the past few weeks whoever has been ranked number one has lost,” Shaw noted. “So I’m kind of excited we won last weekend and didn’t get jinxed like everybody else. But we try not to think about the rankings and try just to think about our play.”
Haley said he doesn’t put too much stock into the rankings at this point in the season, either.
“There are a lot of different things happening in the rankings,” Haley said. “But the reason we shy away from them a little bit is that it just puts a bulls-eye on you. That’s why they have the rankings, to create more interest in the matches during the season. So when you get that bulls-eye on your back, everyone wants to be the team to knock you off. That’s why nobody stays number one for very long.”
Regarding the rankings, Nwanebu summed up her team’s sentiments in one simple idea: play with the end in mind.
“You could lose and go from No. 1 to No. 21,” Nwanebu said. “It all depends on what you’re ranked at the end of the season.”
The Women of Troy open this weekend’s action on Friday at 8 p.m. in Tempe and will travel to Tucson for a 2:30 p.m. game on Sunday. Both games will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

The No. 1-ranked USC Women’s swim and dive team is splitting up this weekend to begin its 2013-14 campaign — several select members will travel to Dallas, Tex. to swim in the SMU Classic while the rest of the Women of Troy will head to Pullman, Wash. to compete against Washington State.
Only eight swimmers and one diver are allowed to compete in the SMU Classic, which takes place this Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m. CT. Those few hand-picked members will swim against North Carolina, Indiana, Louisville, Miami and host SMU. USC will be sending eight All-Americans to the meet, with the ninth member being freshman and U.S. national team member Chelsea Chenault.
The rest of the team will compete in its first conference meet of the season at Washington State.
Even though USC will be forced to split up this weekend, the team is confident that they can come out victorious in both competitions.
“We have full confidence in each other that we can get the work done and come home with a win for USC,” senior All-American Meghan Hawthorne said.
Last year, the Women of Troy won the SMU Classic by 73.5 points over second-place North Carolina while also beating San Diego during the same weekend by 32 points. USC  beat Washington State later in the season by a score of 137-58. The team finished its 2012-13 campaign by finishing second in the Pac-12 meet and placing 7th in the national meet.
“Our biggest competitions are still to come,” senior captain Kasey Carlson said. “But the ability to swim fast in October both at the SMU invite and versus Washington State will carry through the rest of the season.”
Though the girls will have to rely on underclassmen to step up and compete after graduating six swimmers who scored points in the national meet last year, they also have a lot of leadership and strong talent returning with All-American seniors Hawthorne, Carlson and Stina Gardell. Other returning USC All-American swimmers include senior Lynette Lim, redshirt junior Andrea Kropp and and sophomores Kendyl Stewart, Jasmine Tosky and Kasia Wilk. All except Lim will be competing in the SMU Classic, as will redshirt junior All-American diver Haley Ishimatsu.
“The SMU Invite will provide a tough challenge for this team, as well as a great opportunity to race early in the season,” Carlson said. “The No. 1 ranking does put a large target on our backs, but we are ready to keep that top spot and fight for a trophy at the NCAA [meet] in March.”

This week, the Trojans are back where they started this season — as the number one team in the land. USC and UCLA exchanged spots in the latest NCAA rankings after the Trojans took down the Bruins 12-11 in overtime this past weekend.
“The match was very similar to the environment of last year’s national championship game and in some ways, it was even more exciting with Kostas tying the game at the end of regulation,” head coach Jovan Vavic said.
With the win, USC (17-1) brought home its second consecutive SoCal Tournament title and will attempt to take that momentum into this Saturday as the squad prepares for a pair of home matches against nonconference opponents Loyola Marymount and Cal Lutheran at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
With his goal in the semifinal match last weekend against then-No. 3 Pacific, senior Nikola Vavic surpassed Juraj Zatovic  to become USC’s all-time leading scorer.
“I’m very proud since of all of our players, I’ve been toughest on him,” Vavic said of his son. “That was a very tough record to break, and he’s been an all-around great player for our program.”
The team is currently 1-0 in conference play after defeating No. 9 UC Irvine at home, 18-7, on Oct. 5. This weekend’s doubleheader will be a break in MPSF competition.
Loyola Marymount (10-9) is ranked No. 13 in this week’s NCAA poll, while Cal Lutheran (8-11) is unranked.
The Trojans defeated LMU, 21-7, earlier in the year at the UC San Diego Triton Invitational. The Lions are coming off a 1-3 weekend at the SoCal tournament with a win against Santa Clara, 11-10, and losses to St. Francis Brooklyn, 12-7, and UC San Diego, 9-7. They are led by Milutin Mitrovic, who has 46 goals and 28 assists.
USC has never lost to LMU and is a perfect 21-0 against them all-time. USC (17-1)  carries a 41-game home winning streak into this weekend’s action.
It will be a long day for Cal Lutheran, who will play a conference match at Chapman University at 11 a.m. before traveling north to take on the Trojans. The Kingsmen are coming off a 10-7 loss to Pomona-Pitzer. USC defeated Cal Lutheran, 21-9, in their only ever meeting last year.
The Trojans will play the Lions at 1 p.m. before jumping right back in the pool to take on the Kingsmen at 3 p.m.

Many of us who have seen USC football in recent years, and many of us who were groaning our displeasure during the Washington State game earlier this semester, have an idea of what USC’s offense “ought” to be. For the past three seasons, to watch USC’s offense was a ritual of the quarterback dropping back into the pocket. As soon as the ball would fire from Matt Barkley’s hand — it began.
The crowd’s gaze rose with the ball and willed its trajectory. When the ball fell, the referees would throw their hands up. We would throw our hands up, high-five some random people. We would repeat this process three or four times. High-five more random people. Toss a girl up in the air 35 times. Spill some popcorn. It’s Hollywood.
USC’s offense this season has been a little bit more sobering, and quite a bit easier to forget. But the offense is reshaping its identity this season, running the ball more in a way that might be puzzling to a casual football fan.
It’s those dubious play calls that started the “Fire Kiffin” chants, and a lack of understanding of how the game works (on both sides, really) that eventually did him in. Those who understand USC football’s storied history, however, might find a silver lining in this offense of running back by committee — a return to the old “Tailback U” days under Coach John McKay and its brief resurgence under Pete Carroll.
Right now, the Trojans’ run-heavy offense is by necessity. For all the complaints of redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler’s inability to be Matt Barkley, the Trojan faithful should be looking towards a far more obvious reason for the switch: running the ball eats up the clock. It means less snaps and a shorter game. As it stands, the Trojans do not have the depth to engage in a war of attrition with opposing teams.
It’s easy to blame this on the sanctions, and sure, interim head coach Ed Orgeron’s decision to bring desserts back to the table probably isn’t thrilling any strength and conditioning coaches, but the Trojans simply cannot last. They are being bled out in longer games and risked giving up the game against a pretty mediocre Arizona team last week.
But there’s an upside to all of this: The Trojans have one of the most talented running back corps in the nation — and also one of the youngest. Behind senior running back Silas Redd and redshirt junior running back D.J. Morgan, the level of talent is staggering.
Each snap for Rivals.com five-star recruit and freshman running back Justin Davis, each carry for redshirt sophomore running backs Tre Madden and Javorius Allen, is one more step towards mastering the speed of the college game. This is compounded by the fact that one of the Trojans’ most physically gifted offensive weapons, Rivals.com five-star freshman running back Ty Isaac, seems to be lying in wait for an opportunity to prove himself.
The point is, while there will be plenty of questions for the Trojans at quarterback and wide receiver for the foreseeable future, they will be stacked at running back for a couple years to come.
We all know how much I love Justin Davis (and in case you don’t, I really love Justin Davis), but the wide-eyed freshman was turning everyone’s head this spring.
According to 6-foot-3, 295-pound freshman defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow, Davis is the strongest guy on the team. Davis’ reputation around the team is one of being a gym rat, the kind of guy whose biceps make a certain Daily Trojan sports columnist want to hit up the Lyon Center and start drinking his Muscle Milk.
But it’s this combination of work ethic, bull-like strength, and complete lack of regard for oncoming defenders that could shape Davis into the one: the next to carry the torch in a lineage of Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen, Charles White, and yes, R—-e B–h. Yes, it’s a bit of a stretch. But it’s not impossible, and it’s definitely a more reasonable expectation than Cody Kessler evolving into the second coming of Matt Barkley.
Will the Trojans contend for a spot in the four-team playoff next season? There’s a chance they might, depending on how this coaching situation pans out.
Should they keep running the ball, though? Well, yes. Coach O, we’re not in Hollywood anymore. The days of expecting Marqise Lee to come down with a miraculous catch seem like all but a memory. After this season, it will be. This is a program, and a fanbase, that needs to start looking on the field, where the work is done — and not up at the stars.
 
“Euno, It’s Saturday…” runs every other Friday. To comment on this story, email Euno at eunol@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
 
I get your point, but you seem to be a bit trashing on Cody Kessler who is improving game by game.

The USC women’s soccer team will look to build off of its impressive road upset of then-No. 5 Stanford last weekend with another Pac-12 matchup against Arizona Friday afternoon. The 3 p.m. home clash was originally scheduled for McAlister Field, but was moved to the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Wednesday.
Out of nowhere · Junior midfielder Alex Quincey hadn’t scored this season before netting two goals last weekend versus Stanford and Cal. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Regardless of the stage, the squad is focused on claiming its second Pac-12 win and maintaining the momentum from its successful Bay Area trip. USC (6-6-2, 1-3-1) claimed a hard-fought 1-1 draw with then-No. 8 California before a stunning victory over Stanford, the first two positive results from its conference slate after dropping three in a row to start Pac-12 play.
USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin felt good about last weekend’s results, and is confident in his team going forward.
“It’s always nice to go up to Cal and Stanford and come away with points,” Khosroshahin said. “It was something that we haven’t done in a while, so it was really an affirmation of our hard work.”
Even with a 6-5-3 record and only one conference win in five tries, the Wildcats should offer the Women of Troy a true test. Arizona is coming off a 2-0 win over Oregon State and 1-0 loss to Oregon, but previously played the Pac-12’s best teams extremely tough.
The team took three consecutive 2-1 losses to No. 2 UCLA, Cal and Stanford, with the Stanford loss coming in double overtime.
Senior forward Jazmin Ponce is a prolific scorer, tied for fourth in the Pac-12 with eight goals. Ponce should challenge USC’s stout defense, led by junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley and senior defender Autumn Altimirano. Stanley and the backline have recorded two shutouts this year, while Ponce and the Wildcat offense have tallied six goals twice this year.
“They are a team that’s a lot like us,” the seventh-year coach said. “They work extremely hard, but things haven’t necessarily gone their way this year.”
Arizona has been solid this year on the defensive end as well. Goalkeeper Gabby Kaufman has been a picture of consistency, allowing 14 goals in 14 appearances and recording three shutouts.
It will take a strong offensive effort from the Women of Troy to break down the Wildcats’ defense, which has  but newfound offensive star Alex Quincey should play a role. The junior midfielder posted her first two goals of the season in dramatic fashion last weekend, and should continue to contribute.
The venue change is good news for the Women of Troy, who are 27-9-3 all time at the Coliseum. That record includes two wins over Arizona in the 1990s, both of which featured six-goal efforts from USC.
“It’s always exciting to play at that venue,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s really evidence that the administration supports us and has confidence in us.”
USC will take the rest of the weekend off after facing the Wildcats and are looking forward to a road trip to Colorado and Utah next week. Friday’s game will be televised live by the Pac-12 Network, with live online broadcasts on the Pac-12 website and USCTrojans.com.

In the days leading up to Ed Orgeron’s debut as USC’s interim head coach, the focus was on the team’s newfound sense of fun and enthusiasm. The focus of this week’s matchup against Notre Dame, however, took a more businesslike approach.
Pocket presence · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler has averaged just under 300 yards in USC’s past two games. “I can see the guys starting to believe in him,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Obviously, the first week was a little different, when everyone was all fired up,” Orgeron said. “But we’re still fired up, and we’re still practicing well. It was new for them the first week, but I know they’re gonna be really fired up come Saturday, no question.”
The Trojans head into South Bend, Ind. fresh off of their first Pac-12 victory of the season. USC led Arizona comfortably for most of the game, but surrendered two late touchdowns that made the final score 38-31. Orgeron knows that for his team to perform better against Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees, the secondary needs to improve.
“Protect against the deep ball,” Orgeron said when asked what the key was for the defense to succeed. “We can’t let guys get behind us. We’ve worked hard on it, but we’ve still got some improvement to go. But it’s all about the pass rush. If we play good, solid football, we’re gonna be fine.”
USC should welcome back key players in both the secondary and pass rush on Saturday, as redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown and senior linebacker Morgan Breslin are both expected to play. Brown started for the Trojans in their opener against Hawai’i but left with a knee injury, and Breslin missed last week’s game against Arizona due to a hip injury. Despite missing two games this season, Breslin is tied for the team lead with four sacks.
Rees’ career at Notre Dame has yielded up-and-down results. He took over as the team’s starter midway through his freshman season and led the Irish to a 4-1 finish, including a 20-16 win over USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He started his entire sophomore season, as Notre Dame went 8-5, but was benched in favor of Everett Golson during Notre Dame’s run to the BCS National Championship game last season.
This season, with Golson suspended, Rees has thrown for nearly 1,500 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions. He has struggled of late, though, completing just 42 percent of his passes with six touchdowns and four interceptions in Notre Dame’s last three games.
On offense, the Trojans will likely be without their most productive weapon in redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden. Madden injured his hamstring against Arizona, and Orgeron said he was doubtful that Madden would participate in Saturday’s game.
If there ever were a position that USC could afford an injury, it would be at running back. The Trojans gave snaps to five of their scholarship running backs against Arizona, and they combined for over 200 yards and three touchdowns.
“There’s always gonna be room for improvement with us,” senior running back Silas Redd said. “We’re never satisfied, and we come out here with that mentality everyday.”
With a running game that appears to be playing to its full potential, the passing game for the Trojans is also starting to find its stride, and could receive a huge boost in the return of junior wide receiver Marqise Lee. Orgeron said that he expects Lee to play on Saturday, though was unsure to what extent his star wideout would be used.
The maturation of redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler has also contributed to the improved offensive play. Since being named the full-time starter, Kessler has thrown seven touchdowns and just two interceptions, and in his last two games has averaged just under 300 yards per game. This has led a belief in Kessler that he finally is in control of this team.
“I’ve felt like that [since] the Boston College game,” Kessler said. “I’m 100 percent in control and 100 percent confident. I feel like this is my team. Marcus Allen came in and told me, ‘This is your team, you’re the quarterback. You have to play for these guys, and they’re gonna play for you.’ I feel like I’ve done that.”
USC has won nine of the last 11 meetings with Notre Dame, and has not lost in South Bend since 2001. In each of Notre Dame’s last two victories, the Trojans were forced to play their backup at quarterback — Mitch Mustain in 2010 and redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek last season. USC has not lost a nonconference road game since 2002.
Saturday’s game is scheduled to kickoff at 7:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast nationally on NBC.

The remake of Carrie comes out this weekend, marking the latest in a long line of recent remakes of horror classics. In recent decades, we’ve seen remakes of such classics as Friday the 13th, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Thing and plenty of others. The reasoning is simple: These movies are horror classics, but their visual effects are lacking in comparison to those of today’s movies. So, take their already proven-to-be scary material make it shiny and new with modern technology, and presto! You have a can’t-miss on your hands. The only trouble is that they have largely failed, especially when remaking the biggest classic horror films. In taking advantage of the ability to expand on more plot points, the films often end up showing too much and losing their well-crafted suspense.
The idea of updating these films with effects geared toward a modern audience has its merits. I’ve talked to a good number of college-aged students who dismiss most of the horror classics because the effects just aren’t convincing, so they don’t feel scared. If a film can’t suspend your disbelief, then it will be difficult for it to make an impact on you. So, since this is an actual problem for young men — usually the most important demographic for horror films — then it is worth addressing. Simply filming the same story but with updated effects, however, hasn’t made for very appealing movies. The best litmus test of this is Gus Van Sant’s 1998 Psycho remake. The film is infamous for being a shot for shot recreation of Hitchcock’s original with updated content (such as explicit masturbation where it was only implied before, and more realistic violence). The film bombed, as its lack of originality was widely cited. Two other films that faced similar complaints were 2007’s Halloween and 2009’s Friday the 13th. One common word used to describe them was “unnecessary.” So, the public has largely spoken: Even if the effects can be updated, there has to be something extra or else they won’t care.
This pressure to change more in film remakes runs into the even greater danger of changing too much. Namely, while updating a film, the risk of showing too much becomes very real. A very common tactic in horror movies of the past was to not reveal or keep the monster in the shadows for a large part of the movie. This was often out of necessity, as they were unable to create a realistic-looking monster to present to the audience, but it allowed directors to adapt and take advantage of the fear of unknown. Any monster shown on the screen is less scary than one that has been allowed to grow in the spectator’s mind.
This is most notable when comparing Alien with Aliens. Both are great movies, but only Alien is a horror film. In it, the monster barely appears. The alien lurks in the shadows, and the audience is never really offered a good look at it, giving the viewer an added sense of fear while dealing with the claustrophobia of the spaceship. In Aliens, with a much larger budget, the creatures are fully shown and the film becomes a straight action movie in fighting directly against the monsters. It is a thoroughly entertaining action movie but it lacks the gripping suspense of the first installment.
So, this is the challenge facing the makers of the Carrie remake. They have to balance enough change for it to be necessary without changing too much and losing the actual horror. The original Carrie is beloved, and the idea of a remake was not warmly received by many of its fans as the original seems to hold up better than most other ’70s horror classics.
The creators talk a great deal about the ability to show things that they were not able to do in the original, but beyond this they also talk about being more faithful to Stephen King’s novel, the original source of the material. Brian De Palma’s adaptation changed a good amount of the story, partially out of an inability to film the larger-scale supernatural effects, and the creators of this remake strived to return to the book’s more expansive ending. It’s ambitious, and on paper, it seems to navigate those two competing criteria. It is interesting, however, to note that Stephen King himself has come out to say that he thought the original film was a marked improvement on his book. The importance of that statement is debatable considering the complete disdain King holds for the best film based on his works, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, but it is rare for an author to declare a film an improvement on their own work. Carrie was King’s first published novel and after publishing 49 more, and he now refers to it as the work of a talented amateur.
So perhaps going back to the original material will not be enough to save this latest in the long line of recent horror remakes. The only way to really know is to watch it, though, and Kimberly Pierce, the director of Boys Don’t Cry, and the talented cast she put together seems to give the film a better chance at breaking through where others have failed.

The largest and most authentic culmination of Taiwanese culture, the annual Night Market, is coming to McCarthy Quad today. An annual event hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Night Market is designed after a traditional Taiwanese night market, featuring carnival-style games, music, shops and performances.

“One of our goals is to educate the campus on different Asian Pacific American issues,” said Alison Chang, assistant director of APASA.
APASA hopes to accomplish this by providing as authentic an experience as possible for Night Market-goers. There will be games and activities, including the ever-popular street food, Mahjong booths and traditional performances including one from USC Kazan Taiko. One lucky market-goer will even win concert tickets to see Frank Ocean and Mac Miller.
“One of the coolest parts of this event is that we get to serve the entire USC student body with a night of games and fun, not just another boring culture lecture,” Chang said.
APASA is a cultural assembly under the USC Program Board and serves as an umbrella organization for smaller and more specific Asian Pacific American clubs and organizations on campus. Each club and organization under APASA will participate and showcase their culture by running different booths at the market.
“This is one of the events where member organizations [under APASA] get to really get involved,” Chang said. “It’s a really great opportunity for them to interact as a constituency.”
Asian Pacific American organizations have the chance to showcase not only their own cultures, but also the ways in which their cultures interact and meld with other Asian Pacific American cultures.
One of the new installments at the Night Market is a new photo campaign, which Chang is especially excited about.
“This is something we’ve never actually had before and I think it’s going to be really awesome,” Chang said. “I’m excited to bring more personal awareness instead of strictly culture to the event.”
For the photo campaign, each student will have his or her picture taken and complete the sentence “I’m passionate about…” and a unique statement to complete the phrase. Each picture will be displayed along with the answer for the rest of the market-goers to see.
While the APASA Night Market has been around for several years, Chang is encouraging even more authenticity this year, while incorporating ways to learn about Asian American culture.
“I’m pushing for Taiwanese music and more authentic games and food, I’ve been to really great night markets and I love them so I really want to bring as much of that as possible to USC to be able to share it with everyone here,” Chang said.
The booths will provide different cultural experiences at every turn. One booth in particular Chang is excited for the USC community to see is the the Asian Pacific American trivia booth. Chang hopes the USC population will learn more about Asian culture than stereotypes and statistics.
“I feel like a lot of the student body might not know much about Asian American culture because, since we make up over a quarter of the student body, we aren’t actually seen as a minority.” Chang said. “However, in the scope of America, we really are a minority and people don’t know much about our culture.”
Chang’s love of Taiwanese culture is one of her inspirations for the Night Market. The opportunity for her and the other members of APASA to put this event together sparks memories from her home. To recreate those memories is something she’s excited to share and expose to the USC community.
“I am Taiwanese American … Any of my friends will tell you that I’m obsessed with Taiwan … Night markets are one of the biggest parts of Taiwanese culture,” Chang said. “Whenever I go back to visit, night markets are definitely my favorite part … This event brings a piece of my home culture and something that I’m totally in love with to USC.”
The Night Market is a free event that will take place at McCarthy Quad tonight from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

What do biokinesiology research and building haunted houses have in common? They happen to be the two passions and occupations of Dr. Todd Schroeder, an assistant professor at USC’s Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy. This weekend, Schroeder will test the results of his latest experiment, The Theatre of Terror in downtown Pasadena.

Schroeder moved to South Pasadena with his family in 2004 and was blown away by the number of trick-or-treaters in the neighborhood on Halloween. In fact, it is the same neighborhood where the 1978 film Halloween was filmed, as well as the 2004 Rob Zombie remake. Schroeder, who has always had a passion for horror and Halloween (his ringtone is the theme from The Exorcist), decided to embrace the spirit of the neighborhood by turning his home into an elaborate, free haunted house every Oct. 31.
After a few years, the quality of Schroeder’s haunted houses became the stuff of local legend. Neighborhood kids and Hollywood set designers alike admired Schroeder’s handiwork. In fact, over the past few years, Schroeder has helped design creepy “graveyard type stuff” for the TV shows Up All Night and Supernatural. By Halloween last year, during which Schroeder hosted more than 2,000 visitors, it became clear that his legend and popularity had outgrown his home.
Together with his neighbor, Scott Peterson, who happened to be born on Halloween, Schroeder formed Evil Twins Studios, with the intention of creating an annual haunted house charity on a much larger scale. The two found a dream location in South Pasadena’s Fremont Center Theatre, and Schroeder is quick to point out that “people say it’s actually haunted.” Just to be safe, Schroeder and his all-volunteer staff have spent the entire month of October making sure that’s the case.
Schroeder and his collaborators have developed an elaborate narrative for the Theatre of Terror, which will wind its way through the bowels of the former mortuary. A deranged director by the name of Max Wyczek is said to have been burned to death in the theatre in October 1963 because of a fire he started. Fifty years later, residents of South Pasadena have reason to believe that Max has returned.
Schroeder won’t elaborate much further, but he does reveal that Wyczek is also said to have “slaughtered his cast, killed his daughter [and] caused his wife to hang herself.”
Schroeder is personally financing the haunted house, but does not intend to make any money off of the project. The whole experience is a charitable venture, with all revenue being donated to the South Pasadena Arts Council, which supports the arts at South Pasadena schools.
In spite of the charitable nature of the Theatre of Terror, its production and publicity could hardly be described as amateur. A glance at Evil Twin Studios’ website gives one a taste of the quality of the company’s craftsmanship. Jennifer Bandich, one of Schroeder’s co-workers at the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, acts as the studio’s marketing director. A number of local radio stations and newspapers have also publicized the Theatre of Terror.
Bandich is confident there’s a significant market for the Theatre of Terror.
“We know Universal Studios and Knott’s Berry Farm are really pricey, but this is something fun that high school and college kids can afford,” Bandich said.
In spite of the company’s preparedness, Schroeder takes the risk of producing his haunted house in stride.
“It’s a gamble. Notoriously, haunted houses lose money for the first few years,” Schroeder said.
Even if Evil Twin Studios doesn’t work out (which seems unlikely), Schroeder will always have his teaching and research at USC to go back to. So far, he has managed to keep his work at USC and his new company completely separate.
Interestingly enough, many of his neighbors think he’s a professional set designer. Schroeder’s reputation in his neighborhood should boost attendance at the Theatre of Terror. His house, which is only two blocks away from the theater, will not be haunted this year. Schroeder, however, will likely give out discount tickets to the theater to disappointed neighbors on Halloween.
Bandich will be out front selling tickets and taking care of the business side of things. Schroeder, however, will be inside the theater as one of the performers.
“If you see a large werewolf, that’s probably me,” Schroeder said.
Though South Pasadena might sound distant from USC, it is easy to get there via Metro. From campus, take the Expo Line to 7th Street Station, and then transfer to the Gold line and disembark at South Pasadena Station. The Theatre of Terror is only a couple of blocks away. The haunted house will debut this Saturday night and will be open every night from Thursday to Saturday for the next two weekends.
Everyone please come check out the haunt! Dr. Schroeder is my boss, I’ve been witness to his passion for all things scary for the past 5 years and I promise you will not be disappointed!
Reader Correction: after proofreading the article above, it sounds like the title should actually be, “USC professor creates haunted house in South Pasadena”
Love it!  I’ll have to check the house out this year.  Don’t remember seeing it or hearing about it.  :)

Instead of shutting down the Row, administrators need to find a better solution to campus drinking problems.
Let’s face it: Though the government shutdown might be over, USC students have a different problem to deal with it — The Row shutdown. The administration’s choices are solving all the wrong problems. By ending weekday parties, the administration does not properly address the larger problem of student drinking habits.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
The shutdown has been a response from administration due to multiple transports this past weekend, as well as to a Loyola Marymount University student who is in serious condition after falling off a table at a party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Student Affairs characterized last weekend as the “worst weekend of the semester” in a letter to all Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council organizations.
A memo sent by the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Beth Saul and Associate Director for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development Ray Carlos has since extended the rules of the shutdown, stating that fraternities and sororities can only host registered events between Friday at 3 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m.
The new rules also state that students will be required to show USC identification to attend events, and registered events must also be approved by the Los Angeles Fire Department. SAE is also on social probation.
But The Row shutdown is not going to change student drinking habits; it is simply going to change where they drink. Instead of houses with the Dept. of Public Safety within arm’s reach, other off-campus apartments and houses will become the new arena for drinking. This has been demonstrated by a surge in the number of Facebook events dedicated to such parties. It is time to find a permanent solution to dangerous drinking habits rather than the administration’s short-term solution of shutting down an entire community.
Furthermore, in dire situations, students afraid of getting into more trouble with the university or prolonging the shutdown of The Row will have absolutely no motivation to get their friends medical attention should they become overly intoxicated.
While the administration seems highly focused on implementing punishment, limiting the days of the week in which students can host parties is not a proper solution. This is not the root of the problem. Possible solutions include requiring more alcohol education events for both Greek and non-Greek students.
The current consequences paint a negative picture of the Greek community as a whole. These incidents grant the media yet another opportunity to degrade the Greek community. The fact is, the individuals transported were not all USC students, nor were they all for sure involved in the Greek community. Many reports fail to include the fact that while there were indeed eight transports this past weekend, only four of those transports actually occurred on The Row.
Making Greek organizations a scapegoat for an entire community’s drinking habits might sound credible in newspaper reports, but it is unethical in practice.
Also, the accomplishments of Greeks are often overlooked. Greek students hold some of the highest GPAs at this university. Greek men and women also host weekly philanthropic events. The shutdown now prevents these events from being held, in addition to parties.
College acts as a threshold for students who are about to enter the real world. Punishing students as if they are children does not do much to facilitate this oncoming real-world experience and does not create more responsible students.
Caroline Kamerschen is an undecided sophomore. 
 
The administration is looking out for the best interests of the students in their decision to shutdown The Row.
Last weekend was what the administration termed one of the worst weekends The Row has ever seen for transports. Some measure of order and safety must be brought to The Row in the wake of these events. Dr. Ainsley Carry, the vice provost for Student Affairs, was absolutely correct in his decision to more strictly enforce the SCampus policies already in place for parties on The Row. USC has a moral obligation to keep students and visiting members of the community safe while near campus.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
It’s important to first understand that Carry and the USC administration are not imposing new rules or regulations on The Row; they are simply enforcing the rules already codified by section G.6 of SCampus. The Row should be aware of these rules, since the rules govern its parties. No one should have a legitimate expectation that USC rules will go unenforced.
More importantly, though, USC has an obligation to keep students and the general public safe. USC cannot tolerate parties that endanger people. Row parties are too often unregulated; it is too easy for underage drinkers or people who have already had too much alcohol to acquire more, and over-intoxication leads to injury. Negligent behavior, such as the accident at Sigma Alpha Epsilon last weekend, can cause permanent and serious harm to people, and USC has an obligation to act.
USC students need to remember that this is about more than just wanting to prevent students from having a good time. USC wants students to have fun, as no one would want to come to this school otherwise. Part of the reason that USC permits Greek life at all is so students can socialize and have fun. But, as Carry noted, the Greek community has been unable to “promot[e] a safe and orderly social atmosphere through self-governance” this semester, and USC has a greater obligation to safety than to unruly parties.
Naturally, the university cannot reasonably expect that The Row or the USC community will follow SCampus policies exactly. As Neon Tommy senior opinion editor Francesca Bessey noted in her opinion article published on Wednesday, “Shut-down policies simply aren’t effective here. They leave students feeling angry, insulted and eager to find a loophole.” Just as Prohibition did not make the United States dry in the early 20th century, a dry Row is wishful thinking at best. Clearly stating that SCampus policies will be enforced gives USC officials and the Dept. of Public Safety the tools they need to deal with unruly parties and try to keep people safe.
Everyone involved in these kinds of parties might also have legal obligations to keep people safe. The university and SAE could potentially be liable for claims against insurance for the injuries of last weekend. The university has reasonably chosen to act to prevent negligent behavior, which could result in tort claims in addition to proving a threat to safety.
Safety is the university’s biggest concern when making these decisions. If The Row has to make some sacrifices to prevent injury, then that is a price it should be willing to pay.
The five traits of a Trojan are Faithful, Scholarly, Skillful, Courageous and Ambitious. It’s time to add “Responsible” to that list as well.

LAPD needs to bring in the drug dogs and raid some of the more notorious houses for cocaine and other hard drugs.  Everyone knows this is going on in a major way.  Too bad the administration lacks the courage to do something about it.
Are you talking about Pi Phi?
We have a weak President, a Provost who is a dictator, and a VPSA who has a low opinion of USC.
If you hate The Row, you hate America
This only effects houses below us.  So pretty much everyone but us.
You guys are a house full of brainless muscle heads and everyone knows it.
This is incessant  “USC has a moral obligation” haha that’s a bit much. This school wastes more money treating paying students like babies. Maybe USC doesnt acknowledge that in the real world, pple make choices, some which have us fall on our faces, be it student non student, transient, rich man, that’s called learning, would seem obvious to an educational institute. the more restrictions they erect, the worse it will get. The fact is they pay for the education not for babysitters to watch them have lives outside of studying. So its better they go off campus and get wasted and drive back? that’s definitely safer i bet.  I could never have attended school here,

Producer and MC Curtis Cross, better known to the hip-hop world as Black Milk, released his newest album on Tuesday, titled No Poison No Paradise, which is already proving to be one of the year’s best and most unique hip-hop albums.
The hype surrounding the release has not gone in vain, with Cross creating an album that is sure to be talked about for the rest of the year.
What distinguishes No Poison No Paradise from other albums released so far this year are the unique blends of different genres of music, all layered to create a complex, highly engaging album that feels more like a symphonic experience than a roster of rap singles. Guest artists on the album, which include Black Thought, Robert Glasper, Dwele and Quelle Chris, speak to this alternative direction that the album takes.
The tracks on No Poison No Paradise don’t feel like beats engineered in a studio, but rather sweeping musical compositions that draw on rhythms and melodies from jazz, soul and electronic music to create a wholly unique sound. Hazy background vocals, skittering drums and rich electronic beats create a lush soundscape that allows the listener to return again and again to the album and discover something new each time.
Additionally, this album features Cross taking a different approach to his rhymes, with a running narrative throughout the album about the hardships of growing up in an urban environment. Cross’ delivery is hard and clean, and he manages to rap about serious issues without taking on the didactic tone that many non-mainstream hip-hop albums can fall into. Cross evolves into a storyteller throughout the album, weaving scenes about the challenges of everyday life.
The opening track on the album, “Interpret Sabotage,” featuring Mel, sets the sonic tone for the rest of the album. The atmospheric opening piano chords, Cross’ rapid-fire delivery, his cleanest on the album, soulful backing vocals and hard-hitting electronic pulses all maintain the essence of Cross’ different genre influences, and at the same time mold them into a fresh new sound.
The two stand-out tracks on the album, “Sunday’s Best” and “Monday’s Worst,” are exceptional in their production, drawing on Motown-influenced vocals, driving drums, pulsating electronic beats and recordings of everyday life on the street to create an excellent sonic summation of Cross’ influences and aspirations with this album.
These tracks not only provide engaging lyrics for the more lyrically minded hip-hop heads, but generate beats that can be blasted on car speakers while driving through the streets of Los Angeles. In the end, No Poison No Paradise is an album that appeals to many different kinds of music listeners, from the production-minded to the more rhyme-oriented fans.
There are moments during the album when Cross allows instrumentals to take center stage, letting the listeners immerse themselves into the sonic landscape that he’s created. This takes Cross’ album beyond the genre boundaries of hip-hop music, challenging the listener to take conflicting genres of music and reconcile them into a whole.
The combinations of jazz, soul and electronic music on these tracks create a wholly different soundscape than the predominantly electronic or jazz-heavy albums that dominate hip-hop music today. It is a soundscape that takes a wide variety of musical influences and combines them in surprising ways to create a varied and interesting musical journey.
There is no distinguishing melodic line that runs through the entire album. Instead, each track works with each genre of music differently, sometimes drawing on a genre such as jazz for its rhythms and other times for its melodic lines. Each song can stand on its own, yet all of the tracks work together to generate a well-rounded mood for the album.
No Poison No Paradise emerges as an album that is best listened to from beginning to end, following the musical and narrative progression that Cross creates with each passing track.
The end result is a hip-hop album that can stand as an engaging listen long after the hype surrounding its release has died down.
What Cross’ album represents is a move towards the genre-bending music that is beginning to define the playlists of more and more listeners. In an industry that is constantly feeling the pressure to generate sounds that push the boundaries of traditional genres, No Poison No Paradise proves that time spent in the studio and an honest effort to create something that can engage listeners beyond a novelty factor can generate an album that can be listened to again and again, long after any musical trends have died down.
The sounds on No Poison No Paradise are representative of one of the most creative minds in hip-hop today. While the genre-crossing tracks might prove challenging to many genre purists, the wide variety of musical influences and Cross’ lyrics allow new listeners multiple gateways into the unique soundscape that is Black Milk.

The L.A.-based non-profit Drop in the Bucket takes the issue of water scarcity to heart but that doesn’t stop them from having a good laugh. On Friday, Oct. 18th, Drop in the Bucket will hold a benefit comedy night at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. The show, Laughter is the Best Medicine, begins at 8:30 p.m. and will feature a talented trio — Noel Fielding, Bobcat Goldthwait and a surprise guest. Noel Fielding hails from the U.K. and is best known for playing Vince Noir in The Mighty Boosh. Bobcat Goldthwait gained fame for writing and directing World’s Greatest Dad as well as his role in the Police Academy Series.
The novel combination of comedy and charity work is nothing new for Drop in the Bucket. Since its founding in 2006, Drop in the Bucket has found creative solutions to help alleviate poverty in Africa.
After visiting sub-Saharan Africa with a travelling doctor, Stacy Travis realized that many of the recurring illnesses could be prevented rather than merely treated. The root cause of several deadly diseases, such as malaria and cholera, is contaminated drinking water. Drop in the Bucket grew from this insight and has completed more than 200 water-related projects in six countries. Their current focus is in Uganda and south Sudan, described by the U.N. as one of the world’s most underdeveloped countries. In addition to building wells, Drop in the Bucket also installs composting toilets and roundabout water pumps.
John Travis, the co-founder/president of Drop in the Bucket, said, “Though it may look like a water charity from the outside [Drop in the Bucket] is using social innovation to get children in school.” Travis explained that many people in sub-Saharan Africa walk more than three miles to obtain water. Naturally, this task takes up most of their day and prevents children from attending school. He notes that girls and women usually accomplish this daily feat. In south Sudan, one of the main locations Drop in the Bucket serves, less than 3 percent of girls have access to an education. Travis saw the opportunity to build wells as more than a chance to improve community health but also a way to encourage children to attend school. He cited the idea that increasing the education level of women and girls will help decrease poverty and increase the standard of living. Drop in the Bucket also fosters female empowerment through the Girls’ Clubs program. These clubs encourage girls to peruse education, provide information about health issues and provide basic toiletry products.
Travis reiterates that Drop in the Bucket “is not just about providing water” but about helping to improve living conditions. By strategically locating wells at schools, the charity is able to accomplish their dual goal of promoting health and education. Drop in the Bucket seeks to help break the cycle of “people with a severe lack of education raising people with a severe lack of education.” The charity views education as a way out of poverty and a pathway to a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle in Africa. Travis notes that wells created in south Sudan and Uganda constructed under the guidance of hydrologists and engineers and draw on pre-existing groundwater sources.
Unlike other international aid organizations, Drop in the Bucket has offices in both Uganda and south Sudan. Yet, they still have strong connections in Los Angeles and their headquarters in Los Angeles. On a much smaller scale, American cities also deal with water-related problems. Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Los Angeles all have their own issues with water. Travis calls Los Angeles “a city built on water” and feels that Angelenos will be “more conscious of water as a commodity.” He wants “to connect people in this country with people in Africa” because water scarcity is a global issue.
Despite the gravity of the issue at hand, Drop in the Bucket has always found ways to incorporate levity into its fundraising. Previous events have drawn on the entertainment industry — including a rock concert hosted by Henry Rollins. These events allow Drop in the Bucket to reach a larger audience and help make people more conscious of their daily habits. Even if the audience members only come for a laugh, they will leave with the knowledge that their contribution has helped to make a difference in the lives of others. Laughter is the Best Medicine will help to “get a point across” about how people can make a significant impact while having a good time. As Travis noted “the best comedy has a lot of truth in it.”
