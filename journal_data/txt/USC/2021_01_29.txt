It’s 2021. After almost an entire year of isolation and zero festivities, music brings solace to the mind and soul. An elegant melody accompanied by elaborate lyrics, occasionally adding energetic choreography and a colorful music video, music dominates the world. 
It’s time to forget about the physical isolation and discomfort. In the first month of a new year, why not allow yourself to fully immerse in music, be taken captive in the unlimited possibilities of lyrical wonders and heavenly harmonies?
January resonated as a fresh start for all. Let’s pick up the highlights of this month.
“Driver’s License” by Olivia Rodrigo (Jan. 8, 2021)
Ready for some heartbreaking love feuds? In a time of cold isolation, we definitely need a fiery spirit of passionate love stories — or breakup stories. Ranking No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200, “Driver’s License” marked Olivia Rodrigo’s extraordinary debut unlike any other. Listen to this Gen Z gently recite her broken heart as she drives past the suburbs, without the guy she thought was the one.
“Skin” by Sabrina Carpenter (Jan. 22, 2021)
Could this be her response to the “blonde girl” remark in “Drivers License?” Beginning softly, Sabrina Carpenter doubts the “gravity in the words [they] write.” But she soon launches into her blinding spotlight of a life, flaunting her long career in the music industry, slashing back at haters and softly responding to the newly-licensed-teenage-driver. While graceful lyrics discreetly tackle the injustices Carpenter faced, her strong yet majestically faltering vocal cords convey a sense of pride and utmost confidence that no one can “get under [her] skin.”
“Lie Lie Lie” by Joshua Bassett (Jan. 14, 2021)
Listen to this sharp farewell to an ex-best friend from the Disney+ star of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Despite much speculation from fans and the coincidentally corresponding release dates, Joshua Bassett sings about a betrayal from a long time friend, utterly irrelevant to the love triangle. Frequently revealing snippets of this song while working on it this past year, his dedication to the lyrics and music notes appear evident in the upbeat melody of the newly released “Lie Lie Lie.”
“De Una Vez” by Selena Gomez (Jan. 14, 2021)
Selena Gomez sings from her jeweled heart about her emotional growth through intricately weaved Spanish lyrics, poetically reciting self-empowerment. Proudly establishing her Latin American heritage, she immerses heartbroken listeners with precise words of healing encouragement, enticing a sense of empathic unity and compelling independence. After all: “Soy mas fuerte sola,” she asserts, “I am stronger on my own.”
“Nobody Is Listening” by Zayn (Jan. 15, 2021)
It looks like the coronavirus blues penetrated the musical blues by Zayn. His sad voice weakens into mumbles in his latest album, “Nobody Is Listening.” Unfortunately, Zayn’s intuition from naming his album stands uncorrected. The dismally isolated nature of his tracklist slowly rolled off the iTunes Top 100 into “Calamity” before barely balancing on the “Tightrope” at No. 22. Perhaps it was the overlapping dismay of the times that shrouded listeners from the potentially profound intent of creating personal music. Indeed, Zayn appears proud and accomplished to release music based on his creative journey as a solo artist for the first time. Despite the harsh chart records, it is never too late to appreciate the artistic value of Zayn’s intimate storytelling that resonates with purpose. 
“The Good Times and the Bad Ones” by Why Don’t We (Jan. 15, 2021)
True musicians, singers, instrumentalists — tune into this new album consisting of heartfelt songs personally written and composed by the band members of Why Don’t We during their tour and through coronavirus outbreaks. For an honest account of the good times and the bad ones, listen to the optimistic vibes of their new playlist.
“What I Said” by VICTON (Jan. 11, 2021)
Voice To New World (VICTON), these former romanticists are back with piercing vocals to celebrate their fourth anniversary. Adopting a unique Latin pop sound, these K-pop idols mix in brass instruments to create a dynamic dance hit. In the music video, VICTON fills the stage with powerful choreography, proudly claiming that “the future is now.” All seven members worked on this perfectly potent album, reflecting their accomplishments as artists and potential as future leaders of K-pop. 
“Anyone” by Justin Bieber (Jan. 1, 2021)
What about another sweet song for a golden 2021? The striking melody contrasts with soft lyrics dedicating his love for his wife, insisting that “if it’s not you, it’s not anyone.” Needless to say, the admirably pleasant nature of the lyrics address a heartfelt companion. Justin Bieber goes even further to don silk boxing shorts to fight for his love in this new music video.
“Life Rolls On” (Audio) by Florida Georgia Line (Jan. 15, 2021)
Is there a more wonderful way to address the times? To those anticipating the obvious, life proved unsettling after the sudden coronavirus pandemic. But as these country singers declare, the best alternative is acceptance of the “highs and the lows” and the “yes and the no’s.” After all, life rolls on.

As a celebration of the diverse stories that filmmaking as a platform provides, the 2021 Oscar qualified shorts showcase took place over Zoom Tuesday night. Following the screenings, a Q&A was hosted by Outside the Box [Office] with some of the talented filmmakers behind these masterful stories.
The creators of all but one short dove deeper into the history behind their films and the personal connections they have to their works, bringing a new level of appreciation for how arduous their labors of love were for them to create. 
The first film to screen was “Augustus,” directed by USC alumnus Jon Alston. The film follows Frederick Augustus Douglass, an escaped slave who has nightmares of a future where inequality is still plaguing the world. He then must decide whether or not to advocate for abolition at the risk of endangering his family.
Despite being a historical piece, the film uses projectors to visualize the nightmares that Douglass experiences, creating a haunting comparison between the inequality Black people faced in the 19th and today. 
The ending is intercut with video footage of recent police brutality, as the director said he felt strongly that the themes of Douglass’ story echoed the events of Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement.
“We wanted to take the events that people knew and make them more personalized to the story that we were telling so that it aided our protagonist’s journey towards abolitionism,” Alston said. 
The highlight of the Q&A came early on in a conversation with Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, the writer, co-producer and co-director of “Kapaemahu,” a short that tells the tale of the Māhū, the Hawaiian name for people who embody both masculine and feminine characteristics. The story follows powerful spirits as they become beloved by the native people for their acts of healing that giant boulders are hauled across the island and filled with their powers. In their honor, these boulders become a sacred site named Kapaemahu.
Wong-Kalu discussed the film’s historical significance and the challenges people in her culture face when they share their thoughts or assert their values. 
“So many elements of history, of language, of culture here in Hawai’i are often suppressed or ignored,” Wong-Kalu said. “By bringing this film forward we hope to encourage other filmmakers to do the same when they might be in that situation. To control the narrative.” 
While bringing awareness was a critical intent for the film, Wong-Kalu admits that this short was a spiritual journey for her as well. Several months ago, her partner passed away and Wong-Kalu cites him as the inspiration for the role of the healer in the film. While the hand-drawn and 2D animation were visually captivating, how healing connects people and the celebration of that care made the film profound. 
The most striking aspect of these shorts was the diversity among story content and ingenuity in animation styles. While animated films often do not get as much acclaim as their live-action counterparts, each director elevated the creative bounds of this medium to a refined form that complimented each story’s tone and message.
“Elo” was first hand-drawn in graphite pencil. Then a computer program was used to invert the colors where the shadows acted as the light and vice versa. The result was a dark, surreal fantasy that lent itself perfectly to the film. 
“Purpleboy,” directed by Alexandre Siqueira, is a metaphor-laced exploration of a young child, Oscar, who does not have a definitive biological sex but asserts that he is male. He grows in the ground, watered by his parents every day, until he enters the world ready to assert his identity.
The animated medium easily transforms the film’s visual surroundings as Oscar goes on his own internal journey. Parents morph from chickens and wolves back to humans once they accept Oscar’s gender, and Oscar melts into a pool of water to escape fellow children who bully him. These surreal dynamics add to the emotional punch of the narrative, leaving an impact on viewers.
The standout accomplishment in animation was Camila Kater’s film “Carne (Flesh),” the story of five women’s relationship to their bodies throughout all stages of life. Each chapter was animated in a different medium to best compliment the story told. Adolescent watercolor, menopause claymation and even painted 35mm film strips as a woman in old age recounting her time as an actress. 
Though the various animation styles are a distinguishing feature of this film, they were not part of Camila’s original vision. 
“It was supposed to be 2D digital, but I changed my mind during the interviews when I was hearing their stories, more precisely the first protagonist, when she was telling me the story of her mother,” Kater said. “She was fat when she was a child, her mother was a nutritionist and there was a lot of limitations in regard to food. So, I decided to animate in a dinner plate using real food.”
“Lost & Crowned” takes the world of the Clash of Clans mobile game and expands it into a cinematic universe. The 3D animation creates a more polished look that audiences are used to seeing from bigger studios. Though it did not possess the same experimental feel as the other films, fans of the mobile game are sure to be delighted by the expanded narrative arc of their favorite characters.
The live-action short “The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating” features an unexpected star: a common woodland snail. Based on a memoir, the narrator recounts the lessons she learned from a snail living in a potted plant on her bedside table while bedridden with a neurological disorder. 
Elisabeth Tova Bailey, who wrote the memoir and directed the short, had such acute observations and reverence for the snail that her love translated on screen in the form of well-composed cinematography that highlighted the snail’s unity with its environment.
Recording the titular sound of the snail eating was not an easy task, as it is such a quiet sound that the hum of the wires in any regular recording device would drown it out, Bailey said. 
 “There were many complications, it took me six years to get the sound of this snail eating different foods,” Bailey said. “We had to design specialized recording equipment where we recorded the sound of the vibrations through the food.”
Directed by Persian filmmaker Maryam Mohajer, the screening concluded with the four minute film “Grandad was a Romantic” — a story about the Persian ideas of passionate love at first sight with an ending twist, packing a punch and capping off the evening with comedy. 
Mohajer used a combination of materials from hand-drawn aspects to 2D animation and even cut out collages from old Persian manuscripts.
“I have a painting background and I like that whole handmade feeling to be present in my films,” Mohajer said.
The Oscars have long faced criticism for its lack of diversity among filmmakers and homogeneity of stories. Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” winning best picture last year gave many hope that the Academy would change. 
None of these shorts have been nominated yet, but the high proportion of films made by artists of color or international filmmakers in the running provides an optimism that more types of artists will finally get the mainstream recognition they deserve.

When the pandemic hit and many businesses moved online to mitigate the loss of in-person clientele, USC alumnus Jordan Banafsheha knew it was time to start the online advertising agency he had dreamed about. Despite the negatives of the new pandemic world, he said he was provided with a surprising opportunity: a niche for entrepreneurship. 
Icepop, a marketing and advertising company located in Los Angeles founded by Banafsheha in May, is helping companies grow their online presence.
After graduation, Banafsheha spent several years working for companies such as Tinder and later formed part of the co-founding team for social shopping platform Verishop. Receiving an overflow of messages from people who were referred to Banafsheha for help with creating an online platform, he decided to leave Verishop to focus on creating his agency full time.
With a tagline of “Grow Right,” icepop looks to help companies authentically increase their internet presence, Banafsheha said. This growth is achieved in a way that is personalized to each client, contrary to what he said many might believe about marketing. 
“A lot of people like to think that advertising is a playbook, and we just follow the same playbook for every account. It’s definitely not like that,” Banafsheha said. “Every company has a different amount of data, has a different brand voice, has a different customer group that they’re going after. Every client we take on, it’s kind of like ‘Is this the right fit for us?’ ‘Do we think we can deliver?’ ‘Do we think that we can craft a story that’s unique to them?’”
Icepop focuses on advertising through three main areas: paid social advertising, paid search advertising and organic search listings. 
In paid social advertising, icepop markets client ads through social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Snapchat. Its other two services involve Google and Bing, with paid search advertising, displaying ads at the top of search engine results and improving organic search, allowing the company’s page to naturally appear higher on search engine results based on the relevancy to someone’s search. 
Icepop has a range of clients including Madhappy, a streetwear lifestyle brand based in Los Angeles, and Euka, a wellness brand that has employed other big marketing agencies like 72andSunny, Banfasheha said. 
“Just being at the table with these types of companies at such an early stage of our company is really cool,” Banafsheha said. 
Another one of icepop’s clients is Mini Dreamers — a “one-stop shop” for all of the trendiest clothing for babies and kids — founded by Melody Nabati, a 2008 alumna, in 2016. Although she felt she had sufficient resources to make Mini Dreamers successful and received a lot of positive responses from the community when she first opened her business, Nabati said she needed help with growing Mini Dreamer’s online visibility.
Mini Dreamers, a current client of icepop who worked with Banafsheha for nearly three years before icepop’s official start, has grown almost four times from what it was before, Nabati said. 
“I’m really happy with the amount, the time, the dedication, [Banafsheha’s] commitment to our business,” Nabati said. “He’s really knowledgeable about what he does. And it’s been such a great asset to the company, especially during COVID.”
Garrette Wann, a contract worker for icepop, is directly involved in the creative aspect for the company — helping create media and videos for clients. Together, Wann and Banafsheha produce and market videos that generate revenue for clients. Working for icepop for nearly a year, Wann said he consistently sees icepop live up to their client’s marketing goals. 
“It’s a really good company,” Wann said. “I love working with them. They do really good by their clients, and they make sure you know what they’re going to do.”
Although the agency is still in its beginning years, Banafsheha said he hopes it becomes one of L.A.’s top advertising agencies within the next five years. Banafsheha also said, as icepop works with more businesses, he looks to branch the company’s services into investing and running performance markets. 
Banafsheha said some of the businesses who come to icepop have asked him to invest in or advise their company — an area he is open to as icepop grows. 
“As our business grows and we become bigger, I would love for us to have a very nice portfolio of brands that we also invest in and run their performance marketing,” Banafsheha said. “We’re more than just a service to them. We’re also a partner to them.”
Banafsheha said he had a collection of experiences at USC that helped contribute to his decision to create icepop, including an internship through USC TAMID, an organization that provides business-minded students with hands-on consulting and investing. 
For Banafsheha’s internship he traveled to Israel where he learned about Facebook advertising and paid online advertising. 
“If it wasn’t for that experience, I probably wouldn’t have learned how to do a lot of this stuff I do now,” Banafsheha said. 
The USC Blackstone Launchpad Community also helped Banafsheha grow his network and connections. As a result of his success with icepop and entrepreneurial experience, Banafsheha has given speeches about his background and company for entrepreneurship classes each semester since he graduated, allowing him to further connect with the USC community. 
Banafsheha said Anthony Borquez, one of the professors who often has him as a class guest, is a great mentor and has been able to introduce him to many students who have helped connect him with people who need icepop’s services. 
The relevance of media and marketing to modern society, as well as the current global pandemic, has created an environment that Banafsheha said he believes has allowed him to create a successful agency, benefiting both the exposure and success of all of his clients. 
“If it wasn’t for the pandemic, I don’t know if I would have started my agency this quickly; I might have waited another year or two,” Banafsheha said. “But because so many businesses were looking for people to help them advertise on Facebook and set up their Shopify and all those things, the demand was so big that it basically helped me make that decision faster.” 
Looking forward, Banafsheha said he hopes to hire USC students as employees and interns. Not only does Banafsheha foresee his agency’s growing success in the near future, but he encourages USC students to reach out and harness their own dreams of entrepreneurship as well.
“I want us to be, if not the best, one of the top three agencies in Los Angeles,” Banafsheha said. “When people think of advertising online, on social media, on Google growing their business, I want us to be in those top ranks. And I think we’re making headway.”

Correction: A previous version of this article misstated icepop’s client as Yukka, rather than the wellness brand Euka. A previous version also misidentified USC professor Anthony Borquez as Anthony Cortez. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Starting before the sun comes up, School of Pharmacy faculty and students, alongside physician assistant and nurse practitioner students, are front-line, contributing to Los Angeles’ vaccine distribution efforts by volunteering at the city’s various Vaccine Points-of-Dispensing sites. 
The city is currently operating five PODs to date, with locations at Lincoln Park, Crenshaw Christian Center, Hansen Dam, San Fernando Park and Dodger Stadium. USC School of Pharmacy currently runs the Lincoln Park location and contributes at Dodger Stadium, which is currently one of the biggest vaccine sites in the country.
Gilberto Peña, a first-year pharmacy student who volunteers at the vaccine distribution locations, said the amount of people in line everyday waiting to get the vaccine is so high that the volunteers must prepare for the day hours in advance. 
“We come in at 5:30 in the morning — you know it’s still dark, at 5:30 in the morning — to get set up,” Peña said. “By six we’re just drawing up doses, drawing up doses, just because we have thousands of people coming all at once. The gates don’t open ‘til eight but people start making a line around 6:30 in the morning.”
Despite the possibility of staying in drive-thru lines for hours on end, let alone hours past scheduled appointment times, those waiting to receive their dose of the vaccine at Dodger Stadium are more grateful than anything, according to Peña. 
“You would think they would be agitated, a little impatient, but it’s the exact opposite, which is amazing to see,” Peña said. “These people waiting upwards of six hours are really appreciative, are very happy, have so much positivity and just express their appreciation for us workers or us volunteers.”
L.A. County became the first county in the country to surpass 1 million cases on Jan. 16, and the data suggests that low-income Latinx and Black populations throughout the county are bearing the worst of it, the Los Angeles Times reported last week. 
“People living in the most impoverished neighborhoods of the county are now averaging about 36 deaths a day per 100,000 residents,” the L.A. Times article read. “By contrast, those living in the wealthiest areas are experiencing about 10 deaths a day per 100,000 residents.” 
The city’s distribution methods, which Mayor Eric Garcetti began Dec. 30, is a joint effort between the School of Pharmacy, L.A. County, the city of Los Angeles, L.A. Fire Department, Curative and the nonprofit Community Organized Relief Effort. Prior to vaccine approvals, these organizations worked together to host flu vaccination sites around the city to combat what many considered could be a “twindemic” during the winter months. 
Dr. Richard Dang, associate professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmacy residency program director, said that the flu vaccination and coronavirus testing sites were strategically placed throughout the city with the intention of eventually transforming them into vaccination sites when permitted. The current five locations were chosen in an effort to provide equitable distribution to underrepresented groups and ensure accessibility.  
“We are committed to getting as many vaccines in arms as possible,” Dang said. “Especially to helping reach out to those populations that typically may not trust the healthcare system, who may not have ready access to a healthcare provider, whether it be a clinic or a pharmacy or hospital, or even those who may have transportation issues who can’t get to these POD locations.”
Addressing vaccine hesitancy by engaging with the community is also a priority amid distribution efforts, Dang said. 
“Do you have concerns about vaccines? Let’s host a talking forum or a webinar for members of your community, for your particular organization,” Dang said. “Those conversations are ongoing right now, so that we can provide our partners in our community who are surrounding the University with as much information as possible to tackle vaccine hesitancy to encourage as many people as possible to receive the vaccine, and to make sure they actually have access and the ability to receive the vaccine, regardless of the circumstances.”
Dand said he hopes to reassure skeptics that the vaccine is safe and recommended everyone receive it when it becomes available.
“The vaccine has not skipped any steps, has not cut any corners and has gone through rigorous scientific clinical trials,” Dang assured. “A large number of experts have looked at the data and came to the same conclusion that it is safe and effective, and that the risks do not outweigh the benefits of the vaccine.”
A survey conducted by Pew Research Center published in December said approximately 60% of responders would get vaccinated and hesitancy is apparent throughout the country. However, Britnee Campos, a second-year physician assistant student, said she’s pleased with the turn out she’s witnessed so far while volunteering. 
“Even though there’s a lot unknown about the vaccine and long term what’s going to happen and there’s a lot of uncertainty with the vaccine itself, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the excitement and eagerness of everyone to get the vaccine and try and do their part to make this pandemic end,” Campos said. “It’s been a very surreal experience volunteering … and at the end of the day I just feel so grateful to have been able to get the opportunity to volunteer in the first place.”
Peña expressed a similar sentiment and said witnessing first-hand the efforts of healthcare workers and the enthusiasm from vaccine recipients has provided him a sense of hope.
[We’re] seeing a lot of division lately, but it’s really nice to really see all these different professions and representation — nursing, the fire department, pharmacy — everyone really coming together for a good common cause which is [to] really roll out this vaccine to healthcare workers that are putting their lives on the line, and now the elderly,” Peña said. “That’s really a good thing to see, and it provides a ray of hope to see people put differences aside and really come together for a common good.”
As of Jan. 12, 525,747 doses of the vaccine have been administered throughout the county, according to the L.A. County Public Health Department. Going forward, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a new priority list that is age-based rather than occupation, raising concerns over the risks front-line workers will continue to face. Still, the efforts from volunteers at these vaccination sites are slowly, but surely, contributing to the end of the pandemic, Campos said. 
“Seeing the relief on their face like [the vaccine is] one added layer of protection for them, and then for the older adults that we got to vaccinate — just seeing the glimmer of hope that they’ll be able to go back to the grocery store one day and see their families and not have to worry so much about like stepping outside,” Campos said. “I think that’s the most motivating part of it is just seeing that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel, you know.”

The domestic terrorists who incited the Jan. 6 insurrection, the Senators that blocked former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment and all the elected officials who have agitated this violence over the culmination of Trump’s four years in office must be held accountable politically and legally. Following the insurrection on Capitol Hill, many U.S. political pundits adopted the phrase “unity without accountability” to address hollow steps towards peacemaking in Washington D.C. 
The word “unity” has lost all meaning when we decide to unite with white nationalists instead of convict them. 
Vague calls for unity are weaponized as a means for people to virtue signal while comfortably remaining neutral to prevailing racial and socioeconomic crises. Despite the obvious implication, claiming the need for unity doesn’t require the government to actually have a plan to achieve unity. It’s used as a national defense mechanism in response to the peoples’ complaints about ineffective government. Calling for baseless unity is a meaningless practice and can be harmful to the state because it allows the government to settle without taking legal and legislative accountability for the past four years. 
Unity without accountability is dangerous because it reframes optimism to be a performative encounter with justice. It promotes a toxic positivity mindset, discouraging people from looking further into the systems of injustice that overwhelm our institutions. Citizens must expect more than unity speeches by actively being engaged with how the government is going to ensure accountability for the Trump administration’s complicity in corruption and criminal offenses. Beyond pursuing justice directly against the Trump administration, citizens must apply pressure on the Biden administration to ensure that repairing “the soul of our nation” is more than a campaign slogan. 
People should not be discouraged from feeling optimistic about this new administration; there is relief, hope and restoration in decency. However, citizens should expect more legislative action from Congress and start organizing action on the ground within the communities closest to them.
Help increase civic education within your family or friend group, donate to local relief funds or mutual aid networks, or join an organization focused on an issue you care about. There are many non-electoral activities citizens can participate in to continue to hold elected officials accountable and impact  their communities. 
The USC community is not immune to unity without accountability too. Following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, many students were underwhelmed with Carol Folt’s response to student demands for USC to address anti-blackness on campus. Holding a series of diversity training sessions is not going to uproot the systemic racism embedded into higher education institutions such as USC. This type of call for unity is a good start but plateaus as performative. 
As USC rebrands its Trojan Family values to include diversity, equity and inclusion, organizations like the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE) have called out USC for “being unable to uphold its commitment to equity and inclusion when it comes to how it treats its own employees.” USC needs to examine diversity, equity and inclusion beyond the task forces and webinars and must be held accountable for lack of action to protect students’ and faculty’s intersectional identities. 
In the midst of a pandemic, socioeconomic unrest, racial inequality and democratic instability, the USC community must look inward to recognize and rectify past performative calls to unity. 
The Trojan Family should mean something more substantive than a reference to the alumni network or a football chant. Student activists and coalitions have kept USC on its toes about how they will ensure all-encompassing equity. Those who commit to holding the USC community accountable for past mistakes and are supportive through the redemptive process exemplify what the Trojan Family should look like at USC. 
The word “unity” is thrown around to make people feel safe, but we must reconcile with the hard truths behind the semantics of the word. Calls for unity happen because there are real issues that deserve uncomfortable conversations, controversial decisions and nuanced messaging. The “unity” used in thematic political speeches or copy edited into email newsletters almost always feel performative because there’s no intent to indulge in such conversations. 
To achieve meaningful unity, there must be a willingness to break down norms and be vulnerable to new practices. If we do not grasp the pattern of unity without accountability in institutions like the government or universities, these flawed systems will remain unchecked. Don’t fall for vague phrases just because they are comfortable.

Top trending on Twitter Politics Jan. 25, 2020: “Biden administration looking to ‘speed up’ release of $20 bills featuring Harriet Tubman”
Events one to three days before: The Biden administration condemns Putin’s imprisonment and alleged murder-attempt of outspoken Russian Kremlin-Critic Alexei Navalny after 3000 of his supporters get detained in Russia, all while a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the two countries brinks on expiration. The Biden administration rejoins the Paris Accord and halts the United States’ exit from the World Health Organization. China enters its second day of flying warplanes over Taiwan, testing the Biden administrations’ stance on such a move and on China in general. 
All this in the middle of a pandemic with domestic issues of civil unrest, a second impending impeachment trial, public health and the inheritance of one of the worst economies in U.S. presidential history. 
It would be dishonest to claim that the Biden administration’s move to speed up the circulation of the Harriet Tubman clad $20 bills is of little significance. It is of great symbolic importance. During a slow news cycle, President Joe Biden’s move to speed up the circulation of the bill might be the top headline. Today, it is not. And probably not tomorrow either.
This is a caution to those who wish to see more justice and principled policy: Protect your attention from being hijacked by academic thinkpieces aimed at those with the privilege and luxury to ponder the importance of such performative actions.
While armchair social justice has risen across the board, in this particular transition of power where many seem to be breathing a sigh of relief, an influx of it feels imminent. It looks like an increase in viral articles riddled with high-minded intellectualism, meant to flex elevated levels of wokeness and mental agility. The issues they champion will be tempting to those with particularly pluckable heartstrings, especially after such a tumultuous presidential term. But it would be unwise to squander this unique opportunity to affect change by giving into those knee-jerk emotional temptations. 
Donald Trump left a vacuum in the Oval Office. Not to give him too much credit, but he did really challenge the form of what it actually means to be a sitting U.S. president. He said words we had never heard, openly did things we’d never seen and just two weeks ago, he was banned from Twitter! What was once unpresidential became presidential, and now, we just don’t know what that word means. As a result, we find ourselves with this rare chance to redefine the presidency. 
Now is the time to be paying attention to what is happening with the coronavirus relief, immigration reform, the preservation of DACA, what is happening with systemic racial oppression, what is happening with hedge fund bailouts, what is happening with U.S.-China relations and what is happening to crucial and brave freedom fighters like Alexei Navalny. It is time to tune into real news. 
We’re at a fragile moment in U.S. history. The people know it, the politicians know it, the billionaires in the illuminati know it (kidding … kind of). What’s more is that people are more politically active across the nation than they have been in decades. There is momentum for change, and there is a void to be filled. So just for this brief and critical moment, please sacrifice the slacktivism. Stop writing it, reading it and sharing it. Spend your political attention span wisely — it is worth a lot right now.  
To clarify, this isn’t to say don’t celebrate the good news either. On Jan. 26, 2021, Biden signed an order for the Department of Justice to end private prison contracts. This is a huge step in the fight for racial equity. Shout it from the rooftops, and tell all of your friends the great news — because it is real news. 
The Trump-to-Biden shift can be the dawn of much welcomed change. Or it can go back to the pre-Trump era of talking heads that do just enough to make you think everything is fine when the same old toxic potion bubbles and billows just below the surface. The choice is ours.
