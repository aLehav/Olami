On Thursday, Annenberg Innovation Lab hosted “Geek Speaks: The Women Who Make Television.” Focusing on the development of arts and technology, the event recognized women who have played pivotal roles within the television industry.
It’s all geek to me · Alexa Junge, a producer of the former hit show Friends, spoke to students on how her past experience has influenced her. – Kirstin Louie | Daily Trojan
 
“The goal of the Geek Speaks lecture series is to bring popular artists to campus to engage in thoughtful conversations that we think might be relevant to geeks here at USC,” said Provost’s Professor of Communication Journalism and Cinematic Arts Henry Jenkins.
The night featured two panels. The first focused on the creative process of the industry. Women from iconic television shows such as Friends, Fringe and The Vampire Diaries discussed how they began their careers, ranging from how they interacted and collaborated with mentors and employees to how they believed the media and audience can change the way in which their work has been produced and viewed. Erin Reilly, creative director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab, moderated the panels.
The first panel began by speaking about what television meant for them growing up in their childhood households. Julie Plec, co-creator and executive producer of The Vampire Diaries, discussed her love for soap operas as a child.
Melanie Chilek, on the other hand, discussed her experience working in television production and business within the industry.
“Reality television has its roots in journalism, and to tell stories in journalism, you ask a lot of questions,” Chilek said. “I was an avid and voracious reader and very curious. This propelled me for my career in the reality side and business side.”
Felicia Henderson, writer and co-producer of Fringe and Gossip Girl, started her career in her living room watching sitcoms as a child before her bedtime.
“Eight o’clock sitcoms are my favorite things in the world,” Henderson said.
Alexa Junge, producer of Friends, felt ’70s sitcoms shaped her understanding of human relationships. She began her career in theater, desiring to be a playwright until she started working at Nickelodeon.
“Many of the skills that I had were of value [at Nickelodeon],” Junge said. “The collaboration was so evident, because as a playwright the writing is so concrete.”
The panel also agreed over what they believed was the main barrier for female directors and producers. Though a common assumption would be that the main issues are pregnancy and family, the actual reasons appear to be gender and finance.
Asha Anderson, a sophomore majoring in political science, discussed how going to this panel would help her prepare to battle these problems when she enters the industry.
“I’m an aspiring writer and director for television and although I’m not in the film school, I thought it would be interesting to see how my gender, [which is] highly underrepresented in this industry, are treated in their careers,“ Anderson said.
The second panel focused on creative products. It dove into the harder issues that have arisen in past years — whether it’s in the content of their material or the issues their shows explore. The panel included women from prominent television shows such as Sex and the City and My So-Called Life and was moderated by Francesca Marie Smith, a member of Annenberg Lab.
Meg DeLoatch, co-executive producer of Disney Channel’s Austin & Ally, cites herself as a “TV baby.” She came to Los Angeles as an actress but realized a career as a writer would be more stable.
Women such as DeLoatch serve as inspiration for students such as Sarah Ortiz, a junior majoring in critical studies.
“I hear all this stuff about how difficult this career is for women, but I’ve gone to several of these panels, and this one was particularly interesting because I could hear the paths of these women,” Ortiz said.
Robin Schiff, executive producer of Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion, loved television as a child, saying she even picked her childhood friends based on their love for television.
“TV is the medium. I don’t hear anyone having long conversations about movies, but I do hear them for House of Cards and Game of Thrones,” Schiff said.

Speaking before a small crowd of students in the Stauffer Science Hall, USC professor and former CIA intelligence officer Maura Godinez spoke about the issue of intelligence leaks, specifically in relation to Chelsea Manning — formerly known as Bradley Manning — who was convicted after releasing classified documents to the website WikiLeaks.
The event was sponsored by the International Relations Undergraduate Association and the Center for Excellence in Teaching’s Undergraduate Fellows.
“The CET wanted to do a speaker series because our goal is to increase collaboration between students and faculty and facilitate learning inside and outside the classroom,” said Nick Kosturos, a junior majoring in international relations and an undergraduate fellow in CET. “When we were approached by the IRUA with this opportunity, we agreed to provide funding and hope this will become the first of a faculty speaker series.”
The event, “Manning: Soldier, Hacktivist, Leaker, Spy,” focused on the role of secrecy in government and under what, if any, circumstances leaking information is appropriate. Godinez began her talk by asking the audience to think about the definition of secrecy by considering some ethical case studies, such as publishing the names of those diagnosed with herpes simplex to prevent transmission of the disease. A theme she reiterated throughout the talk was the need to balance the desire of the leaker to expose wrongdoing with the interest of national security.
“No matter what good a leaker may achieve, there is always, in the national security realm, some loss, and we must weigh that damage against the good the leaker hoped to effect,” Godinez said.
Godinez also said that the threats arising from the leaking of information of any kind are real because foreign intelligence and terrorist organizations do not discriminate by source when gathering information about targets and, as a case officer, she personally utilized open source resources to build profiles of targets of interest.
“These are learning organizations,” she said. ”They would not exist if they did not learn about us and modify their behavior to respond.”
In addition, even if intelligence agencies are made aware of the scope and content of a                                                                                leak, replacing a leaked technological system, for example, can cost billions of dollars in lost research and development.
She said that due to the complicated nature of security oversight, civil society has a large role to play in defining the appropriate role of secrecy. Godinez mentioned that traditionally, the legislative and judicial branches have exercised limited authority over the executive in matters of state secrecy because Congress is “made up of adversarial parties” and judges “don’t have depth or breadth of knowledge” in national security matters, so the personal virtues of the executive branch and the media play a significant role in regulating state secrecy.
“There is an understanding among the intelligence community that information will come to the public eventually, and that serves as a check,” she said.
Godinez also said the issue of leakers and whistleblowers was particularly complicated because of the need to separate the personal motivations of the leaker with the common interest of the country. She said that intelligence officials who have sworn oaths to secrecy cannot divulge information simply because their personal values have been violated; they would instead have to resign.
If there is egregious wrongdoing and normal channels of redress have failed, Godinez said, then a truly altruistic leaker would expose the wrongdoing while taking steps to prevent a disproportionate threat to national security.
During the discussion period, students weighed in on the actions of Manning, including the leaking of a video of  U.S. Marines in a helicopter, war logs from the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the release of hundreds of thousands of state department cables.
“I didn’t know about the helicopter video and that was disturbing,” said Adela Jones, a junior majoring in interdisciplinary studies. “I was really surprised and really glad of the expertise of the students, and I was really glad that students were getting into it and thinking comprehensively about the issues.”
Godinez said that it was important for citizens to debate these issues and provide guidelines for intelligence and military officials, as failing to discuss meant “abrogating” one’s right to pass judgement.
“I think it’s good food for thought because we’re the next generation of voters and this is something to keep in the back of our mind to maybe pressure our elected officials about,” Jones said.

Dozens of students lined up in front of the Gwynn Wilson Student Union building Thursday morning in response to a mass email from the USC Ticket Office announcing major changes to the 2014 football season ticket rules. At noon however, the email was revealed to be an elaborate prank staged by Skull and Dagger Honor Society.

Students received an email on Wednesday evening stating that season ticket holders were now required to obtain reserved seats. The email further stated that only the first 3,000 students waiting in line on Thursday starting at 9:00 a.m. would be guaranteed a ticket.
“I thought the email was an April Fool’s joke, but I was walking by and I didn’t have anything else to do, so I figured I’d just wait in line,” said Jaffar Agha, a junior majoring in economics, while waiting in line. “I still don’t know if I really believe it. Maybe it’s true, or maybe when we get to the front they’ll give us a T-shirt.”
At noon, when students believed they would be receiving their assigned seats, Skull and Dagger members appeared in costumes in front of Tommy Trojan and fake ticket stubs were handed out. Some members unveiled a Skull and Dagger banner from the top of the Student Union and free pizza was given to the students who waited in line.
“I’m a freshman, so at first I thought it was real,” said Eliana Velasco, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “I figured maybe this was a normal thing. Now that we know it’s a prank, I’m laughing it off because I’m one of the ones who fell for it. Luckily not a lot of people showed up.”
The turnout of about 30 students was small compared to last year’s prank, which involved football star Marqise Lee and drew the attention of about 400 people and local news teams. This year’s email, however, stirred up controversy online.
“The Facebook groups were total chaos last night,” said Celina Caovan, a sophomore majoring in human biology. “A lot of us were really mad, because we had bought our tickets and were looking forward to the games, but we couldn’t wait in line because we had class. We freaked out for a while, but then we figured out that it had to be a joke.”
Some, however, predicted the news was a prank. Nathaniel Haas, a sophomore majoring in political science and economics and a Daily Trojan staff writer, wrote an article published on Neon Tommy Wednesday evening that questioned the email’s legitimacy.
“Look close at the email, and you’ll notice the sender:  uscto@usc.edu,” Haas wrote. “Sounds legit enough (to = ticket office). But if you’ve been harassed by the real ticket office for the last few months like me, you’ll notice that’s not actually their email address.”
Skull and Dagger’s annual prank is an initiation ritual for new members of the university honor society, which celebrated its 100th anniversary last April. Past pranks have included false announcements and fake raffles for Coachella and football tickets.
“As a new student here, I hadn’t heard of Skull and Dagger until last night,” Caovan said. “The whole thing was pretty stressful, but it was fun and creative. They really had us going.”

For many people, Shakespeare is an inaccessible, cumbersome obstacle of language meant to torture struggling high school students. Actors Erika Soto and Evan Lewis Smith used to think the same thing, which is why they want Shakespeare-haters to attend their production of Romeo and Juliet at the Independent Shakespeare Company. Opening today, the show has been condensed to a theater-friendly 90 minutes and contains whimsical movement, dance numbers and modern music to accompany the world’s most classic love story.

Soto, who graduated from USC’s B.A. Theatre program in 2011, plays the title role of Juliet. Smith, who graduated from USC’s MFA in Acting program in 2012, plays both Tybalt and the friar.  Both actors expressed their excitement for acting in such a classic Shakespearian show.
“You know what the show is and you know everyone else knows the show, so you have to ask yourself what kind of new things can you bring to it, while still being true to the message of the play,” Smith said.
As the Friar, Smith’s character gets to question the two lovers’ decisions.
“We’re saying, ‘You just met this guy, how can you love him?’ We’ve all been on the outside looking in, telling somebody you need to think about this,” Smith said. “But there have also been times when you know in your heart that’s what you want.”
Soto also discussed her connection to her character.
“I feel like it’s the perfect role for me right now,” Soto said. “Juliet evolves a lot through the course of the play. I know what its like to be young and in love and passionate and naïve and innocent and all these things. This is a time in my life when I’m just starting to discover myself.”
Soto and Smith are confident that audiences will be able to connect to the show as much as they have due to the universal themes. By shortening the production, the actors get to the heart of the love story more directly.
“Our take on it is, it’s taking out the air, the unnecessary weight, to focus on naive but true love and the adversity they go through. It speaks to so many people, its timeless,” Smith said. “Everyone has a bit of Romeo and Juliet in them.”
Soto is particularly passionate about presenting an accessible piece of theater. She remembers growing up speaking Spanish in Texas and, after reading Shakespeare in high school, remembered feeling incredibly intimidated by the language of Shakespeare’s plays.
“[Shakespeare] wasn’t for me. I thought ‘This isn’t something I can do.’ It was a foreign language,” Soto said.
Today, Soto loves the Bard, and hopes this show can transform other young students’ opinions of not only theater, but the playwright as well. In addition to the typical studio run, the production will have student matinees and will also tour local schools, where students will be able to go through workshops about Shakespeare and see a performance of the show.
Soto explained that she hopes the production will connect with students in particular. Soto’s sentiments fit directly with the mission statement of the Independent Shakespeare Company, which strives to make classical theater more accessible to new theater audiences. This show in particular, with its young characters and incredibly relatable themes of love and self discovery, is working toward that goal of bringing theater to people who are not typical theatergoers.
Not only does the production seek to grab the attention of audiences through its themes, but also through its innovative staging. ISC’s Romeo and Juliet is full of movement, dance, music and creative props.
“So many students assume Shakespeare is old-timey,” Soto said. The ensemble and production team has worked together to destroy that idea.
“It’s like kids going up into an attic and putting on a play with objects that they find. It’s an out-of-the-box fairytale,” Soto said.
After the show was cut, movement was used to fill in moments of dialogue that had been removed. Scenes such as the wedding are expressed through dance as opposed to speech.
Working as an ensemble was particularly important during these dance and movement pieces.
“It’s great working in an ensemble with everyone throwing creative ideas forth. Together we’ve had to figure out how to make a balcony without a balcony, how to make a room feel like an actual room,” Smith said.
Soto looks forward to the movement helping to change audience’s misconceptions about Shakespeare.
“I hope the audience can say, ‘Wow there’s so much you can do with this language and these plays,’” Soto said. “It’s not removed; Shakespeare isn’t limiting, it’s incredibly empowering and invigorating.”
Combining this creative storytelling with the traditional dialogue and poetic reading of the heightened language is bound to create a production that is not to be missed.
As Smith said, “We all have a bit of Romeo and Juliet within us.”
Romeo and Juliet at the Independent Shakespeare Company, located at 3191 Casitas Ave, runs April 4-May 3 at the Atwater Arts + Innovation Complex and offers student discount tickets. Buy tickets here.

It’s hard not to fall in love with Captain America. Even though the Avengers family consists of many good-looking, world-saving studs, none of the other heroes possess Steve Rogers’ old-school American chivalrous personality. Blonde hair, strong arms and six-pack aside, however, Rogers’ patriotic attributes alone will continue to cast a spell on Marvel fans in the new Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Not much has happened since the events of the first Captain America film, which ended with Rogers waking up from a 50-year nap. Though Rogers shows some progress in adapting to present-day society, he still seems out of place in the way he talks, acts and thinks. But it’s this same 20th-century mentality that makes him stand out from all the other characters and that will ultimately help him win his battle in what is the best film in the Avengers canon yet.
It all begins with S.H.I.E.L.D.’s newest invention: three satellites that are almost ready to be launched. In the first few scenes, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, explains the capabilities of such technology to Rogers. Fury tells him that S.H.I.E.L.D., through the use of complex algorithms, will be able to predict people’s behaviors, which will allow the United States to prevent threats before they even occur. Being the freedom fighter that he is however, Rogers is not impressed with Fury’s plans and begins to question the surveillance of U.S. citizens. Left with few he can trust, Rogers teams up with the sexy Agent Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), otherwise known as The Black Widow, to find the traitor in their agency, all  while struggling to stay alive.
Though the plot might sound predictable, don’t expect a typical superhero film with a linear story in The Winter Soldier. What makes Captain America’s second film so exciting is the surprises Marvel has in store for the audience. Just when the viewers believe they have deciphered the fate of the plot, something else entirely different happens. Marvel does not wait around for the viewers to get comfortable either. As demonstrated by — spoiler alert — the death of a main character within the first few minutes that will leave the entire theater in awe, unsure of how the movie or the series will progress with such a vital role terminated.
But the death of the character is balanced out by the creation of a new one: Falcon, played by Anthony Mackie, goes from being a minor character, Rogers’ running buddy, to sidekick,  joins the dynamic duo in bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. down. Moreover, Agent Romanoff’s history, which has been avoided in Iron Man and The Avengers, is mentioned briefly as well. The team’s operation will take Captain America back to the military barrack in New Jersey where he trained in the first film. The location of the barrack is not the only historical reference in the movie; Marvel also reintroduces many characters from the first film in unanticipated ways. Perhaps the biggest bewilderment of all is The Winter Soldier,  an antagonist whose skills match up to Rogers’ supernatural fighting abilities. When his identity is finally revealed, jaws will surely drop.
What makes The Avengers a successful franchise is that it’s more than just a movie. Marvel has created an entire realm where its devotees’ favorite superheroes interconnect. Not only do these superheroes get their own individual stories, but they also get a chance to unite in The Avengers film. On top of all the movies is the television show, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. These platforms combined make seeing The Winter Soldier essential for many moviegoers. Even those who do not favor Captain America should watch the film because it is a crucial component when making sense of the series. Minor details are used to remind the audience of these interplays: for instance, the Stark Industry stickers on some of the machines at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.
Parallels between the Marvel universe and reality help keep things interesting, too. The political and moral issue of spying on citizens has become a highly discussed subject in the tech world. To see it become a significant part of the movie helps merge the two worlds together smoothly.
Many fans have always been skeptical about Captain America’s superpowers. The serum did not make him immortal or invincible. If anything, it seemed like the only change after his extreme makeover was his post-puberty growth spurt and magically gained muscles. His shield, which he is seldom seen without, is also destructible in the comic books, leaving the so-called superhero with not much power. But in The Winter Soldier, the all-American heartthrob’s abilities become more evident during the action scenes, including one where he is challenged to fight without his iconic shield. But whether he has superpowers or not is not why his fans have stayed loyal to him, and definitely not why non-fans will fall in love with him in this film. The truth is, Captain America shows strength in times of weakness and this is why we love him.

Look at A Clockwork Orange’s Alex, Goodfellas’ Henry Hill, Scarface’s Tony Montana, The Wolf of Wall Street’s Jordan Bellford, Pulp Fiction’s Jules Winnfield, American Beauty’s Lester Burnham, Fight Club’s Tyler Durden, Gran Torino’s Walt Kowalski, American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman and Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle: all riveting characters, all antiheroes and all, interestingly, male.
I went to an all-girls high school. I’ve had enough of feminist rants for a lifetime, so just to be clear, that’s not where this is heading. Rather, I want to offer some food for thought — why does this imbalance exist? That being said, there is something very troubling about the disproportionate ratio of antiheroes to antiheroines, especially in film.
While doing research for this column, I came across a very interesting list on Flavorwire, “The 50 Greatest Movie Antiheroes of All Time.” Three female characters made the list: Young Adult’s Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), Batman Returns’ Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Bonnie and Clyde’s Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway).
Meanwhile, Al Pacino made the list four times for The Godfather’s Michael Corleone, Dog Day Afternoon’s Sonny Wortzik, Glengarry Glen Ross’ Ricky Roma and Scarface’s Tony Montana. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of our time and is undoubtedly deserving of his antihero accolades, but I find it hard to believe that he could singlehandedly pull four spots on this list when antiheroines as a whole couldn’t equal that.
Of course, the movie landscape today does not leave much room for antiheroines. Instead, this weekend’s moviegoers can look forward to heroic antics, much like those of The Hunger Games’ Katniss, now taking the shape of Divergent’s Tris. Now in its second week, the film has already been warmly received with a near $100 million haul at the box office.
By all means, let the heroines continue. We don’t have enough heroines either, but I like my characters morally ambiguous, amoral at times, even, and — I’m sure many others would agree — I could use an influx of heroines who are rough around the edges. Namely, I want to see more antiheroines.
Thankfully, television is much more progressive. In fact, it’s paving the way.
Before we continue, let’s establish a definition: An antihero is a protagonist or character who is typically considered to be very morally ambiguous. He could be a mob boss, meth cook or corrupt politician, to offer a few examples. Still, outliers have the support of the audience because they are much more complex than the archetypal villain. They have feelings, motivations and rationale that justify their actions, if only to a certain extent.
Breaking Bad’s Walter White, The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano, Mad Men’s Don Draper, Dexter’s Dexter Morgan, Firefly’s Malcolm Reynolds, 24’s Jack Bauer, Lost’s James ‘Sawyer’ Ford, House M.D.’s Dr. Gregory House, The Wire’s Jimmy McNulty and House of Cards’ Francis Underwood are a handful of many antiheroes.
But, they are met with equal, female matches. Consider: Weeds’ Nancy Botwin, Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Faith Lehane, Nurse Jackie’s Jackie Peyton, Girls’ Hannah Horvath, Scandal’s Olivia Pope, Homeland’s Carrie Mathison, Game of Thrones’ Daenerys Targaryen and House of Cards’ Claire Underwood. Perhaps not as extensive of a list in the grand scheme of things, but these female characters are equally — if not more — compelling.
Many of the female characters I just mentioned adhere to this definition.
Consider Claire Underwood.
She is just as devious as her husband and scheming counterpart, Frank, and yet she is entirely more complex. She is a woman (warning: spoilers ahead!) who evokes sympathy as she cries in a bathroom stall at a government event over her sexual assault. But, she is also a woman who maliciously performed a sexual act on an elderly former employee who confessed feelings for her on his deathbed. She is both sensitive and ruthless. She is entirely gripping.
Then there’s Game of Thrones’ Daenerys Targaryan. Yes, she’s reclaiming the throne that’s rightfully hers, but last season she was completely ruthless (Dracarys!) and yet we cheered for her as she sent the order for hundreds of men to be slaughtered. Simply put, she’s a bad b-tch and we love her for it, not despite it. I have no doubt that she will continue to wreak havoc as she ascends to power, and we’ll be there right there with her, thirsting for more.
To return to the battle of the sexes, an ordinary high school teacher motivated to pursue meth manufacturing isn’t so terrible when he’s dying of cancer and wants to provide something for his family, now is he? Also, he’s brilliant and delivers terrific one liners (“I am the one who knocks”), so there’s that. On the other hand, a twenty-something-year-old aspiring writer who is lovable (err, likable) but is completely obsessed with herself and her abilities as an artist is a very different story.
Maybe that’s where the problem lies. Perhaps, an antiheroine is not merely “a female antihero,” as Merriam-Webster defines it, but rather its own separate entity. Or, perhaps, viewers can’t accept an antiheroine in the vein of Hannah because her problems are miniscule by comparison, and the cons outweigh the pros.
Arguably, Hannah shouldn’t even be part of the antiheroine list, but her presence stirs up a few questions: Is an antihero/antiheroine someone we root for or someone we accept despite their flaws? Is there really that much of a difference between antiheroes and antiheroines or do they differ because of audience perceptions of sex and gender? Do audiences want to see antiheroines match their male counterparts in quantity and quality?
These are very loaded questions, and they can’t be answered simply. Television is taking a step in the right direction, and film needs to follow suit, but these media could still go so, so much further. Claire, Daenerys, Carrie, Jackie, etc., have all been popularly received. Why not take it further? What do we have to lose?
As an audience member, I can confidently say that I’m ready and wanting for more antiheroines. And as a woman, I want to see someone I can relate to, not just someone I understand.

Fifteen minutes of fame isn’t too difficult to achieve. Sustaining that fame and remaining relevant to audiences with short attention spans, however, is. Over the past three years, rising indie band Fitz and the Tantrums has experienced this firsthand.
The soulful septet from Los Angeles first emerged with Pickin’ Up The Pieces in 2010, and was lauded for its overt Motown and R&B influences. They booked a smattering of notable gigs, including big-name music festivals, but still the initial success made frontman Michael Fitzpatrick, the “Fitz” in the ban’s title, a little wary.
“When you make your first record, you have your whole life to do it, and you make it for yourself, and then you have some success, and you get some fans,” Fitzpatrick said. “Then going into the second record, all of a sudden questions creep up like, will they like this or will thy not like this?”
The concern became particularly nerve-wracking when the band decided to shake things up a bit for its sophomore effort. The band has been described using a trifecta label — soul-indie-pop — but there were many more elements of style it hadn’t yet tapped into. Fitz and the Tantrums set out on a mission to push against the constraints of its label to incorporate the different styles and influences that excited them musically.
Before putting out an album that would be a substantial evolution from their first, Fitzpatrick sought advice from experienced musicians that were on their third and fourth albums.
Fitzpatrick took their words to heart.
“Just trust what you do and if you love it, your fans are going to love it, too,” he said. “It feels great to know that the choices you made and all the hard work we put into the second record have paid off.”
Indeed, 2013’s More Than Just a Dream has spawned two big singles for the band, with “Out of My League” reaching No. 1 on alternative charts and “The Walker” receiving increasingly favorable airtime on the radio.
The album, which appeals to more genres and subsequently a wider audience, has solidified the band’s presence on the main stage. Moreover, it marks significant growth for the band, which Fitzpatrick feels has stepped into its own in its making.
“This record, even more than the first, really shows the diversity of the influences that all of us bring to the table,” Fitzpatrick said. “I love that first record from top to bottom but this record feels even more like we found ourselves as a group.”
Bear in mind that Fitz and the Tantrums is comprised of six members. Creating a cross-genre record that spoke to each musician’s aesthetic, style and influences and still felt true, authentic and real required a lot of work. Fitzpatrick described the writing process as a negotiation, a give-and-take.
“Somebody has to lead, but we have to be pliable and willing to hear outside influences and also know how to trust your instincts and really fight for what you believe is right,” Fitzpatrick said. “Ultimately, there was a lot of growth from us a band to collectively find that product.”
Part of that growth comes from recognizing that previous success doesn’t readily translate to future success, which is an oversight Fitzpatrick has observed in other artists that he is determined not to make.
“I think a lot of times, musicians will make the mistake of thinking that every idea they come up with is great, especially if they’ve had some success,” Fitz said.
The band wrote around 40 songs, which members then whittled down to the 12 on the album that survived the final cut. Those weren’t lucky accidents, though; they were carefully adjusted and rewritten to improve upon a first effort.
“The revision always feels like the better idea,” Fitzpatrick said. “I personally also believe that doing the wrong thing first really informs you what to do to make it correct.”
The success of the album’s venture into multiple genres means there’s room for even more expansion and exploration in future endeavors, Fitzpatrick said.
“We set up so much that I feel that now after being able to do everything so fully on this record, it leaves the gate wide open to let us do almost anything we want,” he said.
The L.A. natives return home for a sold-out show at the Palladium on Sat., April 5 before departing for an appearance on The Late Show with Seth Meyers in New York and then embarking on their summer tour.
“It definitely is emotional and a special thing.” Fitzpatrick said. “This is where we started, where almost everybody in the band grew up. This is a really tough town to crack and every time we’ve come back and done shows, we get to play in bigger venues.”
The size of the Palladium, which holds up to 3,800 people, is another sign that Fitz and the Tantrums is here to stay.

USC’s 13th-ranked women’s tennis team puts its undefeated conference record on the line this weekend in a trip to Northern California to take on two very tough Pac-12 opponents.
Stepping up · Junior co-captain Zoë Scandalis has moved into the top singles slot for the Women of Troy since her classmate Sabrina Santamaria injured her ACL. Scandalis is the nation’s 26th-ranked singles player. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy (14-4, 5-0) will face No. 12 California (12-4, 5-0) today and No. 4 Stanford (13-0, 5-0) tomorrow.
USC has currently won five straight matches, and is coming off of a 4-0 sweep of Oregon and a 4-1 victory over Washington at home last weekend. The only point the Women of Troy ceded all weekend was a 6-0, 6-0 loss in singles by sophomore Paige Keating in her first home appearance at USC since transferring from Ole Miss.
The Women of Troy have been working out the kinks in their lineup since losing junior Sabrina Santamaria for the season with a torn ACL. Before her injury, Santamaria was a stalwart on the top courts in singles and doubles. Santamaria paired with senior Kaitlyn Christian in doubles, and the pair won the NCAA championship together last year.
USC head coach Richard Gallien has been playing Christian with fellow senior Brynn Boren on court one consistently, and the pair has won three straight matches. Junior Giuliana Olmos and freshman Zoë Katz have been slugging away on court two, while juniors Zoë Scandalis and Gabriella DeSimone have been playing together on court three.
The Intercollegiate Tennis Association hasn’t quite caught up with Santamaria’s injury, as she and Christian are still ranked No. 22 in the nation together despite not having competed together since March 2 at Texas. Scandalis and Olmos, who were 22-7 on the season together before being split up, are ranked No. 7 in the nation in doubles, and Boren and Katz are ranked No. 12.
In singles, Santamaria is still ranked No. 15 and Scandalis, who has assumed the top singles spot for USC in her teammate’s absence, sits at No. 26. Olmos is ranked No. 69 and Katz is ranked No. 90 to bring USC’s total ranked players tally to four in singles.
Meanwhile, undefeated Stanford boasts six ranked players, headlined by No. 2 Kristie Ahn. Ahn and Carol Zhao make up the 10th-ranked doubles team in the nation. Taylor Davidson and Ellen Tsay are ranked No. 36 together.
Cal’s Zsofi Susanyi is the highest-rated of five ranked singles players for the Golden Bears (No. 14), while Anett Schutting and Maegan Manasse lead the way in doubles with a No. 43 ranking.
Earlier this season, the Women of Troy pulled off an upset over the Bears in a nonconference matchup at Marks Stadium. USC was ranked No. 9 at the time and Cal held the No. 4 spot in the nation. Susanyi earned the only point of the day for the Bears with a 6-3, 6-2 win over USC’s Boren, and the rest of USC’s team dismantled its opponents.
The success USC experienced in that match is certainly encouraging, but the Women of Troy haven’t had a chance to face Stanford yet this season. Stanford is undefeated so far this season with seven sweeps out of its 13 wins, and only three teams (Rice, Saint Mary’s and California) have managed to put more than one on the board against the Cardinal.
If the Women of Troy are to repeat as Pac-12 champions, the team needs to have success on the road this weekend. UCLA will also be traveling to the Bay Area, visiting Stanford today and Cal tomorrow. All four teams are undefeated in conference play so far, so this weekend’s results will provide some separation at the top of the conference rankings.
USC’s match against California kicks off today at 1:30 p.m. in Berkeley, Calif. Saturday’s match against Stanford will begin at noon in Palo Alto, Calif.

We’ve reached that point of the year, folks. In the words of legendary Dodgers’ broadcaster Vin Scully, “It’s time for Dodger Baseball.”
The boys in blue are indeed back on the diamond and off to a hot 4-1 start, but the majority of Southern California residents, including Scully, can’t even watch manager Don Mattingly put his $235 million team out on the field.
The reason for this is that SportsNet LA, the Dodgers’ new network which launched on Feb. 25, is only available to those who have Time Warner Cable.
So for those of you with DirecTV, Dish, Cox, etc. (two-thirds of Los Angeles residents), you’re out of luck for the time being until the parties are able to come to an agreement. And who knows how long that’s going to take?
The cable providers remain in a stalemate, as the distributors think that Time Warner is charging too much ($4-$5 per household), while Time Warner thinks it’s asking for a fair price.
Consequently, when the Dodgers take the field for opening day at Dodger Stadium on Friday against its rival, the San Francisco Giants, I’m not going to be able to take in balls and strikes, see the umpires conduct reviews or, maybe most tragically, listen to Scully’s legendary voice in what may very well be his last season with the Dodgers.
Eighty-six-year-old Scully, who reportedly has DirecTV, is not even able to watch the Dodgers from the comfort of his living room when he is not broadcasting the games.
The star-studded team that has been funded by minority owner Magic Johnson and company is coming into the 2014 season as World Series favorites, but there’s really no point to spending this great deal of money on a team when the majority of fans can’t even watch them play.
About 70 percent of the L.A. market is unable to watch the Dodgers on television, which obviously explains the low ratings the team is experiencing so far this season. And for DirecTV subscribers, things aren’t looking too good, as the two sides have halted talks on carrying the channel.
Things are getting ugly and phones are ringing off the hook as desperate L.A. fans simply want their Dodgers.
I’m pretty sure that if you asked a thousand fans if they would rather have their team boast the largest payroll in the MLB or be able to watch their beloved Dodgers, they would take being able to watch the games 99 percent of the time.
Spending money is only worth it if people are going to enjoy it, and unless one is at the ballpark, they are no longer going to be afforded that luxury.
This dilemma, however, is just another example of business getting in the way of sports.
When the Pac-12 Networks launched more than a year and a half ago, USC students and fans alike griped at the fact that the network couldn’t reach a deal with DirecTV, leaving many people unable to watch conference matchups at home.
Similarly to the Pac-12, the Dodgers would not have gone through with the inception of this new network had it not been for a purpose: playing money ball. And no, I’m not talking about the movie featuring former Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane and his use of sabermetrics and the “Bill James Theorem.”
At the end of the day, the sport of baseball, which has no salary cap unlike the rest of the major professional sports, is all about the money.
If you have money like the Dodgers do, you spend it, and if you don’t, well then it sucks.
After all, how do you think the organization is going to pay pitcher Clayton Kershaw $215 million over seven years and still finance the other players on the league’s most expensive roster?
The Dodgers’ deal with Time Warner is worth around $8 billion over 25 years, and the deal itself has played an important role in allowing the team to become contenders once again.
L.A. sports fans are not new to these types of television deals, as the Lakers went through the same process when they released their own regional sports network, Time Warner Cable SportsNet.
About a year and a half ago, I wrote a piece for the San Clemente Times titled “Where are the Lakers?” to address the great frustration that fans were feeling because they were unable to watch their team play on the hardwood.
Looking back now, that Lakers team also had a lot of hype surrounding it, with its newly acquired superstars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard. It’s painful to bring it up because we all know how that turned out.
I’m not saying there is a correlation between the two, though it just may be dèja vù or the “curse of the regional sports network,” but for the Dodgers’ sake, I really hope for what happened to the Lakers.
All of this TV network commotion makes me feel nostalgic in a sense. Remember when the games were “free,” and we didn’t have to worry about paying extra every month so we could see our favorite teams play?
Regional sports networks are capitalist interests outweighing the need to please the fanbase, and everyone needs to realize this all comprises the arms race that will continue to dictate the sports universe.
For now, though, Dodger fans across the Southland will just have to sit tight. Hopefully, we all will be hearing Scully’s stories amidst a Yasiel Puig at bat in a matter of no time.

Following a successful start to Pac-12 play, USC’s men’s tennis team will take on conference foes Stanford and California at Marks Stadium this weekend, marking the Trojans’ third and fourth Pac-12 matches of the season.
Comeback kid · Junior Roberto Quiroz fought his way back into the national rankings this season after 10 consecutive singles victories. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (20-2, 2-0) have won 11 consecutive matches, and look to continue their streak against the No. 52 Cardinal (9-2, 2-0) and the No. 18 Bears (12-3, 2-0).
After a brief stint atop the national rankings, the Trojans enter this weekend’s conference matchups at No. 2 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s national team rankings.
Senior captain Ray Sarmiento leads USC in individual rankings with the No. 3 spot in the nation, a career high for the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native.
Following in Sarmiento’s footsteps are No. 12-ranked junior Yannick Hanfmann, No. 44-ranked junior Jonny Wang, No. 56-ranked junior Roberto Quiroz and No. 100-ranked sophomore Max de Vroome. Hanfmann is ranked 12th in the country, while Wang, Quiroz and de Vroome are ranked 44th, 56th and 100th, respectively.
Sarmiento and Hanfmann have climbed up to the No. 5 spot in the doubles rankings together, while senior Michael Grant and freshman Nick Crystal are ranked No. 60.
Crystal has been partnering up with Quiroz lately, and the duo has yet to lose a match.
The two were instrumental in USC’s success last weekend, a road trip during which they took home 6-1 wins against Oregon and Washington. The Trojans insist that they will keep their competitive juices flowing against the Cardinal and the Bears.
“We try to prepare mentally for each match the same way and make sure we are 100 percent ready to go every match,” Sarmiento said.
Stanford, California and USC are all 2-0 in Pac-12 play, with the Cardinal and Golden Bears both racking up wins over Utah and Arizona last week.
Stanford boasts the No. 55-ranked singles player in the nation in Maciek Romanowicz, but has no ranked doubles teams. Cal, on the other hand, has two ranked singles players in No. 70 Ben McLachlan and No. 89 Campbell Johnson. The Bears also can claim two ranked doubles teams: Gregory Bayane and Chase Melton are ranked No. 14 and McLachlan and Andre Goransson are ranked No. 67.
“Right now, Cal is better because of the [rankings] but Stanford has [its] history and we can’t underestimate [that],” junior Roberto Quiroz said.
Indeed, the Cardinal have won 17 national championships in men’s tennis, just behind the Trojans, who have earned 20 national titles — the most of any team in the country. Stanford is also the only men’s tennis team other than USC to have won the national championship four years in a row.
Though Stanford has fallen out of the national spotlight recently, the Trojans still treat each matchup with respect and look at each as a learning opportunity.
“Going into this weekend, we just want to keep getting better as a team and make sure we continue to do our jobs individually,” Sarmiento said. “These are just matches that [give] us an opportunity to keep our momentum and move forward.”
Moving forward will be important for Sarmiento, who lost both of his singles matches last weekend — his first back-to-back losses of the season.
The losses brought Sarmiento’s total record to 18-7 overall on the season, and 10-2 in dual match play. Quiroz, along with de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson, has reached the 20-win club in singles play this season, with Johnson and de Vroome each earning 21 wins. Quiroz has also strung together an impressive 10-match winning streak in singles.
This year, the team is trying to rise above and beyond in the Pac-12 conference.
“The goal is to give [ourselves] a chance to win the NCAA [Tournament],” Quiroz said. “And yes, I see the team very [focused] on our goals.”
The Trojans face the Cardinal today at 1:30 p.m. and the Bears on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. in Marks Stadium.

After a lackluster practice on Tuesday, the USC football team rebounded nicely for a strong session on Thursday. USC head coach Steve Sarkisian was again impressed by his players’ ability to respond to the coaching staff’s criticism.
Valuable asset · USC redshirt senior defensive back Josh Shaw has sat out of most of the spring with injury. Shaw, a transfer from Florida, has recorded 119 tackles and 6 interceptions in his time at both schools. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“We looked at the film from Tuesday, which I thought [showed that] we were a little bit sloppy and a little bit slow, and we came back today and finished practice eight to nine minutes faster than Tuesday, and the tempo was where we wanted it,” Sarkisian said. “There were less unforced errors. You’re gonna have some days where you don’t do it exactly how you want to. The important thing, though, is, ‘Are we gonna respond?’ And I thought our guys really responded today.”
Thursday’s practice was the eighth of 15 for the team, marking the midpoint of spring practice. Sarkisian was pleased with the progress his players have made in the past few weeks.
“We feel very good about where we’re at,” Sarkisian said. “Some of the mistakes that we were making early, we’re not making those same mistakes now. We’re not perfect by any means, but we’re getting an idea of who we are as a team and where our strengths are, and we’re trying to play to those strengths on both sides of the ball.”
SECONDARY STRIDES
 
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens, who started 13 games last season and finished tied for second on the team with four interceptions, missed practice for the second time this week while dealing with a knee injury. He joined redshirt senior defensive back Josh Shaw and redshirt sophomore cornerback Devian Shelton on the list of injured defensive backs.
 
These injuries have provided many opportunities for younger, inexperienced players to get more playing time. Freshman cornerback Chris Hawkins was able to take most of his reps with the first unit.
“It’s all new for him,” said defensive backs coach Keith Heyward. “We’re new coaches, with a new scheme, new techniques and new things they’ve got to learn. [Hawkins] hasn’t played [in games yet], so he has to get used to the speed of the game. But he’s doing a good job.”
Last season, former defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast served the dual role of defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach, which often left him little time for the little things. Heyward’s approach is much more detail-oriented.
“Coach Heyward is a great coach. He takes the time out to really teach you,” Hawkins said. “He goes from corner to free safety to strong safety and to the other corner. He doesn’t skip over anybody.”
Yet with no game experience under his belt, Hawkins, who just turned 19 in March, has leaned on veterans such as Shaw and junior cornerback Kevon Seymour to help guide him as he adjusts to his new role on defense.
“Kevon and Josh both help me a lot,” Hawkins said. “I’m the young one in the group, so they help me a lot. Knowing that they’ve been in the game and knowing what receivers are trying to do to them, they help me physically and mentally.”
QUICK HITS
 
Sarkisian said that he hopes to get as many players back during spring as he can, but his ultimate goal is to have everyone healthy by the time fall camp begins.
“When we go to training camp, I want a 100 percent healthy football team, and I don’t want to risk that in spring,” Sarkisian said. “With that being said, we’re fighting like crazy to get these guys back on the field because we’re a better team the more guys we have out there.”
Sarkisian expects to have Cravens and redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen back before spring practice ends.
Midway through practice, Sarkisian called the team together for a competition period, a normal part of practice that pits a handful of offensive and defensive players against each other in what is normally a strength or speed drill.
This time, however, the “competition” was a dance-off, as players showed off their moves while the speakers blared hip-hop music.
“We have a competition period where we do a lot of one-on-ones,” Sarkisian said. “I just felt that the time was right to shake that period up a little bit. It was a good competition. Some guys have some moves, and some guys don’t.”
Rogers and redshirt sophomore linebacker Scott Starr were singled out as the best dancers on the team.
USC’s next practice will be on Saturday at Howard Jones Field. After practice, the players will participate in the Swim With Mike charity event, which helps physically challenged athletes.
“It’s a great event, and it’s an opportunity for players to understand their role here,” Sarkisian said. “They’re not just guys who put on helmets and shoulder pads. They’re student-athletes that do a service to the university. It’s their opportunity to give back, and they’ll do a good job.”

In a last-ditch effort to save the struggling Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, it was announced through Israeli media Tuesday that former United States Navy intelligence analyst and convicted spy Jonathan Pollard could be released in upcoming weeks as an incentive to extend the negotiations into 2015, according to CNN. Though many who oppose Pollard’s release cite the internal strife it could potentially cause within the American intelligence community, the real issue that must be addressed is that Pollard’s release would ultimately fail to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations — the only reason his release is being proposed in the first place.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
Thirty years ago, Pollard, a former civilian analyst within the U.S. navy intelligence community, was sentenced to life in prison after he plead guilty to violating the Espionage Act. Convinced that the United States was keeping important information from one of its strongest allies, Pollard passed on top-secret documents to Israel in return for tens of thousands of dollars. Though the Israeli government originally denied any connection to Pollard, his release has since become the focus of many Israeli politicians. Those in support of Pollard say that his sentence was unusually harsh and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be willing to grant more concessions, such as releasing Palestinian prisoners and halting the ever-expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, if Pollard were freed.
But it won’t. Though Pollard’s release would be a temporary political victory for Netanyahu and members of his coalition, it would do nothing to change the political realities that have made Israeli-Palestinian negotiations so trying. Even if Pollard was returned tomorrow, the same politicians thrilled by his release would remain just as uncompromising in their stance toward settlement expansion, borders and the release of Palestinian prisoners as they were before Pollard’s release.
This isn’t the first time that Pollard has been proposed as a gesture of goodwill as a means of reviving Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. In 1998, the same suggestion was made when then-President Bill Clinton weighed with the idea of releasing Pollard at a time when peace negotiations were at a similar standstill. In response, then-CIA Director George Tenet threatened to quit his post. In the end, President Clinton chose not to release Pollard — just as President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry should now.
Negotiations require compromise, but Pollard’s release makes no promise of concessions on the issues that have made this seemingly impossible conflict what it is today. As Jeffery Goldberg so aptly put it in an editorial for Bloomberg View, “The right-wing of the Netanyahu coalition, and the right-most members of the prime minister’s own Likud Party, would like very much welcome Pollard at Ben Gurion International Airport, but they will not trade land for him, not one inch.”
The issues facing Sec. Kerry and his negotiating team are not easy. From Israeli hesitation to release Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands to Palestinian frustration with continuous settlement construction, it is understandable that they would try to grasp at straws in an attempt to avoid a collapse in negotiations set to expire on April 29. But if releasing Pollard is what they consider their best bet at keeping both parties at the negotiation table, perhaps it’s time they got a sharper negotiating team.

A high-profile espionage case, recently brought out from under the dust of three decades, has reignited a stack of controversial dynamite. Seeking an incentive for Israel to continue its peace negotiations with Palestine, the United States is considering releasing convicted spy Jonathan Pollard. Though the move would please many in Israel as well as pro-Israeli lawmakers in Congress, it isn’t a risk worth taking if true peace — at home, especially — is to be valued.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
A Jewish American who had made it his dream to aid Israel from an early age, Pollard worked with U.S. naval intelligence between 1979 and 1985. This dream took on reality when Pollard met an Israeli fighter pilot, Col. Aviem Sella, according to the Christian Science Monitor. Pollard agreed to spy, starting out by passing secrets related to artillery developments in several Arab countries and later taking on volumes of more classified material. Until his arrest in November of 1985, Pollard had a bi-weekly schedule of deliveries that contained more than five suitcases of classified information at a time. He pleaded guilty to leaking documents and was given a life sentence in 1987.
Though supporters of his release argue that he only wanted to help an ally of the United States and that he has already paid enough in his past 27 years in federal prison, the reasons behind an early release don’t stand up to the standards to which we as Americans should hold ourselves.
By releasing Pollard under an entanglement of geopolitical reasons, the need to stand by the law is undermined — a dangerous move that will put the reliability of a government into question. From the outside, it would seem like the government has problems executing justice if it can’t enforce criminal sentences without being swayed by political matters.
The U.S. government is debating Pollard’s possible release in hopes of salvaging the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, according to CNN. The impasse lies over whether Israel will honor its promise to release more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners, including 14 Arab Israelis whom Israel has labeled terrorists. The initial schedule for release was March 29, but because of the delay, the Palestinians have threatened to end the talks, pursuing recognition at the United Nations instead.
There is no reason to release Pollard now at the risk of an internal battle at home. Ironically, to try to buy the continuation of peace talks with Pollard, the United States might very well disrupt peace at home, starting within our intelligence community.
Since Pollard’s arrest in 1987, he has maintained that he only gave information to Israel so it could protect itself from hostile Middle Eastern nations. Former Director of Naval Intelligence Adm. Thomas Brooks, however, thinks otherwise.
“Much of what he took, contrary to what he’d have you believe, had nothing to do with Arab countries or the security of Israel, but had everything to do with U.S. collection methods, to include most specifically against the Soviet Union,” Brooks told Foreign Policy. “I think what he did is exceeded only by Edward Snowden.”
What’s more, this isn’t the first time Pollard’s release has been used as a bargain chip. Former President Bill Clinton was prepared to release Pollard during the summit at Wye River, Md. in 1998 before intelligence agencies, most notably CIA Director George Tenet, spoke against it.
Peace at home should be given higher priority than matters overseas, and it seems like the intelligence community should be the best place to consult on whether or not he should be released, especially under such political circumstances. World peace starts at home.

Isreal is obviously not negotiatiog in good faith.  They have been destoying what’s left of a potential palestinian, just look at the maps over time.  Just now they are kicking palestinians out of their homes and building illegal settlements.. I could go on and on with this but everyone knows this even israel apologists.
With friends like Israel, who needs enemies?
Me. Yu, you confidently and incorrectly stated the US government is “Seeking an incentive for Israel to continue its peace negotiations with Palestine.” The statement clearly implies Israel is an unwilling peace partner when there is no question that Abbas has merely used the good faith prisoner release agreement as a delay tactic.
Only yesterday, April 3, Abbas issued a new list of demands to the Americans and Israelis to continue beyond the April end date.
