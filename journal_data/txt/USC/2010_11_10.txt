The USC men’s golf team closed out its fall season Wednesday with a disappointing third round at the Gifford Collegiate Championship in San Martin, Calif.

Despite finding success during their second round of play and putting themselves in a position to battle for the top spot, the Trojan’s third-round play dropped them from third place into fourth. The difficult tournament course, CordeValle Golf Club, and high winds in the first and third rounds worked against the Trojans.
The team hit for a collective 39-over-par 1104 (378, 351, 375) to tie for fourth place. This score left them five strokes back from Northwestern, 17 strokes back from Stanford and 30 strokes back from the tournament champion UCLA. Also competing were Washington, Oregon, San Diego, Oklahoma, Arizona, Lamar, Long Beach State and Augusta State.
The top individual golfer for the Trojans was sophomore Martin Trainer, who tied for a career-best seventh place. He was the team’s only top-10 finisher of the tournament. Trainer hit for a one-over-par 72 in the third round, giving him a final score of two-over-par 215 (73, 70, 72). Trainer played well, matching bogeys with birdies (three of each) until his final hole, which he bogeyed to go one stroke above par.
Trainer said he was thrilled with his performance.
“I’m very happy about my finish. I really needed some evidence that I was making steps in the right direction and I think this is it,” Trainer said.
Next for the Trojans was freshman Ramsey Sahyoun, who finished in a tie for 18th place — also a career best. This was his second appearance for the Trojans. Sahyoun hit a one-over-par 72 in the third round, which left him at a seven-over-par 220 (79, 69, 72) on the tournament. In his final round, Sahyoun hit a double bogey, five bogeys and six birdies.
Sophomore T.J Vogel finished third for the Trojans, posting a four-over-par 75 on the final day to finish in a tie for 20th place with a eight-over-par 221 on the tournament (75, 71, 75). Vogel hit a double bogey, four bogeys and two birdies Wednesday, a performance that dropped him from 13th place to 20th.
Fourth for the Trojans was junior Steve Lim, who tied for 26th place. Lim finished with a 10-over-par 223 (72, 72, 79) following the first two rounds where he hit an impressive one-over-par 72. Lim had a disappointing eight-over-par 79 in the third to fall from ninth to 26th place. Lim hit a double bogey, nine bogeys and three birdies in his final round.
Freshman Jeffrey Kang finished fifth for the team, with a 12-over-par 225 (79, 69, 77) that put him in a tie for 38th place. Despite a promising second round, Kang hit seven bogeys and just one birdie in his third round for a six-over-par 77.
The final member of the Trojan squad was senior Bo DeHuff, who finished the tournament with a 24-over-par 237 (79, 78, 80) for 71st place. In his final round, DeHuff hit three double bogeys, five bogeys and two birdies for a nine-over-par 80.
The tournament concluded the fall season for the USC men’s golf team. Despite a disappointing fall season, the team remains optimistic for the months to come.
“We struggled a little bit. We still have a young team and we don’t have five guys who can consistently play well yet, but I think that will develop over the few months,” Trainer said. “I can guarantee that this team is going to be really strong by the end of the year when the national championships come around.”
The Trojans’ next tournament is the Mauna Lani Invitational in Kohala Coast, Hawaii, which will begin Feb. 2.

The No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (20-2, 4-2) will dive into the McDonald’s Swim Stadium pool for the last time this season tonight in a 5 p.m. conference match against No. 10 Pepperdine (9-12, 1-5).
Although the game is a conference matchup, seeding will not be at stake as the Trojans’ earlier 13-4 win against the Waves was already counted toward the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings. Cal has, for all intents and purposes, sewn up the No. 1 seed with an undefeated MPSF record and a win over USC, but the No. 2 seed is still up for grabs as Stanford only has a one-game lead over the Trojans, who are currently entrenched in third place.
In order to make such a move a possibility, however, the Trojans must first sweep their remaining MPSF games after Pepperdine.
Aiming for the top - Sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal hopes the Trojans haven’t peaked yet as they play their last home game of the season today and get ready for the MPSF and NCAA playoffs. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“Seeding is very important to us, but I don’t think we have a realistic chance to be No. 1,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Berkeley would have to lose three games for us to be in front of them, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. There’s a possibility to be No. 2, but that’s out of our control.”
What this game will count toward, as always, is NCAA rankings. Despite sporting a sub-.500 winning percentage, the Waves are still ranked in the top-10 team — a commentary on the relative strength of the MPSF compared to other NCAA water polo conferences.
Vavic identified the Waves’ outside shooters as a key area of focus for his team, as the Trojans will try to contain an offense that has averaged 9.52 goals per game.
“They’re pretty strong on the outside shooting with (Nate) Castillo and Danny White,” Vavic said. “We have to be careful about the matchups to make sure that we don’t give up easy shots from some of their really good outside shooters.”
Pepperdine sophomores James Perry and Spencer Hamby will also test the Trojans’ strength in the two-meters, as they, along with Castillo and White, are offensive leaders for the Waves.
Coming off perhaps their most impressive and emotional win of the season, the Trojans cannot afford any letdowns for the rest of the season. They are peaking at an opportune time, but must sustain a high level of play.
“The win against UCLA was huge, but in the big picture, it’s just one more step toward our ultimate goal,” redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal said. “We’re still trying to get better, obviously. I hope we haven’t peaked yet because we have to be at our best to succeed in the postseason.”
Not to be forgotten amid the playoff discussion is that today will be the last opportunity for USC students to see their Trojans play live, as the MPSF and NCAA championships will be hosted by Stanford and Cal, respectively.
As for why fans should come out to cheer on the Trojans today, Rosenthal provided several reasons.
“For UCLA we had a crazy crowd and it really fired us up,” he said. “It’s our last home game of the year, we’ve won back-to-back national championships and it’ll be worth watching. It’s our seniors’ last home game and it would be awesome to send them off well.”

As the room lights dimmed and the spotlight shined upon the stage, the eager murmuring of the audience came to a halt as all eyes focused on the artists.
Come together · Poets, singers, spoken word artists or dancers from USC and the surrounding area come together in The Nook, a new series of open mic nights aimed at promoting interconnectivity. - Photo courtesy of The Nook 
Through the words of the poets, the lyrics of the singers and the movement of the dancers, every member of the audience is brought into an exhilarating spiritual journey of contemplation, self-reflection and inspiration. It’s The Nook Open Mic Night.
This Friday, The Nook will host its second Open Mic Night at the Mercado La Paloma, located just a few blocks from campus on Grand and 37th streets.
The Nook, started in September by several USC students, seeks to foster a sense of community for both campus and community members alike that allows everyone to express his or her values through art performances and storytelling in a safe environment.
The idea behind the event came about after the success of a similar open mic event held last semester, “Our City Our Stories.” Working with community member Damon Turner, who runs his own open mic event, “Freedom Friday,” at the Mercado La Paloma, each open mic night brings together a new set of stories, ideas and creative thought, which is carefully and cleverly woven together and displayed through song, dance and the spoken word.
But it’s not just a chance to showcase art, as the event’s content also addresses cultural issues such as gender, sexuality, race and social change.
“By providing an open space where both participants and audience members engage in these issues through art and expression, we’re trying to cultivate a culture that embraces new or unfamiliar ideas,” said Meagan Chin, a sophomore majoring in fine arts and one of the founding members of The Nook.
Although it might sound like The Nook is just another student organization on campus advocating a particular cause, it’s far from that. With a desire for collaboration in mind, The Nook has brought together a variety of students who work with different organizations on campus in the hopes of creating a strong example of artistic diversity.
“What we really want to do is to unite everyone,” said Johnnie Jung, a freshman majoring in business administration and mechanical engineering who works with The Nook. “We want to establish an event that is open to different people, different groups and really, just anyone who wants to be part of something amazing.
The main motivation behind The Nook is the idea of intimately connecting USC students and the neighborhood surrounding campus.
“Even though USC is in Downtown L.A., the contrast between USC students and its surrounding community could not be more contrasting,” Chin said. “We want to unite everyone together through a common experience.”
Jung echoed that sentiment, stressing the importance of being involved with the surrounding community.
“It’s so unique to work with community members and people not associated with USC in any way. I think that this area around USC is a great laboratory for social work and ideas,” he said. “[The Nook] is vested in the idea of coalition building and forming bonds and relationships that will bring together different groups and people. Really, we want to address communal issues in an interesting and engaging way.”
Because the environment of The Nook’s open mic nights is so intimate, the performers on stage are often inspired audience members. As the night progressed in the last meeting, the performances became more dramatic, with the emotional content of each growing more intense and the stories more personal.
“Storytelling is something we can all do — and it is something we can all relate to,” Jung said. “It is very uplifting to see people, who hadn’t prepared anything, step on stage and speak their mind. It takes a lot of courage to do so and it’s very heartwarming to know that we have such a safe environment for people to do so.”
The connection between the performers and audience is key, organizers said.
“We really want to bridge the gap between the community and the campus,” Jung said. “We really do have something special here — the unique opportunity to bring people together. It’s just awesome.”

There’s no doubt about it: Last season was the worst season for USC football since the year Pete Carroll took over in 2001. The Trojans went 9-4, lost to lowly Washington, got blown out at Oregon on Halloween, humiliated at home on homecoming against Stanford and fell to Arizona on the last day of the regular season.
It’s a stretch · Senior fullback Stanley Havili and the Trojans have yet to beat a team they lost to last year, including Arizona, whom USC plays this week. Saturday will be USC’s last chance to avenge a loss from last year. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
A lot has changed since then. There’s a new head coach, a new athletic director, a new star receiver and, as we’ve seen throughout the year, a whole new secondary.
The one thing that hasn’t changed is the results. The Trojans still lost to Washington and Stanford this year — albeit in games that were so close the score might have changed if only Willow Smith showed up to whip her hair back and forth — and lost by 21 to Oregon at home.
Which is why, if the Trojans want to prove that this season is different than last year’s and that the program is on the rise and better off with all these changes, they need to beat Arizona on Saturday. This is USC’s last chance to make a statement this year. Arizona is the last team the Trojans face whom they lost to last year and the last ranked team they play this year. Not to mention the game on Saturday is on the road.
USC came into this season with high hopes. Sure, the NCAA handed down sanctions that were harsher than a black cherry Warhead. But there was talk of the team sticking it to the man and going 13-0, 12-1 or at least 11-2. The Pac-10 title seemed within reach.
Then the season started.
Even though USC started 4-0, it was clear this team was going to have trouble staying undefeated the rest of the season. Just as it was beginning to show last year, the defense, which had been USC’s hard-hitting, no nonsense, fearsome staple for the past decade, hasn’t been its former self this year. Trojan defenses just don’t give up 53 points in a game and let the opposing team march down the field for game-winning field goals — twice.
The Trojans have had chances to make statements this season. They faced Washington, who beat USC last year with the former USC coaching staff, but the Trojans couldn’t prove that last year was a fluke.
Then they faced Stanford on the road and couldn’t pull out the victory that would’ve vaulted them back into the Pac-10 title picture. Then came Oregon, and on national TV, USC finally seemed to show signs of its former self. For three quarters, it looked like the Trojans had recovered from the NCAA’s knockout blow. But the fourth quarter hit, and USC stumbled around before crashing hard and staying down for the count.
That’s not to say this team hasn’t changed for the better. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley is fourth in the nation with 24 touchdown passes and has matured into arguably one of the best quarterbacks in college football. USC coach Lane Kiffin has taken over the program and ensured that the team keeps fighting and competing even though the stakes are naught.
If USC loses to Arizona but rallies to beat Oregon State, Notre Dame and UCLA, nobody will turn their heads. USC is supposed to beat those teams, even though a matchup with the Beavers will be played in Corvallis, Ore. Finishing 9-4 would be nice and would be on par with the team’s record last year. But the program needs to move forward, and 10-3 and a top-20 ranking looks a heck of a lot better than 9-4.
Some fans will say that as long as USC beats Notre Dame and UCLA, the season would be salvageable.
Those are the few loyal fans. As we’ve seen this year, when USC doesn’t play well, fans drop off by the thousands. The reported attendance for Saturday’s game against Arizona State was just less than 69,000, but I’d say it was closer to 60,000. It’s sad that the Coliseum isn’t full week in and week out like stadiums for 6-3 teams in the SEC or Big Ten country, but if the Trojans can get this statement win against Arizona, it will increase the hype for next year and maybe the Coliseum will come alive like it did a few weeks ago against Oregon.
And who knows, USC might even be able to play for the national championship next season, so the higher the Trojans can be ranked at the beginning of the year, the better the chances of that happening.
In a sense, next year starts now.
However, it all comes down to this: If USC still wants teams to fear those three letters, the Trojans need to show that they are better than last year’s team, which hasn’t been the case thus far. They need to prove that even with the sanctions, which have undoubtedly hampered the team, they can beat good squads. They need to prove the spirit that USC is not in a state of decline.
The way they can do that is by beating a ranked team on the road — one they lost to last year. There’s no doubt the team will fight on, but this is the last chance to hold up the two fingers for victory in front of the nation.

USC libraries debuted their new Holocaust and Genocide Studies collection this week — a large, multi-disciplinary archive featuring rare books, original Nazi pamphlets, diaries, eyewitness testimonies and a variety of other resources.
“The unique thing about the collection is that it’s an interdisciplinary collection,” said Lynn Sipe, director of collection resources for USC’s Information Services Division and one of the collection’s facilitators. “It’s interdisciplinary in the sense that its not only history, but it’s also philosophy, religion, a little bit of art, medicine, psychology and a lot of literature and fiction — all dealing with the Holocaust.”
Sipe and the collection’s co-facilitator, history and Jewish studies professor Wolf Gruner, bought the 8,000-item collection from a book dealer in the San Fernando Valley more than two years ago. The purchase was funded by the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and USC Libraries.
“When we bought a collection as big as this, we had nowhere to put it that it would be readily accessible,” Sipe said. “We wanted it to be available to students to use as easily as possible.”
The new collection has been given a special room in the basement of Doheney Memorial Library.
What sat in that room on the floor nine months ago, stored in more than 300 boxes, is now shelved, catalogued and ready for students to use.
The collection is open to anyone with a USC student ID, and can be accessed anytime the library is open by picking up at key at Doheney’s main desk.
“It contains a variety of subjects which are of interest for a research paper,” Gruner said. “Children, resistance, churches, ghettos — almost every aspect of the Holocaust.”
In addition to covering a wide range of topics and disciplines, the collection includes resources written in a multitude of languages, such as English, German, Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew.
Another important reason for creating the collection, Gruner said, was laying a foundation for establishing a Holocaust and genocide studies program at USC.
Though the collection officially made its debut just this week with an open house for library employees to become more familiar with the collection, Gruner and Sipe are still looking to build the collection.
“The next step to enrich our collection, and my aim is to attract, for example, survivors’ families to donate private papers that can complement the Nazi documents we have in there and provide more materials from the perspective of the victims,” Gruner said.
Gruner and Sipe have also organized a Visions and Voices event next semester, featuring performances and conversation inspired by materials from the collection.
The event will take place on April 14 and will include a performance of a play created by two USC faculty artists and a panel discussion about the use of testimony and trauma for creative expression.
Correction: A previous version of this article identified Lynn Sipe as the director of collection resources for USC’s Information Services Division. He is the associate dean for Collections for USC Libraries. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The final stretch of USC’s season begins with perhaps the team’s toughest remaining test when the Trojans travel to face No. 18 Arizona on Saturday.
The Wildcats, despite coming off a lopsided loss to Stanford last week, will challenge the Trojans on both sides of the ball.
Quarterback Nick Foles is the Pac-10’s most efficient passer at 71.8 percent, almost 10 percent higher than second-place Steven Threet from Arizona State. The Wildcats rely on a short, quick passing game at a pace that is only surpassed by Oregon.
Arizona’s defense is no slouch either. Opposing offenses average 17.4 points against the Wildcats. The Trojans are averaging 36.4 yards a game this season, good for third behind Oregon and Stanford.
Foles’ primary target is 6-foot-4, 210-pound wide receiver Juron Criner. With 58 catches for 884 yards, Criner is leading  the conference in receptions, making Foles and Criner arguably the best tandem in the Pac-10.
The Trojans know that any hopes of slowing down Arizona begin by stopping its passing attack.
Senior USC cornerback Shareece Wright said the key is to play with confidence against Arizona’s talented receiving corps, which also includes David Douglas and David Roberts.
“They’re a good group of receivers,” Wright said. “Probably the best that we’re going to see all year so you have to play with a lot of confidence and stay on top.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin spoke about Criner’s skill in practice on Wednesday.
“He’s just special with the ball in his hands,” Kiffin said. “He’s just one of those unique guys.”
Criner caught the game-winning touchdown against the Trojans in the Coliseum last year. During the game, former USC defensive back Josh Pinkard tore his ACL for the third time, which left Pinkard sitting on the couch come draft time.
“Personally, for Josh, I’m going to make sure that [Criner doesn’t score the game-winning touchdown] again this year,” Wright said. “I’ll make sure I do my best to defend that guy.”
On the other side of the ball, not only does Arizona lead the conference in scoring defense but it is also top in defending the run. The Wildcats yield just 2.9 yards per carry and 102.7 yards per game, not to mention they have only allowed eight rushing touchdowns in nine games.
“We just have to be physical,” redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler said. “Their defensive line pretty much anchors their defense and we’ve got to get those guys out the way.”

Kiffin said as of Wednesday he did not yet know who would start at running back against Arizona.
Freshman Dillon Baxter made his first career start against Arizona State last week, but when asked if Baxter would start Saturday, Kiffin said he didn’t know.
It will likely depend on Tyler’s health. Tyler was helped off the field near the end of the Arizona State game after suffering a sprained ankle.
Tyler’s practice activity remained limited on Wednesday, after not practicing Tuesday. The junior said he is not quite at full strength, but the ankle is not bothering him.
As for tailback Allen Bradford’s role in the rotation, Kiffin said the senior has to take care of his injuries and also hold onto the ball before he works his way back in.
“It’s the most important thing we talk about and do here, is take care of the ball,” Kiffin said.
—
Sophomore safety Jawanza Starling and redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Matt Kalil did not practice on Wednesday. Along with Tyler, freshman wide receiver Robert Woods was limited but his status was improving.
“This is the best Robert’s looked this week,” Kiffin said.
Kiffin said there is an obvious dropoff when either Woods or senior receiver Ronald Johnson are less than 100 percent.
“It’s imperative to have [Woods] in our offense, to have the two speed guys out there,” Kiffin said.

Though USC’s only intramural field next to Heritage Hall will be replaced to make room for the newly announced athletic facility, officials say they do not have any finalized plans for relocating teams and students during construction.
A new intramural field will be constructed where the Music Practice and Instructional Center is now located, according to Arvin Varma, associate director of facilities and recreational sports.
The construction of the athletic center — a $70-million, 110,000-square-foot facility — is estimated to take 18 months to complete, with construction beginning in January.
During construction, USC intramural teams will share other fields for practice and games.
“We’re working with athletics to be able to use the Brian Kennedy Field which is next to Howard Jones [Field] and also get some time on McAlister Field,” Varma said.
PIC already closed last month and the intramural field will also close as the season comes to an end.
“Right now it’s probably going to close the first week in December … It might close right after Thanksgiving,” Varma said. “Whatever make-up games we have to do, we will do on the other fields like McAlister, Cromwell and Brian Kennedy.”
Although news of the construction was announced on Oct. 30, the idea for the project has been a long time coming.
“It’s been on the table for a good amount of time,” Varma said. “Athletics has been talking about it for a while. It’s something they’ve talked about for a few years and they looked at the [intramural field] and that was the space they suggested.”
There was much hesitation, however, about the new athletic facility because of questions about where a new intramural field would be located.
“We were definitely concerned because initially there wasn’t a plan to put in a field. Now with the new design and the field space that we will get, it will actually be, in square footage, a little bit bigger than what we currently have,” Varma said.
Another advantage of the new field is that it will be turfed, Varma said. This eliminates the need to shut the field down multiple times a year for weeks at a time to re-sod it.
Nicole Martin, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said though she is not looking forward to the construction, the end result will worth it.
“I’d rather not have it shut down for 18 months, but turf fields are going to be nicer to play on,” Martin said. “I just prefer turf in general and it will be easier to maintain so it won’t get shut down to get redone.”
There is still some concern, Martin said, about whether intramural sports will get the field time needed in the coming months.
“They should have [a new] field first before they decide to construct a new building before they shut it down so that intramurals can still be strongly supported at USC,” Martin said. “I think it’s going to be very complicated to jump around fields and that there is a large potential for a lack of field availability for intramural sports because they’re not club sports or an official sport.”
Details about field scheduling and the official closing of the intramural field should be finalized within a week, Varma said.
Though a lack of intramural space has been a concern for many students over the years, they might soon find some additional relief. During a discussion with students on Tuesday as part of the Campus Conversation Series, USC President C.L. Max Nikias said although plans had not yet been finalized, university officials were looking into adding an additional intramural field to the University Village after it is redeveloped.
Correction: A previous version of this article said the athletic complex would cost $70,000. The real cost is estimated to be $70 million. An infographic that previously ran with the story was also incorrect, but has been removed. The Daily Trojan apologizes for the errors.
“an info graphic was incorrect, but was removed”
???
You mean that USC doesn’t plan to demolish PED?
Could you please be less ambiguous at how badly
your paper actually is reporting the news. A little bit
of clarification would be nice.
If I am correct, the field is moving adjacent to where it is now (directly south)
So yes the picture is definatley wrong
Haha, illustration fail.
Your map appears to have been constructed by someone with no comprehension of the campus’s layout. PIC is located at what you have labeled SSM (which does not exist), and I don’t believe that there are any plans to bulldoze PED.
Also, I believe that a new building of any sort would cost several orders of magnitude more than $70,000.
the picture is wrong. ped is not where the new field will be.

In a world where communication is confined to 140-character blurbs, a group at USC has challenged students to indulge in “30 days and nights of literary abandon.”
Running through November, National Novel Writing Month encourages participants to break through their conventional snippets of thought and produce a 50,000-word novel from scratch — and USC students are taking part.
On campus, students and faculty are coming together for the writing challenge. USC’s NaNoWriMo (as the event is commonly abbreviated) group meets weekly, offering feedback to members and holding workshops to help each member get better and work toward his or her final word count.
Each participant discovered their passion for NaNoWriMo in a different way.
“I found out about NaNo when someone in my high school choir class came up to me and asked me to do it with her,” said Jamie Williams, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering .
Perhaps the most compelling quality about this endeavor is its ability to bring people together. The organizers of USC’s NaNoWriMo club hold several community activities throughout the month to let members bounce ideas off each other and to help members face the daunting task of creating a novel together.
The club’s Facebook group serves as a forum for writers to express their feats and frustrations, but the group also holds “write-ins” around campus where members can come together and work on their novels in a group setting. The next write-in is scheduled for Friday at 1:30 p.m. in Leavey Library Room 3Z.
“The spirit of comradeship around NaNoWriMo is a great help in getting over writer’s block,” said Joseph Peters, a graduate student studying professional writing.
To “win” NaNoWriMo, writers must upload 50,000 words to the website by midnight on Nov. 30. Winners are awarded a winner’s certificate, web badge and an official entry to the Winner’s Page, yet each newly minted novelist takes away his or her own unique prize from the challenge.
“NaNoWriMo is about pushing my limits and learning more about who I am and what I can do,” Williams said.
Those behind NaNoWriMo know how daunting the challenge can be for writers, especially first-timers.
“My first experience with NaNoWriMo was terrifying,” said Karthik Kumar Rao, a junior majoring in electrical engineering.
To help alleviate these fears, the Office of Letters and Light, the nonprofit organization behind NaNoWriMo, has set up its own built-in support system for participants. There are pep talks online from renowned authors such as Lemony Snicket and Mercedes Lackey, as well as USC’s own Aimee Bender, author and professor of creative writing.
“Not getting bored of my own story and/or character is one of the main struggles I have had with novel writing,” Bender said.
In her main tip to the writers in the challenge, she recommended, “Go where the writing goes.”
There is even a pep talk archive featuring advice from previous years, including more mainstream authors such as Meg Cabot.
Previous USC participants have their own advice for their peers.
“Don’t worry about it being a classic piece of inspiration,” Rao said.
Aside from helping writers hone their skills and motivating them to write, NaNoWriMo has other, more practical benefits as well.
“I walked out at the end of the month with incredible time management skills and a typing speed that allowed me to plow through assignments in no time,” Rao said about his first attempt at completing the challenge.
This is the event’s 12th successive year. The organization behind it, the Office of Letters and Light, started with 21 people in the San Francisco Bay Area and has since blossomed over the years, reaching writers across the world. Anyone interested in participating can simply sign up online at the event’s website, www.nanowrimo.org.
There, they can upload word-count updates and excerpts for others to read. Participation is not limited in any way: This is a rare event that attracts everyone from electrical engineering majors to unemployed auto mechanics.
“The reason I participate in NaNoWriMo is that it’s a great way to express creativity, meet new people, be completely insane for a month,” Williams said. “Everyone always talks about writing a book, but how many people can say they actually have?”
Because of the emphasis placed on completing the novel, many writers said they find themselves sacrificing quality for quantity.
“It doesn’t have to be good — it has to be 50,000 words,” Rao said.
Williams echoed Rao’s views on the challenge.
“The first year, I didn’t know what I was getting into,” she said. “I took it too seriously at first and tried to pick a suitably dramatic plot, which I got bored of really quickly and I only made it to around 35,000 words.”
Thanks to the culture built around National Novel Writing Month, participants have a strong network to turn to for support. They can understand each other and share in each other’s joy when the challenge is over. In fact, there is a NaNoWriMo “Thank God It’s Over Party” scheduled for the end of November.
Although the stories might vary, and the writers might live across the globe, one thing is clear: It’s time to write.

McDonald’s isn’t so happy about what San Francisco is doing to its Happy Meals.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors banned most forms of the McDonald’s classic Happy Meal on Tuesday as part of a measure that prevents fast-food restaurants from offering toys with kid’s meals if they do not meet certain nutritional standards. Because the measure was approved by an 8-3 vote — a veto-proof margin — the ordinance will pass, preventing Mayor Gavin Newsom from vetoing the law as he indicated he would.
It’s an interesting law that attempts to stem the tide of childhood obesity, rates of which have tripled throughout the past 30 years. In the world’s most predictable reaction, McDonald’s wasn’t exactly jumping for joy.
“We are extremely disappointed with this decision,” McDonald’s spokeswoman Dayna Proud said in a statement. “It’s not what our customers want, nor is it something they asked for.”
The statement also tried to highlight the nutritional side of McDonald’s food.
“Any fair and objective review of our menu and the actions we’ve taken will demonstrate we’ve added multiple options for parents to choose. This includes Apple Dippers … low-fat one-percent milk, 100 percent apple juice and Chicken McNuggets made with white meat,” the statement continued.
In any case, under San Francisco’s new law, McDonald’s and other similar restaurants will have until December 2011 to modify and boost nutrition in their kid’s meals if they wish to offer toys with the food. The law has many specific guidelines, including making sure that foods have a total caloric value of less than 600 calories and a sodium restriction of 640 milligrams.
It’s probably one of the smartest laws in recent memory.
But others might be horrified to find out about this. The government, they might cry, is trying to control everything. It might be a tad depressing to see the Happy Meals of our childhood disappearing, fries and all. And the measure might seem like it’s overstepping its legal boundaries.
After all, it’s up to the parents, no?
Yes, it’s true that McDonald’s and many other fast-food establishments have started to offer healthier options in recent years. And yes, it is ultimately up to the parents to figure out what diet is best for their child. But in the big picture, this measure might be an important step toward changing not only waistlines but the way kids think about food.
It’s pretty easy for a parent to say that they can control their child’s diet. After all, they are the parent: they order and pay for the food.
But in reality, it really can’t be so simple to deal with a kid who wants french fries instead of apple slices. Watching their disappointed son or daughter pout and fidget, perhaps on the verge of throwing a tantrum or just plain being bummed out, it can become easy for a parent to think, “Hey, maybe french fries just this time will be OK.”
And right there, the kid has gotten what he wanted: burger, french fries, toy. So from that moment on, it’s possible that the child has subconsciously concluded, “Wait, I can have my toy, and eat fries too.”
It’s not just fries, either. According to a new study done by Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, only 12 combinations of choices from 12 different fast-food chains met nutritional guidelines for preschool-aged children.
Surprising stat? It’s 12 out of more than 3,000 kids meal combinations, meaning there have been a lot of ways for kids to eat unhealthy but still get the toy.
How do you prevent this scenario from playing out? Take the pressure away from the parent and only create childhood correlations between healthy combinations and those oh-so-fun toys.
Opponents of the measure might counter that concerned parents should just not take their kids to get unhealthy meals and leave some freedom for everyone else. Again, sounds simple, until you get down to the nuts and bolts of it.
Parents aren’t just taking their kids to eat fast food — it’s the kids that are asking. The aforementioned Yale study found that 40 percent of children between the ages of two and 11 ask to go to McDonald’s every week.
Where are these tiny toddlers getting the idea that they should be eating fast food?  Could it possibly be the $4.2 billion that the study says the fast-food industry spent on advertising last year?
At the risk of sounding a bit Orwellian, it seems kids are prone to a little bit of brainwashing: A 2007 study by Stanford University found that kids prefer food from McDonald’s packaging to be tastier than the same food from plain packaging.
“Children under the age of seven or eight really do not have the ability to understand the persuasive intent of advertising and marketing,” said Dr. Thomas Robinson, an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford’s School of Medicine.
With Happy Meals, this “marketing” means one thing: serving up food with the always-desired toy. It’s important to recognize how much of an effect childhood eating patterns have in the long-term, creating happy connotations with nutritionally dubious meals. And it’s admirable that a city is willing to step up and force a fundamental change in how kids are eating.
It might not be the most subtle method, but this clash of law and industry will likely amount to positive changes. Sometimes, immediate happiness has to take a temporary backseat to lifelong health.

Just remove the toys from the Happy Meals & sell them separately.  You can already buy the toy without buying the meal now.  Easy peasy nice & cheesy.
I think it is the parents responsibility to tell their children no you cannot/should not eat that. If they want to take the initiative themselves to make their food healthier that is a business decision for them to make. My family very very rarely eats a McDonald’s, I’d say less than 5 times per year. If their for were healthier we would eat there more, but thats a decision they should be able to make themselves. Parents make that decision, we don’t give our kids alcoholic beverages because they come with a cute straw, we say no you can’t have that, it’s bad for you.
Zach, you are right. As to this law… This has nothing to do with obese kids. It’s a put on. There are so many things that make our kids obese: Reading; Homework (4 hours of homework a night = less exercise) and portion control, just to name a few. Is banning homework next? Are you going to now cut down the number of books my kid can take out of the library so she doesn’t read as much to perhaps make her go out and play? Of course not. Libraries aren’t big giant “Evil” corporations you are trying to tie the hands of. This is overboard, plain and simple. It’s also exclusionary, and don’t we teach our children to NOT exclude? Not every child is obese and it’s not my or my daughter’s fault if some parent wants to take their kids to McDonald’s everyday. Why should she be denied a toy because the once in a blue moon I take her to McDonald’s she decides she’d rather have fries and not apple dippers? I am not for laws that take freedoms away. Is this what our Veteran’s fought for? Is this what service men and women died in battle for? To take toys away from children? Apparently in San Francisco’s twisted mind, picking on someone who isn’t their size – and taking away the rights of healthy children (and parents) – is apparently what they did fight and die fought for. Whatever San Francisco. The reality is, it’s called “personal responsibility”. Banning toys does not teach parents going there all the time personal responsibility. It just punishes the little ones. Especially MOST children who ARE healthy and do go there. Whether or not my daughter gets a Happy Meal toy – or even eats a Happy Meal – is not for YOU to dictate to my healthy child San Francisco, and every day I am more and more glad I don’t live in a city with such a twisted perception of freedom and who obviously doesn’t understand the term “personal responsibility”. Which is what these parents need, not to be forced to eat the way The Man wants them to eat, or else you’ll be punished!
@Zach What you say is true to a point. However, oh so very often the parents have to tell their children that they cannot play with their toy until they finish their food. That’s telling me that the converse is also so very true, that kids don’t care what food they get, as long as it comes with a toy.
As for the food part of it, it’s addicting. Maybe not in a hard drugs kinda way, but certainly in a cravings sorta way. I’ll go into Wendy’s, my preferred fast food chain, and order something a few notches healthier. If I go with someone else, and they order fries though, immediately I start salivating like one of Pavlov’s dogs. My body has been conditioned to want those tasty, salt covered, deep fried, carb sticks. Same goes for drinking water with my food instead of getting a soda. The food just doesn’t taste right unless I’m sucking down carbonated corn syrup. 
Can I choose to consciously eat better? Sure. Can a child? Not really. In the home, at those early ages, getting children into healthy eating habits, can completely curb a sweet tooth later on. Personally, I was quite the sugar tooth, but, for the most part, I have grown out of it. But still, “Me never met a cookie me didn’t like”.
Bad eating habits are one thing. Bad exercise habits, are another. With so many parents feeling overwhelmed and simply medicating their children into a zombie-like state of submission or planting them in front of a television to act as their babysitter, it’s no wonder that obesity rates are on the rise. Bad food and bad exercise all stemming from bad parenting. It’s bad enough that children are out of the house forty hours a week with school to pick up bad habits form their peers, but to raise your children to grow up to be fat slobs just like mommy and daddy is inexcusable. 
Back to the main point of the article, despite the law that these highly paid government officials have passed, it won’t stop anything. As a customer, one can purchase a toy from a fast food chain without purchasing the meal, usually for only a dollar. So mom and dad merely have to buy  a small fry, some nuggets or a burger, a small soda, and a toy, and oh, look, it’s a Happy Meal!
Great article, with great research, but i must say….
This toy-ban was passed under the guise of childhood obesity legislation. Our kids will still be obese, just without toys. This sheepish legislation will do little to curb childhood obesity, it will only force fast-food chains to invent new marketing techniques. What we need are strict regulations regarding food, not rules about toys that accompany food. 
It’s not the kids who choose to eat fast-food, it’s the parents, and they don’t care about the toys. Parents choose fast-food because it’s fast, cheap, and convenient, not because their child gets a plastic choking-hazard souvenir. Honestly, the kids couldn’t care less. That smile on their face is not from the toy, it’s from the sugar in their food. Take away the toy and they still smile. Get it? IT’S THE FOOD.
[…] Happy Meal. The nanny state fascists disguised and well intentioned lawmakers have passed a law banning Happy Meals… for the children. You can abort as many kids you want in the city of San Francisco […]

The Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery sits tucked past the left of the entrance to Watt Hall, an area that seems always to be teeming with eccentric professors and tired architecture students alike. It might seem like a quiet space amid the hustle and bustle of the crowd, but thanks to a group of students from the Roski School of Fine Arts, it’s turning into a center for collaborative and experimental art.
Photo by Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan
Around 6 p.m., an hour before closing time, the area around the gallery is surprisingly quiet. Aside from a drawing class to the gallery’s right that hosts a nude model, not much appears to be going on. But inside the gallery, one finds the ultimate canvas for experimentation.
Eighteen seniors from Roski  have joined together to produce “Tooth of the Lion,” a text-heavy mural that goes beyond the traditional borders of the walls, spilling out onto the floor and the ceiling and using essentially the entire gallery as space for content.
Words cascade across the walls in severe dashes of neo-surrealist/dada spurts. For instance: “Hot s***/Cold diarrhea,” which explains the faux poo that piles on the hardwood floor, running down from the bottoms of letters.
As a piece of art, it enters the viewer’s consciousness in an experiential manner — through all parts of the body as much as through the eyes and ears. Entering the room, you get a sense of the work’s smell, touch, even the taste of the cold gallery air.
“Tooth of the Lion” emerged from an in-class discussion about the available outlets for student art.  In comparing exhibits within the university to those outside in the city of Los Angeles and beyond, it was decided that student artists needed a more-experimental venue for their work on campus.
The wall of the gallery is emblazoned with all the proposed titles the students invented for the fall senior exhibition.
“Pointing at an attempt to find common ground between disparate art practices, the artists pull from this set of potential titles, presenting the text visually in various forms on the walls of the gallery,” said the exhibit’s description.
Streamers and sticky letters adorn the walls, spelling out words that drift into languidity, presenting a mysterious undertone that suggests something unseen or nonsensical.
It reeks of young expression. The presentation exudes the great frustrated, exploding rage and beauty of being caught in the warped world of old adolescence and young adulthood.
It’s as if the 18 artists got up and went “blah” all over the walls — but in a good way — offering something soulful and true. The experience of taking in the exhibit is a refreshing one.
“Tooth of the Lion” started on Nov. 6 and will last until Nov. 16.
The exhibition exists alongside another project, “Bald Dandelions,” which shows individual works from the artists’ senior year. Works of photography, painting, drawing, ceramics, sculpture, video and printmaking will be on display until Nov. 14 at H Kazan Fine Arts on West Washington Boulevard off campus.
This art presentation has spawned a whole set of questions within Roski regarding the portrayal of student work. A Facebook group called “Off and On” serves as a message board for those who have concerns or propositions for future topics of student art exhibitions.
It is a virtual space created by the current senior class to discuss issues relating to the opportunities and response to student work on and off campus.
“The goal of this dialogue is to reclaim our campus exhibition spaces, specifically Helen Lindhurst Gallery, and to restructure the identity of the student show,” according to the group’s Facebook page. “Our hope is that rather than focusing solely on negative criticism or the current on-campus exhibition climate, members of the Roski community will make critical, yet constructive contributions to this important conversation.”
The online conversation will last until Nov. 30 and those who are not part of the Facebook community are encouraged to join in by emailing offandon409@gmail.com or reaching out to members of “Off and On.”
The breadth of creativity showcased in the two exhibitions shows a sense of exploration on the students’ part, indicators that the movement might be opening the doors to new opportunities in the way students are able to showcase their finished work.

The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center received a $1,000 grant to fund its peer mentoring program, which aims to help students develop a positive LGBT identity while successfully adapting to life at USC.
The grant was written by Christina Law, a doctoral student studying occupational therapy and the former mentor program coordinator, and Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.  It will go toward the LGBT peer mentor program’s assessment efforts.
“A lot of schools do not have a LGBT center or a LGBT mentor program. It takes a lot of effort to have a mentor program, and this grant will hopefully help us provide additional staff and personnel for the program,” Vigil said.
Vigil said peer mentors support mentees in a safe and caring one-on-one relationship as well as help them explore their personal interests, take advantage of campus resources and find their own sense of community.
“The peer mentoring program presents an opportunity for LGBT students to have a mentor on campus who has been through similar life experiences,” Vigil said. “The mentor and mentee are able to talk, share and learn from each other and build a strong relationship with one another.”
Andrea Elzy, mentor program coordinator, said that with the recent string of suicides by teenagers bullied because of their sexuality, programs like these are vital now more than ever.
“We are trying to provide an outlet and a community for students who are struggling with challenges regarding their identity so they feel like they are part of a larger community,” Elzy said. “With everything going on in the country with LGBT bullying and suicides, it is increasingly important to provide support for students who are seeking help and resources from the LGBT community.”
Peer mentors represent a wide variety of majors and personal backgrounds, Elzy said.
“Students from various participation levels and different backgrounds make the program unique,” Elzy said.  “It is nice to know that there is somebody in the program that has been through similar obstacles and can mentor students with anything they might be going through during their college experience.”
The peer mentoring program is open to all undergraduate and graduate students. This year, there are about 30 mentees and 30 mentors involved, Vigil said.
“The mentoring program is ongoing. We always try to have more mentors available than mentees,” Vigil said. “This program shows the person struggling that they are not alone and can talk to a trustworthy mentor about their sexuality or gender identity.”

USC and the Farhang Foundation recently announced a collaborative project to launch the school’s first Iranian Studies Initiative, which will bring Persian language classes to the College of Arts, Letters & Sciences and will allow students to minor in Iranian Studies.
“The details of exactly what courses will be offered and how quickly Persian studies will grow on campus has not been fully worked out,” Michael Quick, executive vice dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, wrote in an e-mail.
The Farhang Foundation, established in 2008 in Los Angeles, is a non-profit organization that seeks to celebrate and promote the study and research of Iranian art, culture and history for the benefit of the community at large, according to its website.
The Iranian Studies Initiative began when the Farhang Foundation contacted USC and offered the university the opportunity to bring an Iranian studies program to the college, Quick said. The idea came from a convergence of three different factors: USC faculty research about the Middle East, student interest in the Middle East and Persian and Arabic languages, and USC’s budding relationship with the Farhang Foundation.
“One of the reasons people came to us, Farhang in particular, is because they knew we cared about this,” said Bruce Zuckerman, professor of religion and linguistics.
Zuckerman said that he has been helping with this initiative in any way possible. He added that he hopes this initiative will go beyond just language classes and to will examine the culture and influence of Iranian culture.
“Languages are a great place to start because if you want to understand a culture, you can’t understand it in translation. You have to begin by understanding the language,” Zuckerman said.
Aside from including faculty in the initiative, the Farhang Foundation has also worked closely with the Iranian Graduate Students Association to help promote the initiative and spread awareness, said Yalda Khashe, a graduate student studying industrial and system engineering and member of the IGSA.
“I want this initiative to last and I hope people will react and take the classes. I want people to give it a chance and that non-Persians will attend the courses to find out about this culture,” Khashe said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about this culture around the world.”
Kevin van Bladel, an associate professor of classics who has also been involved in the initiative, attributes some of the push for Iranian studies courses to students realizing that knowing about Iran could be very important for their careers.
“It’s a region of the world that Americans don’t understand enough and the more courses we can offer in that, the better,” van Bladel said. “We want to build a bridge of understanding and we want to make it possible for students to listen to the world and listen to the languages the world speaks.”
Although the specific details of the initiative have yet to be established, Zuckerman said it should not take long for Farsi language classes to be offered to students because university officials realize the importance of building up a program of this nature.
“If you’re going to be world-class university that engages issues of world importance, Iran, modern, and Persian, ancient, and all that comes in between are things that we can’t ignore,” Zuckerman said.
Alia Delpassand, a junior majoring in political science, said she was sho cked when she first came to the university and found out Farsi was not taught. She added that she hopes this initiative will help students gain a better understanding of the Iranian culture.
“Unfortunately, within the media today, Iran is not depicted in a positive light — many associate Iran with anti-Semitism and [Iranian] President [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad. People do not recognize the deep-rooted Persian culture that has substantially impacted civilization today,” Delpassand said. “Having a program like this will definitely be a step toward shrinking the gap of hostility between Iran and the United States.”

A former USC School of Cinematic Arts student has been working with young women in the community to create a video showcase made up of public service announcements created by the girls.
Tani Ikeda, a USC alumna who graduated with a degree in cinema-television production in 2009, started a mentoring program in 2009 called ImMEDIAte Justice.
The program aims to help underprivileged minority women in Los Angeles get their voices heard and educate each other, she said.
“The program is to mentor high school girls from South Central Los Angeles in media literacy, film production and sex education,” Ikeda said.
Ikeda said that the inspiration for the program occurred one day while talking with her friends.
“It really started when me and a couple of friends from high school were reminiscing about some sex education classes and remembering how awful it was — about how embarrassing it was and how uncomfortable it was,” Ikeda said. “Especially how it made us young women feel like they got the short end of the stick.”
Partnering with the USC Institute of Multimedia Literacy, Ikeda sponsored a three-day retreat to enhance leadership and a six-week media literacy and pixilation animation training.
“We worked with high school girls that were peer advocates for Planned Parenthood and we created two short documentary films, one of which went to the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York,” Ikeda said.
The girls in the program were asked to create four 30 second-long public service announcements. Those PSAs were then put together into the video that ImMEDIAte Justice will be showcasing.
Ikeda said she created the documentary for young women who don’t have the resources available about safe sex and how to protect themselves.
“A lot of foundation and resources that used to be available for young people who are at risk have completely dried up and it’s really up to the ordinary people who really believe in their community and young people to volunteer their time and energy to create resources that no longer exist,” Ikeda said.
Ikeda said the documentary focused on creating exposure and amplifying the voices and concerns of young women who are typically misrepresented by the media.
“I think it’s really inspiring because our youth are disempowered in a lot of ways,” Ikeda said. “People don’t ask what they think is important or what wisdom they have because they are told that they are not old enough to have wisdom, which I disagree with.”
With that belief in mind, Ikeda said she wanted to make Los Angeles youth an agent for change.
Ikeda also said she wants to make ImMEDIAte Justice an international movement.
“We are currently talking to some international girl organization that wants to integrate media literacy into their program so we are hoping to make Immediate Justice go global and become a global bylaw between young women,” Ikeda said.
Though she has already graduated, Ikeda said she would like stay  with ImMEDIAte Justice in whatever capacity that she can in the future.
“Immediate justice is the combination of everything that I’ve always wanted in the world for myself as a young person growing up and it’s really connected to everything that I believe in,” Ikeda said. “My passion for filmmaking, my dream for revolution and I think film is an exceptional medium for helping people think outside the box of our everyday problems.”

When Keith Williams first came to USC, he said he immediately noticed that he was older than most of his peers by 10 to 12 years. He said he had a difficult time making friends and struggled to relate to the other students around him.
A six-year veteran of the United States Air Force, Williams is also a junior majoring in political science and is currently serving as assistant director of Diversity Affairs for USG.  He has spearheaded the upcoming events that will take place today in celebration of Veterans Day.
“It’s important to recognize what all the veterans have done and sacrificed for this country,” Williams said. “But at the same time we want to bring awareness to the fact that there are some very specific issues, both on the academic level and also in regards to mental health that need to be addressed.”
Yellow ribbons will be handed out to students and red, white, and blue ribbons will be given to veterans throughout campus on Veterans Day. There will also be an appreciation reception for veterans and non-veterans. The reception will feature a live band and a speech from Kevin Starr, a professor of history at USC and also the winner of the 2006 Natural Humanities Medal.
“This event can create push us in the right direction for recognizing our veterans and appreciating them more,” said Liz Trower, senior director of communications for USG. “Even if students don’t walk up to veterans and thank them for their service, we hope that they will at least start thinking about the veterans on campus and how they’ve contributed.”
The number of veterans attending USC has risen from 80 to 375 in the past three years, Williams said. With this increase, there has been a greater need to provide services specific to veterans such as lifestyle changes and mental health support.
Trower said that the presence of veterans on campus is an “asset because a lot of them provide a really different insight in most classes than the typical student” and that it is important that they feel appreciated.
The Veterans Day Appreciation Reception will be at the University Club from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Thank you VETS!!!

The Asian Pacific American Student Services has launched a Pacific Islander-focused initiative on campus in an effort to encourage more unity on campus.
The Promoting Unity, Liberation and Education initiative held its first panel event, We Are Leaders, last week. Pacific Islanders who are leaders in their own career fields spoke on the panel and discussed their experiences.
“It was really exciting,” said Sumun Pendakur, director of Asian Pacific American Student Services. “There were architects, there were filmmakers and there were physicians. People who were breaking the glass ceilings in their own fields, but at the same time, every one of these people were doing something with the community at the same time.“
Pendakur said the event targeted the goal of PULE: to create dialogue in the larger USC community around stereotypes held about Pacific Islanders, and encourage younger students to apply for higher education.
“People really wanted to create this space,” Pendakur said. “I think we as educators need to think, ‘How do we help students, how do we critically adjust stereotypes and how do we tell the stories that are untold?’”
Pendakur said she wants the program to help Pacific Islanders and students of all different ethnicities to come together and create a dialogue to help build community and break stereotypes.
“Too often when people think of Pacific Islander, they think of hula, or you have these broad sort of stereotypical images like football, gang members or lazy islanders,” Pendakur said. “This was the opportunity to build a community-based program and kind of shatter some of these stereotypes at the same time.”
Asian Pacific American Student Services is aimed at creating opportunities to help students with leadership development and mentoring, as well as expanding opportunities for cross-cultural involvement for students of different backgrounds.
“A couple of years ago I was thinking that too often the Pacific Islander part of the Asian Pacific Americans gets lost in the mix,” Pendakur said. “Pacific Islander issues have real specificities, and I wanted to make sure that we were not only talking about the specificities, but also really attempting to build more of a community here for Pacific Islander students and students of non-specific Pacific Islander backgrounds.”
Pendakur set up focus groups to gain input from both community-based leaders and activists as well as from Pacific Islander students at USC to gauge what they felt was missing from the university.
“We have all of the research available, but we wanted to really understand the small community size and the alienation felt by many Pacific Islander students expressed at the focus groups,” she said.
DannyBoy Naha-Ve’evalu, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television critical studies, is a project coordinator with PULE, and said USC needs more programs to help Pacific Islander students.
“I am Samoan, Tahitian, Hawaiian and French. I grew up and I identify with Samoan, and it makes me feel like I’m here for a purpose,” Naha-Ve’evalu said. “I think it is high time for Pacific Islanders to leave a mark and have that stage at USC.”
Naha-Ve’evalu said it was a difficult transition for him as a transfer student, since he did not have many people to identify with on campus.
“I felt like a needle in a haystack, and that is part of the reason why I think this program is important,” Naha-Ve’evalu said. “It not only helps Pacific Islanders learn about their own identity, but they have an organization where they can talk about issues in their community.”
Brittany Valdez, a graduate student studying social work who is also a project coordinator, said she would like to encourage more Pacific Islander students to apply to college.
“When I worked as an assistant director with the USC Marshall Undergraduate Admissions Office, I would continuously see low numbers of Pacific Islander students and professors in higher education.” Valdez said. “I became concerned, wondering why these numbers are low — not just at USC, but in universities nationwide.”
PULE’s next event is planned for Friday Nov. 12, when students will go to the Pacific Islander Ethnic Art Museum.
In the spring, Pendakur said PULE will host a number of programs, including film screenings, film festivals and educational volunteer opportunities. There might also be a Pacific Islander cultural arts showcase, she said.
Pendakur and the project coordinators said they are excited about the future of PULE.
“Hopefully we can get something going on with the ethnic studies,” Valdez said. “We hope to see it continue to progress and to keep this dialogue open against stereotypes.”
Pendakur plans to build a collaborative pipeline program with local area middle and high schools to increase Pacific Islander application and admission to USC in the future.

Bike controversies still need a voice
To USC officials:
To be truthful, I have appreciated your attitude and actions toward the student body since I enrolled in USC in the fall of 2007.  I believe that you actually have the opinions of the student body in the forefront of your reasoning, and as such I hope that you take what I say into serious consideration.
I agree with the vast majority of your bike policies.  Because of my job on campus, I have a clear knowledge of how student body traffic patterns work, and I think that it makes absolute sense to suspend wheel-based traffic through the center of campus.
However, your policies on the necessity of parking bikes in bike racks is not reasonable because of the fact that there are simply not enough bike racks to accommodate the number of bicycles used on campus.  The number of bikes has increased as the number of students living on or near campus has increased, yet the number of bike racks has not risen accordingly.
I believe that one of the most beautiful parts of USC is it’s residential nature.  It allows students from around the world to come to Los Angeles to have their college experience, and is at the heart of our ascent through the college rankings.
When you couple our residential nature with our campus’ unique flatness, our university creates an environment in which bikes will undoubtedly be present.
As such, we cannot enforce stringent laws on parking bicycles in designated racks, when it’s simply impossible for the students to abide by said rule. I feel that if the number of racks were to equal the number of bikes, you position  would not only be understood, but appreciated by the student body.
I love USC, and I know that this issue will ultimately be quite minor in the well-being of the university.
But I also feel that enforcing a policy that is actually impossible to abide by is at its root unfair, and as such I believe I should exercise my right to voice my opinion.
I appreciate your time,
Christian Edwards
Senior, public relations
I think this bike issue is pretty critical and however it needs to be handled, it should be done. As one of the few students without a bike, I’ve been hit multiple times; and in some instances given an apology and in others ignored. I don’t think that the bikes themselves are the problem, the obvious problem are the students who try to do too much while riding their bikes (drinking coffee, talking/texting on the phone, trying to hold a conversation with a another student that is walking, or the real kicker: stopping wherever they are to do whatever they please without regard to anyone else.) Surely this is a cultural ethical issue, because if you remove the bikes, these issues still pose a problem and are considerable rude; the texting pedestrian is just as cumbersome being ferried on two wheels (and in my opinion a bit worse), the student yelling on their phone whilst ignoring their physical counterparts is annoying, the people doing too much while walking (reading a book is by far the worst thing that I’ve seen)…you get the point. And although I acknowledge that students doing these activities on two wheels are more perilous due to the collision factor, I honestly believe them to be tantamount to those who are just as rude on two legs.
So in short, sanctioning the bikes will do nothing to stop the real issue: rude, selfish students. Meaning those that are, everyone who rides a bike doesn’t inherently fit this category. The real issue is getting people to understand what’s acceptable and what isn’t. But I’m a pragmatist, and highly doubt anything will be done about this…

Anyone of the opinion that USC is too rooted in tradition, campus pride and old money to be open to substantive changes in our university makeup just got a reality check.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
On Oct. 30, two major improvements paved the road for 21st century innovation in the President C. L. Max Nikias era.
The university announced plans for the construction of another facility here on campus — the new $70-million athletic building for student-athletes and their coaches.
Another building was opened by the USC Institute for Creative Technologies in Playa Vista, Calif., which showcases the latest technology intended  to support military training, mental health treatment and movie special effects.
As different as these facilities are in infrastructure, organization and the type of people they seek to attract, both buildings will embody of USC’s expansion in coming years.
From academic and athletic prowess to research and development to service in our communities, USC has always demanded excellence from every cornerstone of the university.
We are answering the call by choosing to lead that change — a change that is not only necessary for the university’s continued success but also fundamental in learning what makes this institution great in the first place.
We have the rare capacity to adjust our agenda to meet the needs of today’s students while remaining rooted in the Trojan principles of service and integrity.
Nikias said that the new ICT building “represents USC at its very best.”
“As a university, we truly shine in the area of applied research. We focus on solving societal problems. We concentrate on improving people’s lives,” Nikias said.
This is our long-standing mission at work, though years ago this convergence might not have seemed feasible. But ICT, growing from a few researchers a decade ago to a staff of 200, is now combining different areas of study under one roof — and using the latest technology to do it.
From teaching special skills to soldiers, to clinical training and utilizing visual effects for motion pictures, the ICT building will employ professionals from diverse fields such as the U.S. Army and the entertainment industry.
USC has never been hesitant to combine otherwise disparate fields of study.
In fact, it embraces the challenge of uniting them so that students might learn from one another, exchange ideas with firm conviction and build upon their passion for research — together.
After all, we now live in a world where contrary industries now must put their heads together to find solutions to society’s most pressing problems. Our education should reflect that environment so that we can be better prepared for the convergent world that soon awaits us.
The long-overdue athletic building sends a similar message of preparing our student-athletes for a world of competition — both on and off the field.
Some might see the new facility as another excuse to pamper student-athletes with a new 32,000 square-foot weight room, an 18,000 square-foot athletic training room, new locker rooms and lavish lounges.
But that’s only one side of the story. University leaders, including Athletic Director Pat Haden, see the need for combining success in athletics and academics in one cohesive facility.
In the interest of merging a passion for sports with a passion for intellectual growth, Haden announced that the ground level of the new building will be the Student-Athlete Academic Services center.
It’s understandable why Haden, a former Rhodes Scholar and USC student-athlete, made this such a priority. A carefully designed facility can help integrate the culture of USC athletics into the university’s vibrant academic atmosphere — where the best of both worlds complement each other’s success.
“I am excited that we are ready to move forward,” Haden said in a statement. “This new building will be the finest of its kind anywhere and will provide our student-athletes every opportunity to succeed academically and athletically.”
When opportunity for advancement arises, the university seizes it. And with the right leadership, supportive faculty and alumni and determined student body, there has never been a better time to do so.
Two new buildings. Two distinct purposes. One common vision.

State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell announced in late October the launch of the California Department of Education on iTunes U, the high-powered system within iTunes used to distribute educational audio, film and PDF materials for free to students and educators worldwide.
“Whether accessed through a desktop, laptop or smart phone, CDE on iTunes U will be an important tool for the continued professional development of our community of education professionals,” O’Connell said. “Educators now have more opportunities to access relevant information whenever and wherever it is convenient for them.”
There are now hundreds of media files on iTunes U from the CDE, with collections titled the “California Migrant Education Program,” the “Clearinghouse for Specialized Media and Translations” and “Common Core State Standards,” among others.
The implications of the California education system’s progress in the computerized direction are varied.
The system has some definite strengths; it’s a step above sending out a mass e-mail with an attachment to every teacher in the state. (Of course, that too is, for the most part, better than sending hard copies to every teacher in the state.)
It also has the capability to simultaneously hold and provide all the content that the CDE could care to have in one place.
Perhaps most importantly for the cash-strapped California public education system is that it costs the CDE nothing to the state to use the iTunes U platform for these purposes, meaning taxpayers and budget-stretchers alike can proclaim, “Hallelujah!”
But it does have some definite weaknesses. To begin with, it’s not very searchable; unlike a real searchable database, the content of the PDF documents are not from a consistent source or source type (such as journals, magazines, etc.) or able to be easily found based on content. One other especially inconvenient aspect of it is that one can’t simply browse all the content titles; one is limited to seeing “What’s New,” “Top Downloads” and “Top Collections.”
Perhaps its most controversial point of the CDE’s iTunes U platform use is rooted in the fact that the information on it is primarily aimed at teachers, not at students or parents.
It is encouraging that teachers will have a formalized location from which they can access some resources that would otherwise be either e-mailed or that they might not ordinarily receive.
However, based on what has been uploaded so far, it’s yet to be seen if extraneous energy is being devoted to this project by the CDE.
From what I remember about my experience in California’s public schools, I recall that most of my teachers didn’t have a lot of spare time or energy to read random educational materials for fun; most of the time they focused on getting ready for the next class, dealing with the impact of budget cuts (and the potential pink slips that might follow) and occasionally looking at the New York Stock Exchange.
If the teachers I knew from high school had the time to read anything, it would be something in their field of study.
Yet much of the content on the iTunes U as of now seems nonessential, some of it fluffy and cute but not very purposeful, and some of it exceedingly heavy and pedantic, such as the supposedly popular School Attendance Improvement Handbook, a 92-page document that I can’t imagine a single one of my teachers spending the time to read.
As it currently stands, the new iTunes U CDE platform will at most be the place for teachers to go only on the occasion that one of their colleagues recommends something on it, or that they’re required to read or access something from it.
This, however, will be the extent of the program until more organization, increased accessibility and greater relevance are made a priority.
Unfortunately, the old and tired question must be raised: Who is responsible for our lacking educational system — the students, the teachers, the state or the parents?
Based on the iTunes U CDE platform’s exclusive aim toward teachers, it seems doubtful that the state considers the teachers responsible and is actively trying to improve their performance. This is a growing movement in the United States today, as is evidenced by the Los Angeles Times’ value-added analysis teacher ratings and the emulative procedure taken in New York.
But it’s a lopsided path; after all, the typical, eager young teachers are eventually beaten down by the system and their lackluster students.
Although the CDE was trying to do a good thing by launching the iTunes U CDE platform, it definitely needs to be balanced by providing a similar platform for student self-improvement. Even if it’s just multiplication table songs for students to listen to on their iPods, that would be a step in the right direction.
Besides, isn’t iTunes and the Internet more the world of the 21st-century youth than of their teachers?
It only makes sense that if one is considering a resource of the sort that the CDE has attempted that one would consider making it pertinent to students, perhaps more than to teachers.

USC could cost the Auburn Tigers a national championship for the second time this decade.
No, the Trojans won’t be playing in the BCS title game. The sanctions handed down by the NCAA in June prohibit USC from playing in any postseason game through the end of the 2011 season. But as one writer for ArkansasSports360.com suggests, those sanctions could play a role in how the ultimate fate the 2010 Auburn Tigers is decided.
In an article published the Arkansas sports-centered website, author T.J. Carpenter explains that the recent allegations against Auburn’s star quarterback Cameron Newton — charges that include a representative of Newton’s demanding a six-figure payment to secure Newton’s signature on a national letter-of-intent — could affect how the NCAA and its voters rank the Tigers at season’s end.
“Voting for Auburn [for No. 1], putting support behind Newton, keeps the story in the public eye,” Carpenter wrote. “You can count on voters looking for other candidates for the Heisman Trophy and No.1 team in the country.”
Carpenter based his argument on his belief that the NCAA would not want to deal with taking away another illegally obtained national championship, thus avoiding “[having] egg on their face.”
“If there’s one thing I’ve learned about college football in the past few years it’s this,” Carpenter wrote. “College football would rather insulate itself from blame and hide its seedy underbelly at all costs than actively attempt to change the business of its sport for the better.”
Auburn is currently the No. 2 ranked team in the nation in both the BCS and AP national polls.

The Vienna Vegetable Orchestra gives the term “organic instrumentation” a whole new meaning.
Austria, the same nation that has given rise to musical greats such as Beethoven and Brahms, now boasts an experimental ensemble that seeks not to imitate but to explore a new musical realm — in this case what kind of instruments it uses.
Before each show, vegetables are whittled, molded and scraped to form instruments.  One such creation is the “cucumberphone” — an alternative to the saxophone — which uses a hollowed-out cucumber with a bell pepper on one end and a narrow carrot “reed” on the other. If these instruments break during the show, no harm done — there are always backup vegetables waiting to be played.
After the show, the orchestra makes soup — vegetable soup, naturally — and gives it to the audience.
Members of the orchestra say that audiences at times expect comedy; sometimes, they expect Mozart played with eggplant and squashes. The 11 Vienna Vegetable Orchestra members maintain that their experiment is not to be mocked.
In their continuing search for new sounds, the orchestra composed a third album, Onionoise, was released in the United States last week. The group also kicked off it’s U.S. tour on Monday in New York City.

The new USC Annenberg Institute for Sports, Media and Society will host a panel Thursday that will speak and answer questions about the role of ethics in the sports media world.
The event is part of the institute’s “Sports and Social Change” speaker series, and will take place in Town and Gown.
The  idea for the institute was first proposed by Daniel Durbin, a professor  in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
Durbin,  now the director of the institute, said he saw a variety of needs among  the student body that could be fulfilled by the institute. The ability  to begin expanded research into sports and media using resources  uniquely available to the Annenberg School is one of the major goals  that Durbin sought to accomplish with the creation of the AISMS.
“There  is not a better place in academe to build a world class institute for  study, research, teaching, professional programs and community outreach  centered in the intersection of sports and society through media,”  Durbin said.
The  goal of the Nike-sponsored speaker events is to “bring together  academics and professionals from the world of sport to discuss important  current issues impacting sports and sports media,” Durbin said.
The  event on Thursday will formally launch the institute and bring more  awareness to the programs that it can offer, both through the minor  offered in the Annenberg School or through internship opportunities and  career growth.
Pat O’Brien, a radio host on Fox Sports’ Loose Cannons show who spent 16 years at CBS Sports and nine years as an entertainment anchor on the shows Access Hollywood and The Insider,  will moderate the panel. The panel will feature MLB agent Scott Boras,  Olympic gold-medalist Tara Lipniski, former NBC Sports executive David  Neal, former CBS Sports executive Joseph Heitzler and sports  communication scholar Lawrence Wenner.
 
“Our goal is to enlighten, to bring the world to the student. I always  had a mentor when I was in college. It’s great for college kids to hear  from people who have been through it,” O’Brien said.
Boras,  who O’Brien said is perhaps the most famous sports agent in the world,  has made his clients a brand, making them actors and spokesmen for large  companies.
“Boras  has helped to create this star image, making his clients not just  athletes, but celebrities heavily involved in celebrity culture, which  has definitely changed sports media coverage,” O’Brien said.
Another topic that will be covered is how sports reporting has changed over the years because of the Internet and social media.
“There  are so many outlets to break a story. Anyone can buy a website and  think they are a journalist,” O’Brien said. “They’re not. People want  viewers and readers, and will go to great lengths to secure that  following.”
“We  have a great mixture of people who know what social media is about,”  O’Brien added. “We are going to inform students about the ever-changing  world of media through this event.”
