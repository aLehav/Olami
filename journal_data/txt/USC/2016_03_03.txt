The USC men’s basketball team will look to end the season on a high note and gain momentum heading into the Pac-12 tournament as the No. 9 Oregon Ducks roll into the Galen Center. The Trojans snapped a three -game losing streak with a win over the Oregon State Beavers on Wednesday night.
In their previous matchup in late January, the Ducks (24-6, 13-4) entered as the underdogs. At the time, the Trojans (20-10, 9-8) were sitting at 15-3 and had just been ranked for the first time since 2008.
Forward Elgin Cook led the Ducks with 26 points, five rebounds and four assists en route to an 89-81 victory. Forwards Dwayne Benjamin and Chris Boucher each added 16 points for the Ducks.
The game was close throughout, but the Ducks went on a 13-1 run midway through the second half to pull away 71-56. The Trojans never got closer than 7 again.
Freshman forward Bennie Boatwright had one of his best games against the Ducks, finishing with 23 points and 12 rebounds, his first collegiate double-double. Junior guard Julian Jacobs chipped in 18 points, six rebounds and five assists. The rest of the team combined to shoot 38 percent from the field.
The two teams have gone in opposite directions since their last matchup in Eugene. The Ducks have won 10 of their last 12 games, including the last time they played USC, and clinched at least a share of the Pac-12 title with their victory over UCLA on Wednesday. A win over the Trojans would give them their first Pac-12 title since 2002.
“They are a tough team. They’re a top-10 team in the nation for a reason,” sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “They have a little bit of everything: outside shooting, inside shooting, defense, blocking and the ability to spread the floor.”
The Trojans bounced back from their disappointing road trip to Oregon by winning their next three games. However, the Men of Troy lost five of their next six games before getting back on the winning track against the Beavers. USC currently sits at sixth in the Pac-12. A win over the Ducks along with a Colorado loss would give the Trojans the No. 5 seed heading into the Pac-12 Tournament.
Despite this being the last regular season game for both teams, there is a lot at stake.
The Ducks enter the Galen Center riding a four-game winning streak, where they have outscored opponents by an average of 11 points. Forward Dillon Brooks leads a well-rounded Ducks squad that currently has four players averaging more than 12 points per game.
Oregon has a strong offense, but their strength has been their defense. The Ducks are second in the Pac-12 in steals and blocks per game with 7.4 and 5.6 respectively. They also lead the conference in turnover margin.
One of the Trojans’ biggest weaknesses this season has been turnovers. In winnable games against Arizona State and Oregon State, the Trojans let the win slip away with high turnover rates. Oregon loves to feast on turnovers and get out in transition, something the Trojans will need to slow down if they hope to win.
Lucky for the Trojans, they are a completely different team at home. The Men of Troy boast a 16-1 home record, with their only loss coming at the hands of a strong Utah team.
“We’re 16-and-1 on our home floor,” head coach Andy Enfield. “So whatever magic they have needs to happen on Saturday because Oregon is one of the top teams in the country.”
Behind the likes of McLaughlin, junior guard Katin Reinhardt and Boatwright, the Trojans are one of the best 3-point shooting teams in the country. The Trojans seem to do better when they average around twenty 3-point shots per game, as they convert close to 40 percent of their attempts. The Ducks have the second worst 3-point defense in the Pac-12, something the Trojans should look to take advantage of.
“We really did something special at home this year,” Jacobs said. “I think we just have to defend our home court one more time, and we are motivated because of the last time we played them.”
Tip-off is set for 1 p.m. this Saturday, March 5. The game will be aired on the Pac-12 Network.

The game in Seattle came down to the final seconds in the Trojans’ 77-73 victory over Washington State on Thursday night. The teams traded the lead eight times throughout the first quarter alone, rarely gaining more than a 2-point advantage.
The Trojans only led by 3 points with under five seconds left as the Cougars blazed down the court for a final shot — a 3-point shot from the top of the arc — where graduate transfer forward Temi Fagbenle waited to make the play to save the game.
Fagbenle leapt in the air, a single arm stretched out, and the shot met her palm solidly. She pulled the ball into her arms, nearly tripping over the Washington State player as she dribbled into safety and straight into a foul.
After slowly crossing the court, Fagbenle nailed one of the free throws. Key Arena quieted, the air sucked out of it. Four points in 3.6 seconds. All that was left was a time out, a final desperation play. The inbounds pass was tipped and the final buzzer sounded with the ball in Fagbenle’s arms. The win advanced the Trojans to the next round of the Pac-12 Tournament, where they will face No. 1 Oregon State.
For the first half of the game, it was impossible to tell which team controlled the pulse of the game. The Cougars started the game with a quick layup and USC answered with a converted 3-point play. From there on, it was a tug-of-war for the lead, with neither team pulling ahead by more than a handful of points.
As the half wore on, however, the Trojans found their rhythm. Sophomore guard Sadie Edwards ended the first quarter with another 3-point play and junior guard Courtney Jaco warmed up from behind the 3-point line as well. With their offense coming together, the Trojans were able to stretch their lead to 4 points.
But in the final two minutes, Fagbenle took an awkward hit, falling to the ground with a cry of shock and hugging her knee to her chest. She sat out for the rest of the half and in a minute and a half Washington State went on a 9-0 run to take a lead into the half.
The second half brought the same back-and-forth play, but in the third quarter, it was Jaco who stepped up to carry the Trojans. Jaco shot 4-4 on the quarter, hitting all three of her 3-point shots to keep USC on top. She went on to finish the game with only one missed shot, notching five 3-point shots and ending with 19 points.
Her performance was bolstered by 18 points from Fagbenle — who also pulled down 17 rebounds for yet another double-double on the season — and another 17 points from Edwards, who came alive in the fourth quarter. In total, seven of nine players put points on the board, providing a spread-out offensive attack that outlasted the Cougars.
Now, the Trojans are set to take on Oregon State in the second round of the Pac-12 tourney. The game will take place on Friday at Key Arena at 6 p.m., and will be broadcasted on the Pac-12 Network.

When the Trojans take the floor at the Galen Center on Saturday afternoon for their final regular season game against the Oregon Ducks, they will already have had achievements this year that couldn’t have been imagined back in early November.
For a team that hadn’t had a winning record in four seasons and hadn’t made it past the first round of the NCAA tournament in seven years, jumping from bottom-dweller to their first 20-win season since 2009 is a major step in the right direction.
Consider the bleak history of the program — one that has been overshadowed by that other school across town — with a dispassionate fan base and little to no expectations entering the 2015-2016 season. The last time USC tasted palpable, consistent success was from 2007-2009 when they made three consecutive trips to March Madness, and even that was tainted by O.J. Mayo’s NCAA violations that wiped out the entire 2007-2008 season.
This is what makes what the Trojans accomplished this season so refreshing: not only has their success been scandal-free — somewhat atypical of USC athletics — but, sporting just one senior, the team is young and primed to be a factor both now and in the future.
Head coach Andy Enfield will tell you that there was no timetable on turning the program around, but realistically, no coach gets a three-year honeymoon period, no matter how young and inexperienced the players are. Enfield led the Trojans to a 23-41 overall record and a meek 5-31 performance in conference play in his first two seasons, and it was safe to say that another subpar campaign would have put the head coach on the hot seat.
As if the basketball gods intervened and spared USC from another coaching change in a major sport, the Trojans have suddenly found continuity and a keeper in Enfield. He has done a masterful job of keeping a positive attitude through the trials and tribulations of his first two seasons, developing and instilling his system despite the lack of results on the scoreboard and meshing the core players he inherited — juniors Nikola Jovanovic and Julian Jacobs — with the recruits he brought in.
Perhaps prospects are inherently drawn to USC based on its proximity to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, but Enfield already has amassed talented crop of young players that should draw more prized recruits in the coming years. Sophomore guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart can only get better, and freshmen forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright are already making a major impact.
The style of play has also been a huge plus. Enfield has successfully implemented the kind of free-flowing, ball movement-heavy, up-tempo offense that wins games in today’s basketball, not to mention its appeal to casual fans that USC is trying to draw. The Trojans’ 103 dunks in their first 29 games have earned them the nickname “Slam City.”
However, it’s difficult to go from 0 to 100 in a season, as the Men of Troy have found out. With initial success come growing pains. The 15-0 home start was nice, but the discrepancy between their play at the Galen Center and on the road — where they are just 3-7 — is noticeable, with the team losing its last six away games.
Nowhere was this more apparent than last weekend in the Bay Area, when the Trojans were stomped by both Stanford and Cal. In both games, they ran their offense and had good looks at the basket, but the shots didn’t fall. Perhaps overwhelmed, their inexperience showed and their defense faltered as well, leading to disappointing games on both ends of the court.
The road struggles are noteworthy, because if the Trojans are to do well in the Pac-12 tournament and beyond, they will need to figure out a way to win away from the Galen Center. Despite their recent slide, losing five of seven games, most experts have USC penciled in as a seventh-to-ninth seed in the NCAA tournament; still, an early exit in Las Vegas may very well drop the Trojans into the bubble on Selection Sunday.
Nonetheless, that USC is in the conversation for March Madness regardless of the result against Oregon speaks volumes to the turnaround Enfield and his players have accomplished. The ride thus far has been unexpected and marvelous – and it isn’t over yet.

The Daily Trojan had the opportunity to sit down with sophomore guard Elijah Stewart to get to know him and his teammates a little better. Stewart is currently averaging 10.1 points and 3.7 rebounds a game while shooting 44.4 percent from the field overall and 42.7 percent from behind the arc. Here’s what he had to say:
Daily Trojan: What’s your favorite basketball memory?
Elijah Stewart: My best basketball memory that I can tell is when my high school team went to Hawaii [for a tournament].
DT: When was the first time you dunked?
ES: In a game, ninth grade, and it was an and-one.
DT: What’s your go-to dunk?
ES: Classic windmill.
DT: Who on the team is the best dancer?
ES: Best dancer? Outside of me, probably Shaqquan [Aaron]. He knows his moves that don’t make him look awkward.
DT: Best rapper?
ES: Julian [Jacobs]. It’s not even close, he is by far the best.
DT: Who is your favorite superhero?
ES: I just started watching Young Justice, and they’re big on the sidekicks coming up, so Aqualad, because he’s the only black superhero, and also Green Arrow.
DT: What is your spirit animal?
ES: Peacock, they look so nice, but they don’t let you get close to them, and I don’t like people touching me. You can look from a distance, but you can’t touch.
DT: But, you play basketball…?
ES: Oh for sure, and if you notice, I try to avoid all types of contact.
On a serious note, they say people have three faces, and basketball is just one of my faces.
DT: What other sports could you play at USC?
ES: I could definitely walk-on track. For sure, football as a wide receiver. Tennis, I don’t think I could walk-on to the tennis squad. I couldn’t play water polo. Water polo players are crazy, mad respect there. I could for sure get baseball too. Put me in left field though, I ain’t trying to get too much action on defense; I’m more of a hitter.
DT: What is your favorite place you have visited?
ES: Italy. It was for basketball, but the competition was pretty good, but not as developed as here.
DT: What is your favorite place on campus?
ES: Campus Center is cool. I like Ground Zero on Mondays because that’s Open Mic Night, and you can hear awkward stand-up comedy.
DT: What is your favorite class?
ES: Dance class over the summer. It was traditional dance; we focused on ballroom.
DT: So you can take a girl out dancing?
ES: No. But I do know the different kinds of ballroom dances, but I would need to refresh myself on the material.
DT: What is your favorite food?
ES: That’s a tough one. I love food. I am a food connoisseur. I would recommend Flossie’s. It’s somewhere around the Forum. It’s like soul food, Louisiana type food.
DT: What is your favorite pro team?
ES: Warriors
DT: Have you been a fan before this season?
ES: Oh for sure, even when [Steph] Curry was out there rolling his ankles every game.
DT: Who is your favorite basketball player?
ES: Probably Curry because not just up on the court, but he’s a family man. He isn’t around doing any weird stuff.
DT: What’s your ideal first date?
ES: For sure, first date. I’m taking a girl to … Hold up, I really got to think about this. The first date, you don’t want to go sit down and eat; y’all don’t really know each other. That’s not really interactive. You don’t want to take them to the movies ’cause you don’t get to talk … Like what did y’all do? You just sat next to each other for two hours. So I’m going to take you … We got to work on some team-building skills, so we’re about to go paintballing.

The No. 22 USC baseball team will headline the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic at Chavez Ravine, Sunday, when they face crosstown-rival UCLA after tournament games against Oklahoma on Friday and No. 20 Mississippi State on Saturday respectively  at Dedeaux Field.
After winning five of their last six games, senior reliever Brooks Kriske says that this Trojan team is “hitting its stride,” as they look to build upon their 7-4 victory against Long Beach State on Tuesday. Against the 49ers, Kriske added to the superb outing from the bullpen by pitching a strong ninth inning, which kept the Trojans safely ahead after their quick 5-run second inning led by a two-run homer by sophomore infielder Adalberto Carrillo.
“As a freshman, we went through a ton of adversity as team, and it has gotten better and better because we have all kind of grown and gotten better as players together,” Kriske said. “So, as an older guy now, it was nice to see some of the younger guys bounce back from a tough first series loss.”
Coming off of their first series win against Wake Forest last weekend after poor hitting performances to begin the season, USC head coach Dan Hubbs is also impressed with the team’s resiliency. Hubbs noted that the team lost its first two games of the season but since then has turned it around and won four of its last six.
Though USC left 16 runners in scoring position and scored 7 runs on Tuesday and left 15 on while scoring 9 on Friday against Wake Forest, Hubbs says that the team’s number one priority is for the batters to improve in scoring situations with runners on base.
“You can tell by just how many guys we have been leaving on base that we need to improve. If we can relax on that spot and make that more productive, then I think you will see our run score go up,” Hubbs said. “When you score 9 and win or you score 7 and win, it does not seem like a big deal. But if you leave 14 [on] and you score 4, and you lose 5-4, then it seems like a bigger deal.”
Aside from the magnificent Trojan bullpen play all season long led by Kriske, sophomore Mason Perryman and redshirt junior  Joe Navilhon, Hubbs plans to start pitchers senior Kyle Davis against Oklahoma, junior Bernardo Flores against Mississippi State and senior Brent Wheatley against UCLA. Wheatley had a strong start Sunday in his last outing against Wake Forest in which he pitched six complete innings, while allowing just one run on three hits, and earning six strike outs.
USC players are collectively excited about their opportunity to play at a major league park on Sunday. In what is sure to be one of many future appearances for the MLB-bound reliever at Dodger Stadium, Kriske said that once warm-ups are finished, and the first pitch has been tossed, he looks forward to competing like any other game.
“Last year we had 10,000-plus people come, but it almost feels like there are more people here [at USC] when there are 2,000 people,” Kriske said. “It’s cool though because you feel like a major league player, and everyone gets amped up and usually plays a very solid game.”
The first pitch Friday night is scheduled for 6 p.m. while Saturday’s game will begin at 1 p.m., and Sunday’s Dodger Stadium game is slated for 3 p.m.
Editor’s Note: This post was updated to correct the spelling of head coach Dan Hubbs’ name. 
What are you talking about, John? Dante Flores graduated last year and was not a pitcher. Do you or anyone else ever
proof read the articles? How about an update on Mitch Hart who has not pitched all season at this time?

Self-balancing scooters, commonly known as hoverboards, are now banned from on-campus residence halls and university-owned housing, according to an email to students sent by Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry Thursday evening.
“Due to the recent fire concerns surrounding hoverboards … the University has decided to prohibit their use and possession in University owned residence halls, apartments and houses,” Carry said in the email.
There have been several documented incidents of the lithium-ion batteries inside hoverboards exploding, in some cases leading to extensive property damage. Just last month, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission sent a letter to manufacturers and distributors of hoverboards in which they said, “Consumers risk serious injury or death if their self-balancing scooters ignite and burn.” According to the letter, between Dec. 1, 2015 and Feb. 17, 2016, the CPSC received 52 reports of scooter fires resulting in $2 million of property damage.
The decision to ban the scooters at USC was made in consultation with USC Student Affairs, Housing, Environmental Health and Safety, Fire Safety, Department of Public Safety and Risk Management, according to the email. Carry said in the email that this ban was made in order to protect students and prevent property damage.
“There will be no penalty [for possessing a hoverboard],” Carry said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Think of it this way: in our residence halls, we don’t allow candles. They’re a fire hazard; if you light it, you can burn the building down. Similarly, we won’t allow hoverboards in the residence halls.”
To enforce the ban, Residential Assistants will be making sure that residents are not using hoverboards in the dorms, according to Carry. But Carry also said that RAs will work with students to either get rid of their hoverboards or store them safely.
“The RAs will work with the students to either ship the hoverboards back home or store them elsewhere,” Carry said.
John Landi, a senior studying communication and business, agreed with the ban.
“It’s acceptable to ride [a hoverboard] on campus, but when you have them in the residence halls, it’s very unnecessary,” Landi said. “I don’t see why they’re even in residence halls in the first place. They have a tendency to explode and catch fire.”
Carry reiterated that — despite still allowing use of hoverboards on campus — the ban is a student safety issue.
“What’s the trade off? We’re trying to prevent a residence hall of 600 students from burning down,” Carry said.

Late last Tuesday night, members of the Roski School of Art and Design Undergraduate Student Collective, a student organization not officially recognized by the University, put up two large posters on bulletin boards across from the Lindhurst Gallery. By 9:00 a.m. Wednesday morning, these posters were removed.
In response, the students printed and posted smaller copies of a faculty solidarity document, which were were also promptly removed by the University.
One poster was a statement in support of faculty unionization at Roski, and the other was a list of the students’ proposals for increased studio space and art equipment.
Upset by the speedy removal of their messages, the student group took to their collective Tumblr page to publicize what happened to their posters, along with digital copies of the posters and the following statement:
“We believe the USC Roski School of Art and Design is taking efforts to silence and censor student voices, particularly those of dissent. During our Open Forum at the end of last semester, …  we were told we would have access to post on these bulletin boards, but that is clearly not the case.”
Though the students believed they had been censored, Penelope Jones, assistant dean for student services at Roski, said in an email to the Daily Trojan that the posters were removed because they violated SCampus guidelines.
“They covered up and/or took down other messages that had already been posted on the board,” Jones said.
Certain boards in and about Watt Hall are designated specifically for gallery and job postings, grad school recruitment and other announcements, according to Jones. The group also posted flyers on windows, doors and walls, which were removed by facilities for the same reason.
One representative of the undergraduate collective group, junior art comparative literature major Kate Riccitiello, recognizes that their large posters were covering up other messages on the board, but that they were desperate to be heard. Following a forum they held with the school in December in which they outlined, among others, their goals for more studio space and art show opportunities, she felt they needed to take action.
“I still think it was wrong for them to be removed, but they did cover other people’s stuff,” Riccitiello said. “We were fed up with not having received any response to what we were saying, so we were trying to play all our cards at once and force their hand.”
As for the smaller posters, Riccitiello doesn’t believe that they were an obstruction because they were only 8.5×11 pieces of paper.
Whether or not the papers were truly an obstruction, the speed at which they were removed is enough to cause concern for sophomore fine arts major Jeremy Reynoso, who is also a representative of the Roski Undergraduate Collective.
“I think it’s important to note that these were removed so quickly, and there are posters on those bulletin boards up for events that happened two months ago that weren’t urgently removed,” Reynoso said.
He said that the school urgently removed the signs because they were concerned about prospective students visiting.
“Because it’s recruitment season, a bunch of people are walking through going on tours, and they don’t want their prospective students to see anything wrong with the school,” Reynoso said.
Whatever the reason, the quick removal of these posters created a tension that exposes the ongoing conflict in Roski that began last spring when the Masters of Fine Arts students left in protest of administrative changes, particularly the addition of Dean Erica Muhl.
Indeed, since Muhl’s employment as Dean, Roski professors and MFA students have dropped in numbers, leaving behind consolidated classes, nearly empty MFA studios and just one MFA student. Following these systematic changes and subsequent dissent, attempts have been made to open up SCampus-approved communication between students and faculty with open forums and meetings. Associate Professor and Vice-Dean of Faculty at Roski Sherin Guirguis said in an email to the Daily Trojan that she is glad to see the students speaking out and welcomes the suggestions.
“I’m thrilled to see our students actively engaged in the process of envisioning the future of the school,” Guirguis. “A number of Roski students have made very thoughtful suggestions, and we have already taken steps to implement a number of these … We continue to welcome student suggestions and aim to keep the lines of communication between students, faculty and administration open.”
In response to student requests, Roski has bought new photography equipment, financed an international fine art study tour in May and a senior exhibition, which is planned for Spring of 2017.
The most recent effort to open communication lines and avoid conflict with SCampus guidelines is the formal dedication of a Roski student-only bulletin board. Following the poster removal, the students were given rights to post on a particular bulletin board after they met with Jones, Guirguis and Lecturer of Design Jeff Cain on Friday.
“In December, and again last week, we offered assistance to the student group in posting their views in compliance with SCampus, and we have now set aside a large bulletin board for the exclusive use of Roski students,” Jones said in an email to Daily Trojan.
According to Riccitiello, however, who called Friday’s meeting “very disturbing,” their new public bulletin board is not public enough.
“They gave us [a bulletin board], but it’s really hard to find,” Riccitiello said. “You would really only pass it if you’re going to the sculpture room …They told us to just tell people to go look at them if we want them to see it.”
Riccitiello also said that she was unsurprised by the relatively small win because it was typical of her previous interactions with the faculty and administration.
“This happens every time we meet with administration, where we have questions and things we want addressed, and they kind of talk around them or act like they’re doing what we want them to do, but they’re really not,” Riccitiello said.
This frustrates Reynoso, who recognizes the time-consuming complications involved with making widespread changes, but also feels like they really aren’t asking for much, especially with the acquisition of studio space.
“I feel like they make it seem like we’re asking for too much,” Reynoso said. “But a lot of the issues have solutions.”
Riccitiello echoed Reynoso, saying they just expected the same as any other arts school.
“Other fine arts programs have senior shows. Their students have studio space,” Riccitiello said. “These are all things we should expect from USC.”
Despite their general frustration, the representatives from the undergraduate collective reiterated that they don’t dislike Roski or blame the faculty. On the contrary, their dissent stems instead from a genuine appreciation for their school and a desire to see it eventually reaching its full potential.
“Everything that we’re doing is coming from a sincere love for our school, because before anything ever happened, Roski was a really amazing place,” Riccitiello said. “We really care about the school, and we want to make it better not just for ourselves, but for future students.”

With the last week of midterms season fast approaching, students may be using USC alumnus Randy Horowitz’s app Toot, which provides in-person tutors to students who need extra help.
The app connects students with the nearest available tutors within 24 hours. All of the tutors are tested, background-checked and interviewed to ensure the quality of tutoring services. Students can easily pay for the service through cashless, secure payment system similar to Uber’s payment system.
“We got obsessed with the idea of being able to quickly connect students with in-person teachers, because there was nothing else like that.” Horowitz said. “Everything else in the industry was very fragmented — there wasn’t a centralized plate to help students find the tutors, especially one in the form of phone application.”
The mobile app was launched in April 2015, and Toot already has held more than 1,000 tutoring sessions and has more than 1,200 tutors available. Toot is planning on expanding to new topics, such as cooking, music and art, in addition to the currently offered traditional academic subjects.
Any USC student can be part of it — either to apply to become a tutor or to get help from the tutors. Tutors are not only limited to tutoring college-level courses, but can also help with high school classes and standardized testing preparation.
“USC undergraduate students, graduate students or recent alumni make up the group of tutors near USC,” Horowitz said.
Students can also set the price for the tutoring services they offer, depending on the type of class they are requesting help for.
The company started from a personal experience. According to Horowitz, Sophia Parsa, CEO of Toot, was a student at Loyola Marymount University and her tutor canceled on her session on the eve of her final exam as the his wife went into labor. She then found a tutor at 11 p.m., studied for four hours, and was able to pass the exam.
“She realized that students need an easier way of accessing and connecting with qualified tutors face-to-face,” Horowitz said.
Parsa found Horowitz when she needed someone who had the financial and business background to turn the idea into a business. Shakib Zahibian also joined as a CTO. Currently, Horowitz serves his role as CFO of the company.
Students have found the app appealing. Jared Thomas, a graduate student in public administration, said he was satisfied with his experience using Toot.
“My experience using Toot and finding a tutor has been extremely convenient and user-friendly,” Thomas said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Especially, when compared to the amount of footwork and networking I had to do to find the Ph.D. student.”
According to Thomas, Toot was an affordable option for him to get prepared for the courses he needed help in. He was capable of finding a tutor who is both familiar with graduate level statistics and with the Price program.
“I have a master’s in English, knowing very well that math is my Achilles [heel], and with that said, I can easily see myself using Toot once a week,” Thomas said.
Thomas said there are differences between Toot and other available services on the market. He found that all the publicly available tutoring options are both inconvenient and unaffordable.
“In about a week, I quickly learned that the Ph.D. student, a master of the subject, was simply too far removed from my level of understanding,” Thomas said. “I couldn’t keep up with someone who quite literally calculated decimal numbers in his head.”
According to Thomas, with the prior service he used, he was capable of getting the help he wanted for $50 an hour. Toot helped him maintain his schedule and took away the stress of finding a qualified tutor.
“Simply find the class you need help in, when you need it, and where to meet and Toot finds a tutor that fits your request,” Thomas said.

With an undefeated record and two weeks off from competitive play, the Women of Troy are ready to take on Michigan and Vermont Friday and Saturday, respectively, at home.
“We’re just excited to have another game,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “It’s been a long stretch. It was a good opportunity, though, to rest our bodies and to make sure that we’re improving on the things that we saw from the first two games.”
In just their fourth year as a program, the Trojans have raced off to their best start in program history with a 2-0 record, including a commanding 11-5 win against No. 5 ranked Duke on Feb. 20.
In the team’s success, the veteran seniors and strong team chemistry have been instrumental.
“Our seniors have done a great job not only bringing in our freshman, but also welcoming my class, and they do a great job not only leading by example, but also making sure everyone is included,” sophomore goalie Gussie Johns said. “I’ve found that the closer your team is, the better you play together, and I really think that’s one of our strengths going into the season.”
In the team’s two victories, Johns and the Trojan defense have only allowed seven shots to enter the back of the net.
“Our defensive unit is so close,” Johns said. “We’ve had the same unit for the past two years, and that’s really helped us. We’ve just worked really hard to get that cohesiveness, especially throughout preseason.”
Maintaining a strong defensive front will be crucial for the Trojans as they prepare to face Michigan’s powerful offense. With six games under their belt and a 4-2 record, the Wolverines have produced dominant wins against Central Michigan, Marquette, SDSU and Canisius while only losing to No. 7 Florida and Oregon by a margin of one in each game. A key asset to the Wolverine offense will be junior captain Tess Korten, who was crucial in the team’s win against Canisius, notching a hat trick in the first half.
The Trojan offensive lineup boasts junior attacker Michaela Michael, who won MPSF Player of the Week following the team’s win against Stetson, and junior attacker and midfielder Kylie Drexel who scored four goals against Duke.
With two weeks off, the Trojans have been honing in on their technical skills and focusing on getting better each and every day. In their first match-up in program history, the Trojans are excited for the opportunity to play a new team.
“The biggest thing is we always want to focus on us,” Munday said. “We need to make sure we focus on the details and make sure that we play our style of lacrosse all over the field. We want to be in charge. It’s exciting to play a new team that we haven’t seen before.”
The Women of Troy will battle against Michigan at 3:00 p.m. Friday at McAlister Field and Vermont Saturday at 3 p.m. at the same location.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
For Trojans returning to campus in the fall, tuition for the 2016-2017 school year will now be $51,442 — nearly $2,000 more than this year’s cost of tuition, which clocked in at $49,464.
Students did not find out about this increase via a campus-wide memo or stumbling upon it in a USC News update — if they are aware of it at all, it’s likely through complaints made on social media after a student noticed that the estimated cost of attendance for prospective students had been updated on the USC financial aid website and that this cost was significantly higher than that of the previous year. While Provost Michael Quick has since issued a statement on the topic, he did not address why tuition was being increased in the first place.
The cached version of the USC financial aid web page, entitled “How Much Will My Education Cost?” shows that the page was updated with next year’s tuition figures sometime between Sunday at 9:43 p.m. and Tuesday at approximately 10 p.m., when students began noticing the new figures.
This is not the first time USC has failed in its obligation to keep students informed about tuition hikes. In fact, the Daily Trojan editorial board published a similar unsigned editorial last fall, when the University failed to properly disclose to students its $951 tuition hike at the beginning of the fall 2015 semester. As a result, it is especially disappointing to see that the University has again failed to acknowledge the issue of rising tuition or — at the very least — to make more of an effort to be transparent with their decisions.
Beyond increasing already-steep tuition, this tuition hike is particularly problematic. Ignoring both student voices represented by Undergraduate Student Government and national conversation regarding student loans nationwide, the University is proving itself to be alarmingly out of touch with the needs of its students. Last semester, USG passed a resolution in November regarding college affordability, advocating for transparency as well as an immediate tuition freeze. Even assuming there is a genuine need for yearly tuition hikes that outpace inflation, it is unacceptable for the University to continue to offer no explanation and ignore the voices of USG and the countless students who have had trouble paying for tuition.
Seemingly random and arbitrary tuition hikes don’t just price potential students out — they make it difficult for current students and their families to plan financially. Many families already barely make the cut in paying for tuition at last year’s rate, so if USC continues to raise tuition by different amounts with no warning or notice every year, a huge percentage of the student body will face avoidable problems.
As the Daily Trojan has pointed out before, USC’s increasing tuition — already one of the highest in the nation — has a negative impact on diversity and prevents students who could make a meaningful contribution to the student body from attending. To opaquely increase tuition undermines the University’s claims that the administration is trying to cultivate an inclusive, diverse and academically-minded environment.
Tuition hikes, even more than most decisions made by the University, require transparency — they profoundly affect all undergraduates and place a heavy burden on students and their families. If students absolutely must pay more, tuition increases should come with plenty of advanced notice — the University must offer students a comprehensive breakdown of what the increases will fund, and it should offer resources and plans for students who may be put into a difficult financial situation. At the moment, USC’s behavior indicates that they are hiking tuition solely because they feel they can get away with it.
Daily  Trojan Spring 2016 Editorial Board
This is only the beginning of the US college meltdown.  Working-class people will be hardest hit, while elites will profit from the crisis. #degreesofinequality
*Whispering* Don’t apply to USC if you know beforehand it will be financially onerous. We’re not in the dark ages where there’s no Internet and people just go by hearsay.
No one is forcing anyone to attend USC for their education.  For the price-conscious consumer, there are public schools such as Cal State and the UC system, not to mention out-of-state options.  That’s the beauty of competition in the marketplace.  No more whining, please.
Thank you for publishing this critically important piece.

An intern on a high-stakes political campaign is constantly in motion. Preparing for a life as a political operative, these college students dutifully neglect time with friends, regular exercise and non-processed food in favor of endless hours on the phone and a nightly dinner of Twix bars and pretzels slyly taken from the volunteer table. A committed intern chooses to invest his or her time into a political campaign due to a sense of idealism combined with ambition. But this campaign intern will not receive any monetary returns on their investment.
Denying interns pay for mountains of work is a time-honored tradition on political campaigns. But voters increasingly cry foul at the notion that presidential campaigns can raise tens of millions of dollars but fail to pay dedicated entry-level workers. The issue has become especially vexing for campaign managers that must balance public relations concerns with the needs to control costs and keep the volunteer base that supports campaigns intact. However, despite the risks, political interns should be paid — but not by individual campaigns.
Although presidential campaigns now raise more money than ever, campaign field infrastructure has complicated intern compensation. The neighborhood team model of organizing, popularized by the 2008 Obama campaign, encourages civic action from the ground up, with a campaign’s field staff working to recruit, train and support volunteers who spread a candidate’s message.
Volunteer leaders are the key players in this process — they influence their friends and neighbors to take action. Ideally, a community network of volunteers organically develops. In the days leading up to the election, volunteers work with their neighbors to make individual vote plans. But while the neighborhood team model encourages civic engagement and gets out the vote effectively, it may stand in the way of intern pay.
Electoral campaigns at every level run on volunteer contributions, especially gargantuan presidential campaigns that can be paralyzed by recurring expenses. By paying an intern for performing tasks similar to those done by a volunteer, the campaign risks putting a price tag on the services provided by its neighborhood team members. This creates a circumstance in which the intern is paid and the volunteer is not, which could sap the altruistic motivation of volunteers. If intern compensation created volunteer attrition or a slump in volunteer productivity, the effects on a campaign could be fatal, so campaigns tend to avoid this risk entirely by not paying interns.
Furthermore, leadership on this issue is unlikely to come from campaigns — only one candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, pays his interns. This is because unproven interns are financial risks, too. Paying interns is unlikely to be cost-beneficial, as campaigns have short windows and limited capabilities to train and develop interns. After an election cycle ends, interns almost certainly will not wait around for two, four or six years for the candidate’s next election, so a candidate that pays interns is unlikely to reap the benefits on his or her risky investment.
However, by denying interns pay, campaigns incur other hidden costs. In the short term, campaigns depend less on low-income interns, disproportionately black and Latino students, who often cannot afford to work without pay. And by denying low-income students access to internships, these students become less likely to access entry-level political jobs and upper-level campaign positions.
In addition to obstructing diversity in politics, unpaid internships hurt the long-term hiring capabilities of political campaigns, because they do not offer the same “signal” as paid internships. Paid internships, which lead to employment much more consistently than unpaid internships, may more frequently offer a signal that interns are competent and represent a worthy investment.
Unpaid internships do not offer similar signals to employers, especially on campaigns. Since it costs almost nothing for an employer to bring on an unpaid intern, the employer has less of an incentive to provide development opportunities to interns, and intern work is often cursory. Therefore, hiring managers on political campaigns have little assurance that someone who worked as an unpaid intern on a prior campaign is any more competent than another entry-level candidate.
Political parties can fill this void. State parties employ full-time staff members that communicate the party platform and raise money between election cycles. During major cycles, state parties back candidates and contribute to their campaigns. State parties could fundraise for paid internship programs, increase contributions to candidates that pledge to compensate interns and directly fund party-managed internship programs.
By failing to pay interns, these organizations miss the chance to create a reliable talent pipeline while denying opportunities to low-income students. To broaden the talent pool and enhance the development of our future political leaders, political parties should commit to investing in interns.

He swept Super Tuesday by a landslide. His rallies echo with blunt fearmongering and fiery screaming. Media coverage swarmed his seemingly effortless consecutive victories. All this publicity and chatter and fire and momentum — and to think, he started out with only a small loan of a million dollars.
But there are several things that college-age voters need to know about the Trump Situation. Not all of them are laughable. Donald Trump is creating a schism within the GOP that, as his contenders fall further behind him in the Republican primary, is growing rapidly into an irreparable chasm. Ongoing allegations against his past business endeavors, most recently Trump University, underscore his selfish nature and lack of credibility. His lack of political experience — or legal training, at the very least — is only one of the many contributing factors to his ineptitude as a presidential candidate. Following his victories on Super Tuesday earlier this week, Trump is on a course for victory in the Republican primary — and if he wins, he will not only do lasting damage to the GOP and its traditional voter base, but also change the party balance for cycles to come. Put simply: Do not dismiss or underestimate the importance of derailing the Trump Situation.
As Americans everywhere begin to grapple with the prospect of a Trump administration, the businessman’s most recent scandal provides an example of what we might expect from his presidency. Since 2010, Trump has been embroiled in class-action lawsuits surrounding his real-estate “school,” Trump University, a for-profit training center for aspiring commercial real estate agents. The school made a variety of false commitments to its students and pressured them to enlist in exorbitantly expensive “elite” programs which would unlock these fabled doors to quick success. It continuously promised outlandish results for further payment, bullied students into expensive contracts and even went so far as to encourage students to make calls to their credit card companies in the hallways to increase their card limits. The school failed to deliver students their promised lessons, instead funneling them into “infomercial” sessions designed to advertise lecturers. Tuition costs came out at upwards of $36,000. Students received nothing but mountains of debt. Trump has since denied any wrongdoing.
Aside from obvious disgust at the idea of a president who scams college students for money, the Trump University suits also provide an apt metaphor for what a Trump presidency might look like: mountains of empty promises, a lack of understanding of the task at hand, a lack of results and in the end, mountains of debt. And Trump denies responsibility.
Even the GOP itself, though splitting, has been able to reach this conclusion. Due to greater pressure for radically conservative social policy, economic conservatives and moderates have been slowly disappearing from the Republican voter base. Party leadership cannot tie the wealthy elite, big business, the Tea Party’s anti-establishment anarchists and the old neo-conservative Bible Belt religious block back together into a party. Trump has done nothing but take this divide and turn it into an ocean. The fear is that traditional conservatives will abandon Trump and break with the radical strands of the party altogether. This would leave the new ranks of previously dormant racist-radical voters — currently boosting Trump’s turnout — to become the new support base. Once in office, big business will resent a president they cannot control. The religious bloc and social conservatives won’t identify with his mostly secular and selfishly motivated policy. Old elites will be even less comfortable with his representation of the Grand Old Party.
Here, we reach the crux of the Trump Situation: As the presidential race continues, the GOP leadership has been scrambling at luncheons and meetings to take this fractured party and put it behind someone else, like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, to have a viable candidate to get behind for the general election. Super Tuesday suggests they may not be able to do it.
So here’s where we find ourselves with the Trump Situation: He’s clearly no candidate for the country’s highest office. His own party has all but disowned him — and is scrambling for an alternative. But among the conservative wave, he’s winning the states that count. So, as the Trump Situation unfolds, remember: Do not dismiss Trump as some funny just-for-show celebrity politician that will be hilarious until we roll around to 2017 and need a real president. Trump cannot be allowed to represent any party — not even one as fractured and reactionary as the modern-day GOP. It’s time college-age voters became wary of the Trump Situation — and started acting to make his bid a cautionary tale rather than a long-lasting American regret. So turn out to the California primary in June — and not for Trump.
Lily Vaughan is a freshman majoring in history and political science. Her column, “Playing Politics,” runs  Fridays.
Contrary to the author’s uninformed and biased opinion, Donald Trump is a great American businessman whom thousands of Americans rightfully support for POTUS.  During the course of his lifetime, Trump has built over 500 major buildings and companies and taken entrepreneurial risks to create a commercial real estate and development empire that presently employs over 22,000 men and women worldwide.  Out of the thousands of businesses and transactions in which he has participated, a scant four – mainly in Atlantic City – have gone through Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which is a reorganization of the businesses, not liquidation of assets.  Thousands of successful businessmen have used the Bankruptcy Code to rebuild businesses, including Warren Buffet and Mitt Romney.  Given Trump’s proven track record for creating jobs, the author’s suggestion that Trump is a failed businessman is laughable and extraordinarily naïve, even considering the handful of relatively minor companies that have failed.  
Her simplistic rush to judgment regarding Trump University is equally pathetic, especially since this is a civil case where the only claims she makes are based upon unproven allegations taken from the complaint and snippets of witnesses whose credibility is questionable.  Even assuming Trump mislead the plaintiff class, a high bar in light of the credible facts that have surfaced, his seminars were far less egregious than the harm inflicted upon tens of thousands of students who have borrowed heavily to attend for-profit Phoenix University or Corinthian College, which defrauded thousands and for whom Marco Rubio lobbied heavily after receiving over $27,000 in campaign contributions; now that is an opposition research scandal just surfacing.
As college students, use your critical thinking skills to deconstruct the main stream media and pundits who claim to understand the anger of millions of Democrats and Republicans who are supporting Trump, including this well-educated but “low information” supporter.  Ignore the noise around you and look at his business record throughout the years, not disparate parts or even his seemingly bombastic statements that for the most part are grossly taken out of context.  Then make an informed decision based upon your own research, not the rants of those who are doing everything humanly possible to prevent their power from being swept away by an electorate whose purported leaders have betrayed them.
Dude relax, did you read how stupid her other articles have been? She’s a freshmen, cut her some slack. There is a reason people become more conservative as they get older. 
As a former DT staffer, I think anyone at USC should do their due diligence before putting pen to paper, period.

Knight of Cups, the latest film by American director Terrence Malick, is set for release on Friday. The movie began production in 2012 with a celebrated cast featuring Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett, yet little was known about the film or its content and fans were left speculating as to what sort of film it might be.
The final product debuted at the Berlin International Film festival, and audiences recognized it as a modern, experimental film. Rick (Bale) is the focus of the story as a wealthy screenwriter who suddenly feels his life has been estranged from purpose and meaning despite his success. The film flows in a series of chapters that are inspired by a particular tarot card, which play a role in the film and in its name. Each chapter focuses upon his relationship with someone important in his life, mostly women who have been romantic interests. Those cast in these roles, including Blanchett, Natalie Portman, Frieda Pinto and Isabel Lucas, have strong chemistry with Bale, whose character one must remember is lost and detached, especially considering their brief appearances.
The film’s most redeeming quality is the overarching aesthetic that coincides with the pacing of the film and Bale’s mysterious story. Malick’s efforts in capturing the scenery across Los Angeles could be an ideal montage for a tourism board — scenes take place in Hollywood, the mansions in the hills, the streets of downtown and midtown and the beaches along the coast. There are surreal and almost psychedelic sequences that turn areas of L.A. into reimagined works of art. Death Valley was the location of other shoots that cultivate Malick’s style and illustrate both Southern California and the national park’s great expanse. Perhaps to allude to a sense of emptiness and aimless adventure in Rick’s life, most scenes are shot in areas with great space and open area.
Despite this, Malick highlights the intimacy of all of Rick’s relationships with close shots that show deeper expression between the characters. Even in these scenes, the camera generally has sweeping motion and covers nearly a 360-degree perspective of the dialogue sequences. Many shots are of Bale’s character being introspective or staring off distantly while an off-screen voice of himself or another character speaking. What some may see  as lacking in story or dialogue is made up for in tension, ambience and setting by Malick, whose grandiose sequences in some environments offer minimalist exchanges between characters that say much more with few words.
Without bluntly claiming it at any point, a major theme of the film is the superficiality that Hollywood propagates. Rick is a victim of this and realizes it, yet his lovers in the film vary in their awareness of how they’ve become lost. They show great differences in their interests and occupations, from being socialites to medical care for the homeless. The ones who focus on material items cause him trouble. He harmed some of his relationships by falling into the lifestyle that he now tries to escape, and as glamorous as the film is at times, Bale’s character harbors many regrets and attempts to discover himself in a way that can speak to the audience.
Knight of Cups is certainly not everyone’s cup of tea. Yet one would be hard pressed to find a movie that better exhibits and connects certain relationships and exchanges to emotions. Malick creates flawed, realistic characters representative of the culture and climate we live in, and directs their awareness and ignorance of their own emptiness coupled with their search for connection and meaning flawlessly. Indulgent and impressionistic, viewers can expect an artistic treat from this film, one of the most visually appealing in recent memory.

It was the 8th grade, and I had no sense of fashion. I don’t mean that my style was different from what was popular — I mean that I genuinely had no style. My upper half (and ankles) were doused in ’80s influenced cotton while my butt swam within the baggy folds of denim in my mom jeans. My hair was either unbrushed or stuck to my forehead just above my coats of blue eyeliner.
He was a mousy nerd in the butterfly stage just before hipsterdom. He over-enthusiastically discussed The Office, adored Mumford & Sons before anyone knew them and drew portraits of the Flight of the Conchords lads in his spare time. For all intents and purposes, he was basically a jerk. But I found him a charming jerk, so I followed him around tennis camp and agreed with his every word. It was middle school love. But it was middle school love soundtracked. Most of our one-sided relationship involved me rapidly googling whatever musician he was telling me about so I could pretend I already knew them. I went from knowing the Top 100 and bopping along blindly to being well-versed in 2000s Brit-rock, alternative hip hop and dozens of other sub-genres that sound freakishly like street drugs.
I began as an ignorant student. Whatever he told me, I soaked up aggressively while batting my eyelashes. But soon, I delved into the depths of YouTube’s recommendations. I went from five minute delayed responses, to texts about The Wombats to preemptive suggestions of the next big thing in indie that he should check out. Suddenly, the music wasn’t just a means of flirting; it was a way of life. That boy and I never fell in love — sure, we made out a few times in high school, but the real love affair that began was between me and music. And it’s been intertwined with my life ever since.
Every good student must outgrow their teacher at some point. For me, it became an issue of going beyond just what the underground, hipster movement fed me and connecting with music of all genres. It’s a purpose that still fuels me to this day (something my boyfriend
wishes would change so I’d stop listening to Taylor Swift around him).
Everyone has their preferences. For me, I’m drawn most to surf rock and pop punk, but that doesn’t mean that is all I listen to. Music can be for contemplating life, finding strength and empowerment, dancing, waking you up, making you feel sexy, goofing off, crying and much more. The seriousness of its use doesn’t validate its existence. One of the biggest problems in music consumption is the notion that music must always mean something deep. No, scratch that. The biggest problem in music consumption is the notion that lighthearted and joyful uses aren’t deep.
The first time I ever realized this was when I pondered the differences between Bon Iver and Blink-182. Both are amazing, but those who love Bon Iver tend to argue that Blink-182 is frivolous and silly. I would argue that it takes just as much talent to be relatable and simple as it does to be poetic and drenched in metaphors. Don’t get me wrong, I love Blood Bank just as much as I love Reckless Abandon. The point being, I love them differently. Not more or less, just differently. I love Kesha just as much as I love the Clash because Kesha inspires me to dance and not care, whereas The Clash inspires me to consider everything from the exploitation of capitalism to issues of gambling and monetary obsession.
Of course some people don’t look for everything in music. For some people, music is just an excuse to dance or just a thought provoking art. That’s okay too. My point is that whatever music is to you, that’s okay. What’s not okay is to negate the importance of music in another person’s life because it differs from your own.

Americans will settle in for a bingefest of Netflix-and-House-of-Cards this weekend to watch Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood sabotage all those who stand in his way. Others will watch the plot unfold slowly, forcing themselves to watch one episode at a time (maybe two or three.)
Spacey captivated audiences with his performance in seasons one through three. House of Cards is the culmination of his acting career, yet it seems as if Robin Wright will capture viewer’s attention this time. In the closing scene of season three, Claire Underwood finally leaves her “Francis,” realizing that their relationship is one of duty rather than love. Of course, House of Cards fans would have seen this coming from a mile away in her relationship with Ben Daniels’ Adam Galloway, her forced enthusiasm for Frank’s campaign success and her lying on national television. It’s clear that she is done being a pawn in his power game.
The official trailer confirms that much of season four will be a battle between Claire and Frank.
“You have no idea what it means to have nothing,” Spacey said in a voiceover while the preview cuts to a standoff between Claire and Frank. “You don’t value what we have achieved. I have had to fight for everything my entire life.”
With that, we are bombarded with a montage of what is to come. We see Molly Parkers’ Jackie Sharp and Mahershala Ali’s Remy Danton in a lustful embrace, money exchanging hands, Elizabeth Marvel’s Heather Dunbar looking disgruntled as pages of names fill the screen, symbols of death, destruction and violence and parallels to the past.
The trailer foreshadows Frank Underwood’s slowly losing control and Claire sabotaging everything they had once tried to accomplish together. As the trailer comes to a close, it’s obvious that any hope of a future for Claire and Frank has already been destroyed. And House of Cards veterans should known that already; in the upside down world that the characters live in, nothing will ever last.
Netflix kept spoilers to a minimum up before the season’s  release Friday, keeping audience expectations high. Those who have followed House of Cards on Facebook have been salivating for the past month as they see more and more of what they love about the show.
Season four, which will be available for streaming as the Ides of March rolls up, is set to be the climax of the series, and through what has transpired in seasons one through three and what Netflix decided to divulge in the preview, the falling action has now begun.
We know what we are going to get based on our previous experience with House of Cards, but there is a hint that we will also get something new. Claire will become a more important part of the series, and instead of being on the same side as Frank it seems that she will now be against him. The audience will chose who they want to come up on top.
It’s team Frank versus team Claire now. We will have to see how they function without each other.

The USC women’s beach volleyball team kicked off the season with the Cardinal and Gold alumni match at Merle Norman Stadium on Thursday. 
Before the event started, a kick-off party was organized with donors and supporters.
Current athletes then paired up with alumni to play single-set matches to 21 points, giving the chance to young athletes to play each other in a generational clash.
Head coach Anna Collier talked about the excitement of having alumni coming back to play on the sand.
“It is so fun,” Collier said. “I’ve known all these players because I’ve played here. It’s so much fun because they’re competitive. You can see them out here going, ‘I’m going to win, I’m going to beat these girls,’ … But it’s really fun because It brings all the Trojan family back together.’”
Together with the fun, the athletes had the opportunity to receive advice from experienced players.
“It’s pretty amazing to see how far everybody has come after leaving here,” junior Nicolette Martin said. “I think it’s just an amazing experience to play with these players that are just so much more experienced than us, and we can learn a lot from them.”
Amongst the recent graduates, Meg Norton played three matches on Thursday.
“It feels good to be back,” she said. “It’s pretty fun trying to get the kinks out and playing with all the old girls, but it definitely feels like I haven’t played volleyball in a couple of months.” 
She was part of the 2015 squad who conquered the national title with a 28-0 undefeated season, and Norton believes this year’s team — ranked No. 1 entering the season — is primed for a strong campaign. 
“I think that they look really really strong this year,” Norton said. “They’re returning a lot of the girls and I know the girls who are returning have improved. I’m excited to see what they do in the season.”
Senior Alexa Strange played her last alumni mixer as student-athlete. In her last season, she will partner with junior Sophie Bukovec. 
“I think it’s starting to resonate with me that this is the last season, and my last time getting to compete with USC on my uniform,” Strange said. “It’s kind of a bittersweet feeling, but I realize I need to seize the moment and just enjoy while I’m here.”
Part of the Trojan family are also the 2012 Olympics silver medalists Jennifer Kessy and April Ross. They were not able to participate this year, as they are in Brazil to compete for a spot at the Games in Rio. They will play at the Rio Open (FIVB Grand Slam) starting on March 8th. Ross is partnering with 3-time gold medalist Kerri Walsh, while Jennifer Kessy is playing alongside Emily Day.

Let’s face it, going into freshman year you probably had no friends. The great thing about going into freshman year, though, is that no one else has any friends either  —  the handful of people from your high school and your roommate “bestie” that you met on Facebook don’t count. I distinctly remember the night before moving into my dorm, panicking that I would spend all of freshman year alone. The last time I had to make an entirely new friend group was when I moved schools going into sixth grade, and seven years later I wasn’t sure I remembered how to befriend a bunch of strangers. 
The reality of that fear, however, was that most other incoming freshmen were also panicking and would resolve to be the friendliest version of themselves on the first day in hopes of actually finding people that would tolerate, and even enjoy their presence. Everyone was in the same boat. The first few days of college were pretty much “How Do I Make Friends Again? 101.” 
Now, four years later as I prepare to make my move into the real world, I’m experiencing a version of that same pre-move-in-day panic attack. However, this time when I move to a new city, into a new apartment, there probably won’t be a group of “real world freshmen” anxiously awaiting my arrival, knocking on my door to strike up a conversation and to get to know their neighbor. So, this leaves me wondering, if I move to a city without a group of college or high school friends to lean on, how does one make friends in the real world?
After brainstorming with friends and even consulting some real-world post-grads themselves, here’s what I’ve come up with as the most likely, and least awkward, ways to make friends after you graduate college.
1. Mutual friends
 
Even if none of your best friends are moving to the same city as you are, there’s a good chance your sister’s boyfriend’s cousin lives there, and he or she might be nice enough to meet up for coffee and show you around. The world ends up being a pretty small place, and chances are you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone who lives in the same city as you. 
 
2. Join a gym 
 
Besides the fact that it will hopefully keep you in shape, going to the gym can become a routine, and when other people have the same routine as you, and you see them day in and day out in the same spin class, strike up a conversation. Plus, the pressure is off when you both look gross and sweaty.
3. Go to a dog park
 
OK, maybe this one is just me because I may end up being an old dog lady someday, but there’s no denying that dog people love to be dog people, together. “What breed is he?” easily leads into “You live in Culver City? Me too. What do you do?” Also, so this will probably only work if you actually have a dog — otherwise it might come off as a little weird.
4. Take a class or join a team
Regretting not taking a photography class during college? Miss being on your club soccer team? Now is your chance to do that, and to meet people who also want to take part in the same activities. Though the involvement fair doesn’t exist in the real world, it doesn’t mean you can’t find groups of people with interests that align with your own.

When you’re in a hungry mood between classes, it’s easy to want to satisfy your hunger with a sugary granola bar or with orange chicken from Panda Express. But if you’re looking for something substantial to eat, consider getting a “green-centric meal.” There are many ways to incorporate some greens into your diet right on campus. 
Seeds is one of my all-time favorite dining hubs to grab lunch or dinner at before I head to work. Their salad station offers guests with a menu of pre-selected salads as well as the option to create their own. One of the best things is the customizability; you can add certain ingredients to add nutrition benefits and you can even swap out your mixed greens or iceberg lettuce for kale! Although I didn’t think I was a fan of kale, I switched to it from iceberg lettuce when getting the cobb one day and asked for ranch dressing. The pieces were cut to chewable size, and I found the kale to add great depth and flavor and it made me fill up sooner.

If you head upstairs directly above Seeds, you’ll be greeted with a great variety of seasonal favorites. Lemonade is a great dining option if you want a small portion or if you want a little bit of everything. It’s great that they switch out and mix up their salad specials section on a regular basis to accommodate for seasonal veggies and students wanting something new. They offer kale here too in some salads, and practically everything from an arugula and pear salad to one of my favorites: shaved brussel sprouts. Again, I didn’t think I was a fan of brussel sprouts but Lemonade’s additions and light vinaigrette really makes it a great and healthy dish to snack on.

But wait, this is an acai bowl place, right? Correct, but Nekter also offers students with a menu of juices and smoothies. Not a fan of spinach or kale? Then this is the option for you. Although smoothies can be high in sugar content, they’re a great way to sneak in some vitamins and greens into your diet here and there. Their tropical cooler smoothie for example comes with fresh spinach and kale and is masked by pineapple, banana and coconut. The first juice on their list is actually called “the greenie” as it is a juice made from parsley, spinach, kale, celery, cucumber, apple, and lemon. Those sure are a lot of greens and nutrients in one drink!

And last but certainly not least, are the beloved dining halls. Each of the dining halls is equipped with some version of a salad bar, and I must applaud USC Hospitality for the variety of greens, toppings and dressings available to students. Before you head for a burger and fries or whatever concoction the dining halls are serving for dinner, why not get a plate of customized salad first? Plus, there’s sometimes chopped bacon in those bars as well.
Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
It’s so easy to forget to eat healthy foods and get your intake of greens especially when they aren’t exactly the tastiest. Instead of picking up fast food or something sugary to satisfy your cravings, consider getting a big filling salad from seeds or the dining halls, a hand-crafted seasonal salad from Lemonade to snack on or even a juice or smoothie to sip on during class to get your share of greens for the day!

Running is my preferred method of exercise for a number of reasons: A) you can do it almost anywhere, B) it’s a great way to spend time outdoors and C) it’s always better with music. Realistically, any kind of music will do whenever you’re running. It all depends on your personal preference. Some people can really get the endorphins flowing when Claude Debussy is keeping the beat just as easily as those who prefer having Skrillex drop all kinds of bass as they hit the pavement.
For me, though, I have a personal method of listening to music that can be outlined in four simple phases:
Phase One: Watch Out, Usain Bolt
Phase One is, obviously, when I start my run. I usually like to put a classic or favorite of mine on, usually with a really simple structure or hook to get the blood pumping and raise my spirits. It’s nothing too intense but a little something to get me started. Pretty much anything that makes me feel like I’m on top of the world and nothing can stop me earns a spot in phase one because I’m not going to be feeling too hot soon.
Phase 2: Wait, I’m Only Halfway Done?
Once I hit Phase 2, I’m starting to feel the burn a little bit. My breathing is getting quicker, sweat is starting to drip and my legs are starting to hate me. At this point, a simple hook or melody isn’t enough, and my songs need to have something with a little more kick to them or anything that makes me pay attention to the music and not how tired I’m getting. Anything with a little bit of oomf to it that can force me to focus on what’s happening in the song and not worry about my breathing technique is fair game for Phase 2, but it can’t be too wild. Then comes in…
Phase 3: Why Did I Do This To Myself
At this point, I’m usually a wheezing mess that feels like running in a straight line is an achievement worth of an Olympic medal. It’s also usually around this time that I experience a runner’s high, which is awful when you’re listening to music. Every song in your collection suddenly sounds way slower than you remembered it being. Every ten seconds feels like ten minutes, and ten more minutes of running feels like a cruel joke at this point. Every song in this phase should be hyped up and intense.
Phase 4: Eh, I’ve Had Worse
Congratulations. It’s over. Time to stretch and cool down with a nice and relaxing walk. These songs are more chilled out, but not chill enough to bring me down from the runner’s high. This is definitely my favorite phase, since I feel like I’ve accomplished something, even if my run was laughably bad. But hey, a little exercise is better than no exercise, right?

Just a few weeks ago, I decided to visit one of the classics: Primo’s Donuts. Hailed “The Best in LA Since 1956” by Food & Wine Magazine, Primo’s is known for its traditional, hometown donut shop feel. It is located in a rather random area in Westdale that you could easily drive past if you’re not looking closely, but locals who know Primo’s know where it is and that it’s the place to go for an affordable and convenient donut fix.
The shop is really small, but the selection was definitely large! I noticed that they had a lot of cinnamon rolls so I’m assuming it’s one of their trademarks. Usually when I’m visiting a new place, I like to try the most popular option because it must be popular for a reason. That said, the first donut I ordered was the Cinnamon Butterfly — which is their signature flavor. I was satisfied with the taste and can see why it’s a pleasant, comforting choice to order as a frequent visitor, but I personally did not find anything extraordinary about it.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
I visited Primo’s just a few days before Super Bowl 50, so they were selling “Super Bowl Super Jellies” — donuts in the shape of a football. I really appreciate seasonal flavors, especially if they’re decorated to match a theme or a holiday, so I’d like to give Primo’s Donuts a gold star for creativity! This was also my favorite donut on this trip because of the jelly filling. Over time — after you’ve been eating so many donuts — you begin to notice the small variances in jelly sweetness, and I have to say, this donut had a sweetness factor that was spot on!
And finally, because this is a classic donut place, I ordered one of their classic cake donuts with chocolate frosting. I thought the dough was a bit dry, but it seemed to work out and was a nice version of the traditional cake donut.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Overall, I would recommend trying Primo’s Donuts only if you are in the area or if you’re touring several places in LA for donuts. Though they proudly display their recognition as “The Best in LA since 1956,” it’s been a long time since they opened, and during that time, many new and trendy places have been established throughout L.A. To keep their title, they’re going to have to step up their game, because — as I’ve become aware through my L.A. donut adventures — there is some serious competition out there!
Primo’s Donuts is open Mondays through Fridays from 5:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturdays from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Sundays from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 2918 Sawtelle Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90064.

Coming back home to Galen Center seemed  to make all the difference for USC Wednesday night in a 81-70 win over the Oregon State Beavers.
With the victory, USC (20-10, 9-8) breaks a three-game losing streak and advances to 16-1 at home.
Head coach Andy Enfield stated how proud he was of his team’s effort not only against Oregon State in the first half, but also during USC’s first 20-win season since 2009.
“We knew it would be a battle. I’m proud of our players to come out in the first half and play well,” Enfield said. “For this group to win 20 games, it’s special … The thing that makes me most proud of this team is they’ve developed as a unit. They’ve done a great job of fighting through the adversities.”
Sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin lit up the scoreboard with a team-high 17 points while accumulating nine assists and one steal. Freshman forward Bennie Boatwright returned to hit five of his eight 3-point attempts and pulled down six rebounds.
The story of the night was a resurgent USC defense, which bounced back nicely after allowing both Stanford and Cal to win by an average margin of 21 points.
Redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt illustrated the improved play of the Trojans and how redshirt junior forward Darion Clark’s return to the lineup was much needed.
“[The first half] felt great. Everybody was sharing the ball, knocking shots down,” Reinhardt said. “[Clark] is a monster. Just the energy, the way he talks. He competes every day in practice. Every time the ball goes up, you see him trying to get the rebound … It’s a sparkplug. Every team needs that.”
The Men of Troy allowed just 70 points off of 42.2 percent shooting from the Beavers, giving up just 38.9 percent of shots from beyond the arc.
Instead of the Trojans starting out hot, it was the Beavers who gained an early advantage after hitting four-straight 3-point shots to go up 12-7 with just three minutes gone by.
The Trojans, however, were able to build a strong lead thanks to clutch 3 shooting from McLaughlin and Boatwright, who were a combined 4-of-5 in the first 10 minutes.
A surprising scratch from the starting lineup, Reinhardt was impeccable in the first half, shooting 4-4 from the floor, including two 3s to go along with USC’s 8-11 shooting from deep.
Oregon State was relatively quiet in the final ten minutes of the first half as two of the Beavers top scorers, Gary Payton and Stephen Thompson, Jr., were held to just 8 combined points.
By the end of 20 minutes, the Trojans were in position for a should-be victory, holding a 56-33 advantage.
The second half was more of the same for the Men of Troy as the Trojans extended their lead to 23 three times.
After 40 minutes of game time had elapsed, the Trojans amassed four double-digit scorers, with McLaughlin’s 17 leading the way.
“We’ve got to come out with the same intensity that we do as if it was a home game,”  McLaughlin said of USC’s mentality going into the Pac-12 tournament. “We’ve got to just turn it around,”
The Trojans’ final home game of the regular season will take place Saturday at 1:00 p.m. against the No. 9 Oregon Ducks.

The Women of Troy are set in Seattle for the beginning of the Pac-12 tournament. USC is the eighth seed in the tournament and will be facing the ninth-seeded Washington State on Thursday night.
The Trojans (18-12, 6-12) and the Cougars (14-15, 5-13) split their season series during the regular season with each team protecting its home court. In Pullman, the Women of Troy fell 61-73 but pulled off a two-point win 64-62 at home in the middle of February.
The win was USC’s last having gone 0-4 since defeating WSU. The Trojans fell on the road to both Oregon schools and were defeated at home by both Arizona schools to finish the season. USC matched its best start in program history after going 12-0, even earning the NCAA’s award for Team of the Week when they hit the 9-0 mark in December.
If the Women of Troy beat WSU in the first round, they will play top-seed Oregon State. The Beavers, who were awarded a first-round bye, are the No. 8 team in the country and have a 25-4 record.
If the Trojans are to have a successful run in the tournament, they will need to channel its mentality from two years ago. In 2014, USC brought home their first ever conference title in coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s first season. The Women of Troy were the No. 5 seed that season and became the first team in tournament history to have to play four games during the four-day event as well as the first team to win all four.
Last season the Trojans came into the tournament as a No. 8 seed and were upset in the first round by No. 9-seeded Colorado.
This year, the Women of Troy are No. 58 in the country in RPI. The high point of the season was a 71-68 win over then-No. 15 UCLA in early January. The Trojans broke into the national rankings at No. 25 after the win but fell out again by the end of January.
Two key players heading into the tournament are senior forward Temi Fagbenle and junior guard Courtney Jaco. Earlier in the week Fagbenle was named first-team All Pac-12 and Jaco earned Honorable Mention honors.
Fagbenle is shooting 52 percent from the field and is averaging 14 points per game to go along with nine rebounds per game.  Fagbenle ranks No. 50 in the country in field goal percentage and No. 55 in total rebounds after grabbing 254 over the course of the season.
Jaco is the Trojans 3-point specialist and she is averaging just under 10 points a game scoring. She leads the team in threes made this season with 66, a new career-high for her. The number is also good enough to land her at fifth on the list of most threes made in a season by a USC player.
Defense is something that the Women of Troy have been strong in over the course of the season, and it will need to continue as long as they hope to keep their postseason hopes alive. USC gives up just 58 points a game and is 14th in the country in steals averaging over 10 a game. The Trojans are also forcing their opponents into nearly 20 turnovers a game.
The first round matchup is slated for tipoff at 6 p.m. from Key Arena in Seattle. The Pac-12 Network will broadcast the first three rounds of the tournament and the championship game on Sunday will be televised on ESPN.

USC senior diver Collin Pollard had his personal best conference championships performance to date last week to earn Pac-12 Diver of the Month honors.
This is Pollard’s second award of the season and USC’s fifth all-time.
Pollard won his first-ever conference title on the platform, finishing with a score of 427.70. He finished second on the one-meter and fifth on the three-meter. His scores allowed the Trojans to come into this week’s Pac-12 swimming championships tied for the lead with Stanford.
Pollard’s success against USC’s rivals to the north also contributed to his Diver of the Month selection — his victories in the one-meter against Cal and Stanford helped push USC to victories against both schools; the Trojans hadn’t swept their Bay Area opponents in a single season since 1997.
Last year, Pollard made his first appearance at the NCAA Championships, where he finished 11th on the one-meter and the platform, and he will have the opportunity to return this season, beginning with the Zone E Championships next week.

Giving his two cents · Unlike his predecessor, USC President C.L. Max Nikias has not been shy with managing athletics at the university.Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
As Athletic Director Pat Haden prepares to retire in June, a vacancy opens for one of the country’s most renowned posts in college sports. A national search firm has been employed and an advisory committee has been assembled in order to help find the University’s next head of athletics, but ultimately, President C. L. Max Nikias will be faced with the difficult task of selecting that very someone, giving him a significant amount  of leverage in the competitive arms race that is intercollegiate athletics for the time being.
Nikias, who has served in the capacity of the University’s chief executive since August 2010, has actually been wheeling and dealing in the college football landscape for quite some time now, further expanding USC’s athletic footprint and influence among the nation’s top universities.
Most recently, Nikias was named the chairman of the College Football Playoff Board of Managers. Prior, he was the only president or chancellor of a Pac-12 school to sit on the board, which governs the business affairs of the College Football Playoff, overseeing budgets, policies and other operating guidelines. He chairs a board comprising of 11 total university presidents and chancellors.
“Dr. Nikias has been instrumental in the development and growth of the College Football Playoff,” Bill Hancock, executive director of the College Football Playoff said when making the announcement back in January.
While USC wasn’t in Glendale, Arizona, for the most recent national championship game, Nikias was, meeting with other College Football Playoff officials, including selection committee member and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. After being elected chairman of the Board of Managers, Nikias was pictured with Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott.
Ever since Haden stepped down from the selection committee back in October, mainly due to health reasons, it seems like Nikias has been the mouthpiece for USC’s voice in those national conversations regarding the College Football Playoff, a place where head coach Clay Helton and the Trojans hope to find themselves for the first time ever in the coming years.
For his extensive work on the playoff board, in addition to his pretty considerable involvement and investment in USC Athletics, Nikias deserves a lot of credit. Most university presidents or chancellors don’t exert themselves at half the capacity that Nikias has during his tenure thus far. At almost every USC football game or basketball game, you can find him on the sidelines many times  sporting his cardinal-and-gold cap.
With USC’s rich, athletic history and tradition, one would think that playing a significant role in athletics should almost be a prerequisite to the job, but Nikias has gone to greater lengths than I think most would have expected him to. He has also been much more involved than former president Steven Sample was with former athletic director Mike Garrett, based on what I’ve heard around Heritage Hall.
Of course, Nikias was the man who offered Haden his current job before he was even inaugurated as president during the summer of 2010. It was then that Nikias also appointed Dave Roberts to Vice President of  USC’s athletic compliance department, which was the first position of its kind at the time and has since played a great role in assuring that the University and its student-athletes stayed out of trouble after the NCAA controversially handed down sanctions.
Looking back, that was the beginning of rebuilding all of the pieces to an intricate puzzle that was almost completely dismantled by the hypocritical governing body. Haden gets most of the credit for USC being able to put that puzzle back together, though at times it seemed like one or two pieces had to be missing. He is also presented with the misfortune of dealing with all of the backlash and criticism. All in all, though, Nikias has also been there at his side almost every step of the way.
A lot of times, Haden would refer to Nikias as his sounding board when making difficult decisions, especially most recently when the football program had a head coaching vacancy due to some unfortunate circumstances.
According to Haden, Nikias would usually start off by saying, “I don’t know anything about football, but …”, before going on to provide some helpful guidance.
“Over the past six years, he has given me a lot of great advice,” Haden said at Helton’s introductory press conference back in November. There, Nikias sat alongside his right-hand man Haden, as they watched Helton give his opening remarks.
Perhaps Nikias’ most important next move is finding someone to replace the man he gave so much responsibility in to turn around the athletics program six years ago.
There’s no doubt that it’s a decision that will either be widely praised or criticized, perhaps based on whether the new hire has ties to USC or not. Regardless, it just goes to show how much effect Nikias has and will continue to have on athletics at USC and beyond.

The men’s volleyball team will play a road-and-home series against No. 15 Cal Baptist on Thursday and Saturday. On Thursday, the Trojans (3-13, 3-11) will head out to Riverside to take on the Lancers (8-11, 3-11), and USC will host them at the Galen Center on Saturday. The Trojans and Lancers are tied in MPSF standings.
The Trojans are coming off of losses to No. 9 UC Santa Barbara (17-10, 13-9 MPSF) and rivals No. 4 UCLA (15-3, 11-3 MPSF). Against the Bruins, junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder led all hitters with 17 kills, while boasting a team-high .516 hitting percentage. Despite the personal success, Yoder cared more about his team.
“I don’t care [about the performance],” Yoder said. “We lost.”
It is that team mentality that has been consistent for Troy all season. Through the ups and downs and the unforgiving record, head coach Jeff Nygaard has kept a positive outlook on the team’s resilience to play for each other, but there’s still a piece missing on the court.
“This team absolutely needs [a leader]. We need one guy to step up for a season,” Nygaard said. “Once we have that [guy], we’re in a better place.”
When a player has a standout night, like Yoder against UCLA, that helps the team out, but when it isn’t consistent, there’s no concrete way for the team to grow from it.
“You don’t step up for a day, you step up for a season,” Nygaard said.
Before the Santa Barbara loss, the Trojans had an eight-day break between matches. The team took some of its time off to bond together.
“They came back and were mentally cleansed,” Nygaard said. “There was way more team chemistry from that trip, so moving forward, we are looking at implementing a lot more team bonding.”
It’s been a common theme all season that Nygaard sees much more potential and success for his team than what its record reflects.
“We have the ability in our gym to control whatever happens on the other side of the net,” Nygaard said.
But while the team has the ability, they aren’t doing it consistently enough and that reflects in their record, according to Nygaard.
In the series against CBU, Nygaard is looking for his team to play at the potential he knows that they can.
“I’m looking for the team to reset, refocus, reenergize and come out and win two matches,” Nygaard said.
Nygaard’s mentality is just one of the aspects that has kept the Trojans optimistic despite the challenges they’ve faced this season.
“It’s been a tough season, but it’s a privilege to represent USC, so we know that we have to battle every day,” Yoder said. “We know we have a chance to beat every opponent we play. Our team is not lacking in anything, we’re just not getting the results we desire.”
The Trojans still have 11 matches left before the MPSF Tournament. The team has time to hit their stride and make something out of their season.
“Of course I want to make the playoffs. I want to do some damage while I’m in the playoffs,” Nygaard said. “We’re going to maintain that mentality and continue on that path. I absolutely believe that’s possible.”
Before they can think about the playoffs though, they’ll have to first focus on sweeping the Lancers. Both teams are currently on a losing streak, USC with two losses and CBU with four.
A strong offensive performance should help carry the Trojans to victory over the Lancers.
The series will start at Riverside on Thursday night at 7 p.m. and then come back to Los Angeles Saturday night at 7 p.m.
