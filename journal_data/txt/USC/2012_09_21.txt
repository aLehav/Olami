Apple has been up to a lot recently.
In addition to releasing the iOS 6 update with a revamped map and a “do not disturb” option, Apple has people clawing to get the new iPhone 5, so much so that pre-orders for the iPhone 5 sold out in less than an hour of its public unveiling.
This begs the question: Is it worth it to get an iPhone 5? For many Apple users, the answer is obvious. For others, it is natural to be a little skeptical about purchasing a new iPhone, even if it is the most updated version (for the time being, anyway).
If you currently own an iPhone 4S, it might not make a lot of sense to buy an iPhone 5, but e-commerce websites such as eBay and Amazon are offering cash and gift cards for your phones.
Still not convinced? The iPhone 5 comes with some fairly high-tech features. For one, the iPhone 5 will utilize the iCloud for wireless access from all computers and mobile devices.  A new processor, the A5, uses power more efficiently and increases the phone’s processing speed. You can also take vivid panoramic photos with the iPhone 5’s updated camera features.  And if you haven’t heard already, the iPhone 5 is a little thinner and a little wider than the iPhone 4S.
Then again, even though Apple consistently meets the standards of its clientele with its range of iPhone products and wields the most influence with its brand name, the iPhone 5 may not be the best choice in terms of smartphones.
For example, the Samsung Galaxy S III has a longer maximum battery life and a much larger screen. If you’re looking for something more affordable, the HTC One X costs half as much as an iPhone 5.
Regardless, purchasing a smartphone is a matter of personal preferences. If you keep the phrase “keeping up with the Joneses” near and dear to your heart, you might as well upgrade to a sleek and new iPhone 5. But if you’re unfazed by stylish phones and current trends, then it wouldn’t hurt to look into other phones. Who knows? You may fall in love with the phone you least expected to even notice.
Factual Inaccuracies:
(A) iCloud is a software feature that is also accessible on the iPhone 4 and 4S, as well as the 4th and 5th generation iPod Touches and the 2nd and 3rd generations of iPad.  Earlier generations may work too, but I haven’t personally confirmed as much yet.
(B) The OLD chip was the A5: variations were included in the iPhone 4 and 4S as well as the 3rd generation iPad and several other lesser-known Apple products (i.e. – the 3rd gen Apple TV).  The NEW chip is called the A6.
(C) Panorama pictures can still be taken with previous iPhones using free third-party apps.  Furthermore, the hardware camera on the iPhone 5 is nearly identical to the hardware camera on the iPhone 4S, with the only major difference being the sapphire coating on the outer lens.  
Even though I personally enjoy more complex technology (i.e. – Linux), I realize that Apple’s niche is that it makes its products aesthetically elegant and easy-to use.  That’s Apple’s selling point; you can try to be a hipster and bust on Apple for being undeservedly popular, but the reality is that they make products with pretty solid internals that look good and “just work” – and THAT is how it markets and sells its products.  I do NOT think an iPhone is right for everyone, but I do disagree with this hit-job piece riddled with inaccuracies that makes the iPhone 5 look like a product that people would only buy to appear “cool.”
Why would this even be published? This article is wrong on so many levels. The A5 chip? Wider? Use Google or god forbid run out to an Apple store and actually see one to compare. Perhaps the iPhone 5 has too many ‘fairly high-tech’ features for you to understand.
I was going to say something, but Face Palm already did…
Maybe you should actually do research before posting an article that’s half wrong

DirecTV subscribers in Southern California will be unable to tune into Saturday’s football game between No. 13 USC and the Cal Golden Bears.
DirecTV and the Pac-12 Networks could not come to an agreement on a deal to broadcast the new channel, which launched on August 15. The Pac-12 Networks were given the exclusive rights to show the USC against Cal and Utah versus Arizona State games on Saturday.
The satellite television provider claims it offered the Pac-12 Networks two separate options to show the USC game for this coming weekend as both sides continue to work out a deal. The first option, according to The Orange County Register, would be a stand-alone channel for subscribers. The second option would be a pay-per-view system for select football games.
“[The] Pac 12 rejected both without any consideration, demanding nothing less than a significant price and the express condition that all of our DirecTV customers pay for this channel whether they are interested or not,” stated DirecTV in a press release.
Pac-12 Networks recently came to a deal with Dish Network, which joins Comcast, Time Warner Cable, NCTC and a host of lesser known cable providers that show the new sports channel.
USC faces off against Cal at 3 p.m. The Golden Bears are coming off a close 35-28 loss to the No. 16 Ohio State Buckeyes.

College is important. If you grow up in a certain demographic, you are taught almost from birth that it is the most important step on the path to success in life.
Last weekend, however, the 2012 College Fair in Irvine attracted Korean families with children as young as 10 years old, begging the question: can you ever be too young to start preparing for college?
No—as long as preparation remains casual in the younger years. Lots of children are exposed to college early. They grow up hearing about it and are exposed to it in the media. Maybe their parents put aside a few dollars a week in a special bank—their “college fund.”
But for most kids, college remains a relatively abstract concept until they hit high school. They know nothing of the rigor and stress associated with getting into a good college; words like SAT, ACT and personal statement simply aren’t in their vocabulary.
And for good reason. College prep might encourage kids to take their studies, ambitions and extracurricular activities seriously from an early age. However, push elementary school kids too hard and you risk not only robbing them of their childhood, but also endangering the goal you are trying to reach.
By the time most of us start applying for college, we are ready—precisely because we have had our fill of relaxation. But someone who has been worrying about college since the age of 10 starts the application process with seven years of built up anxiety. When it comes to crunch time, he or she might just crack completely under the strain.
While some might view the fair in Irvine as a manifestation of the stereotypical Asian American overachiever, such helicopter parenting is a trait that crosses cultural lines. Plenty of non-Asian parents push their kids too hard. But the need to avoid these excesses crosses cultural lines as well.
Visiting a college fair is an innocent step in the college preparation process, but young children shouldn’t be expected to do much beyond this casual exploration of possibilities. Kids should be kids, and college students should be college students.

It is our responsibility to break the cycle of hatred, said Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation as he welcomed spectators to “Mind Over Media: Politics, Propaganda, and the Digital Age,” a panel discussion in Doheny Library on Thursday night.
Politics · Panelists discuss the power of political propaganda throughout American history. – Joanne Lin | Daily Trojan
Panelists discussed the role of propaganda in American politics and also how propaganda was used by the Nazi Party. The experts then explored ways in which new technologies, such as social media, affect political messaging.
The panel featured Steven Luckert, curator of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Permanent Exhibition, Eli Attie, a screenwriter for shows, including The West Wing, Tom Waldman, director of communications and media relations at Los Angeles Unified School District, and Nancy Snow, an adjunct professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
The panel was co-moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Daniel Rothberg, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel began by addressing how the Nazi party used political propaganda in Germany, analyzing several images, including a presidential campaign poster for Adolf Hitler.
After talking about Nazi propaganda, the discussion shifted to a consideration of how information is presented and disseminated in American politics. The panel also addressed how the media can change a voter’s perception of a particular fact.
After the event, some students said the panel encouraged them to consider information from different perspectives.
“I want to be more informed about [the upcoming election] and make sure I look at everything from all different angles,” said Sarah Frendewey, a junior majoring in vocal performance.
