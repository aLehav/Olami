The newly elected leaders of the Graduate Student Government plan to select their new committee members by April 22, on track to meet plans to increase the organization’s on-campus presence next year.
On March 4, Melody Shekari was elected GSG president, Victoria Pinto was elected vice president and Megan Yardley was elected Health Science Campus director.
Shekari, a juris doctorate candidate at the Gould School of Law and the current director of elections and recruitment, said she wants to work with the administration to address funding issues, increase financial transparency and implement more consistent programming for graduate students during her term.
“Family programming is huge,” Shekari said. “A lot of graduate students have families, so having events on weekends that kids can go to is definitely a major goal.”
Shekari said she has specific plans to accomplish these programming goals, including the creation of family-friendly progamming, such as bowling nights, carnivals and community service.
Shekari said one of her main goals is to make immediate visible changes by creating a new GSG website to serve as a resource for graduate students.
“The current website is an old system,” Shekari said. “It doesn’t look good and it’s hard to manage, so one thing I’m trying to create is a new finance website to make it easier for students to apply for funding.”
Shekari said she wants to implement a monthly Grad Bar, during which graduate students from schools in the area can come together and socialize. In addition, Shekari said she wants to start a weekly happy hour for graduate students, an expansion of the current monthly happy hour for students.
“Our goal is to have a place where grad students can go every week and just enjoy themselves,” Shekari said.
Pinto said her main priority is to continue improving communication between GSG and its constituents.
“We represent families, veterans and a large number of international students,” Pinto said. “We want to make sure we are reaching out to the diverse student body that we serve.”
In addition, Pinto said she would like to increase GSG’s presence on campus through more frequent programming and the establishment of GSG traditions.
Yardley said her focus will be to expand on the work she is currently doing as Health Science Campus director to serve the needs of the HSC. She said she wants to improve interaction between HSC and the University Park Campus, including the implementation of a tram service on weekends, improving the intercampus shuttle system between the two campuses and expanding the subsidized Metro TAP program.
Yardley said she wants to increase ties with the community through service opportunities and by working to implement a HSC Master Plan, which will focus on addressing the unique needs of students at the HSC.
“We have more limited resources compared to UPC,” Yardley said. “So we have to be more strategic about how we use them to best serve the student population.”
Overall, Yardley said she is optimistic for the upcoming term.
“Stronger directors means stronger programming,” Shekari said. “We’ve definitely seen a lot of improvement.”

USC students got an inside look into the real world of the pornographic business on Thursday at An Evening with the Adult Film Industry.
Sex star · Adult film actor Ron Jeremy discusses Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy to a full crowd Thursday in the Ray Stark Family Theatre. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Held in The Ray Stark Family Theatre at the School of Cinematic Arts, USC students filled every seat in the auditorium and stood against the walls to watch Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy. The event also included a discussion afterward from “the legend” himself, along with the founder and co-chairman of Vivid Entertainment, Steven Hirsch, and adult film actress Allie Haze.
The event was put on by Cinematheque 108 in conjunction with the Picturing the Popular speaker series, with the aim of helping the audience to better understand the successes of the adult film industry.
The 2001 documentary feature about Jeremy exposed his journey from being “a ham” growing up in Queens, New York, to being an internationally famous porn star with a career that has lasted over 20 years.
During the question-and -answer discussion after the screening, Jeremy showed off his humor, jokingly saying, “I always lean forward, because I have more chins than a Chinese phone book.”
Jeremy said in both the documentary and discussion that his dream is to make it into mainstream film, but he said the stigma of pornography has hindered this success.
Jeremy said he had an opportunity to start a career in porn after a naked picture of him was published, which led to his first job offer in adult film. He said he initially hesitated, but admitted to himself, “Well, heck! I’m sleazy. Why not?”
Clement Cheng, a first year graduate student in the Peter Stark Producing Program, said Jeremy might push the envelope but noted he does not find it offensive. Instead, Cheng views Jeremy as a product of his industry.
“I think his image is sort of a cultivation of his experiences and is being used sort of as a commodity,” Cheng said. “He’s Ron Jeremy the porn star, not the actor.”
Moreover, Cheng said he is happy USC hosted the event so that students could learn and discuss a topic that is often considered taboo.
“You don’t see a lot of films that talk on this subject,” Cheng said. “For me, it gave me a perspective into an industry that people are often too afraid to talk about.”
The event also looked at Hirsch, who has been credited as helping grow the adult film industry into what it is today. In a discussion mediated by David Lerner, a Ph.D. candidate in critical studies, Hirsch said that the industry was something that was always a part of him since he was heavily influenced by his father, Fred Hirsch.
“I sort of grew up in the industry,” Hirsch said. “It was sort of the family business so I always expected from day one that we [Vivid Entertainment] would be the biggest and best company.”
Jelena Grozdanich, a junior majoring in communication, said the event helped her see multiple sides to the industry.
“The event definitely opened up my eyes to something that is more legitimized than what you might initially think,” Grozdanich said. “I think that at a school like USC, we try to expose a student to everything to create an intellectual conversation to see both sides to one of the greatest controversies.”
Ashley Warner, a junior majoring in communication, said that regardless of how an individual feels about pornography, one should at least strive to learn about the subject from multiple perspectives.
“It’s a taboo and no one really wants to talk about it,” Warner said. “But the least we can do is to try to understand and educate ourselves about an industry that seems to only be growing bigger.”
“showed off his humor”? you spelled racism wrong.
Did anybody bother to ask Ron if he can still perform fellatio on himself?

Students have partnered with a pair of professors who recently launched a new project to confront the global water crisis, which has left nearly 800 million people without access to safe drinking water.
Professor Massoud Pirbazari, a water purification expert, joined professor Thieo Hogen-Esch, as well as Hogen-Esch’s team at the USC Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute, to help improve the water supply for people around the world deprived of access to clean water. According to Water.org, more than 3 million people die each year of water-related diseases, with nearly all of these deaths occurring in the developing world.
Viv Pitter, a senior majoring in environmental engineering who worked on this initiative, said impure water has the potential to affect entire communities.
“Just because you contract one disease doesn’t mean you won’t contract another. And because they are in the water, diseases can affect entire communities,” Pitter said.
The current method of water purification involves running water over a thin membrane that removes impurities in the water. However, these membranes can clog frequently, requiring high-energy input and are often rendered unusable.
“In order to make [the membranes] cost-effective and usable, you have to somehow scientifically modify the membrane to make them less prone to clogging and fouling,” Pirbazari said. “Even just 20 percent less energy would be very attractive to the water industries.”
Pirbazari also stressed the importance of water purification other than filtration. He particularly noted desalination, the process of removing salt from the water supply.
“It doesn’t have to be seawater desalination, it could be desalination for water reuse to turn it into drinking water,” Pirbazari said. “It is also for agricultural purposes. It is useful for practically everything. You can take wastewater and further treat it for irrigation.”
Kirsten Rice, a senior majoring in environmental and mechanical engineering, expressed optimism at increasing the availability of water filtering technology. While working with Pirbazari, Rice was able to design a water filter constructed out of sand and gravel. In tests, the filter was able to remove nearly all of a harmful bacteria and three-quarters of the element arsenic contained in the water.
With the water crisis being most serious in developing countries, Rice described the importance of creating simple mechanisms, such as her sand and gravel filter, particularly as the global population grows and water resources are further strained.
“Taking something as simple as sand and gravel [is important] because it can be applied all over the world without an economic cost,” Rice said.
Yet Rice also noted that simply being able to purify water is not enough to confront the water crisis.
“There’s still a limited amount of water — it has to be imported,” Rice said. “There’s greater demand. We need to work on conserving water.”
Pirbazari has been heavily involved in engaging undergraduate students in research. Both Pitter and Rice described their work with him on water purification as very rewarding. Rice said that Pirbazari encouraged undergraduate students to take a leading role in carrying out research.
“Dr. Pirbazari wanted his undergrads to become involved in their own research. We designed our own experiments, recorded our own data and analyzed our results,” Rice said. “We worked together as a team with Dr. Pirbazari.”
According to Pirbazari, it is important for youth to recognize the significance of this water crisis.
“Young people really have to know this and further their understanding of this very important issue,” Pirbazari said.
I can agree that we all need some kind of water filtration system, but the method described above will never be implemented in countries that really need it as the method above sounds like reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis would be too energy intensive and costly for it to be implemented in those countries.
Though I agree with the article, the mentioned designs seem to be lacking in any ingenuity.  These are pre and post graduates, they should be coming up with more than gravel and sand for filtration.  In the professional side of water treatment we call this a multimedia filter, physically removes down to around 25 microns and can catch a number of bacteria, at the same time once loaded will release the multiplied bacteria back into the water causing more harm than good.  You need a disinfectant in the water after the gravel and sand filter and you need to change the gravel and sand frequently in areas where the water is known to be contaminated.  I’m sorry, but the above mentioned water filter methods are very old and certainly don’t handle the job very well.  What I found very interesting is that they dismissed membrane filtration as ineffective because it does clog to fast, it would seem that they know little about that fact that even in older systems we use pre treatment like gravel and sand filters, carbon filters, and softeners to prepare the water before it goes to membrane filtration to be processed.  This article seems to be more filler than a news report.

Experts discussed the significance and incomprehensibility of the horrors of the Holocaust  in modern day studies Thursday in Doheny Memorial Library.
History · Panelist Stephen Smith discusses the value of learning from the stories of Holocaust survivors Thursday in the Doheny Memorial Library. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The panel discussion, hosted by the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study and the USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute was moderated by the Norman Lear Professor of Entertainment, Media and Society in Annenberg Martin Kaplan.
The time of the panel was particularly appropriate as Sunday night begins the 24-hour period of Yom HaShoah, the day each year among Jewish people remember the Holocaust.
The panel elaborated on the prevailing relevancy of the Holocaust 68 years later.
“The idea now behind genocide studies isn’t just descriptive, but prescriptive,” Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said. “The enormity of what happened during the Holocaust — the chilling efficiency, the numbers involved — allows it to be an important template and window to understand genocide broadly conceived.”
The panelists agreed that the survivor testimonies are vital to the way we understand the Shoah and all its aspects. To date, the Shoah Foundation has collected nearly 52,000 survivor testimonies.
Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education Executive Director Stephen D. Smith emphasized the value of each individual’s story.
“What you notice when you look at them one at a time is that they’re all different,” Smith said. “So, we’re all quite eager to find, ‘What’s the trope here? What’s the single narrative that we’re going to feel comfortable living with the next few hundred years?’ And the answer is, if we do find one, it’s going to be the wrong one, because the answer is found in the granularity of the individualities.”
One of the most captivating moments of the panel discussion revolved around the Shoah as not just a collection of historical narratives but one that is living.
“The Holocaust is also about us. It’s not just that we can essentialize as something evil that isn’t human, that isn’t relevant, that isn’t about us,” Soni said. “Storytelling gives us a powerful window to understand the Holocaust from the perspective of the victims, but I also think that we have the opportunity to tell new stories about ourselves and about the world.”
Soni compared the importance of learning history to the efforts being made by students on campus to understand modern-day issues.
“What I see on our college campus is students who are telling stories of reconciliation and engagement,” Soni said. “I’ve seen students who advocate for Israel and for Palestine come together and think constructively about how they can work together on certain issues.”
Soni said the lessons learned from telling the stories of individuals in the Holocaust could influence the way people choose to tell the stories about humanity today.
“I think this is an incredible opportunity for students, for the university in a global diasporic context, to really tell new stories about ourselves — to tell new stories about the world,” Soni said. “It’s not just stories from a historical perspective, but the way we tell stories about ourselves today.”
Luke Phillips, a freshman majoring in international relations and history, said the event highlighted the importance of viewing the Holocaust from a different moral and narrative perspective.
“The main reason I came here was to get a different moral version than what I’ve heard from mass media,” Phillips said. “It brings to my mind the question of [whether this] is the greatest evil ever perpetrated, objectively, or is this really a thing of the times — that every age has its own atrocities?”
I would like to see tales from the Nakba added to the Visual History project as well, particularly lest they be lost for all time.

Low and hard.
That’s this year’s offensive philosophy for the USC baseball team, which has experienced varying degrees of success and execution over the first 28 games of the Trojans’          (11-17) season.
“We don’t have a lot of power, especially at our field,” senior outfielder Greg Zebrack said. “You hit a fly ball here it’s an out, so we stress hitting the ball low and hard. If you do that, the fielder has to gather the ball, then he’s gotta throw the ball to first and the first baseman has to catch the ball too. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong, as opposed to hitting a fly ball [when] the guy just has to catch it. You learn that in Little League.”
The Trojans have proven the ability to do that just fine this year, such as when they smacked 37 hits in a three-game series against Cal last weekend. They’ve also shown a knack for failing spectacularly at that concept, hitting 11 fly ball outs and striking out seven times in an offensively dismal 3-1 loss to UC Irvine on Tuesday.
USC has hit right with its opponents this year but hasn’t put runs across the plate at even close to the same rate. Part of that comes from a lack of execution of the “little things,” as USC head coach Dan Hubbs refers to small-ball plays such as bunting a runner over and making productive outs.
“We have to make the defense make plays,” Hubbs said. “We can’t just keep giving them outs at the plate.”
That becomes all the more imperative this weekend as the Trojans take on the Stanford Cardinal. The Farm has been a hotbed of professional prospects in recent years, but perhaps none as tantalizing as ace Mark Appel, who will start for the Cardinal (14-9) tonight. Appel was projected as the first overall draft pick as a junior last year but wasn’t picked until eighth overall and chose to return to school for his senior season.
And it’s been a spectacular season so far for Appel. The ace is 4-2 with a 0.96 ERA in six starts, including three complete games. He has 64 strikeouts and just eight walks in 47 innings of work, causing Hubbs to liken his performance to Mark Prior’s epic 2001 season at USC when he went 15-1 with a 1.69 ERA and 202 strikeouts to 18 walks in 138 2/3 innings.
“The way you get to those guys is to force action,” Hubbs said on how his sometimes meek-hitting team can beat Appel. “Put the ball in play, make them have to make plays and not just give them free outs. So you may see us force some action and play a little more aggressively, and see if we can get them to make some mistakes.”
As great as Appel has been this year, the Trojans are in good hands on the mound in their own right on Friday with Bob Wheatley. The junior starter has a 1.58 ERA in 45 2/3 innings this year, and Hubbs is confident his ace can match Stanford’s.
“We know it’s gonna be a close game,” Hubbs said. “With the way Wheatley’s been pitching and with Appel, obviously, runs are really gonna be at a premium.”
First pitch Friday at Dedeaux Field is at 6 p.m., with Saturday’s matinee at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s series finale at 1 p.m.

The USC women’s lacrosse team got off to a strong start in the month of April, looking to end a three-game losing streak and turn things around after a 3-6 March. They fought hard against a defensive-minded Oregon squad, ending their slide and keeping the Ducks winless in conference play with a 12-10 win on Thursday in Eugene, Or. The win also came at the first lacrosse game live-broadcasted on the Pac-12 Network.
The Women of Troy (6-8, 3-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) were led by freshman attackers Caroline de Lyra, who finished with three goals and three assists, and Caroline Cordrey, who scored four goals on seven shots. Freshman midfielder Haleigh Dalmass and freshman attack Paige Bonomi added two goals apiece, with Bonomi assisting on another goal.
Oregon’s (5-6, 0-2 MPSF) Hayley Millner led all scorers with five goals on six shots. Shannon Propst assisted on three goals.
“This was a great win for us,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “Obviously, a conference win is always important. This really was the first game in which we played a full 60 minutes where every single player played a major role in securing the victory.”
After both teams scored their first goals within 45 seconds of each other, each team alternated scoring runs. USC scored the next two goals, followed by three unanswered from Oregon to take a 4-3 lead. The Women of Troy fought back to take a 6-4 lead thanks to de Lyra’s two goals and one from freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen, before Oregon came back to tie it back up. Cordrey’s second goal, a free-position goal with 40 seconds left in the half, put the Women of Troy back ahead 7-6 entering halftime. USC was ultimately outshot 12-9 by the Ducks.
The back-and-forth nature of the game would continue in the second half, with the Ducks’ Millner scoring a pair of early goals to give Oregon an 8-7 lead. USC followed up with another three unanswered goals, two of them from Cordrey, to take a 10-8 lead, before Oregon came back and tied it at 10 with 11:26 remaining. Dalmass’ second goal broke the tie, while de Lyra’s third with 1:51 remaining sealed the win for the Women of Troy.
“Caroline [de Lyra] was challenging in, and I saw my defender turn away, and I just went to goal and Caroline made a great pass to me,” Dalmass said. “She is a great, great feeder and she just made a great pass on that play.”
USC outshot Oregon 11-7 for the second half and 20-19 for the game. USC committed six turnovers compared to Oregon’s five, although USC won in both ground balls (7-4) and draw controls (12-11).
The Women of Troy will play the remainder of their regular season in California against conference opponents, starting with a pair of home games against California (6-4, 3-0 MPSF) on Friday, April 12, at 3 p.m. and Fresno State (2-8, 0-3 MPSF) on Saturday, April 20, at 3 p.m. USC will then conclude the season on the road against San Diego State (7-4, 2-1 MPSF) on Saturday, April 27, at 7 p.m.

The Trojans are striving to continue their early season momentum on both the East and West Coasts this weekend. The No. 8 men’s and No. 25 women’s track and field teams are gearing up to compete in two events: the 69th annual Florida Relays and the Cal State L.A. Invitational.
“Primarily, we have built toward a crescendo in what we do in terms of preparing for major competition in the NCAA levels,” USC Director of Track and Field Ron Allice said of the Florida Relays. “This is our first exposure to not only some of the best collegians in the country, but also post-collegians who we will be competing with.”
The talent will be fierce at the storied Florida Relays, which will be held Thursday through Saturday at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The relays are one of the nation’s premier track and field meets, drawing athletes from high school, collegiate and international ranks.
The Trojans face highly ranked teams on both the men’s and women’s sides. On the men’s side, the Trojans will contend with the No. 3 Gators and the No. 6 Florida State Seminoles. Beyond the top-10 ranked teams, the Trojans will be joined by four other NCAA Division I programs: No. 11 Ole Miss, No. 17 Indiana, No. 23 Baylor and No. 25 Oklahoma State.
The Women of Troy will also face sizeable competition, including No. 6 Texas. Other notable women’s teams competing in the relays are No. 12 University of Central Florida, No. 14 Baylor and No. 19 Georgia.
Allice said the relays will provide a good challnege and measure of the season thus far in addition to helping prepare the team for critical meets that start at the end of this month.
“It is difficult to say whether we are ready yet,” Allice said. “It will give us a benchmark to let us know what we need to do in order to prepare ourselves for what occurs after this. There is a big push to be at our best at the end of this month into May and June.”
Freshman Tera Novy, who throws hammer for the women’s team, expressed excitement and high expectations for the Relays.
“My goal is to compete well and perform the best that I can,” Novy said. “I am very excited for the competition that will be competing at this meet.”
On the West Coast, the Trojans will compete at the Cal State L.A. Invitational, which will be held Friday through Saturday at the Jesse Owens Track in Los Angeles. The events will kickoff with the hammer at 9 a.m. today.
The Trojans and Women of Troy enter both meets coming off of three competitions last week, including a five-out-of-eight-event win at the Cal-Nevada Championships in La Jolla, Calif.
Novy, who finished third in the hammer with a strong throw of 163-7 (49.87 m), reported a positive experience                                                                              at the Cal-Nevada Championships and noted that the meet provided her with a good opportunity to get another competition under her belt.
“My experience at the Cal-Nevada Championships was fun and full of learning,” Novy said. “I believe my team competed very well.”
In addition to the success at the Cal-Nevada Championships, the Trojans posted high marks at the Cal Multi-Events Championship last Friday. Notably, junior Viktor Fajoyomi scored 7,078 points to win his first career decathlon competition. Fajoyomi’s score places him a mere 20 points outside the Trojans’ all-time top-10 in the event.
“My primary goal was to get an NCAA qualifying mark at the meet,” Fajoyomi said. “But mainly I entered this meet to get a point, which helps me figure out what I need to improve on before my next decathlon competition at the Pac-12s. I was happy that I could win my first decathlon competition; however, the score was not what I was expecting.”
Fajoyomi hopes to qualify for the NCAA championships in the decathlon as well as assist his team in the high jump and long jump.
Following the Florida Relays and Cal State L.A. Invitational, the team will head to the Mount San Antonio College Relays on April 18-19 in Walnut, Calif.

George Farmer’s 2013-14 season is over before it even began.
The junior wide receiver suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and a torn medial collateral ligament in practice Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Farmer, who was the top receiver prospect in the class of 2011, prepped with current Trojan star Marqise Lee and former star Robert Woods at Serra High School and was considered by many to be the best of the bunch. But the magic he found in high school hasn’t translated thus far at USC. Unfortunately, that won’t be changing in 2013.
Add Farmer to the long list of injured Trojans this spring: Senior running back Silas Redd, junior tight end Xavier Grimble and junior linebacker/running back Tre Madden are all sidelined.
It’s an all-star team of injured players, and right now, the Trojans are hurting. Big time. Without Redd, the total number of carries by Trojan runners from last year’s roster is at an underwhelming 72. Thirteen of those were from Lee, by the way. And without Grimble, returning tight ends caught just 14 passes.
Things look rather bleak right now, but in the grand scheme of things, these injuries are going to help the Trojans. Now, I’m not implying that Farmer tearing his knee to shreds is good for the team; for all we know, Farmer could have been this season’s breakout star. But with proven players out this spring and for the foreseeable future, younger players now have the opportunity to step up and show that they deserve playing time when the season kicks off at Hawai’i. Look no further than freshman running back Justin Davis.
Davis, who hails from Stockton, Calif., enrolled early at USC in an effort to get ahead of his freshmen counterparts. Not only is he above the competition in his class, but he is catching up with Redd and redshirt junior running back D.J. Morgan, with whom Davis is splitting the majority of the practice carries this spring. He’s looking great thus far and, with a solid spring game, could go for even more carries come fall camp.
With Grimble out, it is a chance for fellow junior tight end Randall Telfer to step up and take the reins. Grimble caught 12 passes last season, but with players like Lee and Woods around him, he was almost forgotten in the mix. Another tight end, sophomore                                 Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick, also has a chance to step up his game after catching just two passes as a freshman; he’s now going to be depended on in double-tight sets for the last few practices of the spring. Is there any better time to show his skills? Probably not.
As for the receiving corps, losing Farmer for the season definitely stings, especially in the wake of Woods leaving for the NFL. But in the “glass-half-full” department, it is a chance for sophomore Nelson Agholor to prove without a doubt that he is ready to be the No. 2 behind Lee. Though he was slated to be the starter anyway, with Farmer out and unproven depth behind him, Agholor will likely see a lot more passes thrown in his direction.
And who will step up and be the No. 3 in Farmer’s place? It could be a lot of guys. Victor Blackwell. De’Von Flournoy. It could even be freshman Darreus Rogers, whose debut has long been anticipated since he was ruled academically ineligible last season. In the spring of last season, Flournoy was one of the stars in the spring. Though it didn’t parlay into a great deal of success (he caught one pass in 2012), who’s to say that someone like Rogers can’t have a big spring and turn it into a strong freshman campaign like Lee and Woods did before him?
Nothing in football is guaranteed. Well, there is one thing: injuries. They are bound to happen to every team, regardless of how well trained and prepared its players are. Just because injuries happen doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world, though. Rather, it’s a chance for unproven players to turn themselves into role players and sometimes even stars.
Back in 2009, a freshman named Matt Barkley was slated to be the No. 2 behind veteran Aaron Corp. Corp got hurt in fall practice, and Barkley got his chance. A conference-record 116 touchdown passes later, I’d say things turned out pretty well for the Trojans. Who’s to say that this season’s injuries can’t create more stars?

After an eventful weekend trip to the Bay Area, USC’s No. 3 men’s tennis team returns to Marks Stadium today to kick off a four-game home stretch against a number of Pac-12 opponents.
Return to action · Freshman Max de Vroome (above) is hoping to play this weekend after missing the past month with a wrist injury. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (18-2, 1-0 Pac-12) are coming off of a 6-1 thrashing of Stanford, which extended USC’s winning streak to six in a row and secured head coach Peter Smith’s 500th career win.
The Trojans were impressive in singles play, taking all six matches against the Cardinal, but dropped the doubles point for the first time since their home loss to UCLA on Feb. 22.
“Our doubles wasn’t where it should be against Stanford,” Smith said. “We didn’t play as a team out there. … I don’t like to see us outcompeted and I feel like we were outcompeted at Stanford.”
The Trojans were going to have the chance to redeem their doubles play in an Easter match against the California Golden Bears, but the match was canceled because of rain and will not be rescheduled. The Trojans are now setting their sights on their upcoming Pac-12 opponents, the No. 71 Arizona Wildcats and the No. 75 Utah Utes.
Though the Wildcats (10-8, 0-2), opened up their season with five consecutive wins, they have struggled to find their rhythm since then, most recently falling to the then-No. 42 Oregon Ducks. Arizona’s roster features no ranked players in singles or doubles.
Similarly, the Utes (11-7, 1-1) won six games in a row to begin their season before falling off. Unlike Arizona, though, they’ve been able to keep up some level of success. Utah is coming off of a 4-3 loss to the Washington Huskies but has some momentum coming into the match, as they are nationally ranked for the first time this season.
Certain Trojans will be bringing their own personal momentum to this weekend’s matches as well. Sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 48 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, is undefeated in dual-match singles play this season, racking up 13 straight victories since his last defeat at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup on Jan. 19. USC’s three junior co-captains are all streaking as well, with No. 9 Ray Sarmiento winning seven straight and No. 6 Emilio Gomez and No. 87 Michael Grant winning six straight each.
In addition to these steady contributors, USC anticipates the return of No. 102 freshman Max de Vroome, who sat out with a wrist injury for a month. This season has been fraught with growing pains for the freshman from the Netherlands, but he is taking his injury in stride and treating it as a learning experience.
“In a lot of ways, it’s actually good because I can focus on a lot of different things which I would never focus on if I didn’t break my wrist,” de Vroome said.
With the return of de Vroome, the team is eager to take on Arizona and Utah. The Trojans face a unique challenge against these teams, though, as the No. 71 Wildcats and the No. 75 Utes are the two lowest-ranked squads USC has faced this season since their doubleheader against unranked Loyola Marymount and San Francisco at the beginning of February. The team vows to not underestimate their opponents, though, like Sarmiento said they did in doubles at Stanford.
“We didn’t prepare enough to win that doubles point,” Sarmiento said. “We’re definitely not going to make that same mistake. We’re going to go out there prepared and with good energy and that will take care of the rest.”
Friday’s match against Arizona is set to begin at 1:30 p.m. Saturday’s match versus Utah will kick off at 1 p.m. Both matches will be played at Marks Tennis Stadium.

If football season began Thursday, the Trojans would be in dire straits. At the start of practice, 20 players were sidelined with injuries. By the end, that list had grown to 22 after redshirt sophomore guard Cyrus Hobbi and senior cornerback Torin Harris went down with injuries as well.
Beat up secondary · Senior cornerback Torin Harris (above) was injured during practice on Thursday attempting to defend a pass. The Trojans are already without injured freshman safety Su’a Cravens. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
This comes after the USC Trojans Twitter account announced Thursday that junior wide receiver George Farmer will miss the entire 2013 season while recovering from a torn ACL and MCL, and head coach Lane Kiffin announced that freshman safety Su’a Cravens suffered a torn meniscus and will be out until summer.
The injuries come at an inopportune time for the Trojans, especially considering a secondary that was already in urgent need of further development with the departure of senior safety T.J. McDonald and junior cornerback Nickell Robey to the NFL draft. This need has been further compounded by new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 defensive scheme, which employs a high number of man-coverage packages and leans heavily on effective technique, speed and talent at the cornerback position.
With the injuries to key players, the onus is on players such as redshirt sophomore cornerback Ryan Henderson to mature and grow into the system to make an impact right away.
“It’s definitely a challenge, but with the great coach we have in Coach Clancy, with the adjustment he made it simple,” Henderson said. “He taught us a lot of things that we haven’t been taught before when it comes to reading quarterbacks and reading receivers’ releases, which makes things easier.”
Though Henderson did what he could in his reps, the player he was assigned to cover was on a mission. Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor looked like a man possessed in practice reps Thursday, as he took two completions to the endzone for a touchdown.
His first was a thrilling run following a short completion from redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek. After hauling in the short completion, Agholor eluded three defenders by exploiting a gaping seam in the secondary and ran toward the left sideline for the touchdown. The second was higher in terms of degree of difficulty — Wittek fired a laser between the outstretched arms of redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown, and Agholor came down with a dazzling one-handed grab in the endzone. The catch caused hysteria on the sidelines and ended a tough practice on a high note. After practice, head coach Lane Kiffin lauded Agholor’s natural gifts.
“I really believe Nelson could have done similar things to what [junior wide receiver] Marqise [Lee] did his freshman year and [former Trojans wide receiver] Robert [Woods] did his freshman year,” Kiffin said. “If he had been our number two receiver [last season], I think he would have had the same type of numbers.”
Conventional wisdom says that Agholor’s success may have come at least partially as a result of the thinning out of the secondary, and there is an amount of truth to the observation. Kiffin stressed the urgent need for his players to recover to full health.
“With our reductions already, we would not be able to keep up this pace during the season,” Kiffin said. “We’ll start fall camp this way, but I don’t think we’ll be able to end fall camp this way.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans’ full contact practices look as if they will continue throughout spring. One can only hope that the team sustains no further injuries, as spring ball wraps up with an exhibition scrimmage next Saturday, April 13 at the Coliseum.

Protesting for students’ rights
The trend in the last three years has been unconformity. Around Europe, thousands of students took to the streets to protest governments’ implementations of new austerity measures. In the Middle East, we witnessed the youth rise against authoritarian governments, using social networks and new technologies to consolidate an Arab Spring that extended from Tunisia to Syria. In the United States, the 99 percent expressed their frustration at the 1 percent through a leaderless movement that began as an occupation of New York’s Wall Street and eventually made its way to other cities.
Protesting is a practice that seems ancient but has gained momentum once again. It’s time for more college students to embrace it.
Those who talked about a disengaged, passionless youth, about a lost generation absorbed by video games and the Internet, were proven wrong, with these recent examples. Nevertheless, there is a place that remains largely unmoved by this shift in world dynamics: the University of Southern California. There is a lot to be grateful for but there is still plenty to be pissed about.
According to U.S. News and World Report, USC has managed to position itself as the No. 24 nationally university in the nation and the administration is aiming to place USC in the top 10 list, up there with Harvard and Yale. President C. L. Max Nikias has even promised to turn the campus into a true college town through the Master Plan. Let’s applaud — USC is conducting a great public relations campaign.
However, since this new construction will not be ready until 2030, we will not be around to reap the benefits. In the meantime, current students must pay an exorbitant cost of attendance that can add up to $60,000 per year. We must deal with a shortage of housing that ultimately forces students to live in overpriced bedrooms in South Los Angeles while experiencing shootings outside and inside the campus — landlords must be laughing all the way to the bank.
We must settle for libraries that don’t have the capacity to hold the sudden flux of students during midterms and finals, and a bureaucracy that constantly misplaces and slowly reviews student transcripts, petitions, etc. I have shared these complaints with my fellow students but we only seem to b-tch about it or comply.
Campus politics will remain the same until we stop being a silent majority. Some might ask: why is protesting beneficial?
Protesting works because it brings attention to the cracks in the system. For the average American college student, protesting achieved desegregation in schools, furthered free speech and academic freedom in campuses across the country and pushed greater education funding — all things we take for granted today.
So if you have a problem, protest through a letter, a sit-in, by collecting signatures or by writing an article for the student paper. The mediums are endless and there is only one outcome: progress. Protesting is much more than whining or complaining — it materializes the hope that things can always be better than they are.
I urge you, potential student protester, to celebrate what is right and criticize what is wrong. Make your voice be heard, or at least make them pay attention to your parent’s paycheck. USC should be giving you back its money’s worth. Tell them to stop paying Lane Kiffin $4 million a year and maybe use some of that money to improve the things the average student needs. Make them give you everything they promised in their glossy designer brochures and cheerful campus tours.
After all, it is you who keeps the University of Southern California up and running.

A smoking revolver, one dead woman and a confession from the very man who committed the act — the evidence for murder is all there in the details of Arizona man George Sanders’ “mercy killing” of his 81-year-old wife, Virginia.
Lost in the distant objectivity of the headlines, however, is a heartbreaking story of love, disease and a husband’s courageous decision to put an end to his wife’s battle with multiple sclerosis.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Last November, 86-year-old Sanders took a shotgun and fatally shot his wife, who he said had begged to be killed. This past week, Sanders was given probation after pleading guilty to manslaughter.
To some, Sanders got away with murder. But though voluntary euthanasia is a subject mired in ethical controversy, Sanders’ actions reveals how inadequacies in the medical system and the sheer suffering involved in terminal diseases can push ordinary people to behave extraordinarily.
The story of the Sanders is, for one, an absolute tearjerker.
According to the Huffington Post, George Sanders loved his wife from the moment he met her, when she was 15, to her last days at 81. In 1969, Virginia was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. George Sanders became her sole caregiver.
“He cooked for her, cleaned the house, did laundry, put on her makeup and would take her to the beauty salon where he’d hold her hands up so she could get her nails done,” the HuffPo reported.
Right before her death, Virginia Sanders was set to be admitted to a nursing home. George Sanders said during his interrogation that “It was just the last straw. … She didn’t want to go to the hospital.” And so, after some hesitation, he killed her.
A crime is a crime, but considering the difficult circumstances, the two-year probation sentence is exactly what the judge of the case dubbed it: a punishment that “tempers justice with mercy.” George Sanders’ story is one that many should be able to empathize with, especially considering the pressure he must have felt to relieve a loved one who begs to be freed from an unbearable misery.
But the ongoing debates on the right to die and voluntary euthanasia don’t end with the Sanders’ story. Though voluntary euthanasia is partly or wholly illegal in most U.S. states, there are decent arguments for both sides of the controversy.
On one side, opponents of  voluntary euthanasia argue that the act not only weakens society’s respect for the sanctity of life, but also undermines the motivation to provide quality care for the dying as well as the life’s work of doctors and nurses dedicated to saving lives.
Others claim voluntary euthanasia’s implementation would, more than anything, discourage the search for new cures and treatments for the terminally ill. Society’s acceptance of euthanasia could also increase the pressures that selfish families place on elderly relatives.
On the other hand, proponents of euthanasia argue that people do have the right to die and to decide what happens to their bodies — because, after all, it is not ethical to restrict individuals’ liberties, even if that includes killing oneself.
Yet, euthanasia is clearly not the right path for anyone, not only because of societal repercussions, but because of the burden of guilt that the family members like George Sanders might shoulder after the fact.
Regardless of whether his wife begged him to shoot or not, the stigma of knowing that he caused her death will be something that George Sanders will live with. Yes, he did shoot his wife out of love, but it’s also unfortunate that better alternatives weren’t out there.
Perhaps one day, with the expansion of cutting-edge palliative care as well as cures or treatments for diseases as devastating as multiple sclerosis, voluntary euthanasia will become an option of the past. Or perhaps a growth in the acceptance of physician aid-in-dying will allow people like Virginia Sanders to die in a more dignified fashion.
One should not have to feel the need to resort to such a violent form of euthanasia in order to set someone free. But it seems that, for the time being, people such as the Sanders are left with few alternative choices.

Agreed, it is a very well-thought-out article.
But I can’t agree with John that medically assisted dying should be legalized. In both Oregon and the Netherlands, the numbers of people requesting death on the grounds that they don’t want to become a burden on others has risen year on year, strongly suggesting an abuse of the law. Further, – in both places, palliative care in a hospice setting has declined dramatically, – what need for a hospice when you can just offer a quick death instead? This can’t be the way we want society to go.
Great article, Valerie.  There is some suffering that only death can end.
 I think that we should be allowed to make the decision on on when to end our own life at a time and in a situation that we decide. Medically assisted dying is not for everyone but everyone should have the right to choose.
The sooner that the laws relating to assisted suicide are changed to allow for medically assisted dying under controls similar to those that are in place now in Oregon, Washington, the Netherlands, Belgiuma nd Swizerland the better.

The box office rose to nice enough levels over the Easter weekend, with G.I. Joe: Retaliation commandeering a $51 million-plus total for its four-day opening weekend. Though that’s slightly less than the take of its predecessor, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, that film opened in the middle of the summer.
The real story is that its international numbers constituted a 70 percent increase over the first movie’s, which partly justifies its nine-month delay and 3D conversion.
Other films did just as well, with The Croods dropping only 38.8 percent from its opening weekend, which seems to show that the family dynamic of the film is really connecting with audiences, while Tyler Perry’s Temptation did $21.6 million. Not bad for an erotic thriller that’s been accused of being, well, the same as any other Tyler Perry movie.
Though April has historically been a dead month for films (there are only seven wide releases through the month), this year, studios have brought some high-level releases to the forefront. This weekend, we see two films that’ll bring us back in time: the 3D re-release of Jurassic Park and the Evil Dead remake.
Jurassic Park 3D is the latest in a run of 3D re-releases over the past two years. This move came because the The Lion King re-release in 2011 broke out with a phenomenal $94.2 million. Since then, though, most of the re-releases have only drawn in revenues in the range of $40 million to $60 million, which is where people expect Jurassic Park 3D to end up.
There are, however different factors to consider.
For one, while Star Wars: Episode I and Titanic were extremely popular at their times of release, with the latter film still ranking as the second highest-grossing film of all time, they’re not exactly the most beloved films of the franchise. You’d have to classify those films as phenomenons; features that were just able to connect at the right time.
Jurassic Park, though, is not only one of the most popular films of all time but one of the most beloved; it was one of those generational experiences that defined the youth of the current generation. The fact that the revolutionary CGI still holds up 20 years after its release is a testament to just how ahead of its time it was — that was one reason why The Lion King did so well.
However, the The Lion King 3D also had the advantage of the original film not being released on Blu-ray yet. In contrast, other re-releases so far have not only been on home video but also are shown regularly on TV channels (Spike TV seemed at one point to be showing the Star Wars prequel trilogy every other week).
Jurassic Park 3D does have that working against it since it’s been on Blu-ray/DVD for a while now and is shown on television from time to time.  The nature of the film and the chance to see the T. Rex on the giant screen again, however, seems to be overcoming the fact that anyone could watch it at home right now if he or she wanted to. Expect an opening in the higher $20 millions, if not right at $30 million.
This weekend’s single current release is Evil Dead, the remake/side story to the Evil Dead trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell as the boomstick-wielding, chainsaw-handed Ash. This film, directed by Fede Alvarez, replaces Ash with Mia, played by Jane Levy, and returns to the plot of the first film with a group of friends traveling to a cabin in the woods and coming across a book that ends up summoning a demonic force.
As far as horror remakes go, the hype for Evil Dead has been extremely high, with a glowing response from its screening at South By Southwest. Raimi, who produced this remake, also used his publicity tour for his feature Oz: The Great and Powerful to talk about Evil Dead even more than his own film. The fact it declares right there on the poster that it’s “the most terrifying film you will ever experience,” is a lot to live up to.
The issue, though, is that if it’s going for name recognition, there are a few problems with that. The remake seems to be more in line with the straight horror of the original even though the franchise was more popularized by the campy absurdity of Evil Dead 2 and especially Army of Darkness. And without a character as distinctive and odd as Ash, it makes this film seem like any other hyper-violent horror remake with no real discernible hook.
It is easily the most hyped horror film in a while, though, and it fills a niche; while it could break out to a mid-$20 million opening or higher, it’ll likely settle slightly below that. Raimi and Campbell do hope that the success of this film can lead to an Army of Darkness 2 film.
So you have a choice: a hyped-up, extremely bloody horror film or the dinosaur film. If you grew up in the ’90s, the answer should be obvious (it’s OK, velociraptors will always be cool).

When Hattie Davis, an aspiring actress from Witchita, Kansas, moved to Los Angeles, the last thing on her mind was making pickles.
Haute pickle · Hattie Davis came to Los Angeles aspiring to act, but she soon decided to change paths and pursue a career creating unique pickles. — Courtesy of Hattie Davis
“I came to L.A. to be an actor and of course I got frustrated, just like everyone does,” Davis said. “I’d been waiting tables pretty much my entire life. And I was like, ‘I got to do something.’ I didn’t want to wait tables for the rest of my life.”
Then her fiance’s aunt sent her a jar of homemade pickles. Davis, who has always loved pickles, thought they were better than anything she had ever purchased from the store.
“And I thought, ‘I’m going to make some pickles,’” Davis said.
Davis first used a recipe she had found in GQ. Then, inspired by an old deli in her hometown, Davis made a variety of spicy pickles.
“I invited all of my friends to come over and try them,” Davis said. “They were like, ‘These are really good. You should start a business.’”
And so she did. Three years later, Davis is making pickles by the jar for her company, Hattie’s Hotties. At the last Unique LA — a seasonal boutique featuring local products — Davis sold 400 jars in just two days. Apart from larger shows, Davis currently sells her spicy pickles through her website and at a variety of markets, including the Foothill Artisan Market.
“Now, I’m just looking to get into as many farmers markets as I can and solidifying my space in a commercial kitchen so that I can do that,” Davis said.
Hattie’s Hotties currently sells pickles in four different variations: Hattie’s Hotties, Vampire Slayers, BB’s and Bloody Buddies.
Hattie’s Hotties are spicy dill pickles, Vampire Slayers are garlic dill pickles and the BB’s are spicy bread-and-butter pickles. Arguably the most intricate offering, however, is the Bloody Buddies, a mix of spicy pickles, asparagus, green beans, carrots and okra (this was partially inspired by the Beach Ball, a bar in Seal Beach that serves pickled asparagus with its Bloody Marys).
Rock and Reilly’s Irish Pub, a restaurant and bar on the Sunset strip, uses Hattie’s Hotties and BB’s for some of its sandwiches.
Davis said she came upon these recipes through a process of trial and error, but also sought the guidance of some old family recipes.
“I did a lot of online research, read a lot of books and just played around with stuff,” Davis said.
Davis used to be stationed in Culver City, where she shared a kitchen. But because of a change in laws stating that only one business can operate in one kitchen at a time, Davis moved her cooking to Pasadena, which has different regulations.
Davis makes her pickles about once a week and estimates that she can produce about 50 jars in eight hours. Each jar is 32 oz.
“It’s hard work,” Davis said. “It’s a hard, long day and it’s hot, and you’re over boiling vinegar and water all day.”
But cooking is not the most challenging part of operating a small business, Davis said.
“It’s the rest of the filling through the red tape and figuring out what rules you need to follow,” Davis said.
In fact, Davis loves cooking pickles.
“I just enjoy it,” Davis said. “I like the time alone in the kitchen. It’s kind of a Zen thing. It’s a lot of repetitive stuff but it’s good. I love the feeling of accomplishment when I’m done, seeing those 50 jars sitting there, waiting to make me money.”
Davis does not operate her entire business alone. She has received a lot of help and support from her fiance.
“He’s the muscle. We have to go up two sets of stairs to get to the kitchen so it’s lots of heavy lifting,” said Davis, who said she buys anywhere from 50 to 75 pounds of cucumbers at a time.
Her fiance, a comic book artist, also helped her design the labels for the jars.
Looking to the future, Hattie said she would love to make her own Bloody Mary mix and also transition to using sealable plastic bags.
“The sky’s the limit,” she said. “Honestly, I would love to do all kinds of stuff.”
Davis said she’s received positive feedback from many customers and has even been able to persuade pickle haters to buy a jar of Hattie’s Hotties after sampling her creations.
“People love the labels. People love the names. And they just love them,” Davis said. “They’re just better than anything you can buy in the store. You can really tell the difference.”

When the great Maddy Keavy and I decided to perform at Ground Zero, it was as much of a joke as Vermin Supreme running for President.
The shtick was simple: We’d ask the audience to call out a word, I would drop a beat, and Maddy would begin to rap lyrics adhering to the theme determined by our peers.
As part of a way to deal with the anxiety of being a Springie, freshmen Rini Sampath and Maddy Keavy performed as an improv hip-hop duo at Ground Zero. — Rini Sampath | Daily Trojan
But when it came to hip hop music, neither one of us had the slightest idea on what made a good show.  I learned how to beatbox after watching a YouTube video for four hours when I was in the 7th grade. Maddy freestyled when we’d have nights out with our girls. Our combined comedy experience amounted to making our parents laugh at the dinner table and cracking inappropriate jokes when we were with our friends.
So when we got on stage that Monday night in our coordinated sparkly blouses and backwards snapbacks claiming to be an “improv-comedy-rap-duo”, we didn’t expect applause, uproarious laughter, or an e-mail request for us to come back and perform at an actual USC event. But all of those things ended up happening.
Before we knew it, we were on flyers around campus. We had a Facebook “like” page, a Soundcloud, and people in the dining halls asking if we were the Maddy and Rini of “Maddy & Rini”.
While some of our performances have been huge hits, some of the things we’ve done have been complete flops. There was one time we delivered a few jokes on stage… and it was so quiet that someone’s hair could have fallen in the back of the room and we would have heard it hit the ground.
But our “improv-comedy-rap-duo” has saved us from the stress of freshmen year. Besides an abundance of extracurricular activities, our courseload, social life and transitioning into college as spring admits has been hectic, to say the least.
This “Maddy & Rini” gig, however, has provided us with the break we need from the routine of life. Maddy wants to be a top-notch journalist one day, and I’m still adamant about running for office after I finish up my undergraduate degree and law school. All of this tomfoolery, ultimately, has given us an opportunity to explore other sides of ourselves that aren’t so serious.
This isn’t to say that everyone who is struggling to adjust to campus life should get up on stage and do something crazy, but it certainly has helped us to take on any sort of risk. It’s made us even more bold  and more confident about who we are. So, as “Maddy & Rini”, even if a few of our jokes or songs fall flat, looking back, at least we’ll have each other.
I’ve watched this duo before, what you call “beat boxing” isn’t even close to the real thing. Your friend however, is extremely talented. Get off your high horse and don’t publish articles that only boost your ego and paint a false picture of what you have done here so far.
Dude, you must be really cool. So this person had the courage to go up on stage and perform in front of people despite knowing basically no one in the crowd. She put her name on what she did and she wrote an article about it and then you attack her anonymously, what kind of crappy Trojan are you?

People these days don’t like baseball. Maybe that’s not entirely true, but America’s favorite pastime—and its first—has certainly taken a backseat to the fast-paced, media juggernauts that are football and basketball.
Sure, baseball is slow. Those foreign to the game pick up on a seeming lack of action and an overabundance of “in-between” time. Baseball is intrinsically Hitchcockian, and we live in a world of instant gratification. Baseball isn’t as flashy or glamorous as the other two elite sports, but it’s cinematic and nostalgic.
But if you’re not the sentimental type, consider this: the 2013 baseball season is tailored for any sports fan that wants to witness greatness. And let’s be honest, that’s why we all watch, right? Without further ado, here are some reasons to watch baseball this season.
First, let’s be a little presumptuous and extrapolate what we’ve witnessed in the first two or three or so games to what we should expect from the remaining 160
Pitching Feats: The Texas Rangers’ Yu Darvish was perfect through 8.2 innings in his first start, surrendering a no-no opportunity when a grounder found the gap between his legs and into centerfield. Los Angeles Dodger and former Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw threw nine shutout innings against the reigning champion San Francisco Giants. And in case you want to start counting, both Kershaw and Washington Nationals lefty Gio Gonzalez have both hit home runs.
Offense: In the inaugural game of the season, the Houston Astros marked their American League debut with two triples from Justin Maxwell that helped lead them to an 8-2 victory. For the rising-favorite Nationals, rookie sensation Bryce Harper launched two homers in their season opener. This kid is 20 years old, possibly younger than you and I.
Other Worthy Headlines: On Wednesday, Arizona notched a walk-off victory in the bottom of the 16th inning in a game where lead changed seven times between the Diamondbacks and the Cardinals.
Money (With A Local Twist): If you’re a Lakers fan, you probably like money or relish the teams that have it. Money buys freedom and championships, right? It’s a sore subject for the Lakers right now, but in baseball, the Dodgers just upped the ante. Magic Johnson and the whole organization emptied out the piggy bank to bring in some big names for a “Whole New Blue.” Success isn’t guaranteed, but it’s going to put the “Moneyball” theory to the test. And if you’re not from L.A. and you happen to enjoy bashing the Yankees for their similar reputation, a new villain has been born.
Not convinced yet? It’s still early. There are 160 games left in the season, and a lot more spectacle is bound to unfold.

After a mostly forgettable month of March, the USC women’s lacrosse team hopes to get back on the right track to start the month of April as they head up north to take on Oregon on Thursday, April 4 at 4:30 p.m. in the first live-broadcasted lacrosse game on the Pac-12 Network.
The Women of Troy (5-8, 2-2 MPSF) finished with a 3-6 record in March after a 16-11 loss to Denver (11-1, 3-0 MPSF). The Women of Troy looked rusty, perhaps as a result of having more than a week of rest in between games and fell behind 10-3 at the half. After giving up the first goal of the second half, USC finally appeared to wake up, scoring four unanswered goals to cut Denver’s lead to four.
But the team was unable to cut the deficit any further, as Denver held on to keep USC’s current skid alive. Freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen led the Women of Troy with five points (three goals, two assists) and eight draw controls, while freshman attacker Caroline Cordrey scored four goals.
“There’s always going to be runs in the game of lacrosse, and we just have to limit the other team’s runs,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “It’s really hard to have a shutout, so we can’t get down if they do get a goal. We have to respond to their goals and make good plays [on offense].”
Freshman attacker/midfielder Caroline de Lyra leads the team with 71 points (41 goals, 30 assists), while Johansen is second with 42 points (32 goals, 10 assists) and also leads the MPSF with 74 draw controls.
As they have been all season, de Lyra and Johansen will have to continue to lead USC’s attacking game for the team to be playing its best lacrosse at season’s end.
“We’re approaching the last four games of the season,” Munday said. “Right now we’re in a good spot in our conference, and we have the ability to do some great things this season. We need to learn from the games that we’ve had in the past and the losses that we’ve had, but in the end it’s a new season and we’re starting from scratch and really trying to get better every single day.”
Oregon (5-5, 0-1 MPSF) is coming off a three-game road trip after playing its first seven games at home, finishing 1-2 after barely beating Old Dominion (3-8, 1-0 Colonial) 10-9. The Ducks are led by Shannon Propst’s 33 points (14 goals, 19 assists) and Kate Cathell’s 28 points (19 goals, 9 assists). Oregon is averaging 9.5 goals per game and 9.7 goals allowed per game, compared to USC’s 12.4 goals per game and 12.2 goals allowed per game.
After the trip to Oregon, USC will play the remainder of the regular season in California. They will return to McAlister Field to play California (6-4, 3-0 MPSF) on Friday, April 12 at 3 p.m. and Fresno State (2-7, 0-2 MPSF) on Saturday, April 20 at 3 p.m. The Women of Troy will then head down to San Diego to conclude the regular season against San Diego State (7-3, 2-1 MPSF) on Saturday, April 27 at 7 p.m.
“We need to come off the first whistle on fire,” said freshman defender Courtney Tarleton, “We’ve started pretty slow, so as long as we’re coming out ready to play we’ll be fine.”
