The Pac-12 conference announced that USC senior Victoria Ishimatsu was chosen as the Women’s Diver of the Year and coach Hongping Li was selected as the Women’s Diving Coach of the Year Monday.
Both Ishimatsu and Li won their respective awards for the fourth consecutive year, becoming the first female swimmer/diver and coach duo to do so.
Ishimatsu won her first career NCAA title on 1-meter springboard during the 2012 NCAA championships, supplementing an All-American performance on the 3-meter springboard.
During the Pac-12 championships, she won the 3-meter springboard title for the fourth year in a row, becoming the first Pac-12 woman to do so and took home her third 1-meter springboard title.
She also finished a career-best second in the platform final, securing her third straight Pac-12 Diver of the Meet honor.
Li has amassed nine Pac-12 Women’s Diving Coach of the Year awards, the most in conference history. He has been the NCAA Women’s Diving Coach of the Year twice (2002 and 2006), and the 2009 Pac-10 Men’s Diving Coach of the Year. In his 13 years as USC’s head diving coach, his divers have won a total of six NCAA titles, 27 conference titles and have received 34 All-American honors.

USC athletics is on the rise. Though there has never been a significant drop off in the land of Troy, it is undeniable that there has been a recent surge. USC currently boasts several national championship-caliber programs.
Reign of Troy · USC’s men’s water polo team won its fourth consecutive national championship, setting the tone for the Trojans’ athletic dominance. - Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
In 2011, two programs hoisted the national championship trophy over their collective heads — men’s tennis and men’s water polo.
Because of the recent success in USC athletics among the men’s and women’s teams, the question must be asked: Is 2012 the year of Troy?
The men’s water polo team won its unprecedented fourth-consecutive national championship in December, setting the surge of athletic success in motion.
Without a doubt, the men’s and women’s water polo teams are officially in dynasty mode, greatly due to the leadership of coach Jovan Vavic.
Though the No. 3 Women of Troy have not won the national championship since 2010, 2012 might yield a different result.
With a record of 18-4 overall and 5-2 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play, the Women of Troy currently sit in third place in conference standings before the conclusion of the regular season next week.
The men’s volleyball team is leading the pack.
The No. 1 Trojans are wrapping up their regular season (only two matches remain in the regular season) after defeating No. 2 UC Irvine in its 15th consecutive win.
In the upcoming weeks, the Trojans will vie for the coveted MPSF title. Men’s volleyball boasts a 20-4 record overall in 2012 (16-4 MPSF record) and a handful of All-Americans.
The Trojans are in prime position to make a run for the MPSF title as they are led by Tony Ciarelli the senior outside hitter, who totaled 146 career aces in the match against UC Irvine.
Like volleyball, the men’s tennis program is on the verge of a title.
The reigning three-peat champions (2009, 2010 and 2011) are holding strong at No. 1. Following a defeat of Arizona over the weekend, the Trojans possess a 23-0 record and a 43-match win streak.
The men’s tennis team is looking to close out its “perfect” season against Bay Area rivals, California and Stanford to wrap up the regular season.
The Trojans will be competing for the historic fourth-consecutive national championship, only 1966-1969.
With the annual spring football game Saturday at the Los Angeles Coliseum, eyes have been fixed toward the USC football program.
Similar to other Trojan athletic programs, the football team is hoping to be in Miami, Fla., come January 2013 for the BCS National Championship.
Sure, it isn’t hard to imagine, considering the Trojans are fresh off of a 10-2 2011 season and have Heisman-hopeful Matt Barkley and safety T.J. McDonald returning for their senior seasons along with a cast of All-Americans returning for “unfinished business.”
Not only are Trojans competing for NCAA glory, many Trojans (current students and alumni) will be competing for Olympic gold this August in London, thus, expanding the Trojans’ domination.
Some have credited the recent success to USC athletic director Pat Haden and his excellent leadership since his arrival in 2010.
In the short time that Haden has been athletic director, USC has won three national championships and numerous conference titles.
Only time will tell until we see how many championships USC can rack up in the coming years.
The recent success of USC’s athletic programs alludes to the newfound athletic dynasty on the USC campus. Though it is only April, 2012 is already proving to be the most fruitful for all of the Trojan athletic teams.

A busy lineup of events is finally over for the USC men’s and women’s track and field teams.
Both squads traveled to three separate meets this Easter weekend, competing at a triple-meet at Brigham Young University and two meets at Stanford and Cal State Los Angeles.

The track and field team did not compete at full-strength at the meets, although more athletes competed at the BYU Triple Meet with hosts BYU and Boise State.
The Trojans entered the weekend ranked eighth in the nation, while the Women of Troy entered ranked fourth.
The track and field team did not send many athletes to Stanford or CSULA, opting instead to focus its competitive strength at the BYU-Boise State-USC Triple Meet.
As a result, only a handful of athletes competed at CSULA’s Tiny Lister Classic on Friday and Saturday, joined by a few more competing at the Stanford Relays.
Senior Joey Hughes captured the sole win for the USC Trojans at the Tiny Lister Classic, posting a time of 45.99 seconds to win the men’s 400-meter dash — a   season-record for the senior.
USC did not secure any wins at the Stanford Relays on Friday.
The teams found success at BYU’s Tri-Meet, and USC track and field came out of the meet with several wins at the single day event Saturday.
Junior Reggie Wyatt capped a win for the Trojans in the men’s 800-meter, posting a final time of 1:51.92.
Senior James Leckie also placed in the men’s 800-meter, finishing close behind Wyatt with a time of 1:53.13 to clinch second.
Freshman Allen Williams placed second in both men’s 110-meter hurdles as well as men’s triple jump, posting a time of 14.79 and a mark of 14.35m. Other Trojans that placed in Saturday’s tri-meet included junior Eric Stein, who placed third in men’s hammer throw, and senior Duane Walker placed third in men’s 400-meter hurdles.
Senior Aareon Payne won two separate events for the Women of Troy, finishing first in both women’s 100-meter dash and women’s 200-meter dash, posting times of 11.60 seconds and 23.69, respectively.
Sophomore Loudia Laarman also placed in the same events, finishing in close second in the women’s 100-meter with a time of 11.73, and finishing in third in the women’s 200-meter with a time of 24.55.
Other Women of Troy who placed first in track events included senior Dalilah Muhammad (women’s 400-meter hurdles), sophomore Lauren Blackburn (women’s 100-meter hurdles) and freshman Akawkaw Ndipagbor (women’s 400-meter). Senior Marissa Minderler finished first in both women’s shot put and women’s hammer throw.
Freshman Alexandra Collatz won the women’s discus throw, breaking a personal record in the process.
Despite recording several wins against two other nationally ranked teams at BYU’s tri-meet, USC finished the meet last in total points.
This score, however, is not representative of the team’s strength and is simply a measure of how many individuals from a team won (or placed) in events.
The USC track and field team competes next at the Mount San Antonio College Relays on April 19.

The Center for Excellence in Teaching hosted a seminar Monday to inform graduate students about teaching strategies and time management.
Making the Transition from Graduate Student to Professor, held at Doheny Memorial Library, focused on necessary preparations for graduate students interested in becoming professors.
Prepared · Michal Temkin Martinez, a USC alumna and recently hired professor at Boise State University, spoke about her transition to teaching on Monday. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Michal Temkin Martinez, a USC alumna and a newly appointed professor at Boise State University, said her path to success in teaching was knowing her expectations, documenting her progress and making sure she balanced activities in three areas: teaching, research and service.
“Colleges actually have very specific guidelines — make sure you know what is expected of you and be aware of the policies that are going to affect you for tenure and promotion,” Martinez said. “I actually have two friends who were denied tenure because they were promised things but didn’t get it in writing.”
Martinez said some of the challenges of being a professor include whether to accept students’ friend requests on Facebook and applying for tenure
“You’ll need to make a decision about whether or not you add students and colleagues to your social network,” Martinez said. “I was really conflicted about it — I ended up making a second Facebook profile.”
Jeff Laguna, a graduate student and teaching assistant studying gerontology, said the most rewarding part of the presentation was the reassurance that a teaching position isn’t out of reach.
“I’m a little nervous because it’s going to be about a year before I have to make this transition,” Laguna said. “Martinez’s story lets us know that it can be done — she’s a recent USC grad working at her dream job.”

After a series against California over the weekend that was one of the most exciting in memory at Dedeaux Field, with all three games being decided in the ninth inning, it would be easy for the USC baseball team to lose a bit of focus on its game against Loyola Marymount on Tuesday.
Coolin’ down · Freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley (above) will rest while freshman Nigel Nootbaar starts against Loyola Marymount. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
After all, it’s a midweek nonconference game against a sub-.500 team in the Lions (13-14). But USC coach Frank Cruz says the Trojans (19-10) can’t have that mentality and expect to compete.
“We can’t look past anyone,” Cruz said. “But that’s something I’ve really noticed about this team. They come ready to play every day.”
With an off day Sunday, the Trojans have had a bit of extra time to get ready for the Lions. LMU has won five of its last seven games but dropped the series to Brigham Young over the weekend.
Cruz specifically singled out LMU’s defensive ability. The Lions are fielding at a .973 percentage on the season, meaning the Trojans will have to hit the ball solidly to get runners on.
“It’s another Tuesday where any team could win,” Cruz said. “It’s probably going to come down to who’s more ready to play.”
As is often the case for midweek games, the starting pitcher for the Trojans is in flux until the last minute.
Cruz said he contemplated starting freshman Stephen Tarpley.
Usually the Sunday starter, Tarpley instead threw Thursday against Cal and wasn’t scheduled to start again until next Sunday, giving him a full four days rest each time.
Cruz, however, has chosen to rest his young lefty and start freshman Nigel Nootbaar, who has yet to allow a run this season — albeit with a very limited 5 2/3 innings of work.
Cruz said that Nootbaar would only go a few innings tomorrow before the game is handed over to the bullpen. He is hesitant to throw anyone for too long in order to save them for the weekend.
There could be a very interesting backstory to tonight’s game, as Cruz was the head coach at LMU from 1997-2008. Though no one currently on the Lions played for Cruz, some of the seniors there recruited were by him.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary between Friday, April 6, and Sunday, April 9.
Crimes against a person
At 12:48 a.m. on April 8, DPS officers responded to a security guard who was detaining an intoxicated student who had punched and kicked him after being denied entry to a party at the Zeta Beta Tau fraterntiy. The guard requested prosecution of the matter. The officers arrested the student and transported him to MDC for booking.
At 6:59 p.m. on April 7, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male who reported that a suspect punched him in the face during an argument outside the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. The male sustained a cut to his lip, but he declined when the officers offered to request an LAFD RA unit to provide medical treatment. He was released to seek it on his own. The suspect could not be located at the time of the report.
Crimes against property
At 11:25 p.m. on April 6, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects trespassing at the Theta Xi fraternity and refusing to leave the premises after being asked to do so. One of the subjects became combative when the officers attempted to detain him. The suspect punched two of DPS officers several times before being subdued. The suspect was then arrested and transported to MDC for booking. The second suspect was detained without incident and also booked at MDC.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 10:20 a.m. on April 8, a non-USC female reported that a suspect followed her around Superior Grocers and made inappropriate comments to her while she was shopping at the location. The female did not report the incident at the time it occurred and the suspect left the area before he could be questioned by store security or DPS officers.
At 5:16 p.m. on April 7, the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity was cited to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for members’ uncooperative and belligerent behavior toward DPS officers who shut down a party after a full bottle of water was thrown at one of them outside the location.
At 2:37 p.m. on April 7, a staff member reported that a suspect entered the women’s restroom at the Marks Tennis Stadium and attempted to look under the door of the stall that she occupied. The suspect fled when the staff member yelled at him and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
At 8:52 a.m. on April 6, a university tram driver picked up a disoriented non-USC female and dropped her off at the DPS office for assistance. The female did not know her address or phone number, but LAPD officers who responded to the scene were able to determine where she lived and transported her home.

BeWellUSC received its final video submissions Monday for its newly launched interactive wellness map that allows students to find places on campus that promote physical and spiritual wellness.
The map, which is available under the “Initiatives” section of the BeWellUSC website, features more than 30 locations on the University Park Campus dedicated to student wellness. Featured locations include Student Counseling Services, the Rose Garden in Exposition Park, the Fishbowl Chapel and the Scene Dock Theatre Patio.
Health · Student Affairs launched an interactive map on its BeWellUSC website. The map intends to encourage wellness on campus and helps users identify which locations promote physical and spiritual wellness. - Photo illustration by Daniel Rothberg
Brittany New, a health educator in the Health Promotion and Prevention Services, said the map was created to help make wellness more accessible to students.
“BeWellUSC was designed in order to make wellness more interactive for students,” New said. “USC is becoming an increasingly residential campus and we needed to start highlighting different areas on campus that students can utilize to improve their wellness.”
Each icon on the wellness map provides a brief description of the location and lists the dimensions of wellness that can be pursued there. Among the different dimensions are spiritual, emotional, intellectual and physical wellness.
New said the initiative addresses a variety of wellness aspects that students might overlook.
“A lot of times people think of health as a complete state, but it is much more about your health potential and working towards this potential in your workplace and your studies,” New said.
The Office for Wellness and Health Promotion is working to bring the map to a variety of different platforms, New said.
“Ideally, the wellness map could be housed in many other places,” New said. “Our office is also talking about creating a smart phone app for the map.”
Tori Wiggins, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said she is satisfied with the amount of wellness promoted at USC.
“USC does a good job promoting wellness through social media networks, emails and fliers around campus,” Wiggins said. “Just recently, my R.A. sent out an email about how to get in touch with our floor wellness adviser, and she is planning a dinner for us to talk with him later this month.”
Naomi Yiu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said more fitness options should be available to promote wellness.
“USC should offer more fitness alternatives for student wellness,” Yiu said. “It would be nice to be able to go to yoga classes at the Lyon Center instead of always just having to use the exercise machines.”
WTF? What a waste of time and effort. Bunch of bed wetting BS. These are adults, time for them to find their own way. It’s called the campus gym, the campus library, the campus chapel, the campus health center. That’s all I ever needed. Libs trying to make the young adults dependent and wussified.

A research team partnered with USC received a $10-million grant from the National Science Foundation last week to build “socially assistive” robots that will aid developmental goals for preschool-age children, according to a statement released by the Viterbi School of Engineering.
The grant from the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering was one of four new Expeditions in Computing awards.
The research team, led by investigator from Yale University, will attempt to develop robots to supplement the work of caregivers and teachers. The robots will be developed to establish long-term relationships with children to help them with developmental goals, such as reading and surmounting disabilities. The researchers plan to achieve their goal by modeling social interaction and creating new algorithms to give the robots a wide behavioral range.
Maja Mataric, a professor of computer science, neuroscience, and pediatrics, and vice dean for research at Viterbi, will serve as a co-principal investigator.
“I am thrilled to have the importance and promise of this work recognized by the Expedition Award,” Mataric said in the statement.  “The term ‘socially assitive robots’ was defined in our Interaction Lab at USC in 2004.”
The research team is made up of 17 principal investigators from USC, Yale University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford. The investigators’ areas of expertise include computer science, robotics, educational theory and developmental psychology.
Will there be a robot wellness website as well?

Sunsets, TMZ and whether or not USC quarterback Matt Barkley highlights his hair were just a few of the topics discussed at the panel Communicating with the Media on Monday.
USC’s branch of national honor society Lambda Pi Eta hosted the discussion delving into athletes’ interaction with the press and social media.
Sports talk · Dan Durbin, director of Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society, and quarterback Matt Barkley, a junior majoring in communication, discussed on Monday athletes’ interactions with the media. - Lisa Parker | Daily Trojan
Tim Tessalone, USC’s sports information director, began the discussion by contrasting the sports journalism of today with the field when he first started working for USC in 1979.
“Media were almost like lapdogs to athletes back then,” Tessalone said. “Athletes were idols. They were on a pedestal, and anything bad that happened, the media looked the other way.”
Tessalone said now anything athletes do or say could be criticized and analyzed by the media.
Becoming a public figure is something Barkley, a junior majoring in communication, said he has struggled to learn how to handle.
“You really have to watch what you say at all times because you never know who is going to snap a picture,” Barkley said. “And anything you see on the Internet is there forever.”
Dan Durbin, director of the Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society, said part of the reason why student-athletes face so much media scrutiny is because of the notoriety of USC.
“USC is one of the two or three marquis sports institutions in all of Southern California, including professional teams,” Durbin said. “You [student-athletes] are a sports star in Southern California whether you want to be or not.”
Finding a balance between being a normal college student and a semi-professional athlete is something Barkley said he deals with through Twitter.
He not only tweets in support of his team after football games, but also posts tweets about computers and “geek stuff,” Instagram pictures of sunsets and even settles rumors about his natural blond hair.
“I like to let the fans see a part of me that they wouldn’t normally see unless they were around Heritage Hall all the time,” Barkley said.
Barkley’s Twitter can also be a tool for official USC sports communication, Tessalone said.
“We had him [Barkley] tweet when we hired one of our assistant football coaches, and he broke the news via Twitter,” Tessalone said.
Athletes’ social media image can be important to more than just their portrayal in the press. For Barkley, it could make or break his chances to win the Heisman Trophy next year, Durbin said.
“It’s a political campaign, it’s a beauty contest — you have to look pretty at the right times,” Durbin said.
Just as Barkley has had to learn to deal with the media in his college experience, students who attended the event said they learned from his commentary.
“It was a fantastic learning experience to get a great point of view from someone inside the Trojan sports family,” said Juliann Johnson, a freshman majoring in public relations. “It’s much different from what I expected.”
Annenberg students also said they felt the event augmented their journalism education.
“I appreciate the opportunity Annenberg is giving the audience to learn about sports, social media and journalism,” said Alyssa Nakamoto, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism.
Though his football career forced Barkley to become aware of his image on social media much sooner than his peers will become aware of theirs, he said the experience is something everyone will have to go through.
“The number one rule on the team is to protect the team, and if you have that in mind when you are on your phone or computer, you know if something you are going to send out is going to hurt the team,” Barkley said. “It makes you aware; you have to be on your guard and be careful. Your words are immortalized now.”

This is a story about a very public love affair involving the rich and famous. Power grabs, gossip and suspicion lurk at every turn. An attention-starved, oft-jealous and never-boring woman stands at the center of it all.
It’s a story that sounds like something out of the nearest tabloid or stupidly popular reality show. Alas, this particular tale goes back a few more years than your average celebrity wedding or political sex scandal. Be it the 2000-plus years since the events transpired or the 400-plus since William Shakespeare adapted the tale for the stage, the story of Antony and Cleopatra has been around for a very long time, and theater company A Noise Within has staged this lesser-known tragedy in its new Pasadena playhouse to exciting results.

Spanning from the lavish royal palace in Egypt to the politically charged Roman Senate, the play covers the whirlwind romance of Roman general Mark Antony and Queen of Egypt Cleopatra VII in the middle of a massive power shift. The Roman Republic is on the brink of becoming the Roman Empire, which became the dominant force in the world for 500 years.
Antony is part of a triumvirate in charge of the Roman Republic, but instead of being in Rome solidifying the unstable political situation, he is completely enraptured by the famous Cleopatra — in the process ignoring his wife and his duties and enraging his co-triumvir, the ambitious Octavius Caesar.
Upon finally returning to Rome for his first wife’s funeral, he finds a new partner — Caesar’s sister, who Antony pursues in an attempt to strengthen his and Caesar’s bond.
It would have been a politically savvy move if it weren’t for Antony’s blind love for Cleopatra. Soon, Antony’s feelings for the queen get the better of him and he returns to Egypt, leading to a war with Caesar and a tragic ending for himself and Cleopatra.
Like many others, this tragedy has the central characters doomed from the beginning — but there’s something different about Antony and Cleopatra. Unlike the breathless, childlike infatuation of Romeo and Juliet, this play revolves around a much more self-aware, mature and realistic relationship. Where the adolescent lovers from Verona stay at the same infatuated lunacy throughout Romeo and Juliet, the middle-aged heroes of Antony and Cleopatra run through a huge spectrum of emotions. From jubilation to jealousy, paranoia to fury, anguish and shame, the characters suffer highs and lows together that require a certain degree of acting chops to execute convincingly.
The actors from A Noise Within perform this job admirably. Susan Angelo, the actress who portrays Cleopatra, launches into the absolute roller-coaster of a personality the queen possesses in the play. Angelo is able to jump from giggling at the death of Antony’s wife in one scene to torturing a messenger for bringing her the news of Antony’s new marriage in the next.
Geoff Elliott, also one of the two directors of the production, plays Cleopatra’s counterpart Antony with the same expertise, as he goes from being pulled along by his hyperactive lover to falling into despair at his failures on the battlefield.
Max Rosnak and USC alumnus Amin El Gamal steal their share of scenes as well, the former as Caesar and the latter as Mardian, a musically talented eunuch.
One surprise strength of the show — and one of the first things you notice about it — is the set. At first glance, it appears minimalistic, with pipes visible at every corner and adorned only with some drapes, pillows and a small pool — overall very bare.
The set takes advantage of what’s already there: The pipe structure, for instance, is integrated throughout the play as actors climb up the sides of sets and duck and dart between columns. The entire space is used, and the play often spills from the stage into the aisles, around the circumference of the stage and, in a couple of especially impressive scenes, into the air above the audience’s heads as the actors swing around on ropes during unexpectedly thrilling battle scenes.
This is an extremely physical rendition as far as Shakespearean plays go, and it works with the surroundings magnificently. The experience of not knowing from which direction information is to be gleaned fits very well with a story in which many of the characters are themselves struggling with which way to turn next, with news of great events coming over great distances.
The production takes on a lesser known work but jumps into it and the impactful events it portrays with aplomb. The sets and actors combine for a show so packed in energy, scandal and action that it will appeal to devout followers of Shakespeare’s works and casual fans alike.

If a show airs in its time slot and no one is tuned in to watch it, does it make a sound?
It’s an “if a tree falls in a forest” question that most network executives would be perfectly happy going their whole careers without ever discovering the answer to. Countless dollars are spent every season to generate buzz about new launches and to pump up the hype for new seasons of returners to avoid discovering the answer to that proverbial question.
Quirky gimmick · Zooey Deschanel’s (above) character Jess on FOX’s new hit comedy New Girl has been marketed as “adorkable” in an attempt to draw viewers in with her cute and nerdy eccentricities. - Photo courtesy of FOX
No matter what your mother, your librarian or the anthropomorphic cricket who serves as your conscience might have told you about judging a book by its cover, similar warnings against snap judgments don’t hold true in TV. The way a show is promoted in print or on air is generally an accurate indicator of what the show itself is like — as well as how you’ll like it.
Pains are usually taken to make sure that a show’s ad campaign is in keeping with the tone of the show itself. The quick cuts and shaky footage comprising the on-air spots for ABC’s The River, for instance, alerted potential viewers to the type of journey they were in for, should they decide to tune in. As for narrative style, the purposefully un-illuminating  promos proved to be accurate representations of the show itself, which, like the network’s recent hit Lost, sometimes leaves audiences with more questions at the end of an episode than they had at the beginning.
“Adorkable,” the now-infamous neologism coined in an effort to promote New Girl on Fox, wasn’t just eminently mockable and vexingly unforgettable. The willful cutesiness and self-aware quirkiness suggested by that “simply adorkable” tagline are delivered week-in and week-out on the show. In fact, New Girl’s star is so pointedly free-spirited as to warrant a repeated sketch on Saturday Night Live, “Bein’ Quirky with Zooey Deschanel.”
Even when an ad campaign falls short of giving would-be viewers a feel for the mood and tone of a show, it usually at least gives an idea of what the show is going for. Early promos for Gossip Girl on the CW clearly sought to capitalize on the allure of the forbidden by pairing a provocative still with an inflammatory condemnation of the show — “mind-blowingly inappropriate,” “a nasty piece of work,” “every parent’s nightmare” — by the likes of the Parents Television Council and the Boston Herald. Playing up parental disapproval was completely in character for a show that fancies itself much more scandalous than it’s ever actually been.
Among the more iconic campaigns in recent memory was the starkly minimalist one used to tout the current season of AMC’s Mad Men. The silhouette of a man in a suit falling through a vast expanse of negative space was the only image used in the ads; the only text was the date of the season premiere — the name of the show or the network it aired on appeared nowhere in the original ads.
Many thought the image (which was taken directly from the title sequence Mad Men has used since 2007) bore an uncomfortable resemblance to chilling photos from the World Trade Center attacks of victims falling to their deaths. Disregarding the allegations of insensitivity with which the ads were initially met, however, the decision to stage such a spare campaign speaks volumes about the show.
The self-confidence implied by a wordless ad campaign after a year-and-a-half hiatus is astonishing, but it’s an absolutely on-point characterization of how Mad Men sees itself and how it treats its fans.
There’s a certain measure of trust that fans of the show would return, even if they had no idea what to expect in the coming season — or that’s how the show’s creator Matt Weiner sees it, at least.
Just like Game of Thrones’ “War Is Coming” campaign, which references a line from the HBO fantasy series’ first season, “Winter is coming,” Mad Men’s intentionally enigmatic campaign asks something from its audience. Game of Thrones’ foreknowledge-dependent billboards rely on an insider’s knowledge of the show for the ads to make sense, whereas Mad Men’s controversial “falling man” ads required not only previous awareness, but also previous interest in the show. Fans’ voracious appetites for more information manifested when the show eventually debuted an image of the show’s antihero, Don Draper, window-shopping — a firestorm of speculation as to the image’s symbolic meaning engulfed the Internet for days.
Promotional campaigns serve a range of purposes besides simply drawing viewers in. CBS’ Two and a Half Men heralded the addition of Ashton Kutcher while simultaneously reassuring existing fans that the show would go on post-Charlie Sheen by reprising a photo shoot of the titular men and half-man in suits, singing into a microphone in front of a red curtain, that was used to promote the original cast members years before.
ABC is intentionally consolidating ads for Desperate Housewives and GCB to ease the transition from one show to the next, as the current season will be Housewives’ last. In advertising Community’s return last month, NBC even specifically urged audiences to “Watch It Live” in an effort to boost ratings for the struggling cult favorite.
Ulterior motives notwithstanding, the primary objective of a promotional campaign is to give audiences a taste of a show’s vibe and sensibilities and hope they respond to it. With so many options available in today’s television landscape, sometimes a cover is all you have time to judge. But with promos putting a show’s best face forward, that’s not always so bad.

Inspired by the book, Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey Into a Minor Hockey League, Goon tells the story of an up-and-coming hockey player. Though the film stars Sean William Scott, it is not Stifler-on-ice. In fact, Goon has the opportunity to be Scott’s breakout role from being typecast as the crazy partier that every group of friends has.
Game over · Though Sean William Scott delivers an entertaining and convincing performance in Goon, the film fails to find its footing. - Photo courtesy of Magnet Releasing
The film focuses on Doug Glatt’s (Scott) search for a new career and the acceptance and pride of his father, played by Eugene Levy. Levy and Scott also worked together throughout the American Pie movie series, with the latest installment American Reunion now playing in theaters.
The film starts in Massachusetts, with Doug utilizing his undeniable ability to give and take a beating as a bouncer. When Doug and his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) attend a hockey game and Doug gets in a fight with one of the players, he draws the attention of a coach and is soon picked up by the Halifax Highlanders, a minor league team in need of a morale boost after its star player (Xavier Laflamme) has lost his confidence and the team’s losing streak appears to be ever-lengthening.
The subplot of Ross “The Boss” Rhea (Liev Schreiber), a fellow hockey goon, and his impending retirement give the film just enough drama to keep the audience’s attention as the film builds to the inevitable fight: rookie versus veteran. Doug sees Ross as a potential mentor, and their mutual understanding of what happens on the ice is separate from their personal feelings for one another, demonstrating the sportsmanship that is missing from professional sports nowadays.
In a movie about hockey and the game’s enforcers, violence is expected, and Goon does not disappoint. The opening and closing shots of the film are dripping with blood and lost teeth, the symbol of any good hockey fight.
The gore is most graphic when Doug comes into his own on the ice and ends up blocking a goal with his face. As the puck falls and the blood covers the screen, Quentin Tarantino’s films come to mind, but the scarcity of these scenes throughout the film makes the violence inconsistent. Gore is not used excessively for any kind of comedic effect, as Tarantino would do, but it isn’t used lightly enough to take at face value. With the only remnants being a few bruises throughout the movie, the importance of the violence in comparison to Doug’s emotional journey is disproportional, making the audience unsure of the tone of the film.
Following the unrealistic precedent of other hockey movies, the fights in Goon are over the top. In professional hockey, the slightest inkling of a kick can have a player suspended for multiple games. In Goon, a referee allows the final fight to continue, even encourages it, until Doug can no longer stand on his previously broken ankle — oh, right, in addition to stopping a goal with his face, while he’s on the ground, Doug gets stomped on by an opposing player, with no repercussions to anyone involved — all for the sake of Rhea’s “last stand.”
Scott’s portrayal of Doug as a man appreciative of his experience is the film’s finest attribute. His sincerity and willingness to do anything for his team is a touching, refreshing aspect of Scott’s performance. Scott commands attention through simplicity, and the honesty prevalent in Doug’s persona gives Scott the chance to evolve past the American Pie character that made him famous.
Unfortunately, Scott is partnered with Baruchel as co-leads. Baruchel, a co-writer of the screenplay, had the opportunity to write himself his dream role, and he chose a lewd hoodlum who doesn’t have a single scene without multiple f-bombs and perverted hand gestures. Baruchel is supposed to be comic relief in the film but ends up coming off as a Stifler-impersonator, and not a very good one.
Levy’s persona as a funnyman is underplayed in the film, giving Scott the opportunity to command scenes more effectively. But in the end, Levy is a missed opportunity for greatness in the film. In the few scenes that Levy is in, he portrays the shame of having a son deemed unsuccessful convincingly, but with a lack of that Levy-pizzazz that has made him such a draw for moviegoers.
Directed by Michael Dowse, the movie continually dances between the borders of comedy, Tarantino-esque gore and drama. From start to end, Doug’s insecurity is unfortunately translated to the tone and direction of the film, making its 90-minute run-time seem much longer as the audience and Dowse wrestle with what they want the film to be in the end.
What’s clear is that Scott as Doug Glatt measures up to the hype; unfortunately, even with comparisons to The Mighty Ducks and Slapshot, Goon does not.

Corruption, lust and murder — welcome to the Vatican of the Italian Renaissance. Showtime’s second season of The Borgias continues the saga of the notorious Spanish family and its machinations in 15th-century Rome. If Sunday’s premiere was any indicator, the second season looks even more promising than the first.
The first season of The Borgias followed the family’s rise to power. Rodrigo Borgia (Jeremy Irons) became Pope Alexander VI, named his son Cesare (François Arnaud) a cardinal and annulled his daughter Lucrezia’s (Holliday Grainger) marriage to a brutish nobleman. The central conflict was the Borgias’ fight to stay alive after Cardinal Della Rovere (Colm Feore), an avatar for Vatican justice, talked the King of France into attacking Rome. A dash of quick thinking, bribery and Lucrezia’s brave intervention staved off the French and drove Della Rovere into hiding.

In the second season, with their power secure, the Borgias have fewer outside enemies — and thus fight more among themselves. The simmering rivalry between Cesare and his hedonist older brother Juan (David Oakes) boils over into open fighting. Rodrigo’s mistress, Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek), has realized that even her beauty and kindness aren’t enough to keep his eyes off other Italian strumpets. Lucrezia, meanwhile, cares for her illegitimate son and tries not to think about the next grubby noble she might have to marry.
Season one of The Borgias had several strengths. Creator Neil Jordan captured Renaissance-era Rome as a beautiful, ancient figure with seeping cracks of corruption. The visuals were gorgeous, especially for television. The costumes and sets were striking and lush. The acting was strong for the most part — Granger as Lucrezia’s character arc from sweet, precocious child to angel-faced manipulator was especially compelling.
Yet, the series wobbled with first-season indecisiveness — was it a gritty historical drama á la HBO’s Rome, or a history-flouting Harlequin fling akin to Showtime’s The Tudors? For so much subterfuge and violence, the story was sometimes cold and apathetic. In its second season, The Borgias appears to have a better handle on its direction, which seems to lean closer to Rome than The Tudors.
The strong points of season one have all received upgrades. Rome is as impressive as ever, considering much of it was actually filmed near Budapest. The camera work has improved too: The brothers have a close-quarters swordfight that drips with swashbuckling awesomeness and foretells bloodier confrontations to come; a rough horserace is tightly shot and exciting.
With a season for the cast members to grow into their characters, the acting now feels more even, and the writing has clipped some of its filler in favor of performance. Now, characters have greater opportunities to be more conflicted and less schizophrenic.
History remembers the Borgias as cruel and cunning manipulators. Rumors of poison, incest and corruption dogged the family even before Rodrigo keeled over and took his family’s power with him.
But no one is a villain in their own story.
Rodrigo is an intriguing character: He chides his cardinals for their austerity and speaks of bringing more joy into worship. Whether this is a genuine wish for reform, or an excuse to throw wild parties, is unclear. In one snarky scene, he cradles his infant grandson, hissing at a French diplomat to keep his voice down. In another, he beds a female apprentice artist with the silent threat that he could reveal her female identity to her master. Somehow, amid his self-delusion and vice, he loves his family and sees himself as a man of God, with no feelings of hypocrisy.
His son, Cesare, is less sure of himself. Is he a good man who often does bad things or an evil man who sometimes does good? He does not know. Conventional history brands him, at best, as an intelligent villain, but this gray area is far more interesting.
Even murkier than his penchant for knives and a friendship with a child-killing assassin is Cesare’s relationship with his sister Lucrezia. Rumors and propaganda have suggested how close the siblings were. Often their scenes are the sweetest in the series — a spark of platonic affection unmarred by their family’s corruption. But is there nothing creepy about asking Lucrezia if he should be jealous of her stable boy lover? Let the speculation fly.
The first season of The Borgias was far better than many other shows in 2011, but it had the misfortune of premiering the same year as HBO’s violent and devious Game of Thrones. Though Game of Thrones is a superior series in scope and writing, The Borgias was dealt a colder hand than it deserved. The show’s second-season opener surpasses its first in every way and is a very promising start to the season.
 
The Borgias airs on Showtime on Sundays at 10pm.

The university should  permit alcohol sales at baseball games.
Drinking and watching sports are synonymous. A jumbo ballpark hot dog, a bag of peanuts and a nice cold beer is what watching a baseball game is all about. It is the American tradition that the beautiful sport of baseball was built upon.
In fact, baseball was the first professional sport that permitted the sale of beer at the stadium. By preventing the sale of beer at baseball games, USC is taking away from the fans experience of the great game and its effect can be seen in the stands.
With proper restrictions, the sale of beer at USC baseball games will provide a safer, more involved atmosphere at the games. If this policy were implemented, not only would attendance increase but revenue would as well. An increase of revenue will further result in more funding for a better program, which USC is desperately in need of.
USC is traditionally a powerhouse school when it comes to baseball, producing professional athletes such as Mark McGwire, Randy Johnson and Barry Zito. Unfortunately, in the last few years the program has declined and simultaneously so has attendance. The administration is in the right by having concerns with serving beer at a college sport. Beyond the looming fear of students becoming intoxicated, the university also has to be concerned with parents drinking heavily, driving under the influence and an overall unsafe environment at the games.
If beer were to be sold in a controlled environment, however, these concerns would be eliminated. As with other universities, fans will be limited a certain number of beers. The University of Arizona only allows two cold ones at the time of purchase and has stopped allowing fans re-entry to prevent consumption outside of the stadium. A fact the university needs to accept is that fans are going to drink whether it is allowed or not.
A few weeks ago, the USC administration was faced with the task of voting upon this policy. Though it was close, USC ruled in favor of continuing to prohibit the sale of beer at USC baseball games. The ruling was disappointing not only to fans but to the players as well.
While USC fears it will encourage fans and students to drink heavily, West Virginia University implemented the sale of beer and projected an increase of $1 million in annual revenue that would directly funnel to the athletic program.
With a struggling coaching staff, mediocre recruiting classes and an overall crumbling program, USC baseball could use the extra funds. USC needs to let the great game be enjoyed the American way, the way we all know and love. A hot dog in one hand, a cold beer in the other and some crunched peanut shells beneath our feet.

good try. All UofA will see is more DUI’s as students return to campus from it’s off campus stadium. 
SC has enough emotion at many of it’s traditional rivalries. Alcohol puts too many over the edge.
Stick with caffeine!

In a high-stakes professional situation, such as choosing an insurance company for a client or making investment decisions, there is little room for poor judgment.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
It is the challenge of learning judgment at school that helps us understand our limitations before we enter the business world after graduation.
We can improve our capacity for good judgment early on by examining the choices we make in college — our successes as well as our mistakes.
Good judgment is often subjective and hard to quantify. It’s hard to say where judgment comes from. Critical thinking and analytical skill are essential subsets of good judgment; and we practice them all the time in college.
But it’s clear that our family, friends, community, values and personal character are equally important in the judgments and decisions that we make but are much more difficult to study.
Unfortunately, it’s extremely difficult to teach students how to make a good judgment call in the classroom, simply because good judgment is subjective.
Also, outside of the classroom there is a huge range of judgment calls that students can learn from.
For example, the Associated Press reported last week that in 2010 a group of federal employees blew $823,000 on a five-day conference in Las Vegas. The employees stayed in luxury hotel suites, threw private parties catered by room service and spent $75,000 for a team-building exercise. The conference violated federal contracting regulations and far exceeded the government’s meal budget of $71 a day.
How many taxpayers can afford to spend more than $71 per day on meals?
This is not an indication of a lack of critical thinking or analytical skills. It was simply a lapse in judgment.
Those employees who did not exercise good judgment are now seeking new employment.
But what about when a judgment call isn’t so black and white?
On March 30, The Wall Street Journal published an article about a man who claims to save his company a few thousand dollars in cab fare by biking to meetings in cities such as New York City and Mumbai.
Yet he expensed the $180 Dahon bicycle, bought on sale, to his private-equity firm.
The image of someone showing up for an important business meeting drenched in sweat and the distinctive odor of hard physical work seems unprofessional.
In an August 2010 Harvard Business Review guest blog post, Brook Manville argued that a critical piece of the judgment puzzle is experience. Case studies can act as substitutes to some extent, but real-life experience will never be supplanted by texts. It is up to students to be aware of the complexity of judgment and to seek out experience now in order to be better prepared for a future career.
In a competitive work environment post-graduation, snap judgment skills are essential for people in positions of responsibility — which is where USC students want to be, isn’t it?

The example of the wasted tax payer money was more of a lack of respect then it was lack of judgement. They knew they were doing wrong.

The Women of Troy split a pair of Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference matches on the road this weekend, defeating No. 8 San Jose State 8-5 on Friday before falling 9-8 in overtime to No. 2 Stanford on Saturday.
The road trip wrapped up USC’s conference schedule a week earlier than most teams, as the Women of Troy (18-4, 5-2) can only sit and wait to see where they’ll end up in the final conference standings before the MPSF tournament.
The Women of Troy currently sit in third place, but could move into a tie for second place if the Cardinal (19-1, 5-0) beat No. 1 UCLA (16-2, 5-1) in a matchup of the nation’s two top-ranked teams on April 21.
USC still had a chance to tie for first-place before this weekend, but had those hopes crushed with they close loss to Stanford.
Sophomore two-meter Madeline Rosenthal scored with 2:21 left in the third period to cap a 4-0 USC run that stretched over halftime to give the Women of Troy a 6-3 lead.
But the Cardinal responded with two goals to cut the lead to one heading into the final period.
Sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell struck to give USC a 7-5 lead, but Stanford quickly knocked in a pair of goals once again to tie it up at 7-7 with 5:49 left.
Both defenses held strong for the rest of regulation, forcing overtime in Palo Alto.
Stanford came out swinging in the extra period, putting in two goals in the first minute for a 9-7 lead.
Rosenthal scored her third goal of the match with just over three minutes left, but USC couldn’t convert again and fell 9-8 to the host Cardinal.
It was the second time the Women of Troy lost by one goal to the Cardinal in their home pool this season- they lost 8-7 to them in the Stanford Invitational in a non-conference match back on February 4.
USC has now lost six in a row to Stanford, but the Women of Troy may have a chance to exact revenge on the Cardinal in the MPSF tournament.
The Women of Troy’s first match of the weekend was a different story, as they never trailed against San Jose State (14-10, 2-5) in an 8-5 victory.
USC also defeated the Spartans 14-6 in its season opener, and now holds a 25-0 all-time record against San Jose State.
Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist led the Women of Troy with two goals, and sophomore goalie Flora Bolonyai recorded 10 saves for a .667 save percentage.
The Women of Troy now have nearly two weeks off before wrapping up the regular season with a home nonconference match against CSU-Bakersfield on April 20 at 5 p.m.
Trojans will exact revenge in MPSF.
Fight On!

USC Radio has reached an agreement to purchase KCNL, a San Jose-area Spanish talk and music station, for $7.5 million. The agreement continues USC’s statewide expansion, wherein KUSC will convert KCNL 104.9 to a non-commercial classical music station.
USC will acquire the station from Principle Broadcasting Network San Jose, LLC, owned by Charles Banta, according to Federal Communication Commission documents. The agreement is pending approval from the FCC.
Brenda Barnes, the president of USC Radio, said there has been an increase of USC alumni moving into the Bay Area and a USC-owned KCNL can help alumni stay connected to the university.
“With the exception of Southern California, the most important region to USC when it comes to connecting with alumni and parents is the Bay Area,” Barnes said.
This is not the first time USC has bought a radio station in the Bay Area. USC purchased San Francisco stations KUSF and KDFC in January 2011. Students of the University of San Francisco launched a yearlong movement protesting USC’s purchase of the college radio station and KUSC’s plans to transform KUSF into an all-classical music station by July 2012. The deal to acquire KUSF is still pending.
In contrast, USC’s acquisition of KCNL has met far less opposition. According to Barnes, when USC first announced plans to buy KCNL, the university received thousands of emails for several weeks, applauding USC’s continued expansion into the Bay Area.
“Everyone was really thrilled with USC making the change and we received lots of letters from alumni living in the Bay Area who said they really want to hear USC radio,” Barnes said.
In addition to reaching out to alumni, Barnes said the university believes that broadcasting USC radio into the Bay Area helps attract prospective students and their parents.
“It’s about recruiting, branding and expanding the Trojan Family,” Barnes said.
Though KCNL will become a non-commercial classical music station like KUSC, its programming will differ from what USC Radio broadcasts in Southern California. KCNL, as well as KDFC, will air music from the San Francisco Symphony and other Bay Area classical music ensembles. KUSC will continue to broadcast the music of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Opera and Chamber Orchestra to approximately 800,000 listeners every week, Barnes said.
USC plans to begin broadcasting from KCNL this spring if the FCC approves the sale.
Many in San Francisco are still lamenting USC’s robbery of our community radio station frequency, 90.3FM KUSF, once served by volunteer DJs.
Radio stations ought to about more than connecting with alumni.  They ought to be about serving a community.

Jay Electronica is the greatest rapper you’ve never heard of. If you have heard the name, then it’s likely that you haven’t heard enough of him and not because you haven’t been listening, but because his releases have been sparse and his live appearances elusive. Adjectives to describe his rapping abilities: sophisticated, explosive and otherworldly. Adjectives to describe the man: humble, informed and genuine. Fuse the man and the musician and witness a creative genius.
Fans were privileged enough to be fed by Electronica Sunday when a finalized version of a track called “Dear Moleskine” was released online. The track originally appeared on Electronica’s YouTube page in 2009 and it seems that this version will be included on his next release.
Timothy Elpadaro Thedford hails from the Magnolia Projects of New Orleans, Louisiana where his musical inclinations were first inspired by marching bands. He has been rapping since age 10 (he is now 35), something he believes makes him either delusional or really good. That’s his humility talking because he’s ridiculously good.
Electronica first came to attention in 2007 when he released a nine-minute song built by looping Jon Brion’s movie soundtrack to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind called Eternal Sunshine: The Pledge.
After a string of releases, Electronica was thrust back into the public eye with a Just Blaze produced track called “Exhibit C”. Other notable releases from Electronica include collaboration with English band The Bullitts for a short film/song called “Run and Hide”.
A short commercial for New Balance featuring Electronica appeared online in early February, suggesting his emergence from seclusion and stoking rumors of his soon to be released album via Jay-Z’s label imprint Roc Nation. Then in early March, Electronica announced that his debut album Act 2: Patents of Nobility (The Turn) had been finished. It seems now that it is only a matter of time before the world gets familiar with the supernatural talent of Electronica.
