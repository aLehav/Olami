I actually wore a sweater this week! Finally. But it was a short-lived celebration that quickly resulted in what would be a classic scene from Punk’d. Although Ashton Kutcher wasn’t there to personally laugh at me, the overcast clouds clearing out before noon was indication enough that I had made the wrong outfit choice. 
We are already halfway through October and still experiencing hot summer weather. I normally would not complain about it, but I left my high school in Arizona to avoid the heat and it seems to have followed me. But while the weather might not be quite as I would like it, something that is nearly perfect is my schedule of classes for next spring – my last semester of classes at USC. (No pressure!) 
That might not have been the smoothest transition, but hey, we have to keep it pushin’ when I only have 600 words to wrap this all up for you guys like a Chipotle burrito. 
Being a senior, I’m constantly stressed out. But that’s nothing new. I’ve always been a nervous Nancy. SOS! Now it’s just on a new level – Am I working enough hours? Am I involved enough on campus? Am I networking enough? And the most recent: Am I picking the best classes I can to register for?
We all know the popular classes are the first to fill up and it hasn’t been until this year that I had a prime registration date: Halloween! Guess it’s a treat, not a trick on me. I won’t reveal too many details about my future class schedule because I don’t want to induce a registration frenzy and then be left in the dust. I have one more class I have to take to complete my major, which means that my other 14-16 units can be filled with electives (A.K.A. classes you hope will be easy and interesting, but you still have to write a paper or two and take a final in).
I have always wanted to take a psychology class, so I intend to take not one but two of the most popular ones next semester, in addition to the film symposium class where you get to watch movies weeks before they release to the public. It felt like a “two birds, one stone” type of deal. I get my class credits and I get to see movies for the free 99 – and we all know L.A. Live ain’t cheap. Sign me up!
I’m also debating taking yoga and a class about redesigning my life so I can reach my creative potential. All of them sound very fun and interesting and after surviving Earthquakes and Planet Earth as my science GE’s I more than deserve it. Readers and registers beware: Typically the only people that pass those classes with anything more than a C are the kids that won the Science Fair for designing some machine that defies the laws of physics. You also have to take a two-hour bus ride to JPL and the site of fault lines (information you’ll never use after you graduate) and because I took both these earth-related classes, I had to go twice. Three words: No Me Gusta!
My only saving grace that day was the fact that I was still drunk from an outing my old roommate and I had gone on the night before. Rocks and nature can be pretty interesting when you’re under the influence, but if not, you better have a pension for peridotite. Awww, memories.
So to anyone registering soon, may the odds be ever in your favor. And freshmen…well, your time will come.

Midterm season has begun! Although it feels like we have only been in school for a couple of days, the reality is that we are halfway finished with the Fall semester. I know that when I flipped the page in my weekly planner yesterday my heart quite literally skipped a beat. Three midterms in the same week? Impossible. I frantically checked all of my syllabi only to have my worst nightmare confirmed. Even though I most definitely did panic, you don’t have to! Instead of studying for my own midterms, I have conducted research and created the ultimate stress relieving list for midterms. Ace your midterms and control your stress this season!
Stay happy and healthy during this season of midterms! Best of luck to all.

Imagine lying on a rooftop, in pitch black, gazing at the stars. Your zenith is the Milky Way galaxy, a visual cloud of clustered stars with a faint color of silver and deep purple. This mesmerizing sight was my view for two nights in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the largest mountain range in Africa.
Atlas views.
At an elevation of over 8,000 feet, I spent three days in the agricultural village of Zawiyat Ahansal feasting on traditional food made of local produce, teaching Amazigh children, hiking, and dancing with Atlas Ahidous dancers.
Zawiyat Ahansal consists of four smaller villages: Amezray, Aguddim, Taghia and Tighanimin. Founded in the 13th century by a Sufi Islamic scholar named Sidi Said Ahansal, historically, pilgrims would travel here to ask for blessings on the grave of Saint Ahansal. About 15,000 native Amazigh people live here and predominantly speak Tamazight.
Inside the founder’s home.
My favorite aspect of the trip was volunteering with the Atlas Cultural Foundation, a U.S. based NGO and Les Amis de Amezray, a French NGO, both of which focus on Amazigh cultural preservation, community health, education and environment.
Around 9 a.m. my group went on the most beautiful trek to the school in a neighboring village. The lush river roared above the rocks and the sun crept over the vast mountain range. Much of the trail was unpaved over jagged rocks, and yet children take this route to school every day. This small trek reminded me of a Netflix documentary I saw, which depicts children going to school around the world. Some of them walk for hours upon hours everyday through rigorous terrain to receive instruction. 
Walking to the school.
I witnessed firsthand the universality of education and how it is translated into a multiplicity of languages. I believe it is incredibly important around the globe to enlighten and empower the coming generations.
At the school, we rotated with groups of kids aged five to fifteen. Some of us taught math, English vocabulary, grammar, art, etc. This school was created by ACF and the Amezray Foundation as a tutoring center for local children. They attend the two government schools in the villages and are taught in Tamazight for a portion of the day then migrate to the tutoring center to receive additional instruction. I was surprised to find that these kids, living in a rural village about 50 miles from the nearest city knew more English than many adults I’ve met in Rabat, the capital. Many of the kids have learned English through partnerships with international organizations and volunteers who help year round. 
Much reform has been made in the education system in Zawiyat Ahansal. ACF’s program manager told me that prior to 2015, only one government school existed in all four of the villages. Many children would drop out because of the long trek, financial strains, lack of emphasis on the importance of education by parents, or the preference to keep girls to at home. 
There has been a shift in the value and emphasis placed on education through push from NGOs,  and a secondary and dormitory school are currently under construction, which allow the children to stay at the school all week, then return home on the weekends.  
After we finished teaching, the children gathered on the porch of the school and their eyes lit up as we handed out candy and snacks to them.
We smile and say Tagineeeeeee.
Seeing their smiling faces and participating in the education in the lives of these Moroccan children makes grateful to have made even the smallest impact on their lives. Even if I didn’t, this experience widened my perspective on the education system in rural villages and the successful impact international NGOs can have when partnered with local organizations.
Zawiyat Ahansal is considered the second poorest region in all of Morocco, but i do not believe they are poor. Their lack of financial assets are compensated by rich in family values, sense of community, and self-sustainability–tribal principles–that have led this village to prosper for hundreds of years. What I’ve realized is that some of the “poorest” people are the happiest people.
A moment of reflection.
This trip was extremely humbling and made me realize how privileged I am to be in a position where I have the opportunity to travel and educate others. Now that I am back in Rabat, I teach English at a local tutoring center once a week with my colleagues. Rather than creating a classroom environment where we lecture the whole time and they listen, we’ve created a language exchange where we learn new Arabic words as they learn new English words. By the end of the semester, I hope to have helped them reach their language goals, as I hope to with mine.

As an undecided freshman who had – and still has- no idea what she wants to study or what she wants to be, freshman orientation was crazy, absolutely crazy. I was completely unsure about what I wanted to study and had no idea what a GE was. So here is my completely random schedule that consists of GE after GE: Spanish 150, Climate Change,Wireless Computing Technologies for Medicine with Legal and Ethical Implications, and Law, Politics, and Public Policy.   
When I walked into the registration room at 12:50 with my laptop and the perfect schedule on my desktop, I thought my dream schedule would be a reality at 1:00 p.m.–but I was wrong. I did not get any of the GE classes I wanted because (1) I did not realize some of the classes consisted of a lecture and discussion and (2) I did not sign up quickly enough to get the GSEM I wanted. Resultantly, I had to completely redo my schedule and I panicked. I thought to myself, “here goes another year of no classes that I like.” Unfortunately, that statement could not be more true. 
I am not a math or science person by any means and I was not looking forward to taking those classes. I thought why not take those GE’s when I am a senior and it does not really matter. But somehow I ended up being persuaded by an OA (orientation advisor) to take a quantitative reasoning and physical science GE after my schedule bounced. My only requirement was to take Spanish because for some odd reason undecided students are required to do this before declaring a major!
Since I am horrible at math, I decided to take Wireless Computing Technologies for Medicine with Legal and Ethical Implications because I thought I would not have to do “real” math and I would get to learn about the crazy world of technology. Honestly, I could not be more glad I am taking it because it is a small class and so I have gotten to make lots of friends and learn a lot. 
I decided to take Climate Change because I hear about it all the time on the news and I wanted to know what really does it mean. The class is hard and sometimes I regret taking it, but at least I will leave freshman year with an extensive understanding of the atmosphere. Lastly, I took Law, Politics, and Public Policy because I wanted to give pre-law a try since both my parents are lawyers. I am glad I gave it a try because I realized I do not want to be a lawyer and politics are not for me. 
Yes, I am not particularly interested in the majority of the classes I am currently taking; however, I am glad that by the end of my freshman year I will never have to take another language, science, or math class. I also learned it is important to take classes you GENUINELY like, not classes that are later in the day or ensure that you will not have classes on Friday.
So if I have any advice for incoming undecided freshman it would be this: take the GE’s you dislike the most in your first semester and take classes in each category that excite you and you will be easy to understand. Make sure you take classes you like because you only have this opportunity once! 
Focus on whatever fascinates you.  Heeding that advice will make your college years more enjoyable and beneficial.  (I wish that someone had given me that advice and that I had possessed the brains and the self-confidence necessary to follow it.)

Syaru Shirley Lin, a professor of global political economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong and professor of political science at University of Virginia, spoke about cross-strait economic and political relations between China and Taiwan at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Thursday.
Ziru Ling | Daily Trojan
Prior to her teaching years, Lin was an investment banker in Hong Kong.
The USC US-China Institute hosted the talk by Lin to introduce her book Taiwan’s China Dilemma: Contested Identities and Multiple Interests in Taiwan’s Cross-Strait Economic Policy. Lin used this opportunity to explore different ideas she presents in her book including Taiwan’s national identity and how Taiwan’s China policy has been oscillating and moderating over time since former Taiwan President Lee Tung-hui.
Lin revealed to her audience that the title of her book was changed during the last stage of her writing. She came up with the final title to her book from realizing China’s considerable influence and ties among many countries.
“Every country has their own China dilemma,” Lin said.
During the talk, Lin explored the history of Taiwan’s economic situation and how Taiwanese identity has valued international recognition and environmental sustainability.
Despite the increase in trade in Taiwan since President Ma Ying-jeou’s term in Taiwan, Lin acknowledged that the benefits have been inconsistent in the last 10 years.
“Everyone understands that the most important relation between China and Taiwan is not trade, but investment … In Taiwan’s case, it’s based on foreign investment,” Lin said during the presentation.
Lin used several graphs to point out Taiwan’s economic benefit from the 1980s to present day. She tied the slow growth to the complication of doing business with China, a neighbor that is competent of absorbing Taiwan.
“To the Taiwanese, China is both a threat and an opportunity,” Lin said.
Summarizing her talk about Taiwan’s current economic problems, Lin mentioned that Taiwan’s economic problems are blamed on China rather than globalization.
Lin explained that even with the new trade policies with China, the Taiwanese are irrational and inconsistent in their attitudes toward China. While this domestic debate continues to take place in Taiwan, China’s GDP continues to grow.
Continuing to talk about trade, Lin mentioned her disbelief of how the policies adopted by each president since Taiwan rose from martial law years ago has been different.
“Looking at the politics of trade, winners and losers, it’s a mystery to me why in 1996 Lee Tung-hui would restrict investing in China and why Chen would want to liberalize policy towards China,” Lin said. “It didn’t add up to the data on hand.”
Lin noted thought that Taiwanese national identity has strengthened since Tung-hui. Taiwanese identity was initially polarized along ethnic lines: waishenren vs ‘benshenren.’
With democratization in Taiwan in the recent decade, the differences have decreased.
“Taiwanese identity like many other emerging communities were focused on ethical lines,” Lin said. “Over 52% of Taiwanese believed they were only ‘Chinese’ in 1989 … 30 years is a really short period of time, and no one in Taiwan could tell you this is what we would see today,” Lin said.
This polarized identity has mainly caused changes in Taiwan’s China policy. Lin explained that Taiwanese identity consolidated and increasingly embodied a Taiwanese way of life, embracing values such as democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech, press and assembly.
Ending her talk, Lin analyzed the challenges facing Taiwan’s recently elected president, Tsai Ing-wen. Lin anticipated that Tsai must continue managing cross-strait relations while creating domestic support and consensus.
Lin mentioned that Taiwan is currently facing its own big problems outside of China.
Like with Hong Kong, Taiwan is currently falling into what is called the “High Income Trap.”
“Taiwan is experiencing high unemployment rate amongst Taiwanese youth, stagnant real wages and rising property values. The high interest rate environment does not help … it has led to high housing price,” Lin said.
While Taiwan has been increasingly polar on agreeing on its national identity and solving its China dilemma, Lin notably points out that China’s focus right now isn’t necessarily only on Taiwan.
“China is focusing on its own China dilemma,” Lin said.

This year’s IndieCade Festival, the largest event in the United States dedicated to showcasing independent games, will be coming to USC for the first time this weekend.
Photo courtesy of IndieCadeGame on · Participants at last year’s IndieCade Festival explored games of all kinds, from digital to tabletop. All the games at the festival are produced independently, outside of the traditional marketplace.
The festival will start on Friday, continue until Saturday and take place at the School of Cinematic Arts. Attendees will be able to explore newly developed games being showcased by their creators, participate in summits and workshops to exchange ideas and hear about trends in the industry from keynote speakers.
The IndieCade Festival is free to USC students with their student ID.
“Like Sundance, it is a festival, and we’re showing all sorts of games, including traditional digital games, virtual reality, competitive play like eSports, mobile games, physical games and tabletop games. We have it all,” said Stephanie Barish, CEO of IndieCade.
Independent games are made outside of the traditional marketplace, meaning that they may have received alternative forms of funding or are created without access to a game studio. The games themselves may be very different from many of today’s popular games.
The primary purpose of the IndieCade Festival is to bring the independent game community together and foster an atmosphere of collaboration and support. While there, developers can exchange ideas with each other, receive feedback on their games or cultivate new skills.
“There are workshops and events that are focused on skill learning and helping independent developers empower themselves,” said Samuel Roberts, program manager of SCA’s Graduate Interactive Media & Games division and the director of the festival. “One of the workshops focuses on [how designers can address] business and legal issues, and how to run a small company, which is what you have to do as a small independent developer.”
The festival was held in Culver City for the last seven years, but IndieCade chose USC as its new location to avoid construction at their previous site and utilize a larger space to accommodate more participants.
“There’s something here for everyone, and those things are new and exciting and different,” Roberts said. “If you’re not interested in games per se, but cool stories, or interesting experiences, or the future of media … then this is an amazing place to come and see the creative work people are doing.”
Many games that have been showcased at the festival in previous years have become commercially successful. Major gaming companies attend the festival and sometimes offer to continue developing the game or provide funding.
“Oftentimes the games you see at IndieCade are the games you will eventually see on these other platforms [published by large game companies], so you get to see them first,” Roberts said.
Barish said that each year, around 5,000 people attend the IndieCade Festival, with over 200 developers showcasing their work.
“We put a lot of effort into helping the community ‘level-up’ together,” Barish said. “We run lots of events at different sessions that are targeted to our different audiences. We have workshops for developers, for people who are new and interested in breaking in and opportunities for discussion.”
Keenan Mosimann, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment, is one of the developers who will be showcasing his game at the festival this year.
Mosimann’s game, called ICU, is a horror game where the player must overcome audience-imposed obstacles to complete each level. People watch the game take place online in real time and vote on ways to make the game more fun and challenging for the player.
Mosimann started working on the game a year and a half ago in one of his classes, eventually getting it approved for his senior thesis project. Now he has several people helping him design the game and has received funding to further develop it through Kickstarter campaigns and pitches to investors.
“Everyone loves games. Be it board games, video games or football, this is all under the umbrella of IndieCade. It’s not a trade festival or a niche audience,” Mosimann said. “If you’re just looking for a fun thing to do on the weekend, regardless of whether you want to break into games yourself, coming to IndieCade you will find a fun activity to do for a couple days, and you’ll get to meet game developers.”
For Mosimann, it is a place for enthusiastic and casual gamers alike.
“If you’re there to see passionate people doing what they love, or if you’re there to play some fun games, IndieCade Festival has something for everyone,” Mosimann said.
