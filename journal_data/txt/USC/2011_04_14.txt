For a team that has faced three ranked teams in three consecutive weekends, hosting an unranked opponent might sound like a welcome respite. But the USC baseball team isn’t counting on any breaks this weekend when it hosts Oregon in a three-game series at Dedeaux Field.
Finding a groove · After a strong start against Stanford, junior pitcher Andrew Triggs aims to give USC another solid performance on the hill. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
“Oregon can play,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “They’ve been having a bit of a disappointing season, so we expect them to come out strong.”
It hasn’t quite been the season the Ducks (16-14, 1-5) were hoping for.
In just its third year as a Division-I program, Oregon entered the season ranked No. 14 in the country. The Ducks went 15-9 in nonconference play, but Pac-10 play has not been so kind to them.
They were swept by then-No. 5 Arizona State to start conference play, then dropped their first two games last weekend to Washington (10-20, 2-4). Oregon is currently mired in a five-game losing streak, during which it has scored only six runs.
“We know better than to take [Oregon] lightly,” Cruz said. “They can pitch right up there with anyone.”
The stage is certainly set for some old-fashioned pitchers duels this weekend, as it is the Ducks pitching that defines them.
Tonight’s starter, Tyler Anderson, is rated the No. 22 prospect in the country by Baseball America. The junior lefty is 4-1 with a 1.70 ERA in eight starts this year. Opponents are hitting just .193 against him, but perhaps most impressively, he has struck out 65 hitters in 85 and one-third innings while walking just 19.
It won’t get any easier for the Trojans (13-9, 4-5) on Saturday. Oregon starter Madison Boer has a 1.87 ERA, and an opponent’s batting average of just .199. Sunday’s starter Alex Keudell has an ERA of 3.00 and an opponent’s batting average of .230.
The Ducks pitching staff has an ERA of 2.83. They average more than one strikeout per inning and opponents are hitting just .225 against them.
“It should be fun,” said junior pitcher Andrew Triggs. “Both staffs are coming off some pretty decent weekends, and it’s always more fun to pitch in close games.”
Triggs went seven solid innings a week ago against Stanford, and the junior seems to be finding his rhythm.
He was shown up, however, by junior Austin Wood on Saturday and senior Logan Odom on Sunday.
Wood went eight-plus against the Cardinal, allowing just one unearned run while striking out eight in a dominating performance. Odom followed that up the next day with seven shutout innings, also fanning eight Stanford hitters.
Odom has been the Trojans’ best pitcher this year with an ERA of 3.06 and an opponent’s average of .202. The team will look to him as an anchor Sunday.
“He’s been like a rock this year,” Cruz said. “But seriously, he’s led by example. He’s been our most dependable pitcher and even when he’s not pitching, he’s still very involved in the game, helping people out.”
As is often the case in games featuring great pitchers, getting a lead early will be crucial, especially given the Trojans’ history. The Trojans are 10-4 when scoring first this season, and just 3-15 when conceding the first run.
“We battle back well,” Cruz said. “But obviously it’s easier if we just hop out in front.”
Tonight’s game begins at 6 p.m.

Think back to when you were a kid, when you would come home from school and shoot hoops with your friends in your driveway, or wake up on a rainy Saturday morning and put on your soccer jersey and cleats on without a second thought, or when you would spend all day in your fourth grade class trying to contain your excitement as you thought about the Little League game you were going to play under the lights that night, just like the big leaguers.
Why did you do all of these things? You didn’t do them because your parents made you. You didn’t do them because your religion said so.
You did them because they were fun. You wanted to go out and, as Michael Jordan, beat the Lakers in your backyard (at least I did). You wanted to get out and make that game-saving diving catch in center field because you liked how it felt.
But as you grew older, fun seemed to become less and less important — sports became more of an obsession, or just becomes routine.
By the time you get to the collegiate level, almost everyone is serious, growling, trash talking and cursing — not smiling, laughing and having fun.
Perhaps that’s why it seemed strange to me when, after practice yesterday, I saw junior quarterback Matt Barkley and junior safety T.J. McDonald walking away from the baseball field, where they had gone immediately after practice, shoulder pads in hand, smiling and laughing.
I asked McDonald why some of the football players had been taking batting practice. Was it to enhance hand-eye coordination? Was it to strengthen and quicken their upper bodies?
No.
“It was just for fun,” McDonald said.
That’s when it hit me. Other members of the media and I attend football practice so often, analyzing everything that goes on, that we have become brainwashed into thinking about everything from a critical perspective. If the players are doing something, it must be to focus on a skill. Or if they aren’t running until they get sick, something must be wrong.
But then I thought about it, and I actually felt ashamed I had thought batting practice was another drill for the safety and quarterback to do. Nope ­— they were just having fun.
Ultimately, what’s the point of playing without a sense of enjoyment?
I remember the first time I asked myself this. It was at tryouts for the sophomore basketball team in high school. I had played basketball since kindergarten and loved the sport.
I was looking forward to tryouts the way a kindergartner looks forward to his birthday. But during the first few days, the fun just got sucked out of the game. I don’t know what happened, but I found myself dreading going to tryouts, something I could barely comprehend. I knew there was no point in continuing, so I quit tryouts there on the spot. Why continue with something I clearly was not enjoying?
That’s something I think we all could learn from. Like the football players taking batting practice, we need to do things every day simply because they are fun, and it starts with putting the enjoyment back in sports.

USC coach Lane Kiffin described Thursday’s practice as “uneventful,” but apparently sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods didn’t get the memo.
Dynamic duo · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley has found a new favorite target in sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods this spring. - Stephanie Guo | Daily Trojan 
Woods punctuated a fine day on the field with an acrobatic leaping catch in the back corner of the end zone on a perfectly thrown fade pass by junior quarterback Matt Barkley. The Pac-10 Offensive Freshman of the Year made plays all over the field, and involved in almost every offensive play.
“Two guys that shined on offense were Barkley and Woods,” Kiffin said. “They had great days, nothing new on that.”
Throughout the spring, Woods has remained Barkley’s favorite receiver, and if the spring is any indication, his hard work is indeed paying off.
For more evidence, look no farther than Saturday’s scrimmage, where Barkley and Woods looked in sync all day, hooking up 10 times for 65 yards.
Although Woods’ big-play ability was a hallmark of his freshman season, he has put in the time and effort trying to hone his all-around game.
Questions about who will get  the backup quarterback spot are slowly being answered by redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins.
“Jesse Scroggins had another good day, continues to develop and it’s exciting to see,” Kiffin said. “[He’s] improved everything: his accuracy, decision-making and command of the huddle. He still has a long way to go with the huddle, like any freshman would, but he’s made a lot of strides.”
Scroggins is battling fellow freshman quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek for the No. 2 spot behind Barkley on the depth chart.
The USC receiving corps continues to be plagued by dropped passes. The number of drops has been rising, across the entire receiving corp.
The USC offense is reliant on solid all-around receiver play, especially with the defenses expected to key on Woods after his breakout year last fall.
Sophomore tight end Christian Thomas came down with an apparent foot injury Thursday and was sent to the locker room for x-rays, but they came back negative.
With all of the injuries at linebacker, new blood was required to fill in and one person specifically caught the attention of Kiffin.
“The guy that has jumped out has been Hayes Pullard,” Kiffin mentioned. “He’s doing really well, and it’s good to see since he was banged up last year. He really didn’t show us much last year, but he had a good offseason and he looks really good out there.”
Although the coaching staff was pleased with Pullard’s play, USC has yet to find somebody to fill in for an inexperienced offensive line.
USC coach James Cregg is trying to replace three starters, including potential top-10 pick Tyron Smith.
The depth of the Trojans has been a strength in previous seasons, but has been hard-pressed because of injuries and sanctions.
 
 
 
 
Laughed out loud when I read the headline. USC Alums all over the world agree, Matt Barkley is a stellar offense in so many ways, most especially to the American value of Equality and USC value of integrity.

Junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick might not get the same attention as his teammates, but his solid play in USC’s victories has propelled the Trojans to one of their best records in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
Leading the pack · Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli proved instrumental in USC’s straight-set victory over UCLA at Galen Center on Thursday night with a game-high 16 kills. The Trojans will face their rival Bruins in next week’s conference tournament. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Such was the case yet again on Thursday.
The 6-foot-7 junior registered five kills, one ace and two blocks to help the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team  (20-2, 18-2) rout No. 8 UCLA (25-12, 25-22, 25-21), as the Trojans bested their crosstown rivals in every statistical category, including hitting percentage, aces, digs and blocks.
“That was a great win,” Shandrick said. “Obviously, in the crosstown rivalry, records don’t really matter as much. That said, we made a lot of errors in the second set, and we can’t do that again Saturday night. There are always things to work on.”
Senior opposite Murphy Troy and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli led the team in kills, finishing with 16 and 12 kills, respectively.
In fact, Ciarelli and Troy exasperated UCLA coach Al Scates so much in the first set that he decided to sit two of his struggling core players, juniors quick hitter Weston Dunlap and opposite Kyle Caldwell, for almost the entire match. Dunlap, who is second on the UCLA team with 259 kills on the season at an impressive .461 efficiency rate, managed zero kills at a paltry -.286 clip before bowing out after the first set.
“Scates usually moves guys in and out of the lineup based on match-ups, but that was a little surprising,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “When we face them again next week, I expect him to stick with a more consistent lineup.”
There was a rather odd dynamic to this game, as the Trojans will face UCLA next week in the opening round of the MPSF playoffs. USC, however, was pleased with the statement it made.
At the end of the third set, Ciarelli emphatically sealed the victory with a cross-court kill after a UCLA player attempted to rope him into some competitive banter.
With so much at stake for the Trojans this season, Ciarelli refused to enter the fray.
“My number one reaction is that it is always great to beat UCLA,” Ciarelli said. “We always get fired up for these rivalry games, and there is no doubt that that type of energy always works to our advantage.”
USC closes out its regular season at home tomorrow at 7 p.m. against No. 6 UC Santa Barbara.
The Trojans upended the Gauchos in straight sets, 25-20, 25-22, 25-22 earlier this season.

Los Angeles is a city known for its diversity and vibrant neighborhoods, a fact USC alum Jeff Okita took advantage of in August 2009 to start a company, Six Taste Food Tours. Okita, who graduated from USC in spring 2008 with a degree in English and a minor in business administration, spoke with the Daily Trojan in a phone interview about his startup and his time at USC.
 
Daily Trojan: What does Six Taste Food Tours do?
Jeff Okita: We provide four-hour tours in different communities of Los Angeles, where people learn about the culture and history of the area and also are able to sample several dishes from local restaurants. It’s a way for people to connect to different communities through an accessible medium, which is food.
 
DT: What made you decide to start the company?
Okita: I really wanted something of my own, to be my own boss and to be able to innovate. I wanted to take advantage of the fact that Los Angeles has one of the most interesting culinary experiences with several distinct, segmented communities. I wanted to give people the chance to explore these communities and the food that they have to offer.
 
DT: What was your favorite class at USC and why?
Okita: MDA 365: The Art and Adventure of Leadership, which was taught by President Steven B. Sample and Dr. Warren Bennis. It was filled with amazing guest speakers and dealt with leadership in a way that I had never really thought about before. It was also very challenging and engaging to be able to hear from President Sample and Dr. Bennis.
 
DT: What was your favorite experience at USC outside of your classes?
Okita: I would have to say founding Delta Omicron Zeta, the leadership fraternity on campus. We had to create a foundation for this fraternity in one semester, and looking at it today and seeing how it’s grown into an 80-person fraternity based on our core values that we established at the beginning is truly amazing.
 
DT: How did your time at USC help you in your career now?
Okita: More than any of the classes, what helped me in the real world were the interactions I had in student organizations and such. Being in a college environment allows you to understand different experiences and perspectives, which is really valuable in the real world and in becoming an effective leader.
 
DT: What advice would you like to give to current Trojans?
Okita: I would encourage people to really take advantage of the Trojan network. It’s very real, you can easily ask a Trojan alum for help and they will go out of their way to help you. It’s amazing what people will do for you if you’re a fellow Trojan, and a lot of people should take greater advantage of the fact that you really are a part of this strong Trojan family.

A family that owns a summer home might have better access to college than a family that earns a combined six-figure income, according to a study released last weekend at the American Educational Association’s annual meeting in New Orleans.
The study, titled “The Differential Impact of Wealth vs. Income in the College-Going Process,” was written by Su Jin Jez, an assistant professor of public policy and administration at California State University Sacramento, and reveals wealth to be the most important predictor of college access.
Wealth is defined as the accumulation of a family’s income and assets, such as homes and investments.
“Wealth and income affect the college choice process differently, with wealth consistently being more significant in predicting the college-choice outcomes,” Jez writes in her study.  “The impact of wealth persists even after controlling for academic achievement, habitus, social capital and cultural capital.”
The study reports that of the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans, 25 percent have obtained a bachelors degree, while only 16 percent of the top 10 percent of income earners hold a bachelors degree. Nine percent of the entire population has a bachelors degree.
The process leading up to a student’s final college decision is two-pronged, according to Tom McWhorter, executive director of financial aid at USC. First, educational preparation and culture, among other factors, define which universities applicants have access to. Secondly, financial resources often dictate what universities students apply to and ultimately attend.
“After access, which includes educational background, comes choice, which is what makes the most sense for a student, where cost is the most important factor,” McWhorter said.
USC recognizes wealth prevents many students from gaining access to the university, and has therefore developed a comprehensive method for evaluating the amount of need-based financial aid students receive.
Many universities assess a family’s income, some assets and allowance for living and retirement expenses, when allocating financial aid resources. This information is submitted as part of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
USC, however, also requires financial aid applicants to submit a College Scholarship Services form, which discloses assets and other expenses not accounted for in the federal calculation.
“To distribute funds for need-based grants in the fairest way possible, we will consider all income and assets that may not be considered in the federal calculation,” McWhorter said. “We may ask a family to contribute more of their resources because of their comparative financial strength, which may not come from income alone.”
USC’s methodology of distributing need-based financial aid based on the total wealth should guide other universities to make college more accesible to all Americans, according to Jez’s study.
“Policy makers looking to level the playing field and make college more accessible to all American’s must address wealth’s impact on the college-going process, instead of merely focusing on issues of income,” Jez writes.
Some schools like the University of Chicago and Yale University participate in CSS, but other schools, such as UCLA, do not.
The study goes on to report that only 2 percent of the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans have not completed high school or earned their GED, however, approximately 8 percent of the top 10 percent of income earners have not graduated from high school or earned their GED.
Of the 10 percent of young Americans with the least family wealth, 34 percent have not completed high school or earned a GED, while 26 percent of the bottom 10 percent of income earners have not graduated from high school or earned a GED.

USC’s freshman admission rate hit an all-time low this year, as only 22.7 percent of the record-setting 37,200 applicants were accepted.
Dean of Admission Tim Brunold said the university saw about a 4-percent increase in applications from 2010. Of this year’s applicants, only 8,450 freshmen were offered admission, lowering the admission rate from 24.3 percent to 22.7 percent.
Visitors · Hugh Garvey, a sophomore majoring in business administration, gives a tour to potential USC students and their families. USC accepted about 8,400 students this year. - Betsy Newman | Daily Trojan 
“More students means more competition and more selectivity,” Brunold said. “We are not trying to grow the size of the freshman class, so increases in applications result in more competition for a small number of spaces.”
Michael Moreno, an incoming freshman, said it has been his dream to attend USC.
“I am very excited to become apart of this community of talented and intelligent young people,” Moreno said. “I could not ask for a better university to go to, this has been my dream school for so long and I can’t wait to start learning and living as a Trojan.”
The majority of the applicants were well-qualified Brunold said, so each application has to be thoroughly evaluated.
“Increased selectivity puts more importance on the qualitative components of an application,” Brunold said. “We can only make around 8,400 admission offers, but 25,000 or more of our applicants would clearly, judging by GPA and standardized tests, be able to succeed in the classroom at USC. This increased selectivity results in more staff time being spent reading, evaluating and discussing applications.”
Brunold said USC will continue to become more selective as the number of students who apply to the university increases.
“It’s safe to assume that we will only become more selective in the future,” Brunold said. “Five years ago, our freshman admission rate was 25.4 percent; 10 years ago, it was 32.1 percent.”
USC’s freshman yield, the percentage of accepted freshmen who actually enroll, is typically between 32 percent and 35 percent of those offered admission, according to Brunold. If those numbers hold, USC is expected to enroll approximately 2,650 freshmen this upcoming school year.
Students of the incoming freshman class are already excited to begin their fall semester at USC.
“Everyone has had wonderful things to say about USC, and I can’t wait to be part of the Trojan family,” said Kaitlyn Couture, an incoming freshman. “I am so excited to play on the new women’s lacrosse team, watch sports games and meet new people.”
USC was recently ranked No. 23 nationally by US News & World Report. Brunold, however, said students are more attracted to USC as a whole, not simply because of a ranking.
“Many prospective students and families use rankings in their college search, but the increase in applications has been much more directly correlated to our increased and improved recruitment and outreach,” he said.
Some students said the campus atmosphere lured them to USC.
“At first, I actually wasn’t really looking at USC because I had wanted to go to a college that would be farther away from home,” said Emily Huang, an incoming freshman. “But after visiting and experiencing the sense of community, I fell in love with USC.”
Though USC has made national news in recent weeks with several scandals, the university is not concerned these recent events will interfere with students’ decisions to choose to attend USC.
“It’s logical to assume that negative press can have a chilling effect, however, we have not experienced any backlash or concerns,” Brunold said. “I have personally been out on the road a great deal lately and no one has asked about these issues.”
There’s no doubt in my mind that CommonApp will lower the rate significantly. On the other hand, there’s another perhaps equally important factor: the enrollment rate. With USC’s reputation and strength, the enrollment rate can go way higher. If the rate doubles (which is about average for some similar schools), the admission rate for the following year will go down to half of the current year.
While we went down from 24.3 last year to 22.7 this year, UCLA’s admission rate (overall) went up from 22.7 last year to 25.3 this year.
What’s more? While USC’s admit rate of 22.7 is true for applicants across the country, UCLA is more competitive among instate applicants. This year, among California applicants, UCLA also had an admit rate of 22.7. So, I believe that now we can for sure say that USC is more difficult to get into than UCLA (even with their excuse that it is more difficult for in-state applicants).
Fight On!

*They are both two great schools, and it is wonderful that L.A. now has two highly prestigious Universities within its city limits. This is all said in the spirit of our crosstown rivalry.
Good job SC! I remember the days, prior to former President Sample’s watch, when SC was considered the school that served as an NFL expedient, but not academics. Well, things have certainly changed. Oh yeah, the cinema program was hard to get into as well back then, but not everyone becomes a Steven Spielberg…oh wait, didn’t get rejected by SC’s cinema school? That’s right, he made the dean write 100x “you are accepted, you are accepted….” after SC apologized for rebuffing his admission request.
I have no idea why USC is against using the CommonApp.
Kappa Sig takes 100%
I am sure the acceptance rate will drop even further once USC uses the common application.
yeah yeah yeah go sc!!!!!

The number of band breakups, hiatuses and reunions that have been announced lately is dizzying.
It’s tough to sift through the number of bands that say they are ready to display the glory of their yesteryears or  to present a new sound and forget who’s back for real.
But whether you’re an alternative fan or not, one album you should not overlook in this whirlwind of change is Blood Pressures, an alluring, gritty album from The Kills, made up of VV, aka Alison Mosshart, and Hotel, aka Jamie Hince.
Despite a brief hiatus, the duo is as strong as ever. Mosshart’s previous involvement in the band The Dead Weather, which included Jack White, did not take away from her importance in The Kills, nor did it diminish the authentic spirit of the band.
Sass-ridden and fuzzy-chord-loving, Blood Pressures stays true to the Mosshart-Hince dynamic music fans are used to.
From start to end, Blood Pressures keeps to this style, showcasing the duo’s riveting instrumental rhythms and Mosshart’s distinctively rich voice.
The harmonies on the album continue to engage while hailing back to sounds from 2008’s Midnight Boom. There is a confidence and originality that makes each track ooze with a stage presence and up-front personality rarely captured anywhere but on a live set.
“Nail in My Coffin” starts off with edgy guitar chords and a biting drum beat. Soon, Mosshart’s voice cuts and steals the spotlight, both with its vocal gymnastics and with Mosshart’s saucy attitude.
The repetition of a nail in my coffin / and I don’t need another one, creates a catchy melody that weaves itself into the gritty guitar chords exploding in the background. Sure, the phrase is cliché, but Mosshart’s bold voice elevates this song to Kills greatness.
In an interview with Spin magazine, Hince admitted he felt Mosshart’s confidence was boosted from her time with The Dead Weather, during which she sang lead vocals over loud instrumentals.
That change is obvious, but there is also a newfound focus on Hince’s vocals. He even gets an entire track to himself — the markedly more mellow, short and dreamlike “Wild Charms.”
Sounding like something he would sing to his sweetheart, supermodel Kate Moss, the track feels a little jarring in the middle of the album.
But with the rough sounds of the entire album, the track‘s softer sound is like a soothing breath of cool air amidst the harsher sounds of the rest of the album.
Similarly, “The Last Goodbye” weakens the tempo. The track is not nearly as engaging as the others, and lines like How can I rely on my heart if I break it / with my own two hands, are robbed of their sentimentality by gratingly cheesy violin-esque sounds in the background.
But these two tracks are the only slip-ups in the album. The rest carries on the thrilling energy The Kills are so good at crafting.
The duo tops off the album with the bluesy “Pots and Pans,” a song that starts off with some clever lines about kitchen appliances and keeping a certain someone “cooking.” The perfect ending to a raucously enjoyable album, the song ends with the fitting line these are the days we’ll never forget / when the dawn dawns on you.
Side projects and supermodel girlfriends aside, Blood Pressures is a sure sign The Kills are back, and not only for the sake of making money from their reunion.
They are back to continue what they started.

For geeks, this summer is one of excitement and anticipation.
With the iPad 2 already out, the year’s tech craze is in full swing. And, starting in May, a four-month wave of new books, movies and television shows coming out is sure to make us happy.
One excited geek is Matt Campagna, the host of the popular video podcasts Your Geek News and BSGCast. Campagna is a film director, television producer, screenwriter and self-proclaimed nerd.
“Oh, I’ve been a geek since building my first 3D glow-in-the-dark dinosaur skeleton puzzles watching black and white Doctor Who episodes in Mississauga Ontario in the early ’80s,” Campagna said. “It’s in my DNA. From Time Lords and Hobbits to dinosaurs and robots, I’ve loved all things nerdy for as long as I can remember.”
One of Campagna’s passions is the Western genre, and he used that to make his first feature film, 2008’s Six Reasons Why, with his brother Jeff.
But making a straight Western presented some problems.
“A lot of storytellers like me enjoy the charm and character of classics like Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns, but we’ve learned the lessons of 3:10 to Yuma and The Proposition — you can make a great western and nobody will see it,” he said.
So Campagna turned to a genre mashup. By putting together the Western with elements of a post-apocalyptic film like Mad Max, he found a new way to tell the story.
This kind of genre combination is on the rise, from comics like the entertaining Cowboy Ninja Viking to films like Zack Snyder’s disappointing but strangely enthralling Sucker Punch.
“If you make a Western sci-fi like Serenity, or a revisionist history Macaroni Combat like Inglourious Basterds, and hopefully a mash-up cowboy and alien movie, you’ll get enough of a draw to your Western story that you can make a go of it at the box office,” Campagna said. “It’s really nothing new, James Cameron knows the trick. Terminator 2 is a Western if you think about it.”
Along with his filmmaking, Campagna is the co-founder of Mississauga Independent Film Festival, an event aimed at promoting local films made without big studio production. He said the do-it-yourself mentality of Mississauga filmmakers is one of the things he loves most about geek culture, as people are taking things into their own hands to bring their visions to life.
“We’re the generation of chemistry-set and radio-kit geeks. We love working with our hands, but we’ve got some serious brainpower to back it up,” he said. “And short of a DIY moon landing, making a film is one of the craziest undertakings a geek can try. There are so many disparate skills and impossible odds that it’s just about impossible. But not quite. And we just love that kind of challenge,” Campagna said.
This DIY mindset is aided, Campagna said, by the accessibility of technology.
“We have used the one-stop non-linear-edit-suite of a $1000 MacBook instead of the $250,000 Avid that used to be the industry standard for decades. That’s empowering,” Campagna said.
But still he  jokes about technology addiction — even his own.
“But how much time do we spend Facebooking or texting while we try to cross the street?” Campagna asked. “Probably too much.”
As a geek himself, Campagna sees geek culture growing.
Everyone is a geek, in his opinion, even if their interests aren’t traditionally geeky things.
“There are food geeks, sci-fi geeks, baseball geeks, fantasy geeks,” Campagna said.  “They can all read caloric, warp, RBI and Silmarillion stats from memory,” “They’re just geeks of a different flavor. We’ve always been geeks, really, but now we’ll know which geek team we’re playing for.”
And for those who don’t admit their geek status, Campagna says things like summer movies, especially superhero ones, slowly get even the most mainstream of people into nerdy fields.
As a critic and a fan, he already has picked out the one he’s most excited for.
“X-Men: First Class looks like the biggest winner to me,” he said. “McAvoy and Fassbender are both phenomenal, and with the supporting cast of gifted youngsters plus Kevin Bacon and a cameo from Hugh Jackman? And a period piece on top of it all? That baby’s going to sing.”
Rising stars, big action set pieces and the man who ties Hollywood together? In Campagna’s eyes, that will draw in a big crowd, geek and non-geek alike.

What is it about public transportation that curdles the blood of so many Angelenos? The Tangerine Dream-era seat fabric? The way a bus will often roar through a busy intersection like a rhinoceros? That creeping dread that maybe the last occupant of your seat was recently diagnosed with the Ebola virus?
The car culture of Los Angeles has reigned for decades, but as oil prices skyrocket and green energy laws are drafted, the winds of change are slowly moving toward our fair city.
For those wedded to their steel on wheels but desperate to have some extra cash in their wallets, there are two options: resist, or take a walk on the wild side and learn how to properly navigate and exploit Los Angeles’ vast bus and subway network.
For all you metropolitan greenhorns, here are six easy routes to begin with, spanning the Pacific Coast to the fertile hills of Pasadena, at only a few dollars per trip.
 
The 754 Bus
If you’re looking to grab a gourmet burger or a Colin Firth picture in Los Feliz or Silverlake districts, there’s no faster way to get there than on the Rapid 754 bus line.
Running every 15 minutes from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week, students can catch the bus at its two closest stops: Vermont Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard, and Vermont and Adams Boulevard.
The 754 shoots straight up Vermont like an arrow, finishing at Vermont and Hollywood Boulevard, a mere five minutes from Umami Burger, the Alcove Bakery and countless vintage clothing purveyors.
The Red Line
Whether you’re rushing to Arclight Hollywood for the premiere of The Tree of Life, returning an oversized shirt to H&M or catching a bus to Palm Springs, the Red Line subway is your ticket to easy travel.
Easily accessible by the DASH and running from Union Station to North Hollywood, the Red Line passes within walking distance of Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and even Downtown’s growing art and beer districts.
It runs until 1 a.m. most nights, is always well-populated and generally attracts at least one Charlie Sheen hopeful per trip.
Bring a book or a magazine and you’ll have no problems.
The 20 Bus
A serious granddaddy of buses, the 20 treks has from Downtown Los Angeles to the salty ambiance of Santa Monica Pier, traveling solely on Wilshire Boulevard (a quick trip away via the 754.)
The commute to the coast can take up to an hour, depending on traffic, but the 20 remains a convenient means of getting your barnacle fix each weekend.
In addition, it runs 24 hours a day, which means you can top off an afternoon on 3rd Street Promenade with a show at The El Rey or The Wiltern on your way back. Expensive margaritas and Explosions in the Sky in one day? Sold!
 
The Gold Line
Departing from Union Station, the Gold Line operates during the same hours as the Red Line, but attracts a notably more handsome crowd.
This is probably because the Gold Line burrows deep into the Northern knolls of Pasadena, with stations near the ritziest of neighborhoods.
If it’s the sprawl of Colorado Boulevard you seek, hop off at the Lake station and walk five minutes south on North Lake Avenue.
Before you know it, you’ll have a Target, a Laemmle movie theater and countless Italian restaurants at your disposal. The beautiful Huntington gallery is also just a 15-minute walk away.
 
The 33 Bus
It’s 2 a.m., you’re stumbling from a night of Pabst Blue Ribbon at The Standard and the only thing you want is the comfort of your own bed and the zing of a Tacos Perez burrito. No problem. Just hop on the hourly 33 bus from 7th and Spring Streets, and you’ll be back at Ellendale and Adams in 20 minutes. Running 24 hours a day, the 33 seems designed for late night extractions from Downtown.
 
Awesome tips! :) With a leg on each side of the comforting seashore to the abundant hills of Pasadena, at only a few dollars per excursion; Thanks!
Finally a great article on public transportation! A lot of college students are too afraid of using public transportation (and I daresay a handful of students think they’re too good for it) but public transportation many times can be a lot more convenient than driving. And forget the naysayers, LA public transportation has really improved, especially in the metropolitan downtown area. The 754 is a staple in my life, as is the 204. The Red Line is also great, and they even have events such as the “No Pants Metro Day” (although unaffiliated with Metro). Hopefully this article will deter some non-believers and people will actually start using public transportation in LA.
ah, this brings back memories of a 4am-6am trip on the 754 to the 720 to the beach after a great night of partying. watching the sun rise over the city while strolling along the pier was a beauty i have not seen since.

In the last two weeks, we have seen one of the most positive developments to emerge from Washington, D.C. in a long time: Both Republicans and Democrats have released proposals for meaningful, long-term budget reform to get the federal government’s debt under control.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Each side has released its own partisan agenda, but combining the best ideas from both will ultimately best serve the interests of our country in the crucial years ahead.
In their willingness to at least address the government’s largest and fastest-growing costs, both parties’ plans promise to finally move the debate beyond the haggling over relatively insignificant amounts of discretionary spending that has dominated Capitol Hill for the last few months. It was obvious in the context of a deficit projected to reach $1.5 trillion this year that the difference between the Democrats’ desired $40 billion in spending cuts in the 2011 budget and the Republicans’ proposed $80 billion was barely worthy of debate.
The Republican plan, released last week by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), and the Democrats’, announced by President Barack Obama on Wednesday, represent the first time policy makers have moved beyond twiddling their thumbs on the most important domestic policy question of our time.
The plans, unsurprisingly, are starkly different from each other.
Ryan’s plan, titled “The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise,” aims to cut $5.8 trillion in federal spending in the next 10 years.
Ryan proposes turning Medicare into a voucher program, whereby the government would contribute a specific amount of money toward seniors’ health plans.
He wants to shift the responsibility for Medicaid spending to the states and support them with block grants, which he claims would save the federal government $771 billion over the course of a decade.
Ryan also wants to cut $1.6 trillion in domestic discretionary spending by 2022.
Furthermore, in a proposal many are labeling his plan’s Achilles’ heel, Ryan wants to eliminate many tax breaks while also lowering the top marginal tax rate on both individuals and corporations from 35 percent to 25 percent.
Obama’s plan, in contrast, relies on a combination of spending cuts and tax increases to cut the deficit by a total of $4 trillion over 12 years. Aides say the plan would rely on $1 of tax increases for every $3 of savings from spending cuts, which Obama is selling as a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.
The president’s proposals include slowing growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending through a variety of measures, but without overhauling either system. Obama also wants to cut $400 billion from defense spending over the next 12 years and $600 billion from domestic discretionary spending over 10 years.
Obama was strongest on taxes, saying he, like Ryan, would eliminate loopholes — but also that he refuses to extend the Bush tax cuts again.
“There’s nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” he said Wednesday at George Washington University.
Both plans have their strengths and weaknesses. Obama is right that tax raises and defense cuts —  both inconceivable to the right wing —  are unavoidable if the government is to make progress on the deficit.
The Republican’s refusal to even put those topics on the table is a denial of reality, but hopefully Obama’s forceful statements will make these issues a serious topic of conversation.
Obama’s vague proposals for reforming the major entitlement programs, however, are inadequate, which should play into Ryan’s hand nicely.
Ryan’s best suggestion is the transformation of Medicare. A voucher program would continue to support the elderly, while allowing market forces to bring health care costs down.
The rest of Ryan’s plan, however, smacks of partisan pandering.
Shifting Medicaid to the states would mean passing the burden of reform to even less fiscally responsible legislatures facing even more difficult budget problems — not a recipe for success. Meanwhile, cutting taxes for the wealthy as part of a deficit reduction proposal is absurd, and sure to reflect poorly on the rest of Ryan’s program.
Admittedly, even by combining the winning proposals of both sides and filtering out the weak ones, some key issues are left off the table altogether.
Especially disappointing is both parties’ lack of attention to Social Security, indicative of political caution at the beginning of an election cycle, but counterproductive policy-wise.
Still, that there are any proposals on the table, especially this early in the 2012 budget process, must be seen as a great achievement. With months left to negotiate, there is finally some reason for optimism the government might be able to start bringing the deficit down.
If a plan that incorporates each side’s best ideas — including tax raises on the wealthy, Medicare reform and defense cuts — is passed by next year, Ryan might indeed have helped us get back on “the path to prosperity.”

Shouldn’t we first have discretionary income before having discretionary spending? We are borrowing $1,600,000,000,000 to have the Obama level of spending! OOops, subtract $38 billion from that number because of the budget deal.
If the spending for FY 2011 is more than FY 2010 then there is no “CUT”. There was no cut.
Our deficit spending exceeds the typical budget proposed by Bill Clinton during his first four years as president – now that is a big spender!

While the federal government was on the brink of a shut down last week, it was also focusing valuable resources on “defending” Libya.
Never mind the absurdity of the precedent set by bombing Libya, nor the fact that Libya’s population is roughly two-thirds that of the Los Angeles region — an indication of Libya’s relative geopolitical irrelevance.
Some of President Barack Obama’s recent decisions, both at home and abroad, have jeopardized his domestic agenda.
The enforcement of a Libyan no-fly zone has cost taxpayers more than $600 million so far, according to official estimates by the Pentagon, and it has shifted lawmakers’ attention away from more pressing domestic issues — like the budget.
What makes the Libyan misadventure all the more perplexing is Obama knew a government shutdown was an imminent threat when he chose to get involved.
Obama got lucky his misguided decision didn’t face backlash, given the repercussions of a government shutdown.
Consumer confidence would have slumped, the mortgage market would have frozen, investors would have gotten skittish about government debt and the nation’s prestigious AAA credit rating would have taken hits as well. The lingering effects of such market trauma would have been felt for weeks, if not months.
Obama’s handling of the imminent shutdown also seemed out of line with his domestic goals. Every cent of cuts that enabled the one-week continuing resolution that kept crucial government services afloat came from either the Department of Transportation or the Department of Housing and Urban Development at a time when our national infrastructure is crumbling before our eyes. What happened to the whole “Rebuilding America” thing?
Certainly intervention in Libya didn’t cause the budgetary gridlock that had the potential to shut down the government, but focusing on crises overseas, at the expense of addressing problems at home, did nothing to mitigate the problem. That is not the change we need. And it sure isn’t the change I voted for in 2008.

What I can say is, he’s doing a wayyyyyy better job than BUsh ever did. Bush has us in such a mess it will take Obama & the next President to clean it up. 
The number of soildiers wev’e lost is due to this war Bush got us involved in.
