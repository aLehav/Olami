A pedestrian was struck in a hit and run accident on the intersection of W. 23rd Street and Portland Street on Tuesday night. He succumbed to his injuries early Wednesday morning, according to police.
The victim was identified by LAPD Officer Joseph Cha as 58-year-old Elias Aceves, who lived near the site with his elderly mother.  Aceves was crossing northbound at 23rd Street when he was struck by a white sedan headed westbound at approximately 9:10 p.m.. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Officials originally stated that he suffered a fractured femur and a fractured arm, but police later confirmed that the victim died from the injuries.
At 9:53 p.m., the Dept. of Public Safety issued a Trojan Alert that said police activity at 23rd Street and Portland Street was underway. Student eyewitnesses reported a backpack, mug and shoes to be found lying in the street at the intersection. According to the LAPD, the man was thrown 70 feet away following the impact. The victim’s shoes were also found on the scene about 20 feet or two bus lengths away from the crossing.
LAPD is currently investigating the crime using surveillance cameras to identify the driver of the vehicle that struck the victim.
A second Trojan Alert was sent to USC students at 11:17 p.m. stating that police activity in the area was still ongoing.
As of 11:30 p.m., 23rd Street from Oak Street to Portland Street still remained closed as the investigation is still taking place. The area was then cleared just before midnight and open to traffic.
Joseph Chen contributed to this report.

The Environmental Student Assembly announced the Green Engagement Fund on Thursday, a new initiative that aims to fund student-driven projects geared toward increasing sustainability at USC, while increasing awareness in environmental stewardship.
Graduate Student Government, ESA and the USC Sustainability Office have been working to implement the project for a few years. Shawn Rhoads, executive director of ESA and chair of the Green Engagement Fund, said the initiative was a long-term goal for the organization.
“About two years ago, the Graduate Student Government voted to put aside money within their budget to fund green projects,” Rhoads said. “This was a while back, and no further action was really taken. So, what we’ve been working on this year is putting into place the original idea to create the USC Green Engagement Fund.”
ESA decided to team up with GSG because ESA has been limited in the past by the ability to solely distribute funding for event based projects. Students who previously had ideas for campus-based projects were turned away.
Rhoads explained that the projects are expected to be student-driven, but should have at least one faculty adviser helping them through the process.
“The mission of the engagement fund is to give students the opportunity to start projects on campus that are related to USC,” Rhoads said.
He mentioned specific projects students are working on, including increasing the amount of native plants on campus and placing signage in dorms advocating resource consciousness.
Other projects include an initiative to make the dining halls more sustainable and create community gardens around campus.
A committee was organized to approve applications for funding that is made up of student leaders and administrators. The goal is to make sure the administrative figures that would needed to clear these projects on campus are represented on the funding board.
The committee will include Rhoads, a faculty member at large, three graduate students, three undergraduate students, the chair of the Sustainability Steering Committee, a staff member from Facilities Management Services and the sustainability program manager. Roughly $60,000 will be at the disposal of the committee, but Rhoads said that this number might increase.
“We are hoping to be able to review applications and give out funding in April,” Rhoads said. “We have a certain amount of money this year, and next year, that will be replenished, and these projects will carry over.”
Applications for funding from the Green Engagement Fund are available Wednesday, and will be available until April 6, at 9:30 a.m. They should be turned into the GSG’s office in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Next year, ESA will hold an application cycle in the fall and an application cycle in the spring. In the future, the committee’s hope is that Undergraduate Student Government and the university at large will adopt similar funding programs to increase sustainable initiatives at USC.

Eight LavaLab teams presented their preliminary pitches to an audience of entrepreneurs on Tuesday night. These teams will be matched up as their mentors in preparation for the organization’s noted Demo Night in April to present their potentially marketable products.
The private event was held at the General Assembly in Downtown Los Angeles and included a networking mixer at 7 p.m. before the pitches began at 8 p.m. In addition to group pitches, LavaLab teams were matched up with entrepreneurs in the audience who expressed interest in mentoring them during the creation phase of the project process.
“I think it’s overall just going to be a really great time because it’s going to be hosted off-campus so we get to mix with the mentors we’re going to be working with in a more real-life setting,” said Anubhav Sarkar, director of public relations for LavaLab, prior to the presentation portion of the event. “It’s going to be a lot of fun in a casual environment.”
LavaLab is an interdisciplinary student-run incubator that combines business, law and technology and gives eight teams of four or five people the opportunity to develop a startup product over 11-week curriculum.
“When you join as a team, the first meetings are how you brainstorm, how you come up with a good idea,” Zhang said. “You ask, ‘Is there a market for your idea?’”
From there, LavaLab teams transition into the prototyping phase of their ideas alongside entrepreneurial training.
“We teach everything from graphic design to public speaking to market feasibility,” Zhang said. “In between we have private speaking events featuring different entrepreneurs, each there for a specific teaching purpose.”
The last eight weeks consist of actual development of the project, which can include coding an application, developing a new form of social media or designing a useful household product.
“We like the kinds of people who are proactive and go out and seek opportunities,” Zhang said. “I think curating that kind of mentality creates a culture of building cool things.”
Pitch night consisted of three minute presentations followed by five-minute general crowd Q&A forum per team.
“As the halfway point of the curriculum, this is the checkpoint for our teams and a great opportunity for feedback,” Zhang said. “It’s a time when teams can say to mentors, ‘Here’s what I’m working on. What do you think of it?’”
One team pitched their idea for an application, Cache, which allows users to customize a savings plan that automatically transfers a selected amount of money on, say, a weekly or monthly basis for a specific product they want to purchase but cannot afford at the time.
“Cache is especially useful for saving for that midsize product,” said Syed Ibrahim, a junior majoring in business administration.
“It would be especially useful for younger people who struggle with saving and instant gratification,” said his teammate Nathan Reardon, a junior majoring in chemical engineering. “You know when the deadline is, and we’ll help you know how much to allocate.”
Another pitch, Travel Circle, allows users to connect with their friends and share information about where they have been on customized profiles.
“You can sort by countries or categories, like countries, waterfalls, parks or beaches,” said Alex Ogorek, a junior majoring in computer science. “If you add a place to your bucket list, you can see it in our profile, and if you click on one of your friend’s pictures, you can see where they’ve been. We’re targeting younger people, typically college students who are studying abroad and want to get firsthand insight on where to go.”
Sarkar presented his group’s proposed app, Zap, in which users challenge each other to dares of various parameters and timeframes. A newsfeed would consist of recipients providing photo or video proof of their accepted challenges.
“Zap lets you to see the crazy, new, exciting things those around you are doing,” Sarkar said. “Challenges aren’t always incentivized, but with Zap, you can raise the stakes by tossing money in.”
More networking followed the pitches and timed question and answer sessions, allowing mentors to approach the teams with additional questions and constructive criticism.
“I think the thing for everyone is how they’re actually going to get themselves out there in the market,” said Shane Webster, director of business development for The Noun Project. “It’s easy to make a product and put it on the App Store, but marketability is just as important as the idea.”
Zhang emphasized pitch night as a crucial precursor to Demo Night, a formal event in which teams present their more refined products to judges. He has high hopes the organization will continue to improve and produce marketable products.
“It’s really about continuing to build this less of a student organization and more of a program that outside people recognize,” Zhang said. “Two or three people have gotten job offers and it’s incredible knowing that this organization has played a role in their career development and professional life.”

Undergraduate Student Government presented a resolution to create a fall semester break for students on Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Andrew Menard, USG president and one of the resolution’s principal authors, spoke out on the urgency of having a fall break.
“This is something that students have advocated for a long time and really that advocacy has inspired us to continue working on this project,” Menard said. “We’re coming to a time when this fall break is more important than ever, as problems of mental health, stress and anxiety across college campuses are higher now than ever before, and are particularly amplified at intense academic institutions like USC. So this proposal in the most important one we’ve working on this year and will have the most positive impact on the largest number of students.”
Another of the resolution’s authors, USG chief of staff Hassaan Ebrahim, mentioned that this proposal comes amid troubling health surveys of USC students. These studies show that 88.7 percent of domestic and 73.4 percent of international students report feeling “overwhelmed by all they had to do,” and that 6.4 percent of domestic and 2.5 percent of international students report having  seriously considered suicide.
Hassan and Menard also highlighted that 24 of the top 30 universities in the U.S. News and World Report have at least one day off in the 11-week period between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. USC, however, is not among them.
“When you go to USC, you’re competing with the smartest people in the world every day; so in order to help increase your academic performance, you need a break to recharge your batteries, and this is statistically proven,” Menard said.
Menard said that there is an imbalance between the fall and spring semesters. During the fall semester there are 11 weeks of uninterrupted academic instruction, whereas during the spring semester the longest period of continuous instruction is 6 weeks.
Menard also described the many academic, professional and interpersonal possibilities that a fall break would allow students.
“You can take a biology trip to Catalina. You can do interviews for work and not miss class to do so, because on top of the pressure of your classes you also have the pressure to find an internship and a job,” Menard said. “Also, most of our students don’t get an opportunity to see their family until Thanksgiving or even until the holiday break.”
The resolution’s authors stressed the significant popular support behind a fall break. According to one survey, 93 percent of USC students responded that they would “personally benefit from a fall break” and 96 percent responded that a fall break would promote mental health by allowing students to rest.
Menard, who sits on the Academic Calendar Committee, also recounted the administrative support behind the resolution and the next steps involved.
“We brought this up during the first semester and the majority of us voted for the proposal. Now, that proposal goes to the provost for an ultimate review. It doesn’t happen automatically, but it is our recommendation that he approve it,” Menard said.
He further explained that the resolution should easily pass through the USG Senate but the final decision falls into the hands of either the interim provost or the future provost elect.
“The resolution, without a doubt, will pass through the Senate, and then it will be delivered to President Nikias, the Interim Provost Michael Quick and the chairman of the academic Board of Trustees. It is unclear whether the current provost or the one that is about to be selected will decide, but the students and the academic calendar committee are behind it.”
Menard concluded by stating one the primary hurdles in the approval of the resolution. He said that the biggest concern is over the fact that most faculty members do not want to have to submit grades so close to winter break.
“The well-being of our students needs to be the primary concern. USC exists for its students. Does a two-day break solve everything? No, but it is a good start and it will definitely have a positive impact.

At the end of the second day of the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas, the men’s golf team is in third place.
After the first day of competition, the team was in sixth place, shooting a combined 1-under 287. The second day of play fared much better for the Trojans as they settled into third place after combining for a second round 5-under 283 and moved into third at 6-under 570.
The Trojans trail the leader Oklahoma State by 12 and are 10 behind second-place Texas.
Freshman Sean Crocker finished with a 2-under 70 while senior Eric Sugimoto came in at 1-under 71 after the first day of competition. Crocker is competing for this third-straight top 5 finish. He opened up the first day with three birdies on the first nine holes before going 1-over on the back nine. At the conclusion of day one, Crocker was tied for 10th, five points back.
Sugimoto’s 1-under 71 tied his best spring round and left him tied for 16th heading into the second day. He was 1-under on the front nine holes and even on the final nine.
Sophomore Rico Hoey was tied for 27th at even 72, junior Bobby Gojuangco was tied for 50th at 2-over 74 and freshman Jonah Texeira was tied for 60th at 3-over 75 to round out the first day for the Trojans.
Crocker improved on a successful first day with an even better second day. Crocker shot a team-best 15th round in the 60s this season, a 5-under 67, while Hoey finished 3-under 69.
Crocker registered another strong round with seven birdies on the day. He went 3-under going on the first nine and 2-under on the back nine. He is tied for third at 7-under 137 (70-67), one behind the leader.
Hoey is tied for 14th at 3-under 141 (72-69). He was 2-under on the first nine holes, including an eagle on the par four fifth hole. He was still 2-under before finishing the final four holes with three birdies and a double bogey.
Sugimoto is tied for 20th at 1-under 143 (71-72), Gojuangco is tied for 57th at 5-over 149            (74-75), and Texeira is tied for 64th at 6-over 150 (75-75).
The Trojans look to continue to move up in the standing and overtake No. 1 Oklahoma State when the tournament concludes on Wednesday.

Let it be known that the Daily Trojan sports section officially jumped on the 2015 USC baseball team bandwagon before last week.
Regan Estes predicted over a month ago that the team would make the playoffs for the first time since 2005. I joined in a week later, waiting until after the Trojans had won their first three games before making the same prediction. Last week, just before the Trojans embarked on their season-defining home stand, Darian Nourian said that winning two out three games that week would validate that the Trojans are a playoff-caliber team.
The Trojans did even better than that. After receiving those three big endorsements, the Trojans went on to win three very big games. They passed each test against national powerhouses, a title that now sounds apt again for USC baseball.
The Trojans got off to their hottest start since 1988 by winning their first 12 games of the season. They narrowly dropped a 3-2 ballgame at UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday, March 3 for their first loss of the season but had a great opportunity to rebound that weekend. On Friday, the Trojans would host TCU, followed by Vanderbilt the following day then capped off by UCLA on Sunday. TCU came into the matchup as the No. 7 team in the country according to the USA Today national coaches poll, with Vanderbilt — the defending national champions — at No. 4 and UCLA No. 6.
The Trojans battled the Horned Frogs for 12 innings before claiming a 7-6 victory. A squeeze bunt from junior third baseman Blake Lacey plated junior center fielder Timmy Robinson for the winning run.
After walking off the night before, the Trojans also went on to beat Vanderbilt in walk-off fashion, with freshman pinch hitter Adalberto Carrillo’s home run ending the game.
To cap it all off, in front of an announced crowd of 14,688 fans at Dodger Stadium, the Trojans took down crosstown rival UCLA by a score of 8-4.
There’s a wide variety of national polls listed on the NCAA website, and the Trojans ranked pretty consistently on all of them after last week. The Trojans are up to No. 14 in the National College Baseball Writers Association poll, No. 13 in the D1Baseball.com poll and No. 9 in the Baseball America poll  and No. 12 in the USA Today national poll.
I wouldn’t say that this weekend proves that USC is the best team in the country. If the football team had just beat UCLA, TCU and the SEC’s best team in three consecutive games, that would be a different story. Not only would that scenario likely involve winning at least two of the NCAA football’s playoff games, but baseball requires a uniquely large sample size when making judgments compared to other sports.
It’s not unheard of for a college football team to go undefeated in a season. In fact it’s even happened before in the NFL. In basketball we’ve seen plenty of teams go undefeated in the regular season including this year’s Kentucky squad. While it hasn’t happened in the NBA, it’s not uncommon for teams to go on winning streaks of 20 or more games.
Baseball, on the other hand, is much more fluctuating. In the MLB, even the best teams will only win about 60 percent of their games in a season, and the worst teams will still win at least 40 percent of their games most years.
If a star slugger has a batting average of .400 and he goes four for five in one game, that means on average he will go over five the following game.
So that’s why I’m not putting too much stock into last weekend’s performance for this year’s baseball team. There is still a lot of baseball left to be played for the Trojans the season.
The road won’t exactly get easier for the Trojans, either. Four of the  Pac-12 schools sit in the USA Today Top 25, with another four receiving votes. Based off of those numbers, eight teams from the conference should be amongst the 64 teams invited to play in the postseason.
But on a grander scheme, the start to this years Trojan baseball season is indicative of tremendous progress for the program. It’s shocking to think that this program, which has won more national championships than any other team, has not even made the playoffs in 10 seasons. You’d have to go all the way back to 2005 to find the last time the Trojans appeared in the NCAA baseball postseason. Not even men’s basketball, a team that has nowhere near the history as baseball and is known for really struggling recently, has had that long of a dry spell. The men’s basketball team last made an appearance in the March Madness basketball tournament in 2011. And yes, I’m still confident that our team this year could hypothetically make the NCAA tournament if the Trojans can put it together in the Pac-12 tournament this week.
But back to baseball. We are pretty close to positive that this years team will make the postseason.
Barring any major wrath of injuries, this team should finish in the top 25, let alone the top 64. Much the same way that basketball programs like Duke or Kentucky can guarantee invitations to the NCAA tournament before each season, the USC baseball team can now start to count on that almost every season.
In his three years as head coach of the baseball team, Dan Hobbs has brought in three recruiting classes ranked as top 25 classes by baseball America. That effort on the recruiting trail is finally bearing out as results on the diamond. And it doesn’t sound like that meteoric road and improvement is going to stop anytime soon.
Again, that doesn’t mean that USC will become a dominating national powerhouse that wins national championships year in and year out like it did in the past. There is much more parity in college baseball as well as all of college sports, meaning there is much more competition amongst perennial powerhouses every season. But the Trojans will certainly be in competition for the national championship year in and year out. The 10-year playoff drought will be over. In fact, it will probably be another 10 seasons until the Trojans don’t make the playoffs. And eventually, all these trips to the College World Series will eventually result in another national championship in Heritage Hall.
So if you’re a little late to the show — we get it, plenty of Dodger fans don’t make it out until about the third inning — now would be the time to  jump on that bandwagon. Because if you haven’t heard by now, let it be known that USC baseball is back.

After a spectacular comeback bid fell just one point short against crosstown rival UCLA last week, the women’s tennis looks to return to winning ways against San Diego State on Wednesday. The Women of Troy had been looking to extend a six-game winning run going into their matchup against the Bruins, but they will now try to start a fresh streak by taking care of the Aztecs at Marks Stadium.
Despite the close loss to archrivals UCLA, associate head coach West Nott insisted that “nothing has changed” in the squad’s preparations for game day.
“Have a good practice, control the things you can control and just get back out there on the court and rack up another win,” Nott said when asked about the team’s mentality heading into the contest.
No. 4 USC now sports a 10-2 record and an undefeated 4-0 mark at home, while San Diego State is 6-5 for the season and has not lost in almost a month. After a rough 2-5 start, the Aztecs notched four consecutive victories to push their record over .500, and they will look to make it five in their upset bid against the Women of Troy.
USC travelled to San Diego in 2014 and came away with a dominant 7-0 victory, but neither the players nor the coaches are taking the win for granted this year.
“If we can keep working on the things we’ve been working on, the rest will just fall into place,” Nott said. “We won’t be taking them lightly.”
Six USC players are currently nationally ranked in singles, led by No. 18 junior Giuliana Olmos. The other ranked Women of Troy include two seniors,        No. 36 Sabrina Santamaria and                No. 46 Zoë Scandalis, while         No. 88 Gabby Smith, No. 83 Meredith Xepoleas and No. 65 Madison Westby are all freshmen. Olmos and Scandalis are also the 17-ranked doubles partnership in the country, and sophomore Zoë Katz and senior Gabriella DeSimone are currently ranked at No. 27.
After the loss against UCLA last week, head coach Richard Gallien identified doubles as an area for improvement, and the team has been working to improve that aspect of their game throughout the week.
“We’ve got some new players, and gelling takes a little bit of time, especially just handling the pressure of a dual match,” Nott said. “We’ve been working really hard, and the kids are learning very quickly so I wouldn’t be surprised if we played great doubles [against San Diego State.]”
The players and coaching staff have also been working on maintaining full, NCAA tournament-esque intensity over the course of a full match.
“We’re working on our overall consistency as a team, not giving away any free points, just making every point, set and match contested from the beginning to the end and playing a full, complete performance,” Nott said.
USC and San Diego State do not share many common fixtures in their seasons, as the Aztecs play in the Mountain West Championship, but comparing results against their lone mutual opponent — Pepperdine — inspires confidence. San Diego State fell to the Waves by a score of 5-2 in their lone meeting of the spring, while the Women of Troy beat Pepperdine twice in the same week back in January, with a 4-0 win at home and a 4-3 victory in Malibu.
The Women of Troy know, however, that any lower-ranked team visiting Marks Stadium will be prepared to upset them and are ready to meet the challenge.
“We take them very seriously even though they aren’t ranked as high[ly] as us,” Santamaria said. “We’re preparing very well, and we’re going to treat [the game] like it’s UCLA or Stanford or Cal and just take care of business.”
The match begins Wednesday at Marks Stadium at 1:30 p.m., and it is the Women of Troy’s final contest before conference play begins at Washington State on Sunday.

In a quest for the ultimate upset, the Trojans start off the annual Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas this week as the No. 12 seed. The Trojans will face off against the Arizona State Sun Devils, the No. 6 seed, on Wednesday.
The Trojans hope that this tournament will be a bright spot in a season that saw the Trojans finish last in the conference for the second consecutive year. They ended their season with a loss to their crosstown rivals UCLA by a final score of 85-74. The Trojans allowed the Bruins to go on a 25-7 run in the first half, and they could never catch up. Redshirt sophomore Katin Reinhardt led the way in the loss with 22 points off the bench; the Trojans will rely on his scoring in the tournament during which they will continue to be underdogs every night.
The Trojans are one of the youngest teams in the entire country; among the power five conferences, the Trojans have the youngest roster in terms of minutes played by class. Head coach Andy Enfield knows that his team is young, but he also knows they will go out ready to compete.
“We understand that from a physicality standpoint and from an age difference, they’re much older and a little stronger than us physically,” Enfield said. “We feel that if we go compete, we have a great chance.”
Arizona State will come into the tournament having won five of its last seven games, a run that catapulted them to the five seed in the tournament. Their last win was over California by a margin of 74-70 in which they were led by senior forward Shaquielle McKissic, who scored 21 points in his last home game for the Sun Devils. McKissic is the leading scorer for the Devils with an average of 11.5 points per game.
The last time these USC and ASU faced off, the Sun Devils came away on top, 64-59. The Devils had to rally late to beat the Trojans, who had led for the majority of the game. In this game, USC was led by reserve sophomore guard Kahlil Dukes who scored a career-high 18 points. Dukes kept the Trojans in a game where they were missing three of their players. Reinhardt, junior guard Chass Bryan and sophomore guard Devon Pflueger were all sent home from the Arizona road trip for violating team rules.
USC will not head into Vegas at full strength, as freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin is out for the season with a shoulder injury. McLaughlin was named to the Pac-12 all-freshman team on Monday. On the season, McLaughlin averaged 12.1 points, three rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. He led all Pac-12 freshman in assists and steals per game, and he is the first Trojan to be named to the team since Maurice Jones back in 2011.
Without McLaughlin, the Trojans will lean on their two dynamic sophomores against Arizona State. Sophomore guard Julian Jacobs has proven lately why he was named captain of the squad, both with his production on the court and through his leadership on such a young team. In the last seven games for the Trojans, Jacobs averaged 11.9 points, 6.6 rebounds and seven assists per game. Jacobs has also been able to entertain the crowd as he leads the team with 18 dunks on the year. USC will also routinely go down low to sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic, who averaged 12.2 points and 7.1 rebounds per game for the Trojans during the regular season. Jacobs stressed preparation when he talked about the pending tournament.
“You have to have a chip on your shoulder when you play in these kind of tournaments where it’s win or go home,” Jacobs said.
The game will tip off at 2:30 p.m. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The winner of the game will go on to face the UCLA Bruins, who earned a first round bye by placing fourth in the conference during the regular season. USC lost to UCLA in both matchups this year while the Sun Devils won the only meeting with the Bruins earlier in the year.
ASU is the fifth seed which you state in the headline of the article. Why then are they the sixth seed in the first paragraph?

Madonna is pop music’s matriarch. Since her explosion into music in the ’80s and her “Like a Virgin” era, she has continually reinvented herself to last through wave after wave of music. Her newest release, Rebel Heart, has the veteran unapologetically asserting dominance in her genre.
To start, Madonna managed to get some of the best modern talent in pop music onto this album. Nicki Minaj, Chance the Rapper and Nas are all featured on the album. Additionally, Kanye West, Diplo and Avicii produced tracks — giving Madonna’s 13th studio album the shine of one of a younger artist. Much of the album concerns Madonna realizing her stardom and iconic nature, as evidenced by the tracks “Iconic” and “Bitch I’m Madonna.” She is far more than an artist these days.
The ’80s sex idol left her mark on pop music, and there are few artists in the industry today who cannot attribute at least some portion of their sound to Madonna. She is iconic and she knows it, as she references her status in several tracks.
“I can, Icon, two letters apart/ One step, away, of being lost in the dark/ Just shine your light like a beautiful star/ Show the world who you are/ Who you are” sings the artist on “Iconic” featuring Chance the Rapper. The track received attention when it was released, as people were intrigued by a collaboration between the queen of pop and an up-and-coming rapper; though ths song it is a little cheesy and a little too upbeat, it has hit qualities.
Though all the pre-released tracks are pop and EDM tracks, there are plenty of slower ballads on the album, with almost as much emotional instrumentation as there is radio fodder. One beautiful track, “Wash All Over Me,” — though it is classic Madonna — is still fresh and somewhat heartbreaking. If the EDM hits appeal to her icon image, these ballads are the real Madonna. She sings about how hard it is to be constantly in the spotlight, about love and about herself as more than just a sex symbol. Many critics consider this personal touch to be the album’s best quality, and rightfully so as Madonna bears all for this record.
“Wash All Over Me,” like many tracks on Rebel Heart, uses unique sounds to achieve its aims. In this case, it’s the sound of a drumline distorted to sound like a syncopated heartbeat, giving the whole song its texture. It sounds like an upbeat, hopeful version of “House of the Rising Sun” by Animals, and it truly shines as one of the most underrated songs on the album.
Though Madonna is now 56, she is still unafraid to confront the topic that made her famous: sex. A majority of the tracks on Rebel Heart are about sex — there is one blatantly titled “S.E.X.” — and one employing a pretty poorly thought out metaphor to religion entitled “Holy Water.” She’s a sex icon, and though she is of the age of most moms, Madonna is still making music that would make mothers uncomfortable. In “S.E.X.,” Madonna describes in great depth her sexual knowledge, references many intense sexual positions and practices such as using handcuffs and whips; the lyrics make pretty much anyone listening squirm a little. In the ’80s, all it took was comparing herself to a virgin to spark controversy, but now, it seems it takes much, much more. With 19 tracks on Rebel Heart, her 13th album, they can’t all be good. When you’ve been making music for 30 years you’re allowed a few duds here and there.
Closing out the album is the title track “Rebel Heart,” a fun, hopeful song about Madonna’s rebellious nature and how she made a name for herself as such. If this album tells the story of her career, this song is the retrospective. Her album focuses on her past, her music, her sexual persona and her personal life, all culminating in this song about how good it is to be a rebel.
Madonna is one of the most recognizable names to ever come out of the music industry, and she opened the door for artists to be comfortable with exploring sexual material while making herself into a pop icon. This album is good. It may not be the Madonna you expect from the ’80s, nor is it a fine tuned pop album made for the radio today, but it is certainly worth a listen, if only to hear the likes of Nicki Minaj and Chance the Rapper working with one of the most relevant pop artists of all time.

It is strange to think that something so complex can sound so simple, but that’s the very magic behind Hey Rosetta! The seven-piece indie rock band released their newest album, Second Sight, this January . They will be accompanying the release with a North American Tour stopping in Los Angeles on March 11 to perform at Bootleg Hifi.
Hey Rosetta! currently consists of lead singer, guitarist and pianist Tim Baker, bassist and backing vocalist Josh Ward, lead guitarist Adam Hogan and drummer Phil Maloney, as well as violinist Kinley Dowling, cellist Romesh Thavanathan and horn player Mara Pellerin. Second Sight is the band’s first album in four years, and they took their time with good reason. The album sees them explore new aspects of their sound and expand their ability to infuse various techniques.
The band began after Baker returned from traveling the world with an arsenal of songs. He matched that with an army of musicians to bring his songs further than their acoustic origins. From the very beginning, Hey Rosetta! has garnered attention for their potential. Their 2010 album, Seeds, saw the band adapting to its new international fame. With Second Sight, however, the band has settled into its place in the music scene with a mature sound.
In cooperation with the Fogo Island Arts residency, the band released a short film of their live performances as well as candid videos of them exploring the island. The film incorporates standard indie scenes of empty roads, greyish skies, rocky landscapes and a background of a bleak-looking ocean. The band is also seen skipping rocks, playing around and generally humanizing themselves to their fans. As they play their music, it becomes clear that Hey Rosetta! is not one entity, but a collection of individuals who lose and find themselves in their instruments and come together like a puzzle.
Despite being a seven-piece band, Hey Rosetta! shows harmonious artistic coherence. Their music is not cluttered or overwrought, and the sound is built up in layers with a rich, spine-tingling result. In a world of indie rockers, Hey Rosetta! is not groundbreaking or trendsetting, but there is something in their simple, unassuming nature that makes them intoxicating. Their music does not rely on dramatic drops or overwhelming beats. What starts as soft, mellow indie swells into a wave of their original  surround sound.
Their new album begins with “Soft Offering (For the Oft Suffering),” a song about what the morning brings. Baker’s carefully crafted lyrics convey a unique, raw and honest sincerity. His rough yet crooning voice melts into the music. The song itself starts slow until the drums kick in. Then as the music layers in, it becomes buoyant. The beginning sets sets a positive but introspective tone that stems throughout the entire album.
The leading single for the album, “Kintsukuroi,” is a song for an ex-lover without the usual sorrow-filled music. It follows the bubbly-ness of “Soft Offering” with a bigger dose of rock. Baker sings to the past lover, “bring that summer on your shoulders/ bring that summer when I first saw you/ and that first kiss coming/ let’s just freeze the frame/ your blue eyes closing as mine were opening.” But the song is not a downer, carrying a sunny vibe instead. It begins with a fun and purposefully messy intro that transitions into a dance tune with synth tones reminiscent of early Bombay Bicycle Club.
The album closes with “Trish’s Song,” which is a solid display of Baker’s lyrical style. His lyrics are simple and use very few words while still expressing large and complex feelings. “Trish’s Song” is reminiscent of a lullaby. Despite being written four years prior, the song blends into the softness of the entire album. Baker notes that he was exploring a relationship that had ended a year before, and whether or not Trish is the ex-lover, it’s clear Baker still cares. Hey Rosetta!’s true originality comes from Baker’s ability to express many contradicting emotions at once — sorrow, loss, intimacy, joy and everything in-between. Baker sings, “I will watch over you/ nothing will go wrong / I won’t sit until you’re strong,” and the song does exactly that; it sits with the listener even after the album has ended, leaving a sense of serenity and grace.
Hey Rosetta! is not on a path to redefine music, nor is it creating a new genre. But Hey Rosetta! doesn’t need to. They encompass various interests, various emotions and various sounds, but the beauty with which they put them together is what defines them. As the album begins, it becomes more and more clear how easy it is to get lost within the harmonies of the instruments and the calming voice of Baker. Hey Rosetta! is known for its engaged and energetic live concerts. Their reputation for charisma and liveliness paired with the nature of their music promises a memorable experience.

This past Sunday marked more than just one less hour of sleep. March 8 was the 107th annual International Women’s Day — a date heralding the forward progression of our clocks as well as that of the feminist movement.
Naturally, the woman that Elle UK has crowned the “fresh new face of feminism” was at the forefront of mainstream IWD celebrations, broadcasting a live Q&A to address issues of gender equality at the Facebook headquarters in London, England. This woman is Emma Watson, and she’s ramming feminism into Western consciousness.
As the U.N. Goodwill Ambassador proved last September when she gave a speech at the U.N. Headquarters on behalf of the HeForShe movement, Watson is more than just a pretty face using philanthropy to bolster her star power. In reality, her intentions are quite the opposite; Watson has applied her celebrity status to garner support for the modern feminist movement. As Watson proved this Sunday with her comprehensive Q&A, just because the gender equality movement has a long way to go doesn’t mean we can’t appreciate what we’ve accomplished.
A piece in Forbes paints an encouraging picture of the female role in the global labor force. As of right now, women make up almost a fifth of the 114th Congress, and 63 percent of Americans feel that “the country would be better governed if more women held elected office.” Moreover, the number of female billionaires on Forbes’ annual ranking of the world’s billionaires has increased by 90 percent in the past three years. Women are also starting 1,200 new businesses a day — 65 percent more than last year. Of course, the patriarchy persists; Forbes cites the head of U.N. Women’s remark that it will be another 81 years until women will have as high a chance of becoming CEOs as men and 50 years more before women will have the same chance of leading a country.
Yet, the fight for equality continues, and feminism has garnered some serious media attention in recent months. Criticisms aside, organizations such as HeForShe have proved instrumental in engaging mainstream attention for the feminist cause. The organization aims to incorporate men and boys into the feminist movement, stressing the idea that sexism is harmful to everyone and that all gender identities must be included in the conversation in order to progress. The organization has already amassed an impressive amount of support — online and otherwise — with more than 250,000 men worldwide having signed the online pledge already.
Naturally, the organization’s focus on its online presence, apparent exclusion of alternate gender identities and primary goal of garnering male support has elicited a good deal of skepticism. Thankfully, hosting a Q&A with Emma Watson at Facebook’s headquarters on International Women’s Day allowed the organization to address these issues and highlight its message even further. When addressing the organization’s goals, Watson clarified that HeForShe is not about men saving women. Watson said, “I think that’s a misunderstanding. Women are already in the club because it’s our movement. It’s an equality club, for both genders. It’s about men coming in support of women and women coming in support of men.”
In terms of the organization’s effectiveness, HeForShe has clearly made a huge impact throughout the world. Watson recalled receiving numerous letters from anonymous teenage boys and explicit support from President Barack Obama, actor Matt Damon and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moo.
Watson also made sure to touch on intersectionality and the importance of inclusivity. She acknowledged her own privilege as a white celebrity, concluding that “it’s then [her] responsibility to then make sure that other women do have access, making sure that what [she has] been lucky enough to see in my life extends out to others.” She recognized the “interlocking” nature of oppression and that “intersectionality is a key word here,” and she explicitly stated that the LGBTQ community be included in this movement.
Overall, I see Watson as a perfect liaison between Western culture and the feminist movement — passionate, brilliant, unapologetically assertive and entirely philanthropic. I have no doubt that Watson will continue to better address intersectionality, but the primary concern is making the basic concept of gender equality a mainstream issue. HeForShe has a long way to go, as does feminism overall, but we are getting there — awareness is growing at an exponential rate, and we refuse to be silenced.

As the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity.
If this is the case, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie should be grateful for his recent wave of free publicity. Headlines involving the governor grandly proclaim “Christie’s Delusions of Presidential Grandeur,” “Christie is Fading Fast” and “Everybody Hates Chris Christie.” The general consensus, explicitly stated in a recent New York Times editorial, “Adieu, Chris Christie, Adieu,” is that Christie is political toast.
With about 20 months until the election, however, it is much too soon to completely disregard Christie’s chances at the Republican nomination, or even at the presidency. Political toast would be ignored, not invited to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Political toast would be shying away from public life, not making appearances at town halls and fundraising meetings. Political toast would be holding their tongue, not brashly “giving up the New York Times for Lent.”
It is precisely this brashness that initially contributed to Christie’s rise in prominence. Loud and unapologetic, Christie gained a following through his emotionally driven, authentic personality.  After Hurricane Sandy, he earned national attention for embracing President Barack Obama, and for his notorious fleece jacket, which had short-lived fame with its own Twitter account.
In those days, things looked pretty good for Christie. The media portrayed him as a moderate, a potential panacea to the Republican party’s far-right woes. He bounced back from slip-ups, like when he chased a nay-sayer with his ice cream cone or told a heckler to “sit down and shut up.”
These slip-ups simply played into Christie’s persona — a bona-fide New Jerseyan who stuck true to his roots and to his guns. Having been featured on both TMZ and CNN, Christie graduated from the ranks of the average politician into the realm of celebrity-politician hybrids.  Given Christie’s personality, it’s safe to say that he won’t be out of the race until he, not the media, decides he’s out of the race.
Of course, the media isn’t attacking Christie without good reason.  A recent CBS News poll placed Jeb Bush, a man with an even more recognizable name, in first place, with 49 percent of Republicans saying they’d vote for him for president. Christie placed ninth out of 11 potential candidates, spurring the media push against Christie.
Even the poll itself, however, suggests it’s too early to disregard Christie. Yes, 49 percent of Republican respondents said they’d vote for Bush, but 25 percent said they didn’t know enough about Bush yet to make a decision. This sentiment echoed throughout the poll, with more than a quarter of voters polled saying they didn’t know enough yet to make a decision about each listed candidate. As we approach the election, voters will know more, and only then will polls allow us to discount contenders.
Christie’s dismal polling numbers could easily be attributed to his more recent, more serious slip-ups. The innocent days of waving ice cream cones are over. To some, the well-publicized Bridgegate scandal transformed Christie’s brashness from admirable to malicious. Additionally, instead of praise for being a moderate, Christie has recently received flack for failing to take a firm stance on hot button issues such as abortion. The fact that Christie is still a presidential contender, however, exhibits resiliency, and that he is not ready to back down from the race.
And even if Christie’s numbers are poor, his brash personality keeps voters intrigued. Political commentators such as Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, wrote in a recent editorial, “His physical appearance, swagger and tone all make him fascinating to millions of voters. They aren’t sure if they’ll agree with him, but they want to hear what he will say next.”
This shows Christie’s enduring relevance; Americans love political characters. Yes, his polling numbers are down, but there’s 20 months for Christie to return to the unique, authentic political persona which became his claim to fame. There’s 20 months for him to turn the polls around. This isn’t to argue that he absolutely will turn the polls around and win the election — the 20 months merely means that there is a chance, not a certainty.
With these 20 months between us and election season, it’s premature to call Christie’s political career toast. Voters aren’t informed enough for the polls to be relevant, though as long as Christie remains a conversation topic, he’ll remain relevant.
Bridgegate hasn’t been forgotten yet, and pending investigations could be the final nail in the toaster. But until then, to use Christie’s own words, everyone needs to “sit down and shut up,” and let the primaries run their course.

CREAM’s opening this past weekend saw mountains of delicious ice cream, decadent cookies, and inhumanly long lines. Oh, the lines.
The opening of CREAM drew humongous crowds for many of the same reasons that it will become the popular ice cream sandwich place: mostly, it’s delicious and also cheap — the sweet spot that launches so many food venues around USC to success. And it also fills a previously untapped consumer market for ice cream cookie sandwiches — CREAM will become our Diddy Riese. And finally, there’s the element of novelty to grand openings that draws in scores of consumers and that creates the brand loyalty that CREAM will inevitably foster: it’s the newest form of deliciousness around campus.
The neuroscience behind novelty has been well-documented; research has proven that new experiences and ideas stimulate the brain to release dopamine, the pleasure-seeking pathway. But consider that, on a philosophical level, new things are just old things recycled — this isn’t the first time we’ve seen the concept of placing ice cream between cookies, or even the first CREAM. There can never be anything, then, that is truly new.
It’s a concept that stems most directly from determinism — the concept that all events are caused by a past event. It renders impossible spontaneity, and by extension, novelty.
A cynical person would deduce from this that novelty is a concept crafted by humans to create meaning in our lives. And perhaps the cynic would be correct. An obsession with the latest thing, be it ice cream or iPhones, makes us feel as though events are evolving. CREAM is great because it’s new, but it’s also great because it’s delicious. And at some point that ice cream was something else entirely. Maybe it’s rather beautiful that new things — new objects or new events — are reimaginings of old ones.
I could really use an ice cream sandwich.

This spring break, I spent my time a bit differently than I would in the United States, and embarked on the classic four-countries-in-ten-days excursion with nothing but a backpack and iPhone camera in tow. In just over a week, my traveling buddy and I managed to make our way to Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
We visited four different cities during our journey: Munich, Vienna, Budapest and Prague respectively. To say we covered a lot of ground would be an understatement, and I’m pretty sure I’ll need a good ten hours of sleep per night for the next week and a half to recover. However, for a newbie traveler such as myself, I could not suggest a better way to begin a lifetime of adventures abroad than to backpack across Europe – especially if you are going out of the country for the first time.
Despite only being in each city for a day and a half before having to pick up and hop on a train again, my friend and I found this type of traveling highly beneficial in that we got to sample a great deal of Central Europe. Being able to get a taste of each country gave us enough of a chance to form an opinion about it, and decide whether or not we’d like to return in the future and spend more time getting to know the country. For instance, there is still plenty of Hungarian food I need to try in Budapest, and public bathhouses to visit, as well as the famous five-story club in Prague.
For those of you interested in post-graduate travels, or plan to study abroad in the near future, here are a few useful pointers I’ve learned on the way:
After experiencing the struggle of carrying a rolling suitcase while in Venice, I learned the hard way that backpacks and duffle bags are the way to go. The day before I left, I invested in a backpack the size of a carryon suitcase, and it was probably one of the best travel decisions I’ve made in a while. Not only can you fit everything you need for a whole ten days, but it’s fairly lightweight and leaves you hands-free. You can purchase yours here.
When doing a lot of traveling, it’s a smart idea to stay organized and do your research. It’s great starting out with some sort of idea of what you plan to do and see in a country, but more importantly, it’s vital to roll with the punches. Just like everyday life, nothing ever goes according to plan 100 percent of the time, which is why it’s helpful to take a deep breath and loosen the reins once and a while. You never know – that one exhibition you were dying to see but turned out to be closed could lead to you finding a great hole-in-the-wall restaurant to eat at that you would have never come across otherwise.
There is no better way to get to know a place than to interact with the people who live there. Whether you are staying in a hostel, or out and about enjoying the city, take a second to ask around where the best places to eat at are, what views are to die for, and where you can find the cheapest deals.
This one is still a work-in-progress for me (to say the least), but is probably one of the most important skills to have when traveling. More likely than not, you will not have access to Wi-Fi when you are out wandering the city in foreign lands. It’s helpful to have some idea of how to read a map (and trust me, you will acquire a bunch going from place to place), as well as being able to understand and navigate foreign Metro/Subway systems. Using public transportation to get from place to will you save you a ton of money on cab fare.
For me, one of the best parts of traveling is tasting every country’s traditional food. Out of the four countries we visited, I’d say that Prague had the best food. Not only was it absolutely delicious, but also extremely cheap. I ate a rack of baby back ribs and plate of French fries for the equivalent of $6 USD. Interestingly enough, goulash was an original dish in Austria, Hungary, and Czech Republic, however, each country made theirs differently. I wasn’t a fan of goulash until I got to Prague, where they made their version less of a stew, and more of a solid meal. Who would’ve known that Czech and Hungarian food would become my new two favorite cuisines!
After a whirlwind of adventure, I was so happy to return to Florence, which has become a second home to me, more so than Los Angeles has in the past two years. The longer I stay here, the more I connect with Italy’s people and fall in love with the city and Italian culture. Spring break was a blast, but it’s great to have a home base.
Ciao, belli!
