Student reading habits aren’t what they used to be, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is entering its second year in its new home, and books look significantly different than they did even five years ago. Any way you look at it, reading — both here at USC and in the world beyond our campus — is undergoing a fundamental turn of the page.

We’ve already watched the music video evolve. Modern music videos now tend to focus on the celebrity performer rather than the content of the song, and plot-driven videos like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” seemed extinct until Lady GaGa introduced the controversial “Telephone” in 2010.
Now it seems that another type of video is entering the music scene —the lyric video.
Instead of featuring intimate shots of the performer or choreography good enough to borrow for day-to-day life, the lyric video primarily focuses on the lyrics of a particular song, playing them on-screen in time with the music. Though colorful graphics temporarily hold attention, lyric videos tend to give off a somewhat lazy vibe —it often feels that a company was too preoccupied to invest time and money in an actual video shoot.
Certainly it’s helpful to have the lyrics of a song flashing on the screen, but these lyric videos seem to lack a certain amount of artistry. In some cases, such as in David Guetta and Usher’s “Without You,” the artists never appears in the video, forcing the viewer to watch a series of interesting but tiresome graphics that get old well before the three-minute video is over. (Thankfully, Guetta and Usher released a second version of “Without You” that is more traditional and entertaining.)
To be fair, lyric videos do have their place. Reminiscent of the “sing-along videos” of our elementary days, lyric videos can be helpful when we just want to turn up the television set and shout lyrics that we haven’t quite learned yet. But these videos do seem to cater to a younger audience. Disney Channel stars like Selena Gomez and the cast of Lemonade Mouth for “Love You Like A Love Song” and “Somebody,” respectively, tend to be more likely to make use of the lyric video; the fun but effortless form of entertainment often makes good commercial time.
But then more mature artists like The Wanted and Maroon 5 trade successful videos for a simpler, lyrical format. The Wanted’s “Glad You Came” demonstrated that the boy band knew how to combine a great song with an equally great music video, but then their recent release, “Chasing the Sun” features a dull lyric video that, even with flashing lights, remains low-energy. Maroon 5’s “Payphone” follows this same ideology.  Though “Payphone” makes good use of the detailed drawings and thought bubbles of a comic book, the video’s repetitive shots makes the viewer long for a more thought-provoking video like “Never Gonna Leave This Bed.”
This is not to say that lyrics don’t have a place in music cinema, but artists should have a balance between the spoken and the visual. For example, Rihanna’s single “You Da One” makes sure that fans see her latest provocative performance even as she flashes a few phrases on screen. The same holds true for 2010’s “Rude Boy.” Most of the video features a dancing Rihanna with colorful and non sequitur backgrounds, but a couple of key words flash on the screen for emphasis. The lyrics don’t make up the content of the video.
Hopefully, the lyric video will just remain a placeholder for an artist who hasn’t had time to work on a traditional music video. Sometimes, it’s a stellar film that makes an average song successful.

SCALE has always been a joke.
Simply an embarrassment!   Most of those girls had no business wearing anything that exposes the belly.  I am sure if they peeled back a few labels inside of those ill fitting cloths they would find a variety of socialist totalitarian dictatorships which they find so appealing.
As for the metro-sexual men and beards who were accompanying the ladies, remove those cheap Chinese made sunglasses and the turned around baseball caps as they make you look far to Western.  Next time try a Mao coat and and hat.
Oh yes, it isn’t the Peoples Socialist March Against Oppression without one “Che” bearded guy in the back row of the Bookstore steps.  Next time you’ll lose the straw had and have your beret….
Happy 4:20!

Nevertheless, the Daily Trojan has found that books still serve as important tools on and off campus. It’s important to remember that, before Google existed, the book was the primary medium that made learning possible. Moreover, the printed word remains one of the most authoritative source of information in the modern world.
As a testament to the legacy of the printed word, USC is hosting the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. The acquisition of an event of this caliber represents our university’s best qualities: the free exchange of ideas, the search for knowledge, the coming together of like-minded individuals and the bettering of oneself.
As such, serving as host symbolizes both the university’s past and its progress as an intellectual powerhouse.
Though USC is a cutting-edge university that takes advantage of technology — including e-readers and iPads — the Daily Trojan has found that most students continue to enjoy the tangible experience of print books.
In addition, the festival offers the university an opportunity to showcase its faculty members, including festival panelists Aimee Bender and T.C. Boyle.
USC’s collaboration with the Los Angeles Times also brings celebrity-authors Betty White, Bethenny Frankel and Tori Spelling to campus, which in turn brings more visitors. As a result, we are able to use books to highlight the allure of USC.
But the festival is about more than books as a medium, or about the university’s move up the ladder of success. The university is invested in the conversations happening beyond its immediate community.
Though books aren’t exactly glamorous, they still have the ability to bring more than 140,000 people together to gain knowledge and share the ideas that inspire them. The fact that this university is able to bring so many people together is an honor — but it’s also representative of our school’s far-reaching responsibilities.

With the onset of warmer weather and the last day of classes just a week away, one can practically hear the final sighs of spring in the air. There’s another sound, though, and it’s virtually inescapable.
It’s the pervasive clanking of tent construction.
The sea of white tents and stages around campus signals the arrival of the 17th annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, a sprawling, two-day celebration of reading and writing — the nation’s largest event of its kind.

This year’s event features almost 300 booths, hosting a variety of exhibitors, from booksellers and publishers to cultural organizations. There’s also a long list of intriguing participating authors, including Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and acclaimed food writer Jonathan Gold.
It’s worth noting that this year’s festival will mark only the second time that USC hosts the event. For 15 years, the festival took place on crosstown rival UCLA’s Westwood campus. The shift to USC’s campus was motivated by numerous factors, including the Los Angeles Times’ desire to make the event more conveniently accesible to all L.A. residents, as well as to foster future growth.
“It wasn’t that we were looking to leave UCLA, per se, but rather to move somewhere more centrally located in relation to the rest of the city,” said Maret Orliss, the senior programming manager for the Times.
Orliss noted that USC’s status as a private university also had its benefits.
“There were possibilities for USC to expand the festival that UCLA could not match — not through any fault of their own,” Orliss said, “but simply due to USC’s being a private university where you can just talk to someone to make a decision, whereas UCLA is a state university and often presents a longer process.”
The festival’s budget also raised some strife: Negotiations between the Times and UCLA regarding how to share expenses became an issue of contention, with budget cuts to the UC system making it difficult for the school to support the festival, according to a September 2010 Times report.
Ellie Launer, a junior majoring in theater at UCLA, said though it seems many current students didn’t actively participate in the festival when it was held on UCLA’s campus, the move away from the school was still disappointing.
“With all of the protests and budget cuts, I feel the festival wasn’t a huge priority [for] the school’s administrators,” Launer said. “It was a really great opportunity, though, and I had a great time. It’s a shame the underclassmen never got to see it here.”

As was hoped, the Festival of Books indeed saw growth in its first year at USC, with an unprecedented number of visitors — more than 140,000 — and a huge increase in the number of book drive donations, from 800 to 4,000. This year’s festival presents further expansion still, with more exhibitors and events than ever as well as the establishment of a food truck court on Cromwell Field — a response to visitors’ demands for more dining options in an open setting.
Other new features include a greater focus on the School of Cinematic Arts. Orliss noted a screening of the director’s cut of Watchmen that will be preceded by a discussion from representatives of DC Comics on the new Watchmen prequel comic series. Oddly enough, there will also be a live reading of an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, which does nothing if not demonstrate the festival’s breadth.
Both school administrators and the Times have committed to having the festival at USC’s University Park Campus for an indefinite period of time.
All these actions require funding, and though neither Orliss nor the university were able to comment on the specifics of the festival’s finances, it’s safe to assume that the festival represents a hefty investment for USC.
Austin Vogel, a sophomore majoring in computer science, believes it’s all worth it.
“[The Festival of Books] attracts a lot of public attention to the university, which is obviously beneficial, and it also shows our commitment to giving back to the community in the form of a great event,” Vogel said. “It also helps independent vendors and authors to show their work.”
Jeremy Slap, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and neuroscience, put it more simply: “It’s festive, and there are a ton of books. It’s a lot of fun.”
No one is quite sure what form books and literature will take in the coming years, but this doesn’t seem to faze the festival’s coordinators. John Conroy, a spokesperson for the event, said the festival looks to address the rise of the literary journal, including the Los Angeles Review of Books, and to judiciously adapt to the dynamic development of new media.
Perhaps most telling, the Times includes a curious question on its Festival of Books “Attendee FAQ”:
“Will the festival still be a celebration of the written word?”
The answer?
“Yes. Now and always.”
Ok so this is a nice article and all, but I cannot believe that no where in this article does it say  when the festival is happening!
Sure, you hyperlink to the festival website, but that’s kinda lazy guys, c’mon…
Btw, it’s this weekend, from 10 am to like 6 pm each day.

Do you ever feel like teaching gets in the way of your writing/research or vice versa?
AIMEE BENDER: The balance is tricky. Reading time gets scarce, and summer is crucial that way. I write in the mornings, which helps, because by the time I’m teaching, that part of my day has already happened.
FELIX GUTIERREZ: I think writing informs my teaching. It keeps me rethinking. The students are very helpful, [their] generation gives newer insights. I think my writing is better because I am teaching.
OLIVER MAYER: Teaching informs and fuels my writing research. Interacting with young people keeps me young. But occasionally I have something burning in me that I can’t wait to write at the same time that I’m grading or teaching or prepping for a class. When that happens, I try to take a deep breath and try not to get frustrated. The truth is there is time for everything to get done, teaching and writing, even when it doesn’t feel like it.
Where do you do your writing?
T.C. BOYLE: Both at home and in a place I rent in the Sequoia National Forest. When I’m in the Sequoias I get more writing and reading done than I do down here in Santa Barbara, simply because of the boredom factor. I find that crushing boredom is highly productive.
MIKE GRUNTMAN: All writing I can only do at home because when I get to campus, my door is open and students come in nonstop with all kinds of issues, problems, challenges, requests. Staying at home helps to concentrate. On campus, it’s practically impossible.
MAYER: I like to write in my office on campus. I play my music and work on several things at the same time — a new play, a report for the provost, notes for a writing student — and I like to keep the door open. I actually don’t mind being interrupted. It’s fun to hear other people working and laughing, students, staff, and other faculty. Sometime it finds its way into my work.
Aimee Bender is a professor of English in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences
Are other faculty members involved in your writing process?
BENDER: Not in the process, no. But it is nice when we touch base about what we’re working on. A sense of community helps with writers, or at least it helps me.
GUTIERREZ: I’ve done five books, all of them have been co-authored. Everyone has their own style. We sketch out the book as to what you want it to be, and then we divide the chapters and then we read each other’s chapters. You’re not all trying to write a sentence at the same time. You have to have respect for the person you’re working with.
MAYER: Although I write alone, I have several wonderful friends and collaborators on campus, most recently my colleague Angus Fletcher. … There are so many brilliant people on campus that it’s only natural to work together in one way or another.
Where do you find inspiration?
GUTIERREZ: There’s a curiosity that I think any journalist has, wondering ‘what if,’ ‘how come,’ ‘if I looked here, what would I find,’ and so a lot of it is driven by your own interests and looking for stories in places where people may have not seen them or found them before. … It takes a lot of digging.
GRUNTMAN: I always use the first lecture [of my classes] to talk about historical developments of rocketry, and I realized there are no books that would serve engineering or scientist audiences. The books [in existence] were either popular, so they had very little technical information, or they were narrow books that were just too narrow. Nothing existed that was technical enough but also very broad so I decided I wanted this book, and I heard from other colleagues that they wanted a book like this.
Oliver Mayer is an associate professor of dramatic writing at the USC School of Theatre.
MAYER: It’s great to live in L.A. because there are so many stories all around us occurring every day; it’s pretty impossible to run out of ideas. I believe that the best writing asks big questions, sometimes unanswerable questions, and that in trying to answer them we can do our best stuff. I also think the injustice spurs good writing; sadly, there’s a lot of injustice.
SUSAN ESTRICH: Everywhere and nowhere. And often, not quickly enough. Mostly they come from reading and thinking and not thinking.
What’s the hardest part of the writing and publishing processes?
BOYLE: The middle of any book. The middle is where you hit the wall. Touring is tough too, simply because you must address the horrors of the airline industry and eat hotel food. Take any reasonably healthy man or woman, expose him or her to hotel dining for a week, and death will rapidly ensue.
GRUNTMAN: It takes time. We have only 24 hours in a day, and a lot of other competing demands. I work in a highly competitive field in which it’s very difficult to get grants and contacts. It takes a lot of

effort. We also want to provide our students the best education programs. The little amount of time that remains goes into writing, so if I have more time, I have two or three books on the back burner in various stages. It may take a couple or years or it may take forever — it’s all a matter of time.
ESTRICH: Book tours.
Do you have any idiosyncratic writing habits?
BOYLE: Not at all. I simply bleed a chicken into a dishpan, immerse my feet and begin typing. When the blood goes cold, I stop writing.
BENDER: I write for two hours in the morning, often to the minute. Because I’m ready to stop! And I think routine has value here.
MAYER: I have toys on my office desk that I like to play with when I’m stuck. I also like to have my dog Don Aldo in the office when I’m writing; he’s an amazing companion.

The pair will discuss the sometimes painful nighttime ritual as described in their book, Go The F**k To Sleep. The New York Times hailed the best-seller “a new bible for weary parents,” but beware: This lighthearted take on parenting might not be suitable for young children.

E Cannabis Unum (Panel 1115)
Saturday, 4:30 p.m., Taper Hall 101
The Los Angeles Times’ own Dean Kuipers moderates a discussion of the shifting narrative that has shaped the representations of and discourses about marijuana in America. Considering its history of criminalization, it’s no great surprise that much of the writing emerging about pot frames its use as an outlaw act, but that flat representation is complicated by its medicinal applications, its Hollywood heyday (Pineapple Express, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle) and the fresh wave of activist support that it seems to receive from every generation.
America’s Granny
Betty White Interviewed by Karen Grigsby Bates
Sunday, 1:20 p.m., Los Angeles Times Stage
Besides her love for acting and television, Betty White’s other passion is animals. The Golden Girls and Hot in Cleveland actress will speak Sunday about her love for all kinds of animals including her Golden Retriever, Pontiac. White’s greatest devotion just might be the creatures at the Los Angeles Zoo since, after advocating for many of the zoo’s exhibits, Los Angeles has named White “Ambassador to the Animals.” Her appearance is a must-see for pet lovers.

Most people know Bethenny Frankel as the Bravo reality star who never shies away from a catfight on The Real Housewives of New York. She even televised her wedding to Jason Hoppy on Bethenny Ever After. Many more are familiar with her wide variety of SkinnyGirl cocktails, which sold for more than $100 million last year.
One thing not usually associated with the wise but vulnerable Frankel is a writing habit, but the 41-year-old is a successful author. Her three books, Naturally Thin, The SkinnyGirl Dish and A Place of Yes, have all been on The New York Times Best-Seller List for as long as 18 weeks.
This weekend, Frankel will join talk show hosts, reality stars and actors to discuss their latest literary endeavors at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
In a period when the publishing business is in near-constant flux, there seem to be only two certainties in the ever-shifting industry: Hollywood’s rich and famous love writing books in every genre, and consumers can’t stop reading them.
Need a book to read to your children before bedtime? Mary Poppins herself, The Sound of Music actress Julie Andrews, has just released a short story called The Very Fairy Princess: Here Comes the Flower Girl, which Andrews will read Sunday.
Molly Shannon, the same woman who played Catholic school student Mary Katherine Gallagher on Saturday Night Live, has chosen to write for children with her book Tilly the Trickster, which she will also read Saturday.
Other celebrities are taking advantage of their role in pop culture to sell books.
Known for her judging skills on Top Chef, Gail Simmons has chosen to step out of the kitchen to write her memoir Talking With My Mouth Full.
Tori Spelling thinks she can advise you on hosting parties with her fifth book CelebraTORI: Unleashing Your Inner Party Planner to Entertain Friends and Family.
And, Cheryl Burke wants to share her story on how Dancing With The Stars changed her life with her memoir Dancing Lessons: How I Found Passion and Potential on the Dance Floor and in Life.
Some might argue that many of these authors should stick to their day job and don’t deserve to have their name appear on the cover of a book, an achievement that can take years — if it happens at all — for smaller-name writers to reach. In addition, all these books will likely receive prime locations at your favorite bookstore while lesser-known authors will be pushed aside.
The reality is that most celebrities have an established brand as well as a platform — a reality show or magazine coverage, for instance — to reach potential readers that other authors don’t have. Celebrity-penned books tend to create buzz and, as a result, sell.
Fans fell in love with Frankel’s life story beginning with The Real Housewives. An unmarried woman struggling to pay rent and barely communicating with her family became a business success overnight, found love and started a family with the birth of her baby girl, Bryn. The star opened up to the cameras, and her story resonated with many viewers. As a result, fans wanted more; they got it with her books.
Through Facebook, Twitter and talk shows, Frankel has been able to reach even more consumers and sell hundreds of thousands of books. The same fan base that made her first three books best-sellers will also likely be curious to read her new novel SkinnyDipping.
Frankel isn’t the only star to find success through writing. Tina Fey, Rob Lowe, Chelsea Handler, Betty White and Steven Tyler have all written best-selling books that give readers a fresh perspective on their favorite celebrity.
Not every celebrity with authorial aspirations, however, has met with success. Jersey Shore stars Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino experienced meager sales along with Real Housewives Jill Zarin and NeNe Leakes.
Releases from mother of eight Kate Gosselin and The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg also failed to garner significant attention from readers.
In a 24/7 celebrity gossip culture however, fans feel a stronger connection to their favorite celebrities than ever before. Between an entertaining morning interview with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Today, to an exclusive book excerpt in People Magazine, to an in-person signing event at the Grove, it has never been easier for celebrities to share their projects with the masses. For consumers, connecting and communicating with the authors isn’t too difficult either — particularly in urban centers like Los Angeles.
Just wait until this summer. Andy Cohen, Ryan O’Neal, Billy Bob Thorton and Joan Rivers all have planned to release new titles, just in time to be carried along as beach reading. You can count on most — if not all — of these stars to add “best-selling author” to their résumé in no time at all.

The forward march of societal progress is bound to meet with some dissent, particularly where technology is concerned.
The sudden surge in the prevalence of e-books is no exception. Young and old alike have found fault with the burgeoning literary medium, lamenting the loss of intimacy granted by the tangible form, the growing presence of electronic devices in the classroom and the disappearance of big-box booksellers like Borders and neighborhood bookshops alike that have recognized their time is up and bowed out of the business.
In our panic, it seems we have forgotten that e-books, while fundamentally different, are not fundamentally bad. On the contrary, they represent a positive cultural evolution, a necessary adaptation to the rapidly changing needs of 21st-century life.
It’s as if we’ve been given wings, and one particularly vocal segment of the population is too afraid to fly. Thus, they remain on the ground with resources growing scarce, while the rest of us delve eagerly into the new land of plenty — plentiful reading, that is.
Already, we live in a society where the world is at our fingertips. Music, photos and reference materials are all readily accessible, while instantaneously contacting anyone with whom we’ve ever networked can be achieved in a single well-spent minute on the Internet.
As USC students, we’re almost expected to have some sort of electronic database on our person at all times. For instance, it’s not out of the ordinary for a professor to request that a student look up the dictionary definition of a word on his or her smartphone while in class.
To have e-books become equally commonplace is to complete the long overdue task of bringing literature up to speed with the rest of the world. Their efficiency and convenience is undeniable. Suddenly an entire library can be contained with a pocket-size device that weighs less than one paperback book and can be whipped out on the subway, during a coffee break or in line at the bank.
In an age where technology threatens to permanently distract people from literature altogether, the value of a piece of technology that could actually integrate reading into tech-dependent lifestyles cannot be ignored. This applies to cost as well, as e-books have made reading more affordable in some cases — though the price of the e-readers themselves often provide a significant barrier for many would-be users. Digital content is infinitely cheaper to produce than traditional books, as well as cheaper to store, market and distribute. This has proven particularly beneficial for college students, for whom the daunting cost of textbooks is just one of many financial burdens.
E-books also offer multiple features that enhance the reading experience itself, such as search functions and direct links to dictionaries and other reference material. Readers of e-books have the benefit of immediately available resources should they come across an unfamiliar Spanish phrase in work, or the need to hunt down a particular quote in a mammoth-size novel like War and Peace.
Meanwhile, many of the legitimate complaints raised by e-books are only temporary issues that can be easily resolved in the near future. Annotation difficulties are an example of one such lingering problem, but manufacturers of wireless reading devices have already designed applications for note-taking. Refinement of these kinds of applications will happen naturally as e-books become more widely used.
The lack of an effective lending system is another commonly cited issue. But again, libraries worldwide are already taking steps to digitize their collections. Once the transition is completed on a larger scale, the burden on libraries will be eased enormously. No longer will they have to worry about the upkeep of massive collections of bulky, decaying material.
E-books will also prevent the further production of more of this material, saving countless numbers of trees and doing our environment a huge favor at a time when it can use all the help it can get.
True, e-books can be hard to stomach for millions of die-hard bibliophiles, but they, nonetheless, remain the logical, efficient and cost-effective successor to their physical counterparts.
People complained when computers phased out typewriters, too. You would have to search far and wide, however, to find a person who takes issue with today’s word processing software. The transition will take getting used to, as does any significant cultural shift.
In the meantime, it’s not as if books are being burned. In fact, the opposite is occurring: Books are being reinvigorated, given a new chance to take hold in a society that once threatened to no longer have room for them.

In today’s era of advanced technology, it seems that no matter where USC students go, electronic readers are everywhere. Kindles, Nooks, iPads and even smartphones — all of these devices give students the power to instantly download books, typically for discounted prices. So, physical books are relics of the past, right? Wrong.
“My love for books is boundless,” said Brittany Valiza, a senior majoring in communication. “I’m not into the whole ‘e-book’ thing at all. It’s a pleasure going to Barnes & Noble and buying real books instead of reading everything digitally.”

Genevieve Wijangco, also a senior majoring in communication, said nothing replaces paperback books. “It’s the experience of touching it, the fact that it’s tangible,” she said. “I love to read for pleasure and with paperback books, I see no need to buy them digitally.”
According to a statewide study conducted by USC Dornsife and the Los Angeles Times, the number of Californians who own e-readers has increased since last year. Eighty-six percent of Californians who own e-readers, however, said they also read hardbound and paperback books. Additionally, 54 percent of Californians who own e-readers said they read books in print most of the time.
“It hurts my eyes!” said Emily Heckelman, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism. “I use my MacBook for everything, so when I read paperback books, it gives me a break from the screen’s glare and allows be to me more comfortable,” Heckelman said.
The poll also cited an increase in pleasure reading among Californians. Out of the study’s pool of 1,500 Californian voters, approximately four in five said they have read at least one book for pleasure in the last month. Jeremy Klif, a senior majoring in business administration, said he could not remember the last time he read for pleasure.
“I don’t like e-books. Actually, I don’t like any kind of book,” Klif said. “I never enjoyed the reading process and in the rare case that there is a book that I really want to read, I usually don’t have time to read it because of all the stuff I already have to read for school.”
When it comes to print editions holding their own against their electronic counterparts, academic reading is a different story. Most of the students interviewed for this article preferred to access scholarly sources and other research material online because of its convenience. This has not, however, kept students from visiting USC’s many libraries.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
According to Hugh McHarg, the associate dean of planning and communication, USC Libraries has seen a 40 percent increase in attendance from 2006 to fall 2010, and that increase has continued into 2012. More than 215,000 people visit USC Libraries each year.
“A big issue is space,” McHarg said. “We often have to find ways to accommodate an increasing number of students who want not just a quiet space to study, but also collaborative space to work together on group projects.”
McHarg said the influx of library users prompted USC Libraries to extend hours for the Von KleinSmid Center Library and the Crocker Business Library during finals.
“Although we offer a wealth of resources online, students tell us that they love interacting face-to-face with librarians who can help them find administrative, scholarly and valuable sources,” McHarg said. “It’s not like Google where you’re on your own.”
USC Libraries also re-opened the Los Angeles Times reference desk at Doheny Memorial Library to accommodate more students.
Jared Ginsburg, a junior majoring in political science, said the increasing number of students who use the libraries causes him to steer clear of Club Leavey.
“I do it all at home,” Ginsburg said. “I try to make use of the library’s electronic resources and I’ll download textbooks if I can. Anything to avoid the overcrowded libraries.”

Books are all about learning and escaping to alternate realities — past or future, real or imaginary, possible or impossible. So what do the books that we are reading say about the state of our reality? More importantly, what do they say about us?
Best-sellers lists, in a way, could be reflections of the national mood or the mindset of a certain period. They clearly represent some of the most popular books of the time, but certainly not all. Many would say that the Nora Robertses and Danielle Steels of the world are best-sellers, but not literary greats. There is a difference.
What seems to be eternally popular are exactly those kinds of fiction novels, in which thrill, murder, intrigue, love and drama dominate the pages. These might be referred to as the junk food of the book world, but everyone needs a little indulgence every once in a while.
No matter the era, historical novels will also always be a literary staple. We seem to nurture an abiding obsession with returning to the past and escaping our present, no matter if it is leaving the 1960s for the Italian Renaissance — as readers apparently did in droves with Irving Stone’s The Agony and the Ecstasy — or forgetting 2012 for the era of Vincent van Gogh in Sacré Bleu. We continually return to our pasts, determined to re-explore and re-appreciate.
How much can one really say, however, about the significance of a list of books that is somewhat arbitrarily created — The New York Times has a secret formula used to derive their best-sellers lists, and not even the Book Review staff know how it fully operates — and is driven by so many uncorrelated factors? There are so many books, so many genres, so many different kinds of tastes and people that it becomes more conjecture than accurate analysis.
It is interesting to think about best-sellers as a representation of the culture and people of a certain time. One hundred years from now, social scientists might look at The New York Times’ 2012 Best-sellers List to gain insight into what we and our world were like. Though it might give clues, it will never give the whole picture.
The New York Times Best-Sellers List: A Glorified Sales Report, or  a Snapshot of Shifting Literary Tastes?
50 years ago… 1962

2. The Bull from the Sea, Mary Renault
3. The Fox in the Attic, Richard Hughes
4. The Agony and the Ecstasy,Irving Stone
5. Ship of Fools, Katherine Anne Porter
April 22, 1962: Just as hippiedom and the civil rights movement were beginning to sweep through America, 1962’s best-selling fiction made a return to magical eras of the past — to early 20th-century New York in J.D. Salinger’s Franny and Zooey to classical Athens in Mary Renault’s The Bull From the Sea to the Italian Renaissance via Irving Stone’s pseudo-biographical novel about Michelangelo, The Agony and the Ecstasy. But the list also reflects the darker times lurking beneath the magic, through the personal predicaments of a boy coming of age after World War I in Richard Hughes’ The Fox in the Attic.
25 years ago… 1987
1. Fine Things,Danielle Steel
2. Windmills of the Gods, Sidney  Sheldon

April 19, 1987: Two authors who are still household names today graced the top five fiction best-sellers in 1987, Danielle Steel and Stephen King.

The only authors not sold in your local grocery store? Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus, co-authors of The Nanny Diaries, a satirical take on the culture of the rich and powerful in New York City through the eyes of a nanny in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.
