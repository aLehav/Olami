RegistHer is a new nonprofit organization founded at USC to increase voter registration among female college students, with an emphasis on those in sororities. 
Now a week before the midterm elections, several hundred more students are registered to vote through RegistHer’s efforts, according to founder Elise Burger. 
The nonpartisan organization implemented a competition among USC sororities in early October to encourage members to register to vote. 
The efforts yielded around 200 registrations. 
“A lot of young people don’t vote because it doesn’t feel like something that’s even really your right [since you’re just coming of age], and it’s not something you’re encouraged to do,” Burger said. “Maybe this will lead to more discussion.”
The idea came to Burger, a junior majoring in communication, in late September, around the time of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. Within days, Burger created RegistHer, and spent her summer paycheck on trademarking the name. She then created social media accounts and a website for the organization.
A member of the Alpha Phi Sorority, Burger said that sororities presented a perfect outlet to increase political participation. According to Burger, sororities are a viable place to start with since these communities are an easy way to find a large group of women in the same place. 
“To get a group of young women, who have these ideals about sisterhood and about including women and about bettering each other … that’s the kind of group that I need to make sure [is] voting,” Burger said.
Burger hopes that her competition will lead to more political involvement. She said under RegistHer, each house competes against each other to get the highest percentage of their members to vote. The USC Panhellenic Council is still compiling results, but a winner and prize will be announced near Nov. 6.
The USC Panhellenic Council was excited about the idea, according to Alpha Phi’s junior delegate Nicole Klein. Originally, the sororities were only going to participate in VoteSC, a competition between USC and UCLA to see which school can register the most voters. However, the council was interested in Burger’s more focused approach.
Klein said she had never seen something like RegistHer before, and sees the council continuing to use the competition in the future.
“Everyone was super happy to get involved and talk to their friends about it,” she said. 
Two weeks ago, motivote, a platform looking to increase voter turnout, partnered with RegistHer for the midterms and future elections. 
“Motivote does the actual encouraging young individuals to vote. They kind of take over step two of this process,” Burger said. “We got to connect and we decided we were going to collaborate for the 2018 midterms.”
While motivote focuses on getting registered voters to the polls, the groups’ premises are similar — focusing on positive peer pressure to encourage young people to be politically involved.
“The fact that RegistHer was already thinking in a very similar way [about how] we can get a lot of young people to take the step of registering to vote by making it [into] a competition is really aligned to what we’re doing,” said Jess Riegel, co-founder and CEO of motivote.
Motivote has been assisting Burger with reaching out to local businesses and companies in the South Los Angeles area to help contribute, as well as how to reach out to other student group leaders, Riegel said.
While the partnership is currently in its trial phase, Burger wants to continue to work with Motivote in the future. She also hopes to expand RegistHer to other states and colleges across the country. 
“I think that if we get enough traction for this year’s election, that by 2020 we’ll be able to make a really big difference,” Burger said.

American studies professor Juan De Lara has researched the economy’s impact on Southern California communities outside L.A. since the early 2000s. (Kevin Lu | Daily Trojan)
As the son of immigrants, American studies professor Juan De Lara started picking fruit when he was four years old to earn money. 
Wages were low and the work was difficult, but the experience helped him realize the importance of education.
This year, De Lara published his book “Inland Shift: Race, Space, and Capital in Southern California,” which was developed in conjunction with the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. 
De Lara’s book is a conversation about  new ways to examine how economic issues impact local communities, similar to the one he grew up in. He will speak on a panel for his new book on Nov. 13. 
“[The book] is thinking about Southern California and about the process of globalization and what that meant for the racial and class politics of Southern California as a region,” De Lara said. “I look at things like the ports and the expansion of the logistics industry and what that did to jobs.”
De Lara said he started researching this topic in the early 2000s because he wanted to learn more about Southern California outside of Los Angeles However, he faced difficulties during the process because of the limited research conducted in the areas around the Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
To ameliorate the gap in literature, De Lara said he believed it was appropriate to publish his book now, to further educate the audience.
“Nobody was really writing about the area and what was going on and from an academic perspective,” De Lara said. “I thought it was time that somebody published a book that’s specifically focused on the region.”
De Lara said that since the 1990s, the Inland Empire experienced an economic shift that drastically changed the demographic makeup and landscape. When he tried to conduct further research, De Lara discovered a lack of related academic studies. 
“There has been a tendency to think of the drama of social movement mobilization playing out in our major cities like Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco,” Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
According to Pastor, the economic growth in the region was influenced by what was happening in the Inland Empire.
“We wouldn’t have L.A. and Long Beach emerge as the biggest ports in the country without the kinds of warehousing facilities that have grown in Riverside and San Bernardino counties,” De Lara said.
De Lara also noted that the two counties were the fastest growing part of California, with one of the largest concentrations of Latinx and immigrant population.
The book takes a look at how logistics shaped the demographic and regional makeup of Southern California. It also examines the pockets of resistance in fighting against economic and social disparity in the region.
“The other thing is the emergence of a new kind of political class of [a] very young population that is beginning to now assert themselves in terms of becoming involved in politics,” De Lara said. “It’s been a rich environment to understand how the politics of race and class and culture have taken hold in the region.”
De Lara’s research has given the Inland Empire greater exposure by opening a door for different groups to understand and better serve the region. 
“He has been able to bring this research into the public sphere to influence how policy makers, community based organizations, and funders view global trade and its local level impacts,” sociology professor Jody Vallejo said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Much of De Lara’s research directly showcases the Latinx community and issues related to their communities. As a Latinx academic, he finds creating conversations about his history helps Latinx students at USC feel more comfortable. 
“I talk about my own history in order to make sure that students … understand that they can come talk to me or I can sort of provide some mentorship,” De Lara said. “And I think I’ve benefited from that.”

Founder Rina Ritivoiu (back left), Irena Preda (front left), and over 20 of their peers are planning a concert on Skid Row, as part of their new volunteer music performance group. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
Students from the Thornton School of Music filled the streets of Koreatown with song as they performed for community members in line at a food pantry Saturday morning. 
A few hours later, the group sang again for patients at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Each time, they performed a variety of songs from operas to classics like “Over the Rainbow” and were met with smiling audiences, who danced and sang along. 
“I saw the power of music and what it does,” said Rina Ritivoiu, a doctoral student studying musical arts in sacred music who founded the group. “[It] brings hope, vitality, people feel enlightened. Their heart is light. Their body feels light. They feel like they are transformed somewhere.”
Ritivoiu was inspired to form  the volunteer group in one of her graduate courses this semester, when her professor, Dana Gioia, assigned students to either present about an existing organization or imagine their own. Ritivoiu hoped to bring her idea to life and  approached Gioia, who suggested that Ritivoiu’s group host concerts for the community. 
She recruited over 20 friends and peers to join the project, and planned their first concert. 
“All students ask for advice,” Gioia said. “What’s different about Rina is that about a month later, she was already doing things. To me, that’s a sign of somebody who is going to be successful.”
Irena Preda, a graduate student studying music performance, was the first friend asked to join the group. Preda was interested in the project because it helps bring live performances to those who don’t typically experience them.
“There’s a certain segment of the population that tends to be the target audience and tends to go to concerts, be it classical music concerts or rock or pop or jazz concerts,” Preda said. “A lot of the underserved communities cannot afford to provide instruments for their children, so there’s a whole segment of society that never gets exposed to live music.”
Ritivoiu is  working to plan future concerts throughout the surrounding communities, including Skid Row. She also said the group plans to return to the hospital to perform in the chemotherapy unit for patients undergoing treatment.
By performing for these communities, Ritivoiu hopes the group can help people relax and escape from their problems.
“I want them to have this opportunity because they are already going through so much,” Ritivoiu said. “Music can [help] to bring them out of their circumstances for a few minutes or maybe 30 minutes, that they feel like they’re appreciated, they’re acknowledged.”
Through the research she has done in some of her classes, Ritivoiu learned about the positive impacts of music, both mental and physical. Still, she said musicians don’t always take part in philanthropic events because they struggle financially.
Ritivoiu said she hopes that the organization will create careers for philanthropic musicians, so they can help underserved communities without worrying about financial insecurity.
“We are doing as much important work as medical professionals, [and] we know that they are known for being rich,” Ritivoiu said. “I feel like musicians also need that support, and they deserve good recognition, and they shouldn’t be constantly known to be struggling musicians. My project and organization is to give them careers where they can do what they love but have supporters as well.”

California’s Proposition 12 concerns the treatment of animals in its farms. This proposition attempts to help farm animals live more peacefully, and voting yes supports the initiative to establish minimum space requirements based on square feet for calves raised for veal, breeding pigs and egg-laying hens. The prop will also ban the sale of animal products from farms that do not comply with the requirements. Violations of the standard will result in a misdemeanor and up to a $1,000 fine.
A no on Prop 12 would keep the current minimum space requirements for farms. These requirements are based on animal movement rather than square feet. A no vote would continue to ban certain animal products that come from farms where animals are confined to areas deemed too small based on current standards, and not make them any stricter than they are currently. Californians should vote yes on this proposition to ensure a change in animal standards, resulting in a healthier and safer environment for farm animals that prioritizes their need for space. 
It seems reasonable to vote to pass a proposition that helps animals in the farming industry, especially because the animals are so poorly treated. However, this is not the first time an initiative of this nature has been on California’s ballot. In 2008, the Humane Society put forth Proposition 2, which called to ban the confinement of pregnant pigs, calves raised for veal and egg-laying hens. While the term “confinement” is very generous, the 2008 proposition called to relieve animals from inhumane environments and ensure that they have room to stand up, lie down, turn around and fully extend their limbs. 
Despite backlash from several opponents — including the Association of California Egg Farmers, who claimed the proposition was much too vague because it did not provide exact numbers for how much space an animal should have — the proposition passed, and was finally enacted in 2015.
Prop 2 set movement standards, but did not explicitly ban the sale of veal from calves, pork from breeding pigs and eggs from hens. That is the key difference between Prop 12 and Prop 2, which would prohibit the confinement of these animals in spaces below a certain number of square feet. This would not only provide opponents with numbers, but also place more responsibility on the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the California Department of Public Health to actually enforce these laws, or else the responsibility is theirs.
Prop 12 places more accountability on these departments, and makes animal treatment standards easier to enforce by establishing a strict number with zero exceptions. Prop 2 also did not authorize a department to oversee the newly added rule, leaving local law enforcement in charge. To be frank, police are not frequently visiting farms and enforcing these laws due to various other crimes that need to be handled, rendering Prop 2 almost useless.
The Association of California Egg Farmers and National Pork Producers Council are against Prop 12 because it would be cost more for them to provide proper housing for these animals. However, the Humane Society is not backing down, and continues to fund this campaign with the help of Prevent Cruelty California, a ballot measure committee which has raised $12.8 million. 
Josh Balk, vice president of the Humane Society, described this ballot initiative as the “the most transformational step forward of all-time in regards to animal protections.” These groups all support this proposition because it benefits the animals, while opponents do not believe in prioritizing the animals they are slaughtering.
Animals deserve to be treated fairly, even if they are being raised for food. It is inhumane and cruel to restrict animals to the horrid conditions of factory farms and even more unfortunate that companies are only concerned with money, regardless of the cost these animals have to pay. Prop 2 was a great start, but Prop 12 can greatly improve a farm animal’s life, which in itself is enough reason to vote yes.

Although none of the 11 propositions on California’s 2018 ballot explicitly deal with education, many of them affect student and teacher populations in the state. For this week’s column, I’ve laid out a voter guide for how you can vote on those measures.
Four of the initiatives on this year’s ballot aim to improve housing in California. Housing plays a large role in how schools function — property taxes provide the second largest share of California’s educational funding. This means that people who can afford to live in more expensive neighborhoods send their children to better schools;  because these high-income households are paying more property taxes, their respective school districts can spend more money on each student. 
The disparities between school districts can be quite stark. For example, the Beverly Hills Unified School District spends $16,365 on each student. But just 50 miles north, the Mesa Union School District spends $9,421 on each student. There’s an easy fix to this issue: Money used for education from property taxes should be pooled at the state level and redistributed according to need. 
Proposition 1 would authorize $4 billion to aid vulnerable populations such as veterans and low-income families in finding affordable housing in notoriously high-cost areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco. This would help level the playing field for children. 
If Prop 1 passes, kids will be able to attend school in neighborhoods where more is spent on each student, without their parents having to pay high rent. While it doesn’t solve the root issue at the intersection of housing and education, it does alleviate it and address the housing crisis. 
Proposition 2 focuses on aid to homeless individuals by using money currently allocated to general funding for mental health services to providing housing, specifically for homeless individuals with mental illnesses. 
California is home to 23 percent of the nation’s homeless children — over 300,000 kids. It is well documented that children with insecure housing suffer in school, as they are focused on survival. 
Furthermore, mental illnesses affect people of all ages, including children and teenagers, and experiencing homelessness can often only exacerbate that. Getting them into safe housing, as Prop 2 attempts to do, would allow them to focus on their education, and recieve aid for mental health treatment. 
Let’s take a quick break from housing to talk about Proposition 4, the only ballot initiative that focuses specifically on children. If passed, Prop 4 would give $1.5 billion to California children’s hospitals and other pediatric medical services throughout the state. 
The hospitals this bill would benefit are nonprofit institutions that provide affordable and highly specialized pediatric care. A major part of education goes beyond simply teaching in the classroom. Teachers can often be a child’s primary support system outside of their family, and maintaining healthy students in the classroom not only allows the children to put their full energy into learning but also ensures that they’re in the classroom on a daily basis. Prop 4 would keep children out of hospitals, and thereby help them in the classroom. 
Proposition 5’s language suggests it would help the severely disabled and elderly people pay for housing by allowing them to maintain their home’s property tax rate. While this helps them marginally, it has larger implications for funding for local services, including public schools. Remember how property taxes determine how much a school district pays per student? Prop 5’s passage would lower the amount of property tax revenue schools receive, essentially moving funding from education to housing. 
While housing is a pressing issue in California, we cannot take funding from education to solve it, especially because three other housing measures are already on this year’s ballot. 
Finally, Proposition 10 aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, an outdated statewide law that prevents cities and local governments from enacting rent control measures for houses built after 1995 — or, in extreme cases, even earlier. In Los Angeles, rent control is prohibited on homes built after 1978 because of Costa-Hawkins. Prop 10 instead gives individual cities the opportunity to decide whether or not to implement rent control initiatives if they believe their city needs it rather than a blanket statewide measure like Costa-Hawkins. 
While rent control is more of a Band-Aid solution to California’s housing crisis, it’s still a fix that many California cities need right now. In the context of education, Prop 10 allows cities like Los Angeles to make housing more affordable, so children can live in districts where their needs are better met, and homeless children can focus on their educations.
California must make a lot of progress in how it runs its public schools, and it’s disheartening that there are no education initiatives on this year’s ballot. Keep in mind your vote will also have major implications on the state of California’s public education system.

The men’s volleyball team will have its work cut out as it begins the 2018-19 campaign with this weekend’s USC Fall Tournament at Galen Center. 
Play begins at 8:30 a.m. Saturday and continues until 4 p.m.
Though the games don’t count toward the team’s record, USC obviously still wants to perform at a high level. This will be difficult, however, since four of its seven potential opponents were ranked in the top 15 to end last season, including No. 1 Long Beach State and No. 2 UCLA. 
Eighth-ranked Pepperdine rounds out the top-10 participants, followed by No. 12 UC Santa Barbara and No. 13 Concordia Irvine. The Trojans will have easier matchups with Stanford, UC San Diego and Cal State Northridge.
Unlike most of its competitors, USC struggled last season, posting an 8-20 record and a 3-7 mark in conference play. Perhaps playing this tournament at home will be advantageous; the Trojans were 4-6 at Galen Center a season ago, but much better than their 2-11 road record. 
However, there is reason to be optimistic with this team, which returns its top-four leaders in kills, digs and assists. The team most notably includes redshirt senior outside hitter Jack Wyett, the team’s leader in kills and digs as well as the second-leading blocker. 
Wyett is crucial to every area of the game for the Trojans — he ranked in the team’s top five in the five major statistical categories — and will have to put his experience to great use as a team leader.
Another key returning piece is sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis, who is coming off a summer captaining the United States’ Junior National Team to fourth place in the NORCECA under-21 tournament. 
Lewis will be integral to the USC defense this season, as he easily led the Trojans in blocks last year with 87, and will impact the offense as one of the team’s top servers.
The team will have to replace last season’s assist leader in setter Gert Lisha. Head coach Jeff Nygaard will look to sophomore setter Chris Hall, who was second on the team in assists, to fill in the role.
Nygaard is entering his fourth season as the Trojans’ head coach, with a 29-53 career record. After the Trojans went 7-19 in his inaugural season, they showed promise with a 14-14 record in 2017. 
There are a few storylines to look out for this weekend. USC upset Pepperdine in the first round of last season’s MPSF Tournament before falling to top-seeded BYU in the next game. The Trojans also defeated UCLA in their final match of last year in a five-set epic on senior night.
However, that was the extent of USC’s success against the teams participating in this tournament. The Trojans went 4-8 against the teams involved, including a 2-0 record against Stanford. The games don’t really matter, but at the very least, the games will serve as a litmus test for the Trojans’ upcoming season.
The Trojans’ first regular season matchup is scheduled for Jan. 4 against Alberta.

After splitting their games over the weekend, the women’s volleyball team will travel to Oregon this weekend. 
No. 15 USC will play No. 16 Oregon on Friday and Oregon State on Sunday. The Trojans faced both teams in October earlier this season at Galen Center. While USC defeated Oregon State in three sets, it was swept by Oregon. 
“I think we’ll be more disciplined to start,” senior libero Victoria Garrick said. “Then I think in the Oregon game being able to adjust to what they’re showing us early and making quick adjustments.”
With a win, the Trojans will move ahead of Oregon in conference play, as both teams are 8-4 in Pac-12 play going into the game. Stanford leads the conference with a 12-0 record, but Washington State, USC and Oregon have the same record at 8-4.
“I think when second place has four losses, it’s not that big of a deal, but it’s kind of a pride thing,” Garrick said. “We have some of our rivalries with those girls, so we definitely want to beat them at their home because they beat us here.” 
The Ducks are led in hitting by senior outside hitter Lindsey Vander-Weide, who is averaging 3.45 kills per set. Sophomore outside hitter Maddie Goings leads Oregon State in kills with an average of 3.36 per game. 
The Trojans have strength on their offensive side when it comes to hitting, as sophomore and junior outside hitters Brooke Botkin and Khalia Lanier average 4.50 and 4.33 kills respectively per set in conference. Aside form statistics, the team has spent more time preparing for the mental battle.
“Oregon is going to have a lot of confidence because they beat us last time, so it’s going to be coming out early and shaking that confidence that they have,” Garrick said. “Oregon State is a team [that] we beat before pretty easily, but we can’t take that lightly.” 
Along with figuring out the mental game, the Trojans have studied footage and looked at stats. Having played both teams once before, they also have looked at their own game footage and figured out what areas need improvement. The last time the Trojans faced Oregon, they had 10 service errors and finished the game with a 54 percent side out percentage The Women of Troy know that these are areas to improve.
“We are trying to pass more balls in system on serve receive, so [Tuesday], that’s we did for an hour,” Garrick said. “Just in system serve receive, hoping to pass 60 percent in system and that will make everyone happy.” 
Oregon is the 15th-ranked opponent that USC will have to face this season, and the Trojans so far defeated eight of those ranked opponents. USC has won 53 of 66 matchups against Oregon overall.
After facing Oregon, the Trojans hope to add a couple wins to their record before returning home to take on both Washington schools. 
With Washington State holding the same conference record and a victory against them in their last meeting, the Trojans are looking to make this weekend count in preparation for next weekend.

In the wake of freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ return and the transfer of control over the offense from offensive coordinator Tee Martin to head coach Clay Helton, Wednesday’s practice was a calm affair for the Trojans as the team prepared to face Oregon State.
It was the second day of practice for offensive line coach Tim Drevno, and Helton said that the new coach is focusing on bringing a new emphasis on fundamentals. He also announced the introduction of graduate assistant Mike Goff as the new interim coach to fill out the staff ahead of Saturday’s game.
On an otherwise lowkey day of practice, one statement stood out — the seniors made a choice as a group to ignore the typical practice of  “No-Pads-November,” which previously meant spending the last month of the season without pads on during any practice sessions. 
In the past, this was done in an attempt to ease players through the final few weeks of the season without injuries, and to help players suffering from any nagging soreness or tweaks to fully recover without the risk of agitating something in practice. 
“They want a sense of urgency, to have a great November, and I commend them,” Helton said. “They want to leave their legacy. They want to show young people exactly how you treat a November and how you practice.”
This year, however, that won’t be an option, Helton said. The seniors decided that the team isn’t playing physical enough in games to earn the final month of rest in practice. 
Although there are only a handful of games left, he said that the seniors feel the team still lacks in physical play on both sides of the ball — the defense is struggling to wrap up tackles and make big plays, and the offense isn’t finding a way to power through hits and hard blocking up front.
The decision to forego “No-Pads-November” came after the return of key players, including Daniels and senior captain and linebacker Cam Smith. On the defensive side, Smith’s return has offered a sense of calm for a team that struggled to find its rhythm without the leader at its core in past weeks. 
At middle linebacker, Helton said, Smith has an ability to direct traffic that comes with experience, not just talent. 
While Helton acknowledged that freshman linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV was “phenomenal” in his ability to step up well in Smith’s absence, wrapping up five tackles against Arizona State, he believes that the return of a senior leader will make a difference in the at defense.
“It’s tough for anyone to sit on the sideline and watch but I had a lot of fun,” Smith said. “I got to see things from a different point and helped out some guys. We always talk about how you learn more when you teach, so I got to watch some guys and I think some guys made some huge strides.”
The defense in particular is continuing to be forced to make adjustments due to injuries, especially in the secondary. 
Senior safety Marvell Tell played teacher again on Wednesday as he worked with wide receiver Ajene Harris on repetitions at the safety spot. Tell has been forced to work in this mentorship role throughout the season, as the secondary rotated through losses due to suspensions, academic issues and injury. Helton pointed out that this is a key area that the senior and captain has been able to step up for his team.
Injury Report
Few changes were made to the injury report between Tuesday and Wednesday. Junior linebacker Jordan Iosefa suited up but remained out of practice after suffering an AC sprain. Linebacker John Houston is also limited after coming up gimpy with an ankle injury during team period on Tuesday.
Redshirt senior tight end Austin Applebee remains sidelined, along with sophomore wide receiver Randal Grimes. The defense is continuing to suffer the brunt of major injuries, with junior defensive linemen Connor Murphy and Caleb Tremblay remaining out of practice, along with sophomore linebacker Levi Jones and freshman defensive back Chase Williams. 
A total of 15 scholarship players are on the sidelines for the Trojans headed into Saturday’s game.

As scores of USC students trickled back to their homes after USC football’s home loss on Saturday, a single song echoed down Greek Row.
Normally, West 28th Street is filled with a hodgepodge of assorted bad rap music and old school rock being blasted from the speakers of every fraternity house (I did, in fact, hear “Mo Bamba” played simultaneously by two houses at one point on a Thursday afternoon). But the Row was quiet for once, except for the solemn notes of “Taps,” which eerily filled the air as dejected and hungover fans trudged back to their homes and cars.
The song choice was, of course, a sarcastic tribute to the USC football team, whose season now has been deemed as good as dead by the majority of Trojans. It was funny, I’ll give it that, but the song also highlighted for me the strangeness of the culture that surrounds USC athletics.
USC fans love to talk about their love of the Trojan Family. It’s our tagline, our mantra, our sense of pride. 
Trojans are supposed to be some of the best fans and alumni in the nation, forming some sort of mafia that obnoxiously backs our teams no matter what. 
And yet, we aren’t. Like it or not, USC fans are fickle. One minute, they’ll praise head coach Clay Helton for turning a program around; the next, they’ll rail against him. 
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels is in — until he throws an interception — and then he’s no good. Make a mistake, and you’ll lose this fanbase in a heartbeat.
Maybe it’s just my roots talking. 
In Lawrence, Kansas, basketball fans camp out for days for student section seats. I mean actual camping, with sleeping bags and everything, shuttling food and trading off spots so that students can make it to class without losing their spots in line. 
In Kansas City, fans still wear red and blue even when our teams are doing horribly. This year, the Royals were the worst team in baseball — literally, the actual worst team — and still filled over 70 percent of the stadium each game. 
USC fans lack that staying power. When the going is good, they don’t get all that excited. And when the going gets tough, the fans stay home. Trojans might be the best in the West at tailgating, but that isn’t the same as being good fans.
Take a look at the Penn State student section last Saturday, which was absolutely riotous as the team beat No. 19 Iowa. Even at its best, when former quarterback Sam Darnold was on his way up and a Rose Bowl was close in sight, I’ve never seen a version of USC football like that.
We don’t have a fanbase that can pull off a white out game, or that travels well on the road. We’re not the type of fans who would camp out for student section seats.
And the problem extends to every support. When I was a sophomore, I covered the water polo national championship in Berkeley, and the Cal student section was so raucous that security had to hold them back from jumping in the pool. 
When USC hosted last year, most of the student section stayed seated for the whole game.
Heck, we barely support our teams that routinely make bids for national championships: women’s soccer, beach volleyball and both water polo teams. Both of our basketball teams regularly play in front of scattered crowds whose cheers echo in the cavernous empty space of Galen Center. Less than 5,000 fans attended each basketball game last year, despite the team going 24-12 and making it into the second round of the NIT tournament.
Maybe we just win too much. I mean, honestly, it’s hard not to get a little jaded when your school wins multiple national championships every single year. We’ve been elite at football for so long that it’s hard to remember what it looks like to be a mediocre team, not to mention a bad one. 
I’m not saying that we grow complacent. USC is the best of the best, in football and in many other sports, and we should expect that caliber of talent and performance year in and out. But when our program stumbles, we can’t abandon ship. 
As a fandom, it’s time to embrace the bad years, to own them and to support our team wholeheartedly even when the wins don’t come.
But USC fans could do to learn some of the wisdom of any fan who has cheered for an absolutely abysmal program before — it might be a mediocre season, but it’s our mediocre season.

Las Tubas Trio, a tuba trio, took over Newman Recital Hall Tuesday night in a faculty recital hosted by the Thornton School of Music. The group comprises professors Jim Self, Norman Pearson and Doug Tornquist, all three of whom teach classical performance and composition for winds and percussion at the Thornton school. 
The evening also featured multi-instrumental performances from various guests, including  Self’s musical collaborator John Chiodini and the school’s entire tuba class. 
Las Tubas Trio opened the concert with Haydn’s “Tuba Trio Sonata,” a classic number. But by the third performance, no member of the tuba trio was onstage; instead, the USC Bass Tuba Quartet performed its rendition of Mozart’s “Allegro from Symphony 13.” 
Bass tuba player and Thornton graduate Beth Mitchell joked about the number’s transposition to tuba. 
“Of course it was originally written for this kind of ensemble, so you’re hearing it in its original form,” Mitchell said.
However, the program did not feature only classic or  historic pieces. Two of the 10 songs performed were original compositions by Self. Both made their live debut at the Thornton concert. The first song, aptly titled “Scrambles,” served as a fitting transition from classical numbers that came before it,  with an exhilarating and fast-paced, staccato tempo. 
“Like all of my music, [“Scrambles”] is a little unusual — it’s got some funny little patterns in it, and it’s rhythmically very challenging,” Self said.
Following the intermission was a much larger ensemble performance featuring student trumpet and French horn players. It was also led by Tornquist on the tuba and Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra trumpeter Tom Hooten. By “Signals,” it was evident that the show would be more than just jazz and tubas, with nuanced shifts in genre, tempo and rhythm at every turn.  
Tornquist spoke about  the growing number of performers onstage throughout the recital.
“You can see, it takes a little bit to put it together,” Tornquist said. 
The three-part original “Ludus” followed “Singles.”
Las Tubas Trio once again displayed the fluidity of the concert’s genre and instrumental style. Both featured only two performers Self on the tuba and Chiodini on guitar. In fact, Self composed “Brincadeiras,” the second duet between him and Chiodini. 
“I wrote [it] originally for the famous tuba player and Portuguese man Sérgio Carolino, and he asked me to write a piece for a solo tuba, saxophone quartet, and xylophone,” Self said. “So I wrote him … the piece and one of the movements was called ‘Brincadeiras,’ [which is] a Portuguese name meaning ‘fun song.’”
Two large-ensemble pieces soon followed with smaller ones. For this, Self, Chiodini and the entire USC tuba class performed “Straight No Chaser,” a jazz piece originally composed by Thelonious Monk. Then, to finish the concert, the tuba class and several graduates joined Las Tubas Trio on stage. The fast-paced classical piece “Moto Perpetuo” featured one of the most diverse arrays of instruments of the concert, complete with tubas, guitar and piano.
The faculty tuba recital gave students an opportunity to understand the musical limits of the tuba as well as the extraordinary range of the instrument.
“There’s not much music for three tuba people, and we’ve played about 90 percent of it tonight,” Self said.
