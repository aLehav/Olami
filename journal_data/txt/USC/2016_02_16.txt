The School for Cinematic Arts has created a partnership with the software company Jaunt VR, which provides virtual reality cameras for immersive cinematic experiences, to create the Jaunt Virtual Reality Incubator, which will be finalized this week. Students involved in the lab will develop virtual reality content and explore new storytelling techniques.
The virtual reality lab will be led by Professor Candace Reckinger, who specializes in hybrid media and got her start in animation for music videos, and will be housed on the third floor of the Interactive Media Building building in the SCA. Faculty members Eric Hanson, a VR professional who works for Jaunt, Mike Patterson, a visual music director and animator, and Alex McDowell, a production designer, will join Reckinger. In Reckinger’s lab, students will be able to collaborate with the Jaunt team to create their own virtual reality content.
As part of this collaboration, the faculty at SCA will be able to use Jaunt’s resources to provide internships to their students and participate in ongoing virtual reality research and development.
“We’re going to do focused research on what’s the new language for storytelling in VR,” Reckinger said.
So far, the lab has been funded for three years. Jaunt will loan the SCA two Jaunt One virtual reality cameras and playback technology during that time period. The first year will be an experiential learning phase, and the lab will offer seminars to get students acclimated to virtual reality technology. By the second and third year of the partnership, the film school hopes that classes will emerge.
Once the space has been partitioned in the SCI building, USC will hire full-time employees to staff the lab and offer technical assistance to students. The lab will be modeled off of Jaunt’s own lab in Santa Monica.
Jaunt has approached the film school with the hopes that they could use the Virtual Reality Incubator to help advance their experimental department.
“They are involved in narrative projects, experiential projects and experimental projects,” Reckinger said. “Jaunt looks at us as being the experimental arm.”
To find out how their cameras could be used for cinematic experiences, Jaunt looked to SCA. In January, Scott Fisher, the associate dean of research at SCA and Michael Fink, the Kortschak Family Endowed Division Chair in film and television production, began talking to Jaunt about the partnership.
“Jaunt was really eager to get a relationship going with the Cinema School,” Reckinger said.
The Jaunt Cinematic Virtual Reality Lab will add to existing research labs in the Cinematic Arts school, including Change Making Media, Experimental Audio Design and Transient Media. Jaunt will be the first lab to deal specifically with virtual reality. Furthermore, students will be able to use hardware that will not be available to the general public to determine how to use virtual reality to tell stories.
“Storytelling is the real challenge, and that’s the one everybody wants to do,” Reckinger said. “D.W. Griffith was the film director who basically started to figure out the language of the feature film, and we’re at a similar moment now.”
SCA students will be able to network and learn from executives in the technology sector. Jaunt VR brings in industry professionals with experience in prominent technology companies such as Apple, Intel and Lucasfilm.
Jaunt’s partnership with SCA comes as part of a push to prepare students for the changing media industry, in which virtual reality has become a reality.
“USC is really in a process of growth, and the VR lab is a big part of how they are moving into new media,” Reckinger said.

Team USA’s 2016 Olympics marathon times trials took place in Los Angeles on Saturday, with part of the course running through the USC campus.
The course began on the south side of downtown L.A., close to the Staples Center and L.A. Live. Competitors ran down Figueroa Street and onto campus, traveling down 34th Street and up Child’s Way by Tommy Trojan. Participants continued to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Exposition Park before returning Downtown.
Runners had to complete the six-mile Downtown to USC route four times, as well as doing a loop Downtown, totaling 26.2 miles.
There were barricades at the intersection of 34th and Trousdale and Childs Way and Trousdale in addition to part of Figueroa being blocked off, with CSC workers and DPS manning the course to ensure no one crossed while runners were passing.
“When people are on the track, they can’t come through – it’s a safety issue,” said a CSC worker.
Despite the Department of Transportation sending out emails on Jan. 27 and Feb. 12 informing students of the closures. Many students felt this was not ample notification.
Freshman Amy MacRae parked her car in PSX but was unaware that she would not be able to leave the parking structure between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
“We were supposed to be going to the USC Rugby game, and then because of my car lockdown, we couldn’t,” MacRae said. “So we thought we might as well just come over and watch, because this is a cool event to have on campus anyway.”
Despite being happy to watch the event, MacRae expressed frustration about the closures of the parking structures.
“I feel like they should have just had an exit route for people,” MacRae said. “They should have planned it better.”
Macrae also felt that email was not the optimal way for the University to communicate the street closures to students.
“I know there have been some emails and stuff, but do people really read them?” MacRae said. “I had no idea this was happening here — zero.”
Despite the importance of the event — the first three runners from the men and women’s races will compete in Rio this summer — there were not many USC students among the spectators.
“I expected a lot more people here, because this is the time trials for the Olympics, but it doesn’t seem too crowded,” said Tyler Matthews, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, who was watching the races.
Some students did not even realize the event was on at all. Marissa Di, a junior majoring in biochemistry, was planning to meet a friend when she was forced to wait for the runners to pass.
“I was just passing through, and they were like, ‘You can’t go through here,’ and I was like, ‘I don’t know what’s happening!’” Di said. “It would have been nice if I knew about it.”
Though there was limited student turnout, the Spirit of Troy, the Song Girls and members of the Spirit of Troy were present to cheer on the runners.
“It’s definitely exciting,” Matthews said. “I love hearing the band play too.”
Supporters of the time trials were aware of the significance of the event because of the amount of talented marathoners competing for three spots.
“It’s incredibly important; there are only three spots, and there’s a lot of talent out there,” said Eliza Peterson, who was on the USC marathon team for two years.
It was the hottest Olympic marathon time trials in history, with temperatures reaching 73 degrees during the race.
“It’s really hot today, and it’s not an easy run, but it looks like they’re going to try their best under the heat,” volunteer Sunny Pearson said.
Galen Rupp won the men’s race with a time of two hours, eleven minutes and eleven seconds, with Meb Keflezighi and Jared Ward also qualifying for Rio this summer.
Amy Cragg took the women’s title with a time of two hours, 28 minutes and 20 seconds, and Desiree Linden and Shalane Flanagan came in second and third, respectively.

Shea Rouda, a junior majoring in East Asian languages and culture, created Drops, a startup that rounds up people’s purchases to help them make small donations to their favorite charity.
Rouda came up with the business idea after observing the impact of his own spare change over time. Every month, he and his friends would allot a small fund toward various apartment activities. Their leftover cash came from tiny purchases such as a Starbucks coffee or a Subway cookie.
“I realized all sorts of businesses actually used the same practice,” Rouda said. “For example, Bank of America has Keep the Change, which helps people save money. It rounds up every purchase you make with your debit card to the next dollar, and the difference between that and the actual price gets moved to your savings account.”
Rouda also noticed the prevalence of placing loose bills in a tip jar or giving money to those in need. However, he hoped to take this concept one step further by translating it from a cash exchange to a credit or debit card exchange.
“I love the emphasis our society puts on donating money and giving back, but I wanted to create an online platform for it,” Rouda said. “With Drops, it’s essentially the same impact, but in a much more omnipresent way.”
Drops is planning to officially launch in the spring. The company is currently in Beta, with around 1,000 users on board for early access tests. Juniors Tristan Arthuad and Mikey Rovzar are both excited to try out the app and start donating.
“I’ve always wanted to give more to charity, but it never seemed like there was an easy way to do it,” said Arhuad, a business administration major.
Rovzar, who is majoring in narrative studies, agreed that finding time to donate is difficult.
“I’ll be honest — I don’t donate to causes often and lack important knowledge about local charities and the help they offer to those in need,” Rovzar said. “However, Drops makes it easy to donate while working around your financial budget, and it allows you to be philanthropically minded.”
Rouda’s hope is to inspire those who don’t normally donate to give to charities.
“Ideally, I want not only to see the donation market utilize Drops, but I also want to augment the donation market itself and make more donations happen in general,” Rouda said. “I hope Drops serves as an easier and more convenient way to do this.”
Looking into the future, Rouda’s long-term goal is to partner with larger charities in the United States, including well-known organizations such as Green Peace and Red Cross. He hopes to do some cross-promotion to make sure their donors are aware of Drops.
In the meantime, however, the young entrepreneur is dedicating all his energy and attention to introducing Drops to the public and spreading the word.
“I’m just taking it step by step,” Rouda said. “Our main focus right now is to provide a great Beta experience for those who want to test it out. Come March or April, we’ll go full-time launch and open it up to everyone.”
Drops is the first company Rouda has started on his own, and he has found the experience to be rewarding.
“Every time I see some measurable change or hear feedback from someone that says our app has been a great service, I feel a great sense of pride and fulfillment,” Rouda said. “It’s certainly a lot of work, but I encourage anyone who has a good startup idea to just stick with it. Once you find an idea that’s worth pursuing, you’ll know, and you just won’t let it go.”

The USC men’s volleyball team (3-11, 3-9 MPSF) upset No. 5 Hawaii (10-5, 5-5 MPSF) in a five-set battle (25-18, 20-25, 21-25, 26-24, 17-15) after losing to them in five sets on Monday. 
The Trojans were led by junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder. Yoder tallied up 21 kills and 11 digs while hitting .279. He also led the team Monday night with 16 kills while hitting .448. 
Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught recorded the second most kills on the team with 15, while sophomore opposite Jon Rivera recorded 11 kills. 
Sophomore setter Jack Yoder recorded 56 assists in the win and another 37 the night before.
Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh led the team with five kills. Rivera and Slaught both recorded five kills. Senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard tallied up two kills. Monday night, Leonard led the team with six kills, while Jack Yoder put up four and Benesh tallied three. 
Towards the end of the fifth set, it was 14-11 Hawaii. USC managed to battle off that match point and score three straight points to tie it at 14-all. Hawaii recorded a kill to make it 15-14, but USC scored another three straight points to take the set 17-15. Slaught secured the win with a kill to finish out the set. 
This was the Trojans’ fourth consecutive five-set match, but the only one that the team has won in that span. This win against the Rainbow Warriors broke USC’s three match losing streak.
There were a total of 27 tie scores throughout the match, but only eight lead changes. Twelve of the tie scores came in the fourth set, which the Trojans won 26-24.
Despite being out-blocked 16.0 to 8.5, the Trojans still out hit the Rainbow Warriors .245 to .238. USC also recorded two more kills than Hawaii, 63 to 61. USC also recorded more digs than Hawaii, 49 to 39. 
The win against the Rainbow Warriors finished up USC’s week long 4 match homestand. The Trojans won’t play another match until they face off at No. 10 UC Santa Barbara next Wednesday, February 24th. USC’s next home match will be the following Saturday when they host No. 3 UCLA.

Standing at 18-7 after their recent losses at Arizona and Arizona State, the now unranked Trojans continue to have their biggest weakness exposed: playing on the road.
Wednesday night, the Men of Troy look to protect their unbeaten 14-0 record at home against the visiting Colorado Buffaloes (19-7), chasing USC’s historic 20-game home winning streak achieved between 1939 and 1941.
The Trojans (18-7) have already secured the best home record in a single season by winning 14 games at the Galen Center this year and could add to that number with wins against Colorado Wednesday and Utah on Sunday.
Winning their 15th straight at home will be challenging, however, considering USC is now 7-5 in Pac-12 play and riding a two-game losing streak against two teams the Trojans previously defeated at home.
“We’re just trying to regain focus; this is the second road trip we’ve gone on and didn’t get a win,” freshman forward Chimezie Metu said. “So, we’re just trying to come home and regain our focus.”
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, head coach Andy Enfield gave his players some slack for going on the road, but reaffirmed his commitment to winning basketball games.
“For the most part this year, we’ve played extremely hard, so I’m not going to get upset at our players,” Enfield said. “But there are times when in key stretches of games, when the other teams are going on runs, where you have to really focus, and you’ve just got to lay it on the line.”
USC’s Friday loss at Arizona State was plagued with missed opportunities as the Men of Troy only made two of their 11 3-point attempts and also turned over the ball 17 times.
Not to mention, the Trojans fouled the Sun Devils 20 times, leading to ASU sinking 16 of its 26 free-throw shots to go along with their 41 percent overall shooting percentage.
Freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, usually a cool-headed shooter, was held scoreless as he missed all four of his field goals while fouling out. Nikola Jovanovic was exceptional in Tempe, recording a game-high 15 rebounds and 25 points.
Against Arizona, USC lost again but not for the same reasons as they had against the Sun Devils.
In Tucson, the Trojans limited their turnovers to just eight, shot 44 percent from beyond the arc and were virtually neck and neck with the Wildcats in terms of rebounding but still dropped their second straight.
Arizona managed to shoot 50 percent from the field, knocking down eight three pointers and 18 of their 24 free-throws en route to an 8-point win.
Instead of freshman forward Bennie Boatwright fouling out, Metu fouled out against Arizona while Boatwright scored a game-high 18 points.
In their two games against the Wildcats and Sun Devils, USC lost by an average of 7.5 points, culminating to an average margin of defeat of 8.6 in their 2015-2016 campaign.
With a 19-7 Colorado team coming into Los Angeles Wednesday, the Trojans will have to deal with a ballclub which is third in the Pac-12, holding eight wins against the likes of Washington, Washington State, Oregon, Oregon State, Stanford and Cal.
Of those teams, USC still has yet to conquer Oregon and Oregon State after losing to both schools in late January 89-81 and 85-70, respectively.
A potential point of improvement for this team could be 3-point defense and foul trouble.
In their last two games, the Trojans have amassed 40 personal fouls, leading to 50 free-throws and 34 points. As for the 3-point defense, USC has limited opponents from beyond the arc, ranking first in the Pac-12 with just 30.5 percent of 3s going past the Trojans.
The Buffaloes, however, rank first in the Pac-12 in 3-point offense, splashing 39.6 percent of their long balls thanks to 3-point master George King, who has completed 54 of his 119 3-pointers while averaging 14.3 points per game.
The Buffs also rank first in the Pac-12 in free-throw percentage, sinking 476 of their 648 shots. Among the top free-throw shooters for Colorado are Xavier Talton, Tre’Shaun Fletcher and Dominique Collier who have combined for 122 of 149 from the charity stripe.
With four home games left in the season, USC still has a chance to finish their season off strong taking into account their success in L.A. At home, the Men of Troy have an average margin of victory of 16.1, outscoring opponents by 19 points or more at a total of seven times.
“The Pac-12 is really tough on the road, just like we haven’t really won any road games, people haven’t won at Galen Center,” Metu said. “For the tournament, it’s at neutral sites; that’s a whole other ballgame.”
If the Trojans can utilize preventive interior defensive practices and not foul Colorado’s good shooters while still maintaining an impermeable outside presence, USC’s home winning streak could potentially be extended to 15.
The 18-7 Trojans are set to battle the 19-7 Buffaloes at 8 p.m. at the Galen Center.

The women’s swim and dive program led the conference in athletes named to the Pac-12 All-Century Swim and Dive Team, with 10 Trojans on the list of 26 total athletes, announced by the Pac-12 on Monday night. The well-decorated USC program stood out on an all-conference team of national and Olympic champions.
The 10 athletes named to the list were Cynthia Woodhead (freestyle sprints), Haley Anderson (freestyle distance), Lindsay Benko-Mintenko (freestyle distance), Rebecca Soni (breaststroke), Katinka Hosszu (individual medley), Kristine Quance-Julian (individual medley and breaststroke), Kaitlin Sandeno (individual medley), Blythe Hartley (IM Diving, 3-Meter), Victoria Ishimatsu (IM Diving) and Haley Ishimatsu (platform). Quance-Julian and Hartley were two of only five athletes to make the team in more than one specialty.
Each of the 26 swimmers named to the list has competed in at least one Olympic games and as a group notched 101 Olympic medals. Individually, the Trojans were accordingly well-decorated. Woodhead won three gold medals at the 1978 World Championships when she was only 14-years-old and set seven world records in her career, though she was unable to compete in the Olympics due to the 1980 boycott of the Moscow Olympics.
Anderson earned an Olympic silver medal in 2012, and Benko-Mintenko earned gold medals in 2000 and 2004 and held the world record in freestyle distance. Soni is a six-time Olympic medalist, winning two gold medals in Beijing and one in London. Hosszu competed in the Olympics and won the World Championships five times, breaking records in multiple distances.
Quance-Julian won gold at the 1996 Olympics, and Hartley won bronze in 2004. Sandeno took home four Olympic medals, including gold in 2004, and helped to break the 4×200 relay by more than two seconds that year. Haley Ishimatsu was a world champion. Her sister Victoria Ishimatsu is the only four-time Pac-12 diver of the year. She currently coaches the diving team.
The women’s program joined the men’s program in leading their respective All-Century teams in athletes represented. The list represented a century of conference and nation-wide domination by Trojan athletes in swim and dive.

This weekend, a guy jumped over a mascot and dunked a basketball. No big deal. Sure, it wasn’t Taylor Swift dissing Kanye at the Grammys or a political statement by Kendrick, but man, was it entertaining.
The dunk contest at the NBA All-Star Weekend can be a thing of beauty, and this year it was. It was a phenomenal display of athletic talent by two young men no older than myself. Aaron Gordon and Zach LaVine dueled Saturday night and showed the world why nothing beats the NBA’s All-Star Festivities.
Who doesn’t want to watch athletes show off their superior athletic talent and do tricks in the air that leave you wondering how it was even possible. The slam dunk is not only one of the most entertaining plays in basketball, but also all of sports.
It doesn’t carry the same weight as a Grand Slam or a Hail Mary, but those are special; the dunk is normal. It happens in every basketball game we watch, and yet it got the most special treatment when two spectacular athletes battled each other, topping each other again and again to earn the crown of Slam Dunk Contest champion.
The SDC shows the most basic beauty and love for the game, something easily translated across languages and cultures to fans of all ages around the world.
Aaron Gordon showed us his stuff when he leaped over Stuff the Magic Dragon, the Magic’s aptly named mascot, doing something seemingly even more impossible each time. He jumped high enough in one dunk to have earned a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
On the other hand, champion Zach LaVine displayed the power and agile movements of a cat, soaring through the air with grace, speed and force only to slam the ball down at the last moment after executing a series of turns and spins that would make a gymnast do a double take.
The roots of the love for the game of basketball were exposed in this contest. There was competition, finesse, grace, power and execution, but most of all there was fun. All of the dunk contest participants and other NBA players sitting courtside looked like they had the joy of young kids playing ball in the park. The show being put on was unlike any NBA game where millions of dollars and playoff berths are on the line; this was purely for the love of the dunk.
Nothing is more electrifying to an arena of anxious fans than a dunk. Nothing puts an exclamation point on the game quite like a dunk can do in the final seconds and nothing quite impresses like a dunk if for no other reason than everyone is aware of how physically incapable they are of emulating it. This translates well to our own basketball team that is one of the most electrifying teams in the conference, if not the country. The rate and skill with which the Trojans dunk the basketball is an absolute joy to watch.
The team has a total of 86 dunks through the first 23 games of the season, more than doubling their opponents’ total of 41. Freshman dunking phenom Chimezie Metu has 36 dunks. Junior Julian Jacobs is second to Metu with 23 on the year, already surpassing his 19 from last season.
This exponential increase in dunking has led to an increase in excitement and is one of many reasons why the Trojans are such a fun team to watch.
The glee and fierce competitiveness that comes from a slam dunk is so unique to the game of basketball. Within the select number of athletes who can execute it, there is then another level of athleticism required to make it memorable.
During a fast break during USC’s game against ASU, Metu threw the ball off the backboard to himself and finished it with a slam. The creativity or perhaps desperation of this move is something that can stand on his personal highlight reel for years to come.
In the same way, LaVine and Gordon have made a name for themselves from the unbelievable performances they gave Saturday night.
The dunk is exhilarating, majestic and captivating all in the span of a few moments and that is why the dunk is so special. So for all those who have the capability to dunk, please let this be your go-ahead. We all love it. Thank you for letting us vicariously soar through the clouds for a few moments every time you reach up for that hoop and throw the ball down.

Trojan tennis finally has a place to call home. The new Marks Stadium was officially inaugurated in front of a crowd of fans and supporters on Tuesday.
Complete with new locker rooms, a training room, a recovery room, covered seats and improved courts, the new stadium has garnered praise from current and former players alike.
Outside the facility, together with a performance from the marching band, the ceremony started with Steve Lopes, the senior associate athletic director. Lopes recognized the donors and thanked them for their important support.
First to speak in front of the crowd were Richard Gallien and Peter Smith, head coaches of the women’s and men’s team respectively.
“It feels like winning an NCAA championship,” Smith said. “It was not a perfect season, but at the end we won.”
It was then time for seniors Giuliana Olmos and Max de Vroome.
“Coach really knows how to motivate us,” de Vroome said. “When I was playing in the final of the 2014 NCAA Tournament and I was up 5-4 he came to me and said, ‘Look Max, if you clinch this, we’ll get a brand new stadium,’ and here it is.”
The present and past of both the men’s and women’s programs attended the event. Former athlete Amanda Flink (2005-2009) was in the crowd.
“I’m really upset that this stuff wasn’t here when I was here,” Flink said. “This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. The facility is incredible, the courts look incredible. It’s such a gift for the players to play on it. It’s definitively something this program deserves.”
Olmos spoke about the impact the new facilities will have on the team.
“I’m really excited for the brand new stadium,” Olmos said after the event. “We did really well last year. We finished ranked No. 2 in the country and we didn’t have a nice stadium as we have now. Now we have a training room, a learning studio and a training center that is like a recovery room. It’s just so exciting for us that we have even more. I’m excited to see how the program improves. This definitely gives us the home court advantage … and definitely makes us work harder and appreciate what we have.”
The training room carries the name of Steve Johnson, who led the Trojans to win four NCAA championships during his college experience and is currently ranked 31 in the world, while the men’s locker room is dedicated to current men’s team head coach Peter Smith.
With Marks Stadium officially inaugurated, the first team to step on the finished facility will be the Women of Troy, who will face the Cal Golden Bears on Friday, at 1:30 p.m. The men’s team is not playing at home until April, when they will face Cal on April 1 at 3 p.m.
New stadium deserves a new women coach. Gallien has more than enough years to show no matter the quality of his players he can’t get to the finish line nationally.

For the first time in program history, the Women of Troy are undefeated, winning their season opener.  Instrumental in the team’s commanding victory over Stetson on Saturday was junior attacker Michaela Michael.
In the team’s 21-2 win, Michael notched six goals, an assist and 12 draw controls to earn her the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week Award. For Michael, this award is her second honor in addition to a Rookie of the Week award in her 2014 debut. For the Trojans, this award counts as their 13th overall certificate.
Michael is thrilled with the team’s performance against Stetson and the feeling of being undefeated.
“This is the first time our team has been 1-0. I think we did a really great job focusing on the little things and focusing on ourselves,” Michael said. “We’re undefeated so it feels really good to start the season off clean.”
Leading by example, Michael remains a strong asset to the team chemistry and cohesion.
“The biggest thing was in the midfield for us, on the draw controls and then our midfield ride, I think that’s the moment where all 12 players are working together so I think that was a big thing for us to really be able to bond together as a unit on the field,” head coach Lindsey Munday said.” Every single person contributed to this game because every single person prepared us during pre-season.”
To be successful in the remainder of the season, working together will be key. With a clean start, the No. 18 Trojans face a difficult road ahead with No. 5 Duke on the horizon for Saturday at 7 p.m. at Lebard Stadium in Costa Mesa, California. In a rematch of the 2015 NCAA Round of 16 contest that ended the Trojan’s season, the two teams will meet again in a non-conference battle.
In the game, Michael will remain a crucial component of the Trojan offense. Against Stetson, Michael dominated from all sides recording six goals for the second time in her career. The other occasion was against Colorado in 2015.
Continuing to break records, Michael’s 12 draw controls marks the most in a single game for her own career and the third highest in league history. In one of Michael’s best performances to date, she earned the MPSF single-game record for 15 draw controls against Fresno State last year. In the culmination of the Trojan 2015 season, Michael continued to earn decorations, named to the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association All-American third team on May 18. In their strongest season in their third year as a program, Michael recorded 63 goals, holding the Trojan record for goals in a season.
But for Michael, each day marks an opportunity for improvement. Michael has a positive outlook as the team prepares for Saturday’s contest against the Blue Devils.
“We  have  a lot of work this week, a lot of preparation,”Michael said. “I’m confident that we can do it. We just have to work hard this week.”

Senior golfer Bobby Gojuangco was chosen to play in the Northern Trust Open Collegiate Showcase held Monday at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. He shot a 5-over-par 76, playing a difficult course set up for the professional tournament.
The event was set up so that 14 college golfers were paired with 14 PGA Tour professionals who are alumni of their respective  colleges. In addition, each group also contained two other alumni from the school, generally athletic donors. The talented collegiate field included Charlie Danielson of the University of Illinois, the fourth-ranked college golfer nationally and the event’s winner with a round of 68, as well as the University of Texas’ Beau Hossler, the third-ranked college golfer in his freshman year, who briefly held the lead at the 2012 U.S. Open at the age of 17. With his victory, Danielson earned an entry into the main tournament this weekend.
Playing professionally were stars such as the top-ranked golfer in the world Jordan Spieth, and top-30 players J.B. Holmes, Jimmy Walker and Paul Casey. Gojuangco was paired with Trojan alumnus Jamie Lovemark, who is coming off a difficult 2015, but his year was highlighted by a top-20 finish in the U.S. Open.
The PGA professionals along with two other alumni from each university also competed in a best ball tournament where the winners earned a $50,000 contribution to the school’s golf team. The University of Texas, led by Spieth, captured that aspect of the tournament to earn the generous prize.
Gojuangco will return to the seventh-ranked USC golf team who are hoping to build on their successes this season, winning the Amer Ari Invitational last weekend, and coming off of a runner-up finish in the match play championship last season.
The Northern Trust Open begins this Thursday and runs through the weekend and features some of the world’s top golfers including Spieth, Bubba Watson and Rory McIlroy.

The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday ends a legacy of racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia as well as persistent opposition to same-sex marriage and funding for Planned Parenthood. The passing of Justice Scalia most importantly presents an opportunity to even the playing field after generations of oppression and discrimination, as colorblindness in the college admissions process perpetuates the racial achievement gap in higher education.
Scalia’s death affects the outcome of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, a case currently before the Supreme Court in which the plaintiff, Fisher, argues that her rejection from the University violated her 14th amendment right to equal protection. According to Fisher, the University rejected her in order to accept a minority applicant with lesser credentials due to affirmative action policies. With Scalia gone, it is likely that the outcome of the case will change from a predicted 5-3 decision in favor of the conservative side, dismantling affirmative action in admissions, to a 4-3 decision. Since Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself  from the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy currently serves as the swing vote. Certainly, the rhetoric surrounding the conservative wing of the Supreme Court illustrates why Kennedy’s decision will either destroy or preserve civil liberties in this country.
Scalia made his opinions on the case clear in December when he remarked the following: “There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas, where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well … Maybe [the University of Texas] ought to have fewer. And maybe … when you take more, the number of blacks, really competent blacks, admitted to lesser schools, turns out to be less. And I don’t think it stands to reason that it’s a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible.”
Of course, it is inherently unjustified for a white male of sound socioeconomic standing to speak on or understand — let alone decide or resolve — what constitutes the experiences of black Americans. According to the Cornell Legal Institute, affirmative action is “a set of procedures designed to eliminate unlawful discrimination between applicants, remedy the results of such prior discrimination, and prevent such discrimination in the future.” With this understanding in mind, Scalia’s comments actually have little to do with the constitutionality of affirmative action and more to do with his own perception of black Americans as inherently inferior.
If the college admissions process is truly a merit-based system, not one in accordance to the distribution of resources, quality or otherwise, then maybe affirmative action would be of little importance. However, affirmative action is a socially responsible, institutionalized response to the structural and systemic racism that makes up the education system in America. Moreover, affirmative action policies address the fact that the majority of low-income students are minorities — which means access to quality curriculum, supplementary materials like textbooks, tutors and online resources and teachers are disproportionately unavailable to these students.
What people — specifically white students and administrators — need to understand is that applicants do not gain admission into an institute of higher education because of their race alone. The policies set in place, however, ensure that they are not discounted or relegated to a lower status because of their race. Affirmative action is not a racial quota system, as is assumed by many, or an advantage over white or non-minority students, but an equalizer. In response to Fisher’s claim of discrimination, it is important to note that she did not get rejected because she was not black or another minority — she was rejected because she did not have the merit to gain admittance. To those who oppose affirmative action, there is no such thing as reverse racism, and no one student received admission into a university because he or she was black alone.
Scalia’s remarks regarding black students illustrate the serious need for affirmative action. If a man with an advanced law degree, who is appointed to one of the highest positions in the U.S. government and is responsible for an unbiased interpretation of the Constitution, contends that black students are  unqualified for higher education, it is clear the system that governs all realms of society is racist. Assuming that black students are not worthy of top-tier universities due to their socioeconomic standing is not only ignorant but also unjustifiable.
Above all else, it is important to note that affirmative action is quite simple, though it is often misrepresented as an unfair, outdated advantage. Even if that were to be true, affirmative action would still be token at best when compared to the unfair and long-standing advantage that is white privilege. While it is ignorant to assume that all black students come from low-income neighborhoods and are as a result less prepared for university life, it is fair to say that all black students have in some form or another experienced racism — a piece of acquired knowledge white students are not only lucky enough to never be scared by but also something they are entirely unaware of. Black students, in the face of racism, adversity and prejudice, are more than capable of not only gaining admittance into top-tier institutions but also excelling in academia. Affirmative action is necessary to ensure black students receive what they rightfully deserve — a college education.

Gee whiz !   Thought I was reading an old movie script that included;  ” Ding-dong, the witch  is dead.”
To Scalia’s credit, his personal opinions didn’t factor in his jurisprudent responsibilities.  And it’s not surprising many journalist encourage legislating laws or their agendas wrongly via appointed Justices and not elected leaders.
Affirmative active, in and of itself, is a racist, bigoted action that only perpetuates the thought process that blacks, men and women, need to be considered for a position because of their skin color.  There may have been a legitimate reason for this regulation 30 years ago, but not today. There is so much racism in this country that is promoted by blacks and the secular Left, that it only serves to spread the gap of equality and peacefulness in this country.  The Congressional Black Caucus, The Black/ Latino/ Asian/ whatever  Student Union, BET Network, JET Magazine, The Black Lives Matter movement… are all disjointed groups that state they are for equal treatment of black sin this country, but actually do not promote equality amongst everyone. Why are you writing about the failed leadership in the black communities around this country to promote a healthy community for the children, a healthy lifestyle for the people, community development so that people feel safe in their own neighborhoods?  Work on that, and everything else becomes reality.  
And you speak of the racist SCOTUS and Scalia? You don;t know his voting history, nor the purpose of SCOTUS.  The US Supreme Court is in place to rule on existing law, not create law.  And yes, SCOTUS, over the past 7 years, have created law, as has president Obama, which the president is not allowed to do.  But that’s another rant.  
The US lost a great man of high esteem, intelligence and fairness.  He executed his role in SCOTUS to rule on law, based on the US Constitution, not some emotional ” well it’s a living document” story that the secular Left and the Democratic leadership are trying to convince you of.  If folks continue to try to change the interpretation of the US Constitution, then we don’t have one.

Swathed in an artificial veneer, Los Angeles — a city known for its mild weather and entertainment attractions — rarely reminds us of harsh realities. One might be surprised to learn that L.A. has the greatest population of chronically homeless people in the nation, according to federal figures released by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department last year. Last week, L.A. city and county officials announced their plans to effectively tackle this epidemic — a collective response to last year’s 12 percent upsurge in homelessness. These plans, although progressive in nature, are only the beginning  of a campaign, which must begin with the decriminalization of homelessness.
Today, there are an estimated 44,000 people living on L.A. streets, in vehicles and in encampments. To illustrate the gravity of this estimate, the ever-expanding number of homeless people in L.A. exceeds the population of Culver City.
Rising rents are typically cited as the primary force behind the massive displacement of Angelenos. From 2000 to 2013, while renters’ median income declined 7 percent, the median rent for an apartment in L.A. County increased 27 percent, according to the California Housing Partnership Corporation. This deluge of facts and figures has, in part, served as the impetus to the city and county’s recent response.
The efficacy of these proposed plans remains to be seen. L.A. County, which spends nearly $1 billion each year on health and welfare services related to homelessness, has set aside an additional $150 million to directly address the issue. With the creation of new programs, the plan intends to house 3,500 homeless people by June 2017. For its part, the city has proposed a plan to spend $1.85 billion on housing over the next decade. Early into the 2016-2017 fiscal year, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti proposed spending an additional $100 million to provide not only affordable housing and rental subsidies but also case management and crucial health services.
The announcement of these plans marks one significant victory — an unprecedented display of cooperation from county and city officials. Other attempts to address the issue of homelessness have failed in the past because of disagreement between the two bodies. Political will, however, is at a remarkable high in light of constituents’ concerns about their communities. Voters will hopefully reflect this concern on the ballot come November or March of next year, when they will likely decide whether to approve additional funding. With the support of nonprofits and advocates dedicated to reducing homelessness, elected officials may see these plans through to fruition.
Despite the strengths of these plans, there are obvious flaws in L.A.’s approach to solving this crisis. Without the decriminalization of homelessness, the city will continue to wastefully spend funds on enforcement, rather than necessary housing and health services. The Inner City Law Center has called upon Garcetti to veto existing legislation criminalizing homelessness, including one law that approves the seizure and destruction of homeless persons’ personal possessions under the pretense of public health and safety. Los Angeles must end all punitive laws against homeless residents, redirecting the $87 million wasted on law enforcement toward the costs of the aforementioned plans, which contain otherwise effective solutions.
Homelessness, in particular, should be an issue of significant concern to USC as both an academic institution fostering disadvantaged students and a member of the local community. According to 2013-14 Federal Student Aid Form data, more than 56,000 university students personally identified as homeless nationwide. Indeed, past and present USC students have experienced or are currently experiencing the devastating effects of displacement. The Fisher Fellowship is one USC program, among many, that provides disadvantaged students with the support and recognition they so deserve. Moreover, USC must also recognize its surrounding neighborhood. The University Park Campus is situated less than five miles from Skid Row — an area of downtown Los Angeles that is home to one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States. Student advocacy groups on campus, like Swipe Out Hunger, acknowledge USC’s responsibility to local communities like Skid Row.
Just as local government has taken the initiative to combat homelessness, students interested in social justice and activism should do the same.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
Since President Barack Obama’s launch of the It’s On Us campaign to combat the national epidemic of campus sexual assault in 2014, the issue has developed into a series of discussions on campuses nationwide. The “1 in 5” statistic — that one in five college-aged women will be sexually assaulted — has become regularly cited evidence of the pervasiveness of campus sexual assault. So when Wolfgang Ballinger, the president of Cornell’s Psi Upsilon fraternity, was arrested and charged with attempted rape, it highlights only one of many incidents of sexual violence within greek life. Eliminating this violence altogether comes from acknowledging that greek life plays an integral part in sexual violence on campus.
Every year, there seems to be a new national story of fraternity misogyny, whether it’s chants of “No means yes, yes means anal” at Yale, a Texas Tech fraternity hanging a banner with the same slogan or the Wesleyan “rape factory” case. Defenders of greek life may excuse these as isolated incidents of a few bad eggs, but the statistics of sexual violence in greek life paint a disturbing picture. According to a study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, fraternity brothers are three times more likely to rape a woman than non-greeks, and according to the National Institute of Justice, there is a correlation between sorority membership and the likelihood of sexual assault. A University of Oregon study concluded that greek women were a shocking 3.4 times as likely to suffer rape or attempted rape than their non-greek counterparts. Though campus sexual assault is not a uniquely greek issue, numerous studies make it clear that greek life is a significant factor in perpetuating sexual violence on campus. Despite this fact, greek life is rabidly defended.
Fraternity apologists leap to point out the “good guys” in frats, the charity work done by both fraternities and sororities and the leadership opportunities within the greek system. This is all true. Of course the majority of fraternity brothers don’t commit violent felonies, and of course many of them are ”good guys.” When confronted with the statistics of sexual violence in greek life, however, arguments about the amount of “good guys” in frats become meaningless.  Pointing toward philanthropy or leadership opportunities in greek life is only a distraction; the good side of greek life does not make the dark side any less troubling. The thought of a national sexual assault epidemic can seem distant, but in truth, it is an especially serious issue at USC.
In a study of 27 top U.S. schools, including every Ivy League university other than Princeton, USC had the second highest rate of sexual assault. According to a campus climate survey, 30 percent of Trojan women are sexually assaulted during their time at USC. A 2008 USC study found that greek women were more than twice as likely to suffer attempted rape than non-greek women. These results are appalling, especially for a university that prides itself on its Trojan family.
USC is an excellent institution, and greek life has much to offer, but both must address their shortfalls by strengthening programs to curtail widespread sexual assault. Emory University’s greek sexual assault prevention initiative, for example, aims to increase bystander intervention and sexual assault awareness within the greek community. At USC, the Intrafraternity Council, which held WE CARE, the USC Greeks Stand Against Sexual Violence program, last April, should reimplement the program during Sexual Assault Awareness Month this year.
USC should also implement stronger punitive measures and find new, safer venues for greek parties. Fewer than one third of students found guilty of sexual assault are expelled, and harsher punishments could deter this crime. Furthermore, lifting the national ban on alcohol in sorority houses could relocate parties to sorority houses, which would be safer for women.
The increased visibility of college sexual assault as a national epidemic is a victory for victims everywhere, and it is an injustice to deny the disproportionate role greek life has played in this epidemic. Of course, college sexual violence at USC and elsewhere spreads far beyond the Row, and it is naive to assert that reforming greek culture is the only change needed on campus. Addressing the violence in greek life, however, is an important part of reforming a culture conducive to sexual misconduct as a whole.
If anything… This isn’t another “sad example of rape culture”… It’s most certainly another sad example of the rush to judgement in order to vilify men and most likely another sad example of a woman who regretted her behavior and threw someone else under the bus to wash her hands of it.   It’s sad, pathetic, and men everywhere are getting tired of it.    Myself:   I refuse to be alone with a female I don’t trust with my life…. Because all she has to do is cry and be anointed victim status… And down you go with almost zero recourse.    Sad.

Tucked away next to the Joint Educational Project House on 34th Street sits a quaint cafe underground. A small gate leads down a few steps and into Dean’s List Café. Outside, luscious green vines against brick walls and countless succulents give the space a tranquil atmosphere. A beautiful little patio in front of the entrance is scattered with tree trunks as table tops. Surrounded by greenery, and even chirping birds, this courtyard is its own little escape from campus. Twinkling lights are strung across the top for when the sun goes down, giving the area charming vibes. Inside, wood floors and long wooden tables give the room a warm, casual coffee-shop feeling. Around noon on a Thursday, people chat with friends, study on their laptops, or simply enjoy a lovely lunch at this hidden shop.
Reading over the list of coffee, tea, paninis, crepes, boba and milkshakes, recommendations from the staff were needed to make a decision. According to the barista, the most-ordered items on the menu are the paninis and the iced matcha green tea. The paninis are sizeable, and almost everyone in the restaurant who was eating had ordered one. However, the strawberry-banana-Nutella crepe, along with an iced matcha green tea, sounded fantastic. The barista asked what kind of milk was preferred for the tea, offering options of regular, almond or soy milk. Almost every restaurant charges extra for almond or soy milk, but not at Dean’s List; it is nice being able to choose a preference without the extra cost. In addition, there is a fridge full of pre-made salads, wraps, juices and soda providing other options. At $10 for the crepe and drink, the food and beverage prices are about average for a local café. Whether one craves something sweet or savory, healthy or indulgent, Dean’s List has an assortment of options.
Only two employees were working at the time, who were friendly as well as helpful. The small area used for cooking is pretty limited, so everything is made to order. After a few minutes, the massive strawberry-banana-Nutella stuffed crepe appeared on the table. Unfortunately, the crepe was not the best. Though packed with a plethora of fresh bananas and strawberries — inside and outside — with just the perfect amount of Nutella and a sprinkle of powdered sugar, the actual crepe itself was not warm or soft but instead crisp and cool. The thin layer of crepe didn’t measure up to what was expected, although the appearance of it was wonderful, not to mention very filling. However, the iced matcha green tea is perfect for those craving something that is just a tad sweet. This drink itself is a refreshing light treat, especially for a warm day in L.A. The three iced tea options on the menu can be made with boba; Dean’s List is one of the only places to get boba on campus, so one may want to take advantage and try it out.
In the center of the shop, there is a large-screen projector that hangs down which supposedly has movies playing sometimes; however, at that specific time, nothing was playing and it was pretty quiet inside. The calm atmosphere of Dean’s List allows for a relaxing afternoon or evening.
Dean’s List is a relaxing study spot where there is no sense of rush or urgency. It is an ideal place to hang out with friends, get some studying in or just stopping by for a casual, refreshing treat. Overall, this place should definitely be on the radar to check out.
Dean’s List is open weekdays 11 a.m.-10 p.m. and weekends 11 a.m.-7 p.m.

Los Angeles Opera presented its first performance of the new year on Feb. 13 with Barrie Kosky and Suzanne Andrade’s fanciful production of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Magic Flute. The performance was held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
The production, which returns to L.A. Opera after a successful run in its 2013-2014 season, is unlike anything one would normally expect to see on the operatic stage. Co-conceived with London-based performance company 1927, Kosky/Andrade’s The Magic Flute combines vaudevillian aesthetics with cinematic motifs of the 1920s. Strikingly vivid visual projections replace a traditional, physical set, enhancing the illusion that one is actually viewing a silent, arthouse film reminiscent of the era rather than a live performance. Overall, the entire show is a grand spectacle.
In the program notes, Kosky states, “[The] challenge is to embrace the heterogeneous nature of this opera … You almost have to celebrate the contradictions and inconsistencies of the plot and the characters, as well as the mix of fantasy, surrealism, magic and deeply touching human emotions.” Indeed, this highly-collaborative production provides a refreshing update to an otherwise contrived storyline.
From a musical standpoint, the production was equally as delightful. The orchestra, led by music director of L.A. Opera James Conlon, upheld a precise balance that was neither exhaustive nor timid. The singers, comprised of up-and-coming starlets on the brink of international success, offered captivating interpretations that were just as fresh as the production itself. Tenor Ben Bliss sang the role of Tamino with intelligent phrasing that complimented his round, plummy tone. Norwegian soprano Marita Sølberg made her L.A. Opera debut as Pamina, maintaining impressive control over her naturally rotund voice. Her Act II aria “Ach, ich fühl’s” was particularly breathtaking.
The finest singing of the night, however, belonged to soprano So Young Park, who made quite an impression as Queen of the Night. Park, a current participant in L.A. Opera’s Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist Program, was able to capture the character’s madness without sacrificing her impeccable vocal technique, as was evident in her second aria “Der Hölle Rache.” She received the largest ovation during the curtain call.
Other standouts include baritone Jonathan Michie, whose comedic presence lent itself well to the role of Papageno. Bass Wilhelm Schwinghammer, also making his LA Opera debut, provided a solid portrayal as Sarastro. As the Three Ladies, sopranos Stacey Tappan, Summer Hassan and mezzo-soprano Peabody Southwell provided some of the most beautiful harmonies of the evening. Just as charming was soprano Vanessa Becerra, who sang a dulcet-toned Papagena.
In addition to offering world class performances, LA Opera strives to instill the love of classical music into its younger audiences. Many programs have been created to directly benefit students, such as Opera U, a series which offers full-time high school and college student discounted performance tickets. Fran Rizzi, director of public relations at LA Opera, spoke about these programs.
“Through [Opera U], students sign up for a newsletter, and send students an email, typically 48 hours before the performance, when Student Rush tickets become available,” Rizzi said.
Furthermore, the new year marks the commencement of LA Opera’s Tweet Seats, in which students are selected to live-tweet throughout the show from their seats, abolishing the stigma of cell phone use during a performance.
“We try very hard to make sure everyone has access to the opera,” Rizzi said.
The Magic Flute runs until March 6. Further information regarding student programs and performance dates can be found online.

On Monday night, CBS broadcasted the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, music’s biggest night that honors the year’s best performances. The award show was held at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles and hosted by rapper and NCIS star LL Cool J, who has now hosted the ceremony five times.
In recent years, the Grammys have had an overhaul of categories for their awards, especially those they choose to broadcast live. However, Monday’s telecast showcased  more live performances and fewer award presentations and speeches. The majority of the awards focused on the best albums in each of the major genres, as well as Song of the Year and  Record of the Year, respectively.
The highlights of the night included several performances by some of the biggest names in music today. Audiences across the world were treated to Taylor Swift opening of the show, following The Weeknd’s ballad version of “In the Night” and Kendrick Lamar’s powerful arrangement of tracks from his acclaimed album, To Pimp a Butterfly. The cast of the Broadway hit Hamilton brought the crowd to their feet with a medley of songs from the musical, which merges early American history and hip-hop.
Transitioning into the memoriam of late musical heroes, Lady Gaga paid tribute to rock legend David Bowie with covers of his songs, while Jackson Browne and The Eagles remembered Glenn Frey, a core member of the band. Chris Stapleton, winner of Best Country Album, took the stage with Gary Clark Jr. and Bonnie Raitt to perform late-blues legend B.B. King’s “The Thrill is Gone.”
Additionally, Adele’s  highly anticipated performance was distorted due to technical issues, but the English singer displayed great poise and composure throughout her set. Other performers throughout the evening included Stevie Wonder, Alabama Shakes, Justin Bieber, Pitbull, Demi Lovato and Carrie Underwood. On CBS’s online portal, viewers were able to take a look behind the scenes and see live interviews of award recipients and performers backstage.
Perhaps the strongest reactions of this year’s show were attributed to Kendrick Lamar’s performance, who enthralled viewers with a high energy rendition of “Blacker the Berry,” “Alright,” and “Untitled 3,” with depictions of a chain gang and protest with unique camerawork incorperated on stage. However, a considerable amount of dissent was felt over the Grammy’s decision to award Taylor Swift the award for Album of the Year for 1989, as Lamar swept the awards in the rap categories for his album. Different reasonings for Lamar’s loss range from race to commercialism, as the album scored a composite 96 percent on Metacritic, as compared to 76 percent for Swift’s release.
Nonetheless, both performers conducted themselves with class, as Swift hugged Lamar before receiving her award. Swift is the first woman in history to win Album of the Year twice, and used this feat as inspiration for the next generation in her speech. Swift’s statement also took the higher road in another ordeal, with a subtle reference at the inflammatory Kanye West lyrics in his latest release, The Life of Pablo, where a misogynistic remark digs up old feuds from the 2009 VMA incident. Without mentioning the rapper by name, Swift decried West’s lyrics and encouraged young women to “focus on the work” and not let people “undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”
The Grammys presented the most awards to first-time winners this year; likewise, it will be interesting to see if this will be the beginning of many great careers from these newer artists.

I broke up with someone a couple weeks ago. He had just come off of two years of wild shenanigans and was ready to be serious with someone. I was coming off the first meaningful relationship I’d had in years, and all I wanted was wild shenanigans.
We talked for a while after I told him we should stop dating, and he told me he had been broken up with around the same time last year too. I was surprised at first, and sad for him, but it makes sense; it’s the end of cuffing season. People stop needing a consistent warm body to make it through those bitter sixty-degree L.A. winters.
I wasn’t worried about how this would change Valentine’s Day for me — Palentine’s Day had always been more my speed. Even when I was dating someone come the middle of February, I usually opted to do something with friends instead. Valentine’s Day dates were too heavy, too loaded – even with someone I liked a lot.
But I had a wild idea that I couldn’t quite shake — what if I went out this year? Obviously, I hadn’t built that kind of relationship with anyone, but that wasn’t the point. What if I went out with a complete stranger? What if we acted like we had a long history together? What if we LARPed it?
People generally think of Live Action Role Playing as anemic nerds running around parks in costumes throwing bags of birdseed at each other, but in the early 2000s, performance artists started using it too. They LARPed self-help conferences — learning how to self-actualize as someone else. Word on the street was that exploring the depths of a fake person really opened people up to themselves.
My idea was that making up a persona and a joint history with this person might teach me something about romantic scenarios, how I remember romance. It also played on dating app fears of being catfished, being played or being abducted by some suave psycho. If we both knew we were LARPing, if we were both lying but never trying to gauge the other’s honesty, how would that change the dating experience? How does that change me?
I wasn’t confident I’d be able to pull it off — who would agree to go out with some girl they’d never met on Valentine’s Day, let alone do it all as some elaborate game? I had a Tinder boy in mind, but when I asked him he said he had just started seeing someone. I thought about taking a friend but that didn’t seem like it fit the concept. So I gave up on it, left it for another year.
I’ll spare you the formulaic “but then” statement and just say I figured it out; I found someone mostly by accident, a contact from an old art project. He was excited about the idea and wanted to go to the Museum of Jurassic Technology to have a fake historic backdrop for our blossoming fake history. I was excited to have such an enthusiastic partner and he didn’t let me down. He was prompt and intelligent, witty and lighthearted. We shared a lot of the same interests, or what interests were readily apparent through the whimsical and exaggerated twists our stories took.
But for whatever reason, sitting in a small theater at the museum, I found myself missing the last guy instead. I’m not sure if I’m idealizing my last flame — he was a terrible museum date — but I was definitely more immediately taken with him than my LARP partner. We had gotten very intimate very quickly. I do wonder if the LARP prevented me from feeling close to this new person or if it’s just not as easy to find a suitable partner as I thought.
Either way, it was hard not to call the former flame — he would have been an incredible LARP partner. Valentine’s Day was the only thing holding me back — it was too loaded a day to call someone whose fatal flaw was seriousness. It’s funny how it’s so much harder to let go of someone you broke up with, knowing you’re the one who changed everything, rather than accepting a change someone else made. I was done with the last guy that broke up with me in a couple weeks and I had been really attached to him for six months. I never missed him like this. I don’t know, maybe I just liked this last guy more than I thought. That I didn’t realize that until now, I think that’s what hurts more than anything.

Knead & Co. has arrived at Grand Central Market, bringing fresh pastas, artisan olive oils and the chance to watch the magic of pasta being created. The historic food court on South Broadway in downtown Los Angeles is becoming more and more popular.
Following the success of brunch hotspot Eggslut, more restaurateurs have been flocking to Grand Central Market for its trendy vibes and good reputation. Now featuring Thai food, various Mexican food options, McConnell’s ice cream, and even vegan ramen restaurant Ramen Hood, Knead & Co. is in good company, and offers something everyone seems to crave: carbohydrates.
Knead & Co is a joint venture by Bruce Kalman and Marie Petulla, who also maintain Union Restaurant in Pasadena. According to The Los Angeles Times, the 720-square foot space offers a menu that is rooted in Italian, New Jersey and Californian traditions. Not only do they offer 11 different pasta dishes, but they also have salads, paninis, traditional Italian desserts like tiramisu, cannoli and zeppoles. All pastas are made onsite; the space features a windowed workshop where you can watch the chefs make pasta. With bar seating that faces the window, there is ample opportunity to observe the pasta-making process as it continues throughout the day.
Not only is Knead & Co. a sit-down restaurant, but it also sells its fresh pasta to take home, in addition to various other artisanal products, including olive oils, cheese and cultured butter.
The food itself is remarkably delicious. Best known for its classic Sunday Gravy spaghetti and meatballs (which, at 14 dollars, offers a very generous portion), the menu also features a squid tagliolini, porcini lasagnette (ribboned strands of pasta) and duck agnolotti (stuffed pasta). For those feeling a little less adventurous, there is always “maccheroni & cheese” or simple spaghetti with tomato sauce.
The Sunday Gravy spaghetti and meatballs is very rich, but is definitely  worth trying. Large pork meatballs are served in a homemade beef and pork ragout that is simmered favorably, resulting in tender meat that is exceptionally flavorful.
The sauce’s name derives from the tomato sauce that Italians would make every Sunday and is a delicious version of a classic. Seasoned with fresh parsley and basil, grated fresh parmesan and a dash of olive oil, there is a light quality to the sauce. However, it is a little lost under the rich flavors of the meat and perhaps a tad too salty
The pasta itself is just as tasty. Unfortunately, for anyone wishing to recreate the iconic scene from Lady and the Tramp, the spaghetti has a small hole in the middle that makes slurping the noodles almost impossible. That being said, the freshness of the pasta is definitely noticeable and is a cut above anything one could find at Ralphs.
In addition, the staff wears t-shirts that say “What’s your spirit noodle?” With eight different types of fresh pasta, the decision is definitely a personal one.
Head down to 317 S. Broadway and discover which type of pasta is the perfect match. Knead & Co. is open Sunday to Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Thursday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Kate Guarino | Daily Trojan
Hello from the other side … of the pond. This spring, I’ve joined the ranks of thousands of students studying abroad in London. But rather than recount my travels through the land that brought us wonders like Adele and Kate Middleton, I thought I’d make my first post about the study part of the abroad experience which has proved quite interesting in my first few weeks here. 
Part of the reason I applied to the program at City University of London was because I wanted to be a more informed global citizen, to better understand the world around me and the people living in it. USC prides itself on being one of America’s most diverse universities, but discussions of international politics and policy conflicts often seem abstract and distant. Students are more likely to be spotted covering a red carpet event than the refugee crisis.
A common thread of my classes this semester is discussion of conflict. But unlike at USC, at City the conflicts we discuss are not half a world away.  When my professor mentions the Balfour Declaration, I glance at the student sitting behind me who has identified himself as a Palestinian living in Israeli occupied territory. For him the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a part of everyday life. For the girl from Northern Ireland sitting behind me, the Good Friday Agreements are more than just words on a PowerPoint slide.
That’s not to say that I think American students are less sympathetic to international conflict, however, geography creates a boundary that provides a good excuse not to think about it.  Europe is smaller and less isolated. The ripples of conflict — whether it be the number of Syrian refugees flooding across borders or the prospect that the United Kingdom might leave the European Union — are more pronounced.
I’ve learned the most here by being attuned to what my classmates are saying. Maybe I’ve become a better listener or I’m just more interested. Whatever the case, what I’ve taken away from the experience is a reminder that whether in London or Los Angeles it’s important to think critically about conflicts and the people affected by them. Whenever possible, surround yourself with those people who force you to challenge and maybe even change your thinking. 
Distance shouldn’t be an excuse for apathy. My European classmates discuss “feeling the Bern,” Hillary Clinton’s emails and the absurdity of Donald Trump just as much as the students back home. But, I rarely if ever hear an American friend mention Prime Minister David Cameron or even Queen Elizabeth. You don’t have to be a politically minded-student to arm yourself with a basic knowledge of what is going on around you. As I write this the two girls next to me are talking about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. In the modern world where technology makes us more interconnected than ever before, students here seem to have a better understanding that nothing happens in a vacuum.  
If students here take the time to inform themselves about what is happening in America, American students should do students in other countries the same courtesy. Here’s to hoping that my semester-long taste of an international perspective stays with me for the long haul.

(*LinkedIn’s words, not mine.)
This past summer I had the pleasure of attending LinkedIn Festival: A Non-Technical Hackathon at the social networking service’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. Although I was there specifically to develop an idea that would promote employee engagement, I ended up talking with many LinkedIn employees who were staffing the weekend event about the website’s nuances and picked up some tips. If you’re still looking for an internship or your first full-time job, these little changes could help you build a profile that will stand out.
First impressions matter.
Your headline is an opportunity to create a slogan for yourself that others will use to make the decision as to whether to find out more or not. It is important to not only include what you do, but also add where you do it to give more interesting context, ultimately leading to what catches a hiring manager’s eye. 
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Secondly, adding a profile picture humanizes you. It’s hard to imagine a gray outline working alongside you, but I can definitely picture saying hi to Joseph in the office. Coincidentally, profiles with pictures actually get 14 times more views than those without.
Personalize it.
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Every LinkedIn profile comes with a unique URL but it may be an unintelligible string of characters to begin with. Not only will customizing your URL be easier on the eyes when including it in an email signature or on a business card, but it will also help with search engine optimization (SEO).
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Another way to personalize your profile is by adding a background. The possibilities of what you could use to stand out from the millions of gray profiles are endless, but some safe ideas are a picture of your favorite city, a solid block of your favorite color or something related to a professional interest of yours. The Muse has a collection of good ones to help you get inspired. 
Show, don’t just tell.
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Lastly, make the effort to include links to your best work. If they’re not already available somewhere online, you can upload presentations to SlideShare, video projects to Vimeo, or articles you’ve written to the Pulse. Not only will this send traffic to your other online profiles, but also you’ll be presenting a more complete picture of what you’re capable of accomplishing.

I’m ready for a LinkedIn makeover!
