People sipped horchata and snacked on de la Rosa marzipan candies as they bobbed their heads to the young local musicians on stage at With Love Market & Cafe last Thursday night. The event, Vibras pa la Cultura, did justice to its title, serving good vibes and spreading Latinx culture to a diverse audience: young and old, Spanish-speaking and not, student and local.
I feel so lucky to have helped plan this event. As a music industry minor, I am currently taking a class on live music production and promotion. The final project requires students to produce a show from start to finish (which still seems so crazy to me — I can’t believe I go to school for this!). From booking a venue to finding artists to marketing the event, in hopes of selling enough tickets to break even and donate the profits to charity, my group, Hermanas Vibras, had major work cut out for us.
Taking this class has been an absolute dream. While I’ve been an active audience member and photographer in the Los Angeles music scene, I’ve only just started booking shows. Having this opportunity to do what I do for fun on a larger scale has been a tremendous learning experience that I can see myself using throughout my life, whether for my career or as a passion project to promote diversity and safe environments in the music world. Even as a class assignment, the process was fun rather than overly academic.
Latinx representation was our top priority. Of the five members in my group, three speak Spanish and two are Latinx. Besides this personal connection, my group also recognized USC’s position in South L.A., a region with a predominantly Hispanic and Latinx population. There exists a divide between USC students and the local community, which we wanted to close.
With Love, a common study spot for Trojans, acted as both the venue hosting and the charity benefiting from our event. As a grocery store, cafe and nonprofit that hosts free classes about topics like healthy eating and yoga, we saw the cafe and market as the perfect fit for our show’s goals to unite and give back to the South L.A. community. Our diverse audience indicated our achievement of these goals.
First, junior psychology and popular music performance major Mariah Quintero warmed up the crowd with her powerhouse vocals. While I sat outside selling tickets and checking people in, multiple people walking by the venue slowed down their pace and peered in the window to listen to her belting. Clearly, Quinetero is captivating. Passersbys don’t even have to be in the same room as her to appreciate her voice! She has an elegant yet brassy sound, like a Latina pop princess.
Next was the local reggaeton artist Lalo, who quite literally moved the crowd with his Latin beats. He performed songs from “Mienteme,” meaning “lie to me,” a project he released in February. His track “SoLa” captivated me and my friends in the crowd. At the end of Lalo’s set, Alex Ricci, one of the other show headliners, joined him on stage, performing with Lalo and giving the audience a taste of how Ricci would entertain the crowd later in the night. 
Hannah Abrahim, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, took the stage next. Whether she was playing covers or originals, Abrahim incorporated her own rich, soulful vocals into the music. Fusing together pop and R&B, her persona and music gave the Kehlani-types of the world a run for their money. She moved with grace and strength as she sang, making the stage her home and her comfort zone.
Latin pop artist Alex Ricci closed the show, spreading peppy energy to the whole crowd. His music moved me to dance while working the food table. I couldn’t help it; I felt it in my corazón. The artist transformed first-time listeners into fans as he invited the audience to join in on the chorus of one of his tracks. His latest single, “El Muerto,” will definitely be added to my party playlist. 
When I watched my friends’ bands perform in high school, they were usually the only people of color; they shared the stage mostly with white boys. Since I’ve started booking my own shows in college, representation and diversity across a lineup have become top priorities for me. Having the chance to uplift the Latinx community in an artistic space was so rewarding. And, although the performers all shared that heritage, the bill was not homogeneous, as it included men and women with different musical styles and flare. 
I encourage USC students to bond with the South L.A. community surrounding our campus far more than we do already. Often, we only interact in passing, at stores or on the sidewalk. But I believe college feels like less of a bubble and more like an integrated part of a city when we choose to bridge the gap, transforming students into community members instead of keeping those titles separate. Vibras pa la Cultura did exactly this, and it was rewarding.
In the meantime, keep an eye out for more local shows, whether from this class or otherwise. Support diverse talent in your school or geographical community. Trust me, it feels incredible to brag about artists in close proximity to you.

Shoelaces, insoles, dyes, adhesives and leather preservatives cover the walls of the Village Cobbler. Owner Sean Keklikyan sits behind the counter, hunched over a pair of scuffed suede boots. He has mended heels, fixed soles and repatched leather at the shop for more than 10 years since the shop’s founding over three decades ago. 
Rows of boots, tennis shoes, heels and loafers line the shelves behind the counter. Smells of leather, metal and chemicals waft through the room. Hanging on the wall, a handmade wooden plaque reads “God Bless This Business” and a large sapphire evil eye stares at customers. There’s a used horseshoe, facing upward, symbolizing the invitation of good business. 
Keklikyan has owned the Village Cobbler since he took it over from his retiring uncle in 2010, 10 years after immigrating to the United States from Armenia, carrying it over from the old village to USC Village, which was built by the University in 2017. Taking after his uncles, grandfathers and father, who were all shoemakers hailing from Yerevan, Armenia — the historic epicenter of leather manufacturing — Keklikyan hopes to continue the cultural tradition of shoemaking for years to come. 
Keklikyan grew up watching his father work and would often help him resole, shine and repair shoes when he was a teenager. He remembers the cuts on his hands that would throb for weeks from his early mistakes with the knife and tools. During his childhood, almost every pair of his shoes was custom-made for him by his father. At 17, he once begged his father to make him cowboy boots, which were trendy at the time yet seemingly impossible to create. 
“We bought the leather, all the models [and] created the cowboy boots,” Keklikyan said. “Honestly, it was killing my feet, but I didn’t care. The most important thing for the cowboy boots on the side was the stitching design … Everything was real leather — inside, outside, leather sole, double stitching.”
Preserving Tradition 
Armenian tradition places historical and cultural significance on the art of shoemaking. Situated in the crossing of transit trade roads, Armenia was known for developing talented crafters, who created inner soles of shoes from oxen and bullocks and an outer layer of leather from cows. 
Despite the deep-rooted tradition of shoemaking in Keklikyan’s family and home country, he didn’t always expect to become a cobbler. In his youth, Keklikyan played on the Armenian national volleyball team and originally thought he would become a coach someday. 
However, Keklikyan stood on the shoulders of shoemaking giants. Strangers would often tell him about the shoemaking skills of his grandfathers. So the legacy followed him when he moved to Los Angeles, and he found himself helping his uncle.
“I guess I love shoes … When I see nice shoes, nice job, it’s like an art, like drawing a picture,” he said. “People love it … It’s in my blood.” 
Keklikyan is adamant that, despite the abundance of do-it-yourself videos, professional assistance is required to properly repair leather. When Keklikyan doesn’t know how to fix something, he will call friends who are cobblers. Despite his expertise, it’s nevertheless difficult to completely renew customers’ items. 
Recently, a customer brought in a 50-year-old vintage designer purse that she inherited from her mother. The purse was difficult to repair because the inside leather was deteriorating, making it nearly impossible to replicate its color and texture. Keklikyan explained that repairing the purse would change its authentic look and would be challenging, but not impossible. The customer later decided they didn’t want to lose its character.
“Honestly, it’s hard because sometimes they bring something like old purses, old shoes and they love their shoes,” he said. “They want to just keep them. You’ve got to do your best to satisfy the customer. It’s not going to be brand new, of course, but the condition is going to be much better.” 
Sole Survivor 
When USC opened the gates to USC Village in August 2017, it promised to expand housing, dining and other amenities for students. USC Village, which was the largest development in the school’s history, is home to big businesses such as Starbucks, Target and Trader Joe’s.
But before the upscale $700 million, 15-acre complex existed, there was another village; the old University Village, which dated back to the 1970s and housed local businesses, none of which are still open except for Village Cobbler. Keklikyan admits that, although the transition period was difficult, the current location is better for business. 
“Definitely now it’s better because everything is new — new stores, lots of students are here now,” Keklikyan said. 
The establishment of USC Village is part of the larger trend of gentrification around USC’s campus. Many local businesses were pushed out to create the development and residents were driven out of their homes.
“I think that when USC turned over [USC Village], they really tried to gear things toward students rather than the surrounding community,” said Lucy Santora, a senior majoring in international relations and public diplomacy who has frequented Village Cobbler to fix her shoes and bags. “But, I think that the role of the Cobbler works well with the surrounding community and USC students … That whole turnover is an interesting study of gentrification, but I’m very thankful that the Cobbler is still a part of USC Village.”
Yet in a profession that continues to dwindle in the United States, other cobblers have not been as lucky as Keklikyan. According to the Shoe Service Institute of America, shoe repair shops have decreased from 100,000 in the 1930s to 5,000 in 2019. While fast fashion proliferates, Keklikyan has made it clear that he is not leaving any time soon. 
“This business [has] been here for a long time,” he said. “Everybody knows this business, they know the Village Cobbler. I didn’t even change the name because this name was popular already, and I don’t want to lose that.”
Building Community 
When Kelikyan took over the business, it was difficult for him to establish a new clientele that knew him, not his uncle, as the face of the Village Cobbler. He enjoyed working with his uncle when he could and appreciates the loyalty of his former customers. 
“All of my customers, even until now, they remember him,” Keklikyan said. “They love him. So they always stop by [and] say like, ‘How’s John doing?’”  
Keklikyan’s service has driven significant customer engagement, even in nonbusiness matters. Alumni who have moved to the East Coast still send their shoes to him. A customer recently called him to weigh in on an argument about whether boots qualify as shoes. Customers drive from Long Beach, Orange County and Irvine for his expertise. 
“It’s about the quality, about the service,” Keklikyan said. “That all matters when you are doing not only this business, but any business.” 
Many students, including Santora, have had a continued history with Keklikyan’s shop. Santora’s first time going to the Village Cobbler was after her backpack handle broke off in her sophomore year, which Keklikyan fixed the same day. 
“I have gone to get shoes resoled, some of my shoes for work, literally whatever you need, he can do, which is really awesome,” she said. 
Santora appreciates Keklikyan’s friendliness and knowledge. She said he pays attention to detail and clearly communicates to customers how he plans on fixing whatever item they bring. 
“He’s a very nice guy, and he’s definitely community-driven and really just wants to be there and hear about your time at USC,” she said. 
Jenny Zhu, a senior studying economics, said she enjoys Keklikyan’s service and would recommend the business to any students. 
“He was very reasonable,” Zhu said. “He did not want to take advantage of me being a student and having the convenience.”
Zhu said the Cobbler stands out among more corporate retail businesses in USC Village. The shop is only run by Keklikyan and it doesn’t have a website.
“This is definitely more handiwork,” Zhu said. “But I thought that it was very convenient for him to be there because if he wasn’t there at USC Village, then I would’ve gone on Yelp to find somewhere in downtown potentially to get my shoe fixed.” 
For Keklikyan, who went to college in Armenia, working in USC Village surrounded by students is a way to give back. It is this giving that truly drives his business and has allowed the Village Cobbler to stick around for nearly 30 years. 
“It’s honestly a nice place and location for business,” Keklikyan said. “I’ve been a student too — in front of [my] the university [there were] lots of shops and restaurants that I used. Now, I’m kind of giving that service they gave me when I was in the young ages.”

College students are no strangers to having to ration their time and energy between multiple pursuits. Between classes, work, extracurriculars and social activities, college is a stressful balancing act. However, a certain student population within colleges deals with an additional pressure: parents. 
According to data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, more than one in five undergraduate college students are parents. Single mothers represent more than two in five of these student parents. While there are no statistics on undergraduate student parents at USC, the University should work to provide sufficient childcare support to facilitate an environment where these students can focus on their studies while raising children.
The USC Engemann Student Health Center currently offers sexual and reproductive health care services, including birth control prescription, contraceptive insertion and a “full range” of consultation services. In 2019, USC Student Health and USC Pharmacy partnered to set up a wellness-to-go machine in the King Hall lobby that functions like a vending machine, stocked with contraceptive devices and pregnancy tests among other over-the-counter pharmaceutical products.
Both the services that Engemann offers and the wellness-to-go machine offer sufficient means to prevent unwanted pregnancies. However, they do not address the needs of students who already have children.
USC provides childcare for its staff, faculty and students at Bright Horizons at University Park, the University’s child development center. Bright Horizons serves children from the age of six weeks to five years. The center, which operates from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, takes a lot of burden off of student parents. 
However, the full-time tuition rate at Bright Horizons ranges from $1,118 to $1,522 depending on the child’s age. The average monthly cost of infant care in California is $1,412, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Especially because student parents are shouldering the cost of their own tuition and may not have entered the workforce yet, USC should strive to offer childcare at a lower rate.
If lower rates cannot be achieved immediately, the University should better advertise the Childcare Subsidy Grants Program, through which the USC Graduate Student Government gives out a limited amount of financial aid to graduate student parents who need assistance with paying for childcare. The aid packages, which total to $1,400, are awarded each semester. While it is unclear from the website how many awards are given out each semester, eliminating or decreasing the cost of childcare through grants is a great way for the University to support student parents. The University should consider extending the grant to include undergraduate student parents who may have similar financial needs. In addition, the University should consider further easing the financial strain on student parents by adding grants that can be used for other child-raising necessities including health care.
USC could also provide classes online for parents of children who are under the age that Bright Horizons cares for. Having online courses allows for greater flexibility of scheduling and allows student parents to engage in schoolwork from their own homes, leaving more time to spend with their newborn children. Similarly, online classes may also decrease the likelihood that the student will fall behind on coursework while caring for their child.
Parenting seminars may also be a good resource for new student parents. At UC Berkeley, students can learn important skills such as breastfeeding through a no-cost program sponsored by Health Services. This will not only teach student parents how to navigate parenthood but also connect student parents with each other and form a community. 
Student parents are an often invisible yet valuable population at USC. With stronger advertising of existing support services and creating new ones, the University can help ensure that parenthood does not interfere with students’ academic lives and, equally important, that students’ academic lives do not interfere with parenthood.

USC requires that students take both WRIT 150 and WRIT 340 to graduate. These general education writing classes help develop students’ college level essay-writing skills and prepare them for any professional writing they may encounter in the workforce. 
WRIT 340 teaches students skills such as technical writing for specific professions, how to write critically about humanities and the arts and how to write cover letters for job applications. However, they lack options for those pursuing creative careers or professions outside of law or STEM. 
The program should be expanded to include a creative writing option for WRIT 340. While sections such as “Advanced Writing for Pre-Law Students” or “Advanced Writing for Natural Sciences” are helpful for students seeking careers in those specific professions, a creative writing option would give students who would not otherwise have the opportunity an avenue to express themselves. 
Right now, students outside of the creative writing or screenwriting programs have little access to creative writing classes. While there is one creative writing class for nonmajors, all other classes, such as “Introduction to Fiction Writing” and “Introduction to Poetry Writing,” are only open to English majors with creative writing emphases. Even other students in the English department have difficulty signing up for those classes, and they are usually restricted to only the introductory courses. Adding a creative writing course that is open to all while also satisfying a general education requirement would make the subject more accessible to a wider group of students.
Adding this substitution to WRIT 340 would not undermine the course’s rigor. On the Dornsife Writing Program’s website, the course description explains that WRIT 340 “encourages students to, among other things, engage with the ethical issues that accompany their respective disciplines and the vocations to which these may lead.” There’s no reason that students could not explore ethical issues through creative writing. The writing does not have to only be narrative fiction — students could write in other formats like memoir, screenplay or poetry. These classes would be valuable to both seasoned writers and those who may not have had a way to express themselves creatively. 
In an article for the UC Berkeley Greater Good Magazine, creative writing consultant Laura Bean argues that creative writing classes allow students to tell their own stories to their peers, aiding their growth as individuals. Students may find it difficult to express these feelings in WRIT 340 sections, which are exclusively focused on professional writing. Creative writing classes not only help people articulate their thoughts but also help individuals focus on personal growth and better examine their lives.
Creative writing courses also help students develop unique skills that may not have been taught in essay writing courses. In an article for The Atlantic, Rebecca Wallace-Segall, a creative writing educator, emphasized the impact of fiction on our society as a whole, saying that it is the most marketable and accessible way for people to convey ideas. She adds that these classes encourage students to engage in dialogues around social issues through the lens of creative fiction. 
These styles of writing may not directly connect to careers that students wish to pursue, but they can help students engage with issues they may not have discussed in other classes. While not all students may respond to creative writing classes, giving students the options to take such courses could help the next generation’s writers and global citizens find their voices.
While the class does have an emphasis on preparing students for the workforce, not all students will go into a field that requires professional, formal writing. For those entering creative careers, this course would be an avenue to get professional training not offered in other WRIT 340 courses. 
College is also a time for exploration, and adding a creative writing option could help students realize their passion for forms of writing other than essays. Even if these classes don’t produce the next great fiction author, they could help students break up the monotony of essay writing and perhaps reignite their interest in writing in general.

Students are encouraged to refrain from returning to USC through April 13 should they leave campus during spring break, following the University’s decision to extend remote instruction to April 14, Provost Charles Zukoski announced in a schoolwide email Wednesday. USC has announced this move alongside other universities around the country that continue to move online to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. 
USC asked students to leave University-owned housing for spring break and not return for the next month, Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan; however, the University has not yet announced an exact move-out date. USC will allow students to remain in their current living spaces after they notify USC Housing, the University said. This accommodation is intended for students who are unable to return home, including those who are affected by travel restrictions, and students experiencing homelessness.
“There are lots of caveats there that we have to work on because there are many students who have nowhere to go,” Zukoski told the Daily Trojan. “International students have nowhere to go, and so we will have dorms that are open.”
According to Zukoski, online instruction may be extended through the end of the semester. USC will continue to monitor the situation as it develops. 
“We’re encouraging all students — in fact, we’re telling all students who can leave — that we would like them out of the dorms,” Zukoski said in the interview. 
Apurvi Bhartia, a sophomore majoring in economics, said she wanted the administration to tell international students what to do in case they went home and were unable to return to the U.S.  
“I want the administration to specifically adjust what international students should do in this case,” Bhartia said. “Just not knowing what’s going to happen in the next one week, especially where [I am] going to live, and in case I’m going back and not coming [back].That means that I have to move out right now. Moving out right now means taking all my stuff and putting it in storage … I don’t even have flight tickets booked. I think the whole atmosphere is that of anxiety.”
This update follows Tuesday’s announcement that classes would remain online through March 29 following spring break — a period that has now been extended by two weeks. Students are currently undergoing a three-day trial meant to ease the transition to online classes. Faculty and administrators will evaluate the digital procedures over spring break and adjust accordingly.
The extended period of remote instruction is an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus by reducing the number of people on campus who may transmit the illness, Zukoski said. 
“All of our decisions are intended to ensure the health and safety of our USC and broader community, especially in light of the World Health Organization’s announcement today classifying COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic,” the email read. “Please note that these dates may be adjusted again as circumstances change and if so, we will do everything we can to give you as much notice as possible.”
Vicky Ma, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said the new policy was a good preventative measure, but unless USC found a way to monitor students, they would be unable to keep track of those who traveled to other places. 
“I think it’s a good way to protect students but it is kind of tricky, because [the] school won’t know who [will] go to other places and come back,” Ma said. “I think that’s a problem. I feel like they need to find a way to monitor the students.” 
Erin Moore, a professor of anthropology, said professors received the email announcing the extension of classes at the same time as the rest of the community. However, she said the University has kept the community updated by sending emails every hour regarding safety, training and coronavirus updates. 
“I, as a faculty member, get once an hour or more …  a new communiqué from the University,” Moore said. “I think as fast as they’re finding out information, they’re passing it on.”
The University is making adjustments as necessary as circumstances continue to change. USC said it will release more information in the next 24 hours.

The NCAA will hold its upcoming championship tournaments, including the men’s and women’s March Madness basketball tournaments, without fans in attendance in response to the coronavirus pandemic and to prevent further spread of the virus, the organization announced Wednesday. The Pac-12 Conference followed suit a few hours later by banning fans from the men’s basketball Pac-12 Tournament.
NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement that the NCAA Tournaments will still take place but that attendance will be limited to family and essential staff and personnel. Games will still be televised as originally planned, but the NCAA is still working to determine the extent to which other media will be allowed into the venues.
“While I understand how disappointing this is for all of our fans, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,” Emmert said in the statement. “This decision is in the best interest of public health, including that of coaches, administrators, fans and, most importantly, our student-athletes.”
Emmert said the decision was advised by public health officials and the NCAA’s COVID-19 advisory panel and was reached after discussion with the NCAA Board of Governors. 
The Pac-12 Conference released a statement Tuesday announcing that fans would be in attendance  at the conference tournament in Las Vegas and that increased hygiene measures would be taken, including increased access to hand sanitizer around T-Mobile Arena and frequent disinfectant and cleaning procedures throughout the stadium.
But after the NCAA’s decision, the conference decided to not allow fans to attend the tournament, according to a Pac-12 statement later Wednesday.
“While we understand the disruption this will cause to our many fans, we have made this decision in an effort to do our part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and in the interest of the health and safety of our student-athletes, campus communities, working and volunteer event personnel and all those who attend Pac-12 events,” the statement read.
The USC men’s basketball team is expected to earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament this Selection Sunday, which will be the team’s first March Madness appearance since 2017. 
“I just think everybody’s going to be depressed,” senior forward Nick Rakocevic said, according to Ben Bolch of the Los Angeles Times. “It’s just going to be a different mentality for people, it’s just going to be not as fun. I don’t think guys are going to be as juiced up to play.”
Senior guard Jonah Mathews added that the NCAA Tournament will feel similar to practice without fans in attendance.
“We recognize the opportunity to compete in an NCAA national championship is an experience of a lifetime for the students and their families,” the statement read. “Today, we will move forward and conduct championships consistent with the current information and will continue to monitor and make adjustments as needed.”
More than 1,000 people in 41 different states have tested positive for coronavirus as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the New York Times, but the number of cases in the United States is estimated to be much higher. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic Wednesday.
USC Athletics banned fan attendance at all home games from Wednesday through March 29 in response to the spread of the virus, according to a statement sent Tuesday.

President-elect Truman Fritz announced the appointment of  International Student Assembly director Jina Hur as the interim senior director of programming and as next year’s chief programming officer at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting Tuesday. 
Former Senior Director of Programming Montana Houston was removed from her position last week after several USG programming assemblies sent a joint statement to the executive cabinet with formal complaints on Houston violating USG policy with her amendment proposal to change the incorporation of new assemblies under the programming branch. 
The original bylaw proposed in February allowed organizations to become cultural assemblies if they provided either a petition with 50 undergraduate signatures or the signatures of five member organization presidents. Her proposal would remove the option for an undergraduate petition. 
Hur was selected following her previous experience in USG as ISA director and will hold the position until May 15 for Stone and Tahsin’s last two weeks and overseeing the incoming administration’s programming. 
“Her role on the [executive board] is to serve and advise functional programming, and making sure that is stable for the remainder of the year, and [oversee] the transition between the old and new [executive boards],” President Trenton Stone said. 
Later in the meeting, Sen. Randi Anderson presented updates on her efforts to help the Thornton School of Music be more sustainable. 
Anderson said she wants to encourage Thornton to take steps towards reducing paper waste, through methods of digitizing readers and doing homework assignments online. 
“Since I’m a student in Thornton, I see the amount of paper waste that’s going in landfills every day,” Anderson said. “I figured it’s close to home, I know a lot of people, I’ve talked to professors a lot and I just think that something needed to change because I know that we, specifically, have a really big carbon footprint in the University.”
Anderson has been in communication with senior lecturer Chris Rozé, associate professor Cristian Grases and Dean Robert Cutietta, who plans on sending an email to Thornton faculty with information on decreasing the school’s paper waste. 
She said she hopes to expand the initiative to the wider University community. 
“Just because I’m not going to be a senator next year doesn’t mean that I’m not going to keep working on this,” Anderson said. “I’m going to continue to do everything that I can to push it outward as much as possible.” 
Anderson also talked about attending a meeting about the creation of an on-campus LGBTQ resource center for victims of sexual assault last month. A grant is being finalized for the center’s creation during the next school year. She said she hopes to create a social media liaison position within the center to help promote its resources. 
“I’m trying to get the social media liaison position entered into the grant so when it’s all unfolding, that doesn’t get swept under the table,” Anderson said. “A lot of really good resources exist for students already, but students don’t know about them or have access to them because of the lack of knowledge, so I just thought that would be really important.” 
Sen. Angela Chuang gave updates on her work relating to transfer student housing. 
She found that at Portland Street House, 99% of the 44 residents are transfer students. Chuang plans to meet with Portland Street Housing and hopes to have USC Housing officially deem this location as housing specifically for transfer students. 
“We’ve been talking about how we can make it official transfer student housing because even though they house the majority, it’s still not technically official transfer student housing,” Chuang said. 
Chuang, along with her senate aide Mackenzie Biles and Sen. Emily Johnson, has also been working on drafting a proposal to present to Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp on professional fraternities being recognized on campus. In her last presentation, Chuang mentioned that professional fraternities did not have a source of central representation and was working to create a professional fraternity council. 
“[Professional fraternity recognition] is something that I’ve been wanting to do since last school year and for a while, we were getting told that it wasn’t going to happen, but [the Campus Activities Office] recently said that we could try to see if [Crisp] would be on board with it,” Chuang said. “Hopefully, we’ll have this done soon to show him.” 
Chuang also mentioned her work with Sens. Johnson, Omar Garcia and Christopher McMorran on voicing support for the UC-wide cost-of-living adjustment movement. Graduate students at UC Santa Cruz are currently on an indefinite strike in response to rent burdens as they ask for an adjustment to their salaries for high costs of living. Chuang has been in communication with a student government senator from UC Santa Barbara who authored a resolution in support. 
“As the Undergraduate Student Government, I know that [the Graduate Student Government’s] executive cabinet, with USG’s executive cabinet, recently released a statement on it, and we’re looking to produce our statement of support for those students as well,” Chuang said.  
The Senate also voted on and approved President-elect Truman Fritz’s choices for next year’s executive cabinet. Sen. Hailey Robertson was appointed chief of staff, discretionary fund co-director Mike Shao was appointed as treasurer and marketing director Olivia Frary was appointed senior director of communications.

Study abroad programs in countries with a Level 3 travel advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been canceled and University-sponsored travel is suspended in response to the spread of coronavirus, the University announced in a schoolwide email Tuesday.
Students currently enrolled in canceled study abroad programs have returned to the United States. University officials will evaluate the need for the self-quarantine of students returning from these programs based on CDC guidelines on each country. The University said it would continue to track circumstances in other countries where students are studying and make decisions about programs in Level 1 and 2 countries based on virus developments in each location.
“The university is closely monitoring the situation in other countries,” the email read. “Any students abroad who wish to return home voluntarily should contact their USC program advisor to discuss their academic continuation options.”
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism canceled all international summer programs, including its immersive reporting course in Ghana, the International Communication Studies program and international graduate internship programs in Berlin, Germany; Cape Town, South Africa; Hong Kong; and São Paulo, Brazil, the school announced in an email to Annenberg students Tuesday. Students enrolled in some of the programs, including the Maymester Ghana trip, received advance notification of the cancellation.
The University will suspend all nonessential domestic and international professional travel for graduate students, staff and faculty through March 29 and will require them to obtain written approval from their dean or supervisor to be reimbursed for costs associated with essential travel, the provost announced in the email Tuesday. 
Personal international travel during spring break is discouraged, and the University will follow CDC guidelines to enforce self-quarantines for students returning from both personal and academic travel, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman told the Daily Trojan. Currently, students returning from the Annenberg school’s study abroad program in Rome are self-quarantining for two weeks at the recommendation of public health officials.

Springfest has been canceled due to concerns of the spread of coronavirus. The annual University-affiliated concert, hosted by USC Concerts Committee, was to be held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum March 28.
People who purchased guest passes and pre-ordered merchandise will receive refunds, the committee announced in a statement released on its Instagram Tuesday.
“In accordance with University policy, we are sad to announce that Springfest 2020 scheduled for March 28 is canceled due to concerns regarding COVID-19,” Concerts Committee said in the statement. “We are proud to take the health and safety of our students seriously, and are grateful to all our partners, artist teams, and the LA Memorial Coliseum for understanding.”
All on- and off-campus University-related events, excluding academic performances and intercollegiate games, will be canceled from March 11 to 29, according to an email sent by Provost Charles Zukoski to the USC community. Springfest, which has traditionally been held at McCarthy Quad, had been looking to shift its venue to the Coliseum since 2017 due to increased attendance. 
This year, Concerts Committee also announced Springfest would include an additional stage for student talent and guest ticketing for non-USC attendees, along with extending Fryft hours to accommodate student transportation to and from the venue.
Concerts Committee, which had not yet released a complete lineup of artists, announced earlier this month that student performers would include Kyle Lux, Ayoni, Ashes to Amber, Kid Hastings and Ayse. 
The headliner was never announced. However, in the past, Springfest featured headliners such as Diplo, Trippie Redd, 2 Chainz and Playboi Carti.
Springfest was previously canceled in 2017 during hip-hop trio Migos’ performance as McCarthy Quad exceeded capacity, leading to trampling, the involvement of the Los Angeles Fire Department and a student’s hospitalization. 
Co-directors of Concerts Committee Leila Kashfi and Chris Begler said they are actively looking to bring back programming to the community this semester, should the circumstances change. Kashfi and Begler said the committee will redirect the Springfest budget to another program if University policy allows.

Two weeks ago, I wrote a column with the headline ‘Politics in America looks like the Astros.’ In the column, I wrote a lot about Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, a little about President Donald Trump, and concluded that in light of the parallels between the two schmucks’ feckless behavior, America’s pastime and America’s nightmare look similar right now. 
In response, I received the following message from a reader: “Sports and politics do not intersect in or out of your article.” 
I cannot adequately express how baffled I was at this response. Yes — the degree to which I was taken off- guard surpassed shock, took a detour at confusion and found a home at the hyperbolic state of sheer bafflement. Not since the results of my last economics final have I felt so utterly perplexed at someone’s response to my work. 
However, for many Americans, and apparently the aforementioned reader, this opinion does not elicit bafflement but is instead an accepted fact of life. For many readers from this subset of American society, the idea that sports and politics don’t mix is just as tried-and-true as other classics such as ‘Minorities are too loud these days’ and ‘Don’t women already have enough rights?’ 
So, in a last-ditch effort to set the record straight on this issue before we all leave for spring break, I would like to make two arguments. First, sports does intersect with politics — quite often, actually — and second, this intersection serves a crucial function in American life. 
Now, seriously, does sports really intersect with American life?
To that I say yes, yes, a thousand times and forever, yes; and for evidence, please look no further than the nearest television or phone screen. In case you aren’t already painfully aware, coronavirus is here, and it’s not only at airports and cruise ships, but it might even be coming to a basketball stadium near you!
In a memo sent Saturday, the NBA asked each of its teams to have plans in place by Monday to handle the spread of the virus. The memo also recommended that teams’ traveling parties, which often include guests and support staff, be limited to “essential individuals only.” No plans have been made to cancel games yet, but the league is already asking teams to come up with contingency plans if one of them decides to ban spectators from games. 
That’s right, basketball’s greatest stars might be playing in front of a grand total of no one in the not-so-distant future! And it’s not only the NBA that’s taking notice of the implications of the virus’s spread but also the International Olympic Committee. The 2020 Olympics might be canceled, and if that alone doesn’t sound crazy enough for you, please consider that the games have only been canceled three times ever in their history, each time because of a World War. 
Also, if you’re about to come at me with the argument that coronavirus isn’t political because it’s a matter of public health and not political debate, please stop before you embarrass yourself. Yes, the virus was not formed by government policy, but its relentless spread might have been allowed by the failures of government policy. Also, who is supposed to be coordinating a national response to the pandemic? Bingo, it’s the Trump administration, which I believe is now reconsidering its political stance on vaccines!
This year, it’s coronavirus. Last year, it was a near-international crisis caused by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey. In 2018, the Winter Olympics nearly brought forth a period of detente between North and South Korea. Prior to that, we had Colin Kaepernick’s kneel-heard-round-the-world and LeBron’s ‘I Can’t Breathe’ T-shirt. 
Hell, if you still believe that sports and politics don’t intersect, just buy a ticket to an NFL game. Yes, those are military grade fighter jets roaring over your head right now. No, they are not legally obligated to do that. 
Don’t worry, hypothetical angry reader, I already hear your concern: “Of course sports and politics intersect, you lib-tard! That’s the biggest problem with sports nowadays. Also, where are the keys to my Ford Super Duty?”
This is where considering the purpose of sports is important. For some, sports is just a form of entertainment, an opportunity to escape from life’s many stressors. 
I happen to agree with that statement. Few things in my life have provided me with more joy than College Football Saturdays, and that joy is only heightened when it comes after a long day of studying. 
Sports do entertain, yes, but they are also a powerful unifying force in American life, one that brings together Americans of all different races, incomes, genders and generations for the shared enjoyment of rooting for the local team or simply watching the game. 
In the words of sports journalist Louisa Thomas, sports also unites Americans by conveying and shaping our shared understanding of competition and fair play. From a young age, sports teach us not to cheat, to work with our teammates and to respect the opposition. 
Politics transforms these values into real and effective policy, and it is for this reason that the intersection between sports and politics, whether brought on by calamity or Kaepernick, is not only undeniable but essential to understanding and improving American society.

While All-American senior midfielder Kerrigan Miller was interviewed after a morning practice at McAlister Field, her teammates lined up on the bench patiently waiting for her to finish up and join them. A loud thud rebounded off a wall, and Miller swiveled. 
Her teammate, senior midfielder Kaeli Huff, who has played alongside Miller since the fourth grade, was nursing her eye from the impact of a ricocheted shot. Only after inspecting the injury and ensuring Huff’s welfare did Miller tentatively return to answer more questions.
It was clear that the Bayport, N.Y. native was not only a remarkable player on the field but a loved one off of it.
“She does have such a balance,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “She’s a monster and she’s a beast, and she steps off [the field] and she’s super loving and caring and sweet.”
Now, leaning against her stick while keeping a side-eyed view on Huff, Miller turned her forearm outward to reveal the words “love you like crazy” inked beneath the crook of her left elbow. She told US Lacrosse Magazine that the tattoo is an homage to her family, in which the phrase has developed into a motto. It was thanks to her two older sisters, MacKenzie and Delaney, that Miller started playing lacrosse in the first place.
“[I] did everything they did,” Kerrigan said.
When a youth program arrived in their town, Kerrigan played on her sisters’ teams until she was able to join a team in her own age range. 
Years later, Miller’s younger sister, Maddigan, is committed to play lacrosse at Stanford next fall. Although Kerrigan is disappointed she neither gets to play against nor with her sister, she’s happy Maddigan is paving her own way.
“I really respect [my sister’s] decision to create her own path,” Miller said. “Hopefully, I’ll still be out here [next year] so we’ll be together, but I’m just super proud of her.”
Miller’s legacy on the West Coast is something to be both admired and feared. There’s a reason Just Women’s Sports predicted that upon her exit from college athletics, Miller will be remembered as one of the best West Coast lacrosse players of all time. 
The two-time Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year and last year’s Pac-12 Tournament Most Valuable Player was ILWomen’s No. 1-ranked recruit when she committed to USC in 2016. With her pick from a number of perennial powerhouse programs, including Maryland, North Carolina and Northwestern, Miller decided instead to spearhead the success of a newer program — USC — which was only in its fourth year as a Division I team. 
“I could’ve gone to a [more established program], but I kind of wanted to be a part of something more,” Miller said in a 2016 interview with Inside Lacrosse. “I thought there was that kind of opportunity for me at USC. The coaching staff was what I was so confident in, and I knew they could take a player and a group of girls and make them into the highest caliber of lacrosse players there are.” 
Four years and a Pac-12 Championship later, Miller had called it from the beginning. 
“[USC] has literally changed my life completely,” Miller said. “I’m so happy after four years that I came out here, despite it being so far away from home and it being a new program. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Each year I can feel myself growing from a player standpoint and as a person.”
One of Miller’s greatest points of growth as a player was learning to channel her intense emotions on the field. Her athletic prowess always shines brightest between the 30-yard lines, where the 5-foot-5 Miller is known for her ability to steal the ball out of competitors’ sticks and take it coast-to-coast. 
During the 2018 and 2019 seasons, Miller led the Pac-12 with 40 and 41 caused turnovers, respectively. While Munday says that these 50-50 hustle and heart plays define her as an athlete, her fervor has sometimes hindered her performance in the past.
“[It’s] her biggest strength, but also sometimes it holds you back because you’re so passionate and you’re so committed and you’re so emotionally invested,” Munday said. “So I think her managing her emotions and really channeling them, she’s really grown in that area. And I think I’ve seen it already this season where she’s made changes in-game when she’s kind of been emotional and she’s gotten out of that, and just focuses on the things that she can control.”
Her teammate Huff, now with a black ring around her left eye, said Miller’s passion is contagious.
“She just creates this team dynamic,” Huff said. “She talks to everybody right before practice and pumps everybody up. She definitely has projected her competitive spirit onto everyone else, and that’s helped us”.
Miller recently became the fifth Trojan to reach the 100-goal milestone during USC’s win over Michigan and was previosly added to the 2020 Tewaaraton Award Watch List, but she remains steadfastly team-oriented. 
“This program wants a national championship,” Miller said, smiling. “We have no problem saying that. That’s what we want to do.”
Under Kerrigan’s leadership and an attitude that balances both might and humility, the goal is certainly feasible. 
50-50 hustle and heart — that’s Kerrigan Miller in a nutshell.

The University of Southern California issued a statement Tuesday evening announcing new attendance protocols for home athletic events in response to developments related to coronavirus.
Starting Wednesday and continuing through March 29, nonessential spectators will not be allowed to attend home USC athletic events. Those allowed to attend games include team personnel, game officials, families of student athletes, potential recruits and media.
Game and practice schedules remain mostly unchanged and all home USC athletic events are set to continue as planned. Games will be televised and streamed as scheduled on the Pac-12 Networks and USC’s official athletics website despite the absence of fans in attendance.  
Spring football practices, which are scheduled to begin Wednesday, will also fall under these guidelines. Spring practices are traditionally open to fans for the entirety of the spring session, culminating in the annual Spring Showcase. The status of audiences allowed at the showcase remains the same for now. The event is still scheduled for April 11 at noon.  
All fans who have purchased tickets to the impacted events have been referred to the USC Ticket Office for questions or concerns. Uncertainty remains for those who have already purchased single- and multi-game ticket packages for impacted games. The office was closed and did not answer calls for comment before publication.
Three visiting teams had already announced the cancellation of scheduled contests in Los Angeles to play the Trojans. 
Harvard Men’s Volleyball announced Sunday that its three-game West Coast trip, which included visits to Malibu and Irvine along with a trip to USC Saturday, had been canceled. 
USC Women’s Lacrosse announced in a statement earlier Tuesday afternoon it had reached a joint agreement with Stony Brook Women’s Lacrosse to cancel their scheduled Sunday contest in an abundance of caution. 
USC Women’s Tennis also announced Monday the cancellation of a women’s tennis matchup with North Carolina State scheduled for Friday.
None of the cancellation announcements have included plans for rescheduling the impacted games. 
USC will continue all away travel for athletic events as originally scheduled and is prepared to make accommodations for team personnel who do not feel comfortable traveling to or participating in team activities. 
Despite there being no confirmed cases of coronavirus on the USC campus, athletics staff will continue to implement “enhanced cleaning measures and public hygiene practices” in campus athletic facilities, according to the statement.
