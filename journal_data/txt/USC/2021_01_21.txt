Miami developer Robert Zangrillo, accused of guaranteeing his daughter’s admission to USC through bribery and fraud, was pardoned by former President Donald Trump early Wednesday. Zangrillo is the only parent implicated in the college admissions scandal who has received a full pardon from his charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
Zangrillo, just one of the 11 USC parents entangled in Operation Varsity Blues, received a “full pardon” in the final hours of Trump’s presidency, according to a White House news release. Zangrillo allegedly paid $250,000 to secure his daughter’s admission to the University.
The news release acknowledged Zangrillo’s charge, but stated that Zangrillo’s “daughter did not have others take standardized tests for her” and was “currently earning a 3.9 GPA at the University of Southern California.” A University spokesperson confirmed that Zangrillo’s daughter is not currently enrolled, according to The New York Times.
The news release also stated that Zangrillo’s pardon was supported by Tom Barrack, a USC trustee since 2012. Barrack also served as the chairman of Trump’s inaugural committee and is a close friend of the departed president.
A spokesperson for Barrack told the Daily Trojan the trustee had no connection to Zangrillo’s pardon. 
“[Barrack] never intervened and never had discussion with anyone about it,” the spokesperson said in an email. “All reports to the contrary are patently false.”
Following Zangrillo’s daughter’s initial rejection to the University around 2017, investigators intercepted a conversation between him and William “Rick” Singer, a key middle man in the Varsity Blues scandal. According to court documents, Singer told Zangrillo he could secure his daughter’s admission to the University as an athletic recruit.
Prosecutors alleged Zangrillo sent $200,000 to Singer and $50,000 to USC’s Women’s Athletics. His daughter’s application also included a false record of completed classes — taken instead by Singer’s employee Mikaela Sanford — and a fabricated rowing commitment. 
In 2019, Zangrillo’s lawyers argued that Zangrillo’s payment was a legitimate donation to the University and could not be distinguished from the “vast numbers of other donations by parents of students made to USC,” according to a court filing. 
A USC media representative stated that no statement will be released on the issue.
Of the over 10 universities involved in the college admission scandal, USC had the highest number of high profile cases and students admitted through bribes. 
In May, “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer, Mossimo Giannulli, pled guilty to fraud, following accusations of paying $500,000 to ensure their daughters’ admission to the University as fake athletic recruits. Following months of denying involvement, Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison and Giannulli to five months. Loughlin was released in December, with Giannulli set to be released in April.
Three other USC parents — Devin Sloane, Jeffrey Bizzack and Agustin Huneeus Jr. — were sentenced to prison late 2019 after pleading guilty to their involvement in the college admissions scandal.

Green lines of code light up the screen as music by D-Nice plays in the background. Suddenly, colored television bars interrupt and the video transitions to a recording of a dark room with a mannequin lit by a projector. The voice of Miki Turner can be heard as she describes how she expected the coronavirus pandemic to be another “HIV epidemic” or “SARS thing.”
Turner, assistant professor of professional practice at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, represents just one of the many members of the USC community affected by the coronavirus pandemic. She shared her personal story by documenting it through Collecting COVID-19, an initiative set up by the USC Libraries’ Special Collections and University Archives during the spring 2020 semester. 
The initiative serves to document how members of the USC community, Los Angeles and the greater Southern California region have experienced the pandemic. In collaboration with USC Libraries, students from the School of Dramatic Arts looked into the archives and started a project of their own to present some experiences found in the collection, including that of Turner. This project, known as Hidden Stories, is meant to give anyone a glimpse of life during the pandemic through the lens of a “digital theatrical experience.”
Upon visiting the Hidden Stories website, visitors click the button “START HERE” to begin immersing themselves in the project. The first story, “Love or Survival,” follows an anonymous individual and his wife’s immigration and marriage status issues due to the pandemic. 
Voiced by Vicente Saintignon, a senior majoring in acting for the stage, screen and new media, “Love or Survival” begins by comparing the couple’s wedding to the wedding of the man’s grandparents, as both had occurred during difficult times. Animated portions of the video overlay photographs of the man’s family and spouse, capturing his emotions as he wonders if he will be able to remain with his wife in the United States. 
Each of the six stories selected is presented through a unique multimedia format, utilizing elements like stop motion animation, narration and sound design to reimagine theater in the current virtual world.
The original concept for Hidden Stories was proposed during the summer, but the team did not meet up until classes started last fall. As part of their “Theatre Practicum” class, the team devoted their time to creating the Hidden Stories project in place of planning a show. The student-led team consisted of 14 members collaborating with faculty mentors and theatre staff. 
These students served as concept creators, designers and managers overseeing the progress and were assigned to work in smaller teams on different stories. One member brought Hidden Stories online by managing social media and creating the website. 
During the production of “Love or Survival,” concept creator Maddy Engelsman, a junior majoring in design, kept close contact with the person who originally submitted the story to provide an appropriate presentation of his experience.
“I was in consistent communication with the submitter of that story just to ensure that, because they were going through an ongoing legal situation that I wasn’t overstepping any boundaries,” Engelsman said. 
After finishing the first story, the viewer engages with more links to access other stories like “The Corona Express,” submitted by USC student Sam Feehan. This stop motion piece follows a person taking a train as he listens to the sound of the train moving and people chattering around him.
“What I decided to do was break everything down and find out what sound effects were needed … and what things I would have to make myself,” said Belle Alatorre, a sophomore majoring in sound design who worked on “The Corona Express.” “I added the sound effects into Final Cut Pro and aligned them correctly and cut them and tried to bring the volume down and up and stuff like that.”
Engelsman said the worsening pandemic led to a change in the direction of Hidden Stories. The original idea had Hidden Stories take place on campus with doors that people could interact with. Now, with the project completely virtual, the door motif can be found in the Hidden Stories logo and visual stories instead.
“It was going to be kind of like a scavenger hunt kind of situation,” Engelsman said. “The more that COVID-19 progressed, the more virtual we had to go with our idea … It kind of went away from an in-person scavenger hunt to a puzzle piece experience on our website.”
Working on Hidden Stories required communicating with others online, including people from three different time zones. Most of the multimedia stories could be done remotely, like “The Corona Express,” which was done in one of the artist’s apartments. 
“Even when you’re not in the room with your peers and your co-workers, you can find them generally on campus and ask them a quick question, or you can send them a text,” said Sofia D’Annunzio, a junior majoring in stage management who helped facilitate some of the meetings. “It was harder to keep people accountable for communications. I wouldn’t say that specifically affected our project but just as an overall takeaway from online creation in general.”
Turner’s story submission, “Masked Madness,” however, called for a theater space to be used and for items to be requested from the campus’s scenic shop — the specialized workshop where props and sets are made. Props such as toilet paper and a fake dog were gathered with only limited staff allowed on campus and students could not visit the set.
“We had people who worked in our scenic shop able to be [on campus] but a very limited number of individuals,” said Domenica Diaz, concept creator and project manager of Hidden Stories. “We were all in L.A., but we were all Zooming in our respective homes, and we would have meetings twice a week for three to four hours with the whole team to do content pitches … but if anything needed to happen in the real world, in the theatre space, it had to be done through faculty or staff.” 
Choosing the stories to convert into a multimedia format required input by all members of the team. USC Libraries already had various entries in its archive. Tracking each story required the use of an Excel spreadsheet. The stories were then narrowed down to around 20 submissions and sent out to the other team members for feedback out of which six were used for the project.
When these six stories were published, Turner expressed her amusement at seeing the conversion of her submission into a fully-fledged artistic piece. Her story centers around discussions of how the pandemic had caused the loss of one of her friends and has led to Turner finding activities to do during quarantine, such as spending time with her pet.
“I thought it was really funny they included my dog,” Turner said. “There’s a scene where I’m making her food, and they had that scene where I was making the dog food, and I thought that was really cool.”
Other than doing the voiceover, Turner did not engage in the final project in any other way. Like many of the others who submitted, she gave the Hidden Stories team as much creative freedom as they liked.
“We didn’t have a lot of contact with the people that we were doing this with other than granting their permission or getting their permission to alter their pieces in whatever way, as an artistic expression,” said Mimi Bower, a senior majoring in stage management who also served as a designer.
Other members of the team also shared their personal experiences on how they felt working on some of the stories. Alatorre and Sydney Fabis, a sophomore majoring in theatre, both recounted the process of putting together Hidden Stories and the tasks they enjoyed being a part of.
“My favorite part was being able to bring research about how to be less ablest and how to open up more art forms to other people,” Alatorre said. “I brought in a lot of different color wheels and how [they help] people and how closed captioning on videos … can be more accessible to others.”
Despite difficulty in getting access to certain tools, such as paid versions of certain sound design programs, Alatorre successfully worked on creating the sound design for the animated stories, including “Love or Survival” and “The Corona Express.”
Fabis said she enjoyed being part of the collaborative process behind Hidden Stories and the unity brought in their online meetings. She had the opportunity to be in charge of the art direction featured in the story “The Last Trip Out,” which utilizes water color to tell the story of senior Megan Lacsamana as she processes the events leading up to the pandemic at the beginning of March. 
“I was in charge of the story, of the art direction, for that short film for the animation, and then I got to be in charge of two freshmen students who helped illustrate all my backgrounds for me on that short film,” Fabis said. “They were fantastic. They took my initial thoughts and ran with it and made these beautiful watercolor portraits like background paintings and landscapes and stuff.”
Overall, the reception to Hidden Stories has been incredibly positive with praise coming from different students and faculty. 
“People really seem to like [Hidden Stories],” Domenica said. “I had people in SDA who were not affiliated with the project, who were not even production students, text me about it and saying they really liked it. The USC librarians really enjoyed it. I got three emails from the librarians saying, ‘This is really cool, we really like this.’”
Correction: A previous version of this article misquoted Domenica Diaz as saying “SCA” instead of “SDA.” The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In a quarantined world occupied by me, myself and Zoom, why not add a good back-to-school playlist into the mix? With classes starting, Zoom fatigue is soon to plague USC students. Through our tiredness, it’s essential to stay feeling good about ourselves and continue looking our best. While this period of our lives may be marked by sitting in front of a lifeless, soulless piece of aluminum (or whatever your computer is made of), we can at least count on these upbeat confidence-boosters to keep us pushing (and dancing) in between our classes.
Bree Runway – “GUCCI” (feat. Maliibu Miitch)
As a playlist starter, “GUCCI” is an energetic collaboration off of up-and-coming U.K. rapper Bree Runway’s debut mixtape, “2000AND4EVA,” that’s sure to wake you up and get you ready to look your hottest for that Zoom discussion.
Flo Milli – “May I”
Flo Milli’s talent goes far beyond her TikTok hit, “Beef FloMix.” Track nine off her debut mixtape, “Ho, why is you here?”, is a banger to envision choreography to and have everyone uttering the rapper’s catchphrase, “Flo Milli Shit!”
Saweetie – “Best Friend” (feat. Doja Cat)
“Beep Beep! Is that my bestie in a Tessie?”, said Saweetie as she gets ready to hype up her friend Doja Cat. The hit encourages us to not only love ourselves but spread our love to our besties.
Nelly Furtado – “Maneater”
This fierce throwback will have you feeling like you’re on top of the world. Even Nelly Furtado said the song was so rapturous that a speaker caught on fire when recording it.
Wonder Girls – “So Hot”
This 2008 K-pop classic reminds us that we are, indeed, “so hot” and “so fine.” The song’s legacy continues through its renditions by contemporary girl groups like Twice and Blackpink.
Tinashe – “Hopscotch”
Tinashe is a gem to R&B, continuing to prove her versatility and talent since her 2014 hit “2 On.” Hopscotch is a song off of her fourth studio album, “Songs for You,” that shows her ability to crank out a hip-hop track about her beloved city of Los Angeles.
Nicki Minaj – “Chun-Li”
It wouldn’t be a motivational playlist without a Nicki Minaj classic. Whether you’re a barb or not, “Chun-Li” is a recent Nicki Minaj hit that unleashes the listener’s inner “Street Fighter.”
Megan Thee Stallion – “Realer”
Megan Thee Stallion has had phenomenal success recently, and a look back at her catalogue will tell you why. “Realer,” off her third mixtape, will have you feeling like a hottie and push you through the dullest of Zoom classes.
N.E.R.D. & Rihanna – “Lemon” 
“Lemon” is an upbeat track featuring vocals from Pharrell Williams and Rihanna. It’s one to keep us dancing after class and intensify our need for new Rihanna music.
ROSALÍA & J. Balvin – “Con Altura” (feat. El Guincho)
The worldwide hit “Con Altura” is about making every action count and making your efforts as strong as they can be. Motivation from Rosalía and J. Balvin is definitely something we all need to get through the semester “Con Altura.”
Bad Bunny – “Yo Perreo Sola”
The empowerment anthem “Yo Perreo Sola,” meaning “I twerk alone,” can be interpreted in various ways. In a time of coronavirus, we are literally dancing alone, and Bad Bunny reminds us that there’s nothing wrong with that.
BLACKPINK – “Pretty Savage”
Arguably one of the biggest girl groups in the world, Blackpink brings an attitude many aspire to have in “Pretty Savage” — the third track off their debut album. 
Britney Spears – “Work Bitch”
One thing’s for sure: This semester is going to require some work to get through. Sometimes all we need is a push from Britney telling us, “You better work bitch.”
The Pussycat Dolls – “When I Grow Up”
One of the best ways to motivate yourself is to reflect on what we once desired. “When I Grow Up” by The Pussycat Dolls, a song that defined many childhoods, helps us do exactly that and reminds us that our dreams, whatever they may look like, might just come true.

The meek have officially inherited the earth. 
While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey may have once been the up-and-coming-internet-nerd-underdogs that the world was rooting for, they now find themselves at the top of the food chain in most of the developed world. Following former President Donald Trump’s ban from Twitter, Facebook and the like, it has only become clearer that in today’s landscape, these two men, among a handful of big tech CEOs, have become the main arbiters for acceptable speech within the most popular modern day public sphere: social media. 
As is the case with any well-oiled democracy, those in power must always have counteracting forces that keep their goals aligned with the people. In the case of powerful corporations, oftentimes (though notably not all of the time), it is the forces of the free market that work to keep businesses in service of consumers. Simply put, if people don’t like what a company is doing in any capacity, they can boycott their goods or services and either successfully pressure the for-profit entity to change their ways or consumers can turn to the free market’s eager competitors.
While it may seem intuitive to apply this same check and balance system to corporations that provide social media services, a quick look into the nature of a social media platform reveals that it cannot quite work the same way in such a peculiar marketplace. 
Social media platforms benefit from a phenomenon known as “network effects” whereby much of the value of a good or service is derived from the amount of other participants using or purchasing the same good or service. Take Instagram for example. What would Instagram be if no one in our circles were on it? The more people one knows on a social network, the more valuable a network becomes in achieving one of users’ main goals: socializing. 
This heavy dependence on network effects makes the social media platform market inherently uncompetitive; there really is not much room for more than a handful of key players. Even in the most competitive version of this marketplace, the most valuable social media services for users will be the ones that necessarily eat up the largest chunk of their respective market and thus have the largest pool of socializers. 
So even when users are dissatisfied, they rarely have anywhere else to go, making boycotting an app like Twitter next to impossible for the average person. Moreover, an entire article can be written about the more deliberate anti-competitive tendencies of big tech firms like Facebook and Google who are both currently being sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, respectively, for such practices. 
It is for these reasons that the free market alone is insufficient in regulating big tech firms. In the best case scenario, even in the freest market, there is only room for a few big tech social media firms. This also means that in the event that such firms had an incentive to censor or suppress any kind of information, this decision would be reached by convincing only a handful of CEOs and major shareholders in these companies. Whether one agrees with the Trump twitter ban or not, few are excited to hand over unchecked power to censor the people’s voices, remarkably including the President’s, to a small minority of unelected and notably ultrarich individuals. 
So, what options are left in terms of regulation? While this is unchartered territory, interesting moves are being made around the world to deal with this issue. Poland, for instance, is flirting with a bill that would fine any big tech firm that censored speech that is considered legal by Polish law. At what is undoubtedly a critical time for the internet, this feels like the appropriate direction to go in. 
These largely unchecked firms ought to stray away from content moderation and concern themselves primarily with issues of legality, punting the responsibility of arbitrating acceptable speech to elected government officials (at least in countries where government officials are elected). This way, the arbitrators would be held more accountable for their actions, albeit marginally so. 
All in all, this is a pretty exciting time for the world. Together we get to decide precisely what kind of cliché Orwellian nightmare the Internet will devolve into, and isn’t that what it’s all about at the end of the day?

2020 was like a never-ending nightmare — endless cycles of closing and reopening due to pandemic surges, a constant battle against police brutality, an incessant amount of Zoom meetings, the Capitol being stormed by right-wing domestic terrorists — broken up with a few flashes of comical alternative-reality. One recent example being Pinterest’s ban on former President Donald Trump.  
However, for the sake of my sanity and the topic of this column, I’m here to focus on the key environmental takeaways from 2020. In most environmental news coverage, disasters are often the focal point — the sensationalization of damages and deaths attract far more viewership than stories of progress and cooperation. 
2020 started off with wildfires scorching millions of acres in Australia, killing or displacing as many as three billion animals and plumes of smoke traveling as far as 7,000 miles away. Likewise, California experienced its worst wildfire season on record in terms of acres burned, as well as the largest individual wildfire. 
Destructive typhoons and flash-flooding hit countries in the Pacific, and the Atlantic experienced its strongest hurricane season on record. Heavy rains and cyclonic activity caused desert locust swarms in Africa, and Siberia endured a warm season that caused wildfires producing high carbon emissions and further thawing the Arctic permafrost.
In August, a shipping vessel ran aground on a reef and spilled roughly 1,000 tons of oil into the pristine waters off the coast of Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean renowned for its pristine reefs and turquoise waters. 
As if there weren’t already enough going on globally, the United States formally left the Paris Climate Agreement in November, with Trump reneging on the United States’s pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, marking an abrupt end to U.S. monetary assistance to fight carbon emissions worldwide leaving a funding shortfall for smaller countries struggling to mitigate the financial fallout of climate change. 
The amount of natural, structural and human damage caused by these environmental emergencies is staggering, but this is only the tip of the (rapidly melting) iceberg. While these are just a few environmental lowlights of the past year, it’s imperative to understand that many of their long-term effects cannot be purely attributed to a single factor. Social unrest, economic instability and the worst public health crisis in a century have compounded every environmental disaster into something much, much worse. 
Coronavirus set an apocalyptic backdrop for a year already filled with turmoil. Shuttered businesses turned the economy into a downward spiral. Limitations due to social distancing and public health concerns meant that the typical manpower in fighting climate-related crises was diminished, and people were more susceptible to illness and disease due to bad air quality or living in cramped evacuee shelters. With limited import and exportation, food waste was at an all-time high. 
In some cases, the technology or resources to adequately prevent climate change-induced disasters doesn’t yet exist. The consequences of some of the events this past year will not be resolved in the near future — an oil spill can be cleaned up, but it will take hundreds of years for the Mauritian coral reefs to recover. And yet, progress is impossible without optimism. Even though it may be hard to believe, there is hope for a better 2021. 
Despite the looming shadow of Trump and his environmental policy rollbacks, Congress has passed key legislation to protect America’s national parks with the Great American Outdoors Act, which permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund and provides several billion dollars to maintain facilities and infrastructures in national parks, forests and wildlife refuges. 
Scientists have spotted numerous blue whales this past year, estimating a population of over 2,000, and noted a dramatic recovery due to the International Whaling Commission’s ban on hunting the animals, which were nearing extinction. 
The Ocean Panel, which is composed of fourteen world leaders, put forth a plan of action committed to sustainably managing 100% of the ocean area under their national jurisdiction by 2025, producing more food, generating more renewable energy and contributing to globally reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The beginning of the lockdown in March gave scientists a rare opportunity to more accurately study the impact humans have on the natural world. Coined the “anthropause,” the slowing of human activity and travel allowed for a brief respite from heavy air pollution and land, air and sea traffic, giving scientists valuable information on more sustainably maintaining the balance of ecosystems in the future. 
Due to the pandemic, oil and natural gas prices hit historic lows — prompting 36 oil companies to stall for bankruptcy and stalling pipeline projects around the world. For the first time ever, wind and solar accounted for nearly 10% of all electricity, and the United States installed a record number of new wind and solar projects.  
The Biden presidency on the horizon bodes well for increasing the growth of the renewable energy sector, minimizing carbon emissions and moving towards the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. As Biden prepares to take office, big banks are expecting to face more scrutiny about how their actions and investments will impact climate change. Biden even plans to issue an executive order requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their emissions, impose climate-related stress tests and higher capital requirements on fossil fuel financing and increase transparency about their influence on climate change. 
While news outlets are rightfully focused on the coverage of environmental disasters, the fight against anthropogenic climate alteration is a long-term commitment and steady grind. As with any goal, it’s important to celebrate the small victories and let them fuel us as we continue progressing in the right direction.

In trying times, the small things can remind us of what we really treasure. Such is the story of “WiNDUP,” a 9-minute animated short created in real-time through animation software platform Unity. As the product of a collaboration of artists working remotely from around the world, the very existence of this film is a testament to the importance of global connections and the ties that keep us together. 
On Tuesday, a 45-minute virtual event featured a live screening of the film and a Q&A with director Yibing Jiang and animation director Jason Keane, moderated by Variety Film Awards editor Clayton Davis. 
“WiNDUP” chronicles the bond between an ailing daughter named Kiki and her father. The story is an emotional one, as Kiki’s father repeatedly attempts to connect with his unconscious daughter by playing a windup music box of her favorite tune. There’s a larger story reflected here, in an especially poignant tale about love and worry as part of the human experience. 
Yet, the personal moments of the film are the most compelling. There is no dialogue, but the mere sound of the music box winding becomes a vehicle to convey the father’s love for his daughter. Through a montage of quiet scenes spent at the hospital, the music box is the only constant amid the ventilator’s whirring and an unconscious Kiki. “WiNDUP” then takes a more mystical turn when Kiki journeys through beautiful and unfamiliar landscapes in her dreams as she follows the music. In the hospital room, the music box breaks and the father begins to sing instead. In what proves to be the film’s most emotional moment, Kiki opens her eyes to her tearful father. 
“WiNDUP” director and writer Yibing Jiang is a Chinese American filmmaker from Wuhan, a city that has recently made international headlines during the pandemic. Yet Jiang takes a more nuanced approach to her hometown, one that doesn’t make a spectacle out of illness or dehumanize its origin. Instead, “WiNDUP” offers a willingness to delve beyond the stigma of illness and into the lives of those who are most affected by it. 
Themes of love and life are central to the film. They’re also, Jiang reflects, why health and illness feature most prominently in discussions of the storyline of a familial bond. These themes are motivated by her own experiences growing up as a child who was often sick and the significance of the film during the coronavirus pandemic. 
“[My parents] spent countless nights taking care of me,” Jiang said. “When I got older, I started to empathize with my parents … I remember when we were animating the hospital sequence when the father actually was sitting on the floor and [feeling] hopeless. [In] that moment, I can totally sympathize with the pain.”
Davis echoed similar sentiments about the film’s contemporary relevance amid concerns about illness and its impact on individuals. 
“[The story] is deeply personal, and we’re in a time right now where the pandemic is living and ravaging its way through the world,” Davis said. 
Visually, the animation acknowledges the darker side of illness while also paying a stunning testament to the power of imagination. The muted, darker shades of the hospital room are placed in contrast with the pastel hues of Kiki’s personal dreamland and the magical qualities of the Asia-inspired architecture. Such vivid imagery renders the characters and setting distinctly ethereal but also fundamentally believable. 
In the process of giving the story life, Keane took into account the idea of character-driven animation. 
“[Kiki] has this spark of energy into her, and it was perfect for Kiki because we wanted to contrast that love of life, arts [and] music versus her situation,” Keane said. “In terms of animation and characters and personality, [the animation team was] able to put their own kind of history and their feelings within the scenes that they had, and it really brought the characters to life.” 
When asked what motivated the creators to make a dialogue-free film, Jiang expressed that previous iterations of “WiNDUP” had contained dialogue. The decision to remove spoken language was a strategic choice of accessibility. 
“We believe that music is a universal language, and the theme of the story is universal, so we really want people all over the world able to connect with it,” Jiang said. 
For Jiang, “WiNDUP” may be specifically drawn from her own past, but can provide a global space for empathy. It’s a story about the relationships between people and the lives we share. “Life imitates art, I think, especially now — a time when people around the world are isolated and craving for connections and also preoccupied with the health and well-being of loved ones,” Jiang said. 
Most of all, though, the story is one about healing. It’s not only about the power of music but also about hope and the worldbuilding that hope engenders. “WiNDUP” creates a world that allows us to acknowledge our present yet cultivate a sense of possibility regarding the uncertainties of the future. There’s a beautiful message in the film — in a world where love takes the shape of a music box, it only takes our imaginations to help us find our ways back home. 
“WiNDUP” is available for viewing online through YouTube.
