Nearly 200 students attended a conversation with writers, directors and producers from The Walt Disney Company and DreamWorks Animation about Hollywood’s entertainment and animation industry Monday. The event, hosted by the John Wells Division of Writing for Screen & Television and Film & Television Writers of USC, invited the creators of “Finding Nemo,” “Tarzan” and “Phineas and Ferb” to speak about their creative processes.
The panel included “Finding Nemo” writer David Reynolds, Disney story artist and director Stevie Wermers, “Phineas and Ferb” co-creator Dan Povenmire, and “How to Train Your Dragon” executive producer Tim Johnson. Mary Bronough, president of Film and Television Writers USC, introduced the panel and School of Cinematic Arts screenwriting professor Robert Ramsey moderated.
Ramsey asked Wermers to explain how she started her career in animation and became an Academy Award winning writer and artist for Disney.
“It wasn’t until I saw “Beauty and the Beast” [that I pursued animation],” Wermers said. “I thought this movie was amazing. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I went to Cal Arts and I talked to one of the counselors there and I applied and they’re like ‘you’re in.’”
Povenmire said that the entertainment industry is unlike any other industry when it comes to the chain of command because executives are involved mostly for the sake of providing entertainment. In other industries, Povenmire explained, executives can be part of a project for years, but in entertainment their expiration date is typically one to two years. 
This unique investment in the entertainment value of a creation is key to the animation process, Povenmire continued.
“What you want from your executives is for them to feel ownership of that show,” Povenmire said. “You can’t buy that kind of energy, when they feel like they’re part of this, and it’s their show too.” 
Johnson gave advice to audience members looking to start a career in animation. He suggested taking improvisation classes to learn how to think quickly in tough situations. 
“My favorite principle of craft comes from improv, which is you never get to say no,” Johnson said. “It’s a great principle for running a brainstorming meeting. It’s a great way to treat executives. It’s a great way to deal with your partner in life.” 
During the question and answer session that followed the panel, one student asked for advice on starting a professional screenwriting career.
Povenmire said finding your way into the entertainment industry is an individual path.
“No one can tell you how to get your first gig,” Povenmire said. “They can only tell you how they got their gig-collect enough of those and you’ll have a road map.” 
Rose Bueno, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, said the final remark by Povenmire stood out to her.  
“It was particularly impactful to hear, especially at the end, their closing remarks about getting your first start in the industry and that there is no clear path,” Bueno said. “It’s a testament that people will get to where they need to if they’re determined.”

It’s pitch black in the basement of a house on 28th Street, where approximately 25 freshman boys stand tightly packed. Amid complete silence, the door slams open and loud music pours in. Two men, silhouettes against the yellow light from the doorway, hold enough alcohol to supply a party. They order the pledges to drink up for the long night ahead.
For decades, scenes like this one — conveyed to the Daily Trojan by a former fraternity member — have felt familiar to students who go through the process of joining, or “pledging,” a fraternity. To prove their dedication, new fraternity members typically go through an initiation period that lasts several weeks or months, which can involve hazing — harassment or abuse from older members of the house. 
That culture is now starting to change, a Daily Trojan investigation has found. Following multiple reports of hazing from different USC fraternities, the University is cracking down on misconduct among Greek organizations. In the past year, five fraternities were investigated for hazing violations, misconduct or drug abuse, according to USC’s Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development. Three ultimately lost University recognition.
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, this number is unprecedented. Carry said he believes this increase is due to the University receiving more reports of concerning behavior than ever before through Department of Public Safety calls, the LiveSafe app and anonymous tips.
“There have been at least six organizations that have been suspended over the past three years, and it’s a five-to-six-year suspension,” Carry said. “What has changed is that more students are reporting these incidents now.”
These investigations come on the heels of a turbulent year for Greek life on campus. The University deferred the rush process — which traditionally takes place in the first week of fall classes — until the spring for students who do not have a USC GPA, most of whom are incoming freshmen and transfer students. Carry championed this initiative as essential for mental health and academic performance. 
In DPS reports obtained by Daily Trojan, officers responded to incidents on Greek Row 216 times in 2018. Most responses resulted in the individuals complying with officers’ requests. However, a dozen of those requests resulted in either a full party shutdown or reports sent to Student Affairs. 
Now, as Carry prepares to leave USC in April, fraternities who have reportedly hazed their members are on the chopping block.  
John Hechinger, a senior editor at Bloomberg News and author of “True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America’s Fraternities,” says, however, that universities traditionally aren’t in any rush to get fraternities in trouble due to the rock-solid alumni ties they often institute. 
“The alumni association of fraternities are big donors,” Hechinger said. “They often put pressure on administrators if they crack down, so unless there’s a lot of public pressure or something really horrific happens, the easiest course is to kind of look the other way.”
Hechinger believes, however, that social media and cell phone videos are able to capture so much more of what happens behind closed doors, that “it’s really in your face, so it’s really hard to deny.”
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS
The FSLD website lists five Greek organizations that were investigated over the past year: Sigma Alpha Mu, Pi Kappa Phi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Xi. 
Pi Kappa Phi, Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Xi officially lost University recognition after investigations found evidence of hazing. 
Phi Sigma Kappa was taken off of interim suspension after the University failed to find conclusive evidence for allegations of misconduct in November 2018. 
In the past academic year, Sigma Alpha Mu — widely known as “Sammy” — was placed on interim suspension twice for hazing allegations, according to FSLD. 
The first suspension began in October 2018 while the University investigated alleged hazing violations. 
A month later, the Undergraduate Student Government received screenshots from a private Sammy member Facebook group showing pro-hazing comments made in Fall 2017 by current members, including outgoing USG Vice President Blake Ackerman, the Daily Trojan previously reported. 
The screenshots, which were also sent anonymously to the Daily Trojan, show Ackerman and others supporting a post that encouraged pledges to have sex in a casket during “hell week” — the final, most intense week of pledging for new fraternity members before initiation.
Ackerman said he regretted the implication in the comments and that he did not condone hazing, the Daily Trojan previously reported. Sammy’s suspension was lifted a week later, but the organization was suspended again on Jan. 17. That suspension was lifted on March 12.
“The Mu Theta chapter does not condone the events from Fall 2017,” the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The current leadership was elected based on an anti-hazing platform.”
Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards declined to comment on past investigations, though Sammy confirmed it was being investigated by SJACS.
Jordan Carmona, a judicial officer from SJACS, said conclusions to the investigations are not made public. Instead, when an investigation on a house is concluded, the final decision is given to the chapter president, who decides what to do with the information. 
“We will continue to cooperate with the University administration as they investigate concerns,” Sammy said in a statement to Daily Trojan. “[We are] committed to creating a safe and positive fraternity experience at USC. We will continue our cooperation with SJACS on this matter and hope that a resolution can be reached quickly.”
Another screenshot sent anonymously to the Daily Trojan shows a Las Vegas scavenger hunt list from October 2017 that allegedly instructed Sammy pledges to film an “active shooter conspiracy video” inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, where the largest mass shooting in recent U.S. history had taken place just three weeks prior. SJACS did not confirm whether it investigated this incident.
Andy Huston, executive director of Sammy’s national chapter, wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that the USC chapter has changed its policies since the hazing incidents and is committed to enforcing member safety. 
“We are disappointed about the misconduct from Fall 2017 involving our chapter at USC,” Huston wrote. “Since [the Las Vegas incident], we have made substantial changes at the Mu Theta chapter, including completely new chapter leadership.”
Huston confirmed that the leaders involved in the incident are no longer affiliated with the fraternity. 
“Beginning in 2018, the chapter implemented a revamped candidate education program that was reviewed and approved by both the International Headquarters and USC’s [FSLD] Office,” Huston wrote. “We are continuing to cooperate fully with the University and are committed to taking additional actions that help ensure all of our members are supporting a healthy and safe environment.”
In addition to the allegations against Sammy, the USC chapter of Theta Xi filed a lawsuit against SJACS Director Donna Budar-Turner and Carry in 2018 after losing University recognition due to a hazing allegation that the fraternity claims is false. 
“Theta Xi was never provided official notice outlining the specific factual allegations or policies allegedly violated and was only told there were ‘reports of alleged behaviors that may have endangered the University community, including hazing,’” the lawsuit read. 
According to the suit, a former member of Theta Xi reported concerns of organizational misconduct to SJACS in January 2018. 
The former member was placed on social probation and eventually resigned from the organization after reports that he engaged in sexual misconduct and racist behavior, the suit read. The former member attempted to join another fraternity but was dismissed from that fraternity due to similar sexual misconduct allegations.  
“After [he] resigned from Theta Xi, he tried to have Theta Xi removed from USC fraternity row and simultaneously threatened several of the members living in the … fraternity house,” the complaint read.
The suit alleges Theta Xi was placed on interim suspension as a result of the filed complaint, and the organization was never provided with an official notice outlining the allegations. 
The suit also includes a report from Theta Xi’s president detailing his experience with Turner during SJACS’ investigation of the fraternity while it was on interim suspension.
“During the course of the meeting, which lasted two hours, I was asked many leading questions … I was given no time to give any clarification or tell my side of the story,” the suit read. “It felt as if [Turner] had already made her mind up of what she believed and was only set on forcing the answers that she wanted out of me … I wasn’t offered any water or breaks … the mental and emotional stress that this situation brought on me has caused me to lose sleep, suffer … and seek out on-campus counseling.”
According to the suit, USC provided no opportunity for Theta Xi to cross examine the witness, who was described by fellow members in the suit as “being very disrespectful towards women” and as having allegedly said “women exist on the planet so [he] can have sex with them.” 
Turner found the complaint against Theta Xi was substantiated and sanctioned the immediate loss of recognition for the fraternity. 
THE CULTURE OF HAZING
Hazing at USC fraternities ranges in intensity, encompassing everything from making pledges do menial tasks for active members to forcing them to drink alcohol until they black out. 
Heavy drinking, in particular, has proven to be one of the most dangerous forms of pledging at USC.
In April 2017, Alasdair Russell, who was pledging Phi Kappa Psi, died by suicide after withdrawing from USC that January. 
His mother filed a lawsuit against the University claiming that Phi Kappa Psi members forced her son to drink so much that he fell off of a platform and injured his head at a party in October 2016, causing him emotional duress in the months that followed. 
According to previous Daily Trojan reporting, the members allegedly pressured him not to seek immediate medical attention out of fear that they would get in trouble with the University, even though he exhibited concussion-like symptoms such as vomiting, dizziness and headaches. His mother claims in the lawsuit that fraternity members gave her son cocaine and Adderall so that he could resume his pledge duties.
The case echoes the 2017 death of Penn State University student Timothy Piazza, who participated in a pledging ritual called “The Gauntlet” at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. After drinking heavily, Piazza was so inebriated that he fell down a flight of stairs and was knocked unconscious. 
The story made national headlines after reports revealed that Piazza’s fraternity brothers did not transport Piazza to the hospital until 12 hours later, where he was pronounced dead the morning after the party. 
These incidents are the culmination of more than a century of pledging tradition. Hazing, specifically by men, in American higher education dates back to just after the end of the Civil War, when soldiers who had experienced hazing in the military brought it with them to academic institutions. 
Fraternities codified this system for their pledge programs, and ever since then, hazing has been a way to distinguish the men who are not committed or “weak,” according to Hechinger.
In her 2019 book “Fraternity: An Inside Look at a Year of College Boys Becoming Men,” investigative journalist Alexandra Robbins writes that fraternity hazing in the United States increased in the late 1800s as a way for upperclassmen to intimidate younger members. 
Even though today it is a crime in 44 states, including California, 73 percent of people in college Greek life are hazed, according to Robbins. 
“Hazing can be viewed as a means of group survival,” she writes. “People generally want to believe that they are decent citizens who make good decisions. So when they do something stupid or cruel, they feel uncomfortable afterward when they try to reconcile their behavior with their image of themselves.”
Hazing has become such an integral part of the fraternity experience that college freshmen come to campus with expectations already in place. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, an inactive member of Sammy who joined in Fall 2015 and spent three years as a member of the fraternity said hazing continues because pledges expect and want to be hazed.
The former member, who wished to remain anonymous, said the “hazing” he experienced at Sammy consisted mainly of heavy workouts and philosophical discussions — unusual for many fraternities, which tend to include heavy drinking in their hazing processes. During the pledge process, he said most others in his pledge class did not want to participate in these character development activities and instead wanted the “conventional” hazing experience.
“There would be a few nights here and there where the main two guys who were doing their thing were like, ‘We’re going to let some other people take over, and they’ll do the more conventional hazing,’” he said. “Dark robes, loud music, there’s drinking, that sort of thing.”
The former member described how pledges would be placed in a room and told to drink a set amount of alcohol — on weeknights or before chapter meetings. 
Hechinger explains that many fraternities who claim they have eliminated hazing still have a “pledge program,” which is essentially a cover for continuing the same activities.
“But it often gets into really ugly stuff,” Hechinger said. “Humiliation, and the worst is forced drinking that has killed so many students.”
Last month, nine brothers from Delta Kappa Epsilon at Louisiana State University were arrested for hazing-related crimes. They allegedly forced pledges to lie in mounds of broken glass while the active members kicked them with steel-toed boots and urinated on them, according to the New York Post.  
“As long as [fraternities] have a pledge process, inevitably one year or another, it’s going to get out of control, or something terrible is going to happen,” Hechinger said. 
Carry said the most concerning reports the University has received involve students alleging that substances were slipped into their drinks at fraternity parties. 
“I am concerned about the number of random, loosely connected reports that we receive about students having something slipped into their drinks or being roofied at a party or an event,” Carry said. “We will get one report, then we won’t hear anything else in a long time. Then we will get another report.”
Carry said when he meets with students individually regarding these allegations, they say the situation is common on campus.
“But we are not getting these reports of this happening all the time,” Carry said. “We need those reports because those reports eventually give us a pattern. I know people think, ‘Oh, this happened to me and two of my friends, it’s not a big deal, I don’t want to report it or make a big deal out of it’ … We need those reports to identify these patterns.”
JUSTICE AND DUE PROCESS
For many fraternity members, the exact process USC undertakes to investigate Greek organizations is unclear. This came to a head in October when FSLD instructed Sammy and Phi Sigma Kappa to cancel their social activities while they were placed on interim suspension, according to a previous Daily Trojan report.
During the incident, Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard sent both fraternities a memo citing violations of health and safety codes and hazing regulations. Phi Sigma Kappa released a statement following the incident announcing its plans to potentially sue the University over a lack of transparency.
“Unfortunately, the University’s standard operating procedure has been to ‘suspend first, provide information later,’” the statement read. “We believe that procedure runs counter to the law, due process and fundamental fairness.”
After fraternities are placed on interim suspension, the University’s next step is to investigate the nature of the allegations, Carry said.
“While we review this allegation, we pause [the fraternities’] activities so that we can [have a] thorough investigation,” Carry said. “During an interim suspension, we’re doing our homework. We interview … and gather information.”
Carry said that by having the fraternities suspend social activities and events, the University can ensure that no further harm occurs, if the allegations are proven to be true.
“Any time we receive an allegation for inappropriate behavior by a fraternity, we take action, we will interim suspend,” Carry said. “It has always been our approach and it has always been our practice.”
Carry said the increase in suspensions this year is not because the University’s commitment to ensuring safety has changed but because of the amount of reports and tips that the University has received.
As part of the effort to investigate these claims, the Office of Student Affairs has enlisted the help of SJACS, the Office of Professionalism and Ethics and DPS, according to Carry. All four offices work together to interview members of the organizations and key witnesses.
“It’s not a CSI investigation,” Carry said. “People are not in [the fraternity houses] with blue lights and scanning for fingerprints.”
Carry explained that organizations are notified of their conduct violations and are given an opportunity to state their case afterward. When the University comes to a decision, organizations are invited to  make an appeal. 
“What’s missing in that notification is more specifics,” Carry said. “Sometimes, those specific details jeopardize the reporting party.”
Carry explained that the University aims to notify the accused party of a decision no more than 15 days after first notifying them of their violations. However, it took approximately 21 days for Phi Sigma Kappa and Sammy to be notified of their decisions. Carry attributes the extended turnaround time to the fact that many fraternity members and pledges do not show up for interviews, which are part of the investigation. 
Pledges are told by pledge masters not to discuss hazing outside of the fraternity, according to the former Sammy member. 
“Everyone knows hazing is happening, and if you make it into specifics, then it’s a liability,” the former member said. 
Carry said, however, that he urges anyone with information regarding substance abuse, hazing or general concerns to report it, even if the reports are anonymous. In terms of due process, however, Carry said judicial processes for individuals are different than due process for organizations.
Despite the criticism over SJACS’ response to hazing allegations, Carry explained that the administration’s policy values safety over social activities. This means that fraternities are watched more closely than they may like, and the administration will continue to closely monitor their social activities. 
“When we receive the reports that we received, out of … taking care of the community, I would prefer to stop a group, then receive a continuation of hazing reports,” Carry said. “If a kid dies, we won’t be having a conversation about why you didn’t let them throw a party.”

The men’s and women’s tennis teams had strong road showings this past weekend, as they both return to Los Angeles with victories in hand. The women continued their strong season with a 5-2 conference victory over Oregon, USC’s eighth straight win. The men’s team, on the other hand, earned a statement 4-2 win over No. 3 Texas, which could help turn around its mixed season. 
In Eugene, the surging women’s team fared well with a strong effort over the struggling Oregon Ducks. 
Oregon was forced to forfeit the first doubles match because the Ducks were short-handed due to injuries and could not field a full roster. The Ducks were able to get a win on Court 2, leaving the doubles point to be decided on Court 1. The 20th-ranked team of senior Rianna Valdes and junior Angela Kulikov secured a 6-2 win to clinch the doubles point.
The Ducks were once again forced to forfeit a singles match, giving freshman Estella Jaeger the win. Junior Constance Branstine made the score 3-0 with a quick 6-2, 6-1 match. Junior Sydney Van Alphen got her second match-clinching win of the season with a dominant 6-0, 6-2 win. 
With the 4-0 lead, the teams decided to play out the rest of the matches in progress. Sophomore Ana Neffa and junior Becca Weissmann lost their matches while freshman Salma Ewing came from behind to win her match 3-6, 7-6 (2), 10-6.
This win continues USC’s hot streak, improving its record to 12-2 on the season and 3-0 in Pac-12 play. This is the Trojans’ best start to a season since 2015.
USC’s sterling play stands in stark contrast to an Oregon team that has struggled as of late. The Ducks are 6-11 and a dismal 0-6 in conference play. Oregon’s loss to USC was its eighth straight defeat.
The women’s team will look to continue its hot streak, as it takes on No. 19 Cal and No. 4 Stanford at home this weekend.
The men’s team squared off against a Texas team that had just upset the top-ranked Ohio State team in Austin the weekend before. This was a must-win match for the Trojans to show that they are still among the elite teams in college tennis. 
USC got off to a fast start, as sophomore Daniel Cukierman and senior Tanner Smith won their doubles match 6-4. Soon afterward, seniors Laurens Verboven and Jack Jaede clinched the doubles point for the Trojans with a 6-3 win. 	
The Trojans also succeeded in singles play. Junior Riley Smith had an emphatic 6-3, 6-2 win from the No. 5 position to start play. The Longhorns, however, responded quickly with two wins to tie singles play at 2-2. Junior captain Brandon Holt took control of his match and upset the No. 6 player in the country, junior Christian Sigsgaard, 6-4, 6-4. To close things out for the Trojans, freshman Mor Bulis got his first-ever match-clinching win with a tight 6-2, 7-5 win to seal the 4-2 upset against the Longhorns. 
The win moves the No. 15 men’s team to 11-6 on the season. The Trojans will look to carry their momentum into a weekend matchup in the Bay Area, as they try to avenge losses to Stanford and Cal earlier this season.

The USC baseball team left Seattle this weekend empty-handed, dropping all three games against the Huskies and falling to a record of 8-14 on the season.
USC lost 7-1 in Friday’s series opener. The contest was relatively drama-free, as Washington jumped out to an early 1-0 lead in the second inning, tacked on 3 runs in the fourth and coasted to an easy victory.
Junior pitcher Connor Lunn started the game on the mound for the Trojans and allowed 4 runs through seven innings on the day.
Lunn was outdueled by Washington freshman pitcher David Rhodes. Rhodes hurled six scoreless innings for the Huskies, allowing only one hit — a single to freshman designated hitter Emilio Rosas — in the dominant outing.
USC’s only run of the day came on a fielder’s choice by sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez in the seventh inning. After Rhodes was pulled for junior Chris Micheles in the seventh inning, the Trojans loaded the bases with nobody out — a chance to claw away at what was then a 5-run deficit. USC managed only the single run in the inning, with Rhodes striking out freshman catcher Tyler Lozano and getting Rosas to pop out to second base.
The Trojans saw a tighter game on Saturday. Washington again went up 1-0 in the third inning, but USC answered this time. Senior shortstop Chase Bushor tied the game at 1 with a bunt base hit that scored senior second baseman Brandon Perez. Sophomore right fielder Jamal O’Guinn gave the Trojans a 2-1 lead in the sixth with a single that caromed off of second base to score junior outfielder Blake Sabol.
The lead didn’t last long, as the Huskies answered with 2 more runs in the seventh inning to go on top 3-2. With one out in the frame, sophomore center fielder Braiden Ward hit a line drive to Bushor’s right that glanced off the shortstop’s glove and kicked into the outfield, allowing a run that tied the score.
With one out and runners on first and second, Ramirez fielded a ground ball and stepped on third base for the second out, but his throw to first went wild and allowed Washington to take a 3-2 lead as Ward scored all the way from first.
USC tied the game up again in the eighth inning on a RBI single from Ramirez to score Bushor. Junior pitcher Chris Clarke escaped a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the inning to keep the game tied. The 3-3 score would hold through nine innings.
In the bottom of the tenth, Husky senior left fielder Mason Cerrillo led things off with a single, took second on a wild pitch and advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt. After Clarke intentionally loaded the bases with one out, Ward lifted a sacrifice fly deep enough to score Cerrillo for Washington’s 4-3 walk-off win.  
Sophomore pitcher Isaac Esqueda turned in a solid outing for USC, allowing no earned runs in six innings. Bushor, O’Guinn and Perez each collected 2 hits as part of an 11-hit attack.
Looking to avoid a sweep, the Trojans sent sophomore Kyle Hurt to the mound on Sunday. After four scoreless innings from both starting pitchers, it was USC who cracked the scoreboard first. A single from Sabol in the fifth inning scored junior outfielder Brady Shockey to give the Trojans a 1-0 lead.
Washington fired back in the sixth inning with a 2-run single past a diving Ramirez at third base to take a 2-1 lead.
Bushor’s RBI single with one out in the eighth inning knotted things up again, 2-2. Hurt escaped a first and third jam in the bottom of the inning, with his 112th pitch of the game resulting in a groundout to a diving Perez to keep the score tied.
Neither team reached base in the ninth inning, sending the game to extras for the second day in a row. For the second straight day, Washington came out victorious with a 10th inning walk-off.
After USC went down in order again in the top of the 10th, Ward singled to right field with one out in the bottom half. The speedy outfielder stole second, and freshman pitcher Carson Lambert walked sophomore outfielder Kaiser Weiss to set the stage for junior catcher Nick Kahle.
Kahle’s third RBI of the day, a fly ball to left field, scored Ward for the second consecutive Husky walk-off, finishing off the sweep with a 3-2 victory.
Defense remained an issue for USC, as they committed six errors over the three games.
The Trojans will look to bounce back from the disappointing weekend with a Tuesday matchup on the road against Long Beach State. The Dirtbags have struggled this season, amassing a 3-19 record thus far, including a 5-2 loss to USC last week. Tuesday’s game will begin at 6 p.m.

In just a few short weeks, the greatest spring tradition in sports will begin again.
March Madness, the NFL Draft, NBA postseason and MLB opening day are all fun, but nothing in this sweet world can match the drama, highs and lows and pure, unadulterated adrenaline of the National Hockey League playoffs.
To some, the NHL playoffs only appeal to Canadians and are overshadowed by the massive headlines and audiences garnered by the NBA postseason. In reality, the NHL playoffs are the greatest demonstration of passion and pride in all of professional or collegiate sports.
Every series is a war, every game is a battle and every goal is a massive strike that can tilt the scales of fate. Quite simply, you will not see professional athletes in one of America’s “Big Four” sports try as hard to win a championship as in the NHL. There’s dreaming of a World Series or a Lombardi, and then there is dreaming of hoisting the Stanley Cup — nothing can compare.
In spite of playing host to the greatest eight weeks of American sports, the NHL has constantly carried the title of America’s fourth sport. Sitting firmly behind the NFL, NBA and MLB, professional hockey does not carry the same dollar value as its competitors. 
Look no further than the contracts paid to the game’s best players. Future hall of famers like Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby carry average annual salaries equivalent to mediocre New Orleans Pelicans players like Solomon Hill ($12 million) and E’Twaun Moore ($8.5 million). 
The Pelicans are 13 games under .500 and 12.5 games out of a playoff spot. Moore and Hill are both extremely inefficient, ranked 255th and 344th respectively in player efficiency ratings among 354 qualified players around the league.
By comparison, McDavid is a 22-year-old wunderkind who has led the league in points twice and won league MVP in just three full seasons before signing his “lucrative” extension. Meanwhile, Sidney Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup Champion and two-time MVP, is considered not only the greatest player of his generation but also possibly one of the 10 greatest players in the history of the game.
It is bizarre to think that a sport that struggles financially, at least by comparison to its peers, and often fails to remain firmly in the national conversation is also most successful at empowering small market and non-traditional franchises.
While there is a downward trend in sports viewership on television, last year’s tilt between the Washington Capitals and Vegas Golden Knights resulted in the most-watched Stanley Cup Finals that didn’t feature one of the league’s “Original Six” teams. While the numbers may not compare to the NBA or MLB, the 17 percent ratings boost over the two-year span looks favorable compared to the equivalent ratings drop experienced by professional baseball and basketball alike.
Additionally, the league has aggressively sought out options to bring the traditional pond hockey concept to markets where it was not only common but also seemingly impossible. The Winter Classic and other outdoor games are annual mainstays for traditional northern franchises such as the Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks, but they have only just recently become common among warm weather teams. 
By 2020, Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas will have played host to outdoor hockey games. 
This season, it would seem that the National Hockey League is again going to showcase at least one — if not two — non-traditional franchises on the game’s championship stage. 
In the Eastern Conference, the Tampa Bay Lightning, my hometown team, has won at a record-setting pace, drawing comparisons to the greatest hockey teams of all time while sporting a cast of soon-to-be MVPs and future Hall of Famers. This is all without mentioning the fact that the team has sold out every home game for the past few years, despite being in a city that plays host to one of America’s notoriously poorly attended teams, the Tampa Bay Rays of the MLB.
A clear favorite is much more difficult to single out in the Western Conference, but among the leading cup contenders in Nashville, Winnipeg, San Jose, Calgary and Vegas, it is more likely than not that a small market team emerges from the pack and plays (possibly for the second time in the last few seasons) in the Stanley Cup Finals.
There is nothing more fun to watch than the Stanley Cup Playoffs and, with the strength of the small market that the NHL boasts, more new fans are getting in on that fun.

Despite top-tier competition from Tennessee, Ole Miss, Miami and Ohio State, the USC track and field team turned in another dominant performance at the Power 5 Trailblazer Challenge in Miami. The Trojans won 14 of the 26 events they competed in over the two-day meet. 
Redshirt junior thrower Matthew Katnik, the only Trojan in action during the first day of competition on Friday, shattered his personal record en route to a victory in the men’s shot put. With a throw of 19.67 meters, Katnik also climbed to fifth on the all-time USC records list. 
On Saturday, USC expanded its success with a series of dazzling performances in the jumps and track events. Sophomore jumper Earnie Sears earned the Trojans’ first win of the day, clearing the 2.17-meter bar in the men’s high jump. 
USC also dominated the women’s long jump. Freshman Lanae-Tava Thomas took first place, and senior Margaux Jones finished in third with jumps of 6.02 meters and 5.86 meters, respectively. 
Freshman Omotade Ojora easily dispatched his competition and earned another win for the Trojans in the men’s 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.16 seconds, despite running into a strong headwind. 
USC also finished with elite performances in the 400-meter dash. On the women’s side, freshman Bailey Lear won the event and earned the second-fastest time in the NCAA this season, clocking in at 52.86. In the men’s 400-meter race, junior Isaiah Jewett took home first place with 2019’s third-best time in the NCAA with a personal record of 46.29. 
Sophomore sprinter TeeTee Terry added to the Trojans’ tally of victories, winning the women’s 100-meter dash with a time of 11.21. Redshirt junior Angie Annelus and redshirt senior Dior Hall also finished in the top five of the crowded 100-meter field with times of 11.50 and 11.61, respectively. 
A pair of Trojan women rewrote USC’s all-time record book in the 800-meter dash: Freshman Alyssa Brewer emerged victorious in the event with the seventh-fastest time in school history of 2:04.73, while fellow freshman and third-place finisher Jemima Russell secured the 11th spot on the list by clocking in at 2:06.09. 
Redshirt senior Isabella Marten impressed in the women’s triple jump with her 13.09-meter leap, winning the event and marking the third-best finish in the women’s triple jump nationally this year. 
Sophomore Kaelin Roberts blew away her competition in the women’s 200-meter dash to the tune of a 0.48-second margin of victory. Roberts’ 22.97 finish ranks first among NCAA sprinters this season. Junior Mecca McGlaston and Hall — two Trojans who primarily compete as hurdlers — seamlessly transitioned to the 200-meter dash, finishing fourth and fifth in the 19-woman field with times of 23.70 and 23.72, respectively. 
The defending NCAA champion USC women’s 4×400-meter relay team, this year comprising junior sprinter Kyra Constantine, Terry, Russell and Brewer, earned third place with a season-best time of 3.339.21.
On the men’s side, freshman Sam VanDorpe completed a Trojan sweep in the 800-meter dash, winning the event with a time of 1:51.64. 
Sophomore hurdler Cameron Samuel extended the Trojans’ prolific results to the 400-meter hurdles, registering first place at the Trailblazer Challenge and the fourth-fastest time in the NCAA this season with a time of 51.25 seconds. 
The 4×400-meter team of freshman sprinter Eric Allen, junior distance runner Matthew Myrtue, Samuel and Jewett rounded out the weekend’s action with the Trojans’ final victory; the team clocked in at 3:10.36. 
With the outdoor season in full swing and the USC track and field team aiming to secure another national championship, the Trojans will compete at the California Collegiate Invitational starting Saturday.

Nobody really asked for a Mötley Crüe biopic, but Netflix made one anyway. 
Director Jeff Tremaine’s (“Ridiculousness,” “Bad Grandpa”) latest work, “The Dirt,” was released Friday. It’s a fictionalized documentation of the careers of rock-and-roll bad boys Mötley Crüe. The movie is based on the band’s collective autobiography of the same name, but unfortunately, all of the poetry and emotional libido that made the book so beloved is lost in translation. 
The film follows the life of the notorious rock group’s leading powerhouse members: Tommy Lee  (Machine Gun Kelly), Nikki Sixx (Douglas Booth), Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) and Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon), as they rise to fame, abuse it, lose it and attempt to regain it. All the antics the band members were known for are present on screen, including under-the-table sexual escapades, trashed hotel rooms, casual laughs with Ozzy Osbourne and devastating struggles with heroin addiction. It’s high-octane ecstasy that moves at the speed of the group’s guitar riffs. 
However, like many of the band’s songs, the sweet aura of the plot fades quickly and the demand for more substance is left unfulfilled. Each of the band members occasionally narrates from their book, which serves as an indistinct guide to the members’ conflicts and intentions. Luckily, a lot of these voiceover monologues are rich in prose and rather fun to listen to. But, when the high wears off, the scenes drag, and it seems as if everyone involved is just half-heartedly meandering through them. 
The story mainly belongs to Sixx, whose anger and fractured family relationships provide the central dramatic arc. While Sixx wants to make it out of the manic sludge of his life, Neil is there to serve as the foil to his pulsating extremes — a devil on his shoulder that reassures him glory can last a little longer. There is no angel for Sixx. The closest thing he has to one is Mars, but his character is only given one decent monologue throughout the film’s 107-minute run. 
Nevertheless, Rheon deserves praise for his small performance. He has the responsibility of portraying the only bandmate with even an ounce of maturity or wisdom, despite the film’s manifesto seeming to want to show off as much moronic, dangerous behavior from its protagonists as possible. It’s a thankless role, and Rheon’s subtlety helps the movie avoid many pitfalls. 
Tremaine is also probably the only possible director who can keep the rocky ship that is “The Dirt” afloat. His experience directing the hilarious “Jackass” saga proves advantageous in this film. In fact, arguably the most shining moment of the entire thing is a riveting montage where the audience sees what a day in the life of the band is like. It’s gross yet deliciously over-the-top, somehow managing to make mouths water and skin crawl at the same time.
But “The Dirt” has significant missteps, too. The movie strays away from the true narrative of Mötley Crüe for no reason other than to make static events a hint less boring. The film even acknowledges this in a scene where the band’s manager punches out a doped-out partygoer, then immediately breaks the fourth wall to say, “This didn’t actually happen.” It’s a grin-inducing moment, but mutating reality — often a mortal sin in biopics — feels pointless. This is especially insulting when the movie decides to dive down the rabbit hole of heroin addiction. Cataloguing such a heartbreaking internal monster deserves tasteful nuance and a strong grip on reality. Unreliability is the last thing it needs.
There’s a desperate lack of surprises in this uninspired film. It’s the most formulaic musician movie possible and, worse, it doesn’t seem to care about its subjects. The apathy that went into making “The Dirt” is palpable. The voiceovers feel like cheap storytelling devices rather than valid additions. The pacing is inconsistent, and the actors seem disinterested in their roles. “The Dirt” is steadily unremarkable and callously calculated. It’s impossible not to walk away feeling disappointed.

Why is horror so enticing? It’s quite the paradox to be drawn to something — a TV show, a book, a movie — that’s intended to make us look away. But we relish that. It’s part of the experience of watching a scary movie to look away, cover your eyes, ears or both. We want to be terrorized by serial killers, creepy clowns, clones of ourselves and the supernatural — from a safe distance, of course. 
When projected onto the silver screen, these threats are neutralized and subdued by a filmmaker who is playing off our deepest fears. We pay them $13.50 a ticket to do their worst on us, and usually it is their worst. 
Horror isn’t a historically respected genre; it’s just cheap thrills and jump scares to give an audience goosebumps, right? There are some movies, however, (and many that we’ve had lately) that surpass a cheap, schlocky aesthetic and frighten us precisely because they are so well-made. It’s kind of absurd to say a horror movie can be “realistic,” and they aren’t, but they represent fears that are — the better their execution, the more we’re duped into thinking it’s all real. 
Take “The Silence of the Lambs,” for example, the most awarded horror movie ever. Led by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, it’s one of only three movies to win the “Big Five” Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and Picture). So if we’re purely looking to awards to crown the best in the genre, “The Silence of the Lambs” is it. 
One of the most basic screenwriting rules is “show don’t tell.” Yet,  “Silence of the Lambs” does exactly the opposite: characters verbally expound Dr. Hannibal Lecter’s inhuman exploits, which we rarely see on screen. Director Jonathan Demme leaves us to our own imaginations, and naturally, we imagine the worst. Demme creates an environment where it’s okay to think taboo thoughts — despite being the scum of human morality, the magnetic Dr. Lecter is someone we love to hate.
Horror doesn’t always have to be an individual endeavor, however. “Get Out” — a modern spectacle that helped kick off the horror renaissance we’re living in today — capitalizes on our collective fears. We are terrified for our protagonist Chris immediately after his soon-to-be father-in-law Dean Armitage utters the words: “You know, I would’ve voted for Obama for a third term, if I could.” The Armitage clan represents a collective we know exists but we are afraid to fully confront; it’s terrifying (and intentionally absurd) to watch the Armitage family traumatize Chris with their diabolical ways — at the same time, it’s what we all want to see on the screen because only there can we watch from a safe distance.
These two films frighten us because they force us to acknowledge how vile humans can be. Granted, brain transplants and brain eating are extreme examples, but that’s the point: How can we be so intrigued by this? How can these terrible images be the iconography of a multi-billion dollar industry?
We step through the looking glass when we watch any movie, drifting further away from our reality into another. Horror works because it shows us what our reality could be. Terror comes when we ask ourselves, “What if?”
In one of Jordan Peele’s sketches with Keegan-Michael Key, two friends walk out of a horror movie making boisterous claims about how none of it was scary at all; yet, as they make their way to their cars, they carefully avoid puddles, trash cans and dogs just in case all the things in the film were real. This is precisely what horror films do to us — we can all remember watching something scary as kids and then running quickly through dark places in our homes to avoid being grabbed by the demon’s hand. 
Horror movies allow us to experiment with what we fear might be real, whether that fear manifests in monsters, killers or demons. Humans watch (and make) these movies to grapple with those fears. In the end, we like to be thrilled, but what we like even more is knowing that the hairy hand can’t really break through the screen to grab us. We like jumping out of our seats, but a silver screen of separation is as close for comfort as we’re willing to get. There’s pleasure in fear, but there’s more pleasure in being assured by movies that those fears are (probably) not real.

Charleston-based indie rock band Susto headlined the Troubadour Friday night to promote its latest album “Ever Since I Lost My Mind.” Dealing with themes of travel and long-distance relationships, the album marks a more personal turn compared to the band’s previous works.
Singer Mel Washington opened the show for Susto with nothing more than his voice and an acoustic guitar. While his set was short, Washington took listeners on an intensely personal journey through homelessness, uncertainty and aging. At times, he would stop strumming to let his rich voice fill the room, putting the  rawest version of himself on display.
When performing “Dirty Hands,” he invited Justin  Osborne of Susto to join him on stage. The two exchanged dialogue about working hard to support themselves as musicians and taking pride in the sweat and labor they poured into their craft. As they sang the final chorus, the two musicians took a victory lap to celebrate the effort they each put into building their careers so that they could stand before a crowd far away from their hometowns.
Musical group Frances Cone took the stage next and switched things up with its soulful brand of indie pop. Dressed in a long robe that looked more suitable for sleeping than performing, lead singer Christina Cone weaved her impressive voice through harmonies and textured keyboards on songs like “Arizona” to create a dreamy atmosphere. 
When Susto took the stage, the band seemed constrained as the small space prevented the musicians from moving. However, the intimate venue complemented Susto’s style in a way a larger venue could never replicate. Many of the band’s songs dealt with relationships and reflections in life in the American South, often making use of clumsy yet endearing imagery to get the point across. 
The title track from Susto’s latest project “Ever Since I Lost My Mind” exemplified the benefits of cultivating a more intimate performance space. The quirky sentimentality of the track translated to a live setting with ease.
“If I Was” pulled back most of the band and focused on Osborne’s voice for one of the more personal moments of the evening. His voice not much louder than a whisper, the singer imagined how different his life would be if he had chosen to pursue a different career. 
Osborne brushed up on his Spanish-speaking for “Esta Bien.” While one of the least complex songs performed lyrically, the track resonated with a universal message of contentment and love. Its simple, endearing message, backed by warm guitars, united the crowd singing along, whether they were fluent in Spanish or only chiming in with the titular phrase.
With its frightening and violent imagery, “Dream Girl” whisked the crowd into a nightmarish fantasy. The confusion and desperation of the song was juxtaposed with Susto’s laidback performance, creating a sense of unease that permeated the sleepy guitars.
A shout out to Los Angeles in “Home Boy” electrified the crowd during one of the standouts from the more upbeat numbers. The guitars bounced with a reliable groove, thrashing around Osborne’s steady yet charismatic vocals.
Saved for the encore, “Chillin’ on a Beach with My Best Friend Jesus Christ” offered a comical and earnest break from the usual affair between electric guitars and drums. Basked in purple light, Osborne sung with only the keyboard backing him up. This allowed for the biggest sing-along moment of the night, as the crowd and Osborne both imagined what it would be like to drink Bud Light with Jesus without a care in the world. 
That awkward and down-to-earth image encapsulated what made the evening special: The band’s willingness to share itself with its fans without restraint.

This month, USC was rocked by scandal once again. Once dubbed the “University of Spoiled Children,” the school is now being ridiculed as the “University of Scandal and Corruption.” So-called experts across the country are jumping in with ideas on how to prevent such scandals from continuing. Some of these “experts” have raised — or rather, re-raised — the question of whether standardized tests are necessary and whether they create inequity for those who do not have equal access to study materials. FairTest, a group that advocates for test-optional admissions systems, said this latest scandal “may be the final straw that tips the balance” for more schools to adopt test-optional admissions policies. 
But leveraging the admissions scandal to support test-optional admissions is flawed logic. Rather than explaining why standardized testing is obsolete and painting an inaccurate picture of whether students are prepared for college, the recent scandals demonstrate the exact opposite: We need tests. But just like FairTest’s name states, we need to make them fair. In other words, standardized tests have to be standardized. And right now, they aren’t. 
The Department of Justice in 2011 uncovered a number of wealthy students attempting to hire people to take the tests for them. For all those who got caught, there are likely hundreds who didn’t. The most recent scandal involved parents bribing SAT proctors to change answer sheets or take tests in place of students.
I’m not arguing that low-income students can afford the same tutors, resources and have the time to study for these exams as wealthier students. There is no denying that students who come from financially secure families do not have to work parttime,  watch over younger siblings or care for elderly family members like many students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
But think of the alternative to test-optional admissions programs. Calling for schools not to consider standardized testing for college admissions would be a mistake. In fact, it would make the situation worse for students who attend less affluent high schools, where grade inflation is lower than at private schools. A Fordham University study found that the median high school GPA rose 0.27 points in affluent schools but just 0.17 points in less affluent ones between the 2004–05 and 2015–16 school years. 
So imagine the following scenario: There are two students, one from a wealthy background and one from a poor family. The wealthy student goes to an elite, private high school that charges tens of thousands of dollars in tuition per year. The low-income student goes to public school in a poor neighborhood. Let’s also assume that this particular student is far more prepared for college-level classes and rigor compared to her wealthy counterpart. She finishes with straight A’s and aces her SAT. The wealthy student also finishes with straight A’s from a grade-inflated private school but doesn’t do too well in the SAT. 
If colleges did not demand SAT scores, both these students would appear similarly academically qualified. A standardized test, however, would distinguish one over the other, assuming it really is a “standardized” test. The problem arises when the wealthy student is awarded test-taking benefits that other students are not. With benefits like extra time, taking the exam in a private room or having someone else take the exam, the test is no longer standardized. 
This is not to say that students with learning difficulties should be denied conditions that make their test-taking experience fair. But allowing a student who does not have a learning difficulty these same conditions would be unfair, and according to The New York Times, it just so happens that some communities have well-known psychologists who will provide paperwork attesting to disabilities — for thousands of dollars. At some elite high schools, over 46 percent of the student body has been diagnosed with learning disabilities — allowing them to spend up to twice the amount of time most students are allocated on the SAT. Nationally, only 13 percent of students have learning disabilities. ABC News reported that a California psychologist admitted that he diagnoses a learning disability in nearly 90 percent of the cases he evaluates. He also charges over $1,500 for an evaluation and has a special “fly-in” service for national exposure. 
The College Board released a 2016 report in which it found that the better students performed on the exam, the higher their first-year college GPAs were. There appears to be a correlation between course grades in particular classes and students’ corresponding SAT section results.
The test, of course, isn’t perfect. But the problem isn’t the test itself; it’s the fact that it is not being administered fairly, and it is helping a certain class of students overwhelmingly more than others. The recent federal indictments are a handful of specific cases that represent a problem much larger than any individual case and a system of corruption that has faced little accountability. It’s about time we hold those rigging the system accountable. When cheaters get caught, is our response to blame the test or to blame the cheaters? Certainly it should be the cheaters.

Last week, Interim President Wanda Austin announced USC’s lowest acceptance rate in history — 11 percent. As admission to USC grows more competitive, the USC community must address systemic inequalities present in standardized college entrance exams. Children from affluent backgrounds simply have more advantages when they take such tests — advantages that are prominent in their test scores. 
Standardized testing was founded on racism and class inequality. College Board, the organization that administers the SAT, created their tests based on ones used for the United States Army, according to PBS Frontline. These tests were initially developed to determine those who could be considered “mentally inferior” and unfit for military service. 
“During World War I, standardized tests helped place 1.5 million soldiers in units segregated by race and by test scores,” the National Education Association said. The tests were scientific, yet they remained deeply biased.
A study published in 1923 by Carl Brigham, one of the men who created one of the original tests, wrote that the so-called “American Intelligence” would not develop further “owing to the presence of the negro.”
Now the test, more commonly known as the SAT, is used as a metric for admission by most colleges. 
While Brigham’s boilerplate racism is one of the past, students of color continue to be discriminated against, even in the creation of test questions. Education Weekly writer Catherine Gewertz studied SAT results in 2017 to look at trends among students of different races taking the test. 
“Hispanic and African-American students score significantly below [the average composite score],” Gewertz found. 
The National Center for Fair & Open Testing, commonly known as FairTest, also reported that students of color score lower on standardized testing used in college admissions. Lower scores impact their ability to secure merit-based scholarships, contributing to the racial gap in college enrollments and completion, according to the NEA. Consistent low scores for minority groups create not only a systemic cycle of racial gaps, but also a psychological one — the NEA reports that the use of high-stakes testing affects test takers’ emotional and psychological states, causing poor performance and a dismal academic outlook. 
SAT tutoring also perpetuates economic inequity in testing. While very few students paid exorbitant amounts of money to cheat on these tests, many affluent students have access to expensive test prep that drastically improves their scores. Elite Test Prep near Arcadia High School, the high school that sends the highest number of students to USC, offers a morning SAT prep course that costs $2,740. While seeking out tutoring for academic achievement is not inherently wrong, doing so places lower income students who cannot afford such test prep at a noticeable disadvantage. 
This economic inequality is represented in the student population of USC. A recent study by The Equality of Opportunity Project found that USC was falling behind its California peers in enrolling students whose family incomes were in the lowest 20 percent.  Because the SAT is unfairly biased against minority students and those of lower socioeconomic classes, the University must champion students from lower income households, especially those from communities around USC.
The SAT cannot truly measure student aptitude due to its deep historical roots in racism and its present-day propensity to disadvantage minorities and those of lower socioeconomic classes.
On the USC Admission Center website, the University claims to review every application comprehensively and holistically. As USC admission becomes more competitive, the University must recognize the racial and economic barriers some of its prospective students face. While a standardized test score is not the only consideration in assessing an applicant, maybe it should not even be considered at all.
