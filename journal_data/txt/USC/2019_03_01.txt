As a longtime contributor to legacy news organizations, former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson wanted to learn how new media outlets — like BuzzFeed and VICE — solidified themselves so quickly as authorities in digital literacy. So, to find out, she wrote a book. 
In a conversation hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Friday, Abramson discussed her reasons for writing the controversial book, as well as what she has learned in her over 40 years as a journalist. 
“Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts,” which was released on Feb. 5, follows four media outlets — The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed and VICE News — as they adapt to changing journalistic standards in the 21st century. In the last two months, however, the book has been subject to numerous claims of plagiarism. 
Several journalists took their concerns to Twitter, highlighting passages in Abramson’s book that appeared to have been copied and pasted with little to no attribution and contained factual errors that several interview subjects said she never clarified with them. VICE correspondent Arielle Duhaime-Ross tweeted that Abramson incorrectly referred to her as a transgender woman in the book.
“I’m not trans,” Duhaime-Ross wrote on Twitter on Jan. 14. “During our chat, I told her I’m a queer, gender non-conforming woman. She didn’t ask for an explanation. She didn’t ask for my pronouns.”
In the conversation with Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy director Geoffrey Cowan and School of Journalism director Gordon Stables, Abramson said she does not think the accusations have damaged her credibility or the book’s. 
“When you make a mistake … if it’s making something up … that clearly is a firing offense,” Abramson said. “But short of that, what is the proper thing to do? Correct something right away.” 
Abramson said she has made numerous corrections in the book’s online version, which will be reflected in the printed second edition. Copies of the first edition were available to purchase for signing after the event.
Abramson also claimed that VICE mounted an opposition campaign against her book. Abramson did not acknowledge that the claims of plagiarism did not only come from VICE reporters. 
“I’ve called almost all of the people who I knew were mad from VICE,” Abramson said. “Some of those were painful conversations. I was sincerely sorry. I take responsibility for these errors — I take them very seriously.” 
Abramson began working at The New York Times in 1997, and served as executive editor from 2011 to 2014. Prior to the Times, she wrote for TIME Magazine, The American Lawyer and The Wall Street Journal. Abramson, who was the Times’ first female executive editor, spoke about her experiences with sexism in the workplace. 
“When you get to the top, there’s a real double standard,” Abramson said. “The very qualities that women are blasted for having when they get to be number one are seen as leadership qualities in men … When you get to the top job, your likability … goes plummeting.”
Abramson was fired in 2014 for various management issues and for allegedly lying to New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger during her search for a new co-managing editor. After her termination, Abramson said she became interested in understanding how young news organizations operate in a period of technological innovation.
“[The New York Times] was kind of dripping with envy for these new, shiny digital news startups, specifically BuzzFeed and VICE,” Abramson said. “I wanted to see, have these new digital startups really figured it all out? … And are they providing quality news?”
Abramson said she was curious about how non-legacy news outlets developed their standards, ethics and training for a new crop of diverse, young journalists. Abramson, who is currently a lecturer in Harvard University’s English department, also expressed concern about current journalism students’ ability to learn the importance of high-quality reporting.
“For you students, the survival of quality news — well-reported, where journalists have done everything to dig up the truth — is really in danger now,” Abramson said. 
While she agrees that Trump’s anti-press rhetoric has contributed to the further polarization of media and demonization of journalists, Abramson said she is even more worried about the state of democracy. 
“I don’t like to talk about these things as ‘us poor journalists,’” Abramson said. “It’s not about the journalists. It’s about democracy and the health of democracy.”

Shannon Grady always had a hard time paying attention in class. But when she was diagnosed at 24 years old with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Grady said she felt relieved. 
Grady, now a 48-year-old dental student at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, said ADHD makes it difficult for her to learn as quickly as other students. 
“When you’re told all the time that you’re not smart, or when you’re failing your classes and people treat you differently because you’re holding them back … it’s disheartening,” Grady said. “It just made me realize that I wasn’t dumb — I was different.” 
Growing up, Grady was often sent to the principal’s office for acting restless and talking to other students in class. Getting into trouble became routine for Grady.
“I just felt like, ‘Oh, here I go again. I’m in trouble again,’” Grady said. “I wasn’t mad. It was just more irritation because I never really understood why I was in trouble because I didn’t see myself … as teachers saw me as being disruptive.” 
Before attending USC, she said she was put on academic probation at Grossmont Junior College. While Grady said she enjoyed her classes, she continued to receive low grades. After trying various types of medication that didn’t work, she said a doctor prescribed Ritalin to help her focus. That was when things started to change. 
“I could think, and I could hear and I could pay attention to what was around me,” she said. “That next semester, I had to fight academic probation to get back to school, and I started getting A’s and B’s. If you look at my transcript, there’s a huge difference.” 
Grady worked as a dental hygienist and manicurist while earning her undergraduate degree in business management. In 2010, she got her graduate degree in education from Northern Arizona University. She then spent six years working on prerequisites and studying for entrance exams before getting accepted to Ostrow.
She chose USC’s program because of its focus on public health and helping underserved communities, rather than preparing students to conduct their own experiments and research. 
“USC is all about the community and about giving back and helping [those] in need … and that’s everything that I do,” Grady said. “[Some dental schools] want you to come out and be research-ready, but that’s not me.”  
While she takes medication to help stay focused during classes and exams, Grady said she still takes longer to learn than her peers. To address this problem, Grady listens to lectures repeatedly and rewrites her notes to retain the course material. 
Roberto Nochez, one of Grady’s dental school peers, studies with Grady and helps her prepare for exams. 
“I told her that when we’re doing exams that she had to slow down,” Nochez said. “She had to consciously tell herself, ‘I have to slow down.’ Otherwise, [she makes] mistakes … [on] simple stuff [she] should’ve gotten right.” 
Grady said that whenever she falls behind in her classes, she said she meets with her teachers and tells them she needs to learn the information differently than the other students.
“I’ve butted heads with instructors because of that, but … it wakes them up, and they’re like, ‘She obviously wants to learn, let’s take the time to teach her,’” Grady said. “And it’s amazing, the respect you get from somebody that has all this knowledge, and they want to share it with you, but they don’t know how sometimes.” 
To concentrate and get her work done, Grady has learned to study in quiet environments and stay organized. She carries a calendar with her and writes down everything she needs to do to stay on track for projects and other assignments.
“I struggle with [ADHD] everyday, but it’s not debilitating,” Grady said. “It’s something that I have to work on every day, but I don’t let it take over my life because then I’ll get nothing done.” 
Dryden Granger, another dental student, said he thinks Grady’s struggles with ADHD have made her more empathetic, a trait that comes through in her interactions with patients. 
“I think that [she] would see a side of people that a lot of us will never understand and can’t see,” Granger said. “I see an empathy in [her] when [she deals] with … patients.” 
Nochez said Grady has strong communication skills and the natural ability to talk with patients and make them feel more comfortable. 
“Here in dental school, you’ll see a lot of people,” Nochez said. “They have a hard time communicating, but [for] her, it just comes naturally. She just talks to everyone, and she’s able to keep up a conversation.” 
Grady also spends her time volunteering with organizations like Ayuda, a nonprofit aimed at empowering youth with diabetes through peer leadership and international volunteers. When she went on her first volunteer trip to Mexico in the summer of 2014 to aid children with cleft palates, Grady said she knew she had to change her life to continue helping others. 
“I downsized my life so that I could afford to live … a life of giving,” Grady said. “I find more satisfaction in that … I want to be able to provide and give to others because I’ve had such a great life.” 
While Grady said she doesn’t have any long-term goals, she wants to continue her volunteer work and use her knowledge of dentistry and healthcare to assist others. 
“When I graduate, … what I’m going to do is go back to my community where I’m from, and I’m going to be able to help those people as well,” Grady said.

For Kevin, the journey to sobriety was lonely at first. But going to group therapy three times a week at the United University Church helped him realize that other students undergo similar experiences.
“My early sobriety was put into perspective because there were other people who had more time than me or people who had less time than me,” said Kevin, a senior majoring in economics. “It gave me a community that allowed me to get sober, stay sober and not have to [go down] the road alone.”   
Kevin, who requested partial anonymity due to privacy concerns, found solace at The Haven at USC, a student recovery community that came to campus in 2013.
“That community  allowed me to one, see other college students in sobriety . . . but two, allowed me to make friends outside of the group that I already have,” Kevin said.  “I owe absolutely all of my sobriety now to them. They were the group, and still are the group, that allowed me to come to terms, but also allowed me to flourish in my sobriety.” 
Kevin’s experience seeking support at The Haven is not unique. At the University’s request, The Haven expanded its programming this academic year to support more students. The Haven now offers three new programs: The Haven Mentoring and Monitoring Program, The Intensive Outpatient Program and the USC Brief Alcohol Screening and Interview for College Students and Cannabis Screening and Interview for College Students.
The BASICS/CASICS program is an educational outlet for students who have had alcohol or cannabis-related incidents at USC. Through two individual sessions that help students examine their own relationship with substances, BASICS/CASICS provides personalized feedback tailored to students’ specific situations. 
In most cases, students are referred to this program by USC’s Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, coaches or members of the Greek community, often due to a specific incident or a pattern of misconduct related to alcohol or drug use.
The USC BASICS/CASICS education and prevention program was first announced mid-semester during Fall 2018 at the University’s request, and it is now officially in full operation for the spring semester. 
The Haven last expanded in 2013, when the Center opened its doors at the Office of Religious Life. Prior to that, the student recovery center was not affiliated with USC. It was a residential program held on the roof of Gateway Apartments for students seeking substance abuse help. 
Currently, the organization helps students in recovery, as well as those who want to discuss their alcohol or drug use. Weekly meetings are still held every Sunday evening but now take place at the Office of Religious Life.
Sophie Pyne, case manager and group facilitator at The Haven, said its mentoring and monitoring program uses a harm reduction model that gives students the chance to look at their relationship with drugs and alcohol. She said it allows students to honestly engage in dialogue about their habits with mentors and peers.
The Addiction Center reports that roughly 31 percent of college students across the United States have exhibited signs of alcohol abuse. The Haven’s three new programs aim to decrease these numbers on USC’s campus. 
“The Mentoring and Monitoring Program is a harm reduction program . . . [We would] work with them and determine what is a good plan for you — what would you like to do,” said Rebecca Udell, clinical director of The Haven. 
The Haven’s website states that the Mentoring and Monitoring Program helps students, parents and school administrators promote education and mentorship regarding substance abuse and misuse among college students. 
“[The Mentoring and Monitoring Program] allowed me to check in on where I was at,” Kevin said. “And more importantly, [it] kind of forced me to get honest.” 
According to Pyne, the Intensive Outpatient Program is a service to help students whose substance addiction begins to take over their lives — the program runs nine hours each week. Through group and individual therapy, along with academic advising, students are able to stay in school while also seeking treatment for their addictions.  
Kevin has been involved in the Intensive Outpatient Program for a few months now, where he has received mentorship and advising from The Haven staff and professionals.  
“[The Intensive Outpatient program is] bridging the gap [for] students who had to leave the University to take medical leave,” Pyne said. “They were actually able to stay on campus and get treatment while they were still in school.” 
Udell said The Haven helps integrate students back into the University community while also ensuring that they receive adequate support. 
“[The Intensive Outpatient program is] a place where they’ve got that support,” Udell said. “And so it’s like the next step — they reintegrate into the academic setting while having a nice hub in the sober community,”
The Haven is not strictly an abstinence program. Instead, it serves as a tool to give students the chance to start a discussion about their relationship with drugs and alcohol. 
“[The Haven gave] me a chance to finally start to put my [life] together and therefore put my sobriety together,” Kevin said. “That was the cornerstone on getting my life back on track.” 
Since joining The Haven in 2018, Kevin has remained six months sober. He is set to graduate in May.

I remember my jaw dropping in 2008 after hearing about the Detroit Tigers’ massive 10-year, $300 million contract with Miguel Cabrera. I was a little kid and Cabby was my hero — I thought he deserved all the money in the world. 
In retrospect, I realize just how much money $300 million is. But somehow, it felt like he deserved it. He was a franchise player, the face of the Tigers and an asset to the team. 
The MLB has money, and it isn’t afraid to spend a little extra cash if it means keeping a franchise player like Cabrera around. After all, he did become the first Triple Crown winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. 
Last week, third baseman Manny Machado signed a $300 million contract with the San Diego Padres, signing the most valuable free agent contract in the history of the Major Leagues. It just doesn’t make sense.
Don’t get me wrong — I am a Machado fan. Correction: I am a huge Machado fan. As a fielder, Machado is one of the smoothest, most fluid defenders baseball has seen. His web gems consistently fill my Twitter feed, each one more amazing than the last. He’s good, but he is not worth $300 million. His contract makes no sense for so many reasons. 
Machado swallows up anything hit to him and has a cannon for an arm, but he lacks the hitting numbers to make me feel comfortable having him as a part of this roster. The Padres haven’t risen above a .500 record since 2011, and for most of the years since then, they have lacked any semblance of half-decent talent.
Second, the farm system for the Padres is currently solid and they should have no problem bringing up new talent or acquiring players from other teams to beef up their roster over the coming years. But I don’t see the appeal of hiring Machado to stand out on the diamond alone for a couple years until that happens. 
In stark contrast, outfielder Bryce Harper finally signed with a team. For $330 million over 13 years, Harper will anchor the outfield at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. This deal makes so much more sense than Machado going to the Padres. 
First, the price seems comparable to the added value to Phillies will receive. At nearly $25 million per year, Harper’s contract is on par with players like Giancarlo Stanton with the Marlins in 2016. 
Second, Harper is in good company. This past season, the Phillies looked like they had a shot to move past their multi-year slump; that didn’t happen, however. The Phillies continued to be the depressing, slightly-below-average team they have been for a while now.
Philadelphia’s strength is in pitching. The team’s starting rotation is solid all-around with Jake Arrieta, Aaron Nola and Nick Pivetta, to name a few. The squad of slingers posted the league’s ninth-best era, at 4.40 in 2018. But it wasn’t supported by the team’s hitting, as the Phillies had the 15th best in the nation. The Phillies posted an 80-82 record finishing 10 games behind the division-leading Atlanta Braves.
Harper is one of those guys that makes clutch plays. He is an asset to have on any team and brings a level of swagger to the game that is sure to light a fire under the team and its fan base. 
My gut tells me that this is the year they figure it out. Last year, things were new and full of promise. 2019 is the Phillies’ year.

After losing to No. 6 Oregon and No. 9 Oregon State last weekend, the women’s basketball team looks to close out its regular season with a pair of wins when it hosts Colorado and Utah this weekend.
The Women of Troy faced Colorado and Utah on the road in early February and narrowly defeated Utah 84-80. This victory against the Utes, who were ranked No. 19 at the time, showed the Trojans’ ability to compete at a high level despite a lackluster conference record. But following the win over Utah, USC came up short against Colorado, whose victory against the Trojans marked their first conference win.
Utah fell to UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State following its loss to USC, although it bounced back with commanding victories against Washington and Washington State. Colorado maintains a poor conference record of 2-14, despite picking up a conference win against Washington State.
The Trojans’ record has also taken a dip recently following a three-game losing streak against Pac-12 opponents. This does not bode well for their Pac-12 tournament campaign, as they would hold the ninth seed out of 12 if the tournament were to start today.
“We’re over moral victories at this point,” senior guard Aliyah Mazyck said following the Trojans’ loss to Oregon Sunday. “These [conference games] are games that we need to win, so the fact that we aren’t winning them is tough. But we’re thankful for the experience and the exposure, and we just need to keep growing and make sure we capitalize on these next two games.”
In their last meeting with the Buffs, the Trojans struggled with consistency. While they shot above 60 percent from the field in both the first and third quarters, the team averaged just 29.4 percent and 23.5 percent in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. 
As they face the Utes, the Trojans must keep an eye on senior forward Megan Huff, who poses a threat on both sides of the ball. Huff leads her team with 19.6 points per game this season and averages 6.9 defensive rebounds per outing.
However, Utah’s offensive firepower is not limited to Huff. The Trojan defense should also focus on stopping freshman wing Dre’Una Edwards, who is shooting 54 percent from the field this season. The Trojans cannot afford a repeat of their poor defensive performance on Sunday, in which they gave up 96 points to Oregon. 
This weekend marks the last regular season competition for the Trojans’ seniors, including Mazyck, who has established herself as both a scorer and team leader this season.
“As a senior on this team, I have to provide leadership,” Mazyck said. “I just try to provide it through example [by] being consistent, playing intense, playing both sides of the ball, defense and offense.”
As her final season comes to a close, Mazyck intends to leave everything on the court and to encourage her teammates to do the same.
“I definitely want to go out with a bang,” Mazyck said. “I hope we can all go out on the right foot and win these games and keep that same intensity going into the Pac-12 tournament.”
The Trojans will compete at Galen Center this weekend, facing the Buffaloes 7 p.m. Friday before taking on the Utes at noon Sunday.

Men’s basketball fell to UCLA 93-88 Thursday night on the road in overtime. The two teams came into the matchup with identical 8-7 conference records, and this crucial loss saw many lead changes throughout, but ultimately, the Trojans couldn’t close it out. 
USC and UCLA were tied 82-82 in the final minute when senior forward Bennie Boatwright missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer to send it into overtime.
“We tried to put the ball in our guys’ hands that brought us here,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “You can’t get upset, everybody succeeds and fails sometimes.”
The Trojans came out cold in the first minutes of overtime, allowing UCLA to take a lead. But USC countered with two big 3-pointers by freshman guard Elijah Weaver and Boatwright before UCLA sophomore guard Jaylen Hands hit a game-sealing 3-pointer that put the lead out of reach for the Trojans.
“It was a great college basketball game,” Enfield said. “We just came out on the short end.”
USC defended well in the opening minutes of the game, preventing UCLA from scoring on several occasions despite open opportunities. The team also established the presence of junior forward Nick Rakocevic from inside, accounting for 4 early points. Through the first four minutes, USC held a 9-4 lead over the Bruins. 
The Trojans were physical on the offensive glass, collecting six offensive rebounds to UCLA’s three. Boatwright embodied this trend with an assertive put-back dunk to give the Trojans a 16-11 lead through the first seven minutes of play. 
However the Trojans failed to stop the Bruins on the defensive end, as UCLA found open looks on many 3-point attempts. Despite the Bruin’s strong 3-point presence, USC stayed in the game and took a 33-32 lead off a short-range field goal from freshman forward J’Raan Brooks. Brooks was crucial in this first half with 9 points on 4-5 shooting. 
“[Brooks] has been through a tough transition, playing behind one of the best players in the country,” junior guard Jonah Mathews said. “He came in and gave us a big lift.”
The teams continued to trade off the lead, with both sides going on significant runs. Despite poor defense against the 3-pointers, the Trojans kept pace with efficient ball movement. USC had totaled 11 assists and merely one turnover, but UCLA was ahead 41-38 at the end of the first half.
Porter opened up the scoring for the Trojans in the second half with an aggressive lay up. He then displayed a strong effort on the defensive end with a powerful block on a 3-point attempt. Porter highlighted his commanding early second-half play with a steal and dunk to give the Trojans a 48-45 lead three minutes into the half. 
Mathews was an offensive force from beyond the arc, hitting three crucial 3-pointers. However, UCLA countered Mathews’ scores with their own, bringing the game to a 51-51 tie with 15 minutes remaining in regulation.
Boatwright showcased his veteran presence with the Trojans trailing by 9 with three key 3-pointers and an assist to senior guard Shaqquan Aaron. USC found themselves down 68-67 as the game approached its final seven minutes of regulation.
Boatwright finished his last conference matchup against UCLA with 25 points, 15 rebounds and six assists followed by Mathews’ 17 points. Aaron and Weaver led the team in assists with seven each. 
USC will go on the road to face off against Utah Thursday night. The Trojans have two games remaining and hope to close out their season strong due to the significant Pac-12 tournament seeding implications.

“The Masked Singer” aired its two-hour finale Wednesday night, concluding an nine-week run for Fox’s reality show (or, rather,nightmare). 
For those who’ve been living under a rock, the premise of “The Masked Singer” is this: 12 celebrities, draped head-to-toe in elaborate animal costumes, sing songs as they compete to stick around for another week. In each episode, one contestant is eliminated by popular vote until the last animal standing in the finale is crowned the winner. 
The word “celebrity” here is used very loosely though, as every single person involved in the show is at best C-list. In fact, the contestants’ mere agreement to be on “The Masked Singer” is tantamount to an admission that they’re washed up. After all, if their career were flourishing, they wouldn’t have the time to be shepherded around set wearing an oversized visor and a black hoodie emblazoned with “Don’t Talk To Me.” 
The panel of judges doesn’t fare much better; it consists of anti-vaxxer Jenny McCarthy, former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, comedian Ken Jeong and singer Robin Thicke — hardly Hollywood aristocracy. 
The judges, though, had no such reservations about shooting for the stars, as they threw out Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid as guesses for who was under the sexy alien mask sporting skintight pink latex. It’s understandably seductive to imagine the world’s top supermodels moonlighting on this ridiculous show, but the sheer implausibility can’t be denied, and it’s inevitably a little disappointing when the celebrities reveal themselves as not a member of the glitterati but someone kind of … lame. 
The guest judges, however, helped restore a slight measure of sanity. The show invited Joel McHale, J.B. Smoove and Kenan Thompson to join in on the fun, all of whom played the straight man to the panel’s enthusiastic embrace of the crazy. Perhaps tellingly, each guest found it imperative to mention just how weird the whole charade was, while making the same “What the hell did I just watch?” face as viewers at home.
“The Masked Singer” is based on a South Korean show called “King of Mask Singer.” But whatever lent the Korean show its entertainment value (which, clearly, was popular enough to merit an American remake) was lost in translation. Asian reality shows have a decidedly quirky bent, but their antics, when replicated for a Western audience, take on a tinge of menacing eccentricity.
Another glaring flaw with “The Masked Singer” is its weed-out method. For a singing competition that eliminates contestants strictly on the basis of their vocal talents and performing prowess, it seems like a no-brainer that the seasoned actor-singer-dancer triple threats would have a distinct advantage over the football players and the socialites. If the contestants were forced to perhaps navigate an obstacle course or write and deliver a five-minute stand-up, it would have probably leveled the playing field. 
Without spoiling anything — in case this article prompts someone to immediately binge all nine episodes on Hulu — the so-called “clue packages” only served to reinforce the rock-solid hypotheses as to who’s under the masks instead of providing new hints. After all, Twitter had already (correctly) guessed the identities of all the remaining contestants by the fourth or fifth week. 
And yet, the show kept its audience locked in. 
“The Masked Singer” obviously possesses some sort of je ne sais quois, considering its debut was Fox’s highest-rated for an unscripted series, and it just got renewed for a second season. If you enjoy “American Idol” and the board game Guess Who?; if you’re a closeted furry who yearns for mainstream media to validate your lifestyle; if you want proof that we have, in fact, stumbled into the dark timeline and everything that’s happened since the 2016 election is the product of a collective fever dream — then look no further than “The Masked Singer.”

If you’re anything like me, you chose USC over other institutions for its unseasonably warm Southern California weather. Growing up on the East Coast in freezing temperatures, my peers and I faced months of snow, ice and wind, with a typical winter lasting through the end of March. While inclement weather comes with its own challenges, one of the biggest obstacles I faced back home was the inability to wear some of my favorite spring pieces until the weather finally warmed up. 
Although Los Angeles has been unusually cold lately, spring is just around the corner, so here are some of the trends I’m most excited to try out. While spring trends are constantly changing, there are a few that recur in storefront displays and my personal wardrobe every year.
One highly debated personal favorite spring trend of mine are Birkenstocks. As you might have guessed from the name of my column, I am a huge fan. From the classic two-strap style to more stylish editions, Birkenstocks are a spring and summer staple for me that never disappoint. With the brand now expanding, I have tried many different styles and have yet to find a sandal that doesn’t impress me. Sadly, I have had to put my obsession on hold for the past couple months due to the weather, but I could not be more excited about breaking out my spring staple piece. However, a similar trend of Teva style “dad sandals” has recently graced a few runways, and while it is a look I’m indifferent toward, I am interested to see how people will incorporate it this spring.
Another staple spring trend for me is pastel colors. Some personal favorites I’m excited to wear this upcoming season are light yellow and blue. While these trends are popular pretty much every spring, I have loved the new combinations of colors and styles currently being produced, such as pairing wardrobe essentials like a leather jacket or a great pair of jeans with a pastel accessory or accent piece to create a spring wardrobe without having to purchase too many new items. Whether I’m using these spring tones in jewelry, shoes, a sundress or any other combination, I am always excited about the potential these pastels have to brighten my wardrobe. 
Although it’s a pattern I haven’t worn since middle school summer camp, I am intrigued at the comeback tie-dye has made and am considering giving it another try. The nostalgia and interest factor are two possible reasons for the return of tie-dye, along with the print’s ability to be as bright or muted as possible when paired with with many different looks.  There are many stores stocking the look this season, and after looking at the new tie-dye options from one of my favorite stores, Reformation, I think I may have to purchase an item to get fully into the spirit of spring. 
Despite all the spring trends I am excited about, there are definitely some trends that I’ll be avoiding. The first one is acid-wash denim; while I love exploring different denim styles, I just don’t think this style is worth integrating into my personal style. I have always preferred darker denim for a cleaner look. Although I have appreciated the way that many designers and brands have been styling this trend, it’s not a look I would feel comfortable in.  Also, the highly debated cargo pants coming back is probably not a trend I will invest in. I was never a fan of this trend growing up, so it’s safe to say I’ll be sticking with buying tie-dye and more Birkenstocks this season. 
Although all these trends may be exciting to experiment with to elevate your personal style, my favorite part of spring is by far the weather, no matter what I’m wearing. From tie-dye to acid wash, finding a spring wardrobe that brings happiness is always the most important when it comes to cultivating a personal style. Whatever trends appeal to you should give you the confidence to finish out this semester strong.

The national tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” opened Wednesday night at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre. Trevor Nunn, who directed the original Broadway production and its 2016 revival, directed this year’s production as well. The premise of the musical and its associated spectacle, which was inspired by T.S. Elliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,” has attracted large audiences for years. The original 1982 Broadway production set the record for the fourth-longest running Broadway production in history with 7,485 performances, according to The New York Times. Though the show is notorious for its “love it or hate it” quality, on opening night, the theater was practically full. 
The production follows a tribe of cats known as “Jellicle Cats” (an obnoxiously catchy song of the same name makes sure that their name is not forgotten), as they plan and throw the tribe’s annual Jellicle Ball.  
Most of the show is comprised of songs that introduce different types of cats and shed light on their lives. The cats range from Macavity, a mysterious criminal, to Rum Tum Tugger, an energetic rock star. Grizabella, a cat whose once-glamorous demeanor and appearance have turned decrepit and sad, makes the other Jellicle Cats shy away from her. She begs to Old Deuteronomy, the tribe leader, to be reborn into a new life at the Jellicle Ball.  She sings “Memory” to Old Deuteronomy, one of the most well-known songs from the show. Her appeal succeeds, and she is sent to the “Heaviside layer,” where Jellicle Cats go if they are chosen to be reborn.
In this performance, Grizabella (Keri René Fuller), is the most endearing character of the bunch. Fuller’s strong vocal performance of “Memory” tugs at the audience’s heartstrings, but the overall lack of connection the audience has to any of the other performers makes it hard for the tune to resonate effectively. 
The show also lacks a cohesive plot. It feels like a song and dance revue tied together only by the fact that the characters are cats. However, the dance elements of the show are particularly strong, with some of the most captivating moments occurring in silent partner dance sequences. The entire ensemble keeps up with the physically demanding choreography — they galavant about the stage in an impressively cat-like and agile manner throughout the show.
The cast members also enter the audience during the show, adding an interactive element to the performance.
The musical’s design elements also shine through in the Los Angeles production. John Napier’s scenic and costume design fit harmoniously with Natasha Katz’s lighting effects to create a realistic London junkyard. The use of found objects in costuming and set design add to the sense of playfulness that characterizes the entire production. During the song, “Skimbleshanks, the Railway Cat,” a train is built before the audience’s eyes through the creative utilization of the ensemble, a large sheet of metal, old metal wheel spokes and a cardboard tube. The lighting also matches the heavy ’80s inspiration found within the music and costumes, with neon hues of purple and orange lighting up the stage. 
The strengths of both the design and performance elements are captured in “Magical Mister Mistoffelees.” Mistoffelees (Tion Gaston) is a compelling dancer, adorned in a sparkly bodysuit and LED blazer that seems to magically change color during his performance. Near the end of the number, he seizes control of the string lights that travel across the theater, making them change colors in time with his jacket. 
At the end of the day, “Cats” is what the audience makes of it. Whether you go to marvel at the spectacle of people in skin-tight catsuits and fluffy legwarmers dancing their hearts out, to giggle at the absurdity of these human-like cats with strange names or even to look for some sort of catharsis within the shallow plot line, there is a reason why the production has had so much commercial success over the years. The actors’ collective ability to capture the essence of humanity’s feline friends and perform elaborate song and dance numbers throughout the show is incredibly impressive, and the  spectacle created in the set and costume design only bolster that effect.

I will never forget the day I arrived at the University of Southern California in 1991 — a dream come true for a girl from a small ranch town who longed to attend this prestigious University. The proudest day of my life was the day I first called myself a Trojan.
What was one of the best times of my life, however, quickly turned to one of the worst — an experience that I share with hundreds of women who attended USC and saw former gynecologist George Tyndall at the Engemann Student Health Center. For me, a simple appointment for prescription birth control turned into an deeply inappropriate exam. When he left the room, I felt dirty and ashamed. I look back at the young, naive girl I was, and I ask, why didn’t I fight him off? Why didn’t I scream for help?
In one day, the school I had loved my whole life became a place of shame and fear. My grades suffered, I broke up with my boyfriend because I could not stand to be touched and to this day, I struggle with intimacy in my relationships and find trusting men difficult.
I wish I could tell my 22-year-old self that I had done nothing wrong, but I can’t. What I can do today is help ensure this never happens again. That is why I stood up and put my name on a lawsuit against USC and George Tyndall. By casting off the shame I have felt for the last 25 years and putting my name on this lawsuit, I am showing my daughter that I have no reason to feel embarrassed or guilty. That decision, understandably, is not easy for every woman to make. And that is why I believe the $215 million class-action settlement reached with USC is the right one. 
One part of the agreement that is so important to me is that it provides choice. As sexual assault victims, we were never given a choice. Instead, we were dragged into the darkness of shame, pain and fear. Under this settlement, every woman — regardless of if they choose to share their story or not — is acknowledged as a survivor that should have never been put in harm’s way. 
The settlement also gives survivors a chance to unite for the betterment of an institution we all care about. One of the most difficult parts of my assault was that I thought I was Tyndall’s only victim. Now I know I am not alone; I have thousands of women standing beside me, saying that we will no longer tolerate this terrible behavior. I draw my strength from the courage of the other women who have stood up with me against this sexual predator who stalked the campus of our beloved University for nearly 30 years. 
Out of this strength and solidarity, we have developed what may be the most important part of the settlement — a series of changes in policies and procedures that USC must implement so that this never happens again. I am relieved that the young women who attend USC in the future will be safe and have avenues for reporting misconduct if it does occur. I was brushed aside when I complained, and I want that to change for future Trojans. 
After years of carrying this weight alone, this settlement represents closure for me. It ensures that USC is held responsible for this decades-long failure to protect students. 
I was able to choose whether to put my real name on the lawsuit or to file as a Jane Doe. While I hold no judgment against the women who chose to file as Jane Doe, it was important for me to use my real name because I know Tyndall does not remember me. I’m just one of hundreds of his nameless, faceless victims. 
I put my name on this lawsuit because I wanted Dr. Tyndall to hear this: My name is Shannon O’Conner, and in 1993, you held me down on an exam table against my will and sexually assaulted me. You violated your oath as a doctor to do no harm when you violated my body. I was intimidated and afraid, and I have been living with my shame, silently, for nearly 25 years. But I will never be silent again. I will speak up loudly to hold USC responsible and to help ensure the University keeps its students safe. 
By being a part of this settlement, I am fighting for a better future for my alma mater and its students. USC is an extraordinary university that boasts learning at the highest level, exciting experiences and significant opportunities for young people. I will always be a Trojan, and that means I fight on for USC, so it will again be the school I once loved for years to come.
