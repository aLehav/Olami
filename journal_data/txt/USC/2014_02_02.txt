The USC men’s basketball team ended a disappointing road trip on Saturday night with a 78-66 loss at the hands of the Oregon Ducks. The loss came just two days after the Trojans (10-12, 1-8 Pac-12) fell to Oregon State 76-75 in a devastating overtime contest. With losses to both Oregon schools, USC has now lost eight of their last nine games and fallen to last place in the Pac-12 conference.

Junior guard Byron Wesley’s 19-point effort led the way for the Trojans who kept things interesting in the first half. On Saturday the team grabbed a 12-6 early lead thanks to Wesley’s sharp shooting, but could not keep the Ducks (15-6, 3-6) at bay for long. The two squads would trade the lead for the rest of the half, with USC taking a 38-34 advantage into the break. Other key first-half contributors for the Trojans were senior center Omar Oraby and senior guards Pe’Shon Howard and J.T. Terrell. Oraby excited the visiting crowd with a key slam dunk to give the Trojans a three-point lead late in the half.
The second half was not nearly as promising for an inconsistent USC squad. Strong play from the Oregon backcourt combined with crucial mistakes would kill the Trojans’ chances for a second conference victory. The team finished the game with a season-high 22 turnovers.
Oregon clinched victory midway through the half with an impressive 12-0 run, sparked by excellent play on both sides of the ball from guards Joseph Young and Jason Calliste. Young added six steals to his game-high 21 points, while Calliste chipped in with 18 points and two steals of his own. The Ducks would finish with 16 team steals, one short of a school record. Oregon stretched its lead to as much as 17 before USC closed the gap to 12 in the final minutes.
Terrell would end up with 15 points for USC, while Oraby added 10. Howard, whose missed free throw late in the overtime period was crucial in the team’s loss at Oregon State on Thursday, finished with eight. Freshman guard Julian Jacobs led the team with nine rebounds.
The Trojans have lost three straight after an impressive home win over the Cal Bears, who defeated previously-unbeaten No. 1 Arizona Saturday night. The team now returns home to face archrival UCLA next Saturday in a 7:30 p.m. tilt at the Galen Center. The Bruins took down the Trojans 107-73 on Jan. 5.

The phrase “USC recruits USC” is thrown around a lot by Trojan football fans and analysts. It refers to the belief that regardless of who the coach is, the University of Southern California football team will always attract talent. As arrogant as Bruin fans might find this notion, it is fairly accurate.
Whether the coach was Paul Hackett, Pete Carroll or Lane Kiffin, USC has always been able to recruit top-tier athletes. As signing day approaches, it appears that head coach Steve Sarkisian will not be the one to change this trend.
A heralded recruiter in his own right, it is no surprise that Sarkisian is putting together an impressive group of highly touted prospects. And though a nationally ranked class is to be expected, signing day carries a lot more significance than usual this year.
Wednesday marks the first true test of Sarkisian’s tenure. Up until this point, the former Washington coach has done everything right, from his introductory press conference to plucking Ricky Town right out of the hands of college football’s supreme power, the Alabama Crimson Tide. But even though these feats are admirable, they don’t foreshadow the trajectory of the program like this inaugural signing day will. Yes, USC recruits USC — but with varying methods.
Pete Carroll, the most successful coach in recent years, was able to dominate the fertile grounds of Southern California, convincing guys like Steve Smith and Matt Barkley to don the Trojan uniform. He also became a force nationally, going into the backyards of other national powers and picking up talented Trojans like Brian Cushing and Fred Davis. This approach proved successful for the majority of Carroll’s time at USC.
Lane Kiffin, on the other hand, strayed from this recruiting methodology. Whether it was the sanctions or a desire to compete with the SEC, Kiffin was obsessed with recruiting nationally. This certainly panned out with guys like Nickell Robey and Leonard Williams, although the chase for other five-stars, namely Jalen Ramsey, Matthew Thomas, and Seantrel Henderson ended up detracting from the Trojans’ efforts in Southern California.
All too often over the past three years, Trojans have watched southern California high school athletes excel for the likes of California, Washington, and Arizona State. Time and time again, fans were left thinking while watching those guys, “Why aren’t they at USC?”
That is why Wednesday is so important: The day will tell us a lot about the direction of the Trojans’ program under Sarkisian. If the entire group of verbal commits sign their letters of intent on Wednesday, USC will start off on the right foot. And the class would receive an enormous boost if both JuJu Smith and Damien Mama commit, as reports indicate is an almost certainty.
Coveted recruits Adoree’ Jackson and Michiah Quick might end up at Florida and Oklahoma respectively, which does take some of the luster off a great class. There is no question that the electric and game-breaking athleticism of Jackson and Quick would be tremendous assets to the USC program. But even if the two athletes go elsewhere, it shouldn’t diminish the immense significance of Sarkisian’s first class. Make no mistake: this class will serve as a firm foundation for the Trojans’ future.
Carroll’s best teams were dominant on the offensive and defensive lines in addition to having talented skill-position players. With a large portion of the incoming class dedicated to both sides of the line, USC will be in a position to replenish and solidify those units.
Additionally, this class is replete with talented defensive backs like Jonathan Lockett and John Plattenburg Jr. There are also a bevy of talented athletes — Ajene Harris, Jalen Greene or Rahshead Johnson — who could see time in the defensive backfield.
It is also highly likely that USC brings in Lamont Simmons, a physical cornerback from Florida. Having a deep rotation of talented defensive backs who can play single coverage man to man will free up Justin Wilcox to run an aggressive scheme that puts relentless pressure on talented Pac-12 quarterbacks.
In addition to addressing deficiencies in the program, Sarkisian is making a major statement about his recruiting strategy with this class. He is going to win with blinding speed and overpowering strength, mostly through the efforts of California athletes.
Re-opening up the Loyola High School pipeline was a major victory for USC with the addition of Chris Brown. Ajene Harris is an underrated prospect from Crenshaw High School, which has recently produced Marcus Martin and Hayes Pullard. Sarkisian is maintaining great relationships with Southern California stalwarts such as Mater Dei and Serra, while fostering connections with up and coming powers Narbonne and St. John Bosco. This is a recipe for success.
Sprinkle in the occasional out-of-state player from Arizona, Texas or Florida and Sarkisian is cooking up a potent combination reminiscent of Carroll’s heyday. When sanctions are lifted, there is no doubt that the coach will expand his efforts nationally, producing even stronger classes. Thankfully, it appears that Sarkisian understands the importance of maintaining inroads in Southern California, and not just chasing alluring five-stars across the map.
There is no knocking the immense talent of last year’s recruiting class. A lot of those of those players will make significant contributions at USC and have long professional careers. Building a class like that, however, leaves one vulnerable to injury and transfers. It creates talented teams that win 10 games but leave a little too much on the table.
Sarkisian’s approach is to build into a dynasty with a solid base that will begin its journey on Wednesday.
And if this signing day is any indication of what is to come for Trojan football, then I’m very excited.

The USC men’s tennis team capped off a sweep of two SEC powerhouses this weekend with a 4-0 upset over the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs Saturday and another 4-0 victory over the No. 11 Florida Gators on Sunday to conclude the Pac-12/SEC Showdown Tournament held at Marks Tennis Stadium.
Smooth operator · Junior Yannick Hanfmann was key to the Trojans’ success over the weekend, not dropping a single set in singles or doubles. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Florida, despite losing Spencer Newman to a badly sprained ankle, brought a steady performance, but were unable to overcome the Trojans’ field of veterans.
The matchup to watch was on court one, where senior Ray Sarmiento and junior Yannick Hanfmann were up against Florida’s Stephane Piro and Michael Alford. After a slow start, with Florida winning the first game, Sarmiento and Hanfmann came back strong. Despite going down and seemingly turning his ankle, Hanfmann was able to shake it off and dominate the rest of the game; Sarmiento and Hanfmann went on to win the second game, and the rest of the set. Taking the doubles 6-3, the USC Trojans were able to get themselves on the scoreboard first.
In his singles set, No. 10 Sarmiento went up against Florida’s Diego Hidalgo. Sarmiento was still able to keep his cool, and secure a 6-2, 6-2 lead.
Sarmiento showed his strengths in numerous solid backhands, serves and volleys showing not just his power, but his skill. Sarmiento controlled the points with excellent shot placements and being aggressive toward the net.
“[I was] making a lot of balls and working the point until I got that absolute short ball and I could come in and finish the point off,” Sarmiento said.
Hanfmann also showed his maturity this match, as head coach Peter Smith credited the pair’s success as helpful in taking pressure off the other doubles teams.
Other powerful players were freshman Connor Farren and junior Roberto Quiroz, whose combined forces allowed the duo to take out Florida’s Maxx Lipman and Gordon Watson 6-2. The duo completed the first doubles match, showing both efficiency and ease in their game. Both were able to close out convincingly, and both were able to carry their leads into their singles sets.
In his singles set, Farren was ready to wrap up his match early, hitting his stride in the second set and defeating Lipmann 6-5 (5), 6-3.
Despite the lopsided victory, Coach Peter Smith was displeased with some of his players’ attitudes in Sunday’s match against Florida.
“To be honest I thought we were soft — I thought we played soft today,” Smith said. “As a team, not every single guy, but I felt like a few of our guys came out maybe looking for someone else to do the job and to me it’s completely unacceptable.”
Smith refused to state the names of the players who upset him, but he was unreserved in his compliments of Sarmiento.
“I’ll tell you what: Raymond Sarmiento, that guy has turned into a man and I’m so proud of him,” Smith said. “He’s really, really grown up and I would say probably the biggest change I’ve ever seen in one of my players. Really, really I mean that was great tennis he played.”
Asked about his coach’s glowing comments, Sarmiento was flattered and sounded determined to continue his strong play this season.
“That’s a pretty big compliment coming from [Smith],” Sarmiento said. “It’s a mindset, I guess. I just kind of changed my mindset and my mentality. I’m really being more patient out there and using my legs a lot more and just staying in the points that much longer.”
Smith, Sarmiento and the rest of the USC men’s tennis team will look to keep up their high standard of play Friday at 1:30 p.m. against conference rival Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif.

Double trouble · Senior forward Cassie Harberts’ double-double (22 points, 11 rebounds) wasn’t enough to power the Women of Troy over the Huskies on Sunday. The loss is USC’s third in a row. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
The USC women’s basketball team could not overcome an early deficit and lost its third straight Pac-12 game on Saturday, falling 63-55 to the Washington Huskies. The Women of Troy (14-9, 7-4 Pac-12) started their conference slate with a 7-1 record.
“We put together a game plan for the opponent and we just let the chips fall where they may,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke.
Much to the dismay of the Women of Troy, the chips did not fall in their favor yesterday. The squad seemed outmatched from the start, falling behind 10-0 to begin the game. Washington, on the other hand, shot a lights-out 41 percent from the field in the opening half. Led by guard Jazmine Davis, the Huskies would go on to nail eight three-pointers through the course of the contest.
A dismal shooting performance doomed USC in the first half, as their first basket did not come until nearly four minutes into the game. That score came from senior forward Cassie Harberts, who once again led her team in scoring and rebounding. Harberts notched her second straight double-double with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Harberts is averaging 16.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game, both team-highs.
Junior guard Ariya Crook also attempted to spark her team on the defensive side of the ball, recording several clutch steals in the first half. Crook, who is second on the team with an average of 16.0 points per game, would also reach double digits with 13 points.
Even with these strong performances, the Huskies would hold USC to just 17 points in the first half.
In the second half, USC looked like a different team, cutting a 14-point deficit to seven just 10 minutes into the half. The Women of Troy continued to chip away for the remainder of the game, even cutting Washington’s lead to just two with under a minute and a half to play. Senior forward Desireé Bradley provided two key threes down the stretch to boost the Women of Troy’s chances, while Harberts and Crook remained solid.
Unfortunately the team would not get an opportunity to tie the game, and foul shots allowed the Huskies to edge out a somewhat comfortable win.
Davis led all scorers with 25 points. Huskies’ guard Kelsey Plum added 14, and her teammate Aminah Williams led the team with 14 rebounds.
This week presents an opportunity for the Women of Troy to complete the season sweep of crosstown rival UCLA. The two teams face off in a 3 p.m. battle at the Galen Center on Saturday.
USC will then travel to the Pacific Northwest to take on the Oregon schools beginning Feb. 14.
Teams are supposed to get better as the season progresses. They are so inconsistent except for Harberts.
They play out of control way too much thinking it is playground ball. Who on the coaching staff has been
involved with a solid winning program?

Monique Sosa Allard, the new assistant provost for Student Engagement in USC’s Student Affairs department, recently made her return to the ranks of the Trojan Family.
Welcome home · Assistant Provost Monique Allard returns to USC hoping to get students more involved in campus affairs. – Photo courtesy of Dietmar Quistorf
 
Allard first joined USC after earning her bachelor’s in social work from California State University, Los Angeles. She then enrolled in the USC Rossier School of Education to earn her master’s and doctorate. Before serving as the associate director of college advising in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences from 1998-2007.
For the past several years, Allard has been working in student affairs on different college campuses. She was the director of student services for the College of Education at California State University Los Angeles, as well as the executive director of Student Support and Equity Programs at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.
Happily back at USC for the past three months, Allard is enjoying her new position.
“I am very happy to be back at USC,” Allard said. “I feel like I’m coming home.”
Allard’s extensive professional experience in student services has fully equipped her for her role in student affairs, but it is really her passion for helping students that makes her a fit for the position.
“From as far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in a helping profession,” Allard said. “I really enjoy the opportunity to help students mentally achieve their educational dreams and also to develop and grow and go out and move on to the next stage in their life.”
As assistant provost, Allard works with various areas across campus including campus publications, fraternity and sorority leadership programs, the Trojan Marching Band, campus recreation sports, student government and the Volunteer Center.
“There’s a number of different opportunities for students to be engaged across campus,” Allard said.
As an alumna, Allard said she understands the importance of student engagement at USC. Allard was involved with what is now called Graduate Student Government when she was a student.
According to Allard, her engagement with GSG led her to many important relationships.
“It was a wonderful forum where I met so many of my friends that I still stay in contact with now, several years later,” Allard said. “They really have been my lifetime friends.”
Allard said her experience as a student at USC informed her understanding of the importance of student engagement.
“If you asked any student walking across campus if they thought being engaged was important, I’m certain they would say yes,” she said.
Allard said by getting involved, students have the opportunity to learn important life skills.
“Our students still are looking for opportunities to develop their leadership skills, develop their practical skills, connect with others, build friendships and give back to the community and communities around the world,” she said. “Engagement is really important in helping students develop as a whole person.”
Since her return, Allard has been working on several initiatives regarding student engagement, including implementing the revised student events policy and outdoor events policy, as well as assembling a hazing prevention consortium of representatives from across campus to improve existing hazing prevention efforts.
Though she’s eager to make important changes to enhance the student experience while keeping safety and practicality in mind, Allard said she’s most looking forward to collaborating with students.
“I’m most excited about working with our students, specifically our student leaders,” she said. “I think our student leaders are energetic and full of ideas and inspiration.”
Allard stressed it was very important for her to stay in contact with the student body.
“I consider it my job and the job of Student Affairs to amplify the student voice,” she said.
As a former USC student, Allard holds her role as a Trojan close to her heart.
“I’m proud to be a Trojan and part of the Trojan Family, and to contribute to the Trojan legacy.”

Heritage Hall is officially open to the public beginning today, Feb. 3, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The 80,000 square foot, $35 million renovation project took a little more than a year to complete. The building will house five teams, and connect to the John McKay Center through a bottom floor corridor. On Saturday evening, a private gala was thrown to honor the new building’s debut.

A study led by Sarah Townsend, assistant professor of management and organization at the Marshall School of Business, discovered a new mechanism for coping with stress.

The study asserts that those in a stressful situation will benefit from discussing their feelings with those who are in a similar emotional state.
Townsend’s study involved analyzing 52 female undergraduates who were paired up into teams of two for a public speaking exercise. The students were then told to prepare for and deliver a speech that was taped on video with their partner.
Before their speeches, the participants were encouraged to discuss their feelings on the upcoming task. At this time, as well as during and after the recorded speeches, researchers measured each student’s level of cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone,” which is released by the adrenal glands during the body’s fight-or-flight reaction to stress.
USC News reported that, according to the study, the results showed “that sharing a threatening situation with a person who is in a similar emotional state, in terms of her overall emotional profile, buffers individuals from experiencing the heightened levels of stress that typically accompany threat.”
Having people in similar situations is key to the intended results.
‘When you’re facing a threatening situation, interacting with someone who is feeling similarly to you decreases the stress you feel,” USC News reported.
Marshall professor Trudi Ferguson, a lecturer in management and organization, discussed different coping mechanisms for stress in the workforce.
“My personal experience is that stress can be reduced by grounding to validate people’s feelings, basically taking a step back and putting the project or presentation into context as to how big of a problem it actually is and will it matter a month from now,” Ferguson said.
In addition to this study, Townsend is also spearheading a new Culture, Diversity and Psychophysiology Lab at Marshall.
“My intention in the CDP lab is to get a group of graduate students and graduate research assistants to develop and run studies of high-impact research,” Townsend said. “As the name suggests I am interested in cultural differences and how people’s backgrounds shape their behavior, perceptions of the world, expectations and values, which in the end can lead to important benefits for future business leaders.”
In an interview with USC News, Townsend went on to mention the future possibilities of her study in creating a better workplace.
“We’ve found that emotional similarity is important,” she said. “So now the question is: How do we get people to be more similar? What can you do to generate this emotional similarity with a co-worker? Or, as a manager, how can you encourage emotional similarity among your team?”

Saturday, Feb. 1st marked the 112th anniversary of Langston Hughes’ birth, as well as the beginning of Black History Month.
Joined by actor/poet Malcolm Jamal Warner and four student musicians acting as the latest iteration of the Ron McCurdy Quartet, Dr. McCurdy honored the work of Langston Hughes by adapting his 12-part jazz-poem suite “Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods For Jazz” in Bovard Auditorium.  The event was hosted by USC’s Visions and Voices program. The piece is not one of Hughes’ better-known works, due partially to the fact that he passed away before he could perform it. Now, 54 years after the penning of “Ask Your Mama,” McCurdy and his team have blended 21st century musical, poetic, and cinematic media to realize Hughes’ ambitious artistic vision in ways that would never have been possible when he was alive.
Many remember Warner as the teenage son “Theo” from The Cosby Show, but he has been busy since, making a name for himself through other artistic paths. As the bass player and front man of the group Miles Long, Warner takes a Hughes-esque approach to his art by standing at the intersection of poet and musician. Setting his spoken word pieces to the jazz/funk sounds of his band, Warner refuses to be defined by one or the other.
“I feel like I’m an artist. I’ve been very blessed to have different avenues with which I can express my art … express myself, really,” Warner said. “Obviously, acting is a big part of what I do and it’s my first love. You know, that’s how I make a living, but it’s also nice to have music be a love, a passion and a viable way to express myself in ways that I cannot necessarily do as an actor or a director.”
Though he left the bass playing to a student performer, Warner showcased his diverse vocal talents during passages that turned from spoken to sung. As an artist and performer, Warner prefers to operate in the liminal zone between forms.
“Obviously [poetry and music] are two different forms of expression,” Warner said. “In poetry, there’s a lot of musicality. So I think the poetry and music dynamic can work very well together. You know, being a bass player, this piece was that much more intriguing because [Hughes] was working with Charlie Mingus. So, you know, poetry, jazz, bass — that’s all … that’s me all day long.”
The pressure to give a proper tribute to Langston Hughes — as well as the risks inherent in adapting it to live performance — seemed not to hold back any of those involved. The main drawback of spoken adaptation is that Hughes’ densely nuanced and subtle tricks of language go by quickly. If they are not heard and understood correctly the first time in a live performance, they are lost to the listener, whereas a reader could go back.
On the other hand, McCurdy and Warner’s familiarity with the text and the historical context of Hughes’ work often enhanced the understanding of those in the audience who were not quite as familiar. During his reading of “Mood 1: Cultural Exchange,” Warner brought to life Hughes’ fantasy of black icons being named to public office. The pause for emphasis during his description of them idly “sitting on their wide … verandas” implied the joke of what else they were sitting on. These subtle cues are only picked up with repeated study of the poem, and the audience members who had never heard it before greatly benefited from their inclusion.
There are plenty of comedic passages in the original text, and the laid-back dynamic between Warner and McCurdy did these passages justice. As per usual with Langston Hughes, however, there is a certain darkness to this humor, which is often used to make it through hardships of being black in United States. The musicians and poets successfully captured this subtle aspect of Hughes’ poetry. During a light-hearted exchange in which the bald McCurdy drew laughs with his delivery of the line “Hair blowing back in the wind (and I never had that much hair),” the ominous supporting music served as a constant reminder to the audience of the solemn subjects at hand in the rest of the poem.
Though the poets and musicians were constantly entertaining and adaptive, the visual aspect seemed to lag behind at times. Of the three forms employed in the expression of Hughes’ vision — poetry, music and film — the film clips were surely the weakest. Black and white clips from the era of the Harlem Renaissance felt appropriate, but it often deviated to stock footage of peach flowers on a branch or other equally cliché images. At times, the screen merely played a slideshow of images of the musicians mentioned in the poem. This made it seem more like a PowerPoint presentation from a lecture in a jazz history course than an artistic interpretation.
Audience participation was encouraged, fostering a strong interaction with the text.  McCurdy instructed the audience to, “treat the performance like a good ole’ Southern Baptist sermon,” explaining it was all in the spirit of Langston Hughes. No matter their creed or color, everyone who witnessed and participated in the performance has tightened society’s grip on Hughes’ dream, driving away the barren, frozen fields of oppression and ushering in the sunny dawn of freedom promised by the founders of our nation.

As integrated as modern technology has become in our lives, whether it be social networking and the abundance of smartphone adoption, tech companies seem to be prepping for the next step: integrating tech with your body. And while it’s still nowhere from being a widely used tool or even a fashion statement, it seems that companies have found the next two industries to embrace in their products: fitness and health.
One of the first purveyors of bodily modification, Google, continues to develop its pet project Google Glass, introducing different designs, prescription glasses and expanding the program for wider use. With the recent update, one of the concerns Google has addressed is the look of the glases, streamlining it and adding new options for color.
This sounds like a superficial upgrade, but it’s ultimately one of the first hurdles that wearable technology has to overcome: actually looking good, and even being fashionable. It needs to become for head-displays what the iPod was for MP3 players, the iPhone for smartphones, and the iPad for tablets. This is especially true for something you’re expected to have on your face or your wrist.
Speaking of Apple, a recent rumor has emerged that the next iOS is going to renovate the mobile healthcare and fitness industry with a new set of applications, one dubbed “Healthbook,” that’s capable of monitoring and storing fitness statistics, calories burned, miles walked and even weight loss.
The centerpiece of these applications would be the often rumored iWatch, and it seems that its utilization in fitness tracking is that breakthrough clutch that would differentiate this new device from previous failed attempts for a digital “smartwatch,” which were either redundant, had weak computing power, or, to be frank, ugly.
Samsung just recently tried to get a headstart on Apple with its own smartwatch, called the Galaxy Gear, but it failed to catch on with millions of unsold units. The major flaw is that with something like a watch, people for the most part will get a watch for the fashionable aspect of it. A man doesn’t need a watch to check the time as much as an additional accessory . And if it doesn’t look good, no level of digital sophistication is going to matter.
Rather than competing against past attempts at a smartwatch, it appears that Apple, which has been hiring experts in health monitoring and medical statistics, is going after tracking accessories such as Fitbit or the Nike FuelBand. The rumored device will have sensors for heart rate, blood pressure and tracking in sync with the iPhone’s M7 chipset, which has a built-in pedometer.
Now all of this will be for naught if it doesn’t look good. Even if all of the rumors pan out, it will have to be something that can as much of a fashion item as it would a health device and a technological accessory. Someone who’s going to be conscious of their health and appearance tends to be the kind of person who would consider how their watch will look.
Nonetheless, Apple appears to be capitalizing on the fitness monitoring and its application to medical functionality would give it a utilitarian purpose instead of just an accessorized one. The company and others believe that healthcare is the next big thing for consumer technology. Nintendo announced just last week that it’s developing a third platform focused on health, having had great success in this field with the Wii Fit series and Brain Age.
And though technology’s primary function is to relieve the stress of living, people are always on the lookout for something that can be modern and pro-active. By turning these wearable accessories into something that could improve and monitor someone’s health, it pushes itself into something that can be integral instead of excessive.
Ultimately, however, people have to feel comfortable, or even just cool-looking, using these items. Considering the Google Glass still has its skeptics, we’re definitely a few years away from becoming impromptu cyborgs anytime soon.

Good halal food is hard to come by in the Los Angeles food scene: much of it is relegated to cultural enclaves in areas heavily populated by the Islamic community. In New York, however, The Halal Guys have gained a significant following as the purveyors of an affordable, delicious halal comfort food staple: chicken over rice. Last month, the Chicken and Rice Truck opened up shop on the famed Hollywood and Highland intersection Jan. 24 to bring a piece of Manhattan culture to the Hollywood night scene.
It’s all halal · The Chicken and Rice truck is bringing one of New York’s famous food truck concepts to the Los Angeles scene. The truck, which parks at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue from 7:30 p.m. to midnight Tuesday through Sunday and after midnight off Las Palmas Avenue. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Initial reactions have been positive: the Chicken and Rice food truck celebrated its grand opening with a $5 special for a plate of chicken and rice which usually sells for $7. The hungry masses gobbled it up: Chicken and Rice’s twitter (@ChickenRiceLA) apologized for food selling out early the first two nights and continued its $5 a plate promotion through the first three days of opening.
Despite its tourist-friendly location and the inherent difficulty of parking near Hollywood and Highland, the food truck has been able to attract a constant stream of hungry patrons — passersby and foodies alike jostle into a crowd outside the truck one weekday night to catch a glimpse of the city’s newest food craze.
As with most newly-opened concepts, the entire process of ordering and receiving food still seems a little rough around the edges. The crowds put in their order with one of two men standing outside the truck with tickets and pens and then the order is then placed on a service line. The kitchen staff assembles the plates beginning with a large portion of fragrant red rice and top the bowl with a portion of falafel (vegetarian), chicken, gyro-style lamb or a lamb and chicken combination plate. And then the most important finishing touch: all of these ingredients are topped with a rich white garlic sauce and a spicy red sauce.
The result doesn’t look terribly appetizing at first glance — it’s not the most Instagram-friendly plate of food — but a single bite reminds all true foodies to never judge a book by its cover: savory, heavily-seasoned lamb, garlic and spicy pepper sauce all come together to create a salty, satisfying orchestra of flavors. It’s the stuff of late-night food runs, and provided it sticks around, it’s sure to be classic post-club grub for Hollywood revelers stumbling out of the nearby Premiere Supper Club.
Chicken and Rice also offers its meats in burger, gyro, taco and kati roll wrap presentations. Though the truck likens these offerings to a Los Angeles-friendly twist on a New York favorite, it’s difficult not to dismiss these other renditions as gimmicky, half-baked developments. The real reason surrounding the hype is the huge servings of delicious spiced rice.
Speaking of the rice, one of the places where Chicken and Rice falls into trouble is the proportion of meat to starch: there is simply too much rice and not enough chicken or lamb. Of course, at $7-$10 a bowl, it’s hard to fault the truck for skimping on what certainly tastes like very high quality meat. It bears mentioning, however, that the truck could stand to at least fully cover the rice with the meats. Which is to also suggest that the meat is tasty enough to be missed.
Regardless of the truck’s shortcomings, it’s a nearly fail-proof proposition: open up a halal food truck in one of Hollywood’s most storied corners, make the food cheap and consistently delicious, and stay open past midnight. It’s clear that food that is simple, substantive and delicious is always a welcome addition to any city.
It doesn’t take an understanding of Islamic dietary restrictions to know that chicken and rice this good is halal for everyone — not just Muslims or New Yorkers.

Whoever said roots music has no place in Hollywood should have been at The Troubadour on Friday night. A sold-out, noticeably eclectic crowd ranging from Silver Lake hipsters to couples in their mid-fifties packed the historic venue to hear from The Wood Brothers. Comprised of real-life Boulder, Colo. siblings Chris on upright bass and Oliver (guitar, lead acoustics), the band came together after 15 years of  solo acts. With the addition of multi-instrumentalist Jano Rix, The Wood Brothers offered a jazzy Americana sound that even they can’t really describe.

Along with her backing trio The Handsome Strangers, opening act Amy Helm began the night with a refreshing take on a traditional brand of folk music, perhaps best epitomized by her drummer’s use of a washboard in lieu of a snare drum. Her groovy folk sound meshed nicely with The Troubadour’s rustic surroundings, and compelled more than one person to turn from the bar and pay attention. Helm filled the role of an opening act perfectly, but even she knew the crowd was growing antsy for the main act. The Wood Brothers stepped onto the stage at 9:15 p.m. for their hour and a half set, and didn’t disappoint.
Chris’s fingers did the singing to start out the show during a smooth five-minute bass solo. The boys jumped into “The Muse,” the track that serves as the namesake of their fifth studio album released this past October. Their perfectly balanced harmony was raw and unpolished and complimented the song’s theme of a fleeting love. It was also the audience’s first encounter with Rix, who arose as the surprise of the night. Equipped with a tricked out, bell-strapped guitar that he affectionately refers to as a “shittar,” Rix kept a steady and multifaceted beat throughout the entire set, utilizing anything he had that could make a sound. His moment in the spotlight came early on during “Keep Me Around,” a romantic song in which the Brothers’ admittance of desperation is summed up in one phrase, “Will you keep me around?”
The Brothers played two of their hit songs back-to-back, “Wastin’ My Mind” and “Postcards From Hell”. The latter performance was perhaps the most poignant one of the night, and it definitely evoked an emotional response from the performers.
Oliver explained that lyrics like “Set up in a bar room corner / Playin’ for tips and beer / People carryin’ on and drinkin’/ You gotta strain to hear,” are meant as an ode to the struggling musician. “It doesn’t matter if you’re the most famous or at the very bottom,” he said during the concert. “Anyone who’s pouring their heart out onstage deserves to be heard.”
A special moment occurred halfway through their set when the band unplugged and invited Amy Helm back to the stage for an acoustic performance. The crowd listened intensely to the quartet’s cover of “Angel Band,” a 19th century hymn popularized by The Stanley Brothers. The four-part harmony seemed natural and unforced, and the mystique of genuine musicians huddled around a single microphone made for an intimate performance.
The band clearly had an affinity and respect for Helm, and she may soon become a headliner at The Troubadour herself.
After The Wood Brothers played their breakout hit “Luckiest Man,” the crowd got a taste of Chris’s dance moves during “One More Day.” He marched from one side of the stage to the next, keeping a straight face and impressive posture while gyrating his hips and knees.
It was around this time that each member of the band was given his time to shine as the spotlight literally shifted from one man’s solo to the next. The band’s enthusiasm complemented the crowd’s, and was evident in not one, but two encores.
When they stepped back onstage the first time, Oliver offered some of his own thoughts on the band’s sound, “People say we’re blues. People say we’re Americana … what does that even mean? What the heck is Americana?” The crowd howled with laughter, but one can only wonder if it was out of understanding or ignorant confusion.
Overall, it was refreshing to see a band employ the natural tools around them without resorting to electronic effects. The Wood Brothers proved that the authenticity of a worn-down sound trumps a polished studio track any day, especially in an era where over-production is the norm.
 
The Wood Brothers will be on their international tour until May, performing in various venues throughout the United States as well as The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Belgium.

It’s time, once again, to break out that American flag sweatshirt and beer koozie to watch the world’s best athletes duke it out.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
After spending upwards of $50 billion, the Russian government has made the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi the most expensive Olympics to date, topping China’s bill for the Summer Olympics in 2008 and obliterating Vancouver’s $9 billion price tag in 2010, according to Businessweek. Needless to say, this year’s games promise to be an international spectacle.
“Sochi could end up being one of the most-watched Winter Olympics in recent history,” said writer Richard Deitsch in Sports Illustrated.
The predicted spike in viewers, however, might be the result of something other than potential Olympic frontrunners Mikaela Shiffrin and Shaun White. The anti-homosexual stigma of Russian radicals has many fearful of repercussions against more liberal athletes, family members, coaches and those attending the games.
In fact, the controversial decisions to host the Games in Russia and Brazil have the world questioning the security of athletes and spectators alike. Along with reservations about the Russian Winter Olympics, critics feel uncertain about the current social unrest in Brazil, the host country for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games.
So, why have the International Olympic Committee and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association elected to hold their sporting events in socially unstable venues? The answer lies in who ultimately benefits from these decisions.
The decision to hold the games in Russia and eventually Brazil don’t benefit the players or viewers. In fact, many LGBT-supportive athletes who would have gone to the 2014 Winter Olympics have since started a boycott. It was even announced that President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama would not be among the United States’ delegation to the opening ceremony. Instead, the U.S. delegation will include openly gay tennis star Billie Jean King,  sending a strong message of opposition to Russia’s anti-gay sentiment.
The fanfare of the Olympic Games and the World Cup also disrupts the lives of many local Russian and Brazilian citizens. With thousands displaced by stadium construction in 12 of Brazil’s largest cities, riots have sprung up across the nation. Similarly, construction around Sochi has left several hundred displaced including those from a nearby mountain village called Akhshtyr that has been left without a sustainable water supply or public transportation for the past five years, according to The Nation.
The governments of host nations, however, reap many rewards. Politicians in favor of hosting the Olympics believe it produces long-term increases in tourism. Furthermore, the Olympic monuments and stadiums are left for the governments to profit from later, according to CBS News.
And the real win for the host countries is the chance to be the center of the world’s attention, and to leverage that exposure to benefit the countries’ images. For instance, the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing successfully advertised China as a global economic powerhouse. This could be the Brazilian government’s chance to boost its global standing.
This is not to say that reporters and networks want U.S. citizens to be placed in jeopardy, but they certainly would benefit the most from it happening. In fact, Russia’s homophobic laws existed long before the country’s bid for the Winter Olympics back in 2007, but networks only began reporting about it in the United States after the Olympic, five-ringed magnifying glass was lifted up to scrutinize the country for possible news stories.
NBC Sports has had broadcasting rights of the Olympic Games since 1988 and aims to provide an internationally neutral spectacle, but NBC News promises in depth coverage of anything that happens.
“NBC News will be there in full force with all of its journalists and all of its shows to cover news items. We’ve been doing this on an ongoing basis, whether it’s related to security, or as you’ve already seen, as it relates to the LGBT situation that is in Russia,” NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus said in a statement.
No one can say that the major corporations that run these events are in cahoots with country leaders in a symbiotic moneymaking relationship. The decisions to hold these events in unstable places, however, benefit the games’ largest affiliates, while disregarding the safety of the players and fans.
 
Drew Klopfer is a sophomore majoring in critical studies and narrative studies. 
 
One could make the claim that going to university at USC also neglects safety, and the decisions to study there benefit the university’s largest affiliates, while disregarding the safety of the students and the professors, given the university’s location.
Yet, I’m pretty happy that I went there, and as long as the choice to go or not to go is voluntary and not coerced, I don’t see the problem. It should be an enjoyable Olympics and it is good to see these events hosted in a wider range of countries.

Ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and several high-ranking members of the Muslim Brotherhood stood trial last week in a soundproof glass cage on charges of orchestrating a prison break, according to the Los Angeles Times. Though many have slammed the installation of the soundproof chamber as a violation of the former president’s freedom of speech, such a device was ultimately necessary to maintain order and discipline within the courtroom.
Morsi, who has been in jail since he was ousted during a military coup in July, faces four separate court trials on a number of charges, including inciting supporters to commit violence and murder, conspiring with foreign organizations including Hamas and Hezbollah to commit terrorist acts, orchestrating a prison break and insulting the judiciary, according to BBC News.
The utilization of the soundproof cage came as a result of many instances of the former president refusing to comply with courtroom procedures. During his first trial appearance in November, Morsi refused to wear the traditional white prison jumpsuit and proceeded to interrupt the trial by questioning the authority of the judge in open court and shouting that he was the democratically elected president of Egypt and the victim of a coup.
“I am the legitimate president of the country, and this trial is not legal,” Morsi said in court last week, according to NPR.
Though Morsi’s lawyers argue that the installation of the soundproof chamber deprives the accused of their right to hear or participate in their own trial, such measures were ultimately necessary to ensure the trial go smoothly in the first place. Given the interruptive and chaotic behavior of Morsi and his fellow defendants in a previous trial, the implementation of the soundproof barrier was necessary prevent further chaotic disruptions during the second trial. Moreover, Morsi and his fellow defendants were able to hear everything happening in the courtroom, and the judge allowed them to speak by turning on their microphones when necessary and required.
Some civil rights advocates consider the charges against Morsi to be groundless. Yet, even if that were the case, it does Morsi and his fellow defendants no favors to consistently obstruct and delegitimize the serious accusations filed against them. The fact of the matter is that the soundproof cage would not have been necessary during the trial in the first place had they focused on proving the charges against them as invalid rather than resorting to pandemonium. By enabling the defendants to listen and take part in their own trial while also preventing them from interrupting the proceedings, the court is ultimately ensuring that these proceedings take place at all.
As chaos in Egypt continues, it’s time that both Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood take the steps to move away from the mindset that they deserve to be in power when the fact of the matter is that the majority of the Egyptian people supported their removal. Rather than continue to defy the legal system and insist on their leadership, it’s time they face the charges against them.

According to who?
Didn’t the election results clearly show Morsi won?  Since when is this in question?
