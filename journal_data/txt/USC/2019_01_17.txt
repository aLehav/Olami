People love the ability to choose what they do. Whether it be little decisions like deciding to have a salad instead of a sandwich for lunch, or  larger-scale decisions like settling on a summer vacation destination, humans want to change up their lives, as well as have some aspect of control over them.
That being said, USC is known to students around the world as an institution that offers a variety of academic paths. From dense STEM fields to concentrations in the creative arts, there are numerous ways students can expand and explore their interests. Many students insist that general education requirements are unnecessary at USC and at other schools, and say they instead want to hone in on a singular field of study. But students must recognize that getting a holistic education isn’t a burden — it’s a privilege.
At some schools in parts of rural America, enrollment and budget concerns are causing universities to cut liberal arts programs. According to a proposal constructed by University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Chancellor Bernie Patterson, the school is cutting back on majors such as history, French and German as part of a change in agenda toward career-oriented programs. Patterson suggested the plan last November, asserting that removing majors of low interest and increasing an emphasis on majors that feed into careers will be integral to the university’s success moving on. Furthermore, he emphasized that the plan would help boost enrollment and interest, thereby increasing revenue.
While USC doesn’t face the same budgetary concerns as UWSP, cuts like these raise the question of whether or not a holistic education is a vital component of one’s college education. 
It’s a common myth that liberal arts programs supply students with useless skills, rendering them unemployable. However, according to a 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard University, skills fostered by liberal arts such as writing, synthesis and problem solving are actually sought after by employers. In fact, these jobs have seen the largest growth in employment and salary in the last three decades. 
In essence, universities like UWSP are turning toward the polytechnic model and transitioning into a style of education similar to that of trade schools. Students that enroll in polytechnic institutions lean toward vocational and technical studies, pursuing majors such as business analytics or engineering. This allows graduates to obtain degrees that will not only put them directly on a path to the workforce but also help them obtain the degree they need more quickly.
Even though the argument that quickly obtaining a degree and job is valid, a holistic education allows students to discover other interests beyond their career paths. Students are expected to grow and develop their passions, which can be accomplished by taking general education classes alongside major requirements. By immersing themselves in different fields, students don’t have to decide their ultimate goals in life right away. Students are expected to change their minds to fit their best interests. According to a U.S. Department of Education study, about one-third of undergraduate students will change their major at least once within the first three years of their enrollment. If students could only take classes from highly specialized schools, they wouldn’t be able to experiment with their education or pursue diverse fields of study.
Furthermore, limiting the number of major program options for students sets universities on a path of conformity and rigidity. Schools like UWSP are losing touch with history and the past. The polytechnic route does create a steady path toward a career, but institutions, like USC, that offer a wide variety of majors are fostering a new generation of well-rounded and knowledgeable graduates. 
Having the ability to choose one’s major is an essential part of one’s academic experience. If one is looking for a job within a small selection of majors, a polytechnic school might be the best route. USC students should appreciate the opportunities general education requirements and liberal arts programs provide, because they engender growth and self-improvement beyond anything a typical trade school could do.

Former USC assistant football coach Todd McNair was granted a motion for a new trial in his defamation lawsuit against the NCAA Wednesday. The suit has been ongoing since 2011, after the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions brought allegations in 2010 stating that McNair was involved in the Reggie Bush scandal. The NCAA found that Bush, a former USC running back, had received impermissible benefits while at USC, and he had to forfeit his Heisman trophy while the program vacated the 14 wins and national title from the 2004 season.
Last May, a jury sided with the NCAA, stating that the allegations brought against McNair were not defamatory. However, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller wrote in a ruling Wednesday morning that the jury’s decision was not supported by sufficient evidence, specifically citing an incorrect answer in a special jury verdict question meant to draw a certain answer.
“In the court’s judgment, no reasonable trier of fact could have made the determination that the answer to Special Verdict Question 3 should be ‘NO,’” Shaller said in the ruling.
Moreover, the presiding juror, Anthony Bruno, should not have been allowed to serve due to an implicit bias, Shaller said. Bruno is a member of the Latham & Watkins law firm, which was a part of the NCAA’s legal team on the McNair case. However, Bruno had no relation to or role in the case and worked at a different branch of the firm from those involved. 
“Permitting Juror No. 2 to remain on the jury and participate in deliberations … resulted a miscarriage of justice and in [the] Plaintiff being deprived of a fair trial,” Shaller said. 
A week ago, McNair agreed to become the running backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. McNair has not coached at the collegiate or professional level since leaving USC in 2009.

The Trojan track and field teams return to action this Friday when they compete in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational in Albuquerque, N.M. 
Last season saw the Women of Troy secure their place as the best unit in the country — they clinched the national championship title. Kendall Ellis’ effort in the final leg of the 4×400 gave the Trojan women an improbable come-from-behind victory, and with it, their second national title. The men’s team also had an incredible season, finishing fourth in the nation with a record-breaking performance in the 4×400 relay. 
Both the men’s and women’s teams will have to cope with the departure of their best performers from last year, as sprinters Kendall Ellis and Michael Norman have moved on from the team. Both were crucial in 2018, securing numerous individual victories and leading the Trojans to great team success.
Norman was arguably the best athlete in collegiate track and field last year. He was rewarded with the prestigious Bowerman trophy, an award that is presented annually to the best performer in the sport. Norman was a force all year long, dominating in the 400-meter dash as well as in the 4×400-meter relay. 
He broke the indoor world record for the 400-meter dash early in the season, reaching a blistering time of 44.52 seconds, and his dominance in the event carried through every meet of the season. Norman went on to win first place in the 400-meter dash at the NCAA Outdoor Championships with a time of 43.61 — a collegiate record — also helping the men’s 4×400 team win the event with a time of 2:59:00, another collegiate record. Norman made the decision to go pro in July, though he will continue his studies at USC to complete his degree.
Ellis’ departure is also a huge blow to the team, as she was a Bowerman semifinalist herself. Along with her remarkable performance in the 4×400, Ellis took second place in the women’s 400-meter dash with a time of 50.19 and was named a first-team outdoor All-American for the second time. She set a USA indoor record in the women’s 400-meter dash in her first-place finish, running an incredible 50.34 to secure her title. Ellis also won an outdoor Pac-12 title in the 400-meter dash.
The departures of Ellis and Norman, along with other members of last year’s team like Bowerman finalist Rai Benjamin, will undoubtedly hurt. However, the Trojans still have a roster loaded with talented athletes. 
Redshirt senior All-American high jumper Randall Cunningham will return for his final season after winning the 2018 indoor high jump title with a clearance of 7-foot-6. A fractured tibia cut Cunningham’s season short and held him out for the season’s outdoor half. 
Sophomore All-American sprinter Twanisha Terry will also look to improve on a tremendous freshman season, in which she set a USC record in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.99. Named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year in 2018, Terry also earned First Team All-American honors in both the 100-meter dash and the 4×100 relay.

After bringing home the national title last season, the USC women’s water polo team will return to the pool this weekend at the Gaucho Invitational in Santa Barbara.
The No. 1 Trojans will take on six opponents this weekend, starting with No. 22 Cal Baptist and Azusa Pacific on Friday. They will then face No. 11 Michigan and Fresno State on Saturday, before wrapping up the invitational with matches against No. 12 UC San Diego and No. 14 Indiana Sunday.
As contenders in last year’s NCAA championship tournament, Michigan and UC San Diego will provide an early challenge for the Trojans this season. Stopping Michigan’s senior attacker Julia Sellers should be a point of focus for the Trojan defense, as Sellers led the Wolverines with 81 goals in 41 games last season.
The Trojans will also need to get creative on offense to counter Michigan’s defensive fortitude. Junior goalie Heidi Ritner allowed an average of only 6.25 goals per game, helping the Wolverines to outscore their opponents by wide margins.
“We know Michigan,” senior goalie Amanda Longen said. “They’re pretty scrappy, they drive a lot, they keep you on the go and they’re persistent the whole way through the game. It will be a really good game for us to experience and for a lot of girls to work on how they defend.”
Sophomores utility Taylor Onstott and attacker Grace Pevehouse lead UC San Diego’s well-rounded offensive attack. Facing sophomore center Ciara Franke, who had 64 steals last season, will force the Trojans to protect the ball well.
Several notable players from last season’s championship team have been replaced by fresh faces. The Trojans lost All-Americans driver Brianna Daboub and utility Hayley McKelvey, both of whom graduated last spring.
Although the team enters the season without some of last year’s stars, coach Jovan Vavic is confident in the talented recruiting class he assembled during the offseason.
“I think our 2019 class could be one of our best classes ever,” Vavic said. “I think they’re going to make an impact immediately.”
This young talent includes driver Alejandra Aznar and two-meter Mireia Guiral, a dynamic duo for Spain in the 2018 FINA Youth World Championships.
“Alejandra is one of the best young players in the world,” Vavic said. “Her skill set is one-of-a-kind, and she’s unique with her high water polo IQ, scoring ability and her speed.”
Of Mireia, Vavic said, “She is a gamer. She does everything, she’s dynamic, and she can play both sides of the ball.”
The Trojans’ captains, seniors goalie Amanda Longan and driver Courtney Fahey, play an instrumental role in familiarizing these young players with the system. The team has been focusing on integrating their new talent for this weekend’s invitational.
“We’ve been trying to work with them to get them to prepare for this weekend and think about the different things they can do,” Fahey said. “Visualizing doing well in the pool, doing the plays correctly and being creative if that’s the right thing to do.”
Although the Trojans have the potential to gain significant leads over their opponents via talented scorers like junior utility Maud Megens and sophomore driver Paige Hauschild, the team also seeks defensive consistency this season.
“It’s always our goal to outscore the opponent, but we want to keep the other teams to as few goals as we can,” Fahey said. “I think one of our biggest challenges will be communicating and doing a good job on defense to allow the least amount of goals in as possible.”
This weekend’s Gaucho Invitational will be one of many non-conference invites for the Women of Troy this season —they travel to Riverside next Saturday for the CBU Mini Invitational.

The Trojans will travel to Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tenn. this weekend to compete in the Off the Block Grow the Game Challenge. 
With 10 teams competing in this tournament, the Grow The Game Challenge will be the largest non-conference men’s college volleyball tournament this season. USC will take on Lincoln Memorial, Barton and Lindenwood. 
Although all three matches this weekend are against smaller schools — both Barton and Lincoln Memorial have undergraduate populations of less than 5,000 students — the Trojans will be careful not to let size fool them. 
“They’re relatively smaller schools but they’ll bring it,” senior libero Matt Douglas said.  “We’re sure of that and anytime they get a chance to play a big school they really show up and always give us their best effort, so we need to bring it as well. We’ll just bring the same intensity and prepare like we would for any conference match.”
Their first matchup against Lincoln Memorial, which holds a 3-0 record, will take place on Friday. Leading the Railsplitters on both offense and defense are junior setter Evan Cory with 45 kills and 14 digs, and sophomore setter AJ Risavy with 88 assists and 14 digs. 
The weekend will continue with a match against Barton on Saturday. The Bulldogs, which hold a 0-2 record, are led offensively by freshman outside hitter Adrian Iglesias with 20 kills this season. Senior outside hitter Aleksa Brkovic and redshirt junior setter Oscar Fiorentino lead the defense, each with 11 digs this season. 
The Trojans will wrap up by facing off against Lindenwood on Sunday. Redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Charley Hlavin leads the Lions on offense with 26 kills. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Diego Negrón anchors the defense, with 18 digs on the season. Senior middle blocker Connor Hipelius has contributed 11 blocks as well. 
After travelling to Hawaii for three games last weekend, the Trojans will need to heavily focus on mental preparation.
“Mentally more than anything, it’s taxing,” Douglas said. “Making sure we’re ahead on academics, being proactive with teachers, getting our bodies back in shape and getting healthy.” 
With victories over Concordia University and New Jersey Institute as well as a well-fought battle against No. 4 Hawaii last weekend, the Trojans the season on the right foot and brought their hard work during the off-season and preseason to light. 
“I think having that first trip under our belts will be very beneficial for us,” Douglas said. “We know what we need to do as a team, how we need to prepare for matches — all that off-the-court stuff to give us the best possible outcome on the court.” 
Douglas said the Trojans will enter this tournament with the confidence that they can compete with anyone. 
“We’re currently unranked right now, which is a little daunting when we’re playing some of the top teams in the country, but we’ve proven that when we’re on, we’re on, and we can really compete with anyone,” he said. 
Securing that positive mentality, the team works a lot with its sports psychologist, Dylan Firsick, on mindfulness, mental preparation and strength. The Trojans also actively work to turn their catchphrase of the season — “resurgence” — into reality.  
Douglas also gave credit to the team’s new strength and conditioning coach, Kurtis Shultz, for preparing them well for the season. 
“We’re probably all in the best shape of our lives, and I think that’s paying huge dividends on the court,” he said. 
All games will be played at the Dallas Floyd Recreation Center in Lebanon, Tenn., and will be available to stream on the Cumberland Sports Network.

Most of my existence is owed to football — the Kansas City Chiefs in particular.
My parents met at a bar owned by former Kansas State quarterback Lynn Dickey, and my dad popped the question in the nosebleed seats at Arrowhead Stadium. As soon as I was born, I was stuffed into a white-and-red onesie and toted to Chiefs training camp.
Each fall, as the air became less muggy and dense, my mom hoarded McCormick spice packets to prepare for long Sundays of chili cooking in the Crock-Pot and football blaring in the living room. We always muted the ESPN announcers, preferring the talent on our local radio station — the warm astonishment of Kevin Harlan’s, “Oh baby, whatta play!” and the roaring excitement of Mitch Holthus’ cry, “Touchdown, Kan-sas Cit-y!” 
The Chiefs weren’t especially good when I was little, but they were good enough to make me fall in love — hard. Maybe too hard. Even as a kid, I was an overly loyal fan. When the Bengals beat us one year, I attempted to boycott a dance competition I was supposed to attend in Cincinnati the following month. (I lost that argument very quickly, but remained bitter through all three days of the trip.) Even after the 2006 season, when we lost Trent Green and Tony Gonzalez and only won two games, the Chiefs were my guys. 
I couldn’t help it. That team had always been inextricably, permanently part of me. Even my first crush was connected — a boy with shaggy blonde hair named Robbie, who I deemed to be the cutest sixth-grader alive. He also happened to be Kevin Harlan’s son. 
The thing I’ve learned since moving to Los Angeles is that not everyone completely understands what it means to be a fan. It makes sense, really, that in a city privileged with the wealth of stars like Kobe Bryant, with a torrid history of NFL teams that came and went only to return a few years later, fandom would be a casual thing. Los Angeles is a tourist city and its fans’ perspectives follow suit, coming and going like fads, following the ebbs and flows of winning and losing seasons.
But folks from the Midwest know it’s different. Don’t get me wrong, our teams normally aren’t all that good. We suffer through losing streaks, losing seasons, losing decades. The sports gods giveth and taketh away heartily in the heart of America — just ask anyone from Cleveland if you don’t believe me — and most of us know that all good things with our teams will come to an end.
That’s why, last Saturday afternoon, I didn’t believe that the Chiefs would win. I grew up through year after year of the same old disappointment — a stellar start to the season followed by a dramatic crumble into postseason failure. The possibility that the Chiefs could step up and dominate another  I was stunned, rewinding the moments with my mom in a series of clipped, all-caps texts.
And it meant that I had to face a very real, overwhelming possibility — that, with one more win, the Chiefs will play in the Super Bowl. 
I’ve never watched the Super Bowl as an actual fan, instead enjoying the annual excuse to eat a ton of pigs-in-a-blanket and, if need be, shout insults at the Patriots. I’m not even sure how I’ll react if that happens. (Cry? Laugh? Name my first son Patrick, after the Chiefs’ quarterback?)
I didn’t get much time to consider that prospect before one of my friends asked the pessimistic counter — what would I do if they lost? — but my answer was immediate. I won’t care. I mean yes, I’ll be crushed, but it won’t be the type of loss that destroys me as a fan.
As a pessimistic fan, part of me will expect the loss from the first snap. But the rest of me simply won’t care. The team taking the field in Arrowhead this season is one of the best we’ve seen in Kansas City in awhile and, for once, we feel that we might have the upper hand for awhile — the best tight end in the league and a baby quarterback who’s changing the way the position’s played. Regardless, I’ve lived through two-loss and two-win seasons, and I’ve loved this team long enough to know that things will be okay. 
A lot can be said about what it means to be a fan. Yes, fandom makes people do crazy things — paint their chests, stand knee-deep in snow on a Sunday, travel thousands of miles and name their children after strangers. 
But to me, being a Chiefs fan runs deeper. It means a quiet Sunday afternoon in Kansas City with a bowl of chili balanced on my lap, my dad holding his iPad up inches from his nose to read off stats. It means nonsensical texts from my mom — “Did you see that?” and “PAT!!!” were two of the most recent — that I automatically understand. 
Most importantly, it means that no matter what, each season, my family and I can count on the same game, the same field and jerseys and colors that feel like home no matter the record or year. Win or lose this Sunday, and every Sunday after that, the Chiefs are still that something I can count on.

Since Netflix announced that the studio was beginning production for the documentary last year, the film has picked up significant media traction for its promised in-depth analysis of the series of missteps that led to the disaster of Fyre Festival. Hulu’s Monday release was a total surprise to subscribers and critics alike, and — not to get ahead of the curve — it may have already emerged as the superior documentary due to its inclusion of Fyre Festival creator Billy McFarland.
On Monday, Hulu released its feature-length documentary “Fyre Fraud” — the first of two competing documentaries on the infamous failure of a destination music festival that was supposed occur over the course of two weekends in spring 2017. Netflix will release its own take on the incident, “Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,” on Friday.
At first, Hulu portrays McFarland as a relatable, sympathetic figure: a suburban-raised, high-achieving, overly optimistic millennial who may have bit off more than he could chew. It starts off with McFarland reminiscing about his early years as an entrepreneur, from running a second-grade crayon repair business to pitching his first startup idea, a company called Spling, when he attended Bucknell University. 
After dropping out of college to pursue Spling, the bright-eyed McFarland flounders in the financial jungle of New York City. But soon after, with the same ingenuity of his crayon repair business, McFarland takes on a new venture — Magnises — a credit card company called.
At this point, the narrative of tragic wunderkind Billy McFarland is quickly flipped on its head. Viewers soon see McFarland’s true talent — not business savvy, but rather the honed skill for bullshitting. It becomes apparent that, outside of its sleek appearance and a few “black card” privileges, Magnises has absolutely no novel substance as a legitimate enterprise. Still, McFarland lock in a big-time investor: the late Chesapeake Energy heir Aubrey McClendon. 
McFarland, in turn, uses these finances to market the card with hip-hop artists, pop culture icons and social media influencers. Photos of celebrities promoting the card company litter the internet and social media, and, somehow, McFarland’s strategy works. The company finds mild success, customers pour in and McFarland is recognized by New York media as one of the city’s hottest young entrepreneurs.
This initial success, coupled with smart networking and aggressive marketing, bring the audience to the origins of McFarland’s Fyre Media, a booking app that pairs event planners with top talent — a Tinder for event planning. McFarland and his business affiliate, rapper Ja Rule, decide to throw a game-changing music festival that would promote the app to millions across the globe. While on vacation from work, McFarland comes up with the idea of a destination music festival in the Bahamas.
From the very start, locals caution McFarland that an event of that scale and proportion could never be accomplished in just a few months. McFarland and Ja Rule throw these warnings to the wind. McFarland subsequently embarks on what may be the most ambitious social media campaign ever seen. 
Using the latest studies and data on social media engagement, McFarland’s team creates an ad campaign designed to stop as many scrolling fingers as possible. McFarland films an ad capturing influencers, Instagram models and essentially everyone cooler and more attractive than the rest of us having a “Project X”-esque party on a beautiful Caribbean island. The ad, feeding the most glamorous of millennial fantasies, goes live on Instagram with the assistance of these influencers.
This social media blitz came to a fever pitch when model Kendall Jenner posted on Instagram that Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music collective would be on the festival lineup. Fans and followers thought this post implied that West would be performing and, naturally, general admission passes start selling like wildfire. 
At this point, McFarland’s team is so deeply invested in this fantasy festival that they have no choice but to try to execute it. But thanks to the team’s aggressive marketing tactic with little to no actual organizing, the rest is recorded history — a total disaster of a festival that ends with disappointed rich Gen Z’ers getting shipped back to the States.
McFarland himself explains the paradox that is Fyre Festival: It wouldn’t have been such a colossal disaster if its marketing tactics hadn’t been so successful. Never before has an event been as well-marketed and yet so poorly planned. McFarland may have genuinely intended to put on the next Woodstock or Coachella, but he didn’t — he failed miserably. 
At the very core of this documentary lies two pivotal themes: millennial-driven fallacy and the power of influence. It’s an unforgiving, if honest, portrayal of a generational phenomenon called social media. It uses piercing criticism that will make you (seriously, no I mean seriously this time) delete the app.

My Two Cents is a soul food restaurant hidden on Pico Boulevard in Mid-City. There is no ubiquitous sign for the eatery, represented only with a knife, fork and heart poster atop a storefront. A few days ago, I walked into the restaurant and sat down at one of the wooden tables, quickly noticing that scattered along the walls were cultural relics of black America. Cajun and Old Bay seasonings sat on the shelves, while sweet potatoes surrounded a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce — it reminded me of my grandparents’ home, a sweet mixture of culture and soul food cuisine. 
Soul food is traditionally eaten and made by African Americans who live in the Deep South, specifically from the Cotton Belt, which spans across Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. The cuisine originated during slavery, when African slaves were only given food which was deemed by their white masters to be “undesirable.” 
Over time, the slaves combined their traditions from Africa with their limited food options in America and created what is now known as soul food. The recipes were passed down by word of mouth, as slaves were restricted from reading and writing, and then, during the Great Migration — when many African Americans began to leave the South and migrate to northern states — the cuisine began to spread throughout the United States. In today’s age, soul food is typically associated with decadence and comfort.
My Two Cents considers itself to be the latter. Yet, there are many soul food restaurants which can pose themselves as representative of the black Southern food genre, without ever having a true marker of association with the heritage. But as my eyes lingered on the wall, I realized a remarkable aspect which gave this restaurant a different sort of cultural relevance — it was a black-owned establishment.
I noticed this due to the presence of a Tom figurine. More commonly known as Uncle Tom, this is a caricature which originated during the antebellum period and referred to black men who were always eager to serve, who defended slavery and who were deemed to be submissive and psychologically dependent on whites for approval. Immediately, I figured, a black person must own this place — as only a black person could get away with publicly having Uncle Tom décor so close to a Holy Bible.
But I didn’t come here because it was a black-owned establishment. I came here for another reason — the head chef is a black woman, a satisfying, yet still very uncommon sight in the modern restaurant industry. But it is on par with the fight for African Americans to reclaim and commercialize our culture, which white people have already exploited and profited off of for centuries. 
The executive chef’s name is Alisa Reynolds, and she is well-known around Los Angeles. Her fans include Solange and Ava DuVernay, as well as myself.    
Black women are essential to Southern cuisine, as generations of the American South were raised on recipes created by slaves. Today, white people are often the ones who are praised for cooking the food my ancestors created for survival. Discrimination, like in most professions, has always restricted the upward mobility of black chefs, making it hard to achieve success and even harder to reclaim the recipes which have come to define Southern black culture.
Reynolds, who was taught by a French chef, sought to infuse those teachings with her soul roots, creating a Southern comfort menu that serves items such as gluten-free mac and cheese alongside plantain stuffed pork chops.
The first food served is corn bread — the hallmark of soul side dishes, topped with a honey-like sauce on the top. I bit into it, almost expecting to taste chunks of pineapple hidden in the batter the way my grandmother used to make it; sadly, there weren’t any. 
I ordered my meal with an Arnold Palmer, still reserved on ordering sweet tea in places outside of the Bible Belt, recounting the experiences where it was made too bitter, too sweet or as the wrong drink entirely.
The entree I chose was Creole shrimp and corn grits, served in a way I had never seen before. I was used to my mother splattering grits on a plate and with shrimp drowning in a puddle of melted butter. Instead, it came in a wooden bowl, with the corn parmesan grits hidden at the bottom and the Creole shrimp resting at the top.
“Her main recipe is love, hands down,” said Eric Jamal, a server at the restaurant. “This is her art and she cares about the presentation … the flavor.”  
For years, it seems, I have been trying to find a place in Los Angeles that could satisfy my collard greens, fried chicken and okra cravings, and it saddens me that I find such a place four months before I am set to graduate and move back to the East Coast. My Two Cents, a soul food restaurant, black-owned and operated, is reclaiming the African American narrative of this country in bold ways, like putting an Uncle Tom figure near the top shelf for all the white patrons to see. America needs more restaurants like this.

Guitars, pianos, microphones stands and African drums were scattered across the stage of Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts Tuesday night. As the lights dimmed, Grammy-nominated film composer and USC Thornton School of Music alumnus Ludwig Göransson took his place in one of two chairs. 
Nothing about his appearance or demeanor indicated just how important of a year he just had. After spending years composing for shows and movies such as “Community,” “New Girl” and “Fruitvale Station,” he finally has received worldwide recognition for his original score in the blockbuster success “Black Panther” and for his work on Childish Gambino’s (Donald Glover) Grammy-nominated album “Awaken my Love!”
Göransson said that he felt “enormous responsibility” when creating the score for “Black Panther.” To maintain authenticity, he embarked on a 16-hour flight followed by a 20-hour drive to a small village in Senegal to learn about local musical traditions firsthand, especially the drumming. He said it was there that he recorded many of the drums and vocal samples that would make their way into the film.
Göransson said the hardest part of creating the film score came later. 
“Western music is focused on harmonies, whereas African music has a much heavier focus on rhythm,” he said. 
Blending the modern hip-hop and other cinematic sounds while ensuring West African music was front and center proved to be an exciting challenge forthe composer. 
“I’m so happy people all over can hear music they otherwise wouldn’t,”  Göransson said.
The rest of the evening was broken up by a series of live performances showcasing drum patterns and voices featured in the film. The music — drumming in particular — was sharp, commanding and entrancing. As each performer took the stage, Göransson would shift to the side of the stage, smiling and nodding his head, completely captivated. 
He talked in detail about the different types of drums and the meaning of each rhythm he used in the film. Furthermore, Göransson discussed his use of themes and motifs when composing the music. He said the West African drumming pattern for royalty follows the protagonist T’Challa from the very first time that he appears on the screen to the very end of the film. 
“It’s a theme he has to grow into,” Göransson said. 
Göransson admits much of his music is melancholic. He places the blame, at least in part, on growing up in Sweden.
“It’s cold and dark all the time. There isn’t much to do but sit inside and make music,” he remarked.
Just as important as his musical prowess is Göransson’s knack for finding and cultivating lasting friendships and partnerships. Since meeting Ryan Coogler at USC, he has gone on to compose for all four of his films.
Donald Glover, whom he met on the set of “Community,” is another longtime friend and collaborator.  Göransson reminisced about the first time they met, which was also the first time he expirienced an earthquake.  
“I went over to [Glover’s] loft and we were at the top of this skyscraper, which are designed to sway when there’s an earthquake,” Göransson said. 
Panicked once the earthquake began, both Göransson and Glover ran down 21 flights of stairs that night. 
“Maybe that’s what bonded us,” Göransson said. 
Since that day Göransson has worked on all of Gambino’s projects and is credited on every track of his latest album, “Awaken my Love!”
Almost as if it had been foreshadowed all along, Donald Glover walked out to a bright orchestral rendition of “Redbone,” sporting his now-iconic large beard, glasses and, similar to Göransson, a dark red velvet Adidas tracksuit. Glover took the microphone as Göransson moved to the side of the stage and grabbed his guitar. The orchestra continued, backed by a rhythm guitar and beautiful piano. Göransson looked giddily at the other instrumentalists as Glover delivered a live rendition of the song.
As the pair exited the stage, the audience jumped to their feet. Considering his multiple Grammy nominations, contributions to the highly anticipated Kanye release of “Yandhi” and many other exciting projects on the way, it seems that  standing ovations are something  Göransson will have to quickly grow accustomed to.

Unconscious bias in the hiring process is alive and well, a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found. The report showed that since 1990, white job applicants receive 36 percent more callbacks than black applicants and 24 percent more than Latinx applicants. The Marshall School of Business is hoping to change that — with the help of virtual reality.
As part of USC’s 2019 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion week, Marshall hosted an event Wednesday called “Exploring Unconscious Bias — A Virtual Reality Exercise.” Presented by Team Building | VR, a VR training and development program, the event detailed a new bias training program that Marshall hopes to pilot this summer in its Experiential Learning Center. 
Assistant Marshall Dean Gita Govahi said VR is essential in educating people about their unconscious biases because it makes the subject less “threatening.” 
“If I sit you down and say, ‘Let’s talk about your unconscious bias,’ it’s already in the conscious level, so it’s a waste of time,” Govahi said. “So I have to come up with a back door … it seemed natural to look at virtual reality as a way to explore unconscious bias.” 
The program that the company is currently developing with the center puts users in a scenario in which they are responsible for choosing the best candidate for a job. The exercise will begin with students reading and ranking five applications. Then, students put on the VR headset to complete a 20-minute hiring process, including video interviews with the candidates, who will be played by actors. 
Miles Suleman, chief operating officer of Team Building | VR, said one of the goals of the VR experience is to evoke emotion from users. 
“Having the emotional connection to why [unconscious bias] is wrong and having that near first-hand experience is a very good tool for driving behavior,” Suleman said. “What we wanted to do is create a narrative that created [emotional] investment for the student in the exercise.” 
After students select the candidate they believe is best for the job, two “higher-ups” take on the task of further evaluating the selected candidate. The student will observe the conversation, which will be tailored to include biased comments — for example, criticizing an applicant’s tattoos.
In every scenario, the candidate the student selects ultimately will not be picked for the job. In the final portion of the exercise, students sit in the selected candidate’s car while he or she is rejected over the phone. 
“The scenario is going to reject every single [candidate], just to show you someone else’s biases,” Govahi said.  
Suleman said the experience has been designed to invite open conversation without making students defensive about the implicit biases they may have. 
“When things like this happen to you, you don’t necessarily want to have a discussion about it,” Suleman said. “But when you are invested with someone and watch it happen, you have the ability to talk about why you think it’s wrong.” 
The presenters said retention levels can be as high as 80 percent one year after a VR experience. Rob McCarty, CEO of Team Building | VR, said the technology is ideal for education and training because it allows users to fail and try again without real-life repercussions. 
“Simulating an experience comes down to really hijacking all of the senses to really create a sense of presence in the brain,” McCarty said. “This sense of presence is where memories can be formed, experiences can be had and emotions can be provoked . . . We were going fully into the deep end.”
McCarty and Suleman spoke of other ways virtual reality is used in order to create social change. The United Nations’ Virtual Reality program, use immersive storytelling to encourage empathy and positive social change.
Govahi said the VR experience is not meant to test users for a right or wrong answer. 
“Bias is nothing more than recognition or relating to patterns that are familiar to you,” Govahi said. “Our job with this exercise is [to] put you in touch with the patterns that you are familiar with. Then you’re the judge of what aspect or component of your perception and future behavior you’re going to change.”

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit organization that campaigns for freedom of speech at colleges, denounced USC’s most recent change to its speech code in early January.
The new regulation, which was implemented last summer, required students to register their protest or demonstration two weeks in advance. FIRE noticed the change while updating their database of free speech policies from over 450 colleges and universities for 2019. 
“College should be a marketplace of ideas where students go to learn,” said Laura Beltz, a FIRE senior program officer for policy reform. “A big part of that is through expressive activities on campus -— it’s really important that students aren’t discouraged from expressing themselves.” 
Since FIRE released its statement, USC has planned to clarify the wording of the policy from “required” to “recommended.” 
The policy’s current wording does not differentiate between demonstrations, meaning smaller protests would also fall under the regulation. 
Beltz said the policy change may have affected free speech and student expression on campus.
“[Students would] be discouraged from getting out there and conducting that expressive activity in the first place,” Beltz said. 
The change in speech policy moved USC from the “yellow light rating” to the “red light rating” on the FIRE website, labeling USC with the harshest rating a university can receive for its speech regulations. Beltz said that USC’s policy change was a clear and substantial restriction of speech protected under the First Amendment. 
“The University gets to do reasonable time, place and manner restrictions … the question is, is a two-week registration a reasonable time, place and manner restriction?” said Michael Overing, an Annenberg adjunct professor who specializes in censorship and First Amendment issues. “It seems like the use of two weeks [would] be used to suppress speech.” 
For some students who have coordinated and participated in demonstrations and protests, the regulation feels overly restrictive. 
“It stops students from having quick response times,” said Mac Whitaker, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering. “USC these days is full of scandal, and any time something happens, you have to register two weeks in advance — that’s gonna really kill anyone’s interest in it.” 
Whitaker participated in the protest that emerged in response to conservative commentator Ben Shapiro ‘s visit to campus last October.
“[It] really makes what we’re saying worthless if we can’t respond immediately,” Whitaker said. 
In response to the FIRE article, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said the two-week notice was intended to avoid potential conflicts from planning, such as adequate staffing, safety and booking of popular outdoor areas. 
“The University of Southern California strongly supports the free speech rights of our students,” Carry wrote in his response letter to FIRE. “And this extends to campus demonstrations.”
While the current policy requires students to register protests and demonstrations two weeks in advance, USC plans to change the policy’s wording to not require students provide advance notice of their protests.
“[We are going] to clarify the wording in the upcoming 2019-20 version of the policy,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Students will not be required to provide two-week notice of their intent to hold demonstrations.”
However, even without the requirement, the policy strongly encourages students to register their demonstrations beforehand. 
“As you know, USC’s Policy on Free Speech strongly states that ‘free inquiry and expression are encouraged and celebrated,’” the University said in a statement. “We do not intend to go back on our pledge to support our students’ rights to free expression.”

Cyntoia Brown, the subject of Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Professor Dan Birman’s documentary, was granted clemency on Jan. 7. The decision by Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam comes nearly eight years after the release of “Me Facing Life: Cyntoia’s Story.”
Brown, an alleged victim of child sex trafficking and prostitution, was arrested for murder in 2004 and sentenced to life in prison in 2006, after killing a man who she claimed paid her for sex. After hearing about her story, Birman, along with a team of students and other community members, began to work on a project documenting Brown’s life and the enslavement to a pimp referred to as “Kut Throat.”
Although she was only 16 during the incident, Brown was tried as an adult and sentenced to 60 years in prison. As of now, she has served 15 years. Following her release from prison in August, she will undergo 10 years of parole supervision.
The documentary ignited a national conversation and sparked a movement of people across the country who have called for her release, much to Birman’s surprise.
“For the first six years while I was working on the project, my fear was that we might not make a big impact, and we might not make noise, and that was a scary thought,” Birman said.
But movements like #FreeCyntoiaBrown exploded on social media, with celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and LeBron James voicing their support. Organizations such as Color of Change, The Sentencing Project and the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth joined efforts to support her appeal. 
“One of the pillars our organization believes in is youth justice,” said Clarise McCants, criminal justice campaign director for Color for Change. “Children need to be treated like children. No child should be sentenced to serve the rest of their life in prison. Everything she’s been put through is a miscarriage of justice.” 
During her time in prison, Brown obtained her GED and a degree from Lipscomb University and mentored troubled youth, according to reports by Vox and NPR. In his decision to release Brown from prison, Haslam cited Brown’s educational progress and outreach behind bars.
“Cyntoia Brown committed, by her own admission, a horrific crime at the age of 16,” Haslam said in a statement released by the governor’s office on Jan. 7. “Yet, imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life. Transformation should be accompanied by hope.”
Megan Chao, an adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, worked as an associate producer and researcher for the documentary. She said that when she heard that Brown had been granted clemency, it hit her on a personal level.
“It was just very emotional to think that someone would have a second chance at life that wasn’t even a possibility 15 years ago,” Chao said. “I think this is a historic time for Cyntoia [and] for juvenile justice in general.” 
Michael Renov, documentary expert and vice dean of academic affairs at the School of Cinematic Arts, said that Birman’s documentary is one of many to have influenced social movements.
“Documentary film, for a long time, had at least one important strand or trend within it — trying to draw public attention to some kind of injustice,” Renov said. 
He said he believes that documentaries have the ability to humanize large issues, like the Brown case, in a way other mediums may not be able. Renov also said good films can shape an audience’s perception and can potentially change lives.
“Art has the power to transform,” Renov said. “It can make the familiar entirely unfamiliar and, in making it strange, it can show us [something] in a very different way. It can change the way we perceive ourselves in the world.” 
Birman said that it was a “sobering thought” to see his film have such an impact.
“We caused people on platforms, young, old … to take a look at an issue with their own lens and talk about it,” Birman said. “It really gives me great hope that the form of documentary can really make a difference.” 
Brown’s story also received support from Black Lives Matter organizers, who cited systemic criminal justice discrimination of black and brown people in statements voicing their support. According to a 2018 report from The Sentencing Project, black girls are 3.5 times more likely to be placed in juvenile detention. 
Some criminal justice reform has occurred over the years. In 2007, 175,000 juveniles were tried as adults and, in 2014, that number dropped to just over 90,000, according to a 2017 report by the Campaign for Youth Justice. In 2018, Tennessee established the Juvenile Justice Reform Act aimed at increasing outreach to youth and reserving detention for those who committed serious crimes.
Chao and Birman are currently working on a sequel to the documentary entitled “Me Facing Life 2: Cyntoia’s Fight for Freedom.” The documentary will be a follow-up on Brown’s life,  covering recent events all the way up to her release this summer. 
“It is so important to pay attention to the thousands of Cyntoia Browns out there,” Birman said. “We just hope that the conversation that we started with the first documentary and that we will continue with the new documentary, will really help to illuminate new narratives in juvenile justice.” 
The second documentary is expected to be released this fall.
