Coming off a humbling week that included losses to No. 10 California and No. 2 Stanford, the USC women’s tennis team embarks on its first Pac-10 road trip this weekend, making stops at Oregon and Washington State.
Coming on strong · The play of freshman Kaitlyn Christian has been instrumental as of late despite losses to California and Stanford. - Murugappan Aroonachalam | Daily Trojan 
The past week’s competition proved too much for USC coach Richard Gallien’s squad, as evidenced by senior Maria Sanchez’s first loss in 24 games (to Cal’s Jana Juricova).
Though back-to-back losses to two top-10 teams isn’t always cause for concern, the defeats taste even more bitter because they came at the hands of in-conference rivals.
One of the bright spots for USC (11-5, 1-2) during its recent slump has been the development of freshman Kaitlyn Christian.
Although she only split her two games last week, Christian notched USC’s only singles win against the Golden Bears taking down No. 57 Annie Goransson in straight sets and taking No. 11 Nicole Gibbs of Stanford into a second-set tiebreaker before falling 6-3, 7-6 (6-3).
In doubles, she and Sanchez have risen from No. 80 to No. 5 in the most recent polls. Last week, the pair took down both Cal and Stanford’s top-three ranked doubles squads in succession.
For sophomore Danielle Lao, the upcoming road trip will give her time to regroup as she tries to regain her health. Lao hasn’t been in good form since she started to have elbow trouble.
“This is a great opportunity to get a couple of tough wins and see if we can regain a little momentum before we head to the desert next weekend,” Gallien said. “I am really optimistic that we will play well.”
As Oregon (7-9, 1-4) and Washington State (10-8, 0-5) feature just one ranked potential matchup among them (Oregon’s No. 116 Pavlina Smatova), USC hopes it will be able to bounce back and return to its winning ways.
Good luck ladies

Fueled by the leadership of veteran captains junior Steve Johnson, senior Jaak Poldma and a bevy of maturing young talent, the USC men’s tennis team looks to continue its strong play in Pac-10 competition, following recent drubbings of Stanford and California, by hosting Oregon and Washington on Friday and Saturday at Mark’s Stadium.
A week after its Bay Area roadtrip, No. 2 USC (16-2, 2-0) finds itself a spot higher in the national rankings.
“The season’s getting better,” Johnson said. “Guys are getting healthier and healthier. Ray [Sarmiento’s] been back in the lineup consistently and is playing very well for us. The team’s getting closer, stronger and coming together.”
Sarmiento was named Pac-10 Player of the Week, after Poldma received the honor last week for the second time this season.
Johnson, still ranked No. 1 nationally, credits his younger teammates and the steady play of his co-captain for the team’s success.
“Both [Stanford and Cal] are very good programs, and we were fortunate enough to just go out there and play very well in singles, with the freshman especially and Jaak,” Johnson said.
But the wins haven’t come from the new blood alone. Johnson and Poldma, who have played at No. 2 and No. 3 this season, are both undefeated in their singles matches.
USC coach Peter Smith couldn’t be more proud of Poldma, who is set to graduate in May.
“Jaak’s always been an incredible example off the court, but he wants to make a statement graduating,” Smith said. “He’s a great, incredible leader, and he’s just doing it on the court in singles and doubles.”
Strong leadership, it seems, might be the key to the Trojans’ success.
“To have your number one and two players undefeated? I haven’t been able to say that ever,” Smith said. “The last two weeks have been the proudest for me in the last years.”
Smith attributes the success to the diligence and hard work of the entire team, from top to bottom, and as the Trojans prepare to battle the Ducks and the Huskies, they only have one goal in sight. 
“They’re both good teams, and we never want to look past anyone,” Johnson said. “We want to compete hard both days and come out of the weekend 4-0 in Pac-10 play.”
Oregon does not have any ranked players on its roster, and in last season’s matchup, the Trojans walked away with a 7-0 victory over the Ducks.
USC edged out Washington 4-3 last spring.
Staying focused, Smith says, is key to prospects of continued success and will be the real test of the weekend.
“We’ve got to stay humble and we have to stay hungry,” he said.

USC baseball has been a team defined by streaks. The Trojans started off the year 3-9, then appeared to turn it around, winning five of six. Now, however, the Trojans are back on a slide, and doing whatever they can to change things up, including practice at 5 a.m. Wednesday.
Slump· In USC’s recent slide, the Trojans have hit just .242. Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa, however, had five RBIs Sunday against UCLA. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
“It wasn’t about making them get up early and run,” coach Frank Cruz said. “It wasn’t about punishment. It was just about changing things up at practice.”
Added Cruz, “They needed a little kick, a little extra [motivation].”
The Trojans will need their kick in Berkeley, Calif. today when they face off against No. 13 California, the fifth team the Trojans (9-16, 1-2) have faced this year that was either ranked when they played or is ranked currently. That’s 11 games against top-25 teams, with three more coming up this weekend against the Golden Bears (17-5).
It’s a bad time for the Trojans to be struggling, as they enter the thick of Pac-10 play.
“We might be pushing a bit,” conceded sophomore outfielder J.R. Aguirre.
USC comes into this weekend series having lost five of six and has been shut out in two of its last three games. In the Trojans’ last six games, the Trojans are hitting .242 and have scored just 23 runs, less than four-per-game. Take away a nine run outburst against Louisville, and that’s 2.8 runs-per-game.
Add that to Cal’s pitching, which hasn’t allowed an earned run in six of its last seven games and posted a 0.42 ERA over that stretch, and it doesn’t look good for the Trojans.
The Bears have a lot to play for. The Cal Athletic Department announced in September plans to cut the baseball program, among others, as a cost-cutting measure. Although there is a large-scale fundraising movement to save the program in progress, there is a chance this is the final year of Cal baseball, and it seems the team is determined to make it a memorable one.
The Bears started out the season ranked No. 17, and after a 6-4 start have won 11 of their last 12. Three of their losses have come at the hands of No. 3 Oklahoma, No. 8 Stanford and No. 22 Connecticut by a combined total of five runs. They beat a No. 18 Rice team that swept the Trojans earlier in the year, and currently sit atop the Pac-10 after sweeping Washington State last weekend.
And being on top of the Pac-10 is no easy feat.
“This is just about as strong as I’ve ever seen the conference, top to bottom,” Cruz said. “There are no weekends off.”
Eight Pac-10 teams have been ranked at some point this year. Six are currently ranked, with No. 5 Arizona State leading the pack. Stanford, Cal, Arizona, Oregon State and UCLA also sit in the top-25, and Oregon and Washington have each been ranked at some point as well.
The Trojans will face all those teams this year. Up next, it’s the Bears.
Just another weekend in the Pac-10.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has finally landed a job.
The former Governor of California will star as a cartoon superhero, known as The Governator.
Stan Lee, the creator of fictional characters such as Spider-Man, X-Men and Iron Man, will help co-develop the animated television show and comic book. The television show about the semi-fictional character will be ready sometime next year.
“The Governator is going to be a great superhero, but he’ll also be Arnold Schwarzenegger. We’re using all the personal elements of Arnold’s life… only after he leaves the governor’s office, Arnold decides to become a crime fighter and builds a secret high-tech crime-fighting center under his house in Brentwood” said Stan Lee to Entertainment Weekly.
 The decision is somewhat of a surprise, as many of fans wondered what Schwarzenegger’s next move now that he was out of office.
There were numerous discussions over the possibility of a sequel to True Lies, and while that may still come to fruition, the superstar has chosen animation as his next official project.
“When I ran for governor back in 2003 and I started hearing people talking about ‘the Governator,’ I thought the word was so cool. The word Governator combined two worlds: the world of politics and the movie world” said Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first press interview since he left office in January.

The campus was abuzz. A hoard of agents, reporters, photographers, NFL scouts and coaches formed a ring around the field. Friends and family gathered in the stands. Hundreds of students, teachers and passersby stopped to watch.
Former USC football players showcased their skills to NFL personnel Wednesday, hoping to increase their chances of getting drafted later this month.
That’s right. On one of the hottest days of the semester, the hottest place to be was Cromwell Field, watching players many people will only ever see on TV. Rarely is the entire USC community pulled together by one gravitational event on campus, but Wednesday’s Pro Day happened to be one of those days.
It was a sight fill any Trojan with a sense of pride, and also served to challenge those who had written off USC. Football is alive and well in Southern California, and Pro Day is still a big deal around here.
Only a few schools in the country can annually attract large crowd for Pro Day, and USC is still one of those schools. Yes, there were probably a dozen schools this year with a larger turnouts during their Pro Days, but often it was to see an exception, one player with extremely huge potential.
USC does have a player who many scouts were focusing on in offensive tackle Tyron Smith. Smith was the reason Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett came out Wednesday, and he didn’t disappoint.
But Smith is an offensive lineman, which isn’t one of those sexy, glamorous positions that make people like Paris Hilton, Gisele Bundchen and Kendra Wilkinson flock to the sport. Smith isn’t the reason everyone who walked by Cromwell stopped and watched for minutes or hours. Just the mere thought of USC Pro Day was enough for hundreds of people to check it out.
It also was enough for superagent Drew Rosenhaus. There are few agents in the world whose name carries more weight than Rosenhaus. Rosenhaus is the Swackhammer of football. Much like the Monstars boss represented every player on Moron Mountain, Rosenhaus monopolizes the best NFL players on this planet. So if Rosenhaus shows up somewhere, you know it’s a big deal.
But attendance wasn’t just limited to a few notable faces. Thirty-one of the 32 NFL teams were represented at Pro Day, which is a sign the program is healthy. Among them were three general managers, Oakland Raiders coach Hue Jackson and Minnesota Vikings linebackers coach Mike Singletary.
The fact that all these people came to USC shows the Trojans still have a lot of options to offer teams.
In addition to Smith was fellow offensive lineman Kristofer O’Dowd, wide receiver Ronald Johnson, tight ends Jordan Cameron and David Ausberry, running backs C.J. Gable and Allen Bradford, defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, linebacker Malcolm Smith and quarterback Mitch Mustain. That’s more variety than you’ll find in the periodic table. Heck, you might be able to fill a team to compete with Brett Favre and the Wranglers in a swampy field in Mississippi.
So even though there wasn’t a star working out on Cromwell Wednesday such as Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart, Taylor Mays or Rey Malauga, that didn’t stop Pro Day from being the spectacle that it always is at USC.
And I think that’s one spectacle athletic director Pat Haden wouldn’t mind keeping around.

Lost among a laundry list of other wide-open position battles is freshman kicker Andre Heidari, the favorite to succeed departing senior Joe Houston at the start of next season.
It is no secret USC coach Lane Kiffin lost his confidence in the kicking game toward the end of last season, hesitant to attempt even 35-yard field goals.
Searching · USC coach Lane Kiffin and special teams coach John Baxter hoping Andre Heidari can take over kicking duties. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Heidari, rated the best kicker in the 2011 high school recruiting class by ESPN, has exhibited a strong, yet sometimes inconsistent, leg, so far in spring practices.
In some practices he has made all his attempted field goals, while in others he has hit less than 50 percent.
If Heidari develops as expected, Kiffin will have more flexibility in his offense next season.
Before Heidari trots out for his first field goal at the Coliseum, however, he must first adjust to a new school.
“Getting used to the school has been my biggest adjustment, but it’s been fun here,” Heidari said. “Just getting to know everybody, getting around campus has been fun. I was nervous about going to classes the first day, but a lot of guys on the team helped show me around.”
When asked what he projects as his in-season range, Heidari said he feels confident kicking from within 50 yards. USC’s offense, especially late in games, would appreciate such production.

Frustrated by a patchwork offensive line’s protection for the first four spring practices, Matt Barkley was noticeably more upbeat about yesterday’s pass protection.
“[The offensive line has] definitely gotten better,” Barkley said. “You can see that I had more protection. I knew that coming in — new line, young guys. They just need experience. It’s a challenge for me as well to get them on the same page.”

The USC men’s volleyball team will embark on a four-match road trip that begins this weekend against No. 3 Stanford and No. 14 Pacific.
The No. 1 Trojans (16-1, 15-1) have been firing on all cylinders, winning 10 matches in a row heading into the final stretch of the season.
USC leads the conference in total offense and defense. The Trojans’ offense is remarkably efficient, with a league-best .358 season hitting average. The Trojans hold their opponents to a league-low .244 hitting average. USC also ranks first in kills per set and digs per set.
Daily Trojan
And this weekend, the Trojans might be better than ever.
“We’ve really been getting better offensively over the past week,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “The improvements might not translate into our hitting numbers immediately, but they will in the long run.”
Although significantly less dominant, Stanford (16-6, 12-5) is the defending national champion and is second place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
“Me, Tri [Bourne], Maddison [McKibbin] and Henry [Cassiday] have known and played with a lot of the Stanford guys growing up in Hawaii, so there’s a huge rivalry here,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “And Stanford is the most hostile environment I’ve played in. It’s going to be a fun and exciting match.”
The Trojans swept Stanford last month at the Galen Center. Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli finished with 12 kills earned at a .667 clip with five aces.
“I was at a super high level of focus,” Ciarelli said. “I can’t expect to go out and hit and serve those numbers again, but I’m going to keep doing what I do regularly and help out the best I can.”
Stanford has won seven of its last nine matches since playing USC, and lost a closely contested five-set match to Long Beach State last weekend.
“We were really locked in [the last Stanford] match because we came in with a heightened level of focus, especially because we lost to Pepperdine in a tough five-set match the week before,” Ferguson said. “Stanford will be hungry.”
On the other hand, Pacific (10-15, 4-13) has struggled lately, compiling a 4-6 record since the February match against USC, including sweeps at the hands of UCLA, UC Irvine and Hawai’i.
Although its record is less than prestigious, Pacific ranks first in the MPSF in blocks, averaging 2.94 per set.
“They’ll serve very tough too,” Ferguson said. “Teams tend to serve much better at home, and they seem like they’re ready to turn it up a notch.”
If the Trojans win these two matches, they will clinch the top seed in the upcoming MPSF tournament.
“It would be something special,” Ferguson said. “The MPSF is the toughest league in college athletics. But we have to focus on Stanford and then Pacific, or else this speculation won’t mean anything.”

Three weeks ago, the USC women’s basketball team watched its NCAA tournament hopes evaporate in the midst of  an Arizona barrage of three-pointers.
The loss relegated the Women of Troy (24-12) to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament, a disappointing end to a season that started with so much promise.
In the zone · Junior guard Ashley Corral has played a pivotal role in the Women of Troy’s postseason run, averaging 18.2 points and shooting 73 percent from three-point range. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
But five games later, a resurgent USC squad stands poised to capture the program’s first WNIT title. All that stands in its way is a trip to Toledo.
Stifling defense has been USC’s calling card during its tournament run. The Women of Troy have held three of their five opponents to less than 35 percent shooting. In its last two games, USC has broken open close games by holding its opponents scoreless for long stretches.
That kind of defensive effort will need to continue against Toledo (28-8), which boasts a pair of talented scorers in guard Naama Shafir and forward Melissa Goodall. Both players have averaged more than 13 points per game for the Rockets, who enter the championship game averaging more than 66 points per game.
USC has held opponents to 56 points per outing so far in the WNIT tournament.
As strong as USC has been on defense, its offense has been just as potent. For the tournament, the Women of Troy are shooting 45 percent from the field and a blistering 48 percent from three-point range.
Junior guard Ashley Corral leads the team in tournament scoring with 18.2 points per game, despite coming off the bench. Corral is shooting nearly 75 percent from behind the arc and needs four three-pointers against Toledo to set a tournament record.
Tipoff is scheduled for noon Saturday in Toledo.
toledo area has this game being at 3 pm

Travie McCoy has gotten a lot of buzz for his solo career, and Wednesday night, McCoy’s energy and humor proved the Gym Class Heroes member knows how to please a crowd.
Smiley face · The amusing facial expressions and personal narratives from Travie McCoy highlighted his talent at the El Rey Theatre show. Opening acts included Pete Wentz, who first discovered Gym Class Heroes. - Photo courtesy of Fueled by Ramen  
After a long opening act featuring four radical artists — XV, Donnis, Bad Rabbits and Black Cards — Travie McCoy finally took the stage of the El Rey Theatre.
As soon as each member of the band stepped out and took their places McCoy started with a bang as his microphone stand lit up and he performed his upbeat “Akidagain.”
McCoy has had help on the tour, which he is using to promote his album Lazarus, from fellow musicians, including Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who also performed that night.
In fact, the most fun part of the opening performance was watching the drunk and untalented Pete Wentz bop to the wrong beat and play his incredibly simple and unfitting bass lines.
It was a great homage for Wentz to open for McCoy, as Wentz himself, under the label Decaydance, was the one who originally discovered and signed Gym Class Heroes.
McCoy riled up the audience, calling everyone to their feet, to “shake what [they] got.” He then shared an anecdote with the audience, one that fit the lyrics of the song.
“I’m always sick,” he said as he started his tale and at the end he stating, “That’s why I need a doctor to feel better.”
When audience members caught the key words, they broke out into applause and cheer for, in this case, “Dr. Feel Good.”
“Anyone been in a bad relationship?” McCoy asked. “The worst thing you could do to a guy is break up with them over phone or email,…” he shared before launching into “We’ll Be Alright.”
He rapped each line flawlessly and sang each chorus with excitement and personality.
His charismatic words and excitement, without fail, brought everyone to their feet, dancing along. McCoy stressed the live show makes him and his audience feel like family.
He was extremely personable and made sure everyone in the audience not only  felt included but also was having a great time.
During his performance of “Billionaire,” McCoy stated how loud it was on stage and asked the audience to sing the chorus for him as the band quietly provided backup.
The audience sang the chorus as McCoy comically illustrated the meanings of the lyrics with amusing facial expressions.
As the night progressed, the audience only got louder. As McCoy headed off stage after performing his popular “Need You,” the audience immediately began screaming for an encore.
Soon after, McCoy’s drummer appeared and banged out solos over clips of the DJ Khaled’s popular “All I Do Is Win” and Lil Wayne’s “6 Foot 7 Foot.” McCoy then stepped out with the rest of his band and performed “After Midnight.”
The night closed with McCoy announcing that Gym Class Heroes is not breaking up and that the band’s new album will be released within the year.
He then began his final song,  “Cupid’s Chokehold,” the song that put both Gym Class Heroes and Travie McCoy on the map in the music world.
All in all, McCoy’s charisma and enthusiasm captivated the audience throughout, and even those who might not like his music probably still  got a kick out of McCoy’s humor and personable performance.

It’s that time of the year again.
In the next month, the San Diego Comic-Con International website will be filled with requests for press passes, following months of mad dashes for hotel rooms and deals on San Diego accomodations. It’s the annual geek scramble.
But this year, as before, critics are upset that Comic-Con is not about comic books anymore. Some fans argue the convention has lost its focus, emphasizing television and videogames over the medium that gives the event its name.
In some ways, it’s true. It’s hard to walk through the aisles at the convention and not hear about some movie panel or see some actor or musician sitting down to talk about entering the comic industry.
But are these media so distinct from the comics industry?
Not really.
Sure, some things have no real reason to be at the convention (crime procedurals like White Collar or Burn Notice come to mind), but what about all of the projects based off comics? If Disney is making a film based on The Avengers, why not show it at Comic-Con? It is, after all, based on a comic.
Franchises and licensed properties have become a staple of stories for Hollywood, television and videogames. The big studios are turning to comics for ideas, and now comics appear in a wide array of media, with genres from superhero to crime to horror.
It’s not as if Comic-Con is the first event of its kind to go through this kind of influx from different fields. Sundance screens some mainstream movies, albeit ones with a decidedly “indie” twist. SXSW started out as a music festival, but is now known more for its technological aspects.
It’s not as if those original focuses have gone away. Yes, someone might go to Sundance solely to mingle with actors and watch an established director’s latest film, and someone might go to Comic-Con just to wait four days for one panel in Hall H, the part of the convention center with the biggest panels. Yet, the people who come for the movies will still see the comics.
And look at the bright side: More people are coming to Comic-Con. Every year the convention has been selling out four-day passes; this year, they sold out in February.
So although mainstream media are invading Comic-Con, more people are exposed to comics and the industry is reaching a wider audience.
What started as a small convention with about 300 attendees in a very niche industry has grown to hold more than 120,000 attendees and has become one of the biggest entertainment events in the world. Comic book writers and artists are treated like rock stars at panels, and word of mouth on the latest projects spreads like wildfire.
Comics are still going strong, and no matter how much hype the bigger projects might bring, it’s the comic industry that really gets the biggest gains out of Comic-Con.
Yes, the crowds will be there this year, the lines for Hall H will be ludicrous and there will surely be fans screaming about the latest movie trailer, video game footage or celebrity sighting.
But the comics aren’t going away. The event won’t suddenly become the A-list celebrity Gossip-Con.
Instead, Comic-Con is evolving, and if fans want to make sure the comic book aspect of it stays, they should go and support comic book creators there.
Why grumble about what should be a fun experience?
For geeks, nothing else compares to four days in this nerd paradise.

Peter Bjorn and John is the “Swedish band that got everybody whistling again,” according to AOL.
Peter Moré, Björn Yttling and John Eriksson have returned to the music world with their latest, cheery album, Gimme Some.
The album features happy vibes with an upbeat, light and airy feel though it also speaks to deeper emotional themes.

The band members’ light-hearted attitude comes across in their biography, posted on the band’s website,  which states, “despite numerous visits to psychics, prophets, wizards and fishmongers, not one person guessed that they would be the authors and performers of the third- most successful song (featuring whistling) of all time.”
Evidently, this trifecta has a splendid sense of humor that it wonderfully captures, in Gimme Some.
Their unique sound is apparent in tracks like  “Tomorrow Has to Wait,” which has a rhythmic drum beat that makes you want to clap along, as well as with the energetic “Lies.”
The song also serves as an emotional confrontation to a deceptive lover.
Front man and lead vocalist Morén repeatedly states, “I don’t think you are sorry for what you did,” as though he has realized the relationship has failed and is calling out his ex-lover for her romantic betrayals.
This simple yet honest outpouring of emotion gives the listener something to connect to.
The complete honesty opens the door for listeners to relate to the artists and cope with their own problems.
If art is a reflection of life, then Peter Bjorn and John are masters at showing the more painful moments in life, but also the ability to overcome these moments, providing fans with the opportunity to overcome their common struggles together.
“Dig a Little Deeper,” for instance, delves into romantic woos as it aims to discover the catalysts for the failure of a relationship.
The same attempt at both self-discovery and working though relationships is seen in “Breaker Breaker,” which repeats the line before you break my heart, foreshadowing a failed relationship.
Peter Bjorn and John goes beyond the simple relationship problems that are commonly heard on today’s modern radio.
“Gimme Some” provides much needed relief by delving into other types of pain, exploring personal suffering not induced by a romantic counterpart, but instead by problems engendered by oneself.
“Down Like Me,” for example, expresses a defeatist attitude. Morén professes in a seemingly emotionless state, no one brings me down like me, in a monotone narrative that emphasizes a state of nothingness.
Maybe the album artwork serves as an indicator of the enthusiasm and cheerful feelings of the album.
With its three thumbs up, á la Siskel and Ebert, and its colorful design, it radiates positive energy from the very beginning.
In any case, Gimme Some serves as the perfect balance between fun and heartfelt.
For fans of the British rock sensation We Are Scientists, this might be your softer, more indie outlet.
For Ra Ra Riot and The Smiths lovers looking for a similar upbeat enthusiasm, this is the perfect Swedish alternative to check out.
Peter Bjorn and John proves  incredibly refreshing with its unique, retro feeling, which is a welcome respite from the age of Ke$ha and Justin Bieber.
Gimme Some has earned its title as a charismatic, energetic and worthy listen.

Amid all the images, YouTube videos and written reports of the Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear failures, we can’t help but be in awe of the terror of it all.
Depending on one’s perspective, it can even raise questions of faith.
Maybe you prayed to God, maybe you cursed him. Maybe you thought if He’d existed the earthquake wouldn’t have happened at all.
There’s something in such a catastrophe that inevitably makes anyone, even the staunchest of atheists, at least ponder the subject of religion.
It makes complete sense. What else can people look to?
When 11,000 people are killed, 17,000 reported missing, more than 125,000 buildings wrecked at the hands of natural disasters — when we are faced with unimaginable violence and we don’t have a Gaddafi or a Hussein to blame — there’s really nowhere to look but up.
Such a conversation about religion could be a healthy, informative one. Unfortunately, a few radicals have dominated the national discourse, using recent crises as an excuse to degrade others and their beliefs instead of lifting each other up during dark times.
In the process, the very word “religion” has become corrupted by a minority.
“I’m not saying God is, you know, causing earthquakes,” Glenn Beck said on The Glenn Beck Program on March 15, adding, “I’m not not saying that either.”
Perhaps these claims are to be expected from Beck. He seems to be simply following the conservative pundits’ playbook, after Jerry Falwell blamed Sept. 11 on “alternative lifestyle[s]” in America, and Pat Robertson blamed last year’s earthquake in Haiti on the Haitian people’s “pact with the Devil.”
Likewise, Tokyo Gov. Shintar Ishihara (although he later attempted to redact his comments) told the Japan Times on March 14 the country “need[s] to use tsunami to wipe out egoism,” stating he believes the destruction is an example of “tembatsu,” Japanese for “divine retribution.”
According to these people, and others, God was punishing Japan.
It’s precisely because of the Becks, the Ishiharas and Falwells of today that religion, as a notion, needs to be redefined by better-meaning people.
If anyone saw Rainn Wilson’s SoulPancake presentation in Bovard Auditorium last Friday, I suppose I’m advocating one of the same things he did: the re-evaluation of the word “religion.” It’s been corrupted by those who don’t practice it but  instead wield spirituality as a political tool.
The City of Los Angeles is rather unfortunately positioned along the southern stretch of the San Andreas Fault. Based on empirical geologic research, enormous earthquakes have hit the area approximately every 150 years. The last was a 7.9 — in 1857.
So do we blame others for this imminent crisis? Do we run in fear? We can. Or we can use faith, whatever that might mean to us, to unite in common purpose.
In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, religion is posited as a choice: A choice between believing there is only the truth we know on Earth and believing that there is a greater — perhaps happier — truth to be found in religion. Neither is provable, but Martel personally advocates picking “the better story” because it gives us a purpose. And many of us out here seem to want one of those.
After all, the very word religion, when broken down into its components, means “reconnect.” Perhaps, as students, we can connect the word, and notion, back to its roots.
Greg Irwin is a freshman majoring in international relations. 
You need to rephrase your article. “inevitably makes anyone, even the staunchest of atheists….”
I’m agnostic/non-religious, and the thought of faith never once came to mind. I’d rather think about the welfare of a country that was devastated by a natural cause (emphasis on natural, there’s no one to blame, so why blame anyone?), and worry about how to help, than think about my personal religion and why God would do this (though I don’t even believe in him.)
I understand you are a freshmen, but this article needs some work. Who are you to say what religion should be? And using Rainn Wilson as the center of your article shows how little you have thought about the topic. Religious Conservatives bad, liberal thinkers good is not really an argument.

For USC students, there might be no more important battle being waged than the one in the California legislature over this year’s state budget.
This week, negotiations broke down after Republicans presented Gov. Jerry Brown with a list of 53 new demands they say must be addressed before they will vote on whether to allow a referendum on tax increases in July.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
What was originally projected to be a $26 billion budget deficit now stands at $15 billion after a combination of budget cuts, loans and transfers. Brown’s office says the remainder of the gap must be closed with tax increases to avoid deep cuts to education, public safety and other critical services.
With an exceedingly uncooperative opposition, however, it has been difficult for Brown to get anything done.
Republicans have prevented the democratically controlled government from making progress on the budget throughout the year. They voted down proposals to cut welfare grants and end local redevelopment agencies — both longstanding conservative goals that would have helped narrow the budget gap — apparently for no other reason than they were supported by Democrats.
Now, three months after the budget process had started, the Republicans’ 53 demands demonstrate more forcefully than ever the incompetence of Republicans in California’s government. Reportedly, Republicans are insisting Democrats restore $32 million in state subsidies for county fairs, change the date of California’s presidential primary and agree not to pursue any changes to the state’s tort laws or civil service code.
Brown wants a referendum in July to allow Californians to vote on a package of tax increases — 0.25 percent on personal income taxes, 1 percent on sales taxes, 0.5 percent on auto registrations — which, along with a $210 decrease in the child tax credit, would be projected to close the deficit. The referendum is key, as Brown promised during his campaign he would not raise taxes without voters’ approval.
Republicans are now holding up that referendum with their list of silly demands. The absurdity and irrelevance of these demands has led the top Senate Democrat, Darrell Steinberg, to tell reporters, “It’s time for this to end. I am ready to pull the plug.”
An end to negotiations between the two parties can’t lead to anything good for Californians. Brown could try to launch the referendum without Republican support, but it could be declared unconstitutional by the courts. Either dramatic cuts to crucial state services or a partial shutdown of the government when it runs out of cash in the summer would be more likely.
Either of these scenarios would likely lead to lay offs of teachers, shorter school years, more unpaid furloughs for state workers, cuts to police and correctional services and reductions in state support for the elderly, infirm and the poor.
Furthermore, allowing the government to run out of cash would lead to the further deterioration of California’s financial position. We already have the lowest credit rating of any state. Another summer of late payments might make it impossible for California to raise more money when it is needed in the future.
That California Republicans would risk, and even embrace, such an outcome in the name of partisan politics is shameful, and USC students should be up in arms about it.
It is true that, at a time of economic difficulty, it is often better to cut government spending than to raise taxes in order to close a deficit.
California, however, is at the point now where more spending cuts would affect not only the daily lives of our most vulnerable citizens — children, the poor, the sick and the elderly — but would also erode the human capital that is the state’s primary asset. Republican posturing risks creating a generation of under-educated Californians, which is the outcome we need to guard against most carefully.

I’ll bet these republicans were all members of kappa sig
I would say that eons of Democratic and teacher union control of the schools have already created scads of undereducated citizens, Daniel – that’s how we got Jerry Brown elected again.
I got an idea, lets raise taxes on LEGAL citiizens so that we can pay for the illegals getting our benefits.  Years of democrat control has led us to where we are.  Kick out the illegals and watch the budget deficit improve.  Tax the companies that hire illegals, drop the anchorbaby system, and make all legal documents in english.  ADIOS
Saying that you understand the need to cut spending but can’t support it due to it not giving money to the citizens is like saying you’re having a heart attack but will decline to call 911 to save yourself. Patently ridiculous – the ideas are one and the same.
You say that the “elderly” are some of the most vulnerable citizens? There are over 9,000 people in the California Public Employees Retirement System who are making pensions of more than $100,000 a year, including someone who gets over $500,000 a year pension. How much do you make? How much do you think you’ll make when you get out of USC? How much do you think you’ll make lounging around all day with your grandkids not doing ANYTHING productive?
http://www.californiapensionreform.com/database.asp?vttable=calpers
More importantly, how does paying people more than twice the national average for not working constitute supposed Democrat goals like “social justice”? Sounds more like “milk the taxpayer” to me.
Uhh, Daniel, the party that has had a stranglehold on California for eons and drove the economy 6 feet under is the Democrats and you opine that the Republicans are putting California at risk???  Dude, lay off the meth, take some econ classes and pay attention.  We can’t spend our way out of all our problems.
This just in… Republicans now DO want a vote… But a vote on reductions to pensions, NOT the budget. Seems like they’re wrangling to be heard any which way they can without rhyme or reason. Why is it that they insist the voters NOT get to vote on maintaining the current taxes that are set to expire, where as they insist on voters GETTING to vote on pension reform? Are they mad? I suppose so. I think they’re mad at the middle class and the poor. Last I figured that was about 90% of us. Who’s voting for these knuckle heads anyway?

Leaders of three faiths—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—met together yesterday to discuss the different ways Abraham is discussed in each of the religious traditions at USC Hillel.
The panel included Rabbi Reuven Firestone, professor of medieval Judaism at the Hebrew Union College and co-director of the USC Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement; Imam Jihad Turk, director of religious affairs at the Islamic Center of Southern California; and Reverend Jim Burklo, associate dean of religious life at USC.
The event, which started at 7 p.m., involved a reading of passages from the Torah, the Quran, and the Bible, all of which discussed Abraham. The panelists then introduced the different ways Abraham is represented in their respective religions. This was followed by a discussion, which involved attendees asking questions to the three panelists.
The event was moderated by Rabbi Lori Schneide, director of Jewish life at USC and was sponsored by the USC Interfaith Council, USC Hillel and the USC Muslim Student Union.

According to industry blog Deadline Hollywood, True Grit teen Hailee Steinfeld has been attached to a Sleeping Beauty script that has yet to find a studio. The blog reports that Lindsay Devlin penned the script from the princess’s point of view.
This project is just one of many fairy tales produced by Hollywood lately. This year’s Red Riding Hood came right after a lucrative Alice in Wonderland, and titles such as Maleficent, Snow White and the Hunstman, The Brothers Grimm, Hansel & Gretel and Oz: The Great and Powerful are just some of the fantastical tales moviegoers will experience in the next two years.
Hollywood must be convinced that these investments will get them the same response as Disney’s Alice in Wonderland, which earned $1 billion worldwide for the studio.
 
Red Riding Hood, distributed by Warner Bros. and released March 11, has grossed a tepid $32 million.

When taking a first glance at the preview of Katy Perry’s new video for her single “E.T.,” music fans could mistake her for Lady Gaga.
Her fans will see another side of the fun and flirty Perry. The video is vastly different from the other videos from her latest album Teenage Dream in that it takes a much more complex approach.
MTV released a short clip of the video, which gave an impression that the production turned out to be nothing like the sugary “California Girls” or simplistic “Teenage Dream.”
Taking on the theme of extraterrestrial, Perry floats around in outer space with makeup that makes her look like a creature from another planet and an illuminating outfit that could be found in a sci-fi video game or movie. Her headdress is very regal and comparable to something Gaga would wear to an award show.
In another part of the video, she lands on an unknown devastated planet, judging by its junk yard looks, in a long flowing neutral colored dress.
On that planet, she finds what first looks like an old robot, but then it turns out to be a man in some sort of suit.
To get a better idea of what the video is about, watch the new clip of Perry’s theatric video, which was posted today on MTV.com.

Undergraduate Student Government President Chris Cheng ends every meeting in his office the same way: he plucks magnetic darts off a dartboard calendar and offers his guest the first throw.
He’s just as gracious about winning as he is about losing, but he usually has pretty good aim.

It’s easy to see why Cheng succeeded at strengthening USG’s relationship with the university administration.
“Relationships and collaboration are beyond essential, because you can’t accomplish your goals without them,” Cheng said. “We’ve worked to make sure the people we’ve hired [in USG] communicate well, but also worked to maintain relationships with administrators, even if it’s just grabbing lunch.”
USG Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen takes a similar approach. Although he runs senate meetings efficiently, he almost always cracks a joke by way of greeting.
Cheng and Ogbevoen credit some of USG’s accomplishments to the unique opportunity to work with new university leadership, especially President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Elizabeth Garrett.
“Both the provost and the president have been more than engaging with us,” Cheng said. “They want a strong relationship with the students and that begins with us.”
Cheng said without Garrett’s enthusiasm and openness, his administration’s biggest accomplishment — extending Thanksgiving break — would not have been possible. Cheng and Ogbevoen said they thought it would have taken a full year’s worth of lobbying.
“[USG] has been trying to do this for decades,” Cheng said. “We have to thank the incoming provost for having such visionary thinking. This was a huge wall a lot of people didn’t think we’d get over.”
USG also worked with the provost to add two additional two-unit courses this semester: conversational Spanish and French.
Ogbevoen said he was proud of establishing a relationship between USG and ITS because Internet service affects every student on campus. He said the relationship was almost nonexistent in previous years.
ITS spent millions of dollars this year to improve the Wi-Fi network around campus, especially in classrooms.
“People have told me that the wireless seemed better and asked me if USG did it,” Ogbevoen said. “It’s really good to hear students notice the changes we try to make.”
USG also began hosting town hall meetings, a staple of the Cheng-Ogbevoen campaign platform, where students could talk directly to relevant administrators about issues on campus, such as the bike ban.
“A big part of our job is not only advocating for students, but staying connected with them,” Cheng said. “We do often this informally, talking to students in the campus center, but a more formal program was town hall meetings. We wanted to give students the chance to talk directly to administrators.”
President-elect Monish Tyagi and Vice President-elect Logan Lachman said they plan to continue several of the projects started by the Cheng-Ogbevoen administration, including working to improve campus sustainability, adding more two-unit classes, creating a fall break and facilitating communication between administrators and students.
“The administration speaks so highly of Chris,” Tyagi said. “He did such a great job building those relationships and that’s really going to help us out. It’s definitely some big shoes to fill.”
Cheng said he was happy with his administration’s achievements and has full confidence in Tyagi and Lachman.
“We’ve had so many accomplishments and we’re proud of them all,” Cheng said. “Now the train is moving.”

USC hopes participation in a new survey program will help the university improve the student experience.
The university is in its final stages of joining the Student Experience in the Research University Consortium, which will allow USC to partake in a multi-university survey USC officials hope will help them improve the university.
“We have been committed to improving the quality of undergraduate education for over 10 years now, and we have done a good job, but we are not satisfied,” said Mark Pavelchak, USC’s academic information officer.
Starting out as a survey for only University of California schools, the Student Experience in the Research University survey has now come to include 17 top universities, allowing USC to see where it stands in comparison to other research universities.  USC has been working three years to join the consortium.
Pavelchak said being part of the consortium will allow USC to evaluate how it compares to other schools.
“We have increased selectivity and student quality to where we can hold out against Berkeley and UCLA,” Pavelchak said.
The survey will provide detailed information on how students feel about specific academic programs and the overall USC experience.
The survey consists of a group of core questions and an individualized section chosen from random from a group of four topics.
“The survey asks you to look back from where you came from and why you came here,” Pavelchak said. “There are four modules students are randomly assigned to, which include academic experience and globalization, community and civic engagement, student life and development, and then lastly a set of special interest questions that pertain directly to USC.”
The survey is a comprehensive look at the university, and allows USC to look at what needs improvement
“The survey touches on every aspect of USC, from faculty to services to the climate of the campus,” Pavelchak said. “We are going to take an honest look at what students are patting us on the back for and at the constructive criticism and give that information to administration.”
The first wave of email surveys as sent out March 24. The university will continue to remind students who have yet to submit responses, as well as provide incentives for the completion of the survey in the form of cash prizes, an Apple iPad and an opportunity to participate in USC football’s Guest Coaches Program.
Although students are often bombarded with surveys for classes or other USC programs, the incentives for this survey and the chance to affect the university’s future seem to be catching the eye of students.
“Over my four years here, USC has changed so much,” said Betsi Crow, a senior majoring in biology. “Not only the area around USC, but I have definitely noticed that more programs are being offered and there are more events and clubs than there were when I was a freshman. I feel like USC has put an emphasis on continuing to improve, so this survey will provide them with a lot of good information to continue to do so.”
