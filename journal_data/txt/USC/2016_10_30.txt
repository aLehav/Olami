Crawling out of bed on a Monday morning to see dark, cotton candy looking clouds hover over Los Angeles is weird. If it begins to rain in LA, the first thought that crosses my mind is that the apocalypse is upon us. 
However in all honesty, I find my general reaction to rain odd. I should not be so surprised to experience rainy weather having grown up in Moscow, Russia, where I would usually wake up to a depressing sky. The days that vitamin D blessed our bodies (especially in the winter) were quite lucky.
Interestingly enough, now that I live in sunny California I can’t help but appreciate the rare gloomy weather, even if getting out of bed becomes a lot more challenging. 
Thus, I would like to share some of the fantastic benefits to cloudy days. 
Firstly, I feel like bad weather can trigger our memories and make us reminisce about important aspects of our life. For instance, during last week’s overcast Monday, I spared a few minutes from my busy day to just stare out the window. While lost in my own thought, I recalled a particularly fun afternoon that happened six years ago. My older sister and I decided to bravely dash outside into the rain during a raging thunderstorm while our parents weren’t home. Soaked to our underwear, we quickly sprinted back home to the safety of a warm shower. Although this memory might seem trivial to others, to me that afternoon was genuinely terrific. 
I believe that if LA was not cloudy that Monday morning, I would have not looked out the window. If I did not look out the window, I would have not thought about that specific memory.  As a college student, I think that these types of memories about family are really important to maintain. Memories help us stay in touch with our roots and also remind us to appreciate the people that helped shape us to be the person we are today. 
Cloudy days are also beneficial as a result of their magical ability to make people want to stay indoors. When it is sunny all the time, people feel the need to take advantage of the good weather, so they scatter to all corners of the campus. However, since bad weather encourages people to stay indoors, think about how easy it is to meet new people when they could be found all in one dorm building together or all huddled in the same library! 
Lastly, if you’re staying indoors anyways, maybe you’ll have more reason to go start writing that paper that’s due in a couple of hours… 
Therefore, although I appreciate the postcard perfect weather we Californians experience on a daily basis, I also enjoy a nice, cloudy day too.

Five USC students have created an app that aims to increase civic voter turnout, especially in the state of California.
Andrew Jiang, Michael Lim, Lucas Johnson, Alex Teboul and Arush Shankar won Spark SC’s Futurethon, a 48-hour hacking competition, with BallotView. The free and nonpartisan app allows voters to preview their state’s local ballot, learn details about each measure and candidate and save a receipt of their choices to take to the polls.
The students said that they came up with the idea because of the disorderly layout of ballots and the lack of media attention on ballot measures at the state and local level.
Lim, a senior majoring in economics and computational neuroscience, said that understanding these local measures is important because they affect citizens much more than national ones. In California, Lim said, the ballot initiative process allows citizens to propose new legislation without having to go through bureaucratic channels.
“If people aren’t aware of what is going to be voted on, then it just kind of opens the door for either poorly written legislation or allowing special interest groups to make their way onto the ballot,” Lim said. “We’re hoping that our product can help people sift through all the information in a much friendlier and quicker way, so that they don’t feel overwhelmed and [instead] feel empowered.”
According to Lim, the Nov. 8 election is a pilot run for the new application. State ballot previews are available for almost all 50 states, and the organization hopes to have detailed content on propositions and candidates for states aside from California in the upcoming years.
Over the past 10 weeks, the students have been given the opportunity to build their idea and work hand in hand with Global Shapers, an initiative to improve private partnerships around the world through a network of diverse individuals advocating for social change.
Shelby Kretz, a member of the Global Shapers Los Angeles Hub, said she hopes the app generates enough reach to prove whether or not it is impactful.
“We will work with Futurethon partners and the BallotView team after the election to determine if their solution helped increase down-ballot and millennial engagement,” Kretz said. “We will share our findings with the government in L.A., nonprofits, corporation partners and the overall community.”
Nate Kaplan, the founder of See Political, a nonprofit organization that creates animations explaining ballot propositions, and an advisor to the five creators of BallotView, said that the app is relevant because tackling low voter turnout among youth voters will require applying methods specifically tailored to millennials.
“Millennials vote less than any generation in American history, but they actually do more volunteer work and more community service than any generation in American history,” Kaplan said. “You know reading hundreds of pages of text just doesn’t make sense in 2016. So what we try to do is … parse down the issues so educating yourself isn’t so painful.”

Over 700 young men from around the Los Angeles area spent Saturday morning in Taper Hall, learning about how to achieve economic, social and political empowerment in their daily lives.
The Omega Educational Foundation hosted its 23rd Youth Leadership Conference and Mentorship Program this weekend, which featured a series of workshops and seminars aimed toward African American men ages 8 to 18. 
The goal of the free, one-day conference was to remind attendees that by concentrating on building one’s future, anyone can become a productive and valuable member of society. 
The conference was organized by 250 members of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, one of the oldest predominantly African American fraternities in the United States, and the first to be founded at a historically black college. The theme of this year’s conference was “Your Image,” and experts from different professional fields such as law enforcement, communications, education, technology and healthcare led workshops that taught attendees how to create a positive self-image.
Various workshops intended to stress the significance of being responsible for one’s own actions by encouraging men to attend college. Furthermore, seminars highlighted the importance of maintaining a good academic standing. 
Other workshops aimed to empower attendees by demonstrating the need to make sound decisions based on one’s freedom of choice, rather than uncontrollable circumstance. Additionally, seminars explained that by establishing healthy relationships with family and other community members, young men are set on the path of becoming leaders in society. 
One seminar held at the conference was “Manhood 101,” which emphasized the importance of respecting women and listening to one’s elders. 
“Seeing mature men in suits tells me that the guys leading the workshops have their stuff together, which automatically sends me a positive message,” said Tyler Johnson, a student at California State University, Los Angeles who attended the event.
Parents were also encouraged to attend, and a Mother’s Conference assembly enabled mothers to get in touch with adult men that could potentially mentor their sons. Fathers who attended the conference were coached on how to be good role models for their sons, and were given advice on how to best establish a healthy and communicative relationship. 
Ricky Lewis, the organizer of this year’s conference, advertised the event to public and charter schools as well as churches, community centers and YMCAs. Due to the large amount of people involved in arranging this event, Lewis said that the conference required almost a full year of preparation. 
“We are trying to encourage young men of color to just be good citizens, go to school, have better time management skills, proper hygiene and respect their community,” Lewis said.

Photo courtesy of Maya ElbazThe running dead · Lanny Ngo, the co-assistant director of the Special Events Committee, had her face painted by student volunteers to look like a zombie for Saturday’s event, which she helped organize.
Human “runners” shrieked as zombies staggered their way across McCarthy Quad Saturday night, growling menacingly. This was not an episode of The Walking Dead, but the 2016 Zombie Run, co-hosted over Halloween weekend by the USC Special Events Committee, the SC Triathlon team and USC Trojan Pride.
Approximately 200 people met and donned green glowstick bracelets and flag football belts. They were ready to run 2.5 kilometers, all while being chased by student volunteers dressed as zombies who were out for blood. 
Alice Mao, the assistant director of the Special Events Committee, said that the event included perks such as raffling off four tickets to Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights and providing free Clif Bars to attendees.
“This was one of the events that had a lot of success last year, so we decided to put it on again this year,” Mao said. “A huge part of the work was doing the marketing, so we had to make a lot of Facebook events, get promo items like cool stickers and free stuff.” 
Heather Lemaster, a senior majoring in biological sciences and global medicine, decided to take part in the event as a runner. Lemaster was excited at the prospect of a zombie run conveniently located right on campus. 
“I love running and I love Halloween, so this seemed like the perfect event,” Lemaster said. “I’ve done runs before, but I’ve never gotten the chance to do any of the national zombie runs, so this was a chance for me to participate in one.” 
Natalie Reyes, a senior majoring in law, history and culture and sociology, said before the event that she was excited to have the chance to reenact a scene straight out of one of her favorite TV shows. 
“I’m a big fan of The Walking Dead,” Reyes said. “I’m probably going to be scared out of my mind.” 
Jun Pyo Lee, a junior majoring in communication, participated as a runner last year and volunteered to be a zombie this year. Sporting a pale face and red mouth, Lee expressed gratitude for the makeup artists who took this opportunity to show off their skills. 
“The students taking makeup classes at USC volunteered to help us out, which was really nice of them,” Lee said. “I came here three hours before the event started and just sat, and they did it all for me.” 
Lanny Ngo, the co-assistant director of the Special Events Committee, was also made up as a zombie. She said she was happy to get students moving while bringing some Halloween spirit to USC. 
“It’s really fun to do something for Halloween, because we don’t really have another event for the holiday, so this is a way that we can incorporate a lot of the student body so they can have a good time,” Ngo said. “Also people who don’t usually run might get motivated to if they’re being chased.”

It began with Star Trek. An intimate group of students had gathered in the Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study in the corner of Doheny Memorial Library’s second floor for the opening round of discussion of Science Fiction Los Angeles, a conference dedicated to exploring the relationship between the genre of science fiction and the city of Los Angeles. 
The academy co-presented the event with the USC Dornsife College for Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West. As students began to file in, Academic Director of Programs Karin Huebner announced, “We need some sci-fi music,” pressing play on the intro to the Star Trek original series.
The first batch of attendees were all loosely affiliated with the Polymathic Academy. Many were students in the year-long course “Los Angeles: A Polymathic Inquiry,” co-taught by Huebner and professor William Deverell.
Others were members of a selective group of students who applied to be a part of this conference. They were selected not on the basis of their academic major’s relevance to the conference’s subject, but rather their willingness to engage in a polymathic (Greek for “interdisciplinary”) conversation about science fiction and Los Angeles.
Huebner started it off by sharing her introduction into the world of science fiction as a young girl, when her family made a weekly tradition of watching new Star Trek episodes as they came out. The student attendees nodded along as Huebner discussed how far ahead of its time Star Trek was: The 1960s original series staged the first interracial kiss on television and put female characters in prominent leadership positions.
As students spoke about their sci-fi obsessions, a consensus began to emerge — the value of science fiction is not that it can predict where society is headed, but rather that its fantastical elements let the audience reflect on contemporary social problems with some critical distance. 
Star Trek could move its progressive ideas past the Hollywood gatekeepers because it was set in the future. Perhaps it deserves some of the credit for changing the way people thought about social issues for the past 50 years.
The discussion shifted toward another divisive topic in the sci-fi community: scientific accuracy. The starting point was Interstellar, a film for which California Institute of Technology professor Kip Thorne was hired as a science consultant to vet the theoretical plausibility of each scene. 
But the conference’s second emphasis was never forgotten. Los Angeles’ importance to the sci-fi genre became clear as students listed their favorite sci-fi creators, such as Ridley Scott, whose film Blade Runner featured the city as an essential setting, as well as Angelenos Ray Bradbury and Robert Heinlein.
After pizza, students packed onto a USC bus headed for a screening of Her in the Linwood Dunn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood. Along the way, students shared what drew them to the conference.
“When I first came here, I had a really hard time understanding L.A.,” said Austin Rogers, a sophomore majoring in history. 
He mentioned Jack Parsons,  one of the founders of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, as an example of how he learned more about the city’s dynamic and creative culture. 
“There’s so many things going on that you can create your own world,” he said.
Gabriela Gomes, an MFA student in interactive media, shared an even more direct interest in the conference.
“I’m always asking the question, ‘What if?’” she said. “I’m interested in how sci-fi makes us reflect on the direction we’re going right now.” 
When asked about what she hoped to accomplish with Science Fiction Los Angeles, Huebner, who was sitting in the front of the bus, gestured to the talkative group of students behind her. 
“When I’m sitting here and I hear this amazing chatter — this is what the academy is about,” Huebner said. 
More important to her than addressing the conference’s title topic was developing a community of “braniacs” from different academic and personal backgrounds. 
She said that students often leave Polymathic Academy events with the ability to “think more efficiently” because through talking to one another, they learn to see the world differently.
The Her screening was introduced by Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne, who pointed out that despite the film’s gloomy portrayal of the technological future, it offered an optimistic and sophisticated prediction of the city’s future infrastructure.
“I always love the audience reactions when he pops up out of the subway and he’s at Venice Beach,” Hawthorne said. 
The conference continued Saturday with panel discussions on the history of science fiction produced in, for and about Los Angeles. Among the speakers were tech website Boing Boing’s Mark Frauenfelder and game designer Tracy Fullerton.
The event concluded with a video presentation about author Ray Bradbury’s life in Los Angeles, a conversation between writers Steve Erickson and Scott Timberg and closing remarks from professors William Deverell and David Ulin. 
With a successful turnout of over 160 students, Science Fiction Los Angeles sparked a major conversation about the role Los Angeles plays in producing famous sci-fi works in popular culture. 
“Most students at USC inhabit L.A. as a space,” said Remaya Campbell, a junior majoring in law, history and culture. “But, this class lets you experience L.A. as a narrative.”

Over the weekend, the USC Comedy Department hosted three nights filled with laughter, inspiration and joke telling. The festival featured a variety of renowned comedians and professionals in the film industry, highlighting their upcoming projects but also exploring the future of comedy in our ever-evolving society. 
Over the course of the weekend, each of these famed comedians set forth the following theme: Comedy serves as a catalyst for change, debunking cultural stereotypes and challenging the established canon of celebrated works. 
On Friday, attendees were met with two unforgettable events. The first was the student film festival hosted by Pauly Shore, a comedian known for his roles in Encino Man, Son in Law and The Curse of Inferno. Prior to the event, students in the School of Cinematic Arts had the opportunity to submit short comedic films under four minutes in length. 
Of the 55 submissions received, the Comedy Department selected the top 13 films, which were then shown to faculty members and other attendees. The students presented original, memorable films that captivated the audience members, portraying topics like white privilege, current fads and homophobia through creative storylines and skillful cinematic techniques. The students had the opportunity to showcase their filmmaking talent, but highlight how comedy can shed light on controversial issues in a profound way. 
Later that evening, USC alumni, students, faculty and guests anxiously awaited to hear from one of the University’s most notable alumni and celebrated comedian, Paul Feig. After graduating from the School of Cinematic Arts, Feig went on to have a widely successful career, directing films like Bridesmaids, The Heat and Spy. 
He also created the show Freaks and Geeks and has directed episodes of several acclaimed television series, including The Office, Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock. At the event, Feig captured the hearts of audience members with his charming wit, approachable manner and, of course, his contagious sense of humor. 
He offered insight into his writing and directing process, explaining how important improvisation and creativity are in his filmmaking process. Feig also encouraged students to not only pursue comedy, but also to create pieces that were thought-provoking, no matter how off-color or controversial they may be. 
The following two days of the festival contained awe-inspiring events as well. On Saturday morning, some of the leading women in comedy discussed their stories as comedians and how they have defied the stereotypes that frequently confined them in their careers. 
In addition, cast and crew members of HBO’s new comedy series Insecure discussed the elements of the show, which follows the life of an African American woman facing modern-day issues. 
The final day also showcased some famed speakers, including Judd Apatow, director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up and This is 40. Apatow examined the potential for success in the world of comedy and shared some knowledge that he gathered throughout his time in Hollywood. 
In a matter of three days, the Comedy Festival brought forth some of the most prominent comedians of the modern age, and also demonstrated the inherent value of comedy in our society. These artists underscored that comedians consistently use their humor to address destructive tropes, stereotypes and misconceptions that plague society.

Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanWonder women · Junior outside hitter Niki Withers had four blocks in the team’s victory against Colorado on Saturday. They lost to Utah on Friday.
The No. 24 women’s volleyball team split their matches against No. 21 Utah and Colorado over the weekend. The Utes (16-7, 7-5 Pac-12) beat the Women of Troy in four sets on Friday. On Saturday, the Women of Troy swept Colorado (12-10, 4-8 Pac-12). 
The Women of Troy (15-8, 7-5 Pac-12) were led by freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier with 31 kills, 20 digs and two aces. Sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford put up 19 kills and two aces. 
It looked like two different teams were playing on the weekend. The energy level varying between the matches was a big part of the difference.
“I saw energy, and that was good,” head coach Mick Haley said. “I thought we had more energy than our opponents.”
With only eight conference games left to play, USC will need to win out the season to vie for a spot at the top of the conference and good seeding for the NCAA tournament. At 7-4, USC is sitting at the middle of the conference, sharing the fifth spot with two other teams. 
“Tonight’s 3-0 win will help us for two weeks on the road,” Haley said. “The conference schedule is very difficult.”
Against Colorado, the Women of Troy recorded 41 kills to the Buffaloes 44 kills. 
“I worry a little bit about that,” Haley said. “But our production needs to be better.”
There are only three ways to manufacture points: kills, aces or blocks. A team can also get points by errors from the other team. While Haley was a touch concerned about the fact that the Women of Troy lost the attacking battle, they were +16 in aces, service errors, blocks and receiving errors. So, despite not recording more kills, they were able to top the other scoring categories and manufacture enough points for the win. 
“That’s hard for a team to overcome when we win all four of those battles,” Haley said. 
While USC played better than Colorado for the majority of the match and would build significant leads early, Colorado was able to find their way back into the matches and get as close as 25-23. Senior captain libero Taylor Whittingham said the team does a great job starting off matches, but has difficulty closing games. 
“It’s something we have to practice mentally and physically,” Whittingham said. “We have to play the same regardless of the score.”
USC’s blocking came from middle blockers senior Elise Ruddins and junior Jordan Dunn. Ruddins recorded 2.5 blocks, Dunn put up two and junior outside hitter Niki Withers put up four as well. Continuing to improve the team blocking will help USC moving forward. 
“[Being] technically sound on our blocking,” Haley said. “We can score more points there.”
Continuing to be better at serving and blocking are keys for Haley as the team wraps up conference play in November. The team hit their targets, served with velocity and kept Colorado off of the net. All three combined for USC to keep a serving advantage against Colorado. 
“That’s a really good passing team,” Haley said. “And we hurt them with our serve.”
USC will spend the next two weeks on the road. They head out to face Arizona and Arizona State this week and then head up to Stanford and Berkeley next week. With the long travel ahead, Haley is looking to remain positive with his team.
 “We were strong enough to beat [Colorado] 3-0, and that’s a good thing,” Haley said. “Anything that’s not a drag on our team is a positive thing.”
What a drag it is getting older from the Rolling Stones song. In this case it is not getting better.
Saw the Utah match on Friday with the worst 2nd set ever witnessed in all the years going to see them play.
This has to be the most home losses in Coach Haley’s career at USC for one season.
Lucky this team wins one match on the road to finish out the year maybe at Cal or ASU.
2nd Wednesday in November big day for signing new recruits with middle blockers first priority on the list.

After a vicious September, the Trojan football team was treated to a much friendlier October. Whether it was an easier schedule, a change at quarterback, a blitzing defense or a combination of all of these factors, the Trojans took care of business throughout this month. The Trojans’ schedule this month was definitely an advantage compared to Cal’s, which draws attention to a larger problem within the Pac-12.
They did what they had to do, which was beat inferior teams. The victory against Cal followed a familiar script, albeit with an improved rushing attack. It is hard to tell whether or not sophomore running backs Ronald Jones II and Aca’Cedric Ware have found their groove, or if Cal’s run defense was just abysmal. 
More than anything else, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold continues to add a new dimension to his game every week. Although he overthrew junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster early on a deep ball, he was significantly more accurate on deep throws than in his previous start against Arizona. His rapport not just with Smith-Schuster, but with receivers sophomore Deontay Burnett and senior Darreus Rogers and tight end redshirt freshman Daniel Imatorbhebhe improves each week.
If he has one flaw that needs extra attention, especially before Washington, it is his penchant for fumbling. While the turnovers do hurt the momentum of the game, it is Darnold’s exciting style of play that has gotten the Trojans this far. Whatever Darnold gives up with his fumbles, he more than compensates for by extending drives with his feet and improvisational skills. After four straight victories, I think an occasional fumble is a fairly small price to pay for the masterpieces he orchestrates with his unique brand of quarterbacking.
Other than Darnold’s continued ascent and the brilliance of other skill position players like Rogers and junior three-way player Adoree’ Jackson, the Trojans’ performance offered more of the same. This welcomed consistency left plenty of time to notice an inexcusable error by the Pac-12 conference.
It is great for USC to win, and I am confident they would have still run through Cal if the Golden Bears were fresh, but there was no need for the Pac-12 to schedule Cal on a Thursday night against a team coming off a bye. This time it favored the Trojans, but luck has a way of reverting back to the mean, and one day commissioner Larry Scott’s disregard for player safety and welfare will haunt the Trojans. With less time to rest and prepare for their next game, the chance of injury increases.
Thursday night was another example of the Pac-12’s, and by extension the NCAA’s, hypocrisy regarding the well-being of student athletes. The only reason Cal was in this predicament was because of the TV deal struck by Scott with ESPN and FOX a few years ago. While a landmark deal was great for the conference as a whole, the TV deal didn’t exactly do the Trojans any favors.
The TV money is great for Washington State up in Pullman and Oregon State in Corvallis, but USC is a marquee program whose brand recognition generates way more revenue for the conference than they receive in an equally distributed share.  That is why watching the Trojans on Thursday was so frustrating; because the roles could have been just as easily reversed.
It shouldn’t be a surprise at this point though, as neither the NCAA nor the Pac-12 care about anything other than TV and sponsorship money. This is the same NCAA that unjustly leveled crippling sanctions on the Trojans. Disregarding the blatant bias in that ruling, the sanctions put the health of USC players at risk in the 2013 season when they fielded an NFL-sized roster for certain games.
This is the same Pac-12 that didn’t defend USC against the sanctions once Oregon and Stanford became the primary brands of the conference. It’s also the same conference that has engineered technological innovation to allow the widely recognized eager Utah and Colorado fan bases in Shanghai, China to watch the Utes and Buffaloes on the Pac-12 network, but cannot strike a deal with Direct TV. Time and time again, the Pac-12 and NCAA have let down players and teams by focusing solely on their TV deals. This time it didn’t cost USC, and actually helped them. However, much like the NCAA sanctions unfairly penalized the Trojans, inequity ultimately affects every team.
It would behoove the powers that be at USC and other major conference power brands to flex their might and force some changes from Larry Scott and company for scheduling games as well as the next TV deals and beyond. Or else in a few years USC might have a potential playoff trip ruined by a scheduling commitment beyond the team’s control.

Warren Poh | Daily TrojanSweet revenge · Junior driver Matteo Morelli led the No. 3 Trojans to a victory over No. 2 Cal with his four-goal performance on Saturday. The Trojans’ lone loss this season came against Cal in September.
In what was likely the men’s water polo team’s biggest game of the season so far, the crowd and band at Uytengsu Aquatic Center created an incredible atmosphere for Saturday night’s game against Cal. 
“It was a great crowd,” junior driver Matteo Morelli said. “They cheered for us from the beginning — we were really pumped up.” 
Not only did the student section rise to the occasion for the No. 3 Trojans’ rematch against No. 2 Cal, but the team also channeled all of its emotions from losing to the Bears in September to produce an efficient 10-6 win. 
“That was our only loss this year,” Morelli said. “We lost to Cal a month ago in the NorCal tournament, so we were really prepared to beat them this time.”
In a night where many Trojans stepped up to the occasion, none stood out more than Morelli, who followed up his three-goal performance against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps on Friday with a memorable four-goal output on Saturday night. He started the night’s scoring with a long shot three minutes in. After the two teams traded goals for most of the second quarter, being tied at 3-3, Morelli scored on a penalty shot to seize the lead. The Bears would never reach even with the Trojans again. 
When freshman two-meter Matt Maier scored a goal late in the second quarter, the Trojans secured a 5-3 halftime in what was an ideal situation for the underdogs. However, the Bears took little time to come surging back. In the third period, junior driver Blake Edwards netted to extend the lead to 6-3. Then the Bears quickly scored twice in a row, one on a penalty shot where junior goalie McQuin Baron was excluded from play. With the Men of Troy’s lead eroding at 6-5 and all of the momentum on Cal’s side, USC was in desperate need of a goal in order to seize back control of the game.  Morelli provided just that on a lob shot that just managed to fool Cal goalie Lazar Andric, floating into the corner of the net. 
Late in the game, the tandem of Morelli and junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards became too much for Cal. First Morelli assisted Edwards for an easy goal, and then Edwards returned the favor by assisting Morelli’s fourth goal. The game’s final goal with around six minutes left, saw Morelli once again assist Edwards on a play that resembled more of an alley oop than a water polo play. 
“We’re really good friends so we always hang out together, but also I think the team chemistry is great,” Morelli said. “Everyone loves each other, and we always hustle for each other. I think this year the chemistry is going to make a difference in the end.” 
While USC’s goal scoring effort was key in Saturday’s 10-6 victory, ultimately the defense was the difference. 
“It was pretty good to hold a team like Cal to six goals,” junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards said. “We smothered them on defense and they couldn’t really do anything.” 
Baron saved his best performance of the season for the biggest stage. He tied his season high with 16 saves, stifling Cal’s most prolific goal scorers. One of the bigger stories of the game was who would win between the MSPF’s best keeper in Baron and the conference’s leading goal scorer in Johnny Hooper. After holding Hooper to just one goal (Hooper’s second was on a penalty that Baron was excluded from), suffice it to say that Baron came out victorious. One sequence in the second quarter saw Baron reject two of Hooper’s shots in a row; the crowd went crazy.
One trademark of Saturday’s intense game was frequent finger wagging, reminiscent of former NBA player Dikembe Mutombo, whenever the defense produced a steal or save.
 “They did that kind of stuff to us last game when they beat us. We went into this game making sure that they knew it was our game,” Edwards said.

As the presidential election closes in, the barrage of news detailing the newest scandal becomes all the more rapid. What begins as a scan of your Facebook newsfeed or a few clicks on your favorite website unravels into an inexorable descent. After several minutes or several hours, we finally breach the surface, gasping for air, with a vague mix of negative emotions still haunting us. This election, especially as it spotlights the horrors occurring in Aleppo, Syria, has been an unprecedented circus in its capacity to both entertain and horrify, highlighting a disconcerting truth about modern media: Negativity sells. 
The media’s proclivity for the morose and shocking reflects that of the film industry. For years, scholars, critics and medical professionals have decried the film industry’s predilection for violence. Violent displays of physical force have become sexy, irresistible tropes that viewers ravenously consume and filmmakers willingly offer. Filmmakers fight off concerns about how their content might influence destructive, real-world behavior by framing their products as innocuous means of escape. The film industry’s indifference is ultimately indicative of its desire to make money. The same appears true in the news media, which has constructed stories as entertainment, to the detriment of its viewers and readers. 
The potential consequences of a news culture permeated with negativity are manifold. Most importantly, there are of course concerns about the consumers’ health. According to some psychologists, violent and negative media may have serious, long-lasting consequences. The work of Graham Davey, a British psychologist whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media violence, indicates that exposure to violent or negative media may exacerbate or contribute to the development of anxiety, depression, stress and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, negative news may color the way one perceives the world around him or her. For example, if the media makes one anxious or stressed, then one might subconsciously fixate on negative events, and be more likely to perceive neutral events as negative. 
“These images change our overall mood to a more negative one — more sad or more anxious — and it is this change in mood that leads to psychological changes in the way we attend to things around us,” Davey said in his work. “This can have a vicious cycle effect on mood generally for some time.”
What is clear from the research is that more positive news is needed to counteract the negativity we encounter in the media. In late 2014, Stephen Pinker and Andrew Mack, a psychologist and international studies professor, respectively, wrote in a Slate article that the world, in contrast to the shocking images that media headlines evoke, is actually becoming more peaceful. Violence across a spectrum, including the prevalence of mass killings, is at an all-time low. Though we should neither discount human suffering where it exists nor neglect to address it, we should also recognize positive events and the alleviation of human suffering. With regard to the media, Pinker and Mack advocate for an “evidence-based mindset” that distinguishes real versus perceived danger facing our communities. Such a mindset, they argue, would limit the pernicious influence of terrorists, wayward journalists, misguided filmmakers and other “violence impresarios.” 
When negativity sells and the promise of positivity is not guaranteed, the onus falls on the viewer or reader to consciously consume the news. If the media leaves you in a sad fog every day, then take some simple steps to distance yourself from the negativity, like deleting news apps on your phone or allocating specific times to read or watch the news.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
Los Angeles has a homelessness problem. A looming public health issue for both the city and the state at large, the crisis has ballooned to epidemic proportions. Los Angeles’ Proposition HHH looks to many like a shining beacon signaling the final end to Los Angeles’ homeless issues — or at least a sign of progress. However, like so many other government interventions, the promises once made seem to lack fruition down the road. These are Band-Aid solutions from California’s insulated career politicians, who love these kind of self-entitling public relations boosting bills. L.A. residents must detect the failures of the city hall’s status quo in this election and vote accordingly.
By and large, the sane among the voting public don’t like to burn money as a recreational hobby — this bill begs to differ. Ultimately it fails to solve the roots of the problem: Housing stock capacity in Los Angeles. The bill proposes a $1.2 billion dollar bond-funded initiative to create housing for 8,000-10,000 homeless residents, conveniently ignoring the fact that over 40,000 homeless residents currently occupy L.A. County.
 In the end, homelessness is a result of, in the most obvious terms, the lack of a home. Many ask why there aren’t enough homes — the answer? The same reason that there is a Proposition HHH in the first place: Government oversight. The city of Los Angeles and the state of California suffer from some of the most restrictive development regulations in the United States, when both the Los Angeles municipal code and the state California Environmental Quality Act are taken into consideration. Los Angeles continues to be counterproductive with efforts to restrain development with the proposed “Neighborhood Integrity” Initiative on the ballot, a side effect of Not In My Backyard (residential resistance to development) across the city. California, however, is beginning to take constructive approaches to solve housing availability issues and alleviate burdensome development regulations. Gov. Jerry Brown’s recent “by right” development standards aim to fast track developments if they meet local zoning requirements and provide a set quota of affordable units. However, as it stands, demand outstrips supply, causing prices to skyrocket and housing accessibility to plummet.
HHH also incentivizes homeless citizens to migrate from cities with few homeless housing programs to the city of Los Angeles. With incentive comes a growth of demand. Free programs attract more homeless residents and do little to help the homeless population that already resides in Los Angeles. Transient populations will travel from neighboring cities and even neighboring states to use any new homeless housing services, making the local problem even worse. There need to be larger solutions working on a larger scale at the root of the problem to make a lasting solution and not an expensive temporary stop gap.
Even if one were to argue that HHH will make a dent in homelessness in Los Angeles (and a dent if anything is all HHH will do) there is still the issue of poor financing of HHH. Taxes to fund Proposition HHH will come from widely considered improper sources, if one were to believe in a tax increase in the first place. Tax revenues from property taxes will be mostly based on Proposition 13 reassessments, unfairly putting a large portion of the tax burden on new homeowners, and individuals who have improved their homes resulting in a county assessor value reassessment. Los Angeles is also home to restrictive rent control laws and thus restrictive tenant cash flow. With an increase in property taxes, landlords alone will be responsible for creating the extra capital to pay for any tax increase as landlords can’t pass tax increases onto renters, even if said renters are wealthy residents. A faulty destination for the increased tax funding to be created by HHH would be specifically directed to the construction of homeless housing. More emphasis needs to be placed upon more important initiatives such as counseling services and homeless shelters already under operation. 
When voters hit the polls on Nov. 8, they must consider the facts, and not just the politicians’ empty promises. There are much better solutions both to help the root causes of homelessness and to allocate funds toward homeless support causes in Los Angeles.
Chad – appreciate you writing in, but you should consider the facts. 1) The band-aid solutions and status quo would be doing what we’re doing right now, which is funding emergency services without a destination for those being served – that’s like leaving airplanes stranded on the tarmac without giving them a gate to land in. 2) This is a City proposition, and the units built would address 100% of the 9,000 chronically homeless households in the City. 3) Any time there’s been a real investment in this approach – whether with veterans in LA or with the broader population in Utah, the population has decreased 50-90% – the “if you build it they will come” fear is a fallacy. 4) This is a 0.01% tax on property – seems like a microscopic charge and small benefit for this payoff.
