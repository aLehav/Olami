Love isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be.
This is the message of director Derek Cianfrance’s Blue Valentine, which initially landed a controversial and puzzling NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.  Blue Valentine contains nothing that will shock the reasonable or seasoned filmgoer.

The movie is a love story that authentically depicts how two people find each other, fall in love and ultimately devastate each other.
Starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as the film’s doomed lovers Dean and Cindy, Blue Valentine goes back and forth between the years of their courtship and marriage. With dedicated, compelling performances, the two actors show off a fierce commitment to their characters that will refresh and move the most cynical members of the audience.
In the scenes where Cindy and Dean are a tired, married couple raising a child and teetering on the brink of divorce, Williams and Gosling show added pounds and a sense of exhausted misery that usually has no place in the glamorous courtships of traditionally fluffy romantic comedies.
Actors like Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis and James Franco have all received Oscar attention for their grueling physical commitments to Black Swan and 127 Hours, respectively — as they should — but there is a more honest merit in Gosling and Williams’ endeavors. The two even lived on set in character along with Faith Wladyka, who plays Cindy and Dean’s daughter, Frankie.
There is something inexplicably and unnervingly real about the arguments and differences that Gosling and Williams communicate in this film.
This is no searing, soaring love epic with flying doves and sweeping views of the great American countryside set to the sound of violins. Instead, moviegoers witness a raw, broken dialogue between two damaged people screaming at one another, cut with Grizzly Bear’s wistful soundtrack and Gosling’s original song, performed on a single, sad ukulele on the gray streets of regular suburban Pennsylvania.
As Cindy dances during one of their first dates, Dean sings to her,“You always hurt the ones you love.”
Cianfrance’s past experience as a cinematographer is apparent. There’s a pedestrian warmth to the feel of the film.
When Cindy and Dean first meet, Cindy’s youthful, makeup-free face seems to glow, while Dean’s unkempt appearance seems rugged and fetching. But as they try to salvage their connection in a seedy motel room eight years later, the entrancing luminescence becomes a fluorescent and garish blue-gray.
Surprisingly enough, Cianfrance executes Blue Valentine in a way that doesn’t delve deeply into the misery that independent films can sometimes express.
Wladyka’s charming performance as the innocent yet loud Frankie acts as a nice temperance to the doom and gloom, as does Cindy and Dean’s intangible but palpable sense of chemistry.
And there is no “bad guy” between the two protagonists. The script and direction weave a story in which two opposing characters are at a delicate balance with one another — a stunning feat for a subtle and simple film like Blue Valentine.
Williams and Gosling deserve kudos for rendering their characters equally relatable and flawed, allowing for a complex and intelligent experience.
There is nothing obviously new about Blue Valentine. The story is familiar, the writing supportive but not outstanding.
The film’s performances and bluntness, though, allow the moviegoer to walk away tingling with memories of an unpretentious and insidiously recognizable story of how two people are at once perfect for and totally incompatible with one another.

If the Academy Awards is the mother of all film award shows, the Golden Globes is the rebellious daughter.
The awards show, airing this Sunday on NBC at 5 p.m. PT, has gained the reputation of being the “fun show” of award season.
It’s the first major award show of the year and also the one where they serve alcohol. It’s just more fun to watch acceptance speeches from actors who’ve had a few drinks.
But with its lack of pretense comes a lack of prestige, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the small voting body of the Globes, is not known for its sophisticated or discerning taste.
I know The Hangover was funny, but the best comedy of the year? Nominating Tom Cruise for Tropic Thunder? Really? In looking at only a couple of categories for this year’s Golden Globes, it’s obvious the HFPA’s talent for choosing nominees has only grown worse.
Best Picture Comedy or Musical
The list of nominees for Best Comedy or Musical is, frankly, a joke. At least Red and Alice in Wonderland were fun to watch and had incredibly talented ensemble casts (though by no means was the full potential of either cast utilized, and neither achieved much narrative coherence).
But The Tourist? I didn’t think anybody even liked The Tourist, nor is it a musical or a comedy.
And nominating both Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie for their performances is quite a stretch, considering they were generally lambasted by critics for their lack of chemistry.
Even worse is nominating Depp twice in the same category. That’s just a lack of creativity.
Burlesque, however, is the crowning what-were-they-thinking nomination of the evening. Its musical status is the only fathomable reason, albeit a bad one, that the critically trashed Cher/Christina vehicle could have been nominated.
Burlesque actually has three nominations, though the other two are, more understandably, in the Best Original Song category.
The musical is also being considered for five Razzies, the awards honoring the year’s worst films.
It’s a little sad to think the Razzies’ voting body, which consists of anybody who wants to join, might have better taste than the HFP.
The HFPA’s one chance to validate the otherwise appalling Best Comedy/Musical category is their nomination of The Kids Are All Right.
The film is the only nomination in the Musical or Comedy category worthy of discussion. It’s in another class entirely from the other nominees and likely to receive a well-deserved Best Picture Oscar nod as well.
If Kids doesn’t win on Sunday, the Globes will quash the last ounce of credibility they have. There may not have been many stand-out comedies this year  — aside from Toy Story 3, which is sadly relegated to the Animated Film category — but the disappointing list of nominees definitely makes you question the Globes’ tradition of splitting up the Comedy/Musical and Drama categories.
It’s true that comedies deserve far more recognition during awards season — and The Kids Are All Right having the chance to win Best Picture surely shows the benefit of dividing the categories — but it’s not worth it if it means nominating films that don’t stand up against the dramas in terms of quality. Maybe the HFPA just needs higher standards.
Best Picture Drama, Director, and Screenplay
In spite of the largely embarrassing Best Comedy/Musical category, the Best Drama, Director and Screenplay nominees are all the predictable award season favorites.
The Social Network, The Fighter, Black Swan, Inception and The King’s Speech get the most love, but there are a few notable absences.
Surprisingly, True Grit is conspicuously missing from the nominee list altogether, despite a critical consensus that it will be a major Oscar player. 127 Hours is rightfully up for Best Actor and Screenplay, yet missing from the Director and Picture categories.
But such snubs will most likely prove irrelevant when The Social Network sweeps the major categories. Black Swan might offer the strongest competition, but Darren Aronofsky is unlikely to take Best Director from David Fincher, and Aaron Sorkin surely has a lock on Best Screenplay.
With such a variety of nominees ranging from the brilliant to the just plain bad, let’s just hope the Hollywood Foreign Press can at least get something right on Sunday.

I really hope Johnny Depp WIN!!!…I LOVE HIM!!!…And I ‘d like to see your faces critics!!!

Inspired by pop star Britney Spears, sophomore vocal performance major Meghan Mahowald always knew she wanted to sing but just didn’t know what type of venue would suit her — until she arrived at USC. 
Growing up with the likes of Paramore and No Doubt flooding her MP3 player, Mahowald sang country, participated in a pop group and performed in musical theater. It wasn’t until she came to USC that she realized singing rock was her passion and that she felt most comfortable with the pop-punk style.
In addition to singing, Mahowald is also a songwriter.
“I didn’t realize I could really write songs ‘til my senior year of high school, and toward the end of high school I realized that musical theater is great but I want to be in a band and I want to sing on stage, I want to write and sing about my own experiences,” she said.
In her songs, Mahowald writes about everything from boy troubles to the tough life experiences sparked by her father’s passing when she was in 7th grade. The only girl among four brothers, she was forced to mature at a young age. As a result, songwriting became a means to express her colorful emotions.
A few weeks into her freshman year, Mahowald, who is now a sophomore, met classmate and guitarist Matias Mora and immediately began writing songs with him. Since then, guitarist Rob Nagelhout, bassist Hunter Porter and drummer A.J. Novak — all Thornton sophomores  — joined the duo to form the up-and-coming pop-punk group, MEGG.
Although together for less than a year, MEGG has been quite prolific, releasing an EP and recording a music video. Ryan Silva, a friend at NYU, noticed Mahowald’s upbeat first single, “Break Up With Her,” and saw her potential. He proposed that MEGG create a music video to help publicize their music. Mahowald eventually agreed. She swiftly put together an artistic team comprised of USC sophomores Shayna Thea, a computer science and business administration major, and Justin Bettman, a business major, to film, edit and co-direct the music video.
“Everything was low budget, student run; we did it at my house, put a stage over my pool and invited all my friends and just kind of did it,” Mahowald said.
During the course of two days, the band recorded its first music video and also grew closer.
Despite MEGG’s astounding success, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the young aspiring artist. Between juggling her classes, performing in MEGG and having a social life, Mahowald struggles to find balance.
“It’s a lot of work because you have schoolwork and the music classes in the pop music program are extremely difficult so I have all those classes I have to balance, plus my GE, plus we have class bands in pop performance class,” she said.
To fellow aspiring artists, she recommends, “Do the work. You can have the talent and all that, but it really comes down to putting the work and time and you have really got to love what you’re doing. It’s a lot of time, a lot of hours and sacrifices and if you love what you’re doing, it’s worth it, but you have definitely got to put the work in.”
In the upcoming months, Mahowald hopes to build a larger fan base, work with other producers to release more EPs, perform at different venues, shoot another music video and perhaps tour this summer — and maybe even play some California dates for Warped Tour.
Mahowald’s energy seems limitless; she’s even been working on a clothing line that will hopefully be released in fall 2011.
To hear and find out more about MEGG, you can purchase MEGG’s music on iTunes, visit www.meggmusic.com or go on YouTube and search“OfficialMEGGMusic.” MEGG will also be playing a show at Tommy’s Place on Jan. 15 at 9:30 p.m.

In 2010, pop culture got a little crazier. Katy Perry shot whipped cream from contraptions strapped to her chest in the video for “California Gurls,” box office sales rose with the reality-challenging Inception, and the exploding popularity of Jersey Shore landed Snooki inside a falling ball on New Year’s Eve. But none of this compares to what 2011 has in store when it comes to movies, music and the good ‘ol television tube.
Melancholia
Lars von Trier’s films are, by rule of thumb, as joyful as a vasectomy. But the Danish bad boy has already vamped up his latest project with a tantalizing promise: an unhappy ending. As though the genital-squashing finale of Antichrist was purely cathartic by contrast, von Trier’s darker Melancholia is ominously billed as a disaster film regarding a planetary collision.
Boasting a truly bizarre cast, including Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland and Kirsten Dunst, Melancholia has already begun filming in Germany and is expected to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Those envisioning a spectacle of digital chaos are strongly advised to check out Von Trier’s Dogville and Breaking the Waves, whose respective tales of sexual violation are complimented by stark, nearly unbearable minimalism.
If anything, the production of Melancholia suggests that Roland Emmerich’s monopoly on the filmed cataclysm might soon be challenged.
M83
After many months of touring behind the gorgeous John Hughes love letter Saturdays = Youth, French synth sorcerer Anthony Gonzalez has reportedly returned to his orchestral, apocalyptic roots.
Currently based in Los Angeles, Gonzalez has described his forthcoming LP as “very, very, very epic.” Given the stereo-crippling waves and choral screams of Before The Dawn Heals Us and  Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, this early tease practically carries a warning for all potential listeners to invest in a new subwoofer and a reputable ear specialist.
Still, if Gonzalez has retained his usual melodic mastery and added a new Juno to the keyboard collection, the new disc is likely to be one of the more mesmerizing works of the year. Expect some of the 20 already-recorded demos to hit the web in the coming months and — if we’re lucky — an early M83 gig or two in our own fair city.
The Final Oprah
If the finale of Lost was worthy of generating an announcement from The White House on its conflict with President Obama’s state of the union address, the closing episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show might literally be declared a national holiday.
After 25 seasons of book endorsements, galvanizing guest spots and party favors that would make Solomon blush, Winfrey’s series will come to an end Sept. 9. What this mythic hour of network television will entail is anyone’s best guess. Compilations of past broadcasts and tearful embraces are likely, but one can always hope for a conclusion more worthy of David Copperfield: an apparition of stuffed snow peas, the revelation that Oprah cordially loathes reading, an exit through the ceiling via smoke and concealed wires?
The world will be watching.
The Walking Dead Season 2
Halloween night 2010 got a little more intense with the premiere of The Walking Dead, the intricately psychological, gore-happy AMC series based on Robert Kirkman’s graphic novel of the same name. The first season added some embellishments to the original work but stayed mostly true to the storyline and the psychological depth. The cast breathed life into the characters and the zombies were terrifically bloody and dead.
The show captured the attention of three to four million viewers within the first season and the ending left the characters to fend for themselves after finding another survivor and escaping from an exploding Center for Disease Control building.
With many other upcoming premieres, including a new season of Breaking Bad, AMC has to yet to find the right date for the horror show to reel in viewers once again — and the wait may last until Halloween 2011.
Sucker Punch
It’s rare to watch a movie about scantily clad girls wielding swords against fire-breathing dragons. So why not make a two-hour movie about it? The trailer for director Zach Snyder’s newest film features loud music, video game-like graphics and a tale about a few girls with names like “Baby Doll” and “Sweet Pea” fighting all sorts of creatures to fulfill a mysterious quest in a world far from reality.
Predictably enough, the story takes place in a mental asylum, where the patients look for something beyond the mental asylum and their horrid lives.
The group of girls is pitted against the evil men of the nuthouse and the slow-mo fights against creatures gives glimpses of what resembles a fantasy-like, psychological action film. The flick is set to hit theaters March 25 — and oddly enough includes Disney star Vanessa Hudgens.
Born This Way
You either love or hate Lady Gaga. The raw meat outfit, catchy tracks and gutsy music videos landed the artist a top spot in not only the music industry, but in popular culture.
This next year will determine whether the strange starlet will continue stretching her stardom or whether music fans will finally lose interest. Her new album, Born This Way, is set to hit the music world May 23 — and only Gaga knows what she will concoct to outdo her precedents for the shocking and the strange. Because of how much attention she received in 2010, the album can’t be anything less than absolute madness.
Oops, the filming dates were July 22 – September 8, 2010 in Trollhattan, Sweden — this is the 4th film von Trier has made at the studios in Trollhattan.  Your info that it was filming in Germany may have arisen from the international nature of the funding and producers some of which are from Germany.  The majority of the movie is a Scandinavian project.
And since you mentioned some of the cast, it would be good to mention Alexander Skarsgard and John Hurt along with Charlotte Rampling.  The film was made with no rehearsals with a great deal of input from the cast unlike most of von Trier’s previous films which were noted for their rehearsal.
Nice to see some publicity on Melancholia but I would be happier if your info was more accurate.  It filmed in Sweden in September and early October 2010, not in Germany.  Filming has been over for several months.  Several Swedish historic landmarks are integral to the film and add to the melancholic theme of the movie.

Hidden beneath the idealistic vision of a “dream school” is the assumption that every young student or young person has an implicit right to dream this dream.
For some people, however, that dream might never become a reality: In December 2010, the Senate blocked the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, a bill that would provide a path for young illegal immigrants to attend college and eventually become legal U.S. citizens despite their current illegal status.
The DREAM Act requires students to have arrived in the United States before age 16 and have completed two years of college education or military service. The students have six years in which to complete their education or service, and upon doing so, can obtain legal U.S. citizenship.
Though the immigration debate is complex and requires a cautious approach, opponents were basing their argument on an incorrect assumption, criticizing the bill for granting amnesty to undeserving people and for encouraging more illegal immigration.
“Dream school” is a commonplace phrase for students today. High schoolers pin their hopes and aspirations onto the college that they think will allow their dreams to come true.
Both college and the military provide space for community, connection and growth. These are the kind of places young people need to motivate themselves and realize their dreams.
Is that a requirement for citizenship? Not really. But it is something any young person who is willing to apply themselves deserves, citizen or not.
The DREAM Act is motivated by a humane vision of young illegal immigrants and their genuine needs as human beings, not as faceless illegal immigrants.
It’s also motivated by the belief that the societal benefits of education compensate for doubts about whether or not citizenship is deserved.
A limited rhetoric dominates our nation’s anti-immigrant debate and doesn’t allow for an understanding of the value of potential DREAM Act students, and in a broader sense, the value of our educational system. The fact that the DREAM Act uses education as a path to citizenship points to the power and role education has to change lives.
On the The Daily Beast, an anonymous illegal immigrant student, who has lived in the U.S. since she was four years old and is now a senior at Harvard University, described her challenges as an undocumented college student.
“School has always been my sanctuary … a respite from reality, a place where I could be loved and appreciated for my mind and my heart.”
Education holds this unique power as a space without borders — separate but not disconnected from the burdens of reality — where everyone is allowed equal opportunity to dream.
For the DREAM Act to pass, we need to adjust our mindset about illegal immigration is necessary. It should be understood that everyone, regardless of where they were born or where they are now, needs a sanctuary. A dream school. A place to dream. Or maybe just a dream.
As students at USC who are being allowed to live this dream, we understand the value of education and community.
The young people fighting for the passage of this bill are not criminals. They are immigrants, brought here by their parents, who grew up and were educated in the United States.
Why should they not be able to dream like those of us who were born here?

Immigration works only if you get rid of the welfare state.
There are illegal immigrants from all over the world NOT just Mexico. Everyone that comes here has to face many dangers and many times might end up not making it alive. Most leave everything behind for the search of a better future and to fly from the discriminations and horrible conditions in their native countries. They end up doing the jobs that no “AMERICAN CITIZENS” want to do and in return help the economy because YESSSSSSS! They do pay taxes! Since, they are “illegals” they don’t get to get their money back and that ends up staying with Uncle Sam and feeding all lazzy “AMERICAN CITIZENS”.  I feel the urge to vomit to see just how many ignorant people are just talking from their butts and with zero consideration to the Dreamers, who only want a better future. The fact that illegal immigrant students who are in prestigious schools such as Harvard, USC, UCLA and so on are denied their chance to citizenship….while a bunch of lazzy “AMERICAN CITIZENS”  can’t even graduate from high school makes me want to throw up. It’s a shame that people who say are “AMERICANS” talk with such a hate against people who do nothing to them but instead might bring bright things to the country that the “NATIVE CITIZENS” lack to provide . What makes me want to laugh in disgust is that all of the ones who show up such a American Pride are just a bunch of idiots that also come from immigrant backgrounds because  in the U.S.A. the only real Americans are Native Indians. Instead of complaining and blaming all the economy problems on immigrants people should start working and stop depending on wellfare and learn from the “aliens” who do nothing but work hard and should have their head held up high.
P.S.
Elena Kadvany you are an amazing writer.
The Dream Act will be a reality soon:)
You really want to “laugh in disgust” at the people commenting here, Theresa? My that’s a nice way to treat the nice, law-abiding, taxpaying people who pay for all of your free stuff.
millions  have come from Mexico illegally, have overstayed visas and stolen across our borders like sneak thieves, disrespecting our laws, culture and citizens. They are anarchists, further breaking our laws by using stolen Social Security numbers, fraudulent identity documents, driving without valid licenses or insurance, lying on I-9 forms and taking American jobs in an unholy alliance with criminal employers. They suck services and tax dollars from our economy and could care less about the very real and very extensive economic damage they have caused to American workers through lost jobs and reduced wages. They are dishonest with poor integrity and tarnished character. They have proven themselves to be unworthy of the most valuable citizenship in the world. The same holds true for illegal aliens of all nations.

Just more rude talk and insults directed at native-born Americans and taxpayers. Typical! Funny how my reply to self-righteous “Nina” was taken down as I guess it was too “unkind” but insults and name-calling directed at native-born Americans are allowed to remain. 
All the “arguments” here from the pro-illegal side boil down to one single thing: “We want free stuff from the gringoes. The gringoes have stuff that we don’t have, and we want it. ” 
At least have the decency and honesty to admit it.
The Dream Act’s final nail was hammered in its coffin. So why the commotion? Many of you are too emotional; state specious accounts of your stance for or against it; make rash generalizations; don’t expound on any of your premises; write superfluous fluff…and sadly, don’t know WTF you’re talking about. 
Oh, btw, I was against the Dream Act.
The purpose of immigration laws are to protect the host country’s economy and citizens. The US has the most generous immigration laws of any nation on earth. More than 3 million immigrants come to the US annually, more than the rest of the world combined! Illegal immigration drives down wages, drains scarce resources, and overwhelms social services. You can’t blame the poor illegal immigrants for wanting to better their situation, it is human nature. Just don’t expect Americans to justify it during the worst economy since the Great Depression. Some people have very sad, compelling stories that are inspirational. Yet, the reality remains the same. Without enforcement of our immigration laws, our nation and citizens will continue to suffer.
To All The Selfish and Ignorant Writers:
 I don’t even have to read your comments thoroughly to know you are spoiled little imbeciles. Have you ever really looked more into this then what was headlined. Or, do you just run your pesky imperfect mouths as you feel you have the right to. Any money is not free, but I’m not the least bit suprised that you wouldn’t know this. You do not look beyond yourself. Yet, you do not see in turn how this may benefit You. Ignorance is a sad sad thing and to think some of you are almni. What a joke. This state is in up to their head but many of you can’t see pass the word illegal. Have you all lost your imagination? Profits can be made here. It’s actually very simple, maybe you are just too stupid to get it. Because in the end we are all people. These are the ones who are going to live, work, and ultimately be beside you. I don’t know about you, but I want a productive society in the future. What better way to make this future a reality, then to educate the ones around us as we are educated. I seek progression. Are you really that lazy of a being, that you to turn to insolent remarks and lay hopeful for a better future for yourself. From the poorest to the richest person in the world you’ll never amount to anything if you don’t believe that things will always change. You must adapt. Accept what your peers don’t because this isn’t a production line and we are individuals. What if it were you? I bet that mostly all of you have no idea, not even a clue. You talk about breaking the law and this and that. All I see is excuses. It’s the funniest thing to see you feel threatened and it shows. If you only accepted what MUST be done we can move foward as a society. Your all nothing but a racist ignorant group, you can go back and forth and say “illegals need to leave” but I bet there is at least one person in your life who you might not expect to be illegal but is. The funniest part about your comments is that they are all the same. NO one of them are different. That’s how you can tell you are all so ignorant. What a shame. The bottom line is that you are selfish, scared, spoiled little brats. You are afraid that illegal immigrants are better than you and you’ll lose what you have not because of FUNDS but because of competition. I feel so embarrassed that you are the people who walk this earth with me. None of you understand, nor will you ever understand, because you don’t take into consideration other perspectives of this issue… and the sad thing is you probably never will. 
Just to clarify some issues you have brought up
-NOT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE FROM MEXICO
-YOUR GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THESE CRIMINALS BECAUSE ABOVE ALL THEY MAKE MONEY THAT THEY  TRY TO HIDE FROM YOU
-FOR ALL YOU TRYING TO DISPLAY THIS PEACEFUL WORLD, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT 1. IF ILLEGALS WERE GONE THE CRIMES WOULDN’T STOP OR LOWER. AND 2. IF THEY WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE DREAM ACT PROVIDES IT WILL ONLY SHOW THAT MORE CITIZENS ARE COMMITING THE CRIMES.
-IF WE ONLY ACCEPTED THAT ILLEGALS ARE GOING TO BE HERE WE CAN MAKE REVENUE BY LETTING THEM OBTAIN A DRIVERS LICENSE, JOBS FILLED = MORE SPENDING, ECT. THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE.
-THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT DESTROYED BY ILLEGALS IF YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY YOU WOULD SEE THAT ITS BECAUSE OF ILLEGALS THAT CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WAY BACK WHEN IS WHY THE AMERICAN DREAM EXIST
-AGE 30 IS A GREAT AGE, HOWEVER IT IS FAST APPROACHING FOR SOME SOONER THAN OTHERS, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GRADUATED FROM OUR SCHOOLS, TOOK SOME COLLEGE, WERE PRODUCTIVE UNLIKE THE 30 YEAR OLD CITIZEN WHO NEVER EVEN GOT HIS GED SITS ON THE COUCH ALL DAY AND LIVES AT HOME WITH HIS PARENTS
-AS FOR beast, YOU ARE NOT EVEN WORTHY ENOUGH FOR CAPITAL LETTERS. IF YOU ARE TRULY AN IMMIGRANT WHO DID “IT” LEGALLY. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO UTTER A WORD. YOU SHOULD KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACED. SHOULD I HAVE TO REMIND YOU? BUT UNLIKE YOU MANY OF THESE WORTHY ILLEGALS KNOW HERE AS HOME. THEY NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF THE US OTHER THAN BEING BORN AND BROUGHT HERE. BUT YOU WOULDN’T KNOW THAT. YOU DID THINGS LEGALLY, RIGHT? YOU ARE A VERY JEALOUS PERSON I CAN SEE. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAD TO DO IT A CERTAIN WAY. IT IS YOUR SELFISHNESS, THAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE ILLEGALS ARE ACTUALLY ROBBING YOU. HOPEFULLY ITS NOT TO LATE FOR YOU, YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOURSELF AND SAY WHY AM I TRYING TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM SUPPORTING OTHERS WHO ARE LIKE WHAT I USED TO BE. A PERSON STRUGGLING TO BETTER THEMSELVES AND HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES WHEN ALL ODDS ARE AGAINST THEM. YOU HAVE TO PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE. THINGS ARE PROBABLY WAY MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM THEN IT WAS FOR YOU. YOU PROBABLY HAD SUPPORT; WHEN THEY DON’T. I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY BE ANGRY BUT IS THIS REALLY HOW YOU WANT TO REPRESENT YOURSELF…
-LAST BUT NOT LEAST ALL NON SUPPORTERS SHOULD TAKE A SECOND LOOK
We are all SO TIRED of these illegal aliens coming here and demanding their “rights”, free education, free housing, food stamps, etc. We are also sick of hearing that they are all just coming here, “for a better life” (at the expense of ours of course)! YOU have worn out your welcome!! Go back to your crappy country and fix it!!  I have a “Dream” too, it’s that all these criminal parasites go back to their country of citizenship!! How many more DUI’s, rapes and murders must we endure at the hands of these illegal aliens!?!?
No one’s going to be persuaded by your hateful rhetoric and name-calling. This is just the short of rhetoric we hear all the time from illegals and their supporters. It’s all “gimme, gimme, gimme.” 
And when we say, “no, we are tired of giving,” we are called nasty names and abused. 
Well sorry but I’m sick of being insulted and abused by people who have their hands out demanding money and favors from me at the same time.
People who are not authorized and in this country illegally deserve nothing but to be sent back to their own country.  They should have a DREAM of being a good, law-abiding person by obeying our laws and DREAM of applying in the proper fashion to become a legal citizen.  Americans have no obligation to pay for all the benefits of non-citizens.  Perhaps these kids will learn a lesson about what happens and the consequences of skirting our laws.  Don’t blame American society cuz we dont’ want millions of illegals, blame your parents for killing your dream.
You are TOTALLY right American! There are no circumstances in which any illegal immigrant should EVER be allowed citizenship or the right to an education. 
For example, the 7 year old girl from El Salvador who’s family sent her to America by HERSELF to meet her 2 year old sister and mother who worked as a cleaning lady in Oakland, CA. Her father was caught by immigration coming across the border. Last week her mother and sister died in a fire that she survived. Her father will be deported after the funeral. She is 7 years old, alone, she has lost half of her family and her lone family member will be sent back to the country she just risked her life to escape from. 
You are right, she deserves to be treated like a criminal.
Elena,
As a Trojan Alum, I feel compelled to correct you on your seriously flawed assumptions on the Dream Act.
There is NO verification on the documents submitted by illegal alien students, so someone could print a college diploma as well as a fake birth certificate and no one would check to see if it authentic or not.  This would lead to wide spread fraud.  How does someone here illegally prove that they have been here for 5 years?  Why does this bill allow for people up to the age of 30?  They are not minors in any sense of the word.  
We do not reward illegal behavior, it is the ultimate slap in the face for those who waited for legal status (the way that I had to.)  I am an immigrant too, I came LEGALLY, I waited patiently.  How fair is it for people like me who did it right, rather than someone who jumped the border.  Should we allow these kids to take tests with an open book too?
What was a family doing sending a seven year old kid on such a dangerous journey by HERSELF? And how are Americans responsible for the fact that her family is irresponsible?
Already trying to spin the Arizona massacre to your political benefit, Anjamd? How truly disgusting. 
Saying things like “Education should have no borders” is impractical, utopian lefty dreaming. The American tax base certainly must have borders, or else we will be even more bankrupt than we are today!
We cannot afford to finance an education for the entire world. A welfare state without borders is not mathematically possible. 
American college seats and taxpayer-funded college aid belong to American citizens, period. There’s nothing stopping Mexico or any other country from building up their own educational system so they can offer a “Dream” to their own people. The fact is, Mexico is so corrupt, hardly anybody pays taxes so there is no money for social services and education. That is not America’s fault. 
Shaming language should be directed at Mexico’s corrupt culture and government, not at American citizens. Mexicans, pay your taxes and build your own welfare state — we
“gringoes” are maxed out.
With all due respect Maria, “Utopian, lefty dreaming” isn’t always a bad thing. Particularly in an article that discusses everyone’s right to the DREAM of an education. The Dream Act is not proposing free handouts to every illegal immigrant. It is allowing children who have been brought over the border with their families without choice the opportunity to become educated, contributing members of society. There are victims of illegal immigration besides the Americans losing jobs to illegal immigrants. The true victims are children who are brought into this country with their families hoping to find opportunity and are met with hate, poverty, and no promise of a future. 
To immediately shut down the idea of dreaming that someday, we can offer the promise of a better future for ALL children is not an indicator of fiscal responsibility, as you probably think it is, it is a sign of blatant unkindness. 
And to call Anjamd disgusting is unfair. Steve’s right-wing babble linking all illegal immigrants to vicious crimes like rape and murder is what is disgusting. 
And before you decide where to direct your “shaming language” you should consider that not all illegal immigrants are Mexican. Talk about shameful.
Arguably, it is impossible to spread the concepts of democracy, economic equity, and social justice to other nations, so long as our immigration policies practically invite breaking our laws. Human nature will dictate that rather than remain in their native land and do the hard work of building reforms, it’s just easier to slip across our borders and take advantage of American taxpayer largess. Eventually, even the self serving liberals who insist that everyone has a right to live in our country, will have to accept inarguable facts. Overpopulation, congestion, urban sprawl, diminishing resources, crumbling infrastructure, vanishing farm land and green space, water and energy shortages, oppressive competition for jobs, housing, education, overcrowded schools and hospitals, lack of affordable housing, crime, pollution, depressed wages, increased tax burdens, the marginalization of American workers, taxpayers and voters, the overall decline in quality of life, are all the result of unconstrained immigration and lax enforcement. Pragmatically speaking, even if we were able to ‘educate’ all the worlds poor at taxpayer expense, flooding the markets with deeply appreciative third world ‘professionals’ willing to work for less, would only undermine the educational, economic interests of educated Americans such as those posting here. All labor, even educated labor, is merely the reflection of supply and demand. Right now America’s middle class and lower wage earners are suffering as never before from unconstrained immigration. Soon even the ‘educated’ who seem to feel that efforts to ‘stabilize our nations explosive population growth’ are racist, will begin to feel crushed by the growing demands of a population that is either too lazy, too self interested, or too cowardly to work to implement social and economic reforms in their own corrupt nations! Like it or not folks, logic and pragmatism have a way of compelling solutions that some of you may not agree with. Too many people competing for the same limited resources is NOT, and NEVER WILL BE sane, sustainable social, economic or environmental policy.
Virtually every industrialized nation, China, Mexico, Great Britain, the European Union, Asia, the Middle East, have all adopted zero tolerance for illegal aliens, as well as strict enforcement and deportation policies. Further, the same nations have implemented policies aimed at curtailing legal immigration to only that which is prudent, that which is demonstrably necessary, that which is readily assimilated, and most important, limited only to that which is in the best interests of their native population. It’s dangerously misguided to suggest that the United States not do likewise. None of this is motivated by hatred or racism, but rather by the cold pragmatism of doing what’s right for generations of native born American’s who will have no say in the third world Babel that our present policies are creating!
That is all true Ed Weirdness, but they are not capable of hearing you or understanding you. Remember, it’s their culture that made Mexico what it is today — a failed state. They do not understand the concepts or behaviors that are required to maintain a First World, successful country. If they did, Mexico wouldn’t be a failed state that they are all trying to leave. 
Harsh but true.
Elena, what part of “illegal” do you not understand? You break the law, then there’s a consequence. When you get a job and pay taxes, let me know how you feel about paying for free breakfast, free lunch, free bus transportation to/from school k-12, and then college for people who are in this country illegally. This doesn’t even include the medical costs, legal costs, and incarceration costs. When there’s no $ left in the bank, you have no money left to spend. There are limits to everything. Do you think Mexico would pay for the education and medical needs of Salvadorans & Guatemalans? Think again!
Alexis, 
You are the worst.
Happy new year!
Love,
Betty
Alexis,
Keep your stupid comments in your pocket,
-Mark
Now that’s really convincing political rhetoric. NOT!
A sympathetic group indeed, but any more sympathetic than the 18-20 million Americans who are out of work? We’re not talikng about the ‘huddled masses’ that will take ‘jobs Americans won’t do’.  We’re talikg about a motly educated group of people who will compete for and take jobs that Americans DO want. First, the timing is bad, and second, the bill offers no preventative measures that will prevent illegal aliens from coming in in the future. Without such safeguards, this type of legislation will not pass muster with the American people.
Many elitist Americans speak very flippantly about the American Dream. It is totally unavailable to the 4 billion people in the world that survive on $2 or less a day, because they cannot steal across our border in the middle of the night. Our present mass of illegal invaders come from much better circumstances than those truly poor billions. The present mass of illegal invaders have, in an unholy alliance with greedy, criminal employers, actually destroyed the American Dream for millions of Americans by driving wages down and stealing paychecks from Americans by committing felonies, using stolen and/or forged SS numbers and other IDs.No ‘dream act’ until our own 43 million Americans living in poverty and 22 million unemployed Americans are addressed!
Every illegal needs to get packed and get in this new year.  Im tired of hearing about wetbacks. Take your anchor babies back to  mexico, we dont want them here. We dont want any illegals here……………..
Like you say you dont want illegals in your country!! You can Be more Respectful with theme cause i have to tell you something Illegals are who pay more taxes than you do and your country is everyday better because the illegals!! You should work hard.. like they does’  you want them out well go for it… and work more
Our Government, has allowed the invasion of 30 million criminals in direct violation of Article IV, Section IV of our Constitution. they force American tax payers to pay Billions to provide Welfare, Prison cells, Educate the invaders children, free medical care,massive document fraud, & are destroying our schools, hospitals, communities, culture while Robbing, Raping, Killing & Assaulting American Citizens WAKE UP PEOPLE!

Every Non-representative including obama and holder need to be IMPEACHED! for not upholding the oath of office they swore to defend the Constitution! If these clowns were to do their job, this would all be a Moot point!
 Anchor babies and their criminal parents go, period, and cut the phony tears, you knew you were breaking the law when you crossed the border.
Next shut down any business hiring illegal labor and confiscate all property belonging to the owner. Property will be sold at auction and the proceeds to pay for the massive deportation. Oh and owners go to jail.
 Got a better idea? Lets hear it!
Steve ‘s been drinking the crazy tea. Your arguments and mindset gave us the tragedy in Tucson last Saturday. Dial it back and start taking your meds. When you are more sane, actually look at facts and figures not put forth by white supremacist anti immigrant organizations. You ll be surprised how much you been lied to.

Students might not be aware that Geoff Palmer, a local real estate developer, is demolishing a downtown orthopedic hospital to build luxury housing units.
But we must make our voices heard against the project if we are to preserve the well-being of our community.
What is upsetting about the proposed “Lorenzo Project,” is that the land has a “Q” condition,—a zoning regulation that maintaining that the plot of land can only be used for education or health services only.
Palmer has been lobbying hard for L.A.’s planning commissioners to lift the “Q” condition on the property. Without the commissioners’ approval, the project cannot proceed.
Community and student activists are, and should be, opposed to the project precisely because of zoning regulations—  which are in place to make sure that working-class neighborhoods have access to much-needed health services.
According to a study by Community Health Councils Inc., South Los Angeles, compared with the rest of the country, has the “population with the highest overall rates of disease and premature deaths in the county from such preventable conditions as coronary heart disease, homicide, diabetes, lung cancer and motor vehicle crashes.”
The study also found that the South Los Angeles area is severely lacking in health care services.
For example, in South Los Angeles there are 11 pediatricians for every 100,000 children, whereas L.A. County as a whole has 57 pediatricians and West Los Angeles has 193 pediatricians for the same number of children.
The community also needs affordable housing.
The group United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement said that, according to 2000 Census data, 25 percent of households in South Los Angeles are “severely overburdened” by their rent because they spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing.
But it’s not just local, long-time
residents that would benefit from affordable housing.
“With the cost of tuition rising every year, students shouldn’t have to deal with increasing shelter costs as well,” said Jonathan Truong, a member of USC’s Campus Community United, a coalition that works to empower local neighborhoods. “We need access to more safe, healthy and economical housing options.”
USC students also deal with the heavy burden of rising housing costs.
The Community Advisory Committee for Council District 9 (where USC and the proposed Lorenzo Project are located), appointed by the Council District 9 office and composed of homeowners, businesses and community organizations, unanimously voted to withhold their recommendation for the project to the city’s commissioners after hearing extended arguments and testimony from both Palmer and local residents.
Despite the local opposition from student groups and residents, community groups and the CAC, Palmer is moving ahead as if the project were fully approved.
This is the same developer who, in 1992, was found guilty of 15 violations of the California Political Reform Act and agreed to pay $30,000 in fines.
In 2004, Palmer agreed to pay $2.8 million for a series of lawsuits that charged him with failing to include not including necessary affordable housing units. Now, the developer’s current plans are a cause for concern.
Clearly, Palmer already has a questionable history when it comes to his business dealings. And there is no reason to allow him to continue his current plans.
Therefore, we have a stake in rising up against a construction project that puts recklessness ahead of the will of the people.
For those who want to have their voice heard, the city’s planning commission’s final vote on the Q condition will be Wednesday, Jan. 13th at 8:30  a.m. in City Hall.
Let us not miss an opportunity to take a stand against this project — a project being conducted at the expense of our  local health and housing needs.
This could be a chance for  the student body to defend its community. Let’s not disappoint it.
Max Hoiland is a senior majoring in film and critical studies.
Good article but many errors. Proofing needs to tighten up. But I like the information provided – informative.
Good article but it looks like the vote is on Thursday, not Wednesday
The name is the Orthopaedic Hospital.  Thanks for the support.
Naming the hospital that is at risk for closure would be helpful, ya think?
Great Article!!

Jan. 1, 2011, was always going to be a landmark day for firsts.
Middle schoolers (and inevitably some of us grown ups) gleefully awaited the moment they could wish at 11:11 on 1.1.11. Determined resolution-makers vowed that with the power of all those ‘1’s behind them, this would be the year they finally ran the marathon, wrote the Great American Novel or finished cleaning the garage.

Environmental policy makers seem to have been thinking along the same lines.
The new year rang in a new era for green legislature in California. On Jan. 1, the California Building Standards Commission enacted the California Green Building Code, the first mandatory green building code not just in the state, but also in the nation.
Most tenets of CALGreen are the familiar after-school special pitches we’ve been hearing for years: Waste less water. Recycle more trash. Remember that paint fumes are very, very bad.
The difference is that from here on out, these pitches will be mandated.
Mandating the quotas for recycling and water reduction in new buildings is costly, as is pretty much any step in the drive toward becoming environmentally solvent. It’s a legitimate argument for those who don’t want to pony up the extra cash that they themselves should be able to choose how to spend their money.
But California’s growing emphasis on green policy has been carrying the state toward this jump for some time, and now that the first step has been taken policy makers would be hard pressed to find one that better serves the state.
CALGreen gives us the benefit of a standardized building code that will be enforced in the same manner in every county across the state, freeing us from confusion about which codes supersede others. It keeps the state on the path to meet the goals of Assembly Bill 32, California’s Global Warming Solutions Act. There’s even talk the new codes could create additional green industry jobs.
And in the end, it has the same added perk that all California precedents do, particularly the environmental ones: It compels the rest of the nation to sit up and take notice. It’s a safe bet that as CALGreen moves forward, other states will begin to draft similar legislature.
Although CALGreen’s requirements of buildings that are already well-established are more relaxed, all new construction sites — even ones that are already underway — are fair game; which means it won’t affect EVK, but it could certainly affect the University Village remodel or any number of projects in USC’s 30-year Master Plan.  
USC Sustainability recently promoted several seminars to help understand the impact CALGreen will have on construction in Los Angeles.
CALGreen isn’t perfect. Numerous organizations, including the Northern California Chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council and the Sierra Club, have expressed concern that the new codes will undermine the jurisdiction of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)  and ultimately be a new source for the same kind of confusion it’s trying to clear up.
But California has faced far worse than conflicting legislature. Once the dust of the new codes settles, we can start focusing on its benefits.
According to the California Air Resources Board, CALGreen is estimated to save a CO2 equivalent of 3 million metric tons by 2020.
“This is something no other state in the country has done,” Tom Sheehy, undersecretary and designated acting secretary of the California State and Consumer Services Agency and Chair of the Building Standards Commission, said in a statement last year. “CALGreen will essentially revolutionize the way we build structures. By implementing a sensible, cost-effective foundation of green practices, our state will usher in a new era of greener communities.”

The USC men’s and women’s swim teams both found success and kicked off the new decade powerfully this weekend by sweeping the UCSB Gauchos in a home meet. The Women of Troy defeated the Gauchos with a total score of 156-92, while the Trojan men swept the UCSB swimmers over the course of two meets, 140-44 in the first and 136-47 in the second.
With the No. 5 women’s record now 8-0 and the No. 9 men’s 6-1, the Trojan teams did well to prove themselves as teams to watch out for. On the men’s side, the USC swimmers easily overcame the Gauchos and won first place in the majority of the meets’ events. Equally impressive, the women’s team had five swimmers—seniors Lyndsay DePaul and Presley Bard, sophomores Haley Anderson and Christel Simms and freshman Stina Gardell—who each won two events apiece, ensuring the Women of Troys’ victory as well.
The Jan. 8 meet marked the first time that USC met with the UCSB Gauchos since the UCSB men’s team joined the Pac-10 last fall. The Gaucho’s women’s team is in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
With this meet, the last home one for the men’s team, the Trojan teams added another victory to their already successful season against the unranked Gauchos. At the beginning of December, the Trojan swimmers went to compete at Nationals–one of their most important competitions–but not only did they compete, they brought home multiple titles and broke numerous records.
Swimmers like freshman Vladimir Morozov, who broke USC’s school record in the 50y and 100y three times at Nationals, and junior Katinka Hosszu, who walked away from Nationals with four titles, proved essential this weekend and at meets earlier this season.
Now that the men’s and women’s teams have defeated the Gauchos, their next opportunity to compete will come on Friday at the SCS Grand Prix in Long Beach and will continue until next Monday. The diving team will also compete this weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, at the UCLA Diving Invitational.
