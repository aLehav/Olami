I went to a small record shop in Highland Park with a substantial classical music section a few days ago. Most music stores only have a sliver of opera and symphonic recordings compared to the surplus of overlooked one-hit wonders of the ’70s and ’80s. I’ve scoured enough record shops to know that the good stuff is usually scooped up moments after it hits the shelves, but it’s different with classical music. Though it is disheartening that it’s not nearly as popular as other genres of music, it does mean that I get my pick of the litter of the best recordings. Among the treasures that I found was a slim vinyl containing highlights from Lucia di Lammermoor for only $4, featuring Maria Callas with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus. It was a tiny gem among morsels, though with my diminishing funds I figured it was better to keep it light.
There is a small list of things that I find more tantalizing than listening to stars of the early- and mid-20th century. Examples include Enrico Caruso, Jussi Björling, Victoria de los Ángeles and (obviously) Maria Callas, just to name a few. The sound quality of these live recordings are obviously not as clear as those created with today’s equipment, but I romanticize the static and imperfections of these antiquated systems. More than that, the reason I love this era of opera is because of how influential the art was in pop culture. Opera singers were true celebrities in those days. Performances with these stars were sold out on a regular basis. They appeared frequently on the radio and late-night talk shows. Decades later, their influence and mastery would be immortalized as the answer to a Jeopardy! question. But things are different now, and the biggest difference is that idea of the diva or divo no longer exists.
The idea of the diva seems to be an antiquated concept. Nowadays, many of the leading ladies of the opera stage present an image that differs from the haughty nature of the traditional prima donna from previous centuries.

On the same note, men in this profession aren’t expected to adhere to the Herculean stereotype of yesteryear. But when did the shift happen? Perhaps it was due to the growing intolerance of  difficult behavior. No one wants to work with a grump. And with today’s forums and Reddit threads that leak information as it’s being unfolded, it’s become so easy to expose less-than-desirable behavior. But it’s become more complicated than that. It’s about branding now. I’ve written about this before, but I’ll write it again — in order to make opera more accessible, it needs to be marketable to today’s youth. Ingrain the interest in classical music in them now so they can carry it with them into adulthood. The best way to market is by frequenting the mediums millenials and Gen Z-ers use the most: social media.
When I say the divo or diva no longer exists, I mean it purely from a marketing standpoint. I’m sure many of these stars are real turds out of the rehearsal room. But that doesn’t seem to matter as long as they show up to their job with an agenda to work hard and collaborate cordially. The same goes for their public personas. The biggest difference between the early years of opera and now seems to be that there was no social media, so audiences took what they could get en masse. But now we can follow our favorite opera singers as they go about their daily lives, so we no longer want the big picture — we want the minute details. We want to see what they do on their days off. We want to see what kind of veggies they add to their weeknight stir-fry. We want to know what they’re watching on Netflix. And of course, we want their previews of the rehearsal room. Opera companies have always been smart, but there is a large difference between remaining what’s relevant and thinking ahead. That’s why Instagram and Twitter takeovers are so popular right now among these houses’ social media platforms.
How do we get the public to care about opera and its singers? Market it/them like celebrities or influencers.
It’s not in my nature to be overly optimistic, so I find it very sad that I’ve not only accepted this phenomenon but have also begun to endorse it. For so long I’ve attempted to maintain some semblance of the past, before social media dominated all aspects of our lives, when mystery was more prominent and preferred. But there isn’t any happenstance in the opera industry anymore. This could be true with just about any industry nowadays, but what criteria must the millennial diva follow today in order to be marketable? Every star has an angle. But agents and publicists aren’t necessarily looking for enhanced false personas anymore. They want stars to be “real,” or at least marketed as such.
Though the diva trope will never go away, you won’t see it a lot with today’s opera singers. We’ll have to refer back to de los Ángeles and Callas for a taste of what the industry used to be. That’s why I hold these recordings so close to my heart — they’re my only ticket to the golden age of opera.

Self-love. No matter how you describe it or what it means to you, there’s no doubt that it’s something that all of us should practice. In college, sometimes the days fly by so fast that before you know it, you’re halfway through the semester, stressed out, and are seriously considering dropping all your classes to move to New Zealand and become a sheep herder.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
So how do you practice self-love? Well, look where your mind goes when it wanders! If you’re in class and start to wonder how great that recipe in your Facebook newsfeed looked, go home and try it out. If you’re at the gym and you can’t stop thinking of Hot Cheetos, do yourself a favor and go buy yourself a bag. Self-love isn’t always about indulgence, though — sometimes it’s just about being kind to yourself. Eating healthier, exercising, and taking time out of your day to do something nice for yourself (even if it’s just painting your nails or watching that soccer game you’ve really wanted to catch). These things are enough to reset your mind, give you a little room to breathe and help you go back to work refreshed and recharged. 
Self-love can also mean taking a break from social media. Between keeping Snapchat streaks, posting on your finsta and tracking the likes on your Facebook profile picture, social media has become a measure of validation and a yardstick to measure how loved you are. Toxic Facebook friends, Instagram models with unattainable bodies and notifications that blow up your phone, often serve as a source of stress to most college students, even if we don’t realize it. Social media is inarguably a valuable tool that connects faraway friends and close ones too — and honestly, a good meme can make your day. However, too much of anything is poisonous, and this is especially true in today’s social media landscape.
It’s also important to realize that a large part of self-love is time management. As college students, we seldom realize how much we’re juggling. Between extracurriculars, midterms, calls from insistent parents and internships, it’s no wonder that burnout is the most common thing college counselors diagnose. Time management is an incredibly person-specific thing, so figure out what works for you. Whether you go analog with bullet journals, digital with Google Calendar or just carry around a to-do list, make sure you jot down the day’s most important tasks and allot yourself some time to relax if need be. 
In the end, self-love is something that begins and ends with you. Especially with how fast-paced life tends to be in college, it’s important to know that you deserve some time off (especially since you clicked on this article about giving yourself a break). College has the potential to be the best four years of your life, so make sure you’re doing your best to make it that way.

A Saturday POLITICO report found then-candidate Donald Trump performed significantly better in “news deserts” — counties in the U.S. with the lowest number of newspaper subscribers and active publications — than in counties with more newspaper subscriptions and active publications. The data revealed that Trump performed better than 2008 Republican candidate Mitt Romney and edged out 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in those specific areas. POLITICO drew its conclusions through a comparison of election results and subscription information from an industry media company, noting “a clear correlation between low subscription rates and Trump’s success.”
This analysis, if true, suggests that a decline in local news and the overall distrust in the industry can have a significant impact on national and even state elections. For someone like Trump — who often tends to exaggerate and stray from facts — it’s possible that the lack of local media coverage allowed him to appeal to voters directly rather than through third-party mediums that dilute his message and, obviously, fact-check his claims.
Admittedly, Trump is not the only politician who makes exaggerated claims and spins his platform to appeal to the American people. Many politicians, both Democratic and Republican, prolifically make statements that are factually untrue.
Therefore, it’s even more concerning that the quality and quantity of the local press has begun to dissolve, especially when misinformation and the threat of “fake news” run rampant on the internet. More than ever, the role of the local press in cultivating trust within smaller communities is needed, especially when national outlets are being verbally condemned and devalued by politicians. But instead, even in large cities like Los Angeles, newspapers are facing a decline while local TV stations across the U.S. (which are mostly owned by Sinclair Broadcasting Group) are being utilized as mouthpieces, pushing “must-run” packages directly produced by the company,  infringing on these stations’ independence.

In recent years, major newsrooms have experienced cutbacks on resources and reporters, as they invest in the growth of digital platforms and audience engagement methods. According to a 2014 report by the Washington Post, local news has, unfortunately, been hit the hardest. It’s obvious the business model of the news industry is changing; and now, the question many organizations are grappling with is: How do they catch up?
This is tricky, considering the overall lack of funding in newsrooms and the minimal resources allocated for journalists. On Twitter, following a streak of layoffs from the Denver Post, journalists retaliated against media company Tronc, the paper’s owners, and its executive leadership. Newspapers were once owned independently — not conglomerated into a media group spearheaded by business executives with their own monetary agendas.
At its core, journalism is a public service, and as an industry, it must reflect that. The problems and consequent decline faced by local press are multifaceted. First, the conglomeration of local media and disconnect between the newsroom and its owners make it unsurprising that local journalists are underpaid for their work and treated as replaceable by many media groups. Poor treatment and lack of resources have severely impacted not only the quality of reporting, but also the ability of the newsroom to digitize, and consequently monetize, its content to reach expanded audiences.
The increasing decline of the local press will ultimately play a role in future elections and in fostering political dialogue in smaller communities, as a whole. Major corporations like Google and Facebook are currently sponsoring journalism projects to support smaller newsrooms. But will that be enough? The responsibility to keep local news afloat lies not just in the hands of large media executives — any individual can make the decision to purchase a subscription from a local newspaper.

Social movements rise and fall on the backs of their leaders. For USC students taking part in the ongoing gun control movement, that might be grounds for pessimism.
There is evidence to suggest the current student-led gun control movement will not lead to significant policy change or the election of more anti-gun politicians because its leaders demonize the opposition and lack clear direction.
David Hogg, one of the #NeverAgain movement’s most vocal leaders, has repeatedly attacked the National Rifle Association and politicians who don’t adhere to his agenda. He’s referred to the NRA and the politicians it supports as “child murderers,” called NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch “disgusting” while accusing her of not caring about children’s lives, charged Senator Marco Rubio with trading campaign donations for students’ lives and claimed Florida Gov. Rick Scott “does not give a f-ck about [the Parkland] kids’ lives.”
This rhetoric is self-destructive. Since Hogg began his verbal assaults, Google searches for “NRA membership” have skyrocketed by 4,900 percent and donations to the NRA have tripled. TIME Magazine also reported large membership increases in the National Association for Gun Rights and other pro-Second Amendment groups.
At USC and college campuses nationwide, many students feel the need to hop on the political bandwagon and to participate in the recent wave of demands for gun control; and yet, like Hogg, they seem to lack focus. It’s easy to play the blame game, but it’s hard to turn that anger into action. If anything, the small turnout at the recent March for Our Lives event hosted by University student groups seemed to expose students’ apathy. 
On the national scale, the vitriolic approach of liberal activists has had the unintended effect of galvanizing the other side. The general trend of accusing the NRA of having blood on its hands mobilized many Second Amendment supporters in defense of their rights, demonstrating Americans’ willingness to stand up for organizations they feel represent them. This poses a major obstacle to the movement’s legislative agenda: Had the accusations and rhetoric not been so extreme, the responses likely would not have been either. Now groups like the NRA have more members and more funds, precisely because law-abiding gun owners believe they and their Second Amendment rights are under siege.
Additionally, one of the primary goals of the gun control movement is to vote out Second Amendment-supporting Republicans. At the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., Hogg told the crowd, “We’re going to make this the voting issue. We’re going to take this to every election, to every state and every city. To those politicians supported by the NRA that allow the continued slaughter of our children and our future, I say get your resumes ready.”
This seems to have had the opposite effect than what was intended.  A major shift in the generic congressional ballot polls occurred this past month. In February, Democrats led by 16 points. By the end of March, that lead shrank to six. When Republicans hear the demagoguery and read op-eds like former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens’ call to repeal the Second Amendment, they are motivated to turn out and protect their rights.
Here is where the student-led movement fails: Its leaders do not make affirmative cases with affirmative tactics. The March for Our Lives website lists five policies they wish to see enacted, yet the majority of their interviews and speeches give minimal arguments for why they would be effective. Instead, they spend their time on-screen lambasting politicians and the NRA.
The disconnect between their goals on paper and their goals in reality brings uncertainty to the movement and casts doubt on whether it can be successful. The Civil Rights movement had clear goals. The push for women’s suffrage did too. Those leaders clearly stated what they wanted and why they ought to get it but they never spoke the way Hogg and his supporters do. Anger is an effective mobilizer, but anger without hope is a destructive force.
Contrast this response with that of Hogg’s fellow Parkland survivor Kyle Kashuv. Kashuv has met with U.S. Senators from both parties and spoke with the president and first lady about finding middle ground. Kashuv was not invited to speak at the March for Our Lives with Hogg. He was not included on the cover of TIME Magazine like his peers. The media doesn’t want to talk to him and his peers don’t want to debate him. It’s no coincidence that Kashkuv is a conservative who supports the Second Amendment.
But Kashuv’s approach has worked. He didn’t yell. He didn’t make emotional appeals. He didn’t castigate politicians or the NRA. He didn’t demonize those who opposed him. Equipped with facts, he went to Washington and lobbied for the STOP School Violence Act, which passed the House 407-10 and is currently in the Senate. He had a clear direction.
Students everywhere, including here at USC, have the choice of which model to follow. Movements can be reformed, and if this one wants any chance at success, it has to be.

There is no bigger name in hip-hop right now than Cardi B. It’s hard to believe now that critics once doubted her longevity in the industry after her Grammy-nominated hit “Bodak Yellow” was released last summer. But in her sizzling debut album, Invasion of Privacy, Cardi puts any doubts about her career to rest. Following in the footsteps of “Bodak Yellow,” her lyrics are raw, clever and humorous; her stances are often bold and her voice is always fresh. 
Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records.
Her distinctive voice — resulting from her South Bronx upbringing — paired with her clever lyrics, make Invasion of Privacy a breath of fresh air, especially in an industry that can be so controlling and restrictive. Cardi avoids these shackles on her debut album, while still making it an early standout among the hip-hop releases so far in 2018. 
The album is 13 tracks, which gives it just enough time to not overstay its welcome. And it doesn’t, as the album gets straight to the point. 
Invasion of Privacy is a solid album, with no filler tracks clogging the tracklist. Each individual song could carry its own weight as a single. The intro song, “Get Up 10,” is a fiery anthem of empowerment, as she recounts her rise to the top and the days before her music career when she was working as a stripper across the street from her school. In the chorus, she looks herself in the mirror and says, “Man I said we gon’ win/Knock me down nine times but I get up 10.” On this song, as well as the rest of the album, her delivery is always on point, and rarely does she let the production overtake her.
The track “I Like It” is delivered half in English and half in Spanish, Cardi’s first language. She brought along Latin trap singer Bad Bunny and Colombian reggaeton artist J Balvin to lend their talents as well. The song will sound familiar to listeners because it samples the famous ’60s boogaloo track “I Like It Like That” by Peter Rodriguez.
The album is full of star-studded cameos, rendering Invasion of Privacy truly impressive for a debut album. Chance The Rapper makes an appearance on the song “Best Life,” a catchy tune that carefully blends Cardi’s signature aggressiveness with the fresh style Chance pioneered on Coloring Book. SZA raps both the intro and chorus on the song “I Do:” “Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket/Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine/No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like,” their voices melding together and harmonizing perfectly. Other cameos include hip-hop trio Migos, rapper 21 Savage and R&B singer Kehlani. 
Less than a week after its release, Invasion of Privacy has already gone gold due to the success of prior singles, and the full project does not disappoint. As long as Cardi B stays true to herself and keeps the beats fresh, then it is safe to assume that Invasion of Privacy is only the start of what is sure to be a long, successful career with plenty of more gold to come.

Unlike his previous directorial efforts, John Krasinski is topping charts with his new horror film, A Quiet Place. The thriller, which came out last Friday, grabbed the top spot in this weekend’s box office results, pushing out Steven Spielberg’s new Ready Player One in the process. Krasinski and his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, play the father and mother in the Abbott family, living in a post-apocalyptic world in which humans are hunted by alien-like creatures. These monsters rely on sound to navigate and hunt for their prey, forcing the family to scavenge for supplies, communicate soundlessly and live in complete silence in order to survive. 
Real-life couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt play Lee and Evelyn Abbott, respectively. Photo from IMDB.
The inventive premise of the film brings a fresh take to the horror genre, a change that has been sorely needed in recent years. The hook — that making noise will result in immediate danger — made for an extremely thrilling film. By carefully playing with the sound design within the movie, Krasinski created a world of constant suspense in which one wrong step could cause characters to fear for their lives. Particularly impressive was Krasinski’s choice to include a hearing-impaired actress, Millicent Simmonds, to play his daughter. This creates an environment in which the audience constantly knows more about the present dangers than one of the characters. 
Although the premise is well-executed at face value, it is not without its faults. Krasinski, an actor known for his ability to communicate subtly but effectively with his facial expressions, was a perfect fit for his role as Lee Abbott. He convincingly conveyed and expressed the hard-hitting emotions of love and loss all while remaining completely silent. Here, he takes on a drastically different role than his best-known portrayal of Jim Halpert from NBC’s wildly popular The Office, and the risk paid off. Few actors can move beyond their most iconic roles as well as Krasinski can; he merged with the character well, leaving no semblance of the goofy and lovable office prankster Halpert through the courage and ruggedness of his performance in A Quiet Place.
Emily Blunt was fantastic as Evelyn Abbott, the pregnant mother of the family. Blunt arguably plays the strongest character in the film. Expecting to bring a child into the hectic and dangerous world, she must deal with the struggles and pains of pregnancy all while remaining completely silent. In one intense scene, Blunt must deliver her child without making any sound whatsoever. A mother in real life, Blunt did not lack the experience needed to play such a compassionate and strong woman.
The movie’s embrace of cliche horror tropes was frustrating, especially given the other original elements within the movie. On top of the shocking instances of on-screen gore in the movie, the suspense the movie provided was riddled with uninspired jump scares. 
The score under the suspenseful scenes was not particularly interesting and somewhat predictable. At times, Krasinski used the music essentially to tell the audience “feel suspense here” and “jump here.” The loud and at times jarring score detracted from the suspense and tension fueled by the silence in the movie. Overall, these tropes were an unfortunate stain on what was ostensibly an original horror movie. 
Ultimately, Krasinski’s horror debut was a fantastic success. The premise was intriguing enough to pull $50 million in ticket sales its opening weekend. Krasinski’s impressive casting made for a sincere family unit marked by compassion, authenticity and relatable conflict in family dynamics. The multidimensional characters drove the plot forward and outshined problems within the movie. Krasinski’s A Quiet Place will certainly be a horror movie that inspires how other directors create drama and characters within the genre.

HBO Film President Len Amato and Slate PR co-founder Simon Halls spoke at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Monday night. At the talk, Amato and Halls discussed the importance of public relations and film when dealing with modern issues in the Hollywood industry.

The discussion was moderated by professor Mary Murphy and was part of her class, “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
Amato and Halls talked about their decisions to enter the media industry despite the struggles and successes they experienced. 
“I went to junior college because I thought I would be drafted into the Vietnam War,” Amato said. “But I got a high lottery number, so I enrolled in Columbia College and wrote two movies.”
While working, he said he learned that the entertainment industry does not produce movies that cater to everybody. Rather, he said that the industry expands on issues and serves audiences who care about the messages and themes that come across in the movies.
Murphy shared trailers for some of the films Amato oversaw in the past year. One trailer was for Paterno, a film centered on former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and the accusations that he failed to report an assistant coach at the school for engaging in pedophilia. 
Amato said that HBO Film received backlash for making the film, but Amato said he believed it was important to cover the issue of sexual assault, especially in light of the #MeToo movement.
At the event, Halls also shared different tips about the workings of the media industry and how journalists can lead technological shifts in media.
“I think Simon Halls’ success and the fact he started the biggest PR company was important,” said Shannon Ward, a junior majoring in public relations who attended the talk. “I also think what was Simon was saying about just getting in the door of the media industry was important.”

Days after losing her parents, Xia Shuqin and her sister were found standing in the rubble of their house by an American missionary, who was taking a picture of the scene. In the present, the Nanjing Massacre survivor is sharing her experiences with her grandchildren to carry on her family’s history. 
While creating the documentary, the film team spent several days walking through China with Xia Shuqin and her grandchildren as Shuqin remembered various places from her childhood. Photo from Tribeca Film.
The Girl and the Picture follows the life of Xia after the events of the Nanjing Massacre. The documentary, produced by the USC Shoah Foundation, will be shown at Tribeca Film Festival on April 27. 
“Sometimes it’s hard to understand history without identifying information about people and actual lives,” said Vanessa Roth, the film’s director. “One really powerful way to understand history is to understand [that it] is family history.”
The USC Shoah Foundation has maintained an ongoing partnership with the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders with the intention of collecting the survivors’ testimonies, making them interactive and bringing them to a larger audience. 
One of the foundation’s interviewees was Xia, whose own experiences utilizing activism to raise awareness about the massacre appealed to the foundation. Foundation members conducted a closer examination into Xia’s story.
“When we brought her to Los Angeles to interview her as part of our interactive testimony, we became more in touch with her story and her experience and this part of that became also her interest in telling the story to her own family,” said Karen Jungblut, director of research and documentation at the Shoah Foundation. 
According to Jungblut, this initial interest quickly formed an idea for a full-length documentary. Throughout the documentary’s developmental stages, staff members interested in the project focused on the familial bonds and legacy Xia’s wanted to create by sharing her story. 
“[Nanjing survivor] Madame Xia has been interviewed about the massacre for many years now by many journalists around the world,” Roth said, “We wanted to make a film that was a personal story.” 
The film team spent days filming Xia and her grandchildren walking through the places in China she knew as a child and looking through photographs from her past, before and after the massacre. 
“Family members get answers that are personal,” Roth said. “A young child would ask questions about childhood and bring her back to her own childhood.”
Now, with the chance for added exposure through the Tribeca Film Festival, Roth said The Girl and the Picture can spread its lessons to a wider audience.
“Tribeca is one of the most important film festivals globally,” said Andi Gitow, the film’s executive producer, who is also the director of strategy, partnerships and media production at the Foundation. “It’s not even just about the screening itself that takes place, but the discussions around the screening, the press coverage, the fact that [it] allows Madame Xia’s message and USC Shoah’s message to get out even more.”
The film has been submitted to a number of other festivals, including the Newport Beach Film Festival. There are plans to screen the film in China and distribute it through a theatrical release to spread its message worldwide.
“It’s this idea of the legacy across generations,” Gitow said. “It’s a legacy of loss, a legacy of resilience, it’s a legacy of family and it’s a legacy of forgiveness. I think the notion is that everyone has stories to tell and it’s important that people share their stories with their own families.”
Meanwhile, the foundation has continued to collect 100 other testimonies to be subtitled in English and integrated into the archive by the end of the year. Jungblut said that by bringing in these interviews, more light will be shed on a fragment of history that has not previously received as much attention.
“To really understand the global impact of a World War and a war that really happened on different continents and the impact that this history has … from that perspective, I think it’s important to us to bring these stories into the archive with the Holocaust survivor testimonies and other testimonies from other genocides,” Jungblut said.

The Sinclair Broadcast Group required news anchors at its broadcasting stations to read a company statement on-air accusing other news outlets of publishing “fake news.” Photo from Sinclair Broadcast Group
Thirteen university deans and department chairs from journalism schools across the country, including USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, signed an open letter to the Sinclair Broadcast Group Friday protesting Sinclair requiring news anchors at nearly 200 broadcasting stations to read a statement written by the company on-air. The statement accused other news outlets of publishing “fake news.” 
“The educators say requiring the anchors to read the company’s statement violates a tenant of the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics which is to ‘Act Independently,’” a Poynter article reported on April 6. 
“Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think,” the statement Sinclair wrote said, which was read on-air by dozens of news anchors last month. 
Gordon Stables, the USC Annenberg School of Journalism interim director, said that the University of Maryland shared a draft of the letter that they were planning to send to Sinclair and asked USC if they would like to co-sign it. 
“Sinclair’s use of news personnel to deliver commentary — not identified as such — may further erode what has traditionally been one of the strongest allegiances in the news landscape, the trust that viewers put in their local television stations,” the letter, addressed to Sinclair Executive Chairman David Smith, read. 
Along with USC, heads of journalism schools at the University of Maryland, Syracuse University, Louisiana State University, University of Georgia, University of Mississippi, Temple University, Ohio University, University of Arizona, UC Berkeley, University of Illinois, The George Washington University and Morgan State University signed the letter. 
“We reached out to our faculty by email on Friday afternoon and evening and had a substantial and overwhelming response of the faculty strongly supporting us adding our signature to the letter,” Stables said.
Sinclair Broadcast Group operates or owns 193 broadcasting stations across the country, and is the nation’s largest broadcaster. According to The New York Times, the company regularly sends out “must-runs” to the local news stations that they operate, which are video segments with content such as terrorism news updates, commentary and more. 
Stables said Sinclair is crossing a line when it comes to ethical reporting.
“As a school that focuses on teaching journalism as a career and profession, there are some important professional norms,” Stables said. “One of them that you should not breach is the difference between reporting and commentary or opinion pieces and news coverage. And I think the Sinclair broadcasting decision to blur that line is really disturbing.”
Scott Livingston, Sinclair’s vice president for news, issued a response to Poynter regarding the letter addressed by journalism educators. 
“We stand for accurate reporting first and foremost,” he said in a statement. “We understand that the promo prompted an emotional response, and we’ll learn from that in the future.” 
Sinclair has received criticism for the company’s most recent live must-read, mostly due to its eerily similar rhetoric to President Donald Trump’s censure of the American press, and the Trump administration’s refusal to condemn Sinclair. 
“So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased,” Trump tweeted in defense of Sinclair on April 2.

In a key face-off at home Saturday, the women’s water polo team fended off Cal with an 11-6 victory, holding off the Bears in a chippy rivalry game. With a win, the Bears could have won the MPSF conference with the program’s first-ever 5-0 sweep. Instead, the Trojans rose to the pressure and handled Cal in a dominant performance on both sides of the ball.

Cal started the game on the attack, punching the Trojans in the mouth with an early goal. Senior captain driver Brianna Daboub volleyed a shot into the net to tie the game up briefly, but the Bears responded quickly and held onto the 2-1 lead for the rest of the period. 
Play in the opening period was intense, forcing the refs to whistle for minor penalties every few seconds. But as the Trojans entered the second period, they began to adapt to the Bears’ physical style of play, using penalties to their advantage and responding with equal force.
The second period saw a shift in momentum, as the Trojans began to take over in the center position. Daboub battled again for the ball down low, turning over her shoulder and forcing a shot home to tie up the game at 2-2. From there, the Trojans never trailed behind again. 
Senior utility Annika Jensen softly touched in a shot on a 6-on-6 power play, and the lights flickered on over the pool as the Trojans took the lead. A counter-attack goal from sophomore utility Maud Megens stretched the lead to 4-2, and although the Bears responded with a late goal, the Trojans carried a lead and the momentum into halftime.
“We knew it was going to be a physical, aggressive game when we came into it,” Megens said. “I think we just took some time to adjust and get comfortable, and then we were able to come together and really play our game.”
Junior goalkeeper Amanda Longan clinched the victory with a dominant performance in goal, making 15 saves and shutting out Cal in the fourth quarter. Despite the Bears’ ability to score early in the game, Longan smothered the team’s attack in the second half, gaining confidence with a series of fearsome, one-handed blocks.
In the third period, Longan swam several feet off her line to overtake a center with a wide-open lane to the goal, shocking the attacker into turning the ball over. The gutsy play earned a chorus of gasps, followed by a raucous cheer, from USC supporters. 
If Longan had miscalculated and the center had passed the ball on, the risk would have been disastrous, leaving the empty net gaping and defenseless. But it paid off, bolstering the team’s confidence and setting up the Trojan defense for a lights-out final period.
“There’s a slim chance that works,” Longan said of the play. “I’m not really sure why I decided to go, but I just read the situation and I thought I could get there on time. In an instant, I just took a shot and did it.”
With the defense locked down, the USC offense began to fire up. Both Megens and Jensen notched hat tricks in the second half, and while Cal was able to find the net twice in the third period, it wasn’t enough to keep up. On a 6-on-5 exclusion play at the end of the period, Megens slotted her third goal, pushing the lead to 8-6. The Cal bench was furious, and head coach Coralie Simmons earned a yellow card after slamming a cone into the concrete of the pool deck.
The Trojans controlled the final period with ease, with Jensen notching 2 more goals to add cushion to the Trojans’ lead. With time expiring, Longan held the ball to draw out the clock, only passing with a couple of seconds left on the shot clock. But everything seemed to be going right for the Trojans as Megens lofted a ball easily over the keeper, giving the Trojans an 11-6 lead with a minute left.
As the final buzzer sounded, relief filled the team. With the win, the Trojans improved to 2-0 in MPSF play, holding off the Bears’ attempt at winning the outright conference title. Cal has now dropped to 4-1 in conference play, and without anymore scheduled MSPF games, the Bears will have to wait to see the fate of the conference title.
For USC, however, the hard work has just begun. Over the next three weekends, the Trojans will face No. 1 Stanford, No. 4 UCLA and No. 19 San José State, opening up an opportunity to stamp out another conference title victory. The greatest challenge will be the team’s matchup with the Cardinal on Friday, giving them a chance to knock off the top-ranked team in the nation and stake a claim on the top seed entering the MPSF and NCAA championship tournaments.
“We have a lot of confidence out of this game,” Megens said. “Our team is capable of so many things. If we have a straight line forward, we can get anyone.”

Over the weekend, USC women’s lacrosse dropped to 7-7 on the season (5-4 conference record) after suffering a pair of losses. The team traveled to snowy Boulder, Col., Friday, where they lost 10-7 to the Buffaloes despite a strong team performance which included a 4-goal game for sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller. Following their loss, the team traveled to Oregon, where they faced defeat once again, this time to the Ducks by a score of 11-18. 
In her first season donning cardinal and gold, graduate attacker Maeve McMahon has netted 14 goals in 14 games. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
After losing against Stanford last week, the Women of Troy were determined to bring their A-game against the Buffaloes. The game had its fair share of ups and downs. The Buffs came out of the gate to make a statement early, scoring 4 goals in the first 13 minutes and leaving the Trojans scoreless.     
The first half continued to be all about the Buffaloes, as they rolled into halftime with a comfortable 7-1 lead. USC started the second half dominantly as Miller and sophomore midfielder Kaeli Huff, who had 2 goals of her own on Friday, led the team on a 4-0 run as the game closed in on its 15-minute mark.
Colorado senior attacker Darby Kiernan, who was a force throughout Friday’s game with 5 goals, ended USC’s scoring run with 2 of Colorado’s next 3 goals to give the Buffaloes a more sizeable lead of 10-5.
With one more goal by Miller — her fourth — and a late goal by freshman midfielder Sophia Donovan with under a minute left, the final score was sealed at 10-7 in favor of Colorado.
Despite the loss, Miller posted her fourth hat trick this season. She is the seventh Trojan to record 10 career hat tricks, and she has achieved this by her sophomore season.
The loss ended USC’s five-game winning streak against the Buffaloes, a team they defeated last year, 11-5.
After their defeat in Colorado, the team traveled north to Eugene, Ore., to face the Ducks with hopes of bouncing back. Earlier in the season, the Trojans defeated the Ducks in overtime by a final score of 9-8. 
However, this matchup would tell a different story as the Trojan powerhouse was crushed by a score of 11-18. 
Unlike the start of the game against Colorado, USC drew the first blood against Oregon. The 1-0 lead would not last long as the Ducks dominated the field and went on a 10-0 scoring run, leaving the Trojans scoreless for 15 minutes.
With the end of the first half quickly approaching, freshman midfielder Kelsey Huff and junior midfielder Emily Concialdi snapped the Trojans out of their drought and scored a goal each. Their efforts put the Trojans at 10-3 at the start of the second half. Huff continued to prove herself in this game by scoring her fourth hat trick of the season to tie for the team lead of four this season. 
In the second half, Oregon came out and secured the running clock against USC with a 4-0 run. As the Trojans struggled to catch up, they responded with a 6-0 run to trim the lead to 14-9. 
Despite the efforts made by the Trojans, the Ducks ultimately solidified the win (18-11) over the Women of Troy when Oregon’s senior midfielder Jojo Hesketh scored her fourth goal of the day. 
Undoubtedly, the Ducks proved themselves to be a force to be reckoned with. 
Oregon’s strong roster consisted of four of their players scoring hat tricks led by 5 goals scored by Hesketh, 4 goals by senior attacker Mariah Gatti and 3 apiece from senior midfielder Natalie Modly and senior attacker Jill Zubillaga. 
For the Trojans, senior defense Lydia Sutton had two ground balls. Midfielder Kerrigan Miller had three ground balls and two caused turnovers. Lastly, sophomore defense Morgan Kuligowski had one ground ball and caused two turnovers.
Senior goalkeeper Gussie Johns’ strong defense continued to be a strong asset for the Women of Troy despite the back-to-back losses. Over the weekend, she added 17 saves and eight ground balls to her count for the 2018 season. 
The Women of Troy return to McAlister Field still ranked No. 17 on the season and are looking to snap their three-game losing streak as they welcome former MPSF foe San Diego State this Friday. The match will be the final home game for the spring season and will include a pregame Senior Day festivity, where the Trojans will celebrate seniors Johns, Lydia Sutton and Alexis Kardias.

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
This week’s edition of Peter King’s Monday Morning Quarterback was headlined by a bold prediction: “This is going to be the most talked-about [NFL] draft in history.” That quote came from Gil Brandt, the Dallas Cowboys’ former vice president and the NFL’s current go-to draft guru. If anyone can make an accurate gambit on the future of the league, Brandt, who spent three decades with the Cowboys, would be your man. Yet somehow, the prediction of a life-changing, league-altering draft seems almost too good to be true.
There are only two weeks left until this year’s NFL Draft is underway in Texas. But is Dallas really capable of changing all that much? After all, those three days of lottery picks could be described as the most overhyped event of every year of pro football. The same storyline seems to play out on an annual basis. A few prayers for Cleveland, a few misty-eyed moments over touching stories of players who overcame adversity, and then the smoke settles and the real work begins. 
I’m not saying that the draft isn’t important. The players selected over those three days set the tone and the foundation of the future of every team in the league. But the draft is a bit of a shot in the dark. For the past year, scouts at every team have been doing their best to predict the future value of a player, and that isn’t an exact science.
Every football fan knows this story. Todd Marinovich was picked before Brett Favre. Tom Brady went 199th overall. All too often, the greatest stars are overlooked or ignored in the draft, and those who go in the first round end up peaking in college.
Even former Trojans have seen this play out. Former USC receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, for instance, was a second-round pick last year, then burst onto the scene with the Steelers to become a household name in Pittsburgh and around the NFL. Smith-Schuster ended up posting better stats and making a bigger impact on his team than other first-round picks, such as Corey Davis and Mike Williams, were able to at their respective teams.
The draft process is ultimately unpredictable, a series of well-researched guesses that sometimes pan out and sometimes crash and burn. So why might this draft be the one that changes everything? Perhaps because it’s stacked with an unbelievably expansive lineup of dependable future stars.
We’ll get to the quarterbacks, but first, when talking about this draft, you have to talk about Saquon Barkley. The former Nittany Lion has every tool in his belt to become an All-Pro player in a handful of years. He’s powerful, he’s explosive and when he has the ball, it’s impossible to tear your eyes away from him. If you watched Barkley play a single snap last season, you know that any team can depend on him to shoulder the run game of an offense, even as a rookie. 
In any given year, Barkley would probably go in the top four. But not this year. And that’s because of the quarterback class, a group of five young players who each have the potential to become something special.
A lot of scouts, analysts and fans have argued that this class isn’t all that special because of the obvious question marks surrounding each quarterback. Josh Allen has the arm, but not the accuracy. Sam Darnold has the go-get-it attitude and the natural vision, but he tosses too many interceptions. Josh Rosen talks too much; Lamar Jackson runs too often; Baker Mayfield is, well, Baker Mayfield.
But in my opinion, the focus of these criticisms proves the difference between this quarterback class and those of the past. Many of the critiques brought up for each of these quarterbacks define how the young player might not become a star. But I think it’s hard to argue that each of these five athletes will become consistent, dependable starters. And at least a few of them will grow to become stars.
This is how this year’s draft could change everything. As the day nears, many experts are predicting that the first five picks could easily be quarterbacks, with Rosen and Darnold expected to take the first and second slots. This means that the frontrunners of five teams could be completely different next year. Even more importantly, it means that five teams could have veritable superstars in the making running the show next season.
If anyone needs proof of how quickly a young quarterback can make a difference, they only have to look east to Philadelphia, which is still basking in the glow of the Super Bowl victory that Carson Wentz set up in his sophomore season. The Eagles traded up to clinch Wentz in the 2016 Draft, and after an impressive showing as a rookie, he went on to lay the foundation for the dangerous Philly offense that overthrew Brady this season.
The coming-of-age season for Wentz was only the beginning of a shift that is soon to develop throughout the NFL, with Patrick Mahomes taking over the reins in Kansas City and Deshaun Watson returning to full health in Houston. The addition of five new quarterbacks with the potential to make similarly big splashes in their rookie seasons means that this is going to be an explosive year of football to watch.
This year, the NFL has a major shakeup in the works. Fans across the league better strap in and prepare for the ride.
