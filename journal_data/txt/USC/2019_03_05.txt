Thirty minutes after practice ends for the men’s basketball team, an impromptu dunk contest has a group of visiting elementary school students in an exuberant state. With every gravity-defying between-the-legs dunk attempt by senior guard Devin Fleming and every unexpected 360-degree dunk by sophomore forward Victor Uyaelunmo, the excitement increases for everyone at Galen Center’s practice courts. 
Everyone except for junior forward Nick Rakocevic. 
“[Nick] is always trying to get in the gym,” junior guard Jonah Mathews said. “He’s a workaholic.”
Two days after a 10-point outing in a loss to Utah in February, Rakocevic works silently on the other end of the court. As he alternates between 15-foot catch-and-shoot jumpers and free throws, his post-practice workout is camouflaged to the eyes and phones that are glued to every dunk on the other end of the court. 
It is this level of dedication that has Rakocevic, the Pac-12’s 11th-leading scorer, in the middle of a breakout junior campaign for USC and on his way to receiving all-conference honors. 
“If he keeps working, improving and getting better, there is no limit to what he could do,” said Gene Pignatore, Rakocevic’s coach at Saint Joseph’s High School.
Growing from a high school player who Pingatore described as “a piece of work” into one of the best players in the Pac-12 is a testament to the work ethic that the big man has followed since his days at Saint Joseph’s High in Westchester, Ill.
“Back in high school, when the older guys left, I knew I would have a new, bigger role I had to take on,” Rakocevic said.  
During his senior season of high school, Rakocevic was the only returning starter for Pignatore and still managed to carry his team — averaging 19.8 points, 14.4 rebounds and 4.0 blocks — to a top-four finish in the state tournament. When asked to pinpoint what motivates Rakocevic to step up to the plate, Pignatore honed in on the qualities that he noticed from the moment they met.
“He always had that chip on his shoulder and knew how good he wanted to be,” Pignatore said. “He worked his butt off to get there.” 
Rakocevic’s first two seasons at USC were spent as a role player, but this season, he was tasked with filling the shoes of Chimezie Metu, who was drafted by the San Antonio Spurs over the summer. Prior to his junior year, Rakocevic had scored over 20 points in a game just once.
“I knew I would have this opportunity when Chimezie left,” Rakocevic said. “I just had to work on my game and be ready.”
Thirteen double-doubles and five 20-point, 10-rebound games later, it’s safe to say Rakocevic was ready to take on the extra responsibility. In fact, the breakout star may be ready for more. Rakocevic is the only player in the Pac-12 to be in the top 11 in points, rebounds and blocks — a feat he shares only with 2018 first overall pick DeAndre Ayton and 2016 first round pick Jakob Poeltl since the 2008-09 season. 
“There are a lot of other very talented bigs, but I’m just going to keep working,” Rakocevic said. “If the Pac-12 sees me as the best big, then I’m blessed to be that, and I would have to give a lot of the credit to my teammates. It’s fun playing with them. The game comes easy when it’s fun playing with your teammates.”
From operating high-low dump downs with senior forward Bennie Boatwright to finishing off pick-and-rolls with redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton, Rakocevic has been the target for some of the Trojans’ best offensive looks all season, and he’s working to add even more to his already dependable bag of scoring tactics.
“He keeps working every game to get to the next level, and I’m looking forward to that,” Mathews said. 
Rakocevic compares his style of play of hustling and finishing around the rim to the high motor and energy that Chris “Birdman” Andersen used to bring in the NBA, but he can see a future where he adds a few elements of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic’s game into his arsenal.
“I’m trying to work on my game in the summer, so hopefully I can add that jump shot,” Rakocevic said. “And I like passing, so I’m trying to mimic my game to add some of his flashy passes.”
Although the added elements of a Jokic package seem to be a summer of training away, Rakocevic’s development has become noticeable. One particular highlight, a fastbreak behind-the-back pass to Thornton against Utah that took everyone by surprise sparked a slight smile from Rakocevic, and in the crucial moments of the game against Stanford, he pulled off an underhanded post shot identical to the one that earned Jokic the nickname “Joker” in Denver.   
Rakocevic’s consistent numbers, matched with the intensity he routinely brings to the floor, has earned the forward his fair share of nicknames. Rakocevic likes them all, but one nickname given to him by teammates during his freshman season has become a staple of his mentality: Big Dawg.
“‘Big Dawg’ has been like my alter-ego when I get out there on the court,” Rakocevic said. 
The confidence behind the nickname is evident every time Rakocevic goes into the painted area. He assertively demands the ball, whether it is against UCLA’s 7-foot-1 Moses Brown or Arizona State’s 6-foot-8 Romello Brown.
Since entering USC, Rakocevic has developed from a scrappy pup to the Big Dawg of the Pac-12 and, according to his former coach, his growth is far from over.
“He [will] fit in wherever he plays, whether it’s overseas or the NBA,” Pignatore said.

One time, someone told me that I have the same literary taste as a   25-year-old white boy.  
Granted, this was back during my David Foster Wallace phase. But the pronouncement still rattled me, and I resolved right then and there to read more works by young women of color, especially Asian Americans. 
But that’s not why I picked up “Severance,” even though the author, Ling Ma, fits the above criteria. I picked up “Severance” because it was topping every end-of-year “Best 2018 Book Releases” list, garnering rave reviews from all the prestigious publications — The New York Times, New Yorker, Vulture, Paris Review. It even popped up in aesthetic Instagram flat lay photos, with its trendy Glossier-pink cover.
After I finished the book, I realized what I had been missing out on. Because I have never, ever related to a fictional character more than I related to Candace Chen, the protagonist of “Severance.” 
“Severance” is billed as a satirical horror novel with alternating chapters set in B.A. and A.A.: Before Apocalypse and After Apocalypse. The A.A. chapters detail Candace’s attempts to eke out a life with a roving band of survivors, all of whom are mysteriously impervious to the airborne Shen Fever, as they try to make their way to a secure compound called The Facility. The B.A. chapters illustrate Candace’s aggressively humdrum life and upbringing before the worldwide epidemic hits. In the book, Shen Fever originates in Shenzhen, China, and its zombified victims, although unpossessing of a hankering for human flesh, are doomed to an arguably worse fate: They are condemned to continually reenact a common life routine until they die from starvation and decay. In a particularly terrifying encounter, Candace stumbles upon a little girl flipping mechanically through the pages of a book, periodically sipping from a glass of moldy orange juice. 
It was eerie, reading the B.A. chapters about Candace’s upbringing and temperament, and realizing how similar we were. She grew up an only child, worked hard in school to make her Chinese immigrant parents proud. She relocates to New York after college, a move I’m also banking on. She is wistful for the illusion of New York more than for its reality. She likes taking long, solitary walks through the city, snapping photos that she uploads to her photo blog, New York Ghost. She doesn’t mind being alone. In fact, most of the time, she prefers it. Anonymity, as she says, is freedom. 
Her job is in production at a book publishing corporation called Spectra. She’s assigned to the Bibles department but secretly wishes to be one of the girls who works in the Art department: long-legged, shiny-haired fixtures who attend museum and gallery openings. She wants to be an Art Girl — well, who wouldn’t?
Soon after she lands the job, Candace is sent to Shenzhen to observe the manufacturing plants that produce the Bibles. The trip serves a dual purpose: To cast a foreboding shadow over the rote, repetitive movements performed by the factory workers and to highlight Candace losing touch with her Chinese heritage. She doesn’t know the full names of any of her relatives in China, and she barely communicates with them. She doesn’t really celebrate Lunar New Year, except by eating moon cakes. A character tells Candace that her Chinese name reminds him of a famous poem by Li Bai, “Quiet Night Thought.” It is a poem taught to every Chinese kindergartener, one that I used to recite over and over. But Candace doesn’t recognize it, and neither did I, until I looked it up and memories of it came flooding back. 
After Shen Fever spreads overseas and ravages most of New York, Candace is offered an eye-popping sum to stay and man the ship, long after everyone else at Spectra has either succumbed or fled home to be with their families. Turning the amount over in her mind, she imagines “Crème de la Mer moisturizing creams, Fendi handbags and Bottega Veneta sandals.” She accepts — she’s ambitious, and has a taste for the finer things in life, even after social signifiers of class and status have been rendered moot by mass devastation. 
With “Severance,” Ling Ma proves it’s possible to write a novel that fuses one’s own lived experience with the fantastical and absurd and find an audience far beyond your own community. I’ve read so many books from perspectives that are my polar opposite — it’s perhaps telling that I haven’t read something that resonated as deeply with me as “Severance” for a long time.
The book had one more surprise for me: After I finished, I flipped to the back and was struck by Ling Ma’s author portrait. She looks just like my mom. Actually, the resemblance is  uncanny. Something about the eyes, the eyebrows, the freckles dotting their faces. It was as if she’d already known me my whole life — which, in a way, maybe she did.

Anyone in the audience at Tommy’s Place for the six-hour Trojan Dance Marathon last Friday would have seen Event Operations Chair Judy Clayton running around in a squirrel costume and Song Girl skirt. They would have seen the entire room joining in on a high-intensity Bollywood workout dance. They would have seen past patients at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles as young as two years old jumping into dance circles. They would have seen Asher Hatch, one of the many Miracle Children who took the stage, chasing his dad around in a 10-foot inflatable dinosaur costume and telling jokes. 
This kind of exuberance was typical of the event. It was jam-packed with upbeat music, performances by the UnderSCore a cappella group and complementary cereal and donut bar. Attendees could even donate money to send a friend to “jail,” who then had to raise twice as much money  to get bailed. 
Trojan Dance Marathon was one of five such events held across the country on March 1, and USC was one of 400 colleges and high schools to host the event. These marathons typically range from six to 40 hours long and benefit hundreds of pediatric hospitals nationwide. The Children’s Miracle Network has raised over $250 million through Dance Marathon programs since 1991, and the annual total is steadily increasing each year.
After a one-year hiatus, organizers of the Trojan Dance Marathon exceeded their own expectations and raised more than $31,000 from 311 participants on 29 teams. Proceeds will benefit Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. 
The primary motto of the Miracle Network Dance Marathon, repeated throughout the night, was “For The Kids.” Sara Atun, dancer relations chair of Trojan Dance Marathon, even instructed the audience to “dab for the kids” while teaching a dance. 
“We all just really cared about the whole premise like ‘For The Kids,’ and everything you’re doing is for these children,” said Rebecca Breitstein, executive director of Trojan Dance Marathon a junior majoring in business administration and Spanish. 
CHLA, a Miracle Network Hospital, is one of the only “safety-net” pediatric facilities in the country, which means it provides care to those who need it regardless of financial ability. 
 It’s just a fun event, and you’re doing it all for a great cause,” said Jack Warnecke, a freshman majoring in journalism who served as a member of the marathon’s social media committee. “I don’t really know what about it couldn’t be fun.”
The night also had moments that were deeply personal, as the Miracle Children and their families shared their stories of how CHLA went above and beyond in providing care for them. 
“A lot of things that people like to talk about with CHLA is how it doesn’t feel like a hospital, and that’s true, it really doesn’t,” said Allen Alvarado, one of the Miracle Children. “It’s one thing to have people working on you. It’s a completely different thing to have people working with you and making you see the strength inside yourself, which is what every nurse, every doctor, every employee of Children’s Hospital did.”
This sentiment was echoed by nearly every speaker who took the stage. Senior football long snapper Jake Olson spoke about his experiences at CHLA, where he was treated on and off for 12 years.  
Breitstein was one of three students responsible for bringing Trojan Dance Marathon back to USC’s campus, along with Hallie Arena and Kristian Chun. After celebrating its 10th annual marathon in Spring 2017, CHLA staff and advisors discontinued the event because of low both fundraising and participation. 
“It wasn’t quite the force that it is on other campuses,” said Trojan Dance Marathon Advisor Emma Standring-Trueblood. 
Breitstein, Chun and Arena, however, were not ready to give up on the marathon. 
“We just sat there one day and looked at each other and said, ‘We really miss Dance Marathon,’” Breitstein said. 
After making the suggestion to CHLA, the three were tasked with writing a comprehensive business plan to prove they were committed to bringing Trojan Dance Marathon back to USC’s campus and making it a successful event. 
“They are three amazing young women that had a vision, and they proved that vision to us,” Standring-Trueblood said. “This comes from their minds, this comes from them and the team that they have built, all the work everyone has put in and the leadership of those three.” 
In addition to the dancing and fundraising, the success of this event proved to Breitstein and her fellow executive board members that the Trojan Dance Marathon can become a sustainable tradition on USC’s campus. 
“Long term, I would love to see over $100,00 raised a year,” Breitstein said. “I think that we have the student body possible and generally speaking, enough affluence and resources to be able to find ways to generate that much in donations every year.”

I don’t love dating apps.
At first glance, it seems that hardly anyone does. Everyone is that friend or has friends who download and delete dating apps cyclically. Yet, no matter how much everyone claims to hate them, everyone still seems to have a folder on their phone that contains apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Raya, Coffee Meets Bagel or whatever other new dating app is currently trending. 
As someone who grew up in a generation immutably connected to technology, it’s not just difficult to find romance without dating apps — it seems downright impossible. Deleting them is practically synonymous to “I’m planning on being single for a while.” While I might be able to come to terms with that (for the time being) and live life dating-app free, there’s absolutely no way that my friends and acquaintances would follow suit if I asked them to. 
This led me to ask myself:  Why exactly do I dislike dating apps?
Well, for answers, let’s turn to season one, episode 10 of the Freeform sitcom “Grown-ish.” In this episode, Sky and Jazz — sisters who run collegiate track — talk about the discrimination they experience as black women in the dating scene. Admittedly, as an Asian man, I felt an eerie amount of correlation between my experiences and the ones Sky and Jazz described. The episode opens up relatively optimistically, with a brief discussion about how our generation is the most diverse and open-minded in dating history. It then quickly segues to consider that, despite this seemingly progressive overlook, there are still some statistically significant racial preferences at play. 
Pointing to data pulled from OKCupid, Tinder and other academic studies, white and Asian women are consistently the highest-rated demographic groups on dating apps. Meanwhile, Asian men and black women are the lowest-rated and most excluded groups. This, of course, should be no surprise. Dating apps are an easily accessible, digital representation of racial preferences in the real world. No matter how you try to spin an app into some groundbreaking, personality-first, connection-creating medium, it’s no different than window-shopping with other people’s photographs. As dating apps continue to dominate, they’ve also ushered in an era of unprecedented racial hierarchies in the dating market, unabated by the awkwardness of first meeting people in real life. 
This is why dating apps bother me. They open up a discussion I wasn’t ready to have, a hard-to-admit feeling that I do sit at the bottom of the racial hierarchy in terms of dating potential. Even worse, I don’t know if these racial preferences can be considered racist, no matter how easy it would be to deem them such. And even if they were racist, what can you do — call out your friends for not having enough diversity in their online matches? Even in this episode of “Grown-ish,” Sky and Jazz talk about how they prefer black guys and are unwilling to change their preferences just because the black guys at their campus aren’t into black girls. 
“I like what I like,” they said. 
What can you even say against that? 
I often wonder about how the connotations of racial preference also differ at the intersection of race and gender. If a heterosexual white male exclusively prefers Asian females, it’s “exotic fetishism.” In the opposite situation, the woman is called a “race-traitor” and “self-hating.” Dating within one’s race exclusively is becoming increasingly controversial, as is dating outside of one’s race. 
As we grow both more diverse and more discriminatory in our own generation, it’s necessary to continue thinking about how race factors into social interactions in our daily lives. I hope we can think critically about just how we form racial preferences in the first place and how we can battle these engrained preferences — because I don’t believe that claiming “I like what I like” is a sufficient response.
A friend texted me recently saying, “There is an incredible amount of racism in the community against Asian guys . . . but I think people that are presented with obstacles and grow from them end up being much happier.” 
While there’s obviously no ill intent here, I can’t help but think this comment can only come from a place of privilege as a white male. Dating apps — and racial preferences by extension — are just another part of the systemic racial discrimination that’s been so integral in shaping my identity and experiences. 
I want to enjoy talking with my friends about their matches on Tinder, but I can’t say it doesn’t hurt my self esteem when we scroll through their matches and I see pages and pages of exclusively white men. To put it simply, I’ll quote this episode of “Grown-ish” one final time: “What I want is to have the same college experience as everyone else.” 
It’s just hard coming to terms with the fact that I know I won’t because of who I am.

In the wake of the class-action lawsuit settlement between USC and student survivors of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged sexual misconduct, it is critical that University administration continue to provide support to all sexual assault victims and raise awareness of campus resources. 
However, students should also be aware of resources beyond those offered by the University. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are criminal offenses, and students can report these incidents to local law enforcement. Students should take initiative and report crimes to local law enforcement, if they do not believe that the University is doing enough to support them.
Sexual assault is one of the most prevalent crimes on college campuses. College-aged women are twice as likely to be assaulted as they are robbed. Among undergraduate students, 23.1 percent of females and 5.4 percent of males will experience sexual assault or abuse, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. 
Many survivors choose not to report to law enforcement for a variety of reasons. For example, victims believe that sexual crimes are a personal matter or that their assault or harassment was not important enough to report. But as evident in allegations against USC doctors, it may take up to 26 years for the University to take action. And USC did so quietly — reports and complaints made in 1990 regarding Tyndall’s abuses remained unaddressed until after his official departure in 2017.
Victims are less likely to report sexual incidents to local law enforcement because of the legal consequences a report on public record will cause their alleged assailant. However, reporting to local law enforcement can break cycles of sexual abuse. Eight out of 10 rapes and similar crimes are perpetrated by someone who the victim knows, such as a friend or a romantic partner. This often makes coming forward a challenge. When a victim reports a sexual crime to local law enforcement, they have several immediate opportunities to heighten their protection, if the perpetrator is taken into custody or the victim files a restraining order. When they report a sexual crime to the University, such protections are often not available.
Victims also are ensured specific rights when they report sexual crimes to law enforcement officials rather than to the University. In California, survivors are protected by the Victims’ Bill of Rights. These rights grant survivors numerous protections, including not being required to participate in the criminal justice system following their report and not needing to provide medical evidence to receive protections. The bill also requires that the victim has the right to request that a member of their same gender be present during any interview with a law enforcement official or district attorney. Victims are also granted access, with financial coverage by the state, to any contraceptive measures taken following the assault. 
The bill also prohibits law enforcement agencies from destroying a rape kit and any additional evidence from an unsolved case before at least 20 years pass, or if a victim was under 18, until the victim’s 40th birthday. The statute of limitations for rape in California also has no limit, meaning that a survivor can report at any point they feel comfortable doing  so. These are more extensive measures than those that have historically been taken by the University, and they give victims more flexibility in reporting incidents. 
Reporting to law enforcement also grants specific protections. Although not all reports will result in criminal prosecution of the perpetrator, making a report mitigates the opportunities for assailants to act again. When crimes go unreported, perpetrators are able to act without consequence and are therefore more likely to act again. 
When victims report sexual crimes to a university, the university’s internal investigations or consequences do not prevent the perpetrator from acting again. Even if an assailant faces expulsion, they are not prevented from repeat offenses. In some cases, reporting to local law enforcement rather than reporting to the University will ensure students more immediate safety.
It is important that survivors are made aware of their rights. Under the Victims’ Bill of Rights, survivors are granted the opportunity to more easily decide when they would like to report, while also decreasing the amount of time required to be present in future criminal proceedings. 
Students need to remember the resources available to them outside the bounds of the University. While enhanced accessibility to resources will not end sexual violence and abuse, it can change the perceived severity of the consequences that occur as a result of abuse and ameliorate the pain suffered by victims.

The Trojan baseball team lost two of three games against Grand Canyon University at Dedeaux Field over the weekend.
USC’s struggles began on Friday in a 4-2 defeat against a GCU team looking to bounce back after three consecutive losses. The game was a defensive stalemate, as both teams went scoreless after five innings, but GCU finally broke the game open at the top of the sixth with a 4-run inning.
With two outs left in the bottom of the seventh inning, sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez started the Trojans’ scoring with a ground ball single up the middle that put redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs on third. The rally continued when junior infielder John Thomas floated a ball over center field that cut the deficit to 2 runs, but the Trojans’ bats cooled down for the rest of the game.
The second game of the series was rained out on Saturday, which meant a doubleheader for the two teams the next day.
USC trailed early after giving up 7 runs in the first three innings to start the day. In the fourth inning, freshman infielder Emilio Rosas put the Trojans on the board with a single that split the gap over right center field.
Outfielders junior Matthew Acosta and sophomore Jamal O’Guinn would chip away at the deficit in the fifth inning with a pair of RBIs that cut GCU’s lead to 4.
GCU sophomore pitcher Zach Barnes responded with a great stretch, retiring nine consecutive batters to set up sophomore pitcher Coen Wynne with a 4-run lead. Wynne pitched a scoreless ninth to close the game for the Antelopes 7-3.
In the second game of the day, the Trojans scored early with a sacrifice fly by O’Guinn that pushed junior outfielder Blake Sabol across home to give USC its first lead of the series.
Grand Canyon would tie things up in the fourth with a solo home run over right center from redshirt sophomore first baseman Cuba Bess. Unfortunately for the Antelopes, their offensive success ended there.
In the sixth inning, USC took back the lead with a RBI single from senior infielder Chase Bushor. A run on a walk by Sabol put the Trojans ahead by 2 runs by the end of the inning.
The two teams entered the eighth inning with the Trojans up 3-1, and USC’s offense put the game away by surging for 4 runs.
With the bases loaded, a wild pitch by GCU senior pitcher Nick Ohanian allowed Bushor to take home and expand the Trojans’ lead to 3.
After GCU walked Stubbs to load the bases again, Acosta pushed 2 runs across by hitting a looper into right field. Sabol and Thomas both scored, bringing the game to 6-1.
“Hitting is contagious, and obviously getting guys on base was the biggest thing no matter what it was — with the walk, hit by pitch or even the hit,” Acosta said. “Hitting is contagious, getting on base is contagious and I’m just happy that we did it all with two outs, and just keeping it going was the biggest thing.”
Before the inning came to a close, Stubbs was walked home to make the score 7-1. Pitchers senior Quentin Longrie and junior Chris Clarke each threw a scoreless frame to end the game, securing the win for the Trojans.
Acosta led the Trojans with 3 RBIs on the day, going 3-for-7 with two doubles and a run. Junior pitcher Connor Lunn picked up the win in relief with three scoreless innings in which he gave up one hit, walked one and struck out two.
With the win, the Trojans avoided a series sweep, hoping to establish some momentum and tighten things up defensively before a tough slate of games.
“The guys [have] just got to keep rolling with some confidence — go up there and just compete, compete, compete,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We need good outings from our pitching, we don’t hurt ourselves and if we do those things, we will be able to win the games 2-1 and 3-2 until we get things rolling offensively.”
The weekend dropped the Trojans to 4-6 as they look ahead to a Tuesday matchup against Loyola Marymount. The first pitch is at 3 p.m. Afterward, USC will face a gauntlet of games over the weekend against Oklahoma State, No. 16 Michigan and No. 2 UCLA.

Hall of Famer Jim “Catfish” Hunter had one of the most prolific careers of any pitcher in professional baseball history. A five-time World Series champion, eight-time All-Star, Cy Young Award winner and one of 23 pitchers with a perfect game, Hunter did it all with a level of skill and wit that has been reached by few, if not none, since. In addition to his magnificent play on the diamond and extremely decade-appropriate ’70s mustache, Catfish Hunter busted open a door of economic freedom never seen before in the world of professional sports. 
Based on the work of Curt Flood who, in 1969, first challenged the MLB’s reserve clause that treated players essentially as property, Hunter officially ushered in what is now known as modern free agency. Gone were the days of Flood’s so-called “well-paid slaves,” and here came a time of unprecedented growth in personal freedom and economic liberty for players. 
In many ways, the decades that would follow were excellent manifestations of sport within a capitalist society. As upsetting and ludicrous as it may seem for athletes to be paid millions to simply play a game, these players negotiated contracts in line with what was considered reasonable market value, and the balance of economic power began to swing in favor of the athlete as opposed to the owner.
This is not to say that the teams did not benefit from the open market of players — they often did. Aside from using free agency to build championship teams on money alone, teams could make investments in superstars such as Alex Rodriguez that could bring money as well as wins to a franchise.
As is the case in any capitalist society, new market conditions spurred change and innovation among the MLB clubs, and teams began looking not to spend the most money but rather to gain the most value from each dollar they spent. 
Small-market, low-budget teams such as the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays began to not only stop playing the same games as the rich teams but managed to find success bucking the trend. Free agency quickly transitioned from an expensive public auction to an uncomfortable afterthought. The history of sports is one of change and adaptation and, as professional baseball stands today, free agency is beginning to be phased out of the equation.
This offseason saw arguably the two most valuable free agents in the history of professional sports hit the open market in Bryce Harper and Manny Machado. Considering that such a reality would be almost impossible to fathom three to five years ago (players of this caliber would’ve been locked down on long-term deals far earlier), it would be expected that these players sign mega-contracts within the first few weeks of the offseason.
Now that the dust has settled, the economics may seem to be the same, but the process has been clearly altered. When Rodriguez signed a seemingly unconscionable 10-year, $252 million contract to play professional baseball with the Texas Rangers,  it made shockwaves across the industry. As relevant today as the gaudy price of the deal for one player in a nine-man lineup is the date when Rodriguez signed. After losing to the Yankees in the 2000 ALCS as a member of the Seattle Mariners, Rodriguez signed with Texas less than two months later in December 2000.
As it stands today, Machado and Harper have very few qualms. The pair signed $300 million and $330 million deals, respectively, which, along with Nolan Arenado’s $260 million contract extension, are three of the five largest total contracts in the history of professional American sports. The issue is that it took until after the start of spring training for these world-class players to officially ink their deals. While players of such value can certainly miss time in camp and remain extremely effective, it’s alarming to see these athletes sign only at the 11th hour.
Elsewhere, high-quality free agents such as World Series champion closer Craig Kimbrel and former Cy Young winner Dallas Keuchel remain on the open market. Keuchel may not be Catfish, but there is simply no excuse for one of the game’s proven starters to still be available, is there?
In sports, teams always harp on the concept of “getting younger” and injecting a squad with youth. This has manifested itself  in baseball, not because of the promise of the future or building a culture nearly as much as the broken system by which young players are paid. In the NBA, NFL and NHL, players who enter the league are compelled to play for their drafting team for only three or four years at most without having the ability to opt out of a deal. In football and basketball specifically, the price a player is paid increases dramatically in the third or fourth year of their initial contract, giving an athlete economic freedom, if nothing else. 
In the MLB, however, players need to accrue a full six years of service time at the top level of the game before they are granted free agency. The first three years are played under a “club controlled” contract before the player can opt for arbitration in the final three years. In either situation, players often are not afforded the opportunity to be paid market value and enter free agency until far later in their careers. 
Simply put, this system must end. Even with players entering the professional ranks out of high school or as teenagers from foreign soil, athletes spend too much time playing for their respective organization to be granted free agency so late into their careers. While leagues like the NBA have succeeded in an environment of personal and economic freedom for athletes, the MLB continues to slip further behind.
With the current collective bargaining agreement set to expire following the 2021 MLB season, it seems likely that pro baseball will join the NFL in a lengthy lockout period as players seek to fix the free agency system among a plethora of different issues plaguing the sport.
The “well-paid slave” may exist no longer, but a whole new era of player freedom issues have taken its place.
