Students, faculty, administrators and members of the public will gather tonight at 6 p.m. in front of the Dept. of Public Safety office to unveil a monument commemorating the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
The memorial features a piece of an I-beam from the World Trade Center, and the event will be free and open to the public. The Fire Department of New York and the September 11th Families’ Association donated the structure after Jennifer Massey, a senior majoring in history, spearheaded an effort to establish a remembrance memorial for the victims of Sept. 11 at USC.
Massey came up with the idea for a remembrance memorial after she heard those around her discuss 9/11 from an Angeleno’s perspective. Locals said they felt disconnected from the tragedy because it happened across the country. With this in mind, she set out to find a way to bring a piece of the World Trade Center to campus.
“The university was extremely supportive from the beginning and thought the memorial was a great idea,” Massey said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
She said she wanted the memorial to serve as a reminder for future generations.
“Most current students remember very little about that day,” Massey wrote. “Sadly, in a few years, USC students will not have been born when it happened. This memorial will allow generations of Trojans to remember and learn about that tragic day.”
The beam is intended to be a tribute to those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks and will give the campus community and surrounding public a space to reflect on the events of that day and pay their respects to anyone impacted. A plaque will be included in the display, and in the coming months USC will include a history board near the beam.
“I am so honored and grateful that of all the places in Los Angeles, USC will have one of the few 9/11 mementos from that horrific day,” Dept. of Public Safety John Thomas said.
The unveiling of the memorial will include members of the USC Naval ROTC, Air Force, Army and Color Guard to present the colors.  Massey and Thomas will speak at the memorial tonight. Dr. Varun Soni, dean of religious life, and Kevin James, president of the City of Los Angeles Board of Public works, will also give speeches.
“9/11 was an American tragedy and a global tragedy,” Soni said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “There were more than 90 countries represented in the deaths at the World Trade Center, and this was a tragedy that reshaped the world in many ways.”
He emphasized that the diversity of the student body enabled it to recognize the importance of the memorial.
“So it is entirely appropriate to install a 9/11 memorial here at USC as our Trojan Family is truly a global family, representing virtually every state in the country, every [country] in the world and every religion on the planet,” Soni wrote.
A wreath will be placed at the memorial site every year on Sept. 11 to honor the 440 first responders, as well as thousands of others who lost their lives on the Tuesday morning that forever changed America.
Chief Thomas has been safely guarding the beam in his office since its arrival in Los Angeles. He noted the spiritual significance behind the beam and how important it was to prevent the I-beam from sitting in an unguarded warehouse.
“What’s important is that we always remember, and never forget, and this is a way that we can never forget,” Thomas said.

Students gathered Wednesday night at the Kappa Kappa Gamma house to hear Liz Funk, author of Supergirls Speak Out: Inside the Secret Crisis of Overachieving Girls, discuss the importance of young women balancing achievements with leisure.
Speaking out · Liz Funk, above, said that young women should not be afraid to spend more of their time on leisurely activities. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
“The requirements of being an ‘it girl’ have changed,” Funk said. “It’s not enough to just be pretty. They need to be smart, charming, people pleasing and of course, nice.”
Funk argued that the perfectionism women are striving toward is the result of a domino effect. If one girl sees the positive outcomes that a “super” or “it” girl achieves, whether it be a top university admittance or an award, others model themselves after this ideal. She said that the solution is for girls to take time to find themselves through leisure.
“You need to start being yourself and doing things in an authentic way,” she said. “When girls start being themselves, others will follow.”
Funk suggested that young women take time to focus on hobbies as a way to relax.
“It’s critically important to have downtime,” she said. “And by that, I mean time where you don’t check emails, where you paint your nails, or don’t go anywhere near your textbook.”
The event was hosted by the Panhellenic Council in an effort to help Greek women and the surrounding community understand that taking time for oneself is necessary for a healthy and fulfilling life. The speech was accompanied by a workshop where those in attendance spoke about their personal struggles with trying to be a “super girl.”
“Despite that today’s young women have more opportunities than ever before, they’re under intense pressure … to be a perfect 10 and excel in everything they attempt,” Funk said.
The author also said that young women are reluctant to slow down and take time for themselves because they feel that their communities would disapprove. She stressed that competition with close friends and other’s perceptions of them make young women question whether they are good enough without their extracurricular and achievements.
“It’s kind of a façade, they’re really kind of exhausted,” Funk said. “Being constantly on the move and constantly part of some project … if many young women felt that they could slow down, they would.”
Mackenzie Roof, event organizer and vice president of athletics for Panhellenic, explained that women in the Panhellenic community are often involved in many extracurricular activities, which can often be overwhelming.
“Add to that their sorority commitments, exercise, eating and sleeping, it’s hard for many people to find time just for themselves,” Roof said. “I hope that this talk can encourage girls to realize that taking time for yourself is not a selfish thing — it can sometimes be the best thing for your future.”
Funk has given presentations about this issue to nearly 100 colleges throughout the United States, including Cornell University, Duke University and New York University.
Women in the audience had mixed reactions to Funk’s ideas. Eleni Sehremelis, a junior majoring in human biology, disagreed with the speaker.
“While I do think it’s important to have some downtime, I think it’s important to be active with your school work and your academics because that is what going to get you far in life,” Sehremelis said.
Not all were dismayed by Funk’s words, however. Some took the advice to heart. Jessica Bjerke, a junior majoring in business administration, was motivated to take a load off her busy schedule.
“It made me want to make more time to just relax,” Bjerke said.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics resumed its event series “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Policy Forum” on Wednesday in the Tutor Campus Center, with a discussion entitled “The Legacies of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown: How the Nation Moves Forward.”
Tough talks · LAPD Commander William Scott speaks at a panel discussion Wednesday noon in Tutor Campus Center as part of the Unruh Institute’s “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Policy Forum” event series. – Jessica Magana | Daily Trojan
 
The panel discussion featured Commander William Scott of the LAPD; Jasmyne Cannick, a community activist and political communications strategist in California; Nathaniel Haas, an editorial columnist for the Daily Trojan and Yasmeen Serhan, special projects editor of the Daily Trojan. The panel was co-moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute, and Euno Lee, editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan.
Schnur opened the panel by highlighting the divisiveness surrounding race relations and police interaction, and asked that the students, faculty and community members in attendance treat the topic sensitively in their participation with the panelists.
“It’s a critically important [issue], and it’s a sensitive one,” Schnur said.
Lee began the discussion by asking Scott what steps the LAPD has taken since the 1992 Los Angeles riots to improve the relationship between the police and the community.
Scott described the evolution of the department’s tactics from suppression-based strategies in the ’70s and ’80s towards a more community-based approach following peak violence in the ’90s.
“In 1992 following the Rodney King trial, we had to revisit what we do … [V]iolent crime was at a high level, centered in minority communities,” Scott said. “Our suppression strategies … led to undermining the other parts of our goal, which was knowing our communities and understanding how they wanted and needed to be policed.”
Scott said the LAPD has moved away from militaristic, tactics-based training and that the department’s “training is more vision and values focused now.”
He conceded, however, that further efforts are required to improve police-community relations.
“The bottom line is [that the LAPD is] trying to increase the amount of trust between us and the community, but we have a lot of work to do,” Scott said.
When asked the same question, Cannick was quick to reframe the issue.
“The words that are often used to described [the events of] 1965 and 1992 are ‘riots’, but a lot of us consider them an ‘uprising’ or a ‘rebellion,’” Cannick said.
Cannick also compared the lack of transparency within the LAPD to that of the Ferguson police department this summer. The necessity of open communication between the police, the press and the community was a salient issue for panelists, who brought up the social media and journalist response to Ferguson this summer. Panelists agreed that police non-cooperation and infringement on freedom of the press were disconcerting.
“A lot of the [media] sources that we sent were being silenced or barred … [E]leven journalists were arrested,” Serhan said.
When asked what effect the media has on forming public opinion in racially charged cases such as these, Haas explained the importance of the dynamic between the police, the media and the public.
“The question to ask is not ‘What happens when communication breaks down between the media and the public?’ but ‘What happens when the communication breaks down between the media and the police department?’” he said.
Cannick said that the media needed “more rapid responses” from police with “correct, factual and honest answers.”
Ultimately, all panelists agreed on the importance of a continuing dialogue between the community and members of the police force in order to move forward on racial profiling issues. Scott recalled the tense discussion between the LAPD and the USC community after the department shut down a predominately minority graduation party in riot gear in spring 2013.
“Dialogue can go a long way, and it’s not always comfortable,” Scott said. “You get in a room and talk about racial relations, and it is not comfortable, but we have to do it.”

Before you buy that mundane, mass-produced IKEA poster for your room, consider original prints from Angeleno Artistry, an L.A.-based startup founded by a group of USC alumni. Every month, five new artists are selected to showcase their work on their website and sell a limited number of their prints.

The startup’s goal is to reinvigorate the art industry and connect local artists with the community.
“Angeleno Artistry is modernizing the art world,” said Zack Holland, one of the founders and a USC alumnus who graduated in 2013. “We are celebrating underrepresented and deserving artists, and bringing original art to a broader, younger audience.”
Combating commercialized stock art, Angeleno Arts was launched to address the need for original artwork.
“Even if all of an artist’s prints sell out on the website, people still have the opportunity to connect with the artist,” Holland said. “If you like an artist’s work, you can commission them to do another, unique piece for you.”
Holland recognizes historical trends in the art industry and hopes to modernize old traditions for new consumers.
“It used to be popular to commission artists, but it’s something that has become antiquated,” Holland said.
Holland believes that with a modern approach and accessible platform, Angeleno Artistry will bridge the gap between consumers and artists.
Through the newly launched website, Holland and the other founders hope to generate opportunities for talented local artists and to combat the inundation of conventional and uninspiring artwork that is produced by larger companies.
“It’s a pretty tough road for artists, especially after graduation. It’s difficult to get commissioned work, and that’s what our company is seeking to improve,” Holland said.
Angeleno Artistry also draws from the immense artistic community in L.A. Featured artists are selected by a diverse group of qualified leaders from the L.A. area, which include gallery directors and professionals from the art industry.
Many of the L.A.-based artists are alumni from the USC Roski School of Art and Design, and Holland encourages current Roski students and alumni to submit work to the company’s email address. If selected for the month, each artists will be able to sell 100 copies of their signed, featured prints for $40 each.
With the newly launched platform, the five artists for September include USC alumni from the class of 2014. The artists KFiSH, JD Higham, Wasim of Nazareth, Stephen Paul and Marilee Spencer present pieces that satisfy a wide variety of tastes, colors and styles. The artists’ work include underwater and landscape photography, mixed media and whimsical portraits that captivate the imagination. Their work is refreshing and stimulating in comparison to tiresome mass-produced prints.
In addition to changing the art industry’s landscape, Angeleno Artistry is also giving back to the L.A. community. With every sale, the startup will donate $5 to the company’s philanthropic partner, P.S. Arts, an organization that funds art education in underprivileged L.A. schools.
“Art is important, and it’s important in the education of young people. When schools face budget cuts, usually art programs are the first to be dismantled,” Holland said.
Holland stresses the significance of art in education. Not only will Angeleno Arts donate proceeds to P.S. Arts, but featured artists will also have the opportunity to teach their skills in Los Angeles classrooms. They will teach a wide variety of media, including photography, paint and sculpture.
“The abundance of incredible and creative art in Los Angeles deserves a better platform where local artists and their work can be seen, enjoyed and appreciated,” the company mission stated. “The ability to do just that, while making a difference with an amazing non-profit partner like P.S. Arts is all that we hoped for while working tirelessly to put Angeleno Artistrty together.”
Los Angeles offers an eclectic and distinct array of creative flair that often goes unnoticed. Angeleno Artistry highlights and exhibits the innovative and expressive styles that are only found within Los Angeles.
“Beauty is found everywhere in Los Angeles, albeit in the most unexpected of places: the shadowy sides of water towers and the half-toothed smile of the friendly neighborhood park-bench-resident. It’s this mangled and hectic collage of sun and color that makes LA [sic] so unique — that unexplainable yet undeniable Angeleno Artistry,” states the company.
As far as the group’s mission statement, Holland keeps it simple.
“Hang real and original artwork,” Holland said.
This is a great idea and the prints make unique and affordable gifts. Instead of buying a gift card for a birthday present, I’ll buy one of these cool prints. Limited edition means if the artist hits it big, you might be selling it for Big $$$$$ on Pawn Stars one day in the future.
what a great initiative! for those who haven’t checked in out, head to http://www.AngelenoArtistry.com – it deserves a few moments of your time. i just ordered a couple prints!

McConnell’s Ice Cream believes their ice cream should be its own food group. Given their unique flavors and vast array of ice-cream-based concoctions, they might have a case. Accordingly, this past July, a sweltering time when Angelenos often wished that ice cream was the only food group, this historic brand and Santa Barbara, California mainstay popped up in the heart of burgeoning downtown Los Angeles.
Located a short distance from USC via public transport is Grand Central Market, located on 4th Street between Broadway Avenue Street and Hill Street. On the Hill Street side, the market faces the romantic Angel’s Flight railway and Angel’s Knoll Park with a lone park bench visitors might be familiar with from (500) Days of Summer. The movie also featured Grand Central Market, albeit without all the new shops that have recently come to the venue and made it a foodie paradise. Nestled in the center of the hustle and bustle of the market is McConnell’s, wedged between Wexler’s Deli and Lupita’s Fresh Seafood. Even on weekday afternoons, there are a handful of people clustered around the retro-esque red and white counter, which directly faces Sticky Rice.
McConnell’s serves a hand-crafted all-American ice cream, originally from Santa Barbara. The company has been around since 1949 and has always made its cream without preservatives, stabilizers or additives. The ice cream is made in small batches, starting with the custard base made with raw milk that is pasteurized in-house and then going through a high-precision and slow churning process called the French pot, which gives the ice cream its sticky smooth texture. McConnell’s has an edge on the other companies because of its creamery at The Old Dairy, which is the oldest of the nine original dairies in Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara has been McConnell’s headquarters for decades. McConnell’s other ingredients are organic and sustainable-sourced from decade-long partnerships.
Santa Barbara chef Eva Ein and her husband, winemaker Michael Palmer, took over the business in 2012. They decided to open up a Los Angeles shop in Grand Central because the market already has G&B Coffee, which had been using their fine ice creams to great success, and because Grand Central has, like McConnell’s, a long tradition.
The space is small, as all the stalls in Grand Central are, but it still manages to pack in a lot of flavor choices, including Yelp favorites Turkish coffee and Eureka lemon with marionberries. Flavors ranged from old school mint chip, vanilla, strawberry and sweet cream and cookies to the exotic flavors that are now trendy in the world of frosty desserts, including the limited edition olive oil and salted almonds, chocolate almond brittle and milk chocolate and raspberry jam. The seasonal flavor for summer is the summer fruit cobbler.
The store also offers a variety of sundaes for less than $7, such as the PB&J sundae, a twist on a school lunch classic made with dark chocolate-raspberry brownies topped with scoops of raspberry and milk chocolate ice cream and drizzled with molten peanut butter sauce. Their shakes sport attention-grabbing names like the “Breakfast of Champions,” which contains sweet cream ice cream, cornflake crackle, milk infused with cornflakes, brown sugar and a variety of secret ingredients. Customers might want to take their dessert to go, though — seating is a bit hard to find during peak hours at the market.
The churros con leche is one of McConnell’s signature flavors and tastes gloriously cinnamon-like. There is also the option of churros con sundae, made with two scoops of McConnell’s churro con leche ice cream with salted caramel sauce, pepita seed brittle and whipped cream. You can also build your own sundae or ice cream sandwich with freshly baked cookies. Hand-packed pints go for $9.
What stands out is that the texture of the ice cream is sticky but smooth, rich and milky. However, the flavors tend towards sweetness, particularly the salted caramel chip. As salted caramel has become so ubiquitous in artisanal ice cream, it is an easy barometer by which to judge. Customers should not find the sweetness cloying, however, and many will find it a virtue rather than a defect. Portions are large and single scoops go for $4.25, while double scoops are $6.50. A recommendation for first timers is the “Flight of Three Scoops,” which at $5.50 allows you to try three flavors in one go.

Souled Out, Jhené Aiko’s newest album, was released Tuesday, and the soulful R&B singer’s creative composition and soft, haunting vocals create a soundscape that is both fresh and historic, blending genres into an album that operates as an artpiece.

While Aiko’s signature blend of R&B and hip-hop still remains, her most recent album opens up new doors into her history and personal life. She sings about her family, her fears and aspirations, and lays it over complex, soulful instrumentals that capture the feelings exhibited in her words.
The overall mood of the album is both hopeful and forlorn, reflecting the events of her past few years. While Aiko’s career has begun to take off, her family life has been changing rapidly, from the birth of her daughter to the loss of her brother after his battle with cancer.
The stress of all of these events is present in each moving track off Souled Out. She opens with “Limbo Limbo Limbo,” a track that is seemingly about her own life thus far and the fear of being unable to control it.
She then segues into “W.A.Y.S.,” a song about pushing through pain, and one of the strongest tracks on the album. She takes the time to remind herself to stand tall as she sings, “Life only gets harder but you gotta get stronger / this is for my brother / I do this for my daughter.”The underlying string instruments paired with echoed drumbeats that are reminiscent of raindrops create a melancholy that inspires feelings of defeat and strength.
The next song, “To Love & Die” was the first single off the album, and it has both a memorable chorus and borrowed lyrics from the 50 Cent track, “Many Men,” making it a strong first single. The track was released in June, and it now sits nicely in the album, nestled in a sea of relaxing instrumentals and emotional lyrics.
Moving past “Spotless Mind,” a track about the fear of change and wandering, Aiko takes on romance in “It’s Cool.” The song is a second person love story about a man who caught her when she was down. The bluesy riff and instrumentals add to the loving nature of the track in another mixing of genres by the young artist.
In stark contrast to “It’s Cool,” the next track, “Lyin King” is the heartbreak felt by a woman who confesses unrequited love. She sings about a man who was a “serial lover,” and uses the metaphor of a lion throughout the whole track to emphasize pain she feels, saying he steals hearts and feeds them to his “pride.”
Aiko’s seventh track, “Wading” continues the unfolding love story, as she ponders whether or not she should continue to wade into the open ocean or wait for her lover to swim out. The indecisiveness continues in the second single of the album, “The Pressure.” With a music video directed by Childish Gambino, this song is a strong showing of Aiko’s talents, both lyrically and musically. The opening line “I care about you baby/ baby, more than you’ll ever know,” captures the brooding nature of the entire album. “The Pressure” has a strong backbeat punctuated by treble hits and electric guitar riffs that are a common occurrence on the album, giving it both a coherence with the rest of Souled Out and a unique genre-bending sound.
“Brave” praises a new man for loving her even though she is “in no condition” to love him. The hook has Aiko calling her lover “stone cold crazy” for loving her, furthering the themes of hope and fear present throughout the album. In what is the beginning of a happier section of the album, Aiko is finally showing some positivity in her lyricism.
“Eternal Sunshine” is probably the happiest track on the album, and the piano playing a reflective riff helps to slowly wrap up the album. This track will make you want to Facebook stalk your ex and remember all the good memories associated with them.
It is powerful and heartfelt, and it sets up the next song, which is the most insightful track on Souled Out. “Promises” features NAMIKO and Miyagi, Aiko’s daughter and late brother, in an opening that must be an old recording of the two interacting before Miyagi’s death to cancer.
It is heartfelt and raw, incorporating NAMIKO into the chorus even though she is only 5 years old, and feels more like a reassurance of herself than a track meant for the public. The intimacy of the track creates a strong bond with Aiko that is rarely seen in music today, and if I had to recommend one track, this would be the one.
Last on the regular verion of Souled Out is “Pretty Bird (Freestyle),” a track recorded with Common that lightens the mood of the album just before the end.
“Yes, this is all I have left in me” are the opening lyrics to the song, before Aiko riffs with Common and reflects on the body of work she just created. She acknowledges her sadness in the form of a pretty bird that never flies, but also notes that there is a “blinding light” inside her. In this verse, Aiko proves herself as more than just a beautiful lyricist — she’s a great freestyle artist as well. Common then backs up Aiko’s verse with what feels like a spoken word performance, and gives the album actual cohesiveness instead of sounding like a record company’s sales formula.
Overall, it is refreshing to hear an artist blending genres and working independently of pop charts, and Aiko’s crisp, soulful sound paired with her mournful lyrics provide the perfect soundtrack to a rainy day.

The USC women’s volleyball team began the season with two road tournaments, winning all three games in each event. Now, the No. 6 Women of Troy (6-0) look to defend their home court as they host the USC Classic on Thursday and Friday at the Galen Center.
Serial killer · Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio has started the year on a high note, recording 66 kills in the team’s first six games. – Ralph Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The team will face Texas A&M on Thursday and No. 20 Florida on Friday. No. 13 San Diego will also compete in the tournament, but they are slated to play only Texas A&M and Florida.
Despite concerns regarding the team’s youth, the Women of Troy already dominated both the Community Bankers Volleyball Classic in Stockton, California and the Commonwealth Classic in Lexington, Kentucky this season. In three of their six matches, the Women of Troy didn’t give up a single set. In addition, the Women of Troy have given up two sets in a match to an opponent only once so far this season, against the host Pacific Tigers in the Community Bankers Volleyball Classic.
Head coach Mick Haley was impressed with his team’s performance in Kentucky and believes they are ready for their home tournament this weekend.
“All of the competition was as good or better than the competition we played the week before [in the Community Bankers Volleyball Classic],” Haley said. “We came out of there with three wins. We only lost one set. This competition this week probably is going to be as good.”
Haley also said that finally playing at home will help his team.
“For the players, it’s a fresh breath of air,” Haley said. “They get to sleep in their own beds. They’re right here on campus [and] they get to play in front of their own fans. For them, it’s a real treat.”
The Women of Troy showed why they are ranked No. 6 in the nation in the two tournaments, but Haley says there are still changes that need to be made.
“We’re growing and we’re getting better,” Haley said. “But we’re still a work in progress.”
So far this season, USC has received major contributions from a number of players. Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio leads the team so far this season with 66 kills and has recorded more than half of the team’s service aces with 20. Bricio also has been strong on defense, recording the fourth-most digs so far this season for the Women of Troy with 56.
Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu made her season debut on the volleyball court during the Women of Troy’s game against Kentucky in the Commonwealth Classic, and she started to make an impact almost immediately. In only three games this season, Nwanebu already ranks fourth on the team in kills with 37, fourth in hitting percentage at .390 and owns the highest kills per set average on the team at 3.70.
The Lucas, Texas native said she missed her time on the court and is glad to be contributing again.
“It feels awesome,” said Nwanebu. “I didn’t realize how much I would miss it until I was actually playing again. I hope to never have an injury like that again. It was awful sitting out for that long. The girls were just amazing. Through everything, they supported me.”
Nwanebu also said her leadership role with the team is mainly to help her teammates bond more.
“I feel like my leadership is just to try to make them feel more part of the team,” she said. “I just try to get their confidence up like the older girls did for me.”
Other notable players on the team that have made a difference early on include senior setter Hayley Crone, sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola, freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis and sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham. Crone and Pizzasegola have excelled at their position, setting up 248 kills combined this season.
Even more impressive is that those 248 assists are more than the total amount of assists USC has allowed from all their opponents combined this season. Gillis currently ranks second in both kills and digs for the Women of Troy with 53 and 63, respectively. Whittingham leads the team in digs with 67, in addition to 11 assists.
Gillis says she had a great time on the six-game road trip to begin the season.
“I think it was fun,” Gillis said. “I liked going on the road because there is a lot more pressure at home. So, [at] away games, you can just kind of let go.”
USC is riding momentum heading into their home tournament this weekend, but winning their own tournament will not be an easy task. Texas A&M holds a 5-1 record and a three game winning streak coming into this tournament. With that said, Texas A&M has likely done well this season in part due to the strength of their schedule. In fact, the six teams Texas A&M has faced this season combine for 12 wins and 23 losses.
Texas A&M might also be considered the weakest team in this tournament because they are the only team competing that is not nationally ranked.
When they play Texas A&M, the Women of Troy will have to keep an eye on Angela Lowak and Ashlie Reasor. Lowak leads Texas A&M in kills with 57 and has the third-most amount of digs on the team with 49. Reasor has also been a major contributor to Texas A&M, recording 46 kills and 25 digs so far this year.
No. 10 Florida has dropped its last two games, but holds a 3-2 record. The team’s two losses were against Florida State and Texas, two top-10 teams.
When the Women of Troy play Florida, the focus will be on containing setters Alex Holston and Mackenzie Dagostino. Holston leads her team in kills with 63 and Dagostino has nearly all of her team’s assists this season with 213. Dagostino also has the third-most digs on Florida with 40.
San Diego, though they won’t face the Women of Troy, will surely cause problems for Texas A&M and Florida. The Toreros boast a 5-1 record and are currently on a four-game winning streak. Middle hitter Alaysia Brown, setter Jianna Bonomi and outside hitter Sandra Lozic will be the players to watch on San Diego.
Brown leads her team in kills with 69 and is third on the team in hitting percentage at .321. Bonomi has collected a team-leading 137 assists  and ranks second on the team in digs with 57. Lozic ranks third on the team in both kills with 47 and digs with 45.
It definitely won’t be an easy task to win this weekend for the Women of Troy, but Haley is ready for it based on how his team played last week.
“I think Kentucky plays evenly with [Texas] A&M and challenges Florida a bit,” Haley said. “Florida is a very athletic team and they’ll be fun to watch. I think this is another good challenge for us.”

One game at a time. That’s the popular expression that college football coaches like to use in the face of a trap game. Whether it’s a few weeks before a key matchup or a letdown right after a big win, most teams will face one or two potential upset losses each year.
This week’s trip to Boston College fits the definition of a trap game to a tee. When the Trojans take the field against the Eagles, Steve Sarkisian’s team will be seven days removed from a physically and emotionally draining win, thousands of miles from home and staring ahead at a much needed bye week. Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard, the captain of a defense that struggled for much of the Stanford game, will miss the first half. Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen took a 23-carry beating against the Cardinal, while redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler — two weeks removed from a toe operation — only attempted 22 passes.
When I really look at it, Saturday’s game feels almost too much like a trap. So much like a trap, in fact, that I know the Trojans are going to win. And it’s not going to be close.
The Eagles were gashed for 305 rushing yards in a home loss to Pittsburgh last week, and didn’t score a touchdown against winless Massachusetts until the third quarter of their opener. The Lane Kiffin-coached Trojans beat down Boston College 35-7 at the Coliseum a season ago — and that was with the now-departed Heisman candidate Andre Williams still on the squad. To add injury to insult, Boston College will face USC without Sean Duggan, the team’s own senior linebacker and captain who is out with a bone bruise.
So what now? I could go on and on about how sure I am that we’ll win — digging myself an even deeper hole if we do end up losing — but I’d rather not waste a whole column on it. Luckily, I don’t have to follow the “one game at a time” philosophy.
Looking past the Boston College matchup, USC is entering a scary part of its schedule. Provided that the Trojans keep winning, the team will be favored in every game it plays for the rest of the regular season. Save for an extremely dominant run from No. 11 Notre Dame, No. 12 UCLA or No. 16 Arizona State, the No. 9 Trojans will be ranked ahead of every team they play for the rest of their schedule as well. This, I cannot stress enough, is not a good thing.
The Pac-12 is, top-to-bottom, the toughest conference in the nation this season. Even if it wasn’t, history tells us that no one gets through this conference unscathed. Ask Oregon fans what it’s like to have your national championship dreams crushed by Stanford two years in a row. Ask UCLA fans what it’s like to have Arizona State come into your own building and snuff out your shot at a BCS bowl. Hell, ask Stanford fans what it’s like to have Andre F-cking Heidari stab you in the heart, twice.
Of course I’m hoping against hope that the Trojans run the table and end up at Levi’s Stadium in early December for a shot at an undefeated season. But realistically that’s not going to happen — and that’s O.K.! We can still play for a Pac-12 title with a loss, maybe even two, under our belts. Where the loss(es) may come from, however, is an interesting question. I’ve ruled out Boston College — guys, please win — but there are a number of rivalry showdowns and legitimate trap games left on USC’s schedule.
The Trojans’ next big showdown comes at home against Arizona State early next month. The Sun Devils returned an NFL prospect at quarterback, Taylor Kelly, and have unleashed a rising star in versatile running back D.J. Foster. Still, the Arizona State defense currently sits in a tie for 75th in the nation — after two games against Weber State and New Mexico, no less.
We can then skip ahead to a late November battle with UCLA at the Rose Bowl. In unbiased terms, the Bruins have not looked good thus far. Heisman candidate Brett Hundley and his offense looked rudderless in the opener at Virginia, but were saved by some defensive magic. Hundley looked great last week at home against an inferior Memphis squad, but the game devolved into a worrisome shootout. Still, I refuse to overlook UCLA; eventually the team will put these two facets of the game together and start dominating.
Just a week after what will surely be a physical battle with the Bruins, USC hosts Notre Dame in its final regular season game. With the return of quarterback Everett Golson to the program and a somewhat favorable schedule, there’s an outside chance that the Irish will be fighting for a playoff berth come Nov. 29. Even if the Trojans are the better team, postseason pressures and what seems like a mental block against Notre Dame over the past few seasons could be a factor in the game. A Max Wittek-led USC squad couldn’t get the job done against Golson and the Irish in 2012, and last year, well, Andre F-cking Heidari.
Of USC’s remaining games, home battles against Cal and Colorado along with a road trip to beleaguered Washington State should spell easy wins. Oregon State seems to have plateaued after making strides last year. That leaves two road trips, one to Arizona and another to Utah, that scare me the most of any games this season.
Arizona Stadium is not a friendly place to highly ranked teams. The Wildcats are good for at least one home upset of a top-10 team every year. Seriously, look it up, I’m not kidding. Last year it was a 42-16 drubbing of No. 5 Oregon. In 2012, if anyone cares to remember, it was a shootout win over 10th-ranked USC. In 2010 ,the Nick Foles-led Cats took down No. 9 Iowa. So yeah, this game freaks me out a bit.
Two weeks later, the Trojans travel to face a Utah team that also has a knack for upset wins. I doubt Stanford fans have a fond recollection of the No. 5 Cardinal’s trip to Salt Lake City last season. More bad news for USC? The Utes beat up Fresno State last week nearly as bad as the Trojans did in their opener.
I can’t rule USC out of any game this season, but I don’t see the team getting through both of those trap games unscathed. I can’t seem to put my finger on a definitive reason for that statement, other than that’s just how major college football works. Teams aren’t supposed to go undefeated, especially teams with a new coach and this many freshmen at key positions.
Still, nobody expected anyone to be having this conversation about the Trojans three weeks into the season. Maybe Oregon, Stanford or UCLA, but not USC. We were supposed to lose last week. Which is funny, because at least so far, this team isn’t really interested in what it’s supposed to do.

The USC football team continued to prepare for its long road trip to Boston at practice on Wednesday. Head coach Steve Sarkisian called it a productive day and  praised the Trojans’ execution and energy.

No Campfire Songs
USC will face another tough test on Saturday as they travel more than 3,000 miles to play the Boston College Eagles in an attempt to improve their record to 3-0. Though the team will be making quite a trek, Sarkisian stressed the importance of focusing more on the game than the location.
“We [need to] keep doing things the way we do them regardless of who the opponent is or where we’re headed,” Sarkisian said. “Ultimately, it’s going to be about how we play Saturday night.”
The Trojans understand that it is always a challenge to play on the road, but coming off a huge conference win at Stanford, the team is prepared to deal with adversity and rally around the challenges that a road game entails.
“It wasn’t us sitting around a campfire and singing songs together,” Sarkisian said in reference to the Stanford trip. “It was hard. It was grueling. It was guys potentially wanting to tap out, coaches included … [But] you rely on the people around you to keep building you back up and [motivate you].”
Sarkisian did not seem worried about a letdown following such an emotional victory against Stanford. He emphasized the focus and preparation of the team and hopes to see even more improvement as the week goes on.
Fighting through the pain
After winning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts against Stanford, junior defensive end Leonard Williams is still dealing with an ankle injury that nearly kept him from playing last week and has limited his availability in practice. Though his injury might prove to be bothersome, the defensive captain is determined to play in Boston.
“The reason I go out there and try to fight through all these games is because I want to have a good season this year … I want to take this team as far as possible,” Williams said. “I’d never want to sit on the sideline and watch them fight through a tough game knowing I can’t help out.”
Williams made it clear that his ankle feels better than it did in the week of practice leading up to the Stanford game, and when asked if there was a chance that he might not be able to play on Saturday, Williams responded, “No, I’m going to play.”
Williams should get the opportunity to repeat his dominant performance from Saturday against the Eagles as long as he remains healthy, and after Wednesday’s practice, he appears to be ready.
“Obviously we got more work out of Leonard today than we did yesterday, which is a positive,” Sarkisian said. “Our goal is to go win the game. If Leonard is healthy enough to play, he’s going to play.”
Time to step up
Due to his ejection in the second half of the Stanford game, redshirt senior linebacker Hayes Pullard is required to sit out the first half of Saturday’s game. Stepping into his starting role will be sophomore Michael Hutchings, who seemed prepared and excited to contribute on the defensive end.
“I feel like I’ve played well. I study Hayes’ every move,” Hutchings said. “I feel like I’m ready to take on this moment.”
While Hutchings will not have to stop the struggling Eagles’ offense on his own, he will be called upon to be a leader for the defensive unit at the strong side inside linebacker position. Other members of the defensive unit have expressed their support for the inexperienced Antioch, California native.
“The team lets him know that we count on him and we trust him,” Williams said. “We let him know that he can handle it.”

Ask any L.A. resident what his or her dream job is, and chances are, his or her answer won’t include careers in the labor, fast food or waste management sectors. These jobs are known for hours upon hours of stressful, backbreaking work. On Labor Day, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti recognized the city’s hardworking, underpaid laborers with a proposal that would raise the city’s minimum wage to $13.25 an hour over the course of three years.
Garcetti’s proposal should be supported because of its potential to lift Angelenos out of poverty. Instead of sparring over potential changes in inflation rate, price level and gross domestic product, city council members should focus on one concrete statistic: the one million L.A. workers living in poverty. The raise would be a significant increase from the current minimum wage of just $9 an hour, barely enough to cover basic living expenses in Los Angeles.
Those who work minimum wage jobs are vital to both the economy and society. Most minimum wage workers come from the restaurant, retail, administrative, waste management and health services sectors. In spite of their importance, workers in these sectors barely earn enough to sustain themselves. Twenty-eight percent of working Angelenos currently live below the poverty line. Embarrassing and simply unacceptable, this statistic is a wake-up call that it’s time to significantly raise the city’s minimum wage.
As the Senate struggles to pass a federal wage increase, major cities are taking matters into their own hands. Seattle set an example by setting its minimum wage at $15 an hour. Los Angeles, often considered a trendsetting city, now needs to follow Seattle’s lead and raise wages to match increasing costs of living.
In fact, Massachussetts Institute of Technology’s living wage calculator lists the living wage for a Los Angeles County resident with no dependents at over $11 an hour. “Living wage” is defined as basic expenses, including medical fees, food, housing and transportation. Despite the fact that most Angelenos would agree that those are all basic needs, some still oppose the wage raise.
Many opponents of the wage raise claim that it would cause a decrease in the overall number of jobs. Any decrease in job numbers, however, would most likely be marginal. According to a UC Berkeley study, previous economic research on “federal, state and local minimum wage increases has found little to no measurable effect on employment or hours from minimum wage policies.”
Contrary to many opponents’ beliefs, raising the minimum wage would positively impact businesses. When people don’t make enough money to cover their basic living expenses, they’re not going to purchase things that aren’t absolutely necessary. Increased income means more purchasing power, which in turn will increase overall spending. This increase in purchases could help businesses offset the costs of the raised wages. The main thing opponents need to recognize is the people this increase would positively impact. Minimum wage workers often work in difficult environments with little room for upward growth. Increasing wages would reward these workers for their work and hopefully boost overall worker morale.
College students would also benefit from the raise. Most jobs that college students hold are minimum wage, so students use precious time working for a nearly inconsequential amount of money compared to their total tuition. A raise in the minimum wage would mean college students could spend less hours working, giving them more time to focus on school.
A minimum wage raise would bring some economic relief to the groups who need it. Eighty  percent of Los Angeles’ poor working families would see increased income, and 83 percent of affected workers come from minority groups. In a best-case scenario, the extra money could allow low-income families to live a bit more comfortably and break families out of the cycle of poverty.
The Watts neighborhood near USC is a local example of the need for a pay raise. The average household size in Watts is four people, but the median income hovers around $25,000, well below the poverty line. According to MIT’s living wage calculator, an individual supporting a four-person household must earn $22 an hour to meet the entirety of the family’s basic living expenses. Clearly, raising the minimum wage to $22 is unrealistic, but this does show how sizable the gap is between the money families need and the amount they currently earn.
Though an increase in wages obviously won’t immediately solve all of the city’s poverty problems, it will be a small step in the right direction. Economic statistics are always fluctuating, so those voting on the proposal should instead consider the human aspect. One million people are worth more than whatever slight economic changes the raise could cause. Garcetti’s proposal could improve the standard of living for many Angelenos, and for that reason, it’s worth a shot.
 
The entire argument about raising the min wage in this article is based on the fact the min wage earner need more money. That is a poor, unsustainable, unrealistic argument. The reality is we can cynically raise the min wage level and hope to keep these people living still very dismal lives or we can raise the entire consciousness of WHY PEOPLE EARN MIN WAGES!!!!! Go into any inner city public high school – take a look at all the kids goofing around and disrespecting their teachers and education – and you will see the next generation of self entitled people asking for high min wages. When Detroit went broke – the mealy-mouthed politicians and sanctimonious liberals kept saying that the fall of Detroit did not happen overnight – but was decades in the making. Unless LA gets real with its unrealistic notions of paying people more then they are worth – we too shall go the way of Motor City
How exactly did the few people at City Hall get enough information to decide how much other people should pay their employees? Where is the study that using scarce law enforcement dollars to fix prices will have a positive outcome for more than a small minority? There are not enough police to monitor every business and household in Los Angeles. One likely result is that the minimum wage law will not be uniformly enforced so some businesses will cheat and gain excess profits. Look out there today. We already have minimum wage laws. We already have businesses that cheat. There are exceptions to the existing minimum wage laws! Adding one more minimum wage will not solve poverty. It just gives false hope for a better life without effort.

On Aug. 2, two LAPD officers beat the unarmed Omar Abrego to death after stopping his car in front of his home on the corner of 69th and Main St. On Aug. 11, two different LAPD officers stopped and killed unarmed Ezell Ford right off the corner of 65th and Broadway.  These killings happened less than four miles away from our campus, and yet most students haven’t even heard of them.
Perhaps these stories got lost in the shadow of the Ferguson riots. Perhaps, since they happened before the semester started, the news didn’t reach as many students. Whatever the case, the reality is that these were killings of unarmed citizens by LAPD officers within the community USC students live in, and the silence from this campus is deafening.
In the first few days after the incidents, several events were held against these injustices. There was a protest in front of the LAPD headquarters, there was a community meeting at a church on Broadway, and there were the aforementioned marches through the neighborhood where the killings themselves occurred. As days turned into weeks — without the LAPD even releasing the names of the officers responsible — the outrage in the community started to simmer down. Only the marches, organized by civil rights group BAMN (By Any Means Necessary), seemed to persevere.
“Now that, through our efforts … the LAPD has released the names of the officers responsible, the next step is to get these officers on trial and truth of that needs to be exposed all over Los Angeles,” said Southern California coordinator for BAMN, Hoku Jeffrey.
Progress is happening, but the marches are struggling to maintain momentum. The general consensus among marchers is that most community members are scared to join for fear of a response by the LAPD. This is an understandable reaction because, despite its insistence to want to work with the community, the LAPD’s track record paints a different picture. Countless investigative traffic stops, disproportionate responses to minor complaints and periodic police violence are part of daily life in the community. It is understandable that there are strong reservations among its members. It is, however, not acceptable.
Another underlying issue is that USC has cultivated a bubble in which most students feel isolated from the community surrounding them.
“The university park area has a polarized populace, consisting of some of the wealthiest young adults living amongst some of the most poverty stricken families in Los Angeles,” said Adrian Camarena, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “This polarized population often misunderstands each other … when as a community they should come together and help the area.”
The problems of the surrounding community are very much students’ problems as well. In May 2013, the LAPD sent 79 officers to shut down one party on 23rd and Hoover, and the fact that the demographic of the party was largely African-American did not go unnoticed by students. The LAPD that showed up in droves that day is the same LAPD that patrols our community now, and it is the same LAPD that killed Ezell Ford and Omar Abrego 30 blocks south of campus.
Again, all USC students can’t be expected to jump into these efforts. But the virtual silence should not be allowed to continue. For those interested in marching, meet at 5:30 p.m. on the corner of 65th and Broadway most days. At the very least, there needs to be conversation on these incidents. As USC students, we are all part of this community. We should feel compelled to get involved.
Are you speaking about the same students who are racists and continue to segregate themselves by having drunken parties according to race? Are these the same irresponsible students who behave like a bunch of juvenile delinquents on the weekends disrupting hard working people at night? Where are all the black students protesting the black on black killings right now going on in South LA that LAPD is having to clean up and look for suspects?

Twelve hundred dollars.
That is, according to the College Board, the amount the average college student pays for textbooks each year. The fact that textbooks are expensive is no shocking revelation. But what is shocking is the impact textbook prices are having on students. A recent survey by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Foundation, which polled 2,039 students from over 150 campuses, found that “nearly half of students said textbook costs impacted how many and which classes they took each semester.”
This pricing problem at first glance appears to stem from publishing companies. As former textbook publishing employee Zachary Crockett describes in a Priceconomics.com article, publishing companies don’t make a great deal of profit on the first editions of textbooks. Rather than profiting from high prices, much of their revenue is used for royalties, advertising, materials, editorial costs and other miscellaneous expenses. As Crockett estimates, the profit margin for one individual unit is only about 22 percent. For new editions of previous books, however, many of the expenses, such as editing, are greatly reduced. These companies simply add a section or two, update the cover, fix some typos and sell it as a new edition at little cost.
Publishing companies aren’t the only problem. Some professors are guilty of encouraging students to buy these overpriced new editions by putting them on their required reading. The thing is, the latest editions aren’t always necessary. This issue also involves school administrations that don’t seem to have considered how lower- and middle-class students end up paying for textbooks. At any private university — USC included — there are, of course, quite a few students who can afford to dish out $1,200 a year for textbooks. But the fact of the matter is that, for many students, paying that much for books would be a struggle, especially considering that over 60 percent of USC students receive financial aid.
Despite earning the ire of many students, the bookstore, which must mark up prices in order to make a profit, should not be blamed. The money from such markups is allocated to pay wages, taxes and other operational expenses. Ideally, books shouldn’t cost this much, but that is in the hands of the publishers, not the bookstore.
There are relatively simple solutions for this issue. First, teachers should allow older editions of textbooks to be used and supplement these editions with articles regarding current events. While this might take professors a few extra hours, it has the potential to save students a few hundred dollars each semester.
There are many options the administration could pursue as well. USC should follow in the footsteps of Williams College, which now offers free books for any student receiving financial aid. Obviously, that might not be the most feasible solution at this time, but USC could try negotiating with publishing companies directly, potentially saving students money on books. USC could also buy textbooks and revamp its rental system to make it more effective. Additionally, textbook costs could be built into tuition (which is currently not the case at most private schools), allowing grants to be applied to purchasing textbooks. Or, the university could subsidize the bookstore more, allowing the store to sell books for cheaper prices.
Most of those ideas, however, require more spending. One idea that would be free is creating “hyperlibraries” which, as a recent article in the Los Angeles Times describes, are “faculty writings, homework questions, research and other content available online that are then vetted, and, like a Wikipedia page, constantly expanded and adapted to meet specific needs.” These collections are currently being developed at UC Davis and could potentially replace traditional textbooks.
Until changes are made, however, students have a few options to help them save money. They can use price comparison websites such as SlugBooks. Students who do indeed buy books from sites they aren’t familiar with should be wary of potential scams, as well as receiving the books late. Kyle Pham, a freshman cognitive science major, experienced this firsthand.
“In an attempt to save money on a textbook, I rented it from a website I had never heard of before,” Pham said. “Yesterday, I received an e-mail telling me the shipment had been delayed, and now I have no idea when I’ll be getting the book.”
Another great resource is Amazon Student, which gives students free two-day shipping for six months.
Besides ordering textbooks online, students can find people who have already taken the class and buy the books from them. Teachers might also know of former students selling textbooks and can refer them to current ones.
The lesson that can be learned from this issue is that it is important to realize the impact that paying $1,200 on textbooks can have on a person. Hopefully, new innovative approaches will be taken and paying for overpriced textbooks will become a thing of the past.

Recently, major American brand companies, most notably Burger King and pharmaceutical company Mylan, have been able to avoid U.S. taxes through tax inversions. Brought under fire because of the recent news, tax inversions are best known as loopholes corporations use to avoid U.S. taxes by merging with foreign companies and shifting their headquarters abroad. The move is viewed as a corporate maneuver to boost profits as well as an unpatriotic strategy for brands closely tied to the United States.
Tax inversions from a corporate standpoint might seem like a fruitful venture. A company needs to boost profits and does not need taxes weighing it down. To avoid the exorbitant U.S. corporate tax rate, a company shifts its headquarters to another country and effectively avoid paying those U.S. taxes. The move ostensibly makes sense, but it masks the true issue at hand. The jettison of major American companies to avoid taxes speaks to the need to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate so companies do not leave, as well as boost and encourage new companies to set up shop right here in America. Tax inversion is just a feeble attempt by companies to avoid a larger issue that compels a nuanced and complex solution.
Burger King is the latest American company to utilize tax inversion. The Miami-based company announced two weeks ago that it would merge with Canadian-based doughnut and coffee juggernaut Tim Hortons. The idea of Burger King, one of the most recognizable American brands, forsaking its origin country for Canada speaks volumes.
When the sixth-largest fast food company in the world leaves because the tax rate is too high, that’s a cue to start having serious discussions about corporate tax reform. Tax inversions are a slippery slope, not the solution to a more complicated issue that needs attention. Once companies start to leave for tax purposes, who is to say that future startups won’t feel discouraged and base their headquarters elsewhere as well? For the corporate world, the practice of tax inversion is simply executing a fiduciary obligation to shareholders. The reality is that it sets a dangerous precedent for companies to dictate what taxes they wish to pay or not, and it disincentivizes entrepreneurship stateside.
Walgreens, the Deerfield, Illinois, drug retail chain, had plans to use tax inversion but abandoned those attempts after public outcry over the practice. Investors in the company became upset because a deal was completed without shifting the company overseas. This issue illustrates the strong divide and disparity between Wall Street and the public. Investors want to inflate their profits, while the public believes American companies should stay put. If Wall Street is so adamant on the practice of tax inversion, then it begs the question: If the roles were reversed and ordinary Americans used government money in the form of food stamps because they could not afford to purchase food, how would Wall Street respond? Investors and corporate executives simply cannot use methods that satisfy themselves and their profit margins.
In this tax inversion issue, the only thing that needs to be inverted is the logic behind abandoning your country to pay lower taxes — in Canada.

Early this semester, USC students received an email from Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett entitled “New Initiatives Against Sexual Misconduct for Fall 2014.” The memo was short and to the point, reassuring students that USC does “not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form” and listing new steps Student Affairs would be taking to address the issue.
Jennifer Frazin | Daily Trojan
What many students might not know is that incoming students received a second email from Provost Garrett, this one regarding a mandatory online training to follow up the also mandatory “Talk About It” session during Welcome Week. Both “Talk About It” and the online training, “Think About It,” were introduced by the university this year to combat previous violations of Title IX.
“Talk About It,” a 45-minute presentation, focused on informed consent, bystander responsibilities and campus resources for victims of sexual assault. The more comprehensive online training, which took about two hours to complete, included information on partying, sexual assault and healthy relationships.
Despite the comprehensiveness of the trainings, these initiatives still fall short of the necessary steps that must be taken to combat sexual assault on USC’s campus.
Daniel Yang, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, attended the “Talk About It” session during Welcome Week.
“The way that they presented their information wasn’t precise, and it was hard to pay attention. But at the same time, when we did tune in, it felt like they weren’t taking it as seriously as they should have,” Yang said. “A lot of information that comes to us as common sense, especially with the way it was taught in high school and even middle school. They didn’t really teach us anything new.”
“Talk About It” defined consent as being “conscious, affirmative, informed and unambiguous,” and also referred to a “stoplight system” for the levels of consent. This system, though, is not realistic to students in the situations proposed in the training.
“If you were in a situation like that, you wouldn’t say, ‘Oh, it’s a red light,’ or something like that,” said Peter Bergmann, a freshman majoring in economics and math.
That touches upon the most conspicuous shortcoming of “Talk About It.” Though the message itself was beneficial, the situations proposed were unrealistic to students. In fact, the phrases “red light,” “yellow light,” “green light” and “healthy threesome” have turned into jokes among freshmen students.
Some students are doubtful of the intent behind the programs. Yushi Wang, a freshman majoring in anthropology, worries that the administration is trying to mask the Title IX issue through these programs.
“It’s not really addressing the issues,” Wang said. “Programs like this, in general, address how we should handle being targeted as victims instead of addressing the people that are actually attacking or sexually abusing other people.”
USC’s attempt to address the issue is admirable, but there are certain flaws within the programs that need to be addressed in order for the efforts to be successful. Freshmen Madi Combs, a biomedical engineering student, proposed a change that could immediately affect the success of “Talk About It.”
“I definitely think it’d be better coming from other students, rather than the faculty and staff that were giving the presentations,” Combs said. “It makes it more personal, more relatable and I think people would pay more attention to it if it came from their level.”
Overall, the online training was more informational and more relatable to college students than the in-person presentation. “Think About It” is different from AlcoholEdu, the mandatory online training regarding drug and alcohol use in college, in that each page is monitored more closely to try to ensure that students are paying better attention.
As Bergmann points out, however, “It just depends on the mindset of the student going into it. If people aren’t willing to actually be open to it at all, it’s not going to be beneficial to them.”
One of the most serious issues with the new initiatives is that neither program addresses the problem that was brought to the nation’s attention in May: improper treatment of sexual assault accusations by the USC administration. Though both the in-person and online sessions mentioned resources for victims of sexual assault, and the online training does provide a copy of the university’s 2014-2015 policy on sexual misconduct, it will be up to the university to ensure that these new policies are actually implemented.
Students at USC deserve to have an enjoyable, safe and educational experience during their time here. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the administration — not the students — to ensure that USC upholds its promise of ensuring an emotionally and physically safe environment for all.
