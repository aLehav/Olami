Senior Ashley Daily’s hometown, Thousand Oaks, faced  two major crises earlier this month. 
On Nov. 8, she tragically learned that her friend Noel Sparks was one of the 12 people who died in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill. The next day, her family was told to evacuate as the Woolsey fire encroached on their community. However, her family  decided to stay
At first, Daily struggled to comprehend the tragedies that came one after another. 
“[I] just started screaming at God and saying, ‘Why is this happening? What good is supposed to come from this?’” said Daily, who is majoring in business administration. “And I felt this instant amount of peace, just felt the strength to continue going forward.” 
She was inspired to put design and sell wristbands to raise money for families affected by the shooting and wildfire. So far, Daily has raised $2,550 for both causes. 
Daily was inspired when she saw a bracelet in her home, and realized she could make and sell her own bracelets to garner donations. 
“I stayed up until four in the morning from Friday to Saturday just creating the bracelets and doing some market research, seeing what people would buy and then [I] put the link up on Saturday morning,” Daily said. “Originally, I was looking at thicker Livestrong-style bracelets and through texting my friends and asking what they would purchase, everyone wanted a thinner bracelet.”
Two bracelet designs honor Sparks and Ventura County sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, who was killed trying to stop the shooting. There is also an option to customize bracelets with loved ones’ names online.
Katia Ellati, a senior majoring in business administration and Daily’s friend, encouraged her own friends and family to buy the bracelets. 
“It’s been so beautiful, especially because she’s helping so many families that are mourning and also with the wildfires people have lost a lot of their homes, so this has given hope,” Ellati said. “I think she has done such a beautiful job with it, and it’s such an amazing idea.”
Stephanie Corrigan, a senior majoring in political science, said she is inspired by how Daily used her pain to help others. 
“It’s something so close to home, and she felt very helpless, and so it gave her an opportunity to actually do something about it,” said Corrigan, who was with Daily when she learned of Sparks’ death. “Even though it’s something small by some people’s standards, it can have huge repercussions because it’s raising awareness, getting a conversation and discussion going, and it’s keeping it alive and keeping it in people’s memories.” 
Daily said she plans to continue donating to families for as long as people show interest. 
She hopes the fundraiser provides hope for those affected by the tragedies. Since starting the fundraiser, Daily has received emails from friends and strangers thanking her for giving them a way to help. 
“I think that that was God’s [plan] for the whole thing,” Daily said. “He gave me the strength to push through and continue forward even though I was broken myself, so that the other people could feel like they’re not helpless in this situation.”

Gearing for the Games · USC is set to be a central hub during the Olympic Games in 2028. The Coliseum, Galen Center and Dedeaux Field will host sporting events and USC Village will serve as the Media Village. The Coliseum will also host the closing ceremony. (Daily Trojan File Photo)
Ten years from now — when the Olympic torch makes its way through the Coliseum for the third time in history — USC plans to be fully prepared. 
Since the International Olympic Committee announced that Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics last year, new construction plans have sprung up around campus, bringing everything from hotels to retail space for potential Olympic visitors. 
The thought of the University Park community changing drastically fills activist Rabeya Sen with a sense of dread.
“Who is this development going to be for?” said Sen, director of policy at the nonprofit Esperanza Community Housing. “Is it going to be for the people who [live here] or is it going to be for a whole new set of people who are coming in?”
USC’s ties to the Olympic Games run deep. 
Former President C. L. Max Nikias sat on the Board of Directors of LA 2024, the organization that ran L.A.’s bid for the Olympic Games, and the Undergraduate Student Government officially endorsed the bid in March 2017. 
This view appeared to reflect that of the majority of Angelenos. A Loyola Marymount University survey in July 2017 showed that 83 percent supported hosting the Olympics in Los Angeles. But in the months since, there has been growing opposition to the Olympics around campus; local activists and organizations worry that the Games could harm neighborhoods around USC.
In September, survey data from NOlympics LA — an organization that attempted to keep the Olympics out of Los Angeles — reported that 13 percent of L.A. County residents strongly support hosting the Olympics in L.A., while 24 percent are neutral and 45 percent oppose it. 
Daniel Durbin, director of the USC Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society, called these factors a “perfect storm” of urban problems that must be addressed before the Olympics can take place.
“Now you want to sink a huge amount of money into an event that ideally will bring more wealthy people over to buy a limited number of wealthy property,” Durbin said. “There are a lot of concerns in Los Angeles given the massive homelessness problem … and the continuing financial and other challenges for the city.”
An enticing promise
Current plans for L.A. 2028 include a large role for USC’s campus and the surrounding area. The  closing ceremony will take place at the Coliseum, which will also host various sporting events along with the Galen Center and Dedeaux Field. USC Village will also serve as official Media Village, housing journalists from around the world for the event. 
The Games have the potential to attract more tourists and businesses to the host city, Durbin said. Host cities typically use the Olympics as an incentive to better their current infrastructure and transportation systems to benefit visitors and residents. 
Dan Stimmler, vice president of auxiliary services and chief operating officer of the Coliseum said he thinks the 2028 Olympics will have positive effects on the surrounding community, providing jobs and volunteer positions for locals. The only potential problem Stimmler said he could think of would be increased traffic.
“We already have not just the competition venues, but we have the dorms for the media, we have the housing for the athletes already in place,” Stimmler said. “We have the hotels in downtown already in place … Everything that’s needed to host the Olympics, the main infrastructure, all [exists] currently.”
Durbin said the Olympics could create a global brand for Los Angeles, and make enough profit to fund improvements to infrastructure like transportation. But he explained that cities often pay more to the IOC to win the Olympic bid and prepare their city for the Olympics than they would ever bring in with tourism or infrastructure development. 
“Even a situation where in theory you’re going to have money coming in, you have to be willing to spend almost a limitless amount of money to fund the Olympics themselves,” Durbin said. “It is high-risk financial activity, and a lot of cities are concerned about putting themselves on the line for that.” 
It’s unclear which of these factors may have been at play for residents who responded to either survey, but according to NOlympics LA, the Olympics received positive feedback in the LMU poll largely because there was no “neutral” option for respondents with weaker opinions on the Olympics. 
NOlympics LA member and co-organizer Jonny Coleman said that respondents who didn’t have a strong opinion most likely answered the question positively.
“I think nothing polls that highly or that well. We were very skeptical of that,” Coleman said. “We feel like a lot of that … is people who were checked out or don’t care, but because they were given the binary support or oppose they picked one of them and maybe people err on the side of supporting things.”
A mobilized opposition
Organizations like Esperanza Community Housing, which partners with community members and organizations to promote affordable housing and equitable development in South L.A., believe the 2028 Olympics could displace South L.A. residents and increase gentrification in the area. 
“In this community that’s already experiencing these types of harm, what we fear with the Olympics coming in and the years between now and 2028 is more of the same, that it’s going to harm the community,” Sen said.
Sen worries that landlords or development companies might push out current residents to rent properties to visitors at higher rates during the Olympics. 
Looking at past Olympics, Strategic Actions for a Just Economy Executive Director Cynthia Strathmann said there has been a pattern of displacement for low-income communities. Over 70,000 residents were forced to relocate when Rio de Janeiro hosted the Games in 2016. What’s more, a 2007 report from the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions found that the Summer Olympics displaced over two million people and spurred real estate inflation around the world between the 1988 Seoul Games and the 2008 Beijing Games. 
Her organization is worried that Los Angeles could face similar problems.

“Most of the people we see are in housing crisis, so the Olympics are not the first thing on their mind because the Olympics are not the immediate cause of their housing issue,” Strathmann said. “We expect to see people becoming more and more concerned as development proceeds that displaces them unless there are strong measures taken to [avoid] that.”
Developments like The Fig Project could potentially displace residents on Flower Drive to make room for retail space, housing and a hotel. In May, the Los Angeles City Council approved a 1,153-room hotel complex across from the L.A. Convention Center called Fig + Pico to house visitors for the Olympics. 
While Strathmann hasn’t heard of other developments, SAJE expects there will be more construction and potential displacement leading up to 2028. The organization plans to continue its tenant clinics and, will work to make tenants more aware of the potential impacts the Olympics could have on their living situation. 
“We’re always working to educate and do outreach with tenants in the community, so that they know the rights they already have,” Strathmann said. “We also work with them to advocate for more rights so that they have more recourse when situations arise where they could be pushed out of their home.”
Still, the Olympics have faced successful opposition in the past. Coleman said Colorado residents and some politicians rallied against the 1976 Denver Olympics in 1972, and the city eventually declined the title of host city even after the IOC officially awarded it the bid. 
With 10 years left until the Olympics, Coleman said NOlympics LA hopes to educate Californians on the impact the Olympics could have on L.A. and thinks a potential ballot measure in a few years could lead to Californians ousting the Olympics from L.A. just as Colorado residents did in 1972.
“It’s just a contract — you can break it,” Coleman said. “We [exist] in a reality where anything is possible. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the next 10 years. I wouldn’t be doing it if I didn’t think we had a shot.”

The remnants of what USC’s season has been reduced to were ubiquitous after an embarrassing 34-27 loss to UCLA the Rose Bowl on Saturday. Above the tunnel that head coach Clay Helton walked through, USC fans waved him goodbye, yelled obscenities and held up signs calling for his firing. In the concourse, where Bruins fans — rejuvenated from a rivalry win despite a 3-8 record — chanted “Stay Clay Helton!” On Twitter, where a number of alumni voiced their displeasure — former Heisman trophy winner Matt Leinart simply tweeted, “Embarrassing.” During Helton’s postgame press conference, he was questioned repeatedly about his job security. 
What was supposed to be a season of promise to follow up a Rose Bowl win and Pac-12 Championship title has instead turned into a crusade to fire Helton. And if Saturday’s game, a crosstown matchup against a very beatable UCLA squad, was USC’s last stand to convince the powers that be to retain the head coach, then it failed. Miserably.
One could argue that regardless of Saturday’s result, Helton’s job was already in danger. But losing to UCLA in that fashion has to cross the proverbial red line. USC checked off all of the boxes on Saturday. 
Sloppy execution? Try watching freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ two interceptions — which were more pinpoint passes to UCLA cornerbacks than they were attempts to target a USC receiver — without gagging a little bit. 
Questionable play-calling? Ask Helton why, when USC had 2nd-and-1 from the UCLA 23-yard line, he dialed up consecutive end zone shots that fell incomplete, forcing a 42-yard field goal try that redshirt sophomore placekicker Michael Brown missed. 
Bonehead decisions? Someone explain what sophomore defensive lineman Brandon Pili was thinking when, on a third-and-goal play, he reared back and landed a full-throated, right hand punch to the helmet of UCLA’s Christaphany Murray. Instead of facing fourth-and-goal, the Bruins scored a touchdown with a fresh set of downs and went ahead 7-3 in the first quarter.
Check, check and check. 
Three points on the missed field goal, plus 4 points on Pili’s unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, totals 7 points. The final score: UCLA 34, USC 27. That, right there, is how you lose winnable games because of coaching, because of poor decisions, because somehow, someway, we are in the final week of the season and this team — loaded with talent up and down the roster — hasn’t figured out how to not shoot itself in the foot.
USC will more than likely end the season by taking a drubbing from undefeated Notre Dame on Saturday. It will not make a bowl game. It will finish at 5-7, below .500 for the first time since 2000, the year Daniels was born. Think about that.
By now, we’ve seen enough evidence: If Athletic Director Lynn Swann were to fire Helton, nobody would complain. The only question that remains is whether Swann and the rest of the administration want to undergo another coaching change. This is not a Steve Sarkisian-type situation. There is no doubt Helton is a good person, a players’ coach who has the support of the locker room and a strong relationship with his bosses. When asked if he had talked to Swann after Saturday’s loss, Helton responded confidently. 
“He just hugged my neck in there and said, ‘Coach, I’ll see you Monday. I’m looking forward to it,’” Helton said.
But one person did not make himself available to the media: Swann. After USC defeated Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship game last season, Swann held an impromptu session with reporters on the Levi’s Stadium field, expressing his confidence in Helton. 
On Saturday, he did no such thing. Even when Swann went on Trojans Live a few weeks ago — after Helton fired offensive line coach Neil Callaway and usurped play-calling duties from offensive coordinator Tee Martin — and threw his support behind Helton, vouching for stability over starting anew, he did not confirm that Helton would be the head coach beyond 2018.
Helton, when asked on Saturday if he knows he’ll return, didn’t really answer. 
“Out of honor and respect to [Swann], I’ll let you ask him that,” Helton said. “As I said earlier this week, I feel tremendous support from Mr. Swann and what we are doing him, and thank him for it because he’s been with me every step.” 
There’s a strong likelihood that the administration does not want to make a change. For three years, Helton has provided a semblance of stability by cleaning up the mess that Sarkisian left. And the last thing the administration wants, as it deals with a number of non-athletics scandals and searches for a new University president, is to hire a new football coach.
But a 5-7 season, in the eyes of USC supporters, is unacceptable. A loss to a 2-8 UCLA team is mind-boggling. The football program, right now, is an embarrassment. As much as the administration does not want to make a change — after Saturday’s performance — it is left with no choice.

Senior forward Leah Pruitt maintains control of the ball against UCLA. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
With penalty kicks even at 4-4 and a trip to the Elite Eight on the line, senior forward Leah Pruitt stepped up and shot the ball toward the left corner of the net. But Florida State goalie Caroline Jeffers dove and deflected it. Pruitt walked back to the line and hugged her teammates with tears in her eyes, even before Seminole midfielder Yujie Zhao netted the winning penalty kick that ended USC’s season. 
After double overtime failed to determine a winner following a 1-1 regulation score, No. 6 USC and No. 5 Florida State went into a shootout on Saturday afternoon in the Sweet Sixteen in Tallahassee, Florida. The Women of Troy struck first, and the Seminoles matched them to keep the count even, but FSU’s 5-4 victory in penalty kicks sealed the deal. The Women of Troy ended their season with a 17-2-3 record. 
“I thought you saw two fantastic teams battle it out all the way through, very similar to the fall except this time we had penalty kicks to deal with at the end,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I thought you could see the ebbs and flows in the game throughout, but both teams put it out there.”
It was a high intensity game from the beginning, as the Seminoles challenged the Trojans. Florida State dominated possession for most of the first half, but goaltending by sophomore Kaylie Collins helped the Trojans hold the Seminoles to a scoreless half. 
McAlpine said that there’s a reason why the coaches in the league voted her the best goalkeeper in the Pac-12. 
“You have to have a quality goalkeeping to advance at this time of the year,” McAlpine said. “Kaylie has been strong for us all year.”
USC got on the board first with a strike from freshman attacker Penelope Hocking in the 37th minute. Hocking drove the ball into the box and fired her shot over the head of the Seminole goalie into the upper-left corner. The Trojans took the 1-0 lead into the second half. 
“[Hocking is] just special,” McAlpine said. “She’s one of the most competitive people out there. There’s such thing as natural goal scorers — she is one of those people. She has that knack.”
The second half featured more balanced possession, with both teams fighting to post points up on the board. The Trojan midfield was on fire in the second half, challenging and intercepting balls from the Seminoles.
“Florida State possession is spectacular,” McAlpine said. “But we know we have a great tempo by which we play and it causes people problems. You got to see a little bit of that in the first half, they had it. [In the] second half we wore them down a little bit and were able to find a little bit more of the play.”
A goal from the Seminoles in the 64th minute equalized the score. Florida State attacker Dallas Dorosy sent a header into the back of the goal off of a Seminole corner kick. The Trojan defense and midfield set up scoring opportunities for its offense, posting a 9-6 shot advantage in the second half. However, the Seminoles put up a strong front and a 1-1 tie at the end of regulation, which pushed the game into overtime. 
With both teams fighting to post a goal, the nine-minute overtime was scoreless and catapulted the two teams into a double overtime. 
FSU dominated possession in the second overtime, but the Trojan defense did not give up, stopping all scoring opportunities. The Trojans created some offensive plays, but the second overtime ended scoreless, forcing penalty kicks to decide the winner. 
Pruitt’s missed kick resulted in a 5-4 tally in favor of the Seminoles, sending Florida State to the fourth round of the tournament. 
“We have to play the games that are in front of us,” McAlpine said after Sunday’s loss. “And today you got to see two teams that have been to College Cups, that have national championships, to understand what that is, play and battle. I just wish it was later, because it was awesome.”

Redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron looks at the basket and prepares to shoot against UC Riverside. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
The women’s basketball team continued its undefeated season with big wins over UC Santa Barbara, 82-39, on Thursday and Santa Clara, 77-46, Saturday. 
After a slow start on the road at Santa Barbara, the Women of Troy blew the game open in the second quarter, scoring 30 points to the Gauchos’ 13 and leading by 23 points at the half.
The Trojans defense secured the win in the second half by only giving up 3 points in the third quarter.
On a huge offensive night for USC, senior guard Aliyah Mazyck led all scorers with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting, with junior guard Minyon Moore adding 18 points. 
The Women of Troy improved to 4-0 while hosting Santa Clara Saturday, in a dominant 77-46 victory.
Redshirt freshman guard  Shalexxus Aaron led all scorers with 20 points, going 7-of-9 from the field and 5-of-6 from the 3-point line. Aaron credited her big shooting night to her teammates. 
“Once I hit a 3, I’m just feeding off their energy,” Aaron said. “It’s not just me, my teammates strive and get me the bucket. They’re giving me that pass and giving me that opportunity to knock down a 3.”
Mazyck was second in scoring with 14 points in only 21 minutes of action. She left the game in the third quarter with an apparent lower-leg injury, where she was fouled after hitting her first 3-pointer of the night. She left on crutches and did not return. Mazyck finished 6-of-10 from the field with five rebounds and five assists. 
Junior starting center Kayla Overbeck also left the game after a leg injury in the second quarter. Ja’Tavia Tapley, Cheyanne Wallace and Asiah Jones stepped in for Overbeck to provide an interior presence for the Trojans. Jones had 8 points, one block and three rebounds in 12 minutes of play. To step in for Overbeck, Jones emphasized preparation. 
“Coach just always tells me to be ready before anything,” Jones said. “So I just took the opportunity and I had to do what was best for the team.”
The Trojans got off to a hot start in the first quarter behind efficient 3-point shooting. Aaron, Minyon Moore and Mariya Moore all scored from beyond-the-arc in the first quarter. 
On the defensive side of the ball, USC’s intensity led to 11 first-half turnovers, and 22 overall. Wallace had a game-high three steals, along with five other Trojans who had at least one steal in the contest. 
Head coach Mark Trakh praised associate head coach and defensive coach Jason Glover.
“We just get after it defensively,” Trakh said. “We were very good tonight.” 
Aaron echoed Trakh’s sentiments.
“[We] take it one possession at a time,” Aaron said. “Minyon takes a charge, and then we feed off of that energy. We get a 30-second [shot clock violation], and we feed off of that energy.” 
The Women of Troy started the second half with an 11-0 run and didn’t look back.
“I just thought we played well,” Trakh said. “We did a good job defensively, a good job offensively and got some contributions as well.” 
Aaron finished the night with a 4-point play with less than two minutes left in the fourth quarter, giving the Trojans their biggest lead of the night with 31 points. The game ended 77-46 as they shot 50 percent from the field and 45 percent from the 3-point line. 
Guard Emily Wolph led the Broncos in scoring with 16 points in over 18 minutes.
USC heads to Reno, Nevada on Friday to compete in the Nugget Classic against Nevada and Utah State. Its next home game is Nov. 28 at 5 p.m. against Fresno State.

Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the second installment of the Harry Potter spin-off series. The movie released Friday and opened at $62.2 million in the box office. (Photo from IMDb)
“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the second release of  the Harry Potter prequel series, is a disappointing attempt at continuing the adventures of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his magical companions in 1920s London. 
This time, the group attempts to seek out and connect with Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who was revealed to be an Obscurial, a type of magical parasite produced by the repression of magical powers. The film follows Credence’s search for his family before dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) finds him. 
While the feature brings longtime Harry Potter fans back into the mystical universe, director David Yates leaves the audience jarred and disappointed with his cinematographic choices. 
Yates’ decision to focus on the relationship between Newt and his brother Theseus (Callum Turner)  affects the plot’s progression; their interaction is limited and unessential in terms of Newts’ journey to find Credence. There were awkward sequences in the British Ministry of Magic where Yates opted for close-ups on the faces of Newt and Theseus. The fast cuts jolt the audience’s view from one brother to another, creating a disconnect from the story.
Zoë Kravitz’s acting chops were tested in her role as Leta Lestrange, especially compared to  the ensemble’s veteran actors like Jude Law, Redmayne and Depp. Kravitz’s performance was lackluster, her blank expressions belying the emotions her character was supposed to feel. During an interaction with Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), the scene lacked the emotional intensity it demanded, as Lestrange was talking about her dead brother. 
Claudia Kim’s casting as human Nagini, Voldemort’s pet snake and Horcrux, was bizarre and detracted from the logicality of the plot. While the casting initially seemed like a great stride for diversity, Kim’s contribution was unimportant in terms of character development and involvement.
However, the film successfully gave the audience a message to think about. In writing this sequel for the big screen, author J.K. Rowling emphasizes the characters’ ability to choose which side they can stand on.  
Grindelwald speaks of how the Ministry has failed British wizards and witches, and emphasizes how the world will fall apart with Muggles in charge — showing them premonitions of a war that has not yet happened.
Many characters are baffled as to why Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) would join Grindelwald on the dark side, but all Queenie wants to do is marry the man that she loves, which is barred by the society she lives in. 
What Rowling shows time and time again is that love can drive people to do desperate, and
sometimes, dark things. It is also revealed that Dumbledore makes a blood pact with Grindelwald to not hurt or kill him, considering their romantic history.
While there were enough Easter eggs to keep Potter fans entertained, like cameos from Nicholas Flamel and a young Fawkes, this was not enough to overcome the film’s shortcomings.

“Oxnard” is Anderson .Paak’s third album and continues to explore the artist’s complex relationship with both the West Coast and the ocean. (Photo courtesy of Aftermath Entertainment)
Though 2018 has already been a year filled with noteworthy releases, Anderson .Paak’s “Oxnard” has immediately climbed to the top of the list and will definitely pose a challenge to artists looking to dethrone the rapper. The lovechild of funk and rap, “Oxnard” pairs psychedelic melodies with bold verses for an album that truly captures Anderson .Paak’s skilled musicianship. 
The 14 track album features some of the best artists in hip-hop including Kendrick Lamar, J.Cole, Pusha T, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. This is Anderson .Paak’s first release on Dr. Dre’s label, Aftermath Entertainment, and follows his 2016 album “Yes Lawd!” which was met with equal praise as previous albums. “Oxnard” features plenty of elements that fans have come to love, such as the seesaw between Paak’s raspy voice and his soulful side. He gives fans a multitude of beats to groove to, from the funky “Brother’s Keeper” to the more intense “Who R U?”
Named after his hometown, “Oxnard,” will be the final installment of his ocean-themed series. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the artist joked about how he has slowly moved up along the coast in his discography, referring to his previous albums “Venice” and “Malibu.”  
“This is the album I dreamed of making in high school, when I was listening to [Jay-Z]’s ‘The Blueprint,’ The Game’s ‘The Documentary,’ and [Kanye West’s] ‘The College Dropout,’” Paak  said.
Filled to the brim with instrumentals, “Oxnard” takes listeners on a journey that showcases Anderson .Paak’s versatility and musicality. The star-studded album leaves little room for reflection as each song keeps the listener engaged and wanting more. 
“Headlow” blends Norelle’s ethereal vocals with Anderson .Paak’s smooth R&B voice for an alluring, sensual sound. Paak changes the flow with a more political track “6 Summers,” opening with “Wait a minute! / Trump’s got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild / I hope she sip Mosca-, I hope she kiss senoritas and black gals / I hope her momma’s El Salv, I hope her poppa stick around, yeah.” The rapper switches off between an aggressive and slightly misogynistic tone in songs like “Sweet Chick” and a light and breezy tune in songs like “Cheers.” 
“Tints,” a single featuring Kendrick Lamar, is the album’s standout track. “Tints” emulates a carefree summer sound that would have made for the perfect summer anthem. The staccato, joyful production of the song is complemented with intoxicating melodies and Lamar’s commanding voice. 
“Anywhere,” a collaboration with Snoop Dogg, brings nostalgia to life with its slow tempo.
“On the East duckin’ Feds from a peephole / 1989, gangbangin’ was at it’s peak / This the beat that make me reminisce on G-Funk / Three summers before The Chronic hit the street,” Snoop Dogg raps in reference to living in Long Beach in the early 1990s. “Anywhere” cuts straight to “Trippy,” which continues the calming, youthful sound of the record and keeps the spirit of “Oxnard” high. 
As a whole, “Oxnard” showcases Anderson .Paak’s attempt at becoming a renaissance artist. He succeeds in many aspects, but fails to make a cohesive album. The variety of tones in the album makes for a unique listening experience but makes it difficult for the tracks to flow well at times. Despite its recent release, “Oxnard” may have arrived a little too late in the year for its summery sound. Though the reoccurring summer essence throughout the album is pleasant, it doesn’t fit a November release as well as it would a summer release. 
While it’s refreshing to see an artist come at an album from all angles, it takes a few listens to not be distracted by all of the elements going into the album. Regardless, “Oxnard” makes for a groovy album that will no doubt be noteworthy in Anderson .Paak’s career.

Oh, it was a very good year for music fans. A very, very good year. So good, in fact, that even if you hypothetically spent every waking minute listening to records, you still wouldn’t get to every single worthwhile release. Still, as a more casual music fan, I’ve stumbled upon more great music this year than my sensory input could allow, so I’d be remiss not to share some of my favorite records, moments and artists from the musical whirlwind in the past 11 months.
With hip-hop now serving as the cultural zeitgeist (I use that word completely unironically), most of the records and artists I mention come from that background. So don’t let old heads tell you hip-hop is dead, because we’ve barely scratched the surface of its potential. In fact, many young artists are making history in the genre as we speak.
Denzel Curry intellectualized the gritty, aggressive South Florida rap scene with his unmatched technical ability and witty lyricism. In a scene that has produced so many hard-hitting, mosh-inducing hits, South Florida lacked an artist who could produce truly great conceptual album. However, this changed with Curry’s “TA13OO,” an album that encapsulates the rapper’s songwriting prowess with sticky hooks and takes listeners on a sonic journey. He also gets a pass on the “Dragon Ball Z” hip-hop cliches. He’s genuine and, God, does he go Super Saiyan on this thing.
“TA13OO” collaborator and Baltimore rapper-producer JPEGMAFIA also released one of the most wild and weirdly enjoyable projects of the year on “Veteran.” His at-times edgelord personality and often bonkers production certainly doesn’t make him a casual listen with friends and loved ones, but the project will have you too saying “damn, Peggy!” if you lower your guard and let it take you off the walls. 
I truly believe mainstream hip-hop and trap hit a high-water mark this year. Rapper Cardi B delivered an impressive debut, especially as an artist some critics wrote off as a 
one-hit wonder. Pusha T absolutely smoked Drake and revitalized high stakes rap beef, only for Drake to drop a dud of an album that still shattered streaming records. Meanwhile, “Daytona” is up there for my favorite album of the year — it’s just over 21 minutes of pure mob boss adrenaline. But there were three captivating albums that deserve critical recognition and have more or less: Travis Scott’s “Astroworld,” Brockhampton’s “iridescence” and Kids See Ghosts’ self-titled debut.
Scott, much like Curry, has carried the torch in conceptualizing mainstream rap into an album format. Scott assembled “Rodeo” masterfully, with incredible hooks and orgasmic production switch-ups (yes, I mean that). “Astroworld,” however, may prove to be the most important album of Scott’s career. Despite being put under the media microscope as Kylie Jenner’s partner, Scott released a great album immune to deep criticism, complete with club-hopping singles and intriguing deep cuts.
I couldn’t write this column without shouting out Brockhampton. The hardest working boy band in America released an incredible follow-up to its “Saturation” trilogy, and, though my opinion on it has quelled since its release, “iridescence” is Brockhampton’s most important project to date. 
After expelling core member Ameer Vann earlier this year for lying about sexual abuse allegations, the group scrapped their tour and intended album, titled “Puppy,” and took time to regroup. “iridescence” is the product of this turmoil, and its as diverse, tortured and optimistic as the 13 young men who created it. 
“Kids See Ghosts,” named after the new supergroup formed by rapper-producers Kid Cudi and Kanye West, proved to be a redemption project for two artists who desperately needed one. On it, Cudi, after several disastrous attempts at psychedelic rock, returns to the introspective, tripped-out yet catchy brand of hip-hop. Meanwhile, West was in the midst of his own PR dilemma after infamously declaring his support for President Donald Trump among a series of public outbursts. However, on “Kids See Ghosts,” West and Cudi take the strokes of genius on the critically panned “ye” and amplify them for seven near-perfect tracks.
And, please, save your “rock is dead” chants for another year. Sure, the few new bands that crack the charts may not be the most original (looking at you, Greta Van Fleet), but there are myriad bands and artists who continue to carry the torch and deliver incredible, innovative rock music. They might just look, sound and feel a little different than your mom’s favorite bands on 98.3 The Ride (only on FM, obviously). In fact, two of the genre’s best projects this year focused on themes of depression, mental illness and queer relationships, a far, far cry from Scorpions’ “Rock You Like a Hurricane” or Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama.”
The first, Car Seat Headrest’s “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face),” explores a young man’s now-realized feelings toward a close friend and the relationship’s eventual demise — think indie rock’s answer to “Channel Orange.” Over the course of 71 minutes, songwriter and frontman Will Toledo smacks the listener upside the head with songs that are at-once structurally ambitious, emotionally potent and catchy as hell.
In the second, gender-bending songwriter Ezra Furman quietly delivered the best project of his career this year with “Transangelic Exodus.” The album’s narrative follows Furman’s love affair with an angel and how the two run away from home due to a government crackdown. It’s a symbolic, gritty and beautiful album that features some of Furman’s best songs to date. “Love You So Bad” is a total ballad, and I’ll be damned if you can show me more earnest and vivid songwriting this year.
I also must mention the young Euro-punkers IDLES and Iceage, each of whom released some genuinely rebellious and fun listens in a time when we sorely need them. IDLES’ unapologetic “IDGAF” attitude and musicality should certainly quell traditionalist jeers. And if that won’t, Iceage frontman Elias Bender Rønnenfelt’s charisma and songwriting chops will seduce you, guaranteed.
But again, hip-hop and R&B rule the land, and the relatively small population of stubborn, traditionalist rock fans should embrace them. There are so many creative people making incredible music in those fields right now, and it would be a damn shame for those people to miss out. 
Who knows what’s next? I certainly have no idea — I just try my best to sift through a tiny portion of the plethora of music at our disposal for something good. I’d be a damn liar to sit here and tell you I come even this (imagine something large, an elephant perhaps) close to catching every good record that came out this year. And with just over a month left, I guarantee that there’s going to be at least one more release that’ll blow our collective mind.
I have stumbled upon some excellent records so far, and I implore you to try the ones I just mentioned if you haven’t yet. You don’t have to listen to me — I’m no tastemaker by any means. But hey, if you’ve made it this far, from fan to fan, stream those right freaking now.

Despite being the cornerstone of USC’s educational platform, the General Education system is far from ideal. Though its goal is to provide students with a well-rounded education via exposure to various disciplines, the system sees no distinction between effectiveness and excessiveness. While we and much of the student body believe in the ultimate goals of the GE system, it is clear that these goals are not its defining characteristic and have been subjugated for the sake of increased University revenue. Forced enrollment in classes of various disciplines can be effective and beneficial, but only to an extent. This is not the first time students’ well-being has been compromised by USC’s image-conscious and financially greedy administration. 
Additional course requirements often increase the cost of education, but the GE program is in a league of its own. For incoming freshmen, extra-major course requirements typically include 10 GE courses, two writing courses and three language courses. These 14 typically required courses potentially reach a total of 56 units, or 44 percent of all courses taken as an undergraduate student. For context, many majors at USC are 48 units or less. Given standard USC tuition, these 56 units amount to a staggering $104,328 financial burden and over three full semesters of extra requirements that move students no closer to a degree or career.
The excessive number of required courses is not only a burden in itself, but also forces students to spend more time overall at USC, and limits their ability to pursue additional majors or minors. Most importantly, GE unit requirements make it extremely difficult for cost-conscious students to graduate early. This further limits students’ opportunities to pursue programs like coterminal master’s programs or even gain a head start on their career. Additionally, the ethics of having families pay for courses students are forced to pursue are questionable at best, especially given current tuition rates.
The GE system is also totally ambiguous in its categorical descriptions, which increases course requirements. Students are required to take two courses in humanistic inquiry and two courses in social analysis. Many of the classes could be categorically interchangeable, and students can seldom discern differences between the categories. If the University were to merge the two categories and require two courses in the one category, students would take eight fewer units at $1,863 per unit, thus decreasing the University’s revenue by $14,904 per student. Given an undergraduate enrollment of 20,000 students, the University is making $298,080,000 off of ambiguous course category and requirement descriptions.  
The GE system also cultivates disparate opportunities because of Advanced Placement access prior to college. Some requirements, such as quantitative reasoning and physical sciences, may be waived with AP or International Baccalaureate courses taken in high school. Students from lower-income neighborhoods and high schools typically have fewer AP or IB options than schools with a higher income average. Thus, upon matriculation with more requirements and less credits to pursue additional majors or minors. Though individual high school course offerings are out of the University’s control, with 60 percent of the 2018 freshman class having taken seven or more AP or IB courses in high school, disparities among course offerings give higher-income students an unfair advantage.
Despite all of these factors, the GE system could be potentially legitimate if its administrators stood firmly behind its stated goals and were dedicated to improving the system. Sadly, this could not be further from the truth. Associate Dean Richard Fliegel heads the entire program at USC, and should therefore be an embodiment of its stated goals. Yet, his public resume states that “…the G.E. program provides over thirty thousand seats and a hundred million dollars a year in gross tuition revenue.” 
This statement is the only one addressing the GE system on his resume, leading us to believe that its major function is monetary. It would seem that even the dean’s view of the GE program is as primarily a revenue-generating tool. 
In summary, the General Education Program and its resulting tuition requirements have far overshadowed its goals. To return to its roots, some major structural changes must be enacted. Drastically reducing the number of required GE courses, reworking GE categories and thus giving students more freedom of selection in courses would encourage students toward more academic and career-based success, rather than making students slave over unnecessary units. Finally, this reduction of units would allow USC to totally reject AP classes for GE credit, thus leveling the playing field for all incoming students regardless of economic access. If University administration does actually care about its students’ educational value more than increased revenue, changes may be in order. Unfortunately, it seems that this could not be further from the truth at this moment.

Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
In a remote stretch of Mason County, Washington, along the Olympic Peninsula, a breathtaking steel bridge vaults out of the forest. Standing at 347 feet tall and spanning a 422-foot expanse of evergreen trees, the Vance Creek Bridge is one of the tallest bridges in America, and its old-fashioned, arched steel silhouette is striking against the misty foothills. The bridge, retired by railroad companies in the late 1960s, was a place frozen in time, and its existence was a secret among locals and adventure seekers for several decades. Then Instagram happened. 
Images of the photogenic bridge began to flood my feed around 2012, as the Vance Creek Bridge went from community secret to tourist destination. Growing up about 30 minutes away, I remember Vance Creek fever sweeping through my high school as groups of kids would make the expedition there, take pictures and reap the rewards of likes and retweets. This wasn’t just a western Washington thing, either; as the bridge was featured on popular travel pages, tourists from all over the country and the world started to show up, according to representatives from Green Diamond Resource Company, the bridge’s owner. 
Today, more than 13,000 posts have been tagged #vancecreekbridge, most of which feature young people precariously balancing on the railroad ties. As a result, the bridge and surrounding area has been slowly destroyed by foot traffic, vandals and fires. Today, the bridge is a sad shell of its former glory; burnt-out boards, graffiti and trampled brush mark the area. 
The Vance Creek Bridge is my local example of an issue that public lands executives have been wrestling with for several years: What do you do when nature goes viral? Areas like Horseshoe Bend in Arizona and Kanarra Falls in Utah have met similar fates, drawing huge amounts of visitors who often deface the landmarks and cause major headaches for locals. As national park-level crowds start to descend on areas that don’t have national park-level planning and infrastructure, things can get out of hand quickly.
Social media already affects our culture, politics and habits, but Instagram hotspots show that it is affecting our planet as well. On the bright side, Americans are getting out into nature and visiting national parks more than ever, but this uptick in visitors also causes some sites to be overrun and disrespected by tourists who care more about getting the perfect shot than preserving the space for future generations. 
For decades, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics has maintained a framework of rules to enjoy the outdoors responsibly. They emphasize practices we’re all familiar with, such as only hiking on established trails, minimizing campfire impact, disposing of waste properly and respecting animal life. 
But in June 2018, the group added new guidelines for mindfully using social media in the wilderness. The key takeaways? Be mindful of what your images portray, give back to the lands you enjoy and, above all, stop geotagging specific locations.
The last one might seem like an odd conclusion, tagging the location of a cool nature shot seems like an innocent or even a charitable act, allowing others to find the same view that you did. But geotagging can go haywire, as it did at Vance Creek, and lead to overuse and degradation of the natural world. This is exactly what we don’t want. 
If you truly feel the need to add a GPS location to a photo, tag the general area or the state name and resist the urge to be specific. Remember that even if you are just going to a wild location for the pictures, you still hold some responsibility to be a steward of that land, especially if it is not part of an established park system. Weirdly, sometimes the most helpful thing that you can do is to keep exact locations a secret.
Additionally, taking a hard look at what behaviors and ethics your nature photos depict is important.
