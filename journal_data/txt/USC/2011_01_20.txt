The USC men’s basketball team made a triumphant return to the Galen Center, convincingly defeating Stanford 65-42 Thursday.
Coming off a pair of embarrassing road defeats last weekend at the hands of Oregon, who had lost its first four Pac-10 games, and Oregon State, who had lost its previous three Pac-10 games by a combined 50 points, the Trojans (11-8, 3-3) desperately needed a change of scenery.

Playing in front of their home fans for the first time since Jan. 9, the Trojans looked energized, starting the game on a 24-8 run, and led 37-22 by halftime.
The Trojans did not let up in the second half, extending their lead by as many as 34 points.
Defense was the key for the Trojans. Forty-two points was one more than the season-low for Stanford (10-7, 3-3). The Cardinal only made 22.2 percent of their shots, compared to 55.6 for USC. The Trojans also recorded eight blocks and outrebounded Stanford by eight.
“Defensively, we were great,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “Our team has to realize it is all about defense because we are not going to beat anyone offensively.”
Senior guard Marcus Simmons was again assigned the task of guarding the opponent’s best player, matching up against Stanford guard Jeremy Green. Simmons held Green to five points on two-for-nine shooting.
The Trojans were led by junior forward Nikola Vucevic, who had a game-high 20 points and nine rebounds. Junior guard Jio Fontan had 12 points and four assists, and senior forward Alex Stepheson added 10 points and 11 rebounds.
Thursday’s game was the first without freshman guard Bryce Jones, who announced that he plans to transfer.
With Jones unavailable, O’Neill used a seven-man rotation for most of the game. Senior guard Donte Smith and freshman forward Garrett Jackson both had six points off the bench.
“We did everything we did not do on the road,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “We were not discouraged by losing.”
With the game out of reach, freshman forward Curtis Washington played the last four minutes of the contest, the first time he entered a game since November. Walk-ons junior guard James Dunleavy, sophomore guard Daniel Munoz, junior guard Eric Strangis, and redshirt freshman Tyler Sugiyama also came off the bench for the first time in Pac-10 competition.
The Trojans next host California on Saturday at 8:00 p.m. The Bears are led by junior forward Harper Kamp, who averages 13.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. Junior guard Jorge Gutierrez contributes 12.2 points and a team-high four assists per contest.

The 45-person synthetic skating rink came complete with special skates to allow students to skate on the plastic surface, as well as fog and snow machines. Still, the warm weather seemed to throw students off.
“They should hand out free lemonade and sunscreen [instead of hot chocolate],” said Annie Lee, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering.

First Lady Michelle Obama encouraged college students to take advantage of opportunities to study abroad in China during a speech in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.
The speech, delivered in front of more than 1,000 students, was in support of the president’s “100,000 Strong” Initiative, a plan Obama announced during his 2009 China visit that is a national effort to greatly increase the number and diversity of Americans who are able to study in China through the promotion of programs and scholarships.

In her speech, the First Lady emphasized the importance of pursuing study opportunities in China by citing the key role young adults can play in shaping United States-China relations and expanding collaboration between the two nations on both regional and global issues.
“Studying in countries like China isn’t only about your prospects in the global marketplace,” she said. “It’s also about whether you can come together, and work together with them to make our world stronger. It’s about the friendships you make, the bonds of trust you establish and the image of America that you project to the rest of the world.”
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said sending American students abroad has tremendous national and global benefits, particularly with regard to the nation’s ties to China.
“The first lady is absolutely right,” he said. “The more American college students that spend time studying abroad, the more equipped our society is going to be to work in a global community in the years ahead. The good news around here is that USC is already one of the nation’s leaders in encouraging these types of efforts, and it would be nice to have some company.”
USC boasts an international office in Nanjing, China, two abroad programs run by the Office of Overseas Studies and 19 Chinese-related language programs offered by the USC U.S.-China Institute.
Clayton Dube, associate director of the U.S.-China Institute, said the university’s presence in China is particularly strong and has grown in recent years.
“We had 11 summer programs last year, and that doesn’t even include the ones that the U.S.-China Institute ran for teachers and students who served as ambassadors at the World Expo,” Dube said.
USC’s U.S.-China Institute organized more than 160 participants to serve at the World Expo in Shanghai last year, Dube said.
Nationally, the number of Americans who study in China has steadily increased in recent years, as well. Ten years ago, roughly 3,000 Americans studied in China, compared to about 14,000 who went in 2008 and roughly 20,000 in 2009, according to a paper Dube published last August.
In addition, the U.S. State Department sends more Americans to China for study abroad than to any other country, according to Ann Stock, assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs.
Schnur said USC students stand to benefit even further if students from across the country are able to take part in similar ventures.
“[Former] President [Steven B.] Sample and [President] C. L. Max Nikias have both made the strengthening of these ties an absolute priority for the university,” he said. “It can only be a good thing for USC students to take advantage of this experience if other students from other schools have similar opportunities as well.”
Alex Silkin, a sophomore majoring in computer science, who went on USC’s Beijing summer program last year, said his experience abroad helped him place his academics in a global context.
“I could see with my own eyes how Beijing … will shape the future of human civilization [but] my experiences in Asia also highlighted the problems of modern society,” he said. “[Studying in China] is not only an excellent way to learn a language and submerge oneself within a culture, but also broaden one’s knowledge about the state of the world.”
Of course Obama’s want Americans to study in China.  It offers a pure ideology of the socialist model Obama wants to have fully implemented in America by the end of 2012.  What better way to indoctrinate our students than to have them in the heart of the society that has waged class warfare and won.  There was a time when everyone dressed alike individuality could not be encouraged.  Thats the perfect world Obamas’ agenda is for America.
You really are the person who should study in China. Haven’t you heard people saying China is the heaven of Republican? A potential benefit of more American youth in China is that they may help China to have more freedom of speech and become more democratic, hopefully.

Bicyclists aren’t the only ones facing increased restrictions on campus roads.
At the same time as the Department of Public Safety is planning to deploy more electric carts, the university is working to enforce rules to help decrease traffic decongestion.
It’s electric · The first step to decongesting the traffic on campus is to have all vehicles register through their departments by the end of the year. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The Environmental Health and Safety department of Career and Protective Services is currently working to create a safety program to train people in the proper use of electric vehicles, and Ed Becker, executive director of Environmental Health & Safety, said preliminary measures are being taken to draft an on-campus safety policy that will attempt to educate and spread awareness about the rules of operating an electric vehicle.
“It’s something that is already happening, and what we need to do is adapt the rules to make sure that we can control the growth in carts. It’s [about] controlling access and controlling the number of vehicles,” Becker said.
Becker said there need to be ways to ensure that electric cart drivers obey the rules of the road and to discourage the idea that drivers can behave differently just because they are on campus.
“Electric vehicles [are] a convenient way to get around but in order to have them coexist with all the other forms of transportation on campus, we have to have a clear set of rules and people following rules,” Becker said.
Another concern being addressed is how to prevent unregistered carts from coming onto campus, which has the potential to cause unwanted congestion or danger to those on campus.
Mandating that all the vehicles have some sort of USC registration will discourage these unregistered vehicles on campus because drivers will be able to be identified and found if need be, Becker said.
“The first step is having [the vehicles] first registered through a department, Becker said. “Not all of them are registered now, but by the end of the year, we’re hoping to have a full inventory.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said employing a strategy to decrease the number of DPS cars on campus and instead rely more heavily on alternative forms of transportation.
“The fewer the cars, the better; it’s more effective for DPS to patrol the University Park Campus on foot, on bikes or on our three-wheeled electrical vehicles called T3s,” Carlisle said.
DPS currently has a total of 47 bikes, 18 T3s, three electric carts and 30 vehicles available for patrol, said DPS Chief Carey Drayton.
Carlisle said the Ford Explorers that DPS officers drive are practical for police patrolling off campus. On campus, however, electrical vehicles could increase DPS accessibility.
“Using T3s, riding a bike or walking makes our officers more accessible to students, faculty and staff because it encourages one-on-one contact,” he said. “It’s easier for students, faculty and staff to talk to us [when not in cars] and we want everyone to know us on a personal basis since we are in a public safety partnership.”
Kim Hasday, a junior majoring in communication, said that a more alleviated campus will make it easier to transport back and forth to class.
“When I’m walking to campus, sometimes it’s so congested that I have to leave extra time to navigate through the crowd,” she said. “So, any way to ease this traffic, I’m all in favor of.”

Through a new partnership, a group of USC students will be conducting research that will help voters form decisions about the potential candidates in the 2012 presidential election.
USC undergraduate students will act on behalf of Project Vote Smart, a non-profit, non-partisan voter education organization, providing information to the public about political candidates.
Project Vote Smart, which has organized similar internships with students at Oregon State University and the University of Arizona, has chosen to bring its internship program to USC and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics because they see room for growth, according to Kate McElroy, the director of the Political Courage Test for Project Vote Smart.
“USC and the Unruh institute are enthusiastic about what we’re doing,” McElroy said. “There’s this combination of all these young, brilliant minds and something is going to come up that will completely change how we look at things.”
Last spring, Project Vote Smart administrators visited USC along with other universities to find a new location for their project.
Dan Schnur, the director of the Unruh Institute, said Project Vote Smart decided to hold the program at USC because of the enthusiastic students.
“A lot of our students do typical political internships like working in governors’ offices,” Schnur said. “But the prospect of doing research that could have an impact on state or national campaigns really seemed to catch the attention of a lot of students.”
The new internship class has been well received by USC students with about 25 students enrolled, according to Schnur. The other class that engages in more ordinary political internships has between 40 and 50 students.
Art Auerbach, the internship coordinator for the Unruh Institute, and Bret VandenBos, a former USC student and internship associate at the Unruh Institute, oversee the students who will help determine which political issues are most important to Americans by researching national polling data, evaluating party platforms and looking at major media sources.
Each election year, the researchers at Project Vote Smart create a Political Courage Test for all federal, state and sometimes local candidates to assess where candidates fall on important issues.
The researchers then focus on the answers to about 12 questions they feel most critically affect the American public during the election year.
But only about 25 percent of the 1,400 candidates in each election year, return the test, McElroy said.
If a politician declines to answer the Political Courage Test, the USC interns will determine that candidate’s stance through research.
“When candidates take the test, it means something to us and to the American people,” McElroy said. “But if you don’t want to tell the people where you stand, we’re capable of researching and doing it for you.”
The students will be consolidating the information on potential 2012 presidential candidates so that Project Vote Smart can utilize the program VoteEasy.
VoteEasy is an interactive tool that asks individuals to answer the same 12 political questions to learn which federal, state or local candidates share their points of view, according to McElroy.
This easily accessible information will give citizens the knowledge they need to vote for candidates who hold the same beliefs, McElroy said.
“The entire population of USC could possibly swing an election if the students have the knowledge to vote and actually do it,” McElroy said.
Schnur agrees that USC students will benefit from Project Vote Smart.
“Fox will tell you one thing and MSNBC will tell you another,” Schnur said. “If you’re a politically-informed student whose trying to decide which candidate is closest to you, Vote Smart is the place you can go to find this information in a non-partisan way.”
Project Vote Smart, headquartered in Philipsburg, Mont., was started by Richard Kimball, a former member of the Arizona Legislature, in the early ’90s because he was unhappy with the current state of politics, according to McElroy.
“He decided that politics had disintegrated into mudslinging and none of the information that was being distributed to the masses was useful for understanding where candidates stood on issues,” McElroy said of her boss. “He wants to bring civility back into politics.”

This week’s news cycle has been dominated by Chinese Premier Hu Jintao’s four-day visit to the United States.
During his visit, Hu has held a series of meetings with President Barack Obama and other high-level policymakers, corporate titans and diplomats.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The visit’s climax came Wednesday night, when Obama hosted an official state dinner highlighted by honey and produce from the White House garden.
The visit was a major improvement from Hu’s last visit in 2006, when President George W. Bush declined to stage such a ceremony, which was seen by many as an insult.
Although it is never surprising for Congress to be up in arms about the week’s biggest news story, in this case the harsh words of some senators and representatives have been particularly unhelpful to American interests.
The visit, especially Wednesday’s dinner, has been controversial. Members of Congress were particularly outspoken critics of Obama’s cordial treatment of Hu, citing Chinese human rights violations and currency manipulation.
Despite the continuing repressiveness of China’s government, especially toward women, minorities and political opponents, the country remains the single most important potential American partner — and potential American enemy — in today’s world.
On any issue that is considered a major foreign policy priority, including Iran’s nuclear program, global trade, climate change and energy security, we can expect to accomplish very little without Chinese cooperation.
The converse is also true: At this point, it is a virtual certainty that if the United States and China agree on a policy, their combined strength can mobilize the rest of the world.
For example, though the two countries were primarily responsible for scuttling a potential climate change deal in Copenhagen in 2009, any agreement between the two would likely force all other countries into line.
The key to these achievements will be establishing a positive, productive relationship with China, a country whose government’s main concern is maintaining a positive image at home.
Respectful diplomacy can help us move toward common goals without threatening one-party rule; public condemnation, however, will force China to lash out at us to “save face.”
There is a second problem with Congress’ antics this week. Not only are they hurting our efforts to make progress on crucial international issues, they also stand virtually no chance of having an effect on the problems highlighted.
It is true that China’s human rights abuses are abhorrent, and that its artificially low currency makes it hard for American companies to export there.
But it is absurd to think that the United States can somehow bully China into fixing these problems with angry public pronouncements or by refusing to hold state dinners with Hu.
Those tactics might work in smaller, poorer countries that are dependent on the United States, but if anything, it is we who are dependent on the Chinese.
They own more than $1 trillion of our debt. Many of our largest companies depend on their cheap, productive labor.
Furthermore, their increasing success is providing a crucial new market for American goods; GM now sells more cars in China than it does here.
We simply do not have the leverage to force China’s hand on domestic issues without doing ourselves great harm.
In fact, the best way to encourage change in China is to allow it to keep happening.
Thirty years ago, China was a poor, closed society in which many people could scarcely relate to institutions we value highly, such as democracy, the free market and human rights.
The poverty rate has declined from 64 percent in 1981 to 10 percent in 2001. There are 117 Starbucks in Shanghai, and the government is fearing increasing pressure to reform from intrepid bloggers across the country.
As the Chinese have grown wealthier and gained more exposure to the West, they have more strongly demanded political change as well.
Congress should seek to encourage this trend rather than finding things to condemn.
I do not doubt that Congress is acting with the best intentions. This seems to be another case, though, in which stubborn insistence on principle has high potential costs and very low expected benefits.
If Congress has a problem with China, maybe in this case it would be better to say nothing at all.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Fridays. 
I think it is right time for the Chinese leaders to make efforts in human rights improvement, starting from more freedom of speech and less censored press. Their moronic ways to control Internet forms and other thought venues are only one example of CCP’s political in-confidence, that already harmed people’s creative thinking, and hindered the development of a citizen society. The time to make money from sweatshop has got to come to an end. 
Also, as a Chinese student, I can first hand testify that women and ethical minorities are treated fair and well in China, at least politically. It is the rebels and  political opponents that the government is ruthless toward, just because “they could.”
Please, there is a mistake in the very first sentence of the article.  It’s President Hu Jinato, not Premier Hu Jintao.  Titles are taken very seriously by the Chinese; maybe a little more time should have been invested into researching for this article.  The rest of it is not much better.
“It is true that China’s human rights abuses are abhorrent, and that its artificially low currency makes it hard for American companies to export there.”
Human rights: 
In the long term, improved human rights/more political liberty “may” benefit China. But the time is not ripe now. As a country that is still in its inchoate stage of development, its focus ought to be on economic development. And a strong hand at the helm serves an important, unifying role while the economic objective is being achieved. It would be unrealistic to expect China, after its modernizing experience of the last few decades, to shift from its economic preoccupation that has brought stunning results, to precipitate political reform that carries risks. 
This is not to say that human rights/political liberty are not important, but that freedom has inherent de-stabalizing effects which China has a nation cannot afford to endure at this stage. Human rights and freedom makes more sense when economic development and literacy have reached a considerable level.
With its large population, China is a country with a million wants and resentments. It need not apologize for the measured pace it has chosen for its human rights development.
I very much concur with you on the point that megaphone diplomacy is counterproductive. At the same time, it must also be noted that China has never on any occasion made any remarks about such American atrocities as the illegal wars the USA has waged against other sovereign nations (Iraq, Afghanistan), and the torturing of Iraqi prisoners. China is not in the habit of lecturing/hectoring other nations. The same cannot be said of the USA. 
On the issue of Chinese currency
“Many economists are skeptical that a revaluation of the yuan would generate more jobs in the US or lead to companies relocating production from China to the US. Indeed, a recent Yale University paper forecasts that the net effect of a revaluation on US output could go either way. Indeed, it could be slightly negative.” (from Straits Times, Singapore 10-04-2010)
So in this load of verbal nonsense your point is that it is fine for China to repress and oppress its own citizens, ethnic minorities, and religious sects in a way reminiscent of the Soviet Union because it wants to expand economically, and that the devaluation of the yuan is not such a big deal either (based on one quotation that you found)?  
I don’t really want to debunk so much stupidity at one time, but for one when you say “China has never on any occasion made any remarks about American atrocities as the illegal wars the USA has waged….” so on and so forth, you’re completely wrong.  Every year, when the US releases its annual human rights report on the nations of the world, which inevitably criticizes China, a few days later China releases its own report that criticizes the US for its shortcomings.  So yes, every year the Chinese government formally and publicly DOES bring up and condemn American “atrocities”.  Maybe you should do a tad bit of research and thinking before saying “never on any occasion”.

This past week, Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, the popular computer brand and the 56th largest company in terms of revenues in the world, announced that he would be taking an indefinite medical leave of absence. Jobs, 55, successfully recovered from pancreatic cancer in 2004, only to require a six-month leave of absence in the first half of 2009.
With a company that has grown to be as powerful and as large as Apple, is it likely investors will lose their faith in the company so easily? Fat chance.

Jobs, known for his hands-on approach and active participation in his company affairs, is considered by many to be the brains and brawn behind Apple’s success over the past decade. Jobs fuses his visionary marketing strategies with powerful and well-designed products.
Jobs announced his leave of absence in the wake of some of Apple’s most promising economic news: The company’s popular iPhone 4 is to be released on Verizon Wireless, ending a three-year contract which gave AT&T the exclusive right to market and sell the product.
This news put Apple stock on the rise once again, with the company’s stock reaching its highest point ever upon the market’s close last Friday, Jan. 14.
But with the news of Jobs’s medical leave, it is speculated that the company’s stocks are about to fall dramatically. Shortly after his announcement, Apple shares opened 6 percent lower on Wall Street on Tuesday. Though the shares recovered to close down 2.25 percent from the start of the day, many are concerned about the future of the company.
But Apple investors, employees and customers have no reason to worry. Jobs reshaped the company from the ground up, ultimately creating an infrastructure that is arguably capable of withstanding even the most disastrous of events, including the resignation of the company’s CEO.
Jobs built Apple with all the bells and whistles needed to keep the company healthy, even if he is not. The company is now in motion, and despite Jobs’ leave of absence, Apple appears to have so much momentum that it is doubtful it will slow down anytime soon. If for no other reason, Jobs’ empire will continue to move forward simply on inertia.

Tesla Boy
From Moscow to the Midwest, everyone seems to be talking about Tesla Boy. Stateside, the gossip is more whispers than shouts, but an increasingly buzzing chorus of them nonetheless.
Since the May 2010 release of the band’s debut LP Modern Thrills and the mass circulation of club-demolishing singles “Electric Lady” and “Liberating Soul,” the Russian trio has amassed a dedicated following in both European and American electronic music circles.
Boasting enough vintage synthesizers to score a Beverly Hills Cop sequel, and with an ear for melodic, pop songwriting that is rare in today’s computer-heavy genre, Tesla Boy pushes the concept of borrowed nostalgia to a new extreme. The reverberating drums, the analog arpeggios and front man Anton Sevidov’s mournful vocals don’t just mimic an era. They belong in it.
“It’s like a journey through your childhood,” Sevidov said, speaking from Thailand and recalling the seed of his fondness for the 1980s. “Like taking a look at things which you were inspired by in your childhood through the eyes of a 21st century man.”
With a degree in jazz piano, Sevidov, along with bassist Dima Midborn and newly recruited guitarist Poko Cox, sprung into adulthood amid Moscow’s pulsing club circuit, a scene that would have a notable hand in shaping Tesla Boy’s danceable grooves.
“My ex told me about Dima,” Sevidov said. “He was more into indie rock those days. We started clubbing, mixing with each other. Then we decided to write a few tracks.”
According to Sevidov, the band took its name from a WWII-era transformer vault in the ground floor of Sevidov’s old Stalinist apartment building. The intense waves of electricity that regularly rippled through the transformer pillars are jokingly alluded to as an influence on Sevidov’s musicianship.
Midborn, who cut his teeth playing guitar in a punk band before switching to bass for the more sultry Tesla Boy, would become the band’s principal songwriter during the recording of Modern Thrills, a homegrown yet unnerving process.
“Our first EP was quite successful, and we didn’t expect that,” Sevidov said. “Here in Russia, a lot of people waited for the album and they spoke about it too much. And we felt like sportsmen who had to jump higher than before.”
Modern Thrills was recorded and mixed at Sevidov’s home studio with an impressive lineup of Roland and Yamaha keyboards, as well as live beats from the band’s former drummer Boris Lifshitz. Both Sevidov and Midborn cite David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance” as having a profound influence on the sound of the record.
“The record is soaked with ’80s glitter and verve and at the same time, the lyrics, approach to the music and Bowie’s experiences from the ’70s make it more than pop candy for teens,” Midborn said.
Already a hot name in both the art rock and club scene of their native Russia, Tesla Boy’s exposure to the wider world rests largely on the blogosphere. The band’s work has already been remixed by the likes of ODahl and Cassia, and the band has recently offered its own reworkings of France’s Anoraak and Sweden’s Sally Shapiro.
“It couldn’t happen ten years ago,” Sevidov said. “People all over the world can listen to our music. It’s an absolutely amazing thing.”
A smash in their homeland, the band’s international tour schedule was decidedly modest during their early days, only taking off in the recent months amid the success of their LP.
“Mostly we went to some city or town for the weekend and played there,” Midborn said. “Every show was great and people were going mad whether it was a small venue or a festival.”
Ironically, the notable lack of chart-topping acts from Russia might have played a key part in Tesla Boy’s international explosion.
“The 4/4 beat is still alive like it was thirty years ago, but I think Tesla Boy is something mysterious and new for Europe,” Sevidov said. “The band from the East with Western music and attitude.”
As for America, Tesla Boy currently has its sights set on a string of visits for late spring, following a Scandinavian tour and some recording sessions. Los Angeles is high on its list of desired destinations.
“On the road I’m either asleep or drunk,” said Midborn. “But we’ll keep it up for 2011, so beware!”
Please come to Atlanta…
I really do hope they add San Francisco to their list…. the ’80s are alive and well in many clubs here!

Brannon Braga, writer and executive producer of the upcoming television series Terra Nova, which is about people who travel back in time, recently said that his show was not really science fiction, even claiming that it has less science fiction elements than the earlier seasons of Lost.
Brannon Braga | Creative Commons
Really? A television series about people from the future who travel to a human colony in the prehistoric era? A series whose executive producer, Steven Spielberg, is responsible for some of the biggest science fiction movies of all time?
And coming from Braga himself, who was an executive producer for Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Enterprise and the short lived sci-fi series Threshold and Flashforward.
Oh, Terra Nova’s totally not a science fiction TV series.
This odd attempt to play down the science fiction elements of a show is nothing new in the television world.
For years, the producers of Lost denied that it was a science fiction program. It wasn’t until the fifth season, when the elements became too obvious to veil, that the producers admitted that the show had ventured into sci-fi territory.
In response to the recent arguments about Terra Nova, Lost producer Damon Lindelof tweeted a revealing message.
“Sigh. I remember when we denied being a sci-fi show, too.”
It seems that these attempts to downplay or dispel any notion of a show containing science fiction elements are purely to attract a wider audience, as if the very idea of a show being science fiction is a mass deterrent. The growing number of shows denying the genre indicate that something about sci-fi does not sit well with those who work on the show, despite an overtly sci-fi subject.
Many creators are afraid that audiences will simply see an ad for their show and lump it among generic sci-fi. One problem many viewers and creators have is that they associate science fiction with the typical image of lasers, spaceships, aliens and other Star Trek/Star Wars-esque tropes, ignoring any other possibility for a sci-fi story. For some reason, Braga is afraid of Terra Nova being seen as just that. 
For some reason, any show dealing with science fiction, fantasy or anything supernatural or speculative is filed under the sci-fi label. It’s a somewhat demeaning term, crowding all of those shows together. Is The X-Files the same show as Stargate: SG-1? No. Why, then, are they both put under the banner of genre TV?
This fear and marginalization of “genre” shows seems to miss out on what science fiction does and why it’s popular in the first place. At its best, science fiction takes its protagonists into unfamiliar situations beyond the perceived normal, isolating the person and delving into what makes the human mind tick.
The seminal science fiction writer Isaac Asimov summed up science fiction’s potential rather well in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction: “Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today — but the core of science fiction, its essence, the concept around which it revolves, has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all.”
What’s most perplexing about rejecting the sci-fi genre is that, at the same time, there are so many shows that are embracing their science fiction or fantasy elements.
Fringe, now in its third season, is based entirely on bizarre and fictional science elements. Other shows like V and the soon to be released Falling Skies, also produced by Spielberg, are based on the premise of an alien invasion. True Blood is one of the biggest shows on cable, and what is it about? Vampires and werewolves. And it’s still going strong even after the Twilight backlash kicked in.
Producers should not be afraid of the science fiction label. The success of some of these science fiction-embracing shows proves that audiences are open to a wider range of television than one might suspect.
Unfortunately, networks and television stations today do not appear to realize that. The disdain for “genre shows,” shows that are grounded in the fundamental tenents of their genre, is an odd bit of obliviousness, considering how many shows on the air today could be labeled as stale byproducts of their genre.
Right now there are innumerable television shows that fit neatly into one genre. There are reality shows, sitcoms, dramas, horror stories, “docu-soaps” and enough medical and police procedurals to drive a person mad.
That a show must deny its identity to today’s audience makes no sense.
How Terra Nova fares will depend on its acting, scripts and production, not its existence as a science fiction show. It’s time for those behind the wheel to realize that.
Nicholas Slayton is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. His column, “Age of the Geek,” runs Fridays. 
Firefly, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Dollhouse. I guess that TV executives have realized that geeks are too intelligent to market to.
I like that the blame for poor returns on investments in television, and movies, is placed at the feet of “genre” rather than, say, mediocre ideas poorly executed or using casts that are photogenic but incapable of acting.
FlashForward was based on my novel of the same name, and I was a scriptwriter and consultant on the series. I can tell you from experience that those working on genre shows receive strict instructions from the network marketing department about how a show is to be positioned in interviews.
Americans are so quick to judge, it’s not surprising we’d make snap judgments about TV shows (and books, for that matter). I never thought I’d like a “science fiction” novel; I typically read Tolstoy, Dickens, Wharton, etc. And then I read an Orson Scott Card book that I had such meaning, and my mind was changed forever. Don’t let yourself be limited by what you think you know!
I thought Rod Serling demonstrated the viability and mainstream capabilities of science fiction decades ago with The Twilight Zone?
Fringe is pure science fiction and look what’s happened to it.  A brilliant show that is in danger of cancellation.  (Watch it tonight, folks!)
IMHO, shows like Bones and CSI contain more science fiction than the first season of Lost
Couldn’t have put it better myself,Nick.

Few have heard of The Murder and the Harlot, a heavy metal band from New Jersey, but their debut album These Hands Wrote the Bastard In Me might just be the key as to why.
The new album contains nine tracks, half of which tend to blend together in a mash-up of screaming and forgettable guitar riffs. The first half fails in establishing a unique sound for the band, but the second half redeems the album’s shortcomings.
Mixed results · The band creates tracks that reel in the listener but fail to stick to a formula and alienates its non-metal audience members. -  Photo courtesy of The Muse Box  
The biggest issue in the first few tracks is lead singer (and screamer) Kenny Ramirez. Heavy metal applauds guttural screaming, however, why must it be so difficult to understand the lyrics? “The Graveyard Shift” contains some of the album’s most interesting poetry, but the words fall victim to Ramirez’s incoherent roaring.
The lyrics only become audible after they have been repeated several times. Throughout the album, The Murder and the Harlot seem especially partial to drilling its most poignant lyrics. In “The Difference Between,” half the song is a recycling of two basic lines: It’s like I’m drowning / As you keep swimming away.
The album ends on a decent note with “Realization: Answers” and “Porcelain,” both of which seem to work because of the incorporation of metal screaming and more traditional singing. The mix is done extremely well and could have functioned as a signature trait in some of the earlier songs on the album, particularly in the forgettable “Hey Man” and “The Graveyard Shift.”
Considering These Hands Wrote the Bastard In Me is the band’s first record, such a mix throughout the tracks would have likely worked to reach a more widespread audience.
In the last track, “Porcelain,” The Murder and the Harlot utilizes repetition in an emotional confession. The song begins with a forgettable guitar riff and, once again, Ramirez’s too-difficult-to-comprehend shouting. The chorus, however, contains that key combination of singing and screaming. It’s both catchy and hardcore.
Halfway through the song, the instruments suddenly shift to a softer rhythm and the singing falls into a haunting melody, eventually leading to some wonderful closure for the repetitive but far from forgettable song as the melody croons, I lost it all / Let these nightmares get the best of me.
There’s no contest when it comes to choosing the best song on the album. “The Difference Between” begins with a beautifully crafted combination of guitar and voice and Ramirez’s vocals are crisp and fresh. The song doesn’t lose the emotional feel of heavy metal, which is impressive considering the song’s instruments are significantly dimmed down in order to let the vocals stand on their own.
The biggest setback of “The Difference Between” is its short length. This is the song that should be downloaded, whether you’re a heavy metal enthusiast or not. It has enough singing to be considered more alternative than hardcore without alienating new listeners, unlike the first half of the album.
In the end, The Murder and the Harlot has produced a passable debut album. But without distinguishable lyrics, openings or melodies, it falls into a common trap, lacking the ability to appeal to a wider audience and the skill of being truly memorable. Even the songs that contain catchier choruses and more interesting melodies are often overshadowed by too-similar openings and Ramirez’s consistently confusing yelling.
Since only half of These Hands Wrote the Bastard In Me is worth listening to, The Murder and the Harlot should probably reconsider its priorities the next time it releases an album.

Bugs are all around us ­— while we walk to class, eat dinner and even while we sleep — yet we often overlook their potential beauty.
Bugs!, an IMAX film, currently playing at the California Science Center, offers viewers a remarkable glimpse into the world of Amazonian insects. 
Insect-haters, fear not. The makers of Bugs! capture the lives of insects in a style that evokes beauty instead of causing nausea.
The film opens by showing the legs of a giant centipede as it winds its way up a tree. In reality, the centipede is no longer than the average index finger, but the cameras focus so closely that each leg takes on a life of its own. The use of macro photography throughout the film is remarkable and transforms revolting insects into captivating creatures.
Bugs! doesn’t boast a cast of A-list actors or multi-million dollar special effects, but it is not without its triumphs.
The film follows Papilio, a young caterpillar from the mean streets of the Amazon as he braves the odds of being a small bug in a big forest.
Inclement weather and lurking predators are no match for our young hero, and right before our eyes, Papilio transforms into an elegant butterfly.
On the other side of the jungle, Hierodula the mantis must make a name for himself. From trying to attract a mate to escaping the clutches of a vicious iguana, the obstacles are plentiful.
One of the film’s most striking scenes features Hierodula stalking a fly, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. In stunning 3-D and with the help of high-speed film, the hunt for a fly becomes as exhilarating as any Hollywood human fight sequence.
If watching insects endure the circle of life doesn’t do much for you, the sultry voice of Judi Dench narrating the film is enough to make you rush out and catch the next show.
An upbeat, jazzy score also helps to create a rousing portrayal of the smallest of creatures in the biggest of jungles. Large beetles make tracks across a sandy patch to samba-driven jazz, while horns blare triumphantly as they catch their prey.
Bugs! has all the trappings of a Hollywood movie. It is scary yet tranquil, raunchy yet endearing and emerges as a potent celebration of life and a sad rumination on death.
For a student-discounted price of only $6, it is hard to believe that more students haven’t already taken advantage of Bugs! and other offerings at the California Science Center’s IMAX theater.
As if the financial incentive were not enough, the center offers its viewers a unique aesthetic experience, not to be found at the weathered movie house of the University Village or at L.A. Live’s multiplex sprawl.
The average age of viewers in attendance might  be close to seven, but one can think of Bugs! as an opportunity to recapture youth.
Just sit back, relax and let Dench’s captivating voice waft over you as you become engulfed in a world so tiny, only the scale of a giant IMAX screen could do it justice.

The rumors surrounding the unveiling of Coachella’s 2011 lineup were particularly enticing this year, not to mention backed by some feasible evidence. Among the whispered possibilities were an evening appearance by Neil Young, a headlining set by Daft Punk, and even a $5 million deal with The Rolling Stones to close out Sunday night.
Instead, the festival’s confirmed lineup – announced on Tuesday night – has been received dubiously within the media and the festival’s online message boards.

Kings of Leon will kick off the event on Friday night, with Arcade Fire headlining Saturday’s bill, and Kanye West finishing the festival on Sunday night – provided he doesn’t pull a Bonnaroo and decides to show up on time. Duran Duran, a newly reunited The Strokes, and Animal Collective will also perform.
Although Coachella has never been a headliner-centric festival, the 2011 bill is surprisingly underwhelming. Since their return to live shows at  2010’s Lollapalooza, both Arcade Fire and The Strokes were long pegged for an April appearance in Indio. Kings of Leon, after headlining nearly every 2010 festival in the world, were not only suspected but also dreaded by many as a likely headliner.
Even the staggering list of supporting acts – including Bright Eyes, Cut Copy, The National and Empire of the Sun – is notably lacking in surprises. There are a few impressive grabs to be found, such as European-sensation Robyn, Mount Kimbie and a reunited Death From Above 1979. But there is little here to rival the “WOW” factor of previous lineups.
Some may argue that the point of Coachella is embracing the future of music, regardless of prior prestige. Fair enough, but one can certainly set trends while also hauling out a few of the industry’s most impressive dinosaurs for fans. 2008’s late inclusion of Prince amid a mostly contemporary lineup was one such instance of generational appeasement that is still raved about by festival regulars.
Even the 2010 appearances by the more modern Thom Yorke and Fever Ray were unique treats for contemporary music fans. To this day, few people can boast of having seen The Knife or Atoms For Peace in concert, whereas most of the bands on the 2011 poster have been through the United States in the past year, some more than once.
Whether this notable cutback in special names is due to a tight budget or more sinister motivations, one can only hope that event promoter Goldenvoice has a few tricks up its sleeve for April. If any United States festival has repeatedly proved itself capable of pulling off the impossible, throwing together a biblical-sized, three day party worthy of flying from Germany or Australia for, it’s Coachella.

﻿Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Washington D.C. on Wednesday. The official state visit, which featured an illustrious opening ceremony and a one-hour press conference, is appearing to be a sign of friendship or at the very least mutual understanding.
Obama previously met with President Hu in 2009 at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China. | Creative Commons
The visit has yet to produce a real tangible measure of progress, but a warming of the hearts does appear to be taking place. President Obama and President Hu made difinitive statements acknowledging both the interests and challenges that the United States and China will share in the future.
For instance, both Obama and Hu declared that their countries will shoulder increasingly common responsibilities, such as nonproliferation, energy efficiency and terrorism in order to maintain stability within the international system.
The topic that fostered the highest degree of commonality was business. Both Presidents happily expressed their commitment to establishing a peaceful bilateral trade, an economic and investment relationship that follows a ‘win-win strategy’ for both countries. Both Presidents also cited figures highlighting how the U.S. and China benefit from open trade and markets. (The U.S. exports $100 million worth of goods to China, $380 billion in formal trade.)
Some may view the visit as merely a staged and practiced recitation of lofty goals. But those who follow this interpretation ignore the power of personal relationships in the vast and confusing arena of international diplomacy.
At the very least, it appears President Obama and President Hu are becoming trustworthy counterparts.

It has been three long years since Yellowcard released any new music, but the band has finally returned.
With the new album, When You’re Through Thinking, Say Yes, due to be in stores on March 22, Yellowcard released its first single, “For You, and Your Denial” on iTunes this past Tuesday.

The single reached #1 on iTunes’ Alternative chart in just 24 hours and has continued to climb the charts around the world. It is also being streamed on their AbsolutePunk and Myspace profiles.
After starting off with a beautifully intricate violin solo, “For You” takes off into a song filled with driven guitar rhythms as their infamous violinist, Sean Mackin, continues to float above. During the writing process, the band wanted to make sure they were concentrated on the future. Just one line from “For You,”  If it’s the past you love/then that’s where you can stay, illustrates that goal.
Refreshed from their break, the band is back with new energy. Their classic alternative/pop-punk sound is still present and ready to come back to life.
“We are really excited to finally give you some music and get this whole thing started,” they expressed to their fans on yellowcardrock.com.
Other tracks on their upcoming album include, “The Sound of You and Me,” “Be the Young” and “See Me Smiling.”
Itching to play a high energy show for their loyal fans, Yellowcard will be on All Time Low’s “The Dirty Work Tour,” along with Hey Monday and The Summer Set.
Reminds me of my good old days as a kid, as that was when I first heard Yellowcard. They will always be my favorite band. I’m excited for this album release (and I never get excited about album releases)

Deadline Hollywood reported Wednesday that director Christopher Nolan has chosen the villains for the latest installment in his interpretation of the Batman series, The Dark Knight Rises.
Christian Bale’s dark, moody Bruce Wayne will spend his nights fighting Bane and Catwoman, who will be played by Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway respectively.

Hardy was rumored to have already been tapped for a role as a villain in the film, though some may be surprised at Nolan’s choice for Bane, a beefy thug pumped with what can only be described as plant steroids. The last big-screen appearance the character had was in Joel Shumacher’s 1997 Batman & Robin.
It will be interesting, however, to see how Hathaway will fare as the sensual and slinky Catwoman, who was last played by a supple and sassy Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton’s 1992 Batman Returns. Hathaway is completely foreign to the world of action and as someone who has spent her last couple of roles in serious independent films, it will be interesting to see her in a catsuit spitting out one-liners.
The script will be written by both Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, with David S. Goyer crafting the story and Bob Kane creating the characters.
According to IMDB.com, The Dark Knight Rises will be released in the summer of 2012.

USC has begun searching for new neuroscience faculty to expand the program, responding to exceptionally high student interest and the increased demand for research in the field.
Brain power · Fifth-year neuroscience graduate student Farhan Baluch works on his doctorate project about biomechanics, programming the brain of a locust to be able to use it for other purposes, such as sonar. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan 
Under Provost Elizabeth Garrett, the university has formed a committee that will not only work to add more classes and research facilities, but will also define what to look for when choosing new faculty in the neurosciences.
“Our hope is that these transformational hires will have a kind of multiplying effect on the strengths and quality of the research and education that we have to offer here at USC,” said Pat Levitt, chair of the cell and neurobiology department.
Because neuroscience is a diverse field touching on law, psychology, chemistry, cinema and engineering, the initiative will be university-wide, Levitt said.
New classes will be added depending on the various specialties of the new faculty. Michael Quick, executive vice provost, said that the committee is looking beyond credentials and into collaborative efforts.
“Of course they will have a vigorous research agenda, have a strong history of training the next generation of scientists and be excellent teachers,” Quick wrote. “But they will [have] that extra something that says that when they come to USC they will catalyze a lot of collaboration and activity across all our campuses.”
Students will directly benefit from such expansion, as new courses will be added to answer increased demand, Quick said.
“We started it only a few years ago and … the major … [now has something like 400 or 500 [students],” Quick wrote.
For undergraduates, the initiative means new and more interdisciplinary courses, as well as new research laboratories in which they can perform research.
Levitt said that freshmen and sophomores will be able to immediately reap the benefits of hiring new faculty.
For graduate students, numbering a little more than 100, the presence of world-class neuroscientists and research facilities is extremely attractive, Quick wrote.
Lauren Klosinski, a graduate student in neuroscience, who graduated from USC last May with a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience, agrees that faculty who are involved in more than just neuroscience is crucial to furthering the program .
“As an undergraduate, I felt like we needed fresh faces,” Klosinski said. “USC neuroscience is pretty good at being comprehensive. Because it’s so interdisciplinary, you need to know a lot, but also a little [in your specific field] to be able to translate across many fields.”
In addition to new faculty, Garrett is looking specifically for growth in the area of neuroimaging, such as the use of various brain-imaging techniques to image brain structure and function, because it will provide opportunities to do experiments on humans.
“We are going to learn a lot about the human brain in the next few years and neuroimaging will lead the way,” Quick wrote.
The committee, which has one meeting in January and two more in February, is committed to beginning the hiring process this academic year. Jump starting the process this year will have significant benefits for both current and prospective students.
“We’re looking for world-changers,” Levitt said. “We’re looking for faculty who are doing research and educating in a twenty-first century way.”

USC and Entercom Communications reached an agreement Tuesday to convert KDFC, the only radio station devoted to classical music in the Bay Area, into a commercial-free station.
KDFC, which received the National Award for America’s best classical station twice, will broadcast on 90.3 and 89.9, stations that USC purchased from the University of San Francisco and the Howell Mountain Broadcasting Company.
USC decided to purchase the two radio waves to more directly connect with alumni and prospective students in the Bay Area.
“There are a lot of Trojans in the Bay Area,” said Brenda Barnes, the president of USC Radio. “USC wanted to have a more tangible presence in an area that is so important for alumni and perspective students.”
The goal of the agreement with Entercom Communications, one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in the country with more than 110 stations, is to ensure the availability of the radio station to listeners throughout the Bay Area.
“By going non-commercial, we are much better positioned to make certain that the Bay Area has a strong and vital classical music presence going forward,” Barnes said.
According to Barnes, the transition to become commercial-free was based on the effectiveness of the public radio model that other classical radio stations across the country adopted.
“If you look across the country, classical radio has been transitioning from commercial to the non-commercial model,” Barnes said. “It’s a trend partly because the financial models for public radio is that listeners that like the music make contributions and support it, and it is more effective than the advertising driven model.”
KDFC will continue to use the same on-air personalities and Entercom Communications will turn KDFC’s current 102.1 station into a classic rock station.
More than 700,000 listen to KDFC, and coverage of the station will be available in San Francisco, Napa and Sonoma Counties and Northern East Bay, as well as on the Internet and through iTunes.
Wow, no mention whatsoever of  the controversy about USC stealing the Bay Area’s beloved KUSF.  How about doing a story about that.  I think the USC students would be interested to know the evil things their University is doing in distant cities.  Or maybe the Daily Trojan isn’t allowed to report on anything that might paint USC in a negative light.  Just imagine if a SF school came to LA and bought your college radio station.  Shame USC and the Daily Trojan.
I’m happy to hear that KUSC was able to add a Bay Area node to its transmitter network but I’m deeply saddened that it was at the cost of freeform radio KUSF. It seems that the transaction was carried out largely in secret and that the volunteer staff were caught completely off-guard when the station was forced off the air.

More than 800 students are participating in the Spring Interfraternity Council Recruitment, a 20 percent increase compared to last spring’s numbers, according to Hayden Wheatley, vice president of recruitment for IFC.
“This is a tremendous turn-out and a huge increase from last year,” Wheatley said. “Our message is about building better academics while getting a more complete college experience, and it looks like people are responding well to it.”
The number of students participating in spring rush has increased each year since 2008, but according to Pedro Moura, IFC vice president of public relations, the increase is not because of ramped up recruiting by the IFC.
“We let our fraternities sell themselves,” Moura said.
Last spring, the fraternities gave out 293 bids, three more than the 2009 spring rush. In spring of 2008, 245 fraternity bids were given to students. IFC is hopeful the number of bids handed out during this rush will continue to increase.
“I’m confident that with the new houses and changes in the Greek Row that we will be able to break that 300 threshold this spring,” Wheatley said.
Though spring rush almost always has lower numbers than fall rush, Wheatley said choosing when to rush is an important decision that should be carefully considered by each potential new member.
“There are definitely people who come in during the fall knowing that the Greek community is a place for them, but there are some people who aren’t as confident where they stand within the Greek community,” Wheatley said. “Having rush during the fall and spring gives those students that avenue.”
Richard Tomlinson, Pi Kappa Alpha’s rush chair, said his fraternity utilizes the same methods to attract potential fraternity members whether they rush in the fall or in the spring.
“We try to reach out to a lot of freshmen in the dorms and get the guys in our fraternity to talk to people they know who haven’t rushed yet,” Tomlinson said.
Tyler Henry, a freshman spring admit majoring in economics/mathematics, said spring rush gives him an opportunity to better adjust to USC.
“I think rushing is a better way to meet people, especially as someone new to USC and because I live off campus,” Henry said.
Though the image of The Row might have been tainted when the Department of Public Safety shut it down after the fraternities’ Welcome Back Nights got out of hand last semester, IFC has worked hard to increase safety on The Row.
“Fraternities have cooperated with DPS and IFC and we have and will do everything in our power to prevent events like what happened last semester and ensure students have a fun and safe time on The Row,” Moura said.
IFC hopes to not only increase the number of students who rush fraternities, but to continue the growth within the community.
“There are new fraternities starting up as we speak — think of Phi Sigma Kappa,” Moura said. “The USC fraternity system is growing without a doubt.”
The recruitment period began Monday night with house tours and will continue with events throughout the week at different venues depending on the fraternity. Bids will be handed out Saturday night following an invite-only blue chip dinner Friday night.
IFC is also hosting a secondary rush event Jan. 28 for people who might not have received a bid from their choice house and those who were not a part of original recruitment.
