“Lady Bird”
Directed by Greta Gerwig, this melancholic yet heartwarming film chronicles a 17-year-old girl trying to establish her personal identity while balancing her relationships with her mother and friends. Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is bored of her mundane life in Sacramento and wishes to start an exciting new life in a bustling city on the East Coast. 
However, Lady Bird’s desire to leave home and her need for attention and recognition prevent her from building closer relationships with those who care about her most. Audience members may find themselves relating to the fearless and determined young characters and the uncertainties they encounter during adolescence. The faithful record of the trials and tribulations that teenagers go through and the conflicts they may have with their parents make this movie especially appealing to young adult viewers. 
“Moonlight”
A critically acclaimed film and the Oscars Best Motion Picture winner in 2017, “Moonlight” is a coming-of-age story vividly depicting a young boy’s journey to self-discovery while growing up in a Black community in Miami. “Moonlight” touches on topics such as single-parent families, campus bullying and drug abuse. Both the acting and directing of the film are brilliant. The main character, Chiron, is played by three different actors, Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes, to show his life from childhood to adolescence to adulthood. The actors’ skillful performance seamlessly portray Chiron’s personality consistently and persuasively, making the audience believe that Chiron was played by one actor the entire time. Director Barry Jenkins uses strong narratives that make the story beautiful and exquisite, displaying a painfully honest depiction of the Black experience of realizing sexuality while living in poverty.
“The Farewell”
Ever since “The Joy Luck Club” made its debut 27 years ago, Hollywood has rarely made films featuring a majority Asian American cast. “The Farewell,” directed by Lulu Wang, made a difference by telling a story about a Chinese American family and their decision to not inform their grandmother that she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Billi (Awkwafina) believes her grandmother has the right to know about the situation, while her relatives think the truth will hurt their grandma even more. The movie displays the differences between Western and Eastern cultures and the clashes between modern and traditional ideas. However, the emotion the story evokes and the universal themes of life and death enable all audiences to find a connection in some form or another, making the movie worth watching.
“Ex Machina”
Released in 2014, “Ex Machina” is a well-produced science fiction thriller about artificial intelligence. Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a young man hired by a technology company to test a newly developed humanoid robot. As the android grows more humanlike, Caleb finds himself lost between his illusions of the robot and reality. This enthralling movie discusses topics that continue to impact our society in significant ways, including how technology deprives people of privacy and the potential influences AI may have on humans. Directed by Alex Garland, The suspenseful plot and stationary setting of the story make the film intense yet dazzling. 
“The Florida Project”
Told through the mischievous eyes of 6-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), the audience watches her life at a motel next to Walt Disney World in Orlando. Although born and raised in poverty, Moonee is always adaptable to changes and showcases the fun-loving and free-spirited nature of a child. The director of the film, Sean Baker, uses marvelous cinematic editing and color grading to make the story realistic and refreshing. His cinematography, notably the final scene shot on iPhone 6s, alludes to the ironic fact that people living next to the magical and dreamy Disney World do not have the luxury to achieve their dreams because they are struggling with extreme poverty. This idea brings a sad tone to the plot, yet the movie is still full of childish fantasies and joyful adventures, exhibiting a positive surge of energy and strong hopes for life and the future.

Wil Smith, a USC alumnus and real estate executive, has donated $10 million to the Sol Price School of Public Policy to fund scholarships, research opportunities and other resources, the University announced Wednesday. 
The donation renames the USC Department of Real Estate Development, which opened last year, the USC Price Wilbur H. Smith III Department of Real Estate Development. This is the school’s first naming gift of a department. 
Smith graduated fromPrice  with a master’s degree in real estate development in 1999, and in 2003 founded Greenlaw Partners, a real estate firm based in Southern California. Since then, Smith has remained involved within the USC and Price community by delivering guest lectures at the school and acting as a mentor to graduate students. He is also a member of the executive committee of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, the Price Board of Councilors and the Price School Real Estate Advisory Board. 
“He has done some pretty visionary projects,” Department of Real Estate Development chair Richard Green said. “He does a wide variety of things in the real estate business. He’s always been generous about sharing what he knows with our students, because he comes back and talks to our students on a regular basis.” 
According to Green, the department serves approximately 650 undergraduate and graduate students with majors or minors in real estate development. It also supports a group of researchers studying topics relating to real estate development. 
The money will primarily be used to recruit top faculty members to the department, provide financial aid for students studying real estate and summer funding for faculty research while also expanding professional development opportunities. . 
“[We want to] particularly help those [students], for whom USC would be a very expensive place … to help students come here, because one thing that’s very important for us is for people who traditionally have not gotten into the real estate business to get into that business,” Green said. 
The donation money will be put to use beginning next academic year.

USC’s football and men’s water polo teams will halt their workouts until at least Monday after eight student-athletes between the two sports tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a Wednesday USC Athletics press release. 
Contact tracing suggests that the virus did not come from athletic activities but rather from off campus amid a recent increase of coronavirus cases in the USC community. Forty-three off-campus students have tested positive for the virus, in addition to three in on-campus housing.
“We have effective mitigation strategies in place,” Athletic Director Mike Bohn said, adding that workouts are being halted “out of an abundance of caution.”
All eight student-athletes who tested positive are currently isolated. Athletes in the two affected sports will be tested again this week.
All USC athletic workouts have been conducted outdoors and without contact, in accordance with Pac-12 and public health guidelines. Testing conducted between July 18 and Aug. 21 yielded one positive coronavirus case among 654 tests of student-athletes taking part in on-campus workouts as part of USC’s three-phase return-to-campus plan for football, soccer, women’s volleyball, men’s water polo and men’s and women’s basketball.
There had been no positive tests in the last three weeks prior to the Wednesday announcement.

Two students from Cale and Irani Residential College and one student from Century Apartments tested positive for the coronavirus, Co-Medical Director, Faculty Physician of Internal Medicine Dr. Kimberly Tilley confirmed in a Zoom call with the Daily Trojan Wednesday. The cases are the first instances of infection within USC Housing.
The students are currently self-isolating off campus and those believed to be exposed are being contacted, according to an email sent to residents and employees in the residential college that was obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
According to Tilley, the contact tracing procedure is largely the same for both on- and off-campus students, with the former group involving more University departments to identify where the individual has been aside from their place of residence. USC’s main priority is safeguarding students’ health rather than disciplining individuals who contract the illness, Tilley said.
“People do not get in trouble for getting COVID,” Tilley said. “I mean, there is a lot of COVID in L.A. County and there’s a lot of COVID around USC, and you aren’t going to get in trouble because you get COVID … We’re not taking cases and reporting to Student Affairs, we’re taking care of the students.”
Tilley encouraged all students to take advantage of the weekly testing offered in partnership with Color, in addition to contacting the Engemann Student Health Center directly by phone or through MySHR, the Student Health scheduling and record portal, if they have symptoms or direct exposure, as the center’s physicians are more equipped with personal protective equipment and testing there yields faster results.
“We want your contacts because we want to get all your contacts in quarantine, we want to help them if they need to quarantine, we want to isolate you from your friends if we need to do that, and then we want to get those contacts tested because we’re really just trying to slow down the rise in cases that we’re seeing,” Tilley said. “That is our mission.”

As the pandemic surges on, museums and community galleries are no longer convenient weekend getaways. Luckily, Los Angeles continues to serve as one of the most culturally rich galleries in the world, home to an intimately curated collection of towering outdoor installations. 
These convention-breaking pieces tell forgotten stories and breathe themes of vibrancy, rhythm and freedom throughout the city, taking risks and coloring daily commutes. Get ready for the most unforgettable road trip around the city possible in these trying times, because whether these vivid works stay displayed for decades or just a handful of hours, one thing is for sure — they’re all located across the street. 
Abuelita 
Resting on the side of the American Hotel in the Arts District, Abuelita is a portrait of Navajo weaver Martha Gorman Schultz, who has spent the entirety of her life practicing the Indigenous art form through her geometric tapestries. In honor of her craft, Abuelita came to life with the help of three street artists, El Mac, Kofie and Nuke, each weaving their stylistic elements into the frame of a larger creation tale. The side profile of Abuelita is painted in neutral beige and gray tones, looking up at the stars. 
She has a familiar demeanor almost similar to a grandmother of your own. Contributing artist Joseph ‘Nuke’ Montalvo puts it best, telling the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles, “A blanket carries so much weight. It holds our dreams. But do we often wonder who weaves the blanket, or what they were thinking? La abuelita, she thinks of us when she weaves. It is not so hard to imagine that God is a grandmother.”  
Technicolor Drip
Let’s be honest, we’re all sick and tired of the Paul Smith Pink Wall on Melrose; it’s crowded, basic and runs out of flavor faster than, well, bubblegum. If you’re looking for a new crush, meet the pink wall’s drippy, trippy, psychedelic cousin: the Technicolor Ooze Wall. 
Painted by artist Jen Stark, whose work adorns the Miami International Airport and Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., “Technicolor Drip” pays a modernist homage to the coloring process most prevalently featured in 20th-century film. With its candy-like hues, this bright baby brings to mind the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” from “The Wizard of Oz.” The iconic film was captured in Culver City, where the Technicolor wall resides today, dripping down the side of the parking structure at PLATFORM. 
The Saskia Mural
In mid-2019, when Tetris took its last breath, a generation of flash game enthusiasts weeped virtual tears and lovingly packed their go-to time-killer away. For the block stacking lover, “The Saskia Mural” sprawled across the wall now occupied by Animal Kingdom’s Santa Monica location brings back nostalgia with a simplistic and summery twist. 
Joe Nicoletti, owner of the company Chameleon Paintworks and father of the turquoise and sunshine-yellow creation, chose to paint each brick of the once gray wall a different color, but for a reason that is far less obvious. The colors were inspired by and specifically ordered to match a bra owned by Nicoletti’s girlfriend, Saskia, hence its namesake, “The Saskia Mural.” 
Fun fact: Tech giant Lenovo actually liked the mural so much that it was used in the background of one of its advertisements without credit to the artist, unintentionally entering a lawsuit from which Nicoletti walked away with a handsome settlement. Who says art doesn’t pay? 
The Kobe Bryant Memorial Mural 
It’s hard to remember a time when L.A. grieved harder than the passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna in early January. Although Kobe Bryant Day has passed (Aug. 24), the memorial mural on La Brea earns an honorary mention. The day was celebrated this year with Figueroa Street soon to be named Kobe Bryant Boulevard, between Olympic and Martin Luther King Boulevards, demonstrating that memories of the basketball star live on. 
The mural itself was completed by street artist Thierry Guetta, more commonly known as Mr. Brainwash, and depicts the smiling former Lakers player with his arm around Gianna. The background is accented with pops of color set against newspaper prints detailing Bryant’s achievements in the NBA. Other casualties of the Calabasas helicopter crash are recognized as well with their names written in purple on a yellow backdrop, a nod to the Lakers’ team colors. The sheer detail in the piece makes for a breathtaking tribute that doesn’t take a basketball fanatic to appreciate. 
The Masked Kiss
Tattoo artist, model and street artist Pony Wave is better known for her appearance on the reality tattoo competition show “The Inkmaster.” Still, her latest mural featuring two lovers kissing while separated by cloth masks is a show-stopping standalone piece. The faces are monochrome, but where their lips meet, flowers bloom. Its redefinition of what it means to love others during these desperate times has never been more necessary, an eye-catching pro-mask reminder decorating Venice Beach. 
Street art on Venice Beach never lasts long, but Pony’s art has a powerful, distinctive quality that leaves a hard-to-erase impression. Striking in both its timeless beauty and immediate relevance,the piece went live a few days before L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti set forward a face covering mandate and is. 
RETNA @ The West Hollywood Library
The West Hollywood Library was dull and dilapidated before RETNA, the street and studio artist born Marquis Lewis, took charge of the situation. He paints his signature cryptic calligraphy in decadent blue against a white background, a color combination seemingly strange among a sea of typical jewel tones and neons. Influenced by a cocktail of Arabic calligraphy, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Hebrew, Blackletter and Indigenous American typographies, his script is rapturing and those familiar with his work can spot his trademark style from a mile away. 
Considering the building that it calls its home, the quote that he transcribes onto the stone walls couldn’t be more fitting. Emblazoned on the wall is a quote from the author Salman Rushdie that roughly translates to, “Literature is where I go to explore the highest and lowest places in human society and in the human spirit, where I hope to find not absolute truth but the truth of the tale, of the imagination, and of the heart.” 
Urban Light
Although not as independent or organic as street art in its most traditional sense, a comprehensive evening is best concluded with a brief trip to the entrance of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There you’ll find 202 antique street lamps standing in a grid that change angles and arrays depending on the placement of the viewer, forming a stunning sculpture best enjoyed at night. 
With 16 different street light models represented, each light once faithfully lit the streets of L.A. The bulbs are solar-powered and switch on and off by way of an astrological timer. Its original artist, performance sculpturist Chris Burden, bought the first lamp at a Rose Bowl flea market before it became an obsession he could not stop. Each lamp is painted the same shade of gray to better demonstrate the structural differences each presents. At night, Burden was fond of describing the sculpture as a “building with a roof of light.”

The Undergraduate Student Government swore in a new president, vice president and senator during the senate meeting Tuesday. This leadership restructure comes after the resignations of three USG officials this summer. 
The first to be sworn in was Joshua Wigler, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture. Wigler, along with his running mate Shreya Chanda, ran for seats in the Senate last spring. The pair did not win positions originally, but due to the recent reconfiguration of USG leadership, they were both able to fill vacancies this semester. Chanda, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry and global health, was sworn in at last week’s meeting. Despite the unusual circumstances encompassing this semester, Wigler said he is excited to be admitted to USG.
“As a new USG senator, I really am looking towards the future and hoping that we can really affect some positive changes,” Wigler said. “I think it’s really important that if you want to see the change … you’ll need to get up and involve yourself in student government.”
Trinity Moore, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts, was next appointed as vice president. Previously a senator, Moore brings almost three years of student government experience to the position. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, she expressed her motivation behind running for USG vice president. 
“There was a moment during the summer where I really saw how far USG has drifted from the true core value of representing students, and I wanted to do whatever I could to help us get back on track,” Moore said. “It was kind of like a moment where I felt like I was called to the position … I know why I joined USG three years ago, and I want to be able to fulfill that same purpose here in this position, and I’m excited to do so.”
The shift in USG’s values that Moore mentioned refer to the resignations of former President Truman Fritz, former Vice President Rose Ritch and former Sen. Isabel Washington. After evidence of messages and posts from Washington containing classist and racist rhetoric circulated on social media this summer, she stepped down July 1. Fritz’s resignation followed testimonies on the Instagram account @black_at_usc claiming he engaged in multiple instances of racial misconduct and microaggressive behavior and the circulation of a petition calling for his impeachment and Ritch’s due to her complicity in her co-executive’s behavior. Fritz and Ritch resigned July 7 and Aug. 5, respectively.
Replacing Fritz as president is former Speaker of the Senate Gabe Savage, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and narrative studies. During his time as president, Savage said he hopes to mend some of the division between students that heightened over the summer. 
“By the time I leave office, if the student body feels more connected with itself, with other students, then I have done my job well,” Savage told the Daily Trojan. 
During their shared inauguration speech, Savage and Moore detailed their agenda concerning diversity. The duo said they plan to create an executive cabinet composed of students focused on change and advocacy. They also plan on implementing a Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly in USG and adding the Palestinian flag to the Center for International and Public Affairs, which is meant to represent every country where at least two students are from. 
Both executives said they promised to effectively advocate for all USC undergraduate students during their time in office. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, Savage and Moore provided words of hope for USG’s future.
“Together, moving forward, we will work to restore the culture of the organization, carving out a path of inclusion, acceptance and belonging for every one of our 20,000 undergraduate students,” Moore said at the end of the speech. “We look forward to embarking on this journey towards a better tomorrow, and a brighter USG.”
Correction: A previous version of this article contained a spelling error. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

With various universities such as Notre Dame and Michigan State sending their on-campus students home after the inevitable coronavirus spikes, it was refreshing to see that for once, USC wasn’t involved in such a scandal. However, that pleasant attitude was unfortunately short-lived. With the fall semester underway, USC students have returned and are flocking to off-campus housing. 
At face value, this seems promising: Off-campus housing allows students to shelter-in-place, work from home and limit everyday exposure that would have otherwise been difficult to avoid had the students moved into on-campus residence halls. Yet, Los Angeles County’s preventative measure to keep USC’s campus closed in hopes of preventing another spike in cases will likely yield little success. Since Aug. 14, the Department of Public Safety has already reported eight party shutdowns, and it is highly probable that the actual number of parties happening off-campus is much greater than what has been reported.
It is no secret that some USC students are completely disregarding the fact that a global health crisis is ongoing in a densely populated community. Reckless actions, such as partying in a pandemic and gathering without masks or any regard for social distancing guidelines by certain USC students, will almost certainly lead to a spike in coronavirus cases on and around campus. Such a spike will disproportionately impact high-risk students as well as non-USC community members.
It must not go without mention that institutions such as the University are aggravating South Central’s rapid gentrification by increasing rent and cost of living to the point where community members with generational ties to this area are being priced out of their own neighborhoods. A recent Washington Post report noted that Black-owned businesses in South Central will have a significantly harder time recovering from the looming recession. Such a recession will inherently leave these already vulnerable communities at risk to more aggressive gentrification in the future. Thus, it is a significant slap to the face to the rest of South Central when students return to campus and immediately disregard the surrounding community’s health and safety. 
These parties and events demonstrate significant ignorance among a certain group of USC students, ignorance that manifests in their prioritization of social capital over the well-being of others. These students are either completely ignorant of the impact of a coronavirus outbreak in this community or simply too selfish to care. 
More importantly, such an outbreak in this community would not only disproportionately affect those who are considered high-risk, but also Black and Latinx USC and non-USC community members. A recent Los Angeles Times report stated that, according to data released by the county, Latinx and Black residents have significantly higher coronavirus mortality rates than their white neighbors. 
If students continue to gather and ignore social distancing guidelines, there will be a spike in cases and therefore a spike in coronavirus-related deaths in South Central communities. The students attending these reckless events will first spread it to their roommates, especially those residing in densely packed fraternity and sorority housing. 
These students, even those who chose not to attend parties, can then bring the virus into the critical businesses, such as Trader Joe’s, Target, Smart & Final and Ralphs. This action necessarily introduces the virus to the local community, whether it be to the employees who work at these businesses or the residents who have to do their essential shopping at shared locations. 
The students who are still attending parties and ignoring the coronavirus risks are blatantly reckless and willfully ignorant of the considerable impact of a spike in the local community. These students ought to seriously consider the health and safety of those around them before cracking open an unimpressive and lukewarm White Claw.

I applied to write this column because I feel that certain perspectives — and sometimes, even entire issues — are not being adequately covered. I want to use my voice not only to add to current discourse but also to elevate it and (hopefully) incite change within the USC community and beyond. The conversations we have about race and politics are more consequential now than ever before, especially with the 2020 presidential election fast approaching, and it’s important that we identify and name systems of oppression wherever we find them, whether that be our University’s administration or in our political rhetoric. 
For one, the political pundit class seems to be obsessed with euphemisms. Two stick out to me in particular: “coastal elites” and “working class.” The term “coastal elites” denotes wealthy, highly educated, often white and perpetually out-of-touch folks. The term “working class” often describes white folks with blue-collar jobs, as opposed to the literal working class. Coastal elites reside in “liberal bubbles” up and down the East and West coasts while the working class resides in “the Heartland” — and there’s not much middle ground.
That being said, pundits do generally recognize other identity groups. It is not uncommon to turn on the news and hear commentators describe Black, Latinx and immigrant communities as individual and politically monolithic groups. In truth, however, these groups are not afforded the political analysis they deserve and are ultimately erased by the larger, coastal elite and working-class monikers.
The majority of all Americans and the vast majority of people of color in this country live on the so-called coasts — but the “coastal elite” denomination dismisses them all as being out-of-touch. I don’t think it’s that pundits believe that everyone in Los Angeles is a movie star, everyone in San Francisco is a tech billionaire or everyone in New York City is a media titan. However, using the term “coastal elite” is an easy way to dismiss entire swaths of people, especially people of color who, despite having very complex personal politics, are not electorally interesting. In some senses, they are the polar opposite of the swing voters who allege that they voted for President Donald Trump because of economic anxiety.
People of color, particularly Black and Latinx folk, overwhelmingly vote for and support Democratic policies. It’s easy to just say voters of color vote for Democrats because that’s what voters of color do. That being said, with just a little political analysis, one would find that communities of color are diverse — made up of both blue- and white-collar workers and folks of all education levels — with individuals who make personal political decisions based off of their lived realities.
The “coastal elite” designation creates and adds to problems outside political discourse. This manifests in the question of District of Columbia statehood: The district has a population of just more than 705,000, which would make it one of the smallest states by population, but still larger in population size than Wyoming and Vermont. The implications of granting the District of Columbia statehood are that it would get a voting member of the House of Representatives and, more impactfully, two U.S. senators. 
As our constitution stands, each state is assigned two senators, irrespective of population size. This means states with smaller populations, which often skew Republican, get just as much representation in the U.S. Senate as more populated states which skew Democrat and coastal.
Republican legislators, led by Sen. Tom Cotton, object to the concept of District of Columbia statehood on the basis that, unlike Wyoming, it would not be a “well-rounded” and “working-class state,” noting that a large percentage of residents work in government. While it obviously doesn’t make sense to deny citizens representation on the basis of their education level and careers in government, that argument ignores the fact that not everyone in the District of Columbia is a political transplant. 
Notably, the District of Columbia has a large Black population that has been there for generations, a population that is not ubiquitously focused on the Hill. Thinking about this in context, then, it suddenly makes more sense that the Harvard College- and Harvard Law School-educated United States senator would utilize an argument that doesn’t make sense on its face. When Cotton says the District of Columbia is not well-rounded and working-class, what he means is white — the district is not white, unlike Wyoming, which is almost 93% white.
I don’t think I am reaching because this is the same Cotton who believes chattel slavery was a necessary evil and that the United States military should have been used to quell protests surrounding the death of Black people at the hands of the police. Cotton was able to weaponize the language of pundits to meet his political ends. It’s the perfect example of lazy rhetoric and analysis lending to illogical and racist praxis.

Growing up in Irving, Texas, one of the most diverse zip codes in the United States, Abeer Tijani sought a similar community when she came to USC. Watching YouTube videos from USC students like Katherout and Justin Escalona, she imagined herself fitting into the USC ecosystem almost immediately and fell in love with the campus through her laptop screen. As she was taking her first steps on Trousdale during her senior year of high school, the first word she thought of was home.
Applying in December, she earned a full-tuition merit scholarship — a circumstance she described as fate and the best possible outcome she could have received. 
“My sophomore year of high school, I was in this SAT prep class, and our first assignment was for us to look up a dream school and a school that we knew we could get into,” Tijani said. “And at that time, I didn’t really know where I wanted to apply or anything. But something in me was like, ‘I think living in California would be cool. I visited UCLA first and my mom actually really liked UCLA, but I was just kind of like ‘Eh, it’s fine, it’s cool.’ And then I visited USC and … I absolutely knew that this was where I had to be.”
Now a senior majoring in global health, Tijani said her college experience — although filled with friends and personal growth — cannot match up to the cliché of the college experience seen in the movies. However, Tijani believes the way she’s grown would not have been the same had she attended another university. 
Two days following the killing of George Floyd and amid a worldwide reckoning over racism, Tijani sat down in front of a camera and called for her non-Black followers to educate themselves, show up for Black people and “do the right thing even if it makes you uncomfortable.” Gathering the courage to deliver a message that would resonate with her friends and peers, she recorded herself 10 times before releasing an IGTV video titled “What I need from you” — a video that she also recorded in Spanish. Also directed to her non-Black friends and followers on Instagram, a small community of people on her then-private account, Tijani discussed the urgency for them to engage in anti-racist efforts through the conversations they were having with family and friends, and also within the communities that they were a part of.
“We have to step outside of what we feel is comfortable in order to do what is absolutely right,” Tijani said. “I was kind of tired of hearing the question ‘Why does this keep happening?’ or ‘I don’t understand how racism still exists in 2020’ — it’s definitely still alive and well and in our faces. We have to move that question from ‘Why does this keep happening?’ to ‘What can I do about it?’”
In addition to multiple videos from Tijani calling for change, she has also been using social media to educate her followers to commit to an anti-racist life by sharing infographics and resources, as well as speaking at panels and sharing her writings through IGTV. Through her calls to impeach or remove former Undergraduate Student Government President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch, Tijani became a more prominent student leader on campus.
“I think that a lot of the time with social movements and advocacy, people feel as though they can’t really do anything, or I think a lot of the times we can feel really small when trying to tackle really big issues,” Tijani said. “However, there comes a certain point where you’re kind of forced to move to action because something just either exacerbates you so much or shocks you so much, or you have — at least for me — a physical, visceral reaction and you’re just kind of like ‘I don’t get it.’”
Emigrating from Nigeria at age three, Tijani resided in a diverse neighborhood and attended a high school that was 12% white. When she got to USC, it was a culture shock. Although many label the campus as diverse, 29% of the student body is white, according to USC’s 2019-2020 “Facts and Figures.”
Learning across barriers
From a young age, Tijani said her commitment to empathy and loving people came from her mother, who, before anything else, taught Tijani to “see people as people …  as opposed to coming in with preconceived notions or expectations or stereotypes of how somebody should be.” Through her religious and collectivist cultural upbringing, she also said she learned to value her community. 
“Something that is a huge core tenet in Islam is the sense of justice and fighting for what’s right,” Tijani said. “The way that the religion was taught to me was that we’re not the only people on Earth. We don’t share the Earth with just ourselves or our families, and it’s absolutely important and imperative that we try to help uplift oppressed people everywhere and free them from their oppressors.”
 Although she believes the community in which she grew up was not holistically anti-racist, Tijani said she was surrounded by people of different backgrounds that pushed her to consider other people’s stories and circumstances to the best of her ability for the past 21 years of her life. 
“I try to learn about people’s stories as much as possible and … that has helped in terms of being able to communicate issues across different cultural barriers or cultural circumstances,” she said. “We really are so much more alike than we are different … there’s not that much that separates us as human beings from person to person. I wish people would realize that more.”
Wanting to connect more with the people around her, Tijani decided to learn Spanish at the age of 14, so she would be able to communicate with one of her close friend’s mothers, an undocumented Mexican immigrant. Spanish is now the third language that Tijani is close to fluent in, in addition to her native Nigerian language, Yoruba, and English. 
“I always told myself that ‘I’m going to be able to learn this language that way to communicate with [her] and make [her] feel comfortable,’” Tijani said. “I empathize fully with feeling like you can’t express yourself properly in a different language and wanting to be able to and wanting to reach out to this other person.” 
Tijani continued to meet people who inspired her in college. With aspirations to attend law school, Tijani was mentored by April Yang, a former Gould School of Law student who encouraged her and was someone she could bounce ideas off of. From her friends on campus to her journalist role models Anthony Bourdain and Noor Tagouri, Tijani said she was able to find courage and strength when she struggled to see that within herself at times. 
“All my friends, in their own unique ways, have inspired me because they’re people that I know that I can have uncomfortable, dynamic conversations with and that we can challenge each other’s ideas and that we can really push each other to be better,” Tijani said. “I think it’s really important that you surround yourself, not with people who are always going to agree with what you have to say, but with people that are going to make you a better person even if what looks better  like makes you uncomfortable.”
For Tijani, the most worthwhile aspect of attending the University has been the friends that she’s made.
“I think that they have been the most clear cut example to me of how possible it is for an anti-racist world to exist because I get to live in that world every single day, due to the people that I surround myself with,” Tijani said. “I have friends from literally all over the world, from lots of different backgrounds and that have walked so many different paths of life, and they have absolutely made me a better person, a thousand percent.”
Alexis Timko, a junior majoring in journalism and law, history and culture, recently met Tijani after watching one of her IGTV videos and reached out to ask if she could repost it on her account. Since then, they have collaborated on creating a list of action items for Greek organizations. Only knowing each other for the past three to four months, Timko said Tijani has driven her to be a better person and is excited to see the changes she will continue to make at USC. According to Timko, Tijani has engaged in her activism efforts without compensation — when the onus should not be on her as a Black woman — including a Greek life panel Tijani put together in June. 
“There are no words that accurately describe all of the wonder, intelligence and delight that is Abeer Tijani,” Timko said. “She just makes people want to think about things that they didn’t even know existed, and she inspires people to educate themselves and others around them … Abeer, without any doubt in my mind, is the most remarkable person that I’ve ever met.”
Pushing for campus accountability
However, Tijani’s college experience has included uncomfortable moments, such as observing the cyclical pattern of public outrage around continued acts of racism and trending headlines on social media following a Black person’s murder. With allegations against prominent student government leaders on campus coming to light amid nationwide talks about race and ongoing police brutality targeting Black people, Tijani began demanding change on campus.
Anonymous submissions to the @black_at_usc page, an Instagram account that shares unheard stories of Black Trojans, alleged Fritz of making racist and microaggressive remarks against Black students. Soon after the posts circulated online, Tijani created and spread a petition requesting his resignation from USG. Following a lack of response from Fritz and Ritch, Tijani filed a formal impeachment complaint against them a few days later on July 1. Following the complaint and increased pressure from students, Fritz resigned in early July. Ritch resigned Aug. 5.
During her efforts calling for the removal of Fritz and Ritch, Tijani consulted with Jaya Hinton, co-executive director of the Black Student Assembly, to understand USG bylaws regarding the impeachment process since BSA is an organization under the umbrella of student government. Serving as an informal adviser to Tijani, Hinton spoke to her a few times a day to assist her in understanding USG culture and structure. Hinton said she admires Tijani’s determination and leadership in tackling issues she cares about and was impressed with what Tijani has accomplished. 
“I know a lot of Black people were [looking to her] for direction to what they thought their next move was going to be,” said Hinton, a rising junior majoring in business administration. “She wasn’t cocky about it … She genuinely wanted to make the school better.” 
Two days after Ritch’s resignation, Tijani’s social media messages were flooded with harassment from Zionist accounts accusing her of antisemitism because of her efforts in Ritch’s impeachment process. Although she did not call for Ritch’s impeachment based on her Jewish and Zionist identity, Tijani issued an apology to pro-Israel students for any harm she may have caused by focusing on Palestinian concerns and condemned antisemitic attacks against Ritch in an Instagram statement on June 27. Additionally, she posted an IGTV July 7, the same day of Fritz’s resignation, urging students to focus their energy on learning from the claims of racism and microaggressions against him rather than resorting to “bullying.”
“I would like to reiterate, once again, that the allegations underlying my calls for impeachment primarily implicated the microaggressions perpetrated by our former president against some of his [Black and Indigenous constituents and constituents of color], as evidenced by the accounts shared anonymously on the @black_at_usc Instagram page,” Tijani wrote in the Aug. 6 statement reaffirming her thought process behind her calls for impeachment. “I also called for the impeachment of our vice president, citing her failure to defend or take action in support of [Black and Indigenous students and students of color] at USC as evidence of her complicity in the president’s racially insensitive conduct. There is a difference between quiet compliance and explicit endorsement and I took great care to avoid accusing Rose of the latter.” 
In her statement, Tijani emphasized the necessity for an inclusive, non-discriminatory campus that serves to protect all students regardless of identity and beliefs.
“In this vision of USC, we vigilantly protect students like Rose who have been persecuted for their beliefs and identities, while also diligently incorporating nuance and empathy into our understandings of one another and our calls for change, leaving no need for such students to be wrongfully scapegoated and left to fend for themselves,” Tijani wrote. “At the same time, if Rose had spoken out in support of the Black community at USC with the conviction and zeal with which she was so quick to defend herself and her own community, one can only imagine how differently this situation might have played out.”
At the time of publication, Ritch has not made a public comment addressing the doxing and attacks by pro-Israel publications that Tijani has received. 
In its statement of solidarity with Tijani published Aug. 13, BSA reiterated the reasoning behind the impeachment process, denouncing President Carol Folt for conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, ignoring the anti-Black behavior that led to the calls for removal and failing to uplift and protect Black and Palestinian students. 
“The manipulation of that context [anti-Blackness], the victimization of Truman, and the martyring of Rose that followed took away from our movement and centered whiteness amidst it all,” the statement read. “This is anti-Black. This vivid manifestation of white privilege and blatant disregard for Black students and Black voices became very apparent in the treatment of Abeer Tijani.”
Ramata Franklin, a senior studying global health, NGOs and social change while pursuing a master’s in public health,  and Tijani’s friend, in a post Aug. 8 called on the University to release a public statement in support of Tijani, stating that its misconstruction of the events leading to Fritz and Ritch’s removal resulted in undue harm to Tijani and marginalized students.
“This letter has led to the eschewal of Abeer’s efforts to call out injustices; it has emboldened people to pin her advocacy for marginalized students to the ad hominem attacks suffered by Rose,” Franklin wrote. “False narratives that discredit and misconstrue Abeer’s activism have been used by trolls and bullies to virtually harass and dehumanize her online.”
USC has not yet released a statement in explicit support of Tijani at the time of publication. A memo from vice president of Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Dr. Varun Soni sent Aug. 24 referred vaguely to online intimidation and doxxing with no distinct renouncement of the harassment against her.
Since the start of the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests, Tijani said the movement has exposed systemic faults that have not been addressed by individuals and institutions, such as racist histories and ideologies. She also said the movement has included holding those in power, such as student leaders and campuses, accountable if they are not following the standards of excellence an anti-racist society must have. Tijani hopes that people continue to exercise their right to protest and petition to call on those in leadership positions to take action. 
“There’s a lot of people that have always subconsciously thought ‘[I] don’t discriminate’ but people are starting to really learn and understand and try to recognize all the different faces that discrimination can take,” Tijani said. “And because of that I think that people have been revamping the spaces that they occupy on campus.”
As someone who has also been thrust into the public eye from the attention her activism efforts have received, Tijani said she is also navigating how to effectively leverage the weight of her words and have a more intentional form of empathy by driving action to a particular cause in a productive and sustainable way. Although these conversations may make people uncomfortable, she said she believes they are necessary to enact change within institutions such as USC and society at large.
“I don’t think that anything good comes easy,” she said, “And I don’t think that anything that will actually dismantle the deeply ingrained systems of racism that are at our University and beyond in the actual real world will be done from doing work that we think is easier or comes at comfort to us.”
As one of the student leaders calling for systemic change on campus, Tijani said the process has made her uncomfortable and could hurt her chances at some job opportunities or graduate schools. While pushing for accountability within USG and its leadership and informing others on anti-Black racism, the biggest struggle she has faced is balancing her mental health. 
“I think talking about the psychological effects that racism can have really wears on you, and it’s definitely worn on me,” Tijani said. “As I discuss and engage and educate and inform people, I’m also reliving my own traumas simultaneously, but I don’t have as much space and grace to be able to work through that.”
Tijani said her efforts have led people to think of her as a “face of activism at USC,” and look to her for direction. However, she said she and other leaders on campus and across the nation should not be the only people communities look to for guidance and encourages others to get involved. 
“People should understand that we can’t count on a few people to carry the brunt of everything. Eventually, these people are going to be exhausted and want to tap out because everyone’s human,” Tijani said. “So it’s just kind of figuring out where can I contribute? And how can I use my own talents and skills in order to either carry the legacy of this work or start my own thing?”
She also encourages students who are currently involved in the Black Lives Matter movement —who are feeling fatigue, anxiety or exhaustion — to not pressure themselves to do everything but to also not be complicit in racism. 
“I think that you have to prepare to give yourself as much constructive grace as possible,” Tijani said. “I think critical grace makes you understand that you can’t do everything and you’re not going to do everything right and you’re going to do a lot of things wrong but that also simultaneously propels you into action and makes sure that you’re keeping yourself in check in terms of not being complicit.”
A continuing commitment to supporting Black Lives Matters and the other causes student activists along with Tijani have advanced shouldn’t be in the form of a fleeting moment, a repost or in a space where there won’t be any dissidents, she urged. 
“If you are in a club and you reposted your club statement about Black Lives Matter, or if you personally think that you believe in Black Lives Matter, you need to sit down with yourself and understand the gravity of your words, and understand that Black Lives Matter is not conditional, and it should not come through your ease and your comfort,” Tijani said. “Right? Like there’s going to be a lot of privileges that will have to be sacrificed in order to be truly anti-racist. If you find yourself saying Black Lives Matter, but only [acting upon it] in circumstances where you’re absolutely comfortable, I don’t think you understand the weight of what you’re promising.”
Envisioning a “new USC”
While Tijani, believes a “new USC” is in the works, she won’t be one of the students to see the fruits of labor from current and previous activist efforts. 
“I’m seeing the fledglings of that new USC, but there’s a long road ahead of us before that new USC can actually come to fruition,” Tijani said. “However, that USC is one where anti-racism is a core tenet in every facet of student, faculty, administrative life. It’s a non-negotiable for how we think, how we interact with each other and how we hold each other accountable.”
Tijani envisions the University’s future as a place where the student experience is one based on respect and [everyone in the] community is comfortable being themselves. 
“I want to be able to come back in 20 years. And if my kids want to go to USC, I shouldn’t hesitate to say ‘Yes,’” Tijani said. “I shouldn’t hesitate to say, ‘I know that it’s different because we put the work in to lay the foundation for it to be a USC that I [didn’t] get to experience, but you absolutely should.’”
Although universities nationwide have begun to enact small changes on their campuses, institutions like USC must address their complicity in anti-Black racism, Tijani said. She also said it is currently profitable for institutions to care about Black people because of the surge in popularity in the Black LIves Matter protests, adding a component of commercialization to the movement in order to have basic empathy for people. 
In her final year as an undergraduate, Tijani said her focus isn’t to enact change for herself, but for the incoming students that look like her. 
“I think back to really uncomfortable moments that I’ve had or moments where [I’ve] felt small, and I don’t want [a new student] to feel that way because I don’t think that [they] deserve to feel that way, and [they] absolutely [don’t] deserve to be made to feel that way,” Tijani said. “I think whatever we can do in this present time … to make everyone else as comfortable as possible, is absolutely necessary.”
For students contemplating and looking to make a difference on campus, Tijani said she is proud of them choosing to because taking action takes bravery and courage. She encourages students to believe in their cause, even if they don’t receive immediate support.  
“If you feel this is truth and this is justice, that’s all you absolutely need in order to start and … if your cause is good and your work is good, people will start to validate that,” Tijani said. “Eventually, people will come and support you. And you’ll realize that you don’t have to do everything alone. But sometimes, like, you just have to be the one to start it … doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to be the one to finish it.”

Amid the chaos of 2020 — including the way-too-long sports shutdown — the NBA restart at Walt Disney World has been so exciting and fast-paced that each game feels like March Madness. Each team is playing with so much energy, it’s like their seasons were never even suspended in the first place.
However, the players in the bubble have made it well known that they are playing for more than just the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy. Players are motivated beyond their drive to win. They’re playing for justice.
The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and most recently the shooting of Jacob Blake have reignited the Black Lives Matter movement that has been prioritized by the NBA and its players this season more than virtually any in the league’s history.
“BLACK LIVES MATTER” is printed above center court each game and players have messages such as “Equality” and “Peace” written above their jersey numbers and on their sneakers. The subject of many postgame press conferences has been diverted away from basketball entirely and toward the pressing issue of racial injustice in this country.
All of this has raised the following questions for some: Do we even need sports at all right now? Should successful athletes speak on pertinent issues unrelated to sports while on the court? Should we even mix sports and social justice initiatives together?
The answers: Yes, yes and yes.
One of my favorite things about sports is that it can always bring people together. The pandemic and social justice movement have revealed deep-rooted ideological differences in the public sphere. Our country has arguably become more divided than it has ever been before. Sports, on the other hand, is nonpartisan: You don’t have to belong to a certain political party to shoot some hoops or watch basketball. Team sports, especially, are all about communication, cooperation, teamwork and perseverance.
Since the beginning of the NBA restart, I’ve seen a lot of posts about players advocating for the Black Lives Matter movement on my Instagram feed. But within the comment sections of these posts, I’ve seen a lot more hate toward these athletes for speaking out against racial injustice. Many of these comments have to do with the notion that it doesn’t make sense for NBA players to say that they’re “scared as Black men” in this country — like LeBron James said Monday night — since they are high-profile, wealthy athletes, and that victims of police shootings “should have just complied” with the officers at the scene to avoid violence.
These comments cannot be more insular. Numbers don’t lie: Black men are 2.5 times as likely to be shot and killed by police than their white counterparts.
So when athletes like James make such comments, they are making them from the perspective of a Black person in the United States, period. Wealth does not change one’s race. The argument that Black athletes are somehow immune to police brutality due to the size of their pockets is invalid. 
It’s also hard to fathom why people think it’s okay to watch, bet on and root for Black athletes on the court but not support them as Black people off the court, as Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said in a tweet in June.
What I really want to say with this column, though, is that sports not only brings people together, but as we are witnessing perhaps most prominently with the NBA, sports can be used as a vehicle to spread awareness and support social justice initiatives. The main thing that the NBA Players Association wanted during negotiations on the NBA restart with regard to social justice was to have the players’ voices heard not for publicity reasons but because they knew that their high-profile stature will make fans listen to their words.
Kneeling spreads awareness. Speaking out during press conferences — like Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart did in July — spreads awareness. Sending out tweets calling for change spreads awareness.
Although my New York Knicks are (unsurprisingly) not competing in the playoffs right now and I’m not rooting for any team in particular to be crowned this tumultuous season’s champion, I find it extremely important to hear what NBA players have to say about the recent shooting of Blake, who was shot in the back seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis. in front of his own children. After all, they have the platform — and they have all the right in the world — to make a difference.

Trojan midfielder Olufolasade “Sade” Adamolekun has already faced the pressure of international soccer as a member of the Jamaican Women’s National Team, but 2020 has brought challenges the talented sophomore could never have foreseen.
“Right now, nothing is ensured,” Adamolekun said. “[The women’s soccer team] doesn’t know for sure if we are going to have a spring season … [I’m] just gonna pretend that we are so I make sure that I’m prepared for when it does happen.”
In many respects, Adamolekun was more prepared for the turmoil and uncertainty omnipresent in college sports this year than most. 
Born into a hyper-successful, athletic family, her father grew up playing soccer in Nigeria, her mother ran track at the University of Texas at Austin and her brother has followed a stellar soccer career at the University of North Carolina with professional stints in Austria, Portugal and currently the United Soccer League.
If you’re quick to think that athletic skill is in her DNA, she’d be the first to agree.
“I feel like it’s our family thing. We love sports, and growing up having a sibling who also plays the same sport as me definitely helped,” Sade said. “We were able to push each other.”
With such a prolific family background, it’s little surprise that Sade has already set and achieved a number of lofty goals for herself. 
During a stellar two-year career at Fleming High School in Clay County, Fla., Adamolekun established herself as the team’s top goal scorer on her way to a 2017 All-Conference first team nomination. 
From there, she fell in love with USC and committed to join the team for the 2019 season. There was only one thing she had to do first: compete for Jamaica at the 2019 World Cup in France.  
But how did the United States-raised daughter of a Nigerian father and a Jamaican mother choose which country to compete for? According to her, it was less of a choice and more a matter of destiny.
“I don’t think you choose the country you play for, the country chooses you,” Adamolekun said. “With the opportunity of [the Jamaican team] asking me to play, I took it and made sure to show them what I was capable of doing.”
Despite competing in the U-15, U-16 and U-17 camps for the United States in high school, Sade’s commitment to Jamaica has had a profound impact on the Adadmolekun family.
“I know it means a lot to my family — especially my mom’s side, as she’s from Jamaica,” Sade said. “So it’s definitely a huge, cool thing.” 
If Adamolekun felt any pressure playing for her family and her country, she certainly didn’t let it show on the pitch. 
Following successful stops with the U-17 and U-20 Jamaican team in 2017 and 2018, respectively, she made her debut for Jamaica’s full national team in February 2019 against Chile, started against Italy in the World Cup’s group stage and competed at the 2019 Pan American Games. 
After such a long and challenging stretch of international soccer, how did Adamolekun transition to the collegiate game? According to Trojan head coach Keidane McAlpine, she took it in stride.
“When she got to SC and got to be with us…. she had missed some key moments for us … but I thought she did an extremely good job of finding her way and taking her moments when she could to join our squad and be productive,” McAlpine said.
For Adamolekun, it was a year of transition and adjustment both on and off the pitch. Adjusting to new classes, a new city and a new team is overwhelming for many players, but Adamolekun took the challenge head on. With the support and encouragement of McAlpine, she earned her minutes and impressed with her fitness level, on-ball skill and work ethic. 
Her efforts earned her an appearance on the Pac-12 All-Freshman team and helped USC reach the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament, where the No. 9-seeded Trojans fell 3-2 to No. 2 seed UNC Chapel Hill. 
Ever the competitor, Adamolekun remains proud of her accomplishments while intensely focused on improving on last year’s results.
“I was very happy about being able to adjust and jump into [USC’s] style of play,” Adamolekun said. “We weren’t 100% [for the UNC game], and I feel we could’ve won.” 
McAlpine echoed her sentiments, hopeful that Adamolekun continues to make the physical, technical and tactical adjustments necessary to take her game to the next level. With a year of experience under her belt, McAlpine “anticipates we’ll start to see the best version of Sade next year and beyond.”
Part of Adamolekun’s growth will come from developing chemistry with her teammates, 11 of whom are in her same 2019 class. Adjusting to her new teammates’ style of play was a major focus during her freshman season, and Adamolekun hopes that groundwork will lead to a successful sophomore campaign amid the obstacles that a coronavirus-influenced season will almost certainly bring.
Isabel Rolley, a sophomore defender who missed the 2019 season due to an ankle injury, has seen firsthand Adamolekun’s efforts to ingratiate herself with her teammates and establish her role as a humble leader by example.
“She’s a positive voice [for the team] … she’s not super vocal, but when she does talk, it’s always positive,” Rolley said. “Her experience in the World Cup is something so rare for someone our age … I can see a lot of the decisions she makes on the field are very mature.” 
As for the rest of 2020 and beyond, Adamolekun’s goals remain the same: Put in the work in the (virtual) classroom and in training. Confident in USC’s health and safety protocols in the midst of the pandemic, Sade wants her work and preparation to do the talking.
“I’ve been making sure that I’m ready for everything that comes my way, whether it’s fitness, whether it’s my technical or mental ability, so just preparing in any way possible,” Adamolekun said.
Whether in front of a (likely) fanless McAlister Field or at Jamaica’s next international competition, Adamolekun’s play and future certainly look bright.

Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown and George Floyd: These are just some of the names student-athletes will carry on their backs for the 2020-21 school year. The names of 22 Black people in total killed by either police brutality or racial discrimination are etched onto the newest student-athlete backpack designed in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.
On Aug. 16, the USC Athletic Department released the backpack’s look on their social media platforms. The design, normally helmed by the Trojan Athletic Senate, was drawn up in collaboration with the United Black Student-Athletes Association. 
TAS employed executive member and senior baseball player John Thomas to draft up a concept because of his clothing design experience. Soon after, Thomas approached UBSAA officers graduate track and field athlete Anna Cockrell and senior volleyball player Candice Denny with the opportunity to put the new design on the backpacks. 
“I’m a captain of my team, Anna is the captain to her team, Candice is as well,” Thomas said. “So, as leaders of USC Athletics, we all thought it would be a really great opportunity to unapologetically state the direction we want the program to go.” 
The more than 600 USC student-athletes are usually spotted on campus by the cardinal and gold backpacks distributed to them at the beginning of each school year. Normally, the bags are a symbol to everyone on campus that a student competes for the University outside of the classroom. But this year, the designers saw an opportunity to make a new kind of statement showing where the Athletic Department stands in the wake of nationwide protests surrounding racial injustice in the United States.
The names selected are those whose killings propelled the Black Lives Matter movement to the forefront of U.S. discourse. But the designers also wanted to spotlight Black women and transgender women killed within the last decade and honor Emmett Till, whose lynching in 1955 in Money, Miss. catalyzed the Civil Rights Movement. 
“It [was] just hard to read through obituaries and choose those names,” Denny said. “But at the end of the day, those are people that we want to carry on our backs with pride, and we hope that every athlete is proud to have the backpack.”
An ‘SC logo filled by the trans-inclusive pride flag overlays the rows of names on the design. After the design’s publication on social media, some criticized that the LGBTQ+ symbolism overshadowed the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. Denny defended the decision, citing intersectionality as an important aspect of the project to ensure all Black lives are represented.
“You can’t say Black Lives Matter if you don’t recognize all the Black queer lives that also matter and are always in danger,” Denny said.
The backpack’s Instagram post has more than 1,000 comments, some of which accuse the Athletic Department of virtue signaling and ignoring the supposed “other side” of police brutality. In an email to the Daily Trojan, USC Senior Associate Athletic Director Denise Kwok reiterated the importance of the department supporting student-athletes in raising awareness of racial injustice.
“We encourage our student-athletes to use their platforms to amplify their voices regarding issues that are important to them, including in regards to social issues,” Kwok wrote. “This was an entirely student-athlete driven effort, and we were proud to support them.”
The UBSAA hopes that the backpacks will serve as a conversation starter among the USC sports community. After their distribution, Denny explained potential plans to auction off a few to those interested within the USC community and donate the funds to charity. 
Even without an on-campus appearance this semester, the backpacks serve to initiate a dialogue, one that both Thomas and Denny believe will set the standard for how USC will act in the future and what fans should expect out of the student-athletes they cheer for.
“We are so much outside of just being athletes,” Denny said. “So this backpack shows that we can have a voice, we can speak up about whatever we believe in, we can have political opinions.”
