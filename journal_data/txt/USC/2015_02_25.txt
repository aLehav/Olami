Undergraduate Student Government held a SpeakSC forum, Wednesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, to allow transfer students to discuss their experience at USC and suggest improvements.
The panel was led by Kairos Llobrera, lead academic adviser for academic counseling services through USC undergraduate programs. The discussion was moderated by Katherine Wilcox, USG assistant director of external affairs.
Many students at the forum inquired about current and future programs to be implemented for transfer students. Llobrera explained that his office is currently developing the Transformation Series, a program that intends to help transfers network or get information about programs such as study abroad, which transfers often struggle with because of their limited time before graduation.
“[The Transformation series] is a series of workshops that we’re trying to put on,” Llobrera said. “They address the more pressing issues or the more important resources that we feel that [transfer students] might need.”
One student asked Llobrera to specify which part of the transfer experience needs the most improvement. He responded by stating that it is imperative that the process of transferring units from other colleges and universities to USC be streamlined so transfer students are able to graduate on time.
“The biggest challenge that I see for transfer students is getting their transfer courses to count for USC requirements,” Llobrera said. “As an academic adviser, because we want you to graduate, for me the biggest challenge I think has been figuring out what courses you’ve taken can transfer and fulfill GE requirements because USC is an expensive place, and we want [transfer students] to get the most out of your experience here in the limited time that you are here.”
As the discussion moved to the social aspect of the transfer experience, students in the audience were asked to suggest ideas for making the transition easier for transfer students.
Alex Breitbart, a sophomore transfer from Bergen Community College, suggested that reserving a floor in current freshman dorms for transfer students would make it easier for transfers to network and gain exposure to extracurriculars.
“When you have the freshman dorm experience, you see fliers and a lot more stuff around,” Breitbart said. “You’re kind of in an environment where all of this information is readily available to you. I think [a floor exclusively for transfer students] would really be like a cure-all.”
Llobrera closed the discussion by stating that the forum provided many interesting ideas for him to work with.
“I thought the discussion was very productive and informative, especially from our side in Academic Counseling Services, to be able to craft programs and implement initiatives that would help transfer students,” he said.
According to USG Vice President and President-Elect Rini Sampath, the forum was modeled after the spring admit discussion that was held in January of last year. Sampath noted the impact that particular forum had on the creation of USG projects geared toward spring admits. She explained that she is optimistic that the transfer student forum will produce the same effect.
“I will say this past year our focus has been on spring admits, and that could probably stem from the fact that, that was our first spring admit forum that we hosted,” Sampath said. “Moving forward with the spring admit forum, we were able to take on so many projects like fall housing and the potential of integrating spring admits on campus better. But I’m really glad that this forum is taking place because it’s finally time that we started talking about transfer students.”
Sampath further noted that the timing is ideal for USG to start focusing on transfer students because the organization gained valuable experience working on programs to benefit spring admits in the last year.
“I think that we didn’t want to get too scattered in all of the different projects that we did have this past year, so it was definitely timed right in that we wanted to make transfer students a focus for the second portion of our year since we’ve worked so much bringing light to spring admit issues, so I think it’s the right time,” she said.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute hosted its weekly Students Talk Back event yesterday afternoon in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The panel was titled, “A Global Threat: The Advancing Reach of ISIS and its Domestic Implications,” and discussed how the United States should respond to the terrorist organization both at home and overseas.
Three experts on the topic were invited to USC to make up the forum’s panel: Terry McCarthy, current president and CEO of Los Angeles World Affairs Council; Seema Mehta, political reporter at the Los Angeles Times; and Shikhar Gupta, vice president of USC College Democrats.
The event was co-moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director at the Unruh Institute and Emma Peplow, news editor at the Daily Trojan.
McCarthy opened up the discussion by differentiating ISIS with other known terrorist groups. He explained how ISIS is completely unwavering in terms of negotiation.
“Other groups use violence to achieve an endgame,” McCarthy said. “ISIS does not have that political ending in sight. Their tactic is to use violence to expand their territory. There is no negotiation with ISIS, you either get on their team or they will kill you,” he said.
McCarthy explained that once individuals begin to perceive ISIS as susceptible to outside forces, they will be easier to defeat.
“The way to counter that is to stop this expansion, and at the same time undermine their message because they need to keep recruiting people to help them,” he said. “Once ISIS is seen to be vulnerable and can no longer expand their caliphate, and once their acts are seen to be acts of criminals rather than of heroes, then I think they will be defeated fairly quickly.”
McCarthy went into an in-depth discussion regarding the ISIS message and explained that in order to counteract ISIS in the Middle East, their ideology must be opposed.
“ISIS is using quotes from the Quran to justify what they are doing,” McCarthy said. “The narrative has been using Islamic vocabulary to give hope to Muslims that feel as if they have nowhere else to go.”
McCarthy continued to describe the circumstances that allowed for this narrative’s credibility.
“The idea that young Muslims don’t have anywhere to go in the Middle East under their current parastructures is quite frankly quite valid,” McCarthy said. “There aren’t jobs, the education is not there, and if you’re a woman then God help you, because you won’t be allowed to go to college, let alone drive a car.”
He said that the governmental structure in the Arab world has proven to be extremely unfair and exclusionary and how this narrative must be challenged by the Arab world.
Mehta and Gupta emphasized the domestic implications of ISIS, switching the topic of conversation toward public opinion in the United States, the effects of social media and the language political figures use in addressing ISIS.
Gupta explained that public opinion toward U.S. involvement in Iraq has drastically changed within the past four years.
“Something interesting we see is that American support for airstrikes in Iraq has been very high over the past year of so,” Gupta said. “What we’ve seen recently is that American support for ground troops in Iraq is at 57 percent, which is interesting considering the past four years since we have withdrawn troops from Iraq. That is a very quick turnaround in public opinion.”
A student in the audience then directed a question towards Gupta about the impact the media may have had on the dramatic turn in pubic opinion.
“It may have to do with the novel nature of how ISIS operates in comparison to other conventional terrorist groups because they are making tremendous ground relatively fast,” Gupta said. “I think seeing the media cover this instills fear in the public, which in turn leads to more support for action.”
The three panelists agreed that the media heavily impacts the public by showing some of the more brutal acts by ISIS. However, they recognized that the language used by political figures in the U.S. counteract the media in order to avoid discrimination domestically.
By working as a journalist on multiple presidential campaigns, Mehta is is familiar with how politicians discussed ISIS, as well as other terrorist groups.
“The president has been very careful with the language that he has used,” Mehta said. “It seems like the goal of the administrations for the past decade has been to avoid using words that make it seem like all Muslims are responsible for the terrorist acts that we have seen.”
McCarthy responded to this with a warning about various forms of intolerant language.
“In the U.S., we need to be forward-thinking, trying to create a society that can tolerate difference and even embrace it,” he said.
He continued to address the language used in the political setting.
“The words that you choose to use feed into the story that you are trying to tell,” McCarthy said. “If you’re trying to tell a story of exclusionism and superiority of one ethnic religious nationalist group over another that is a route towards violence and confrontation; if you’re trying to tell a story of inclusion and tolerance that is a completely different route. It speaks to the art of messaging.”

The Media Center in Wallis Annenberg Hall will be named the Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center following a donation of an undisclosed amount to USC.
Moonves, the president and CEO of CBS told the Daily Trojan that the Media Center will change the way student journalists tell their stories –but urged students to remain committed to the basic principles of journalism in the face of such technology.
“As much as technology has changed, and the world and how we are receiving our information in is vastly different and will become different, learn the tools of journalism,” Moonves said. “Learn how to tell the story. Learn the who, the what, the where, the when and tell it truthfully, tell it straight ahead, tell it from your point of view, because that never changes.”
The newly named 20,000-square-foot Media Center is home to Neon Tommy, Annenberg TV News and Annenberg Radio News.
Ernest J. Wilson III, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, spoke of the Media Center’s importance in shaping a generation of students in rooms that are “connectors, not containers.”
“The Annenberg center is an all-school center,” Wilson said. “This is not just a room to make the news. This a room where the next generation of newsmakers are also made.”
President C. L. Max Nikias reiterated his appreciation for Wallis Annenberg’s generosity in helping to create the space that now holds the forum and Media Center possible.
“For journalists, the search for truth, for the story, is never ending,” he said. “Even as we celebrate today this new center and its cutting edge technology, the values and educational beliefs about the proper training for journalism students remain.”
USC alumna Julie Chen, the host of CBS’s “The Talk,” “Big Brother” and CBS Morning News, praised USC at the event and said she wished she could have taken advantage of the Media Center herself.
“This school helped grow my skills as a journalist and as a broadcaster, but there was nothing like this Media Center when I was here,” she said.
Willow Bay, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism, echoed Chen’s sentiments about the powerful potential of the media center for students.
“I’m not sure we realized back then — I certainly didn’t — just how transformative this building and Media Center would be,” she said. “It’s reshaping our culture, changing how we teach and changing how our students learn.”
Sami Goldberg, a senior studying communication, said the Media Center is one of the reasons she is excited to be a student at USC.
“The Media Center that we have here at USC Annenberg is one of the reasons that this school will continue to be one of the best journalism and communication schools in the country,” she said. “The fact that we have the support of CBS, Les Moonves and Julie Chen speaks to the fact that USC Annenberg offers aspiring journalism and communication students the best opportunity for success.”
Moonves reiterated that spirit to the Daily Trojan.
“What the Media Center does is give you all the mechanisms for being out there,” he said. “This truly is better than any studio I have seen across the country. It really is extraordinary.”
In the photograph in this article, is there any reason why Julie Chen’s eyes are closed?
While I appreciate their extreme generosity in making the Center what it is…I prefer that before you have a ‘center’ named after you, you have distinguished yourself as a ‘legend’ in your field.  I have no personal grudges against them,  but perhaps I’m seeking a dose of humility.
My name is Jeff Prescott, and I’m a USC dad.
Fight On…….

Pete Carroll, current head coach of the Seattle Seahawks and former USC football coach will receive an honorary degree at the 2015 USC commencement ceremony. Carroll’s leadership has revitalized the Seahawks, who won the Super Bowl in 2014 and came a yard short of repeating as champions in 2015.
Under Carroll, the Seahawks have a 50-30 record and two NFC championships.
From 2000 to 2009, Carroll coached the USC Trojans. During his tenure with the Trojans, Carroll returned USC football to national prominence.
He led the Trojans to a BCS National Championship (now vacated), two Associated Press National Championships and five Rose Bowl appearances, but he didn’t achieve success without facing adversity first. In 2001 the Trojans went 6-6, but Carroll’s “Always Compete” philosophy and never-ending pursuit to win rejuvenated the program: USC went 67-7 over the next 74 games.
Against Notre Dame and UCLA — arguably the most important games of the year for USC — Carroll went 14-2. Carroll brought a unique spirit back to USC football, with jokes, pranks, competition and openness that fueled the team’s success.
Not only is Carroll a successful and well-respected football coach — one of a few to have won both a Super Bowl and college national championship — but he also has a passion for service. When Carroll first moved to L.A., he was compelled to take action concerning    gang-related violence.
In 2003, Carroll founded A Better LA, a charity focused on community building and gang violence prevention to empower inner-city youth and generate support from other service organizations.
After moving to Seattle, Carroll created A Better Seattle, which serves the same purpose as A Better LA.
Carroll, a dominant force both on the field and in philanthropy, is still beloved today by many USC fans.

The Trojans will play Utah State on Sept. 10, 2016, Western Michigan in their 2017 season opener on Sept. 2, and UNLV in their 2019 season opener on Aug. 31.
USC is 5-0 all-time against Utah State, with their last meeting resulting in a 17-14 USC win at the Coliseum in 2013. The Aggies finished 10-4 last season and finished third in the Mountain West with a 6-2. They’re coming off a 21-6 win over UTEP in the Gildan New Mexico Bowl. After winning a total of 23 games from 2003-10, Utah State has won 37 games since 2011.
The 2017 opener will be USC’s first game against a member of the Mid-American Conference. The Broncos finished 8-5 and 6-2, third-best in the MAC, losing 38-24 to Air Force in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. The eight wins are the most in a season for Western Michigan since 2008, when they finished 9-4.

USC athletic director Pat Haden has made a lot of momentous decisions since taking over for his predecessor Mike Garret in 2010.
In just about four and half years, Haden has hired and fired a bundle of coaches, a combined seven different head coaches at the helm of USC’s football and basketball programs. Haden has also been forced to make head coaching transitions after he deposed of former baseball coach Frank Cruz and received the resignation from former women’s basketball head coach Michael Cooper in 2013.
During his tenure thus far, Haden has evidently stayed close to home with the majority of his coaching hires, electing to go with local product Steve Sarkisian to replace the detested Lane Kiffin, a Women of Troy legend in Cynthia Cooper-Dyke to take the reins of the women’s basketball program and finally Dan Hubbs, a three-year letterman for the USC baseball team in the early 1990s, to lead a program which is now off to its best start since 1988.
There’s no doubt that these coaching decisions have paid dividends, including a Holiday Bowl victory, a nationally ranked No. 1 recruiting class and the Women of Troy’s first ever Pac-12 championship.
The only hire that hasn’t really panned out the way Haden would have liked yet is that of Andy Enfield, whose team has greatly struggled, especially in Pac-12 play, during his two seasons at the helm.
Amidst all the talk surrounding these coaches, NCAA sanctions and College Football Playoff drama, there’s no doubt that Haden has been through a lot in just under half of a decade at USC. Remember that Haden received a lot of backlash and was later reprimanded by the Pac-12 for the “inappropriate sideline conduct” he exercised toward game officials in the Trojans’ 13-10 victory over Stanford in September.
This type of criticism is to be expected when your job is to run a program as polarizing as USC’s in addition to attempting to remain impartial on a 13-person selection committee that ultimately determines the fate of college football’s finest.
Fortunately, the Trojans are in the good hands of one of the most intelligent athletic directors in the country, with Haden as a former two-time academic All-American and Rhodes Scholar.
Athletic directors and their legacies are commonly defined by the splashes they make when bringing in and tossing out coaches of their respective athletic programs — and their wins and losses are only subjected to further evaluation and scrutiny in major sports like football and basketball, rather than the number of conference and national titles non-revenue teams have collected.
Haden has made the valiant effort to turn around that culture at USC.
I don’t believe that Haden has received enough credit for what he has done to expand the athletic landscape at USC. He has taken the program from 19 to 21 intercollegiate sports and celebrated the school’s 125 years of athletic tradition during the 2013-2014 season.
In just the past three years, Haden has established two new varsity sports that were once unfamiliar to USC — sand volleyball and women’s lacrosse, a sport that had been foreign to the West Coast until recent years.
Seemingly, Haden has made a tremendous effort to turn some of the attention and awareness to sports that don’t receive as much recognition or support as football or basketball.
He can only try so hard, though, as that goal hasn’t necessarily come to fruition quite yet.
Haden has been under a lot of pressure to take the athletic program through some of its darkest years, and he has, indeed, succeeded in lifting the dark cloud that had surrounded USC for some time.
As with any type of prominent leader, it’s tough to maintain the status quo and keep your organization out of trouble when it is already in hot water while simultaneously attempting to advance it in so many different ways.
It’s truly a continuous juggling act that only someone with Haden’s capabilities could accomplish.
He rescued USC at a time when his alma mater needed him most. and by doing so, he has lifted the athletic program from the depths of NCAA sanctions and controversy.
Haden, a former lawyer, has not only kept the USC athletic program compliant and out of trouble with the NCAA for the most part, but he has also made the university more “sexy” by dropping in new athletic facilities left and right, in addition to renovating a few others.
For example, the John McKay Center, a $70 million, 110,000 square-foot facility created just for USC athletics opened up in the summer of 2012 on Haden’s watch, and it is not only one of the most revered facilities in the nation, but also a large contributor to the allure for recruits interested in USC.
Not to forget, Merle Norman Stadium, the home of USC women’s sand volleyball; the renovations of Heritage Hall and finally, the Uytengsu Aquatics Center are all venues that Haden has opened as athletic director.
After having a very successful career in the private equity industry, Haden gave up a lot to step into his role today for his alma mater including businesses that had net profits around $100 million.
Reportedly, he had even turned down the job several times before finally accepting just under five years ago——- — and USC fans should be very glad that he did.
Mr. Haden, if you’re reading this, I would just like you to know that I, along with other members of the Trojan faithful, are really proud of what you’ve done for USC during your tenure thus far and we’re looking forward to seeing all of the other magnificent things you’re able accomplish at the helm of this historic athletic program in the years to come.
Darian Nourian is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Persian Persuasion,” runs Thursdays.
Haden needs to go back to something he actually does well…color commentator for Notre Dame. As an AD he has been an utter disaster. From his capitulating and rolling over to the corrupt NCAA with his infamous apology tour of “winning the right way” to his horrible hires for SC major men’s sports teams he failed miserably. By the way he also signed off on the hire of Kiffin so he has that disaster on his hands as well. He had the opportunity to hire a proven head football coach like Stoops, Petersen, Sumlin and others but instead selected another Pete Carroll yes man with a mediocre record at UW. Naturally yes man Sark has surrounded himself with yes men on his staff which lead to SC blowing 3 games last season and nearly 2 others. Time for Haden to retire or preferably be fired.
Who the heck would want to salute Patti Haden? He’s the WORST hire for letting NZAA get away from us and hiring leaping Sark.
I can’t believe what I am reading. The statement Haden made “We will win the right way” after the sanctions were levied floored many who still  believe we were winning the right way. The basketball team is in last place, the baseball team has beaten a bunch of cupcakes. The football team has been average at best for a USC team. How low our standards have become.
Pat Haden is overpaid and over-rated.  I also don’t care for his oft-stated allegiance to Notre Dame. He needs to go back to broadcasting their games and let USC move on with better leadership.
You must be looking at his accomplishments with blinders. The Men athletic program has been heading downwards other
than tennis and water polo with the coaches well established before Haden took the job. The jury is still out on baseball until
the team makes the ncaa tournament. Getting a top recruiting class in football means what unless it translate onto the field of
play.  Basketball has reached bottom the last two seasons. Don’t talk for the other Trojan faithful unless you talk to them, and
get some real feedback. Haden will not be around in years to come as AD.

Sophomore guard Julian “Juju” Jacobs says that his team’s struggles over his two years with the program have been one of the toughest times of his career.
The road has, indeed, been tough for the Trojans, who are 10-18 overall and 2-14 in conference play, putting them at dead last in the Pac-12, though there seems to be at least one guiding light through Jacobs.
Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, JuJu is a product of the east side of the city. Standing 6’4, he is one of the most athletic and explosive point guards one will encounter at the Division 1 level. Jacobs prepped at Desert Pines High School, a basketball powerhouse in Las Vegas.
In his junior year of high school, he began to make a name for himself, leading the Jaguars to a state title run but ultimately falling short. In his senior year, however, he came back with a vengeance, leading the Jaguars to a state championship with a 27-3 record, averaging 16.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 3.2 steals per game — leading the team in all categories.
As a result of his spectacular season, he was named to the All-State team and the Las Vegas Review-Journal Player of the Year.
Despite these accolades, Jacobs is one of the most humble athletes one could ever encounter. Well-mannered and soft-spoken, Jacobs usually keeps to himself, preferring to just “handle [his] business”.
Jacobs is not the type of athlete that you will catch at the upcoming party or on the social scene, but rather in the gym working hard on his craft to achieve his goal of one day playing in the NBA.
He learned to play basketball from one of his close friends when he was a young kid and Jacobs recalled his friend being cocky and arrogant, saying that “it worked for him because that was his personality.”
At the same time, he remembered seeing people’s negative reaction to his friend’s cockiness, so he made it a point to be a low-key person who never said a word while playing basketball; but always got the job done, and thus far, it has worked for him.
Jacob’s agility and dynamic hustle on the court positions him to have a promising career. Through his transition from high school to the college game, he has learned to be a more cerebral player, as he describes it.
“A huge transition for me at first, you know, from my freshman year, was the physicality and the pace of the game,” Jacobs said.
His acute knowledge of the game is what has enabled him to learn and adjust to different positions, as well as build team chemistry. While Jacobs may put in the extra time to work on enhancing his play as an individual, his leadership sheds light on his true character.
This past summer, Jacobs stayed at USC to perfect his craft. His teammates and coaches quickly took notice of his hard work and dedication to greatness, awarding him the position of team captain in only his second year with the team.
“I don’t want to say it fell into my hands but there was definitely an opportunity for me to take on that role because there was a large group of freshman coming in and I was one of the staples from last year,” Jacobs said. “I honestly worked my butt off this summer and I felt like I deserved it.”
Staying true to his character, Jacobs claimed how humbling and gratifying it was to be recognized for his efforts so early on in his career at USC.
The Trojans’ season is nearly over, and though they won’t go anywhere this year, they have a core group filled with young talent, and a good group of recruits coming in next year.
In the face of such adversity, one would think a player of such talent would get fed up and transfer to a place where he feels he could compete and contend, but not Jacobs.
“I think the most important thing is to have the support system, certain friends and family that always keep you going and remind you why you’re there,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs is, indeed, here to stay and with his talent and positive attitude at the helm, Trojan’s basketball team can only go up from here.
Beyond USC, Jacobs noted that he definitely has aspirations of playing in the NBA.
“I’ve always been a firm believer [that] if you’re really confident in your Plan A and you do everything to make that happen, it’ll come to fruition,” Jacobs said. “So, not that I’m banking on going to the NBA but I just strongly believe that I will play in the NBA one day and through that I’ll meet people I couldn’t even dream of meeting and so through basketball find something [more impactful] down the road.”
In the long run, Jacobs hopes to make an impact larger than himself.
Using basketball as a platform, he hopes to give back to young black males from his hometown of Las Vegas.
“I feel like when you’re on a stage like the NBA, you have a voice, and I always felt like I could connect with any kind of people and so like I said, [I] just [want to] find something applicable after basketball — through basketball actually.”
With the  talent and humility of Jacobs at the forefront of the program, the Trojan’s future looks very bright.

The USC women’s basketball team will finish up their regular season this weekend as they take on Washington on Thursday, Feb. 26 in Seattle at 6 p.m. and Washington State on Saturday, Feb. 28 in Pullman at 3 p.m.
The Women of Troy (15-12, 7-9 Pac-12) split their final two home games of the season against the Arizona schools, crushing Arizona 77-51 but falling to No. 12 Arizona State 76-73 in double overtime.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama tallied 28 points and 15 rebounds in her final two games, picking up the fifth double-double of her career on Senior Day with a 18-point, 12-rebound performance against the Sun Devils.
“I think we need to just execute more as a team,” junior guard Brianna Barrett said. “Positive things we can take away are effort, we never gave up, and I think we saw as a team that we can play with the best of the best, and when we take from that we have confidence in ourselves, and in our abilities as a team. We just use that momentum going into this weekend.”
Senior forward Kaneisha Horn had 15 points and 11 rebounds over the weekend. Freshmen also made some major contributions for USC, as guard McKenzie Calvert scored 22 points, while forward Kristen Simon racked up 21 points and a team-leading 18 rebounds.
Vaioletama leads USC with 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.
Calvert is averaging 10.3 points per game, while Horn is scoring 10.1 points per game, and leads the team with 7.0 rebounds per game. Vaioletama has the rebounding advantage in Pac-12 games though, 7.6 to 7.3 per game.
The Women of Troy have been led by their offensive rebounding this season, leading the Pac-12 with 14.8 per game and placing second in offensive rebounding percentage at .354.
They’ve tallied 20 or more offensive rebounds in four games this season and grabbed 19 against the Sun Devils.
The Huskies (20-8, 9-7 Pac-12) are led by Kelsey Plum’s 22.9 points per game.
Jazmine Davis is averaging 15.6 points and a team-leading 4.3 assists per game, while Talia Walton averages 13.5 points and 5.7 rebounds per game.
Plum is also the Pac-12’s leading scorer in conference games, averaging 20.2 points per game. USC is 29-31 all-time against Washington, having lost their last two meetings.
Lia Galdeira leads the Cougars (15-12, 6-10 Pac-12) with 19.6 points per game, including 19.9 in conference, second only to Plum, along with 6.0 rebounds per game. Galdeira also leads the team in assists with 70, and steals with 90.
Tia Presley is averaging 16.4 points for Washington State. The Women of Troy are 44-15 all-time against the Cougars, but have also lost the past two meetings.
“I think the key is to contain,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said about defending Plum and Galdiera. “We’re not going to be able to stop the scoring guards, but we can contain them and limit their touches. The way you contain a scorer is to make them work extremely hard on offense to get the ball, and then you make them work extremely hard on defense. We’re going to have to value the ball, not turn it over, make them play some defense, and then contain their penetration and contest their 3-point shot.”
The two teams split a home-and-home last weekend, with the Cougars winning 83-72 in Seattle on Friday behind 23 points from Galdiera, while the Huskies blew out the Cougars 83-43 in Pullman on Sunday behind 22 points each from Plum and Walton.
The Huskies enter the weekend having won four of their last six, while the Cougars have lost six of their last eight.
The Women of Troy will return to Seattle next week, as they’ll participate in the Pac-12 tournament from Thursday, March 5 to Sunday, March 8 at KeyArena.

My professor meant the question as a quick icebreaker, a way for everyone to share about themselves: “OK, everyone, name your favorite place in Los Angeles.”
Maybe I was tired from a day full of icebreakers, maybe I just wanted to shake up a dull class, but for whatever reason, my automatic answer was “Nazi camp.”
Obviously, this prompted questions. What should have been a five-minute activity turned into my 15 minutes of fame, as I spent that much time explaining the lore of Los Angeles’ very own abandoned Nazi compound to a room full of strangers.
Nazi camp is my favorite Los Angeles secret; a “secret” that I constantly blab about, clearly. The intended grandiose command center is now scattered, with decrepit structures hidden in Murphy Ranch near the upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood.
Unfortunately, you need a car to access the compound. Exit the 405 North on Sunset Boulevard, then drive west until Capri Drive. Parking is free, albeit tricky, as it is in a residential area. At the end of the street is a fire road that marks the beginning of the trail.
Previously, when asked about the compound, I simply passed on what I’d heard, pretending I knew what I was talking about. I was afraid that the story I’d originally heard was too weird to be true, so I never actually researched the alleged Nazi compound. Instead, I threw out vague explanations.
For the purpose of journalistic ethics, I finally looked into the compound’s origins for this column. I emailed the president of Pacific Palisades, hoping to score a tell-all interview on the true story of the destroyed buildings. He didn’t respond, so I approached this like a research paper. I thoroughly combed through online sources, articles and Yahoo Answers! sections and summarized my findings.
In the 1930s, Murphy Ranch was owned by Winona and Norman Stephens. A German named Herr Schmidt, who claimed to have supernatural powers, convinced the couple that once Germany won World War II, the Nazi community would need a hidden command center in the United States. The Stephens proceeded to spend about $4 million, possibly with funding from Germany, on a large compound. The intended command center includes water and fuel tanks, a power station and other infrastructure. Plans for a four-story mansion never came to fruition, as funds dried up and federal agents eventually arrested Schmidt.
The property was then purchased by the Huntington Hartford Foundation and transitioned into an artist’s colony until the 1970s. Today, it remains an artists’ haven — for taggers. Old buildings are coated with layers of graffiti, creating plenty of Instagram opportunities.
When I first visited three years ago, the compound’s eeriness was multiplied by its emptiness. We were the only ones in the crumbling compound. Now, perhaps due to media attention and the increasing popularity of urban exploration, the area is crowded with locals and tourists alike. An Australian tourist explained that “Nazi camp” popped up when he researched Los Angeles tourist attractions. I responded politely, but in my head, I was aghast; the secret Nazi camp — a tourist attraction?
The hike to the buildings is not difficult. After walking along the fire road for about a mile, a break in the chain link fence leads you to the stairs. The stairs, 500 strong and sans railing, comprise the hike’s biggest challenge. Even though the actual hike is only a few miles, the stairs kept our legs sore for days.
After defeating the stairs, you can spend as much or as little time as you want exploring the grounds. Just left of the stairs is arguably the camp’s most photo-worthy building, the powerhouse. The graffitied structure is sturdy enough to climb, and the inside contains an electrical box and catwalk. Outside the powerhouse is a raised garden area, meticulously planned.
I wish I could offer you a comprehensive map of all the camp’s remaining structures, but because I’m geographically challenged, I wander aimlessly. On this trip, we found an old barn complete with stables. A graffiti artist showed us his just-finished work, and we tentatively visited the second floor, on the verge of collapse
If you can’t handle climbing back up the stairs, you can follow the road back out through the original entry gate. A second set of stairs offers access to a huge water tower and panoramic views that prompted my friend from the East Coast, Nicole, to exclaim, “There’s no way this is natural!”
The Nazi camp is one of my worst-kept secrets. A perfect daytime adventure, the trip is full of weird history and photo-ops. Trust me, it’s a great conversation starter.

“I have a hard time accepting diversity as a synonym for justice.” – Dr. Angela Davis
When a legend speaks, it’s best to listen. Around 850 people lined up to spend an evening with civil rights leader Dr. Angela Davis on Monday evening, many of them students, many of them grateful members of the surrounding community. I myself stood for nearly two hours for a chance to hear the words of this historical Revolutionary.
Dr. Davis’ profundity and honesty were astounding. In a country obsessed with upholding “political correctness,” I was refreshed to hear a powerful woman speak her mind. I was particularly impressed by the quote above, one of many statements for which the African American-dominated audience cheered.
Diversity has become a two-edged sword where demographics are concerned. People often assume that variation is the same as equality, which allows the unconcerned majority to turn a blind eye to any inequalities. According to Dr. Davis, people would rather declare us all equal than work to make that declaration reality.
“Diversity is difference that makes no difference at all,” Dr. Davis said.
We are not a post-racial society so long as anyone thinks that we are. I am exceedingly proud to be part of such a wonderfully diverse campus, but we must remember that diversity is merely a stepping-stone to justice. USC has a long way to go, but this is a student body capable of great things and positive progress.
Angela Davis lead radical charges for civil rights in her day, and I believe what’s important to take away from her inspiring message is this: There are still battles to be won.
Fight on.

1. Appearance is everything. 

Welcome to the business and professional world, where that piece of paper you worked for four years for comes second to what kind of socks you are wearing. Just kidding — when dressing for a professional event or workday, dress to impress. You must embody the physicality of professional and success people (old rich white guys that were born wearing a blazer and swaddled by a cover letter). There are rules when it comes to dressing up for work:
2. How to Introduce Yourself.
The first thing stated in any professional setting is ‘tell me about yourself’ phrased as a question. All networking events consist of having the same conversation over and over and over again. The formula for a response to this question is as follows: “I’m Jill, and I am a junior at the University of Southern California studying International Relations with an emphasis in pre-law. I am really passionate about [enter useless cause] and I want to work as [enter unattainable career goal] as demonstrated by my internship [where I honed in my ability to buy coffee and fake laugh]. Or you could be honest:

3. Know your Audience.
There are two types of people in the professional world, A) people who like ‘numbers’ a.k.a. those who actually read The New York Times and whose ringtone is the stock exchange bell

or B) Communication majors who work to keep up with their Nekter tab.

4. Bring in your Resume
As an owner of your very own resume, you automatically fulfill the minor requirements for a degree in Creative Writing. Go Dornsife! Also, take into account the amount of time spent working on projects and jobs and realize you do this just to put it on a piece of paper. While searching for self-validation in your resume, make sure to keep it to a page maximum and be professional:

5. Do the Penelope.
At networking events and job interviews, sprinkle in your accomplishments nonchalantly amid conversation. For example:
Business Professional: The sky is blue.
You: Wow! That is so crazy. We have so much in common. Graduating magna cum laude at the University of Southern California, I was the second in my class and president of my fraternity, B.R.O. I just took a protein shot while wearing a blue mood ring.
Business Interviewer: What are your weaknesses?
You: I just love to work. It’s crazy! I take on so much, and I am a perfectionist. I work too hard. I am too good at my job. [internally: Weaknesses include trust issues, frat boys, pizza, and anything that starts with the letter Q. Anxiety ensues as I ask myself ‘why would you ask me this trap of a question?’]
Don’t forget your resume is a monologue (probably because half the things you listed aren’t real). You are performing 24/7 playing a 20-something-year-old who knows what he or she is doing. Show off your acting skills in a completely natural, unforced way:

6. Don’t be yourself. 
Cool it with the sarcasm; you are not funny anyway. Do not bring up topics about race, religion, ethnicity, politics, sexual orientation, drugs, alcohol, music preference, current events, night blindness, food, chairs, bricks, your a capella group or anything related to these categories directly and indirectly. Try not to breathe as much and realize no one cares about your opinion. And act like you care.


7. Work on your Linked In account. 
There is nothing more pathetic than the Linked In biography you have write for yourself.
Jill Bill is a junior studying International Relations at the University of Southern California. Her unwavering dedication to her education and vocational pursuits are evident in her work at said nameless, grassroots organization. She is really passionate about a random cause she did a 5k for. She participated in said conference ran by her friend’s dad in Sacramento, California. She studied abroad at the American University in Paris where she dropped her classes upon arrival. She is very involved in general activities. She loves to refer to herself in third person.
Please make sure your Linked In picture is not the same profile pictured you used on your Tinder account. No one will swipe right for unprofessionalism.

8. Stay in touch. 
After all, you never know the next time you might want to use someone. This is heart and soul of networking! Networking is a series of conversations in which you put as much B.S. into connecting with someone as you can. Your rehearsed filler conversations and jokes about the weather are your way of getting your foot in the door. Be personal, interested and professional in e-mails, phone calls, or in person visits.

Living in a college dorm or apartment is often not “eco-friendly.” The green lifestyle is a difficult and sometimes expensive endeavor. With convenience and comfort driving the average college student’s way of life, being environmentally friendly can take a “back burner” position. However, there are many ways that college students can “go green” and practice a more earth-friendly way of living for considerably little time and money.
When living in buildings with many other inhabitants and extensive use of resources, simply making sure to turn off lights when leaving and conserving energy can be an easy and far-reaching way of keeping “green.” One should also be an informed consumer. LED lighting and power-saving electrical strips are cheap and easy to attain products that make energy conservation more feasible. According to Energystar.gov, a consumer guide for energy efficient products funded by Environmental Protection Agency, these simple measures can reduce electricity use by 50-75 percent.
Despite most universities adopting a more electronically driven approach to submission of papers and material dispersal, paper waste is still omnipresent in college. In classes, professors and students can work together to find electronic ways of submission and transfer of handouts and other works that professors need to deliver to a wide number of students. A system of this sort would reduce the amount of wasted printer paper and encourage the wiser use of printers.
Paper waste also comes as an issue within the dorm rooms. Although paper towels, plates and other kitchenware are extremely convenient for the on-the-go student, they create unnecessary waste. Spending $10 to $20 on a few dishes and cloth towels can alleviate kitchen paper product waste.
Washington D.C.’s American University, for example, pledged in 2013 to have zero waste by 2020, a feat only possible due to the composting program throughout the university. Because of this program, AU is already two-thirds of the way towards reaching their goal of waste reduction.
Aside from the obvious waste of paper, water is another resource that is currently over-used and its conservation is overlooked by college students. Though it seems easy to just keep water running in the bathroom while one brushes teeth, turning off the water while shaving and face-washing can make a huge impact on water conservation.
University of California, Santa Barbara has also taken water conservation very seriously. It has reduced its water use by 20 percent before its goal date of 2020 through one of the most extensive water management plans in the country. The school has even set a new plan to reduce its water consumption by another 20 percent before 2028.
Though hallmates banging on shower doors might make it difficult to spend too long in the shower if you live in a dorm, Living Green and Saving Energy, an environmental resource, estimates that cutting shower time down by four minutes would save 3640 gallons of water a year.  Especially in a dorm where so many people are using water all at one time, simply shutting off the faucet a little bit sooner can help save a surprising amount of water.
“I used to take really long showers and waste so much water,” said Robyn To, a sophomore majoring in computer science (games). “[Now] in our apartment, me and my roommates try and keep our water use in check by taking shorter showers and turning off the faucet if it isn’t needed for immediate use.
To called for a program within his residence building to advocate for smart water usage.
“I wish we could start some sort of initiative for our whole building here because I think it could really make a huge difference if we could inspire people in our greater community to think twice before wasting water that is becoming increasingly harder to get, especially here in California,” he said.
But it doesn’t just stop at water. Plastic waste is another issue that often goes overlooked. Though going to the vending machine for a bottle of water or soda seems convenient, investing in a reusable water bottle cuts down on the amount of plastic waste produced around the entire university.
When plastic objects must be used for kitchen utensils and dishes, it is important to recycle whenever possible. Many universities have trouble enforcing recycling programs since students don’t always take the time to separate out recyclables from regular trash.
It seems that the only way to go green as a college student involves reducing, reusing and recycling materials that threaten the environment and the precarious state of resources. Being conscious and informed about food products is also an important part of being green however.
“I think living where we do makes it so easy to be more conscious of your food options,” said Emma Suffridge, a sophomore majoring in communication. “Being able to go to local farmers markets and support organic and environmentally conscious businesses and food producers is so convenient.”
Sustainable seafood is another important part of living a green lifestyle. Many types of fish are farmed and caught in a way that leads to environmental degradation. Species such as sea bass and red snapper are very often associated with unsustainable practices of fishing. Making sure to read the labels and be educated about what species of fish are caught with sustainable practices are easy ways to make sure what you are eating is safe for the environment.
Decreasing meat consumption is also a way to promote a green lifestyle. Raising large animals such as cows and pigs puts great strain on the environment and leads to the emissions of large amounts of greenhouse gasses. Consuming meat such as chicken and other poultry requires significantly less environmental strain, saving the atmosphere from the emission of greenhouse gasses that contribute to global warming.
Sewanee University of the South has created a program that encourages students to be more conscious about their food choices.  They have opened a farm that produces locally and consciously grown organic foods served in dining halls across campus.
If all else fails, getting involved on campus is a great way to find out and to be educated about going green within a university setting. Organizations and clubs such as the Environmental Affairs Organization and the Environmental Student Assembly help to guide and develop students into environmentally sustainable and proactive students. Getting involved in a student organization with other young people can often provide the education and drive for students to become more “green friendly” in a college setting.

It’s easy to spot a trend when it makes its way into popular music, and hookup culture is no exception to this. The Wombats, a well-known British alternative-pop band, released “Jump into the Fog,” a song based entirely on a hookup. “It’s not a big problem with me, love. You don’t look that hygienic anyway. I’m only here because I want to twist the structure of my average day,” the lead singer croons. But for something that is largely represented in media, it’s difficult to pinpoint the causes and forms of hookup culture.
“We don’t date before getting into relationships and we really don’t date in general. I feel like it also has to do with the fact that we talk about our sexual and personal relationships a lot, maybe unnecessarily, and when a lot of people are talking about it all at once, regardless of the context, it seems like everyone’s doing it” said John Ingram, a senior majoring in sociology.
Last year, Time magazine wrote an article about hookup culture based on a study by the University of Portland. The article, entitled “Another Study Shows That ‘Hookup Culture’ Is a Myth” states, “A study published in the Journal of Sex Research compares a survey on sexual practices from 1988-1996 to one from 2004-2012. Researchers from the University of Portland found that respondents from the later survey did not report more sexual partners after the age 18, more frequent sex or more partners during the past year than respondents from the earlier survey.”
So if young people aren’t any more promiscuous than they were a few decades ago, why does it seem as though there are fewer people in committed relationships?  The culture of courting and romancing has turned into a culture of casually fading from a hookup to a relationship. The notion still prevails whether or not it’s as true as people think.
“I think hookup culture definitely exists and continues to grow in popularity for millenials. A variety of apps like Tinder, Blendr, Grindr and J-swipe are changing the way people think about hooking up, becoming less taboo and less of a serious commitment,” said Ryan Bernstein, a junior            philosophy, politics and law major.
Nowadays, any form of romantic or sexual relationships can utilize a plethora of online sites and mobile apps to find their next partner. Tinder, one of the most well-known hookup apps, was estimated to have more than 50 million active users in 2014. Many other apps such as Grindr, DOWN and Pure, exist to connect people with others who share at least one commonality: the desire to get laid. The perception of these apps as being for hookups only ensures that those seeking more commitment are less likely to use them. Their hookup nature is aided by the fact that the primary information provided about each person is a picture of him or her. Even for those not interested in online platforms, this popularity of these apps represents an evolution of dating and courtship methods. Nowadays, students, and society, are less restrictive about their boundaries and requirements and more open to discussing these things with others.
“People drink at parties to get wasted and forget about everything and have a good time with friends. And it definitely helps people feel more comfortable hooking up,” Monica Godecki said, a freshman majoring in business administration.
In addition to the lessening of inhibitions in sexual mentalities, the use of the alcohol has been a great contributor. A study done by the Journal of Sex Research on the sexual events of 300 college women found that “alcohol use was not very common during romantic sex: 20 percent of romantic encounters involved some drinking and only five percent involved heavy drinking (defined as four or more drinks). Hookups, on the other hand, were a different story: women drank during 53 percent of their hookups, and drank heavily during 38 percent of all hookups.”
Whether or not you believe hookup culture exists, it’s undeniable that the dating game has evolved. Between technological advances, drinking and an increase in the amount of women attending universities, college students are adapting to the ever-changing world by being more open and less rigid about their sexual experiences.

Imagine a fun, blonde 26-year-old former sorority girl and current MBA student at the Marshall School of Business. Words like “peppy,” “social” and “hardworking” might come to mind. She also happens to be stylish with an affinity for the unusual, an avid Instagrammer and a dedicated runner. This might all seem run-of-the-mill for the overachievers that fill every classroom at USC. This particular woman, however, warrants another adjective: survivor. Just last year, she had her second open-heart surgery — the result of being born with a congenital heart disease.
Heidi Burns had her first open-heart surgery just five days after she was born to fix the transposition of the greater blood vessels in her heart. Afterward, she led a completely normal childhood save for annual visits to a cardiologist. She played sports, traveled and enjoyed milestones like prom and getting into her dream school. But, it didn’t take her long to realize that other people sitting in her cardiologist’s waiting room didn’t have the same lucky story.
In 2014, Burns founded her company, Project Happy Hearts — a clothing brand that donates proceeds from every purchase to hospital heart centers. She began by taking photos of people holding up signs asking “What Makes Your Heart Happy,” and soon began printing comfy and stylish T-shirts emblazoned with a confident “I woke up this happy” message.
“I decided to pull out my 401k and get skin in the game,” Burns said. “Starting at Marshall really helped me understand the business side of it.”
Completely healthy now, Burns is cautious of anyone adhering too hard to the story of her health — for her, Project Happy Hearts is about every child who is still fighting heart disease and aims to inspire everyone to live happier and healthier lives.
On the business side of things, Burns has faced a lot of adversity as a female entrepreneur.
“It’s a boys club out there,” Burns said. “For example, while my company’s name does start with the word Project, it’s not my project; it’s my company and a lot of the time, people assume that it’s just something I’m doing on the side.”
She credits her success not only to hard work, but to standing out and knowing what she’s talking about.
“I never try and dress provocatively — but I do try and stand out,” Burns said. “That’s why I’m always wearing a unique jacket or a different kind of hat; it’s a good identifier. Also, I make sure I know exactly what I’m talking about before I go into a meeting; that’s where the Marshall education has been so useful.”
Burns, an avid fashion lover who says she has been stylish since the age of 3, gets the majority of her social media marketing through Instagram. She recognizes the viral power of the platform and utilizes it for all of its benefits. A quick glance at both her @hideebee and @project_happyhearts Instagram feeds show that Burns and her team of millennials are well-versed in effective social media marketing.
Project Happy Hearts is growing from a clothing brand into a full-blown lifestyle brand.
“We’re creating a product right now that I can’t quite tell you about,” Burns said. “We’re going through the patent process right now — but it will be available in hospital gift shops everywhere.”
Her goals surpass that of rallying people behind a worthy cause — more children die of heart disease than all cancers combined, according to Project Happy Hearts.  She wants to inspire people to change the way they live their lives and encourage people to live happily.
Project Happy Hearts’s hashtag #whatmakesyourhearthappy is attached to pictures of Heidi and her friends doing things they love: spending time with family, traveling and hanging out in beautiful cities. Project Happy Hearts encourages people to live beautiful lives because life is short and precious, and not enough people remember that.
To commemorate American Heart Month, Project Happy Hearts is donating a large check to The Children’s Heart Foundation on Friday. To make a contribution or purchase clothing, head to projecthappyhearts.com.

“I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement/and now we headed towards the tallest skyscrapers,” Big Sean muses on “Dark Sky,” the opening track to his third studio album, Dark Sky Paradise.
Sean sounds hungry – after four mixtapes and two studio albums he still feels like he has something to prove with this release. He has had moderate radio success up to this point, with his highest charting songs coming not from his solo efforts, but from his contribution to G.O.O.D. Music (his label) posse bangers.
Still, Sean has yet to be accepted by the hip-hop community as a heavyweight of the new class of rap giants, a group that includes Kendrick Lamar, Drake and J.Cole. Sean, however, puts himself in that group without hesitation.
“I think I’m top tier. I’m bringing it,” he asserted in an interview with the Breakfast Club yesterday morning. With Paradise, Sean certainly helps his case, but he is still not quite the elite he views himself to be.
Dark Sky Paradise follows Sean’s Hall of Fame, which was widely considered to be an average effort that undoubtedly got outshined by Kendrick Lamar’s provocative verse in Control. Paradise got off on a much better foot thanks to the massive success of the album’s first lead single, “I Don’t F—k With You,” which landed a number 11 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. This is by far the highest position a Big Sean single has enjoyed on the Hot 100, and for good reason. Sean shows a great deal of personality with this track – his lyrics are not the most eloquent, but they’re clever, and his high-pitched delivery pairs perfectly with DJ Mustard’s signature pulsating synth line.
The two tracks before IDFWU – “Blessings” and “All Your Fault” – are among Sean’s best ever. “All Your Fault” features Ye and Sean trading witty bars about their success in the music industry over production by West and Travi$ Scott. The beat is the album’s finest; it showcases Kanye’s knack for sampling, hard-hitting drums, and deep, low-hanging synths that give the track a great bottom-end. Similarly, “Blessings” delivers with a solid hook and verse by Drake and minimalistic production that complements Drake and Sean’s deliveries. However, after the album’s fourth track – IDFWU – Paradise loses its consistency and often dips into mediocrity.
Tracks five through twelve are hit-or-miss, and the highs don’t match those of the album’s first four songs. Sean often finds himself outshined by his expensive production. He doesn’t rely primarily on his beats, like Migos or Rich Homie Quan do, but he also isn’t driven by lyrical prowess, like east-coast traditionalist Joey Bada$$. As a result, Sean is often caught in limbo, making for some uninteresting material. He rarely explores substantial topic matter, and one of the few times he does – on the track “Deep” – he throws all subtlety out the window by repeatedly exclaiming, “that sh—t get deep.” The album finishes somewhat strongly with “One Man Can Change the World,” an ode to Sean’s grandmother who recently passed, and “Outro,” which feels liked a funk-filled victory lap, but these songs are not memorable enough to redeem the album for its unexceptional middle portion
Still, with the dark album artwork, clean production, and thunderstorm motif heard throughout the album, Paradise creates an aesthetic that makes it Sean’s most focused release to date. He still has a ways to go, but one gets the feeling that Big Sean’s best days are ahead of him.
6.5/10

It has been one year since the conflict in Ukraine began and little progress has been made in the Eastern European country. Peace negotiations between the leaders of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine left all parties involved with a bitter taste in their mouths, as they agreed to a 15- to 45-mile buffer zone but failed to touch base on when to pull out weapons. Violence still prevails despite a cease-fire.
A year ago, Ukraine was a stable constitutional republic, slated to host the 2015 FIBA EuroBasket basketball tournament and boasting one of the world’s largest exportation of grain. Today, civil unrest in the country is widespread and Russia continues to wage a belligerent campaign to retrieve some of its former Soviet Union land, with the territory of Crimea already annexed. The conflict underscores the glaring remnants of a post-Cold War narrative that continues to seep its 20th century roots into the 21st century geo-political discourse. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has struggled to maintain its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, which is mostly comprised of its former satellite countries and territories. With waves of democratization and implementation of neo-liberalist policies throughout the end of the 20th century, countries like Ukraine began to become more European, looking to the West for nation-building and economic support.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demonstrated his desire to make his country the world power it was decades ago. With Crimea under his belt and violence raging in Ukraine, Putin’s Russia is built around antiquated parameters of annexation and imperialism that pose grave dangers to the international community. Recently, he has looked to both traditional and non-traditional allies to bolster his seat on the world stage. He met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to reclaim a relationship with the North African country stemming from post-Cold War dialogue. Additionally, increasing economic and diplomatic ties with China has presented both parties with an opportunity to accelerate growth. Russia, a country rich in natural sources such as oil, looks to benefit from China’s markets, capital and investments. Through this symbiotic relationship that could have long-lasting political ramifications and heavily alter the balance of power in international supremacy, Putin looks to parlay his diplomatic repertoire into a critical victory in Ukraine.
The current crisis requires a swift and decisive resolution. As long as artillery continues to fire across opposition lines, the borders continue to blur; parties involved disagreed on responsibility for the conflict and no one stands to gain,  politically or diplomatically.
The issue at hand for peace brokers should center not on pointing out who the aggressor is. Rather, the stasis of negotiations should center on instituting lasting peace, creating an effective cease-fire, building a strong and united coalition, as well as respecting the autonomy of Ukraine as an independent nation.
The situation in Ukraine is a model for the perils and dangers that come with diplomacy and international relations. Thousands have died in Ukraine’s violent protests, which in turn have spawned this seemingly interminable series of bloodshed and chaos. This is no time for international politics — which is to say, the gamesmanship seasoned politicians are accustomed to has no place on the negotiating table in Paris.
The chaos in Ukraine persists, and as the scene of violence continues to play out on the world stage, the major actors must do something proactive lest the entire theater begin to break down.

Various well-known universities around the United States have recently reaffirmed their stance on employee-student relationships. According to a recent Los Angeles Times article published this month, taking such action is pertinent, as these types of relations should not be allowed on college campuses. Universities, including USC, have policies that frown upon professor-student relationships, but do not strictly ban such practices. Furthermore, while the University of California sees “[professors] entering into a romantic or sexual relationship with any student … as unacceptable,” the California State University does not have any policy regarding relationships between undergraduates and professors.
Universities across the United States, however, such as Yale University and the University of Connecticut, have finally started to restrict such relations. Oddly enough, though the American Association of University Professors in Washington notes that relationships “between professors and students are ripe for exploitation, and faculty members should take steps to ensure unbiased evaluation of the student,” the organization does not outright ban such relations. In fact, the organization strongly feels that while these types of relationships must require as many ethical checks where possible, prohibiting them does not seem appropriate.
Policies banning such relationships must be seen as a necessary precaution, as “these relationships may put either party at risk [or] can create a perceived lack of freedom given meaningful consent about the relationships,” according to the SCampus. Furthermore, these kinds of relationships can create a huge disparity in power between both individuals, which can lead to damaging academic and psychological effects for both the student and the professor. Such effects for the student could include exploitation by the professor and non-consensual sexual intercourse, isolation from friends and family stemming from guilt over the risque relationship and biased grading that leads to either an unwarranted deflation or inflation in the student’s grade. Additionally, the professor is jeopardizing his or her academic career. Even if the university the professor teaches at does not ban employee-student relations, said professor may be fired or forced to transfer schools. According to Billie Wright Dziech, a University of Cincinnati professor who studies abusive relationships, “relationships between faculty and students can be abusive,” though they are often romanticized in fiction. She notes that “some schools have a tiny minority of professors who use their popularity and prestige to empower themselves, and students respond to it.”
Opponents of such policies mention that the potential for abuse is drastically eliminated if the student is in a different major than the professor’s area of study or if the student will never partake in any of the instructor’s classes. Though this might sound like a simple solution, they would first require the university to be aware of any relationships between a student and a professor. This rarely happens because such relations are almost taboo on college campuses and viewed in a negative light. Therefore, to implement a policy to allow these relationships to exist and to ensure that the professor and student never had any contact within a classroom would require a huge amount of effort on behalf of the university. Ultimately, the university does not gain any benefit from allowing its students to partake in any kind of sexual or romantic relationship with a professor.
Regardless of whether it is a private or public school, universities should have the final say in what policies are enacted. These types of relationships not only affect the individuals involved in the affair and university officials, but also can negatively impact the overall student population. Rumors, regardless of their truth, could damage a professor or student’s reputation, limit the opportunities for leadership and social events for the student, or make other students’ weary of taking a certain professor’s class. Such relationships also harm the university’s image and reputation, as parents or guardians  might not want to send their children to a school where students engage in romantic relationships with professors. For professors and students, romance should not be in the air.

A recent Facebook hiccup caused the accounts of some Native Americans to be banned when names such as “Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes” and “Parmelee Kills the Enemy” were deemed fictitious.
This has caused activists to take legal action against the Facebook corporation. According to The Guardian, Dana Lone Hill found her account deactivated after she changed her name on the account from her mother’s name, Lone Hill, to reflect her father’s name, Lone Elk. “I want to bring this lawsuit for Native America because these are our real names, these are the names we were given, these were the names we were born with,” Lone Hill said.
As a result of Facebook neglecting to verify their names, Native American users, including Lone Hill, had to show proof of verification to the social media company in order to reinstate their accounts — with varying degrees of success.
The incident showed that even for billion-dollar companies like Facebook, it can be challenging to cater to the specific needs and characteristics of their users, even with all of the resources they have at their disposal. While the Internet and other technological advancements have made it possible to connect millions of people from around the world, the immense number of people is exactly what makes it so hard to create a personalized experience for every user, or in this case, some Native Americans. This is important given that social media interaction has grown tremendously over the past couple of years.
For Native Americans, or any person, really, a name is an important part of identity. When companies like Facebook reject certain names as false or even change them to more Anglicized versions, as reported by some users in the incident, they are framing the way those users are able to present themselves online. Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes, for example, had his name changed to “Lance Brown.” As a result, his identity, Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes had his name changed to “Lance Brown,” effectively losing some of his Native American identity in the reduction of his name. This transgression affects his interaction with friends or other users, who, after chatting with “Lance Brown” on Facebook, may also begin to see Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes as someone without a Native American identity.
Facebook presents many features, such as staying in contact with friends who do not live within close proximity. Facebook allows people to engage with friends who do not live within close proximity, the rest of community and even the world. Though connections can now easily be maintained between people who have access to computers, there needs to be a counteraction to create a more individualized experience.
From a technological viewpoint, it is incredibly difficult to create a system that accounts for every single trait, characteristic and idiosyncrasy of the more than seven billion people on our planet. Facebook’s policy on gender identity from 2014 provides a glimpse into this. When signing up for the first time, users were given 50 different options to put as their gender, from the traditional “male” and “female” to other options such as “transgender,” “cisgender” and “intersex.” The fact that there are so many options for just one aspect of a person’s identity shows how complex people really are. Because of this variation in individual personality and traits, one simply cannot expect social media companies to cater to all of our specific identities.
Ultimately, incidents like these are a reminder that social media companies cannot cater to all of their users’ needs, and that one should exercise some caution when relying on social media to interact with other people. Imperfect representations of users, while seemingly harmless at first, can change the way people see each other and themselves.

The amount of camaraderie you can build with people within a little over two weeks is surprisingly great, especially when considering that your group was initially divided by cultural barriers and backgrounds. My two weeks at Keio University were a special time, as demonstrated by the farewells that flowed between the Japanese students and the “foreign” students on the evening of our last official day together. The goodbyes might have been difficult, but at the same time, we were able to celebrate the times we enjoyed together with one last group dinner.
The semester at Yonsei University in Seoul will be an entirely different experience than the one I had in Tokyo. The transition is one from spending whole days with a small group of people to joining a pool of several hundred people with nationalities from all over the world. On any given elevator ride up to my dorm room, I can expect to hear students talking in a language other than English.
One of the things I miss the most in the transition between Japan and Korea are the small details embedded into Japanese society. My time in Tokyo made me realize that the Japanese appreciate small creature comforts and put thought and effort into integrating small but enjoyable details into their lives. Such Japanese creature comforts include baskets provided at restaurants to put your belongings into so they don’t have to get dirty on the floor or occupy an extra chair, as well as coat hangers on the walls of restaurants (which can even be found in the humblest of vending machine eateries). These two examples are what came to mind tonight as I dined out with friends in Itaewon, Seoul.
While this isn’t my first time in Seoul, coming into this city straight from Tokyo has lent a new twist to my perspective on it. My first impression of Tokyo was that it reminded me of Seoul but now that I’m in Seoul, I’m seeing that the two cities are vastly different, despite their influences on each other. During my four months in Korea, I’ll be able to get a better feel for Korean culture and the language but I’m also looking forward traveling around the peninsula during my free time.
Just yesterday, I was out in Myeoung-dong, a popular destination within Seoul among tourists, where my friends and I happened to take typical touristy pictures in front of the Myeoung-dong cathedral with a young Korean couple. It’s been an eventful start.

Located off of Hoover between 23rd and 24th St and packed tightly between other restaurants and cafes lies a hot spot for authentic, Italian cuisine. Being in walking distance (or a cheap Uber­able trip) from campus, Bacaro L.A. welcomes guests with a refined menu and a quaint, hip environment. The restaurant opened in 2008 and from a visit on a Saturday night, Bacaro seems to be pleasing customers with its polished and sophisticated dishes.
Bacaro serves its guests in the style of “cicchetti,” or Italian small plates. Each plate costs $8, or one can order three plates for $21. For entrees, the menu is broken up into cold, hot and grilled pizza categories. Seasonal items may have a price hike on them, but the desserts and cheese/salumi plates range from $5 to $6.
When I say the plates are small, I mean that they are, in fact, small. They are more the size of appetizers when compared to other restaurants that serve you American­sized (oversized most often) portions. If you haven’t eaten all day and were planning to fill up on the missed calories over dinner, don’t pick Bacaro unless you’re willing to dish out the extra cash. Pick up a burger beforehand.
Despite surprise over the portion size, my friend and I split three plates. The beautifully crafted platters served on our little wooden table outdoors were simply exquisite masterpieces.
We, of course, had to start out with the Bruschetta with roasted garlic, balsamic and basil walnut pesto, a classic “cold” Italian appetizer.
The presentation and aroma had me sold before I even picked up a piece of the crisp bread topped with colorful cherry tomatoes and bronzed garlic. I give the bruschetta a 10/10, quite possibly just for the fact that I was eating chunks of garlic without even knowing it. The cloves of garlic were roasted brown, their taste tender and completely transformed.
For the “hot” dishes, my dinner date friend picked the Mac and Cheese. A word of warning, my fellow classmates: this was no ordinary Easy Mac we’re talking about. The five­-cheese fondue and truffle oil smothered noodles came served in a little dish with crispy panko and green onions on top delicately tying the dish together. This pasta dish was very unlike those I have tried before, and I’ve had my fair share of pastas and varieties of mac and cheeses. Bacaro definitely takes on a different taste, but they do so well­. The pasta was both light and indulgently creamy, and the top had a contrasting crispness to it.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
The final plate was probably the most filling (or perhaps my friend and I had been already feeling full from the delicious bruschetta and pasta.)
My roommates and I have a panini press in our kitchen. After visiting Bacaro, I feel almost ashamed at my pathetic attempt of using soft whole wheat bread to try and recreate a classic Italian panini.
Bacaro’s “hot” menu served us chicken breast and fire-roasted bell peppers melted between mozzarella and slices of softly crisped bread with a fantastic side of Cornichon shallot aioli.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
My friend said she was already full and didn’t want any of the panini, but after convincing her to take a bite, her eyes lit up. Yeah, it was good, to say the least.
I’m a big fan of aioli and sauces/dips that give off the right balance of creaminess, softness and that still have a little sharpness to them in flavor. Bacaro’s aioli is definitely a crowd pleaser.
Bacaro is small all around when it comes to plate size and location, but flavor, service, the dining experience and hospitality are anything but small. You will find the place packed on weekend nights with USC students crammed into the benches and small tables against tall chalkboards talking and laughing over wine, or you can spot a few friends catching up over Italian sodas and coke served in glass bottles outside. (Being underage, I was unable to consume and review Bacaro’s selection of alcoholic beverages, but from the looks of the restaurant and 21+ students enjoying themselves, Bacaro also appears to succeed in this area.)

Let’s face it — Leavey library is not anyone’s favorite place on campus. But as much as we all roll our eyes at the questionable interior color scheme and resent the fact that we have to pay for printing, most students, if pressed, would likely admit that Leavey has come through for them in one way or another throughout their years at USC. Spending any extended period of time inside means seeing the same sorts of people over and over. Here are the five people you will likely meet in your 8+ hour-long visits during midterm season.

We have all seen (and felt sorry for) this kid. He sits in his cubicle in a state of panic with seven weeks worth of messy class notes spread out around him. He flips frantically through his textbook, trying to figure out a way to absorb an extensive amount of information before the exam tomorrow. Seeing this kid makes us sad, but it also secretly makes us feel better about ourselves. No matter how unprepared we feel for our own midterms, at least we know we’re better off than he is. Good thing Leavey is open all night!

She walks from floor to floor in awe, trying to figure out how there are possibly so many people there. She doesn’t know how many floors there are or that there is a group study room downstairs and asks questions like, “Wait, but where are the actual books?” You hear her looking around and whispering, “Wow, this is so cool!” You chuckle, realizing she has clearly never spent an entire night cramming in a cubicle.

 
We see them and wonder why they’re still there. We struggle to understand why they’re electing to spend time in Leavey if they aren’t going to study. She’s browsing the Lululemon website for a new pair of leggings. He’s playing Minecraft. Go home, we silently urge them. Just go home.

Of course the upstairs areas are designated quiet zones for studying, but the basement level outside area and the group study room both permit talking. Some kids choose to use these spaces to host their socializing. On occasion, you can spot people sitting on the couches outside of the group study room eating snacks from TroGro and casually chatting. As in #3, he same question arises: If you’re not studying, why are you here?

This kid usually visits late at night or early in the morning before class starts. He walks in, puts a couple dollars on his USCard prints out whatever paper is due or whichever lab he needs to prepare for. And then he gets out of there. As quickly as he possibly can.
