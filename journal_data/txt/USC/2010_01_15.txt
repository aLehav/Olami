Jeff Bridges’ nearly forty-year acting career in Hollywood has earned him four Academy Award nominations, but it is his latest film, Crazy Heart, that could easily become the actor’s first win. With such an impressive career, however, Bridges is more often associated with The Big Lebowski and his iconic portrayal of The Dude.

Since its 1998 release, The Big Lebowski has become more than just a cult-classic; it has inspired its own themed festivals and its main character has spawned offbeat, pseudo-religious groups who live their lives according to The Dude’s philosophies.
The Dude — who is a fiend for bowling, Creedence Clearwater Revival, marijuana and white Russians — has become so infamous that he has eclipsed a great deal of Bridges’ other performances to the point where the character is more well-known than the actor who portrays him.
Crazy Heart is likely to change all of that.
In his latest film, Bridges portrays Bad Blake, a country singer with a drinking problem, four ex-wives and a reputation as an old man.  Blake only plays bowling alleys, small reception halls and bars while his one-time pupil rises to stardom in the world of contemporary country music that Blake so bitterly defies.
Bad Blake is a good ol’ boy, like Hank Williams, Townes Van Zandt or Waylon Jennings, who writes songs about life and how it has devastated and shaped him. Once famous himself, years of hard drinking and the overall evolution of country music — from rebel musicians to pre-Madonna superstars — has left Blake haunting bars because he does not belong anywhere else.
The character has a weariness about him that personifies an entire era of country music. Blake’s life is, in fact, an old country song in itself, filled with desolation and sorrow where drowning in alcohol is the only solution.
Propelling himself along with the blatant cowboy lifestyle — which so many real musicians personally called their own — Blake does so much more than showcase a theme or a style. Blake is literally the mythology that is country western music.
It is the despondency that surrounds Blake that makes him so intriguing. At no point in his career has Bridges ever been a stranger to this weariness, and that makes the role of Blake even more suitable for him.
Since the actor’s 1971 Academy Award-nominated performance for his first film, The Last Picture Show, Bridges has shown an ambition that can rarely be matched by most American actors, and the brilliant thing about Bridges’ abilities comes from the fact that he is able to relay anguish or harsh content with such ease. Every performance resonates as nothing less than natural.
Whether it is Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Starman, Tucker: The Man and His Dream, The Fisher King, The Contender or even The Big Lebowski, each of his characters are immensely complicated but are presented to the audience in the form of a relatable friend they always knew they had.
Everyone loves The Dude — it is very hard not to — but this affection for what modern society would consider a deadbeat is a result of Bridges’ charm more so than the fictional character’s attitude. The mythology of The Dude, in fact, belongs to Bridges, for whom the Coen brothers specifically wrote the part.
The ambition and charm that Bridges has become so well known for is what made The Dude so unique, an attitude which he has embodied since his first film and now brings to Crazy Heart.
Jeff Bridges has learned to transform himself into his characters by simply being himself. More so than any of his previous characters, Bridges’ conception of Bad Blake most clearly showcases this ability and distinguishes him from other actors. He uses his charm to portray the weary kind of man that he certainly is not, and it takes nearly a forty-year career in Hollywood to allow an actor the ability to dramatize himself as someone so distantly unlike himself.
The Dude, as wonderful as he is, does not have the power behind him that Bad Blake does. Blake resonates the perfection Bridges has been developing over his entire career and how Jeff Bridges’ charm will never go to waste, even on a character who has wasted away almost all of his redeeming qualities.
Bridges has always seemed to be in his prime, and Crazy Heart further reiterates this as Bridges both sings and acts in the film. And each time he belts out one of Blake’s withstanding classics — especially “The Weary Kind” — you can tell Jeff Bridges still has a long career ahead of him.

It so happens that our vague, pop-cultural notion of what Riverdance is — Irish step dancing to overproduced Celtic music by high-kicking men and women in tights — is basically right.
Step up · Riverdance, advertised as an international phenomenon, presents traditional Irish step dancing alongside Russian ballet and flamenco. The show is in its final run. - Photos courtesy of Broadway L.A. 
And it’s fantastic.
Despite its relentless showiness and schmaltz, Riverdance is a soul-expanding experience that truly must be seen to be believed.
First performed in 1994, Riverdance has since become, to paraphrase its billboard advertisements, an international phenomenon, bringing its version of Irish culture to millions of people the world over. As part of the North American touring company’s farewell tour, Riverdance has returned to the Pantages Theatre for a brisk two-week engagement, ending Jan. 24.
There is an effort to structure the show so as to tell some sort of cultural story. Suffice it to say, that effort — mainly a series of pre-taped, faux-poetic narrations — fails miserably, but we couldn’t care less. This is pure celebration: two-plus hours of Irish music, dance and song that fly by effortlessly.
Although we leave with no new knowledge of Celtic mythology or Irish history and a feeling of being slightly talentless, we are nonetheless inspired, radiant and overjoyed by the experience.
The show’s two acts are separated by a 15-minute intermission. The first act is probably more satisfying than the second, which — except for a crowd-pleasing dance-off and some Russian ballet — is weighed down by comparatively staid numbers.
The best part of the show is “Firedance,” a flamenco solo by the beautiful Rocio Montoya. Bill Whelan’s music, which sometimes overpowers other performers, is expertly tamed by Montoya. She dances as though she were the instrument, each flick of her wrist the pluck of a fiddle’s string.
Lest we forget that the music is not coming from her but from other people onstage, the next number, “Slip into Spring – The Harvest,” features the phenomenal five-man Riverdance band, led by a plucky, charismatic Pat Mangan on the fiddle, who has probably spent much of his young life fighting off elderly women trying desperately to get their hands on his eminently squeezable cheeks. His technique is flawless, as is that of his fellow players.
It is the two principals (Marty Dowds and Melissa Convery), however, who carry the show. Thankfully, there is real chemistry between these world-class dancers and the unison sequences are properly epic. Convery has a carefree lightness to her movement, especially in her soft-shoe work, and an enchanting smile, which is complemented nicely by Dowds’ rigorous technique and straight-faced masculinity.
Other notables include baritone soloist Michael Samuels, whose perfectly controlled voice is so captivating we forget that the lyrics to these songs are unbearably mushy. His “Heal Their Hearts – Freedom” is one of the high points of the second act, thanks also to the timing of Rupert Murray’s mostly fluid lighting.
The dance-off is the other high point. Dowds and friends take on two street tappers (the nearly show-stealing Jason E. Bernard and Kelly Isaac) in a memorable battle that has the crowd cheering wildly. They continually have to exceed expectations, which becomes the basic theme of the night.
Most of the numbers either succeed or fail by comparison. After a point, we think we have seen this already, and it is up to the performers to surprise. Sometimes, as in the Russian ballet sequence, they do. Other times, as in Montoya’s second solo, “Andalucia,” which pales in comparison to her first, they don’t.
This is perhaps why the finale falls slightly flat as well. After a time, it turns into a greatest hits of the night, which is fun but obviously not fresh. Still, it rounds out the show.
Riverdance is nothing without the signature clickety-clack of the hard-shoe routines on the stage floor. Thankfully, the sound in the Pantages is better than ever. Michael O’Gorman’s sound design perhaps slightly over amplifies the band, but there is a fullness and crispness to the sound not heard in that hallowed chamber for some time. With one noticeable exception, the dancers were nearly perfectly synchronized in every number, and it paid off with the sound.
The backdrops are the only truly outdated part of the show. Old looking and muted, they do little to accent the performances. If they ever update Riverdance, they should start there.
Riverdance is a show everyone can and should see. When it ends, you leap to your feet — as much for yourself as for the performers onstage — and you find there is a little Irish jig in your step.

With National Influenza Vaccination Week drawing to a close today, officials continue to warn college-aged students to get vaccinated, despite a national drop in H1N1 cases in December.
Although the number of states reporting widespread flu activity dropped from seven to four during the last week of December, students who are not vaccinated against the H1N1 virus — commonly known as swine flu — are still at risk to contract the virus, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
“People have the perception that we’ve kind of gone through this, but what we do know is that this virus will stay around in some form for multiple years,” said Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, medical director for the LACDPH.
Daily Trojan | Mike Lee
A drop in flu activity is most likely because of the population’s increasing immunity. This immunity can come from a vaccine or from previously contracting the virus.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said the health center has also noticed a decline in H1N1 cases, reflecting the national trend.
“We have seen very little H1N1 or presumed H1N1 in the past month,” Neinstein wrote in an e-mail.
The number of H1N1 cases reported to the California Department of Public Health was 72 cases between Dec. 20 and Dec. 26, a drop from the 209 cases reported the previous week. This decrease marks the passing of the “second wave” of the H1N1 influenza, officials say.
Though the second wave seems to be a thing of the past, health officials still warn about the possibility of another wave in the future.
“Past pandemics have had multiple waves, including a third wave,” said Matthew Reynolds, spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control. “But there’s no way to know if we’re going to have one now.”
Neinstein said the health center still recommends that students even though the virus seems to have dropped off for now.
“It is very possible, per health department and CDC, that there will be a third peak that occurs somewhere between January and March,” Neinstein said.
Lizz Clark, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering who contracted the H1N1 virus last fall, said she believes students should still be concerned about another outbreak.
“College students should definitely be more aware of the flu than non-college students … [It] can affect so many more people in such a short amount of time,” Clark said.

The Undergraduate Student Government is suggesting a $1 increase to the student programming fee to make up for miscommunication between treasurers and also to keep up with rising costs. If approved, the student programming fee will total $56.50 per semester, and USG will add an additional $30,000 to its budget.
USG has surveyed student interest and determined that an increase to the programming fee, which students pay every semester, will help it better serve students, President Holden Slusher said. The fee increase must be approved by Student Affairs and the Board of Trustees before it is enacted.
USG found itself shortchanged this year because of miscommunication that arose the last time they proposed a fee increase in 2008.
The proposed 50 cent increase was approved by Student Affairs, and, as USG budgeted for the 2008-2009 school year, they included the extra 50 cents. The trustees vetoed the budget, however, and the veto was not communicated properly to USG. USG was surprised to learn they would not have the $15,000 extra they had anticipated, and, because of the communication issue, Student Affairs chose to compensate USG.
But in 2009, the outgoing treasurer did not adequately communicate the situation to current treasurer Ashwin Appiah. USG drew up their budget and included the extra $15,000 that Student Affairs had provided to compensate for the previous year’s error, only to find out that the $15,000 payment was a one-time compensation.
To avoid this kind of mistake in the future, Slusher told Appiah to be cautious.
“This year, we lost $15,000 but, because of mandatory university policies, we had to give all of our staff … a 3 percent pay raise, so it’s like ‘great, that money comes out of programming or somewhere else,’” Slusher said. “We’d have to get really creative and I think it’s something we’ve already done. And sometimes it’s really hard.”
With the $1 increase, USG hopes to offset costs and to continue offering the quality of programs they do now.
USG was not particularly hindered by the missing $15,000 this year, Slusher said, because supplemental funding accrued when more students enrolled than expected, thus allowing USG to collect more programming fees.
Still, the situation was not ideal.
“We had to adjust to operate like normal,” Slusher said.
A survey sent out in November asked students if they would be willing to increase the programming fee, and one question asked if they would be willing to pay more for “bigger and better talent,” according to Appiah.
“The overwhelming response was ‘yes, we would like an increase,’” Appiah said. “I saw that the increase was more than a dollar, so a lot of people would want an increase in the student programming fee for bigger and better events.”
Helena Wichova, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said she agrees an increase would be good if used in the right ways.
“I’m not really sure where USG is putting their money,” Wichova said. “Although I’m sure I’m benefiting from some of the programs that it funds.”
Sean Perry, a junior majoring in economics and mathematics, also said he agrees that an increase in the programming fee would be beneficial.
“I think it’s a good idea if they have a lot of money to do a lot of good things,” Perry said. “I know other schools have to pay more because the students get bigger name artists to perform. USC seems like it’s a little bit below the other schools.”

No way!!!! I’m going to rally a sit-in like they did in Westwood. This is unfair!!!!!
Everything should be provided by the government, society owes it to us!!!
Long live Tim Fehr.
the programming is already mediocre, at best. once we start getting decent performers again (the bravery, lupe fiasco, etc…) and none of that ok go / jamie kennedy b.s… then we’ll talk about a justifiable increase. usg should seriously have a way to measure how well their events have gone. quite honestly, the past year and half in programming has been pretty lame, especially when compared to our neighboring schools.

Striving to offer a better variety of food — specifically, international cuisine — USC Hospitality has opened two new restaurants to Café 84.
Choices · Students purchase a meal at Café 84’s newest addition, Wasabi Sushi. Daphne’s Greek Café has also been added to the venue’s roster. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
Hospitality has added Daphne’s Greek Café and Wasabi Sushi, getting rid of The Grill to make space.
Director of Hospitality Kristian Klinger said the idea was conceived in November last year, and officials decided to do the work over winter break to avoid coinciding with the construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, which will be in its final stages this summer.
“We will be pretty busy next summer with the campus center so we wouldn’t have as [many] resources available,” Klinger said. “This was the perfect time.”
Klinger said Wasabi Sushi was chosen because Hospitality received feedback from students that they wanted sushi options beyond the packaged, refrigerated sushi available around campus.
Hospitality is also aiming to turn Café 84 into a hub of international food, Klinger said, and he hopes the changes to the venue reflect this goal.
“It’s going to be more of an international facility; it’s very diverse and we want to continue to offer that,” Klinger said.
Café 84 was chosen for a face-lift because with The Lot closing at the end of the school year it was the only restaurant area that hosts multiple food vendors, Klinger said.
Aside from the two new eateries, Café 84’s look has changed slightly, incorporating new posters and menus. The restaurant has also added cereal and changed its pasta recipe.
Takako Lee, a senior majoring in communication, said she expects more people will start going to Café 84 with the new additions.
“I love sushi, so I’m excited there’s a new place to get it from,” Lee said.
Stephanie Shum, a junior majoring in business administration, said she is happy USC Hospitality is adding new options for students.
“It’s good because some of the things they had here they have at The Lot, so it was kind of redundant,” Shum said. “Restaurant variety allows students to eat at different spots on campus.”
Jonathan Igner, a senior majoring in business administration, said he believes these additions could have more people staying on campus to eat.
“It’s cool to have new options,” he said. “I’ve been here for four years, and you get tired of the same thing and you have to go off campus to get something different.”
About as authentic as Taco Bell is to Mexican food, yum yum!

Vampire Weekend is the band that music snobs with selective tastes and struggling musicians collecting unemployment love to hate. And if you thought the conceptual art-school scene that turned New York into a post-punk revival circa 2000 were pretentious, Vampire Weekend is the pastel-loving, boat shoe-wearing group of Ivy League-bred musicians who have taken that word, flipped it upside down and popped its collar.
But these are the boys who don’t give “a f—” about an Oxford comma, and, instead of giving into the backlash from its 2008 self-titled debut, Vampire Weekend follows it with an album full of the same vigor and intensity. Although it’s easy to hate what the band stands for, Contra ­­— the prepsters’ latest studio album — is really, really difficult to dislike.
Sunny, spacious and intoxicatingly melodic, Contra is a fuller, more intricate and hook-heavy record than the band’s debut. Lyrically, guitarist and lead vocalist Ezra Koenig and his cronies have matured, though that’s not to say they weren’t articulate or eloquent enough from the start. The pre-Contra Vampire Weekend was teeming with subtle critiques on hipster culture with references to buying apartments in Washington Heights (a section of Manhattan) and love interests adorned in keffiyahs.
But the arrival of their sophomore effort also represents a resurgence of ethnic world music into the predominantly white-washed indie genre, a newfound burst of flavor that has been seen locally in Los Angeles in the form of the multilingual, afro-pop inspired Fool’s Gold.
Perhaps most significantly, Vampire Weekend adds much needed, and appreciated, touches of sun to the often dreary Northeastern skies and flashes of not-so-pastel color to the muted grays and browns of the Manhattan skyline. From a 21st century New Yorker’s perspective, it’s the type of album that will get you through the brisk and bleak winter days.
Contra begins with a sunrise and a warm morning breeze as you sip horchata on a veranda overlooking a palm tree-studded beach. As the band’s first single, “Horchata,” — which was released as a free download on the band’s website last October —with its airy vocals and fluid construction, ushers the listener into Contra and, ultimately, Vampire Weekend’s idealistic world.
Following “Horchata” is the sugary, hook-driven “White Sky” and the toe-tapping “Holiday.” Just as you’ve warmed up, Vampire Weekend slows the pacing with “Taxi Cab,” the album’s brightest spot that conjures the sights and sounds of Manhattan with its intricate instrumentation that never clashes but is instead sweetly cohesive — just like the city.
“Taxi Cab” is only a mellow interlude, however, as Contra continues on its cloudless day with the racing “Cousins” and fizzling “Giving Up the Gun.”
Toward the album’s end, “Diplomat’s Son,” which dabbles in the rhythms of reggae, acts as the post-dinner walk around the block — upbeat but languid, it wanders in circles with no sense of urgency or purpose.
And as the sunlight begins to fade, so does Contra with its hazy closer, “I Think Ur A Contra.” An offbeat lullaby, Koenig’s voice is strained and worn yet brimming with emotion as he nearly whispers But I just wanted you. The song abruptly ends after several counts of softly rattling maracas, which is a bit premature for a tune that feels like it still has verses left. The result is an album that feels rushed rather than complete.
It might be early to call, but Contra will most likely be 2010’s Merriweather Post Pavilion — the Animal Collective album that topped nearly every rock music magazine’s best-of list — well thought-out and neatly put together but hardly groundbreaking in sound or substance.
The fault of Vampire Weekend lies within the band’s influences, which is said to be 1970s new wave like Talking Heads and legendary punk rock like The Clash.
Yes, musically, punk is classified by stripped-bare instrumentation and hard, fast-paced songs, which Vampire Weekend embodies in its own tropical way. But as it was born from a rebellion against the mainstream rock music of the time, punk is also typified by attitude, a trait that has become synonymous with the genre. It is a quality that Vampire Weekend lacks and proves detrimental when those expecting more edge or ambition from a band that cites Joe Strummer as an influence fails to deliver outside its own Upper West Side box.
But these are the boys who care as much about taking a stance as they do about an Oxford comma. Contra plays it safe, and Vampire Weekend wouldn’t have it any other way.

While some are still opting for steaming lattes over frappuccinos, Laura Veirs’ newest album, July Flame, is an ode to summer, and it beautifully paints a picture of the season’s peaceful warmth and exciting freedom.
July Flame is Laura Veirs’ seventh album and her first in nearly three years. Veirs, a hidden gem among many folk aficionados, has stood out for years for her unique voice and poetic writing. Her newest CD is an interesting display of these talents, although it is closer to the idle sketches of an artist than a masterwork. These musical sketches, however, sometimes outshine the better-known works with both unconscious talent and ingenuity.
Folk-y indie music often falls into self-parody. For every Decemberists and Regina Spektor releasing an album, there is also a guy plucking at his guitar and singing sleepily about butterflies and Babylon. But then there are artists like Laura Veirs, who take the simplicity of guitar and vocals and create beautifully simple songs.
A July flame is a kind of peach that grows in the summer and July Flame takes many of summer’s greatest peach-flavored pleasures — sweet peach melba and refreshing peach ice cream — and captures them in song.
Summer has many tones, however, and so does Veirs’ album. “Sun is King” creates a languorous mood akin to one swaying in a hammock and idly people-watching. Meanwhile, “Life is Good” is the perfect aural picture of summer dances in a field. “Where Are You Driving?” takes the musical tone of those times as a kid when the zoo or grandpa’s farm seemed like the perfect afternoon adventure.  A particularly strong track is “Summer is the Champion,” a grin-worthy song in its jaunty carelessness.
The title song is musically thicker than some of the others, but is carried swiftly by Veirs’ assertive vocals. All of the songs have some degree of dreaminess, like a summer haze that never burns off.
The overlying theme, however, isn’t only the season but also romance, which explains “Little Deschutes,” a contrast to all the sunny numbers. The song takes Veirs on a sadder turn, with lonesome lyrics and a melancholy tone. Yet it fits the summer theme perfectly — summer may be the time for romantic adventure, but it has also been the site of plenty of breakups.
Through all of these pleasant tracks, Laura Veirs is like a woodland elf, flitting and gliding through each number, her voice an ethereal growl. Her pipes make July Flame pleasing to the ears and her voice has just enough of an edge to avoid the sappiness that could easily drip into a CD that is essentially a collection of summer love songs.
July Flame’s themes make it easy to slide into maudlin whimsy, but, thankfully, it doesn’t. The lyrics and orchestrations manage to capture an honest naïveté that makes it feel like a young summer instead of the pretentious idealizations of one. Because of this, July Flame is genuinely pleasant, refreshing to listen to and a more than worthy companion on car trips.
For virtually all the songs, the musical and vocal accompaniment to Veirs’ singing and guitar work is pared down to a minimum. This is Veirs sitting under a tree enjoying the inspiration of a warm breeze, and she is easily a strong enough singer to perform the songs without backup.
In fact, the songs that do have vocal accompaniment, often provided by My Morning Jacket’s Jim James, distract from the sweet simplicity of the CD. When the musical accompaniment becomes more prominent, it feels almost washed out. The richness of July Flame comes when Veirs is front and center, with accompaniment adding texture and depth in the background.
While July Flame is a strong album, it is unlikely to be remembered as a classic of the genre. It is pleasant — perfect to listen to while doing the dishes or procrastinating on homework by surfing the web — but it does not grab you by the ears and make your hands stop scrubbing or your fingers stop typing. One might hum the songs, but they will not likely be seared into one’s memory.
Though July Flame’s defiance of indie schmaltziness lies in its charming innocence, it keeps the intensity light enough to never pierce deep. Sure, summers are chummier with ice cream and afternoon naps but haven’t some summers changed people’s lives?
Yet a pleasantly satisfying CD is far better than a spectacular failure. Laura Veirs has created a beautiful summer soundtrack. This winter, with news networks covering the Haitian earthquake and airport security taking twice as long, the warm breath of summer is a comforting sound.

With pressure from the university, the Interfraternity Council advised chapters to cancel Welcome Back Nights events scheduled for Thursday night.
In a letter to the IFC executive board, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development recommended fraternities rethink their plans to hold social events on Thursday.
“It has come to the attention of The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development that events during the period called ‘Welcome Back Nights’ have created an alarming concern for safety in the Greek and university community,” the letter stated. “At the highest request of the Department of Public Safety and with consultation with Senior Administration, it is the expectation that any and all events occurring tonight on Thursday, January 14, 2010 be cancelled.”
Though the letter did not order events be cancelled, Eric Ronan, president of IFC, said he strongly suggested the houses follow the university’s recommendation.
“I advised them, because of the advice of DPS and the advice of the university, that they should follow the advice of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life,” Ronan said. “But it’s at their discretion.”
Ronan said the recommendation from the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development was prompted mainly by the large number of non-USC students who attempted to attend the Welcome Back Nights events on Wednesday.
“Our fraternity policy is that only USC students are allowed to come to the events, and, unfortunately, there were a lot of non-USC students trying to get in, and, when they weren’t allowed, that was what caused a lot of the congestion,” Ronan said.
Thursday’s DPS incident log noted that DPS officers responded to several instances of large groups of people gathered outside of fraternity houses.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said there were more than 2,000 people on The Row Wednesday night. Carlisle also noted that parties on weeknights are against university policy.
SCampus states “formally organized parties and dances may be scheduled only between 3 p.m. on Friday through 5 p.m. on Sunday.” Despite this policy, Carlisle said fraternities can sometimes still host social events on weeknights.
“Over the past couple of years there have been gentlemen’s agreements that if they’re inside the house and there’s nobody out drinking and we can’t hear the music outside, we might have an agreement that that’s not a party. But occasionally people become more lax and they turn into parties, like last night when there were more than 2,000 people.”
Ronan said he is not sure how non-USC students caught wind of the Welcome Back Nights events.
Carlisle said six parties were shut down by DPS Wednesday. He noted, however, that all the fraternities were cooperative.
DPS Lieutenant Jim Fairrington said officers did not inform the houses there would be additional repercussions for parties held Thursday, as such a policy was not in place.
The letter from the university did say, however, that if DPS exhausted its resources Thursday night, “LAPD will be forced to respond.”
Ronan noted that there were no alcohol-related issues Wednesday night.
“The only real issue was the volume of people,” he said.
Carlisle echoed this sentiment.
“There were large groupings at different houses on The Row, but there was nothing outrageous or out of control at these houses,” he said.
Very soon they will say no more parties at the row because too many non-usc students show up.
I agree that it becomes less safer when strangers crash the party, but it is part of the USC student experience.
It makes students street-smart and they graduate with a well rounded experience.
Check your facts before you speak.
Eric Ronan is an idiot.  He changed the rules for Welcome Back Nights and predictably it resulted in chaos.

No. 13 USC men’s swimming will travel to Dallas and compete at the SMU Classic on Friday and Saturday. Eight of USC’s finest will be hoping to make a splash as they go up against five of the nation’s top teams, such as No. 6 Florida and  No. 7 Michigan.
“This is a chance to test where we’re at,” coach Dave Salo said.
Experienced youth · Freshman Clement Lefert is among the eight specialist swimmers the Trojans send to Dallas for the SMU Invite. Lefert, a French Olympian, will swim in the freestyle and butterfly events. - Sunhil Murali | Daily Trojan 
The men chosen to represent the Trojans are seniors Zoltan Povazsay and co-captain James Martin, juniors Dillon Connonlly and Richard Charlesworth, sophomores Jeff Daniels and co-captain Pat White, and freshmen Alex Lendrum and Clement Lefert.
Salo says the event to watch for the Trojans will be the 800-yard free relay, especially with the addition of Charlesworth — the team’s newest Olympic asset from Great Britain.
The men will be looking to improve on last year’s performance at SMU, and Salo feels confident in the team’s progress.
“I think we’re more balanced than last year and a lot more competitive,” Salo said.
The handpicked team specializes across a variety of strokes and distances, giving the Trojans a firm grip on the majority of the events they will be swimming. Daniels will be USC’s loan sprinter for the meet, with the absence of junior teammate Emmett Walling. Among the specialists, Charlesworth will be tackling the distance events while Povazsay and White take on the middle distance field.
Despite having their preferred events, they are each able to swim a combination of distances and strokes and that will be the team’s X-factor at SMU.
“Michigan and Florida will be tough to beat,” Salo said. “But I predict we can be third.”
USC’s divers will be competing at the UCLA Diving Invitational on Friday and Saturday and, therefore, will not be traveling to SMU.
Meanwhile, the rest of the men’s and women’s USC swimming and diving team will be competing at the California Grand Prix in Long Beach, Calif. This event is instead of the USC vs. Washington duel meet that will no longer take after Washington’s swimming program being cut last year.
The Trojans will have the opportunity to wear fast skins and get back into racing mode after a long winter training period. It will also give them a chance to prepare for their fast-approaching Stanford and California duel meets, which are always highly competitive.
“The event in Long Beach is not duel meet format, which means there is a little less focus on the team and a little more on the individual,” Salo said.

Tomorrow night when the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (3-1, 1-0) travels to the Bren Center to face No. 3 UC Irvine (4-1, 1-0) in a rematch of last year’s NCAA final, there will be a lot more at stake than a chance at revenge.
This year’s Trojan team, full of seasoned veterans and battle-tested leaders, understands that an early-season matchup against the Anteaters represents an opportunity to make a lasting statement as they go forward through conference play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
“The last two seasons UCI ended our season, so we don’t care for the Anteaters too much,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said. “If there is going be a statement game this season this is going to be it, and we will make a statement.”
Though last year’s heartbreaking five-set loss to UCI in the national championship left the Trojans with a bitter taste in their mouths, they enter the 2010 season with the loss serving as a source of inspiration. As the team has its sights set squarely on the ultimate prize in collegiate sports, the match that got away last May has motivated the players to become a more disciplined and focused unit this year.
“I think that the main thing for us is having the mindset where we just play our game instead of trying to play better than we already are,” Bourne said. “We were given the No. 1 ranking in the country, [and] even though we believe that we deserve it, we all know that we have to prove that.”
For UCI, 2006 AVCA Coach of the Year John Speraw’s team comes into Friday’s match with the Trojans red-hot after losing opening night to No. 6 BYU. After their four-set loss to the Cougars, UCI closed the Elephant Bar Tournament with two convincing victories over No. 11 UCSD and No. 7 Long Beach State.
Leading the Irvine team in their quest to become the first repeat national champion in men’s volleyball since the 1996 UCLA Bruins achieved the feat are sophomore opposite Carson Clark — and senior outside hitter Cole Reinholm — who had a career-high 21 kills in the team’s win over UCSD earlier this month.
For the Trojans, this week has already created some early-season praise from around the conference, after the team Wednesday night dispatched crosstown rival UCLA in just four sets on the Bruins’ home floor (30-26, 29-31, 30-26, 30-28). Despite the big win over their main rivals, this year’s Trojans embrace the concept that in order to win a national championship, the team must not rest on its laurels at any point.
“Despite a big win against rival UCLA, we understand that we need to approach each game one at a time,” senior middle blocker Hunter Current said. “Every team, including UCI, wants to ruin our season and we’re looking to prove them wrong every time.”
While fourth-year coach Bill Ferguson feels confident about his team’s chances Friday night, he admits that in order to beat a team of UCI’s caliber, his team must improve from the service line.
“We haven’t been able to put teams under pressure with our service game,” Ferguson said. “It is something we need to continue to improve upon if we want any consistent success at a high level.”
So while notions of a statement game or a chance to seek revenge may initially surround tomorrow night’s huge 7 p.m. matchup, when the whistle blows, the Trojans will have only one thing in mind when they face the Anteaters: to win.
“This match is a good step for us,” Ferguson said. “Winning on the road in our league is very tough. Any time we can get a win, we will definitely cherish it.”

As the USC women’s basketball team prepares to host rival UCLA on Sunday, one statistic has the team’s attention.
The winner will take over sole possession of third place in the Pac-10 Conference.
Ready · Senior guard Heather Oliver anticipates a tough game. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“This is more than just a rivalry game,” sophomore guard Ashley Corral said. “Whoever wins this game moves ahead of the other [in the conference standings].”
That doesn’t mean the Women of Troy (9-6, 3-1) are discounting the importance of beating their crosstown rival. Even newcomers like first-year coach Michael Cooper are well aware of how heated the rivalry can be.
“We almost don’t need to win another game if we beat UCLA,” Cooper quipped. “It’s going to be a big game.”
Corral, a Washington native, said she learned what the rivalry truly meant once she stepped foot on campus.
“As soon as you get to USC you realize the rivalry,” Corral said. “I’ve never been a Bruins fans. I don’t ever plan on being one.”
Beating UCLA will be no easy task for the Women of Troy. UCLA (10-5, 3-1) took No. 2 Stanford to the wire last weekend before losing 65-61. By comparison, USC lost to the Cardinal earlier this season by 20 points.
“It’s going to be a tough game,” senior guard Heather Oliver said. “They came really close to Stanford last weekend.”
Cooper said one of his challenges over the past week has been keeping his team on an even keel.
“We don’t want to get too hyped up for [the game],” he said. “But we also don’t want to be too low.”
Another challenge for the Women of Troy will be the physicality of UCLA. Cooper said that the Bruins, while not a particularly tall team, have a lot of girth down low. Still, he expects his players to hold their own in the paint.
“We’ve been undersized against everyone and we’ve overcome that all season long,” he said.
One area where USC should have an advantage is at the end of the game. If the score is close late, count on the Women of Troy coming out on top. USC has won all three of its conference games this season by four points or less.
“We’re starting to realize what it takes to win games,” Oliver said. “We learned a lot from last year when we lost a lot of close games. Now we’re relaxed.”
The Women of Troy will need to bottle up some of that experience for what should be a tightly contested game.
Tip off is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.
