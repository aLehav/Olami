Everyone currently at USC was lucky enough to grow up during one of the greatest sporting periods in the history of our storied university. From 2002 until 2011-2012, USC enjoyed a period of success that is almost unmatched by any university in the country. I like to call this the golden era of Trojan athletics.
While USC won numerous NCAA championships during this era, the one aspect that made the past decade so extraordinary and unique was our continued dominance over our crosstown rivals, the UCLA Bruins. Nothing was better than watching the Trojans beat the Bruins year after year.
Though every discussion with a Bruin fan usually starts and ends with football, the Trojans’ dominance extended past the annual battle for the Victory Bell. The Trojans own the overall football record and were in the middle of winning 12 out of 13 matchups, capped off by an impressive 50-0 win that would become immortalized on one of my favorite shirts.
However, it was USC’s ability to compete with UCLA in sports the Bruins were known to dominate such as soccer, tennis and water polo that made this era so special.
The Trojans men’s water polo team won eight national championships, including six consecutively. The women’s soccer team defeated the Bruins in the NCAA tournament in 2007 en route to their first-ever national championship. UCLA, which dominated men’s tennis in the 1970s and 1980s, has watched USC win six out of seven championships.
Every UCLA pundit will point out UCLA’s basketball history, including back-to-back trips to the Final Four in the mid-2000s. Yes, UCLA was better than USC at basketball during this period. Yes, UCLA won multiple championships in the 1970s. However, it was USC standing tall toward the end of the decade, looking poised to take over basketball dominance in Los Angeles before the whole O.J. Mayo scandal.
So can anyone tell me what in the world happened? How could this dominance of a decade-plus years suddenly disappear in the span of two years?
The Trojan football team has been outplayed and outclassed by our bitter rivals for three years now. Our basketball team hasn’t won a game over UCLA in the past five tries. Our six-time defending national champion water polo team saw its championship run end at the hands of the Bruins, who defeated the Trojans 9-8 in the 2014 title game. To cap it off, UCLA won the baseball national championship, a sport in which USC used to dominate, in 2013.
There are a lot of reasons for this drop off, mostly stemming from the harsh NCAA penalties and sanctions the university has faced the past five years due to the Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo cases. Other factors include the fact that USC cannot offer full scholarships for sports like baseball, track, golf, etc. due to Title IX rules.
I want to make this clear, though -— losing happens. I don’t expect the Trojans to beat the Bruins every time, even though that would be ideal. What I expect is for the players who represent the cardinal and gold to give it their all, especially in a rival game.
This past Wednesday night, I attended the USC versus UCLA basketball game. The Galen Center was as full as I had ever seen it, student section filled and all. I was filled with hope that our young and upcoming basketball team could put a bandage over the bleeding.
Boy, was I wrong. After a tight first half, USC was blown out in the second half and ended up losing 83-66. It wasn’t the fact that we lost or even that we got blown out. It was the fact that our team played with such a lackluster effort.
What made coaches like Pete Carroll and John McKay and players like Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush so great was the fact that they hated to lose to UCLA. To them, UCLA was more than a game — it was a determining factor of their success. There’s no need to panic — yet. Second-year men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield has the Trojans headed in the right direction, landing two more ESPN Top 100 recruits to pair alongside freshman standout guard Jordan McLaughlin.
The football team finally had its scholarship sanctions lifted, leading to several ESPN 300 recruits committing to USC.
The Trojans are shaping up to have a lot of national spotlight on them in the coming year in almost every sport, though the real spotlight will be on whether the Trojans can get it done against the Bruins.

Very we’ll said. Within the last couple of years I’ve noticed this change within USC athletes. The drive, determination, and desire to win is just not there. When competing, if they fall behind, they accept defeat and the effort to comeback is gone, and if they have the lead, they get comfortable where they are, and stop trying to extend the lead. Being a Trojan should be an honor, they are the best of the best, that’s why they are there, now they need to start playing like it. A true Trojan cannot, and will not accept defeat, so let’s put the “Fight” back into FIGHT ON !! 
Recruiting student athletes/players who have a determjned desire to win, not just skate through the season and experienced coaches who can coach them up is key to success.

The 2014 season is now gone and 2015 is here and that means a fresh start for USC women’s water polo.
The last time this team played a game in the pool, they won third place in the NCAA Tournament over Cal after falling short to UCLA in the semifinals in a 3-5 defensive battle. Senior Monica Vavic, leading scorer and the seventh all-time leading scorer in USC history, believes that last season’s failure to win a championship boils down to one component in particular.
“I think at the end of the season we lost confidence,” Vavic said.
Though the Women of Troy last year started 20-0, the team began to struggle near the end of the season, dropping four of the last 10 games, finishing fifth in the MPSF Tournament and falling short of their mission to repeat as national champions. However, the 2015 team is a completely different team from last year.
The team lost players to graduation, including star goalie Flora Bolonyai, and key scorers such as Colleen O’Donnell, Kaleigh Gilchrist, Olivia Cummins, Kelly Mendoza and Madeline Rosenthal, among others.
Last year’s seniors accounted for approximately a third of the team’s total goals.
Nonetheless, as Vavic describes enthusiastically, this team has a lot of new talent to replace its graduates.
“This year, we bring in a lot of new talent,” Vavic said. “Because we graduated so many girls and brought in so many new ones there’s a totally different dynamic on the team. We’re really excited and have a lot more people involved. We are much more confident this year. We are much more prepared and we are really excited to look to attack on the outside where we were nervous to shoot last year.”
Vavic went on to describe the newcomers and the newfound chemistry she had developed with them.
“We have a great class of freshmen,” Vavic said. “I’m probably most excited about this freshmen class including Brianna Daboub as an attacker who is a great player. She plays the 1-2 side with me. She can also be a defender. She’s really athletic. She’s really competitive. I am excited to play with her. We work a lot together. We have Hayley McKelvey who’s from Canada who’s a really strong guard good shooter. Great to have another defender which keeps me out of having defending two meters. We also have Sydney Blubaugh who is another two-meter defender. She’s a really strong girl, great outside shooter.”
In addition, the Women of Troy bring in a new starting goalie named Victoria Chamorro. “We have a goalie who will be  our starting goalie from Brazil,” Monica said. “She’s really great, has great reflexes, has really good charisma, good passer, not afraid to push the ball forward out of the counterattack. We also have two transfer students who are rookies not freshmen. We have Brigitta Games who is going to be a really powerful two-meter player we really need because we graduated our major two-meter man last year. She’ll be coming in and bringing a lot of power. Really strong and competitive and a huge force in our offense.   She brings a lot of athleticism and is very fast. She’s also extremely competitive. She makes us much more dangerous in the counterattack and is a really good player to play with. We’ve brought in a lot of great characters which really made the team a lot more fun to train with and definitely improved the level of competition within training. I’m really excited to see how the season goes.”
Though the team is seemingly connecting well with the rookies in these early stages of the season, the veterans of the team like Vavic have to step up their game to take the team to the next level.
“My role is going to change a lot as a communicator and leader in the water because we had a really immature team last year,” Vavic said. “We graduated six seniors. This year we have a team of a lot more freshmen. So I think this year, being a much younger team, I need to communicate much more than last year.”
Nonetheless, Vavic is not a typical veteran. Not only is her father, Jovan, the head coach, but her brother, Nikola, was quite a great USC water polo player himself. Monica, in her senior season has to deal with the fact that her brother in his senior season become the all-time leading scorer in USC history. As Vavic describes, she comes from a household with very high standards but is keeping her focus on this season.
“My brother won four-straight national championships and I lost my freshman year so I killed the expectation my freshman year. I think it doesn’t add additional pressure,” Vavic said. “It’s definitely something my dad has said but I’m not really concerned with that.”
Despite her discipline, there is no doubt Vavic has her eyes on the prize and is aiming to finish her career with another NCAA championship.
“I think it’s everything you can ask for here as an athlete. Everyone wants to win a national championship but I think winning a national championship as a senior is probably one of the most special things you can achieve,” Vavic said. “First of all you give the freshman something, a ring, and set the tone, the standard. And for yourself, USC is one of the greatest places on Earth and you’re leaving this university on a win. You are not going to reflect back and think I wish I worked harder in practice or think what if I had done this different, trained harder or spent more time with teammates. You reflect back and remember a whole bunch of smiles and remember the greatest time on the greatest place on earth.”
In addition to the seniors, like Vavic, some of the talented younger players are making an effort to improve, such as Stephania Haralabidis, who was last year’s second leading scorer on the team after Monica.
“This year I have to be more of a leader also with the older girls because I’ve had a year of Jovan’s coaching and also I have to improve on my offense and defense,” Haralabidis said. I’m improving more on it and I am very motivated to win as I’ve been working hard, staying after practices shooting. I really, really want this. We have really great chemistry on this team and I really want this for all my teammates and also myself.”
Speaking of chemistry, Haralabidis shares a particularly special bond with one of her teammates — Ioanna Haralabidis, her twin sister.
“It’s a great thing to have my sister on the team and have her with me all my life through water polo on every single team,” Haralabidis said. “I know where she wants the ball. We’re really fast swimmers. We have a great chemistry between us that we help each other in the pool when we need it.”
This team of not only strong players, but also family bonds, fresh talent and seasoned veterans feels good about entering the 2015 season which officially begins Saturday, Jan. 17 when the Women of Troy will take on CSU Bakersfield at 4 p.m. and Cal Baptist at 6:20 p.m.

With arguably one of the all-time Trojan greats leading the team and plenty of depth around the rest of the court, the men’s volleyball team comes into the 2015 campaign confident and eager to qualify for the NCAA national championship tournament for the first time in three seasons.
The Trojans implemented the equivalent of a no-huddle offense quarterbacked by the best setter in the country in senior Micah Christenson. Christenson, the Honolulu native who sets for the U.S. National team when he is not wearing cardinal and gold, will anchor a new scheme.
Head coach Bill Ferguson spoke very highly of Christenson’s abilities on the court and leadership off it.
“He’s got the ability to be one of the best that’s ever played here if he continues to work with the same efficiency and tenacity he’s had since he’s been here,” Ferguson said. “He’s a very hard worker, he’s fantastic in the film room and he’s great in the weight room, pretty much all aspects.”
The new offense is based on attacking opponents with aggressive serves and quick sets to hitters. Ferguson said that instead of calling for high sets that give the offense time to get in position, the Trojans will instead try to catch opposing defenses off-guard by setting lower and attacking faster.
“The tempo of our offense is faster,” Ferguson said. “Our middles are getting up and hitting the quick sets faster, our Bic [back row quick] is a little bit faster and we’re teeing off from the service line.”
The Trojans return 12 players for the 2015 season who appeared in a match last year. The team will have to replace five graduating players from last year’s roster, including three who frequently started.
Junior libero Brooks Varni will take over for Henry Cassiday, who started at the position for four years, and senior Cristian Rivera will become the primary opposite hitter after the graduation of Tanner Jansen, who also started all four years.
The Trojans also lost the services of Maddison McKibbin, who started matches at outside hitter and opposite, as well as outside hitter Joey Booth and setter Paul Yoder, who both appeared in matches.
The 2014 Trojans, who finished 16-11 overall as well as 14-10 in conference, finished in eighth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, arguably the toughest conference in all of men’s volleyball, last year, qualifying as the last team in the 14-team conference to make the MPSF tournament. However, the Trojans were defeated in the first round of the tournament, which determined an automatic qualifier for the national championship tournament, by first-seeded BYU and did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
While the Trojans did not win the national championship, they were the only opponents to beat the team that did. Loyola-Chicago claimed the national title with a record of 29-1 on the season, and that lone loss came to USC when the Trojans went to visit Chicago before the start of conference play.
In program history, the Trojans have won four national titles. Ferguson is coming into his ninth year at the helm of the program and he’s made the NCAA tournament three times but he is still looking for his first national championship.
The last time the Trojans appeared in the tournament was 2012, when they advanced to the championship game but fell to UC Irvine.
Ferguson says this year’s team resembles that 2012 team a lot, bringing very much a blue-collar and hard working approach to the game. He believes that this could finally be the year when the Trojans win it all.
It’s the most ‘together’ team we’ve had since I’ve been here,” he said. “We’re going to work our tails off to get [to the NCAA tournament].”
The No. 7 Trojans won their season opener on the road against Grand Canyon in five sets on Jan. 7 and play their home opener tonight against No. 2 Pepperdine in the Galen Center at 8:00 p.m. USC also hosts No. 10 Stanford on Monday at 5:00 p.m.

From the caustic poetry of the Roman luminary Horace to the faux conservative punditry of Stephen Colbert, the purpose of satire has always been to speak truth to power, to expose the evils of extremism, sectarianism, corruption, hypocrisy and ignorance by holding them up for merciless ridicule. To borrow a phrase from humorist Finley Peter Dunne’s definition of good journalism, the best examples of satire are meant to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.
In a perfect world, the right to offend and the right to be offended would be exercised peacefully, balanced forever in a state of reluctant harmony, but the horrific events of the past few weeks have demonstrated just how far we are from achieving a state of reasonable discourse when it comes to satire in popular entertainment, specifically as it relates to politics and religion. The right to express oneself without fear of persecution has always been a universal desire, but it deserves to become a universal right.
The Sony hacking scandal and last Wednesday’s senseless attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo over the publishing of a caricature of the prophet Muhammad have one thing in common: both actions were perpetrated by tantrum-prone fanatics who despise anything that goes beyond their immediate understanding and control.
While attempting to block the release of The Interview — a better-than-average Seth Rogen comedy with purple haze delusions of sociopolitical relevance — using an arsenal of leaked emails and grammatically challenged terror threats pales in comparison to the lives lost during the Paris tragedy, both events serve as sobering reminders of the necessity of protecting free speech, even when said speech mainly revolves around pot and penis jokes.
As the “Je suis Charlie” phenomenon picked up steam around the world, many online commentators were quick to point out the publication’s reputation for producing cartoons that could be considered racist, misogynistic, homophobic and insensitive to nearly every major world religion. Taken as a whole, however, these claims combine to form a picture that looks suspiciously similar to the textbook definition of “equal opportunity offender.”
Much of the invective currently being hurled at Charlie Hebdo could be applied to any given episode of South Park, a series that weathered its own Muhammad-centric controversy back in 2010 when an episode featuring the prophet in a bear suit aired once and was subsequently pulled from reruns after Comedy Central received veiled threats from an online militant group known as Revolution Muslim. South Park also manages the unlikely feat of being arguably the most moral show on television week after week by pairing incisive yet evenhanded social commentary with proudly lowbrow, often scatological humor.
Should the editors of Charlie Hebdo be condemned simply because they don’t possess the razor-sharp vulgarian sensibilities of South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone? After all, the advocacy of unpopular ideas, including graceless and purposely provocative satire, is a central tent of free speech. In the end, I suppose it all comes down to that old quote from Voltaire’s biographer Evelyn Beatrice Hall, which is often misattributed to the old satirist himself: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”
The Interview, meanwhile, might have failed as an attempt at Dr. Strangelove-style political lampooning, but it certainly did an effective job of skewering the entertainment news industry personified by Dave Skylark (James Franco), the vacuous talk show host whose deep-seated insecurities and extreme susceptibility to flattery lead him to strike up an ill-fated bromance with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, played by the scene-stealing Randall Park as a petulant yet oddly adorable man-child.
This unflattering portrait of the media was reciprocated by the spotty real-life coverage of the Sony hack, where numerous news outlets made it appear as if the studio itself had been solely responsible for pulling the plug on the movie’s theatrical release, ignoring the fact that all five major theater chains had already declined to screen the $44 million film prior to the decision.
No matter the form or quality, satire needs to be jealously safeguarded, oftentimes by the very establishment it mocks. The benefit of good satire goes far beyond laughing at those in power. At its finest, it can disarm those who would seek to use fear as a weapon. The greatest works of satire aren’t basely cynical; they’re actually trying to urge society forward by calling attention to important issues. Charlie Chaplin wasn’t just getting even with Adolf Hitler for copying his toothbrush mustache when he made his 1940 sound-era masterpiece The Great Dictator. The movie, a send-up of fascism in all its mechanized, goose-stepping pomposity, was Chaplin’s way of exhorting the U.S. to confront the threat of Nazism before it swallowed all of Europe. That’s the true function of satire: to ring out a warning before it’s too late to do anything but die laughing.
Individual decide whether or not to take offense. Individuals decide whether or not to use demagogy to incite violence. Every action must be thought over and enacted by an individual using the tools at their disposal.

The Syfy channel has been notorious lately for its over-the-top shark-involved Z-movie releases, such as Sharktopus vs Pteracuda and Sharknado. These films, with their overt silliness and cheesy special effects, brought Syfy plenty of attention. Even as they are a far cry from the science fiction implied by their channel’s name.
However, after the intriguing first season of Helix last year finally brought science fiction back onto the slate, Syfy has, with gusto, revived a classic sci-fi story with their new 12 Monkeys series.
The show based on the script for Terry Gilliam’s 1995 cult classic of the same name, is is similar to  the recent trend of mid-90s cult movies being made into TV series. (Fargo, originally released in 1996, found an electrifying new life as an FX series last year, and From Dusk Till Dawn, also from 1996, had a enjoyably pulpy first season on the El Rey Network.) However, like those series before it, 12 Monkeys seems to have found an interesting, new spirit in the source material.
The story revolves around a man being sent back in time from a dystopian future to try and prevent what will become a devastating pandemic. Gilliam’s film has the director’s unmistakably weird fingerprints all over it. The story is important, but so is his manic, psychedelic vision of the story. As far as the series goes, the Syfy channel has trimmed the fat. Instead of trying to imitate Gilliam, which probably would have been a disaster, the story has been repurposed as an entertaining, action-packed thrill ride.
Aaron Stanford plays the male lead, who was portrayed by Bruce Willis in the original. Stanford is perhaps best known for his supporting role as the fire-wielding mutant Pyro in X-Men 2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. Here, he seems comfortable in the lead. The lead role in a time-travel action story is more about the charisma an actor can bring to the role than his acting chops, and Stanford brings plenty of screen presence as the man struggling to grasp the things he has to do to save the human race.
The basic story is essentially a hyper-driven version of the famous thought experiment where one is given the choice between letting a train run over 10 people or flipping the switch to put the train on a new track and killing one person. Stanford handles his character’s struggle with this dilemma more skillfully than one has a right to ask for in a series like this.
The rest of the cast is also rock solid. Amanda Schull also puts in an excellent performance as the second lead Dr. Cassandra Railly. Her role has been modified and expanded from the one Madeleine Stowe played in the original film. The character has changed from psychiatrist to virologist and has taken on a more prominent role. Emily Hempshire takes on the role which Brad Pitt knocked out of the park in the original. Pitt put in one of the best performances of his career as the insane Goines, but Hempshire has taken a more subtle tack to the role. Pitt’s performance had to be a heck of an act to follow, but Hempshire has found her own way with the character and it will be interesting to see where she takes it. Always great character actor Zjelko Ivanek also provides his ability to play sneaky, slimy antagonists.
Despite the surprising quality of the cast, the real star of the story is the time travel. Cole’s jumps through time are at the center of the story, both in driving the plot and in providing the most memorable scenes of the pilot. These scenes are all fun, but are often familiar to those familiar with time travel fiction. Like in the film, the time travel technology is inexact. So, in a plot development that will be nothing new to fans of Doctor Who, Cole appears to Railly in 2013 only to disappear for two years leaving Railly waiting for the mysterious time traveler to reappear while questioning her sanity.
In another familiar scene, Cole proves to Railly that he is indeed from the future by showing her own watch from the future and scratching her watch in the present to show her how the scratch appears on her future watch. Scenes like these appeared throughout Rian Johnson’s very fun Looper. Those scenes were also the biggest source of complaints about Looper’s time travel science. Namely, when you mutilate the past version of a person, more is probabilistically expected to change in the world than just those injuries magically appearing on the future version of the person. The leaps in the 12 Monkey’s scenes are a little less egregious, but as should be the rule with all time travel stories, it is probably best to accept the rules of the world and proceed with a healthy ability to accept suspend disbelief. If one is able to do that, then when scenes like Cole bringing the past and present watches together to create a paradox explosion, it can be a pure moment of excitement, without worrying about what would make a makeshift time paradox produce what amounts to a MacGyvered grenade.
12 Monkeys looks like a time bending rollercoaster courtesy of Syfy. It may have lost some of the frenetic philosophizing of the first one, but it is its departure from the vision of the original film that has allowed the 12 Monkeys series to take on a life of its own.

There are not enough tissues in the world’s largest allergy clinic to last you through Still Alice, a film based on The New York Times best selling novel of the same name by Lisa Genova. Directed by Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, Still Alice transcends its tissue-level sadness to tell a story that is as inspiring as it is heart wrenching.
Dr. Alice Howland is a linguistics professor at Columbia who has built a reputation as one of the top academics in her field. Around that, she has built a loving family with her husband John and her three children, Lydia, Anna and Tom. Then, Alice starts to forget words. She gets lost running home one day. As her lapses grow, she sees a neurologist who diagnoses her with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
What Ronald Reagan famously described as the “journey that will take me into the sunset of my life” is anything but sunny for Alice, who faces a struggle to preserve her former self. As Alice (brilliantly played by Julianne Moore) begins to lose everything she spent her entire life working for, her husband (Alec Baldwin) and three children struggle to remember their mother for the woman she once was, not the woman she is becoming. The film’s storytelling is crystal clear. It powerfully zeroes in on Alzheimer’s impact on the everyday routines of those it effects.
The family’s bonds are tested. For years, Alice disagreed with the decision of her youngest child Lydia (Kristen Stewart) to become an actress and forego the college life pursued by her two older siblings. As Lydia watches her mother become a shadow, their disagreement pales in comparison to Lydia’s desire to grow closer to her mother before it’s too late. Alice’s husband John, a renowned medical doctor played by the perennially creepy-voiced Alec Baldwin, is forced to continue his high-level career and caring for his wife in her terminal stages.
Still Alice is not just a film about a dying woman. The films’ score and cinematography paint a comprehensive, complex and visually real picture of the terrifying toll Alzheimer’s takes on Alice and her family. At one point, she laments the less-than sexy nature of her disease in popular culture, comparing it to the large fundraisers and media attention devoted to other terminal illnesses like cancer.
Still Alice is an authentic reminder to appreciate life and find meaning in adversity, a message known all too well by directors and husbands Westmoreland and Glatzer. The couple were thrown into the same struggle as Alice when Glatzer was diagnosed with ALS in 2011, and their insight into the battle with a terminal illness unquestionably lends the film insight that is irreplaceable.
In a beautiful way, that personal experience allows Still Alice to never come across as a tired cliche film preaching to “live every day like its your last.” Instead, it will leave you with a deeper respect for memory and family, things taken for granted far too often. If you leave without this deeper respect, you might have seen a different movie.
The struggle depicted would also not be nearly as powerful without the genius brought forth by Julianne Moore. Moore received the Golden Globe for best actress in a major motion picture and is a favorite to receive the Academy Award in the same category, an award she deserves as much as anyone in the field. Her insight into Alice’s simultaneous brilliance as a professor and vulnerability as Alzheimer’s robs her of that brilliance is breathtaking. Moore’s ability to communicate that insight? Even more incredible. In Still Alice, Moore delivers one of the most complex performances an actress could ever be tasked with, and delivers it masterfully.
While you would be remiss to forget the tissues at home, you would be even more remiss to not see Still Alice. One of the most emotionally gripping films of the year, it will forever occupy a high place in the genre of films dedicated to celebrating life and the struggles it presents.

Democratic legislators in the minority of Congress are waiting for the 2016 election, joined by prospective Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. One question should ring in their minds:
Who are we?
It is not a question of identifying the Democratic politicians by name or face. It is about crafting a message and theme that identify the party. To be successful going forward, the Democrats need to reclaim a bit of early Obama magic. Six years in the White House has left them unable to trumpet the same post-Bush administration outsiderism that catapulted them to their 2008 and 2012 victories. The time to tweak their message is now.
In the realm of self-improvement, one of the things harder than learning from personal mistakes is learning from the success of opponents. The ramifications of the Democrats’ identity crisis became painfully clear when the 114th Congress was elected with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives and a new Republican majority in the Senate. The Senate Democrats found themselves on the outside looking in. The hardest pill for the Democrats to swallow is recognizing that their turnaround is as much about emulating Republican success as it is about learning from their own failure.
Democrats can get the rebranding ball rolling by smoothing over divisions within their party, like the one that erupted between the White House and Senate Democrats who publicly criticized Obama for being lukewarm to fundraise for them prior to the 2014 midterms. They can also learn from Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s failure to win the presidency in 2012, a failure largely blamed on the massive rightward shift to win the primary election amid criticism from more radical candidates. Republicans, however, followed up this defeat with success in the 2014 midterms largely because they were able to weed out radical candidates, who could be linked to other Republican candidates by voters. In Colorado, for example, the GOP ousted radical Republican candidate Ken Buck and replaced him with now-Senator Cory Gardner. The result? An upset victory of Democratic incumbent Mark Udall. In Mississippi, the GOP election machine leaked embarrassing audio of Tea Party member Chris McDaniel speaking insensitively about slavery and women. The ramifications allowed the more moderate incumbent, Thad Cochran, to coast to reelection in the general.
Democrats should pursue that same agenda in their quest to take back the Senate. For example, the 2016 spotlight will shine brightly on California, due to the retirement of longtime Senator Barbara Boxer. The 2016 election will feature the state’s first Senate race without a Democratic incumbent since 1992. Because of new California election laws allowing the top two finishers in the primary to compete in the general election regardless of party affiliation, it is likely that the general election will feature two Democrats. It is imperative that those Democrats avoid the same brand of infighting that dragged down Romney in 2012.
These lessons are transferable and perhaps more important for Democrats seeking to retain the White House in 2016. Another lesson from the Republican reemergence is the party’s attempt to distance themselves from the Tea Party. As Republicans realize that elections are still winnable without the Bible Belt-right, so too can Democrats realize that the overly progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren is largely unelectable before a moderate voters. Warren officially ruled out a run for the presidency this week, but her progressive counterparts like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have not. Electorates in primary elections tend to be more extreme — further heightening the danger that such candidates emerge as likely contenders — and further heightening the need for the party establishment to pressure those candidates out of the race.
To put it all together, Democrats need a message that rings with moderates as well. They also need a message that isn’t overly presidential. A “Ready for Hillary” vision might get them the White House but won’t get them back the Congress. For the Republicans in 2014, it was anti-Obama, Obama, Obama. So who are the Democrats? As the economy improves, the Democrats have a credible argument to cast themselves as the party that, over Republican obstruction that included shutting down the government, guided the nation out of the Great Recession. Their policies, beginning with the stimulus package, put Americans back to work. The time for progressivism will come — but it isn’t an election year message. It will only be possible after convincing voters that Democratic politicians in the House, White House and Senate are worth trusting for another two, four or six more years.

It is hard to call one’s vision “progressive” when the majority of the people won’t vote for it. It is hard to gain votes for one’s vision, when the marketing and branding are for a different vision. 
Obamacare’s advertised vision was lower health care costs and better access. The outcome is highly varied – the few have seen better access and lower costs (only through subsidies); the majority have seen limited choices and higher costs (to pay the subsidies). The Obama advertised vision was to spread the wealth around (meaning the poor would get more subsidies and the rich would be taxed more). The Obama outcome is that the wealth gap has widened and bailouts to politically favored companies. The Obama advertised vision was for better relations with Islam. The outcome is thousands of drone attacks in Islamic countries. 
If the advertising matched the outcomes, the people would have clear choices. Does the “D” party stand for the wealthy through bailouts and subsidies? Does the “D” party stand for free speech (even when it is offensive)? Does the “D” party stand for robotic warfare? Does the “D” party stand for government spying on political enemies? Does the “D” party stand for wiretapping the media? Does the “D” party stand for government intervention in marriage and other relationships between people? Does the “D” party stand for second guessing the local police and local schools? Does the “D” party stand for bigger government – if so how much bigger? Does the “D” party believe in big debt – if so how much debt and how independent is  a country mired in debt???

Last month, 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn was killed by a semi-trailer in Ohio. What seemed like an accident was later confirmed as a suicide, as Alcorn had arranged for a suicide note to be automatically posted to her Tumblr page. She explained her depression was the result of gender identity. Alcorn, a transgender teen, was denied transitional surgery by her parents, which frustrated her and angered many. It is, however, ineffective to accuse her parents, as discrimination toward the transgender population is rooted in society.
Alcorn always felt as if she were a girl trapped in a boy’s body. At 14, she learned about being transgender and was able to accurately define herself. Her parents did not share the same sentiment. Doug and Carla Alcorn refused to accept their child’s desire for a gender change and insisted instead on sending Alcorn to Christian conversion therapy. Even after her daughter’s death, Carla Alcorn continued to refer to Alcorn as her “son” Joshua, and claims to never have heard the name “Leelah.” In an interview with CNN, Carla Alcorn said: “I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy” She added that she was scared of the public’s reaction and the revelations of her daughter. In her suicide note, Alcorn mentioned the lack of support from her parents, who repeatedly struck down her confidence in her newfound self. After apologizing to some people, she writes to her parents, “F-ck you. You can’t just control other people like that.”
After her note was published, the public portrayed Alcorn’s parents as people who killed their daughter. According to the Huffington Post, people responded, “Don’t say Leelah Alcorn’s suicide was selfish. Driving your kid to suicide because you’re scared of a ‘bad image,’ that’s selfish.” Another tweeter expressed, “Please do not have children if you are not prepared to love them for whoever they end up being.”  The media, however, has failed to understand that this problem does not stop at a set of close-minded, Christian parents.
Parental rejection of transsexualism should definitely be categorized as child neglect, though parents cannot be fully blamed. Responsible parents act on behalf of what they believe are their children’s best interests and in the process can act in ways that hurt. From this perspective, parents are not abusing their children but nurturing them in a way that is accepted by society. Parents who deny sex changes for their children hope to shield them from bullying, rejection and what society has defined as “wrong.” According to the American Civil Liberties Union, transgender people suffer many legal problems from health care barriers to identity documents that do not reflect their true sex. So, it makes sense that  parents believe that they are not abusing their children; they think they are helping their children avoid the obstacles a stigma creates.
Society is the culprit for transgender discrimination. When the Alcorns rejected Alcorn’s identity, it was because they did not want their child to grow up being denied of their rights. For example, last week, a woman was fired from Saks Fifth Avenue due to her transgender identity. This week, InTouch Weekly published a Photoshopped image of Bruce Jenner, making fun of the rumors of his sex change. These negative attitudes toward the transgender community have brought others to discourage sex change to save their loved ones from scorn. Furthermore, there are many conversion groups, from the Christian conversion therapy, to which Alcorn was sent, to “Gay Cure” camps that people have justified in the hopes of saving their loved ones from harassment.
Hopefully, transgender individuals become more accepted in the contemporary world, with less cases like Alcorn’s. To avoid these situations, Alcorn’s death cannot solely be blamed on the fact that her parents denied her a sex change. It has to be blamed on the environment that made her parents believe that being transgender is shameful. This is not a matter of incriminating parents. This is a matter of looking at our own prejudices on a larger scope. Changing the way we educate everyone to accept others despite their differences will decrease the rate of abuse and suicides. Discrimination drives people to abuse, which encompasses more than physical and sexual maltreatment. Though emotional abuse is found in Leelah Alcorn’s fight to define her own identity, it does not come from her parents. This abuse stems from society.
Society is made up of individuals. People can march to the societal beat or choose their own drummer. Individuals choose and must endure the consequences of their choices.

As a part of a university-wide Mindful USC initiative, the Annenberg Digital Lounge will sponsor a “Digital Detox” in its new Mindfulness + Creativity Lab.
The seven-week course, open to Annenberg students, faculty and staff, will serve as an introduction to incorporating mindfulness into all aspects of life. The Annenberg Digital Lounge, which offers instruction on digital programming, hopes to also foster creativity by encouraging students and faculty to turn off devices and be mindful.
“A ubiquitous problem for students at this university is that they are constantly connected. You can see it and feel it. We have a responsibility to say ‘take some time off,’” said Courtney Miller, creative director of the Digital Lounge. “Wallis Annenberg Hall, even with its massive media wall and overwhelming digital connectivity, is an interesting place for this conversation on mindfulness to take place.”
While in the past, Annenberg has invested significant resources to inspire students’ creativity through exposure to an abundance of digital media content from news sources and interactive content, this program seeks to achieve the same means by using an opposite tactic.
According to Miller, the course is designed to improve participants’ emotional intelligence, reduce stress and promote mindful interactions. Miller collaborated with Professor Allen Weiss of the Marshall School of Business to create the Digital Detox program. Weiss, an expert in marketing, also serves as a mindfulness meditation teacher at InsightLA, as well as the co-chair of the Mindful USC initiative. Weiss views the Mindfulness + Creativity Lab as a way to integrate his outside expertise in the meditation field into his engagement of students at the university.
“Mindfulness has been shown by a great deal of careful research to lower anxiety, ruminating thoughts, stress and all the other mental and emotional problems that get in the way of people performing well and being creative. This is what Mindful USC is all about,” Weiss said in a statement. “What I’ll be doing with the Mindfulness + Creativity Lab is teaching mindfulness [geared] towards people who are doing creative work — helping them remove the blocks to creativity through mindfulness.”
The program directors hope that Mindfulness + Creativity Lab will host more programs similar to the Digital Detox in the future, and hopefully expand to other academic colleges within the university. The Annenberg Digital Lounge has already partnered with a student group from the Roski School of Art and Design and hopes to partner with KXSC and the Thornton School of Music.
Miller was first inspired to promote mindfulness while teaching digital journalism as a part of the University of Virginia’s “semester at sea” program. During the four years that Miller spent living and interacting with students on the semester-long trip, she realized that disconnecting from technology could improve innovation and creativity. Miller now leads a team of a dozen graduate students that run a help desk for students in the Annenberg Digital Lounge.
The Annenberg Digital Lounge’s Digital Detox program comes in the face of Dean Ernest J. Wilson III’s efforts to improve digital literacy, as well as Annenberg’s partnership with Adobe Systems, which made the Adobe Creative Cloud available for free to the school’s students, faculty and staff.
The Paul Richardson Student Help desk will be staffed by a team of graduate students from a variety of academic disciplines, including the School of Cinematic Arts, the School of Architecture and Roski. The team acts as media support specialists and audio, video and web support to students via informal learning sessions.
The Digital Detox program is set to begin on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Individuals who are interested in participating in the course are encouraged to register the Annenberg Digital Lounge website. The program will take place in the Digital Lounge’s newly launched work space, located on the third floor of Wallis Annenberg Hall.

Following its approval in the Undergraduate Student Government Senate last fall, Undergraduate Student Government plan to move forward with the Black House project this semester.
Though the project will not come to fruition for another five to 10 years, four student task force teams are working to submit a proposal to the university administration by the end of February.
Two challenging obstacles to the proposal’s completion is securing an actual property, since there is competition from real estate companies, and drafting financial plans for the project.
Skylar Dunn, co-director of Diversity Affairs, is leading the team in charge of the fundraising and real estate search. Dunn has confirmed that his group is working alongside a real estate expert to potentially secure a property in the area north of the University Park campus.
Students have also recruited the help of Northwestern University’s Black House director, Dr. Charles Kellom, to introduce sustainability models that will allow USC’s house to run for decades without charging students for its use.
Levi Powell, the proposal’s author and logistics and vision team facilitator, explained that the house would not be a living space.  Instead, the house will offer “mentorship, academic programs and a space for conversations about issues of the day” to support students “academically, socially and morally,” explained Powell in an email statement.
To that end, the house’s basic amenities would include a multipurpose room and cultural galleries. The house would also offer nap rooms for student use in the afternoons, and a student-run coalition would be responsible for creating programs to foster an academic environment.  The task force plans to work closely with the USC Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs.
Education and appreciation of the varied cultural and ethnic roots of all black people are central to the vision of the house. The task force on education, communication, public relations and social media are arranging campaigns to bring student awareness to the mixed backgrounds and identities of black people.
The education task force is planning community classes for children, educational field trips and seminar courses for the USC community on issues such as black feminism, the African Diaspora and the 1992 LA Riots.
“Blackness is not a monolith,” said Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, Program Board executive director and facilitator for the Black House’s Education group. “When they lump everyone under one umbrella term it can really mess with kids’ identities.”
Next week, the communication, public relations and social media task force will unveil an inclusive “I, Too, Am USC” campaign next week modeled after the popular Harvard-based photo campaign featuring the college experiences of often underrepresented student groups.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath is co-leading the communication, public relations and social media task force.
“What students should understand is that [the Black House] is meant to serve as a stepping stone for other student groups to amplify their voices,” she said.
Thus, the project is more than just a black house initiative; it is meant to shed light on why specific movements are necessary for marginalized groups on USC’s campus.
The university’s response to the idea has been supportive thus far.  Vice Provost of Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry and Executive Director of the Black Alumni Association Michele Turner are helping students ensure the proposal contains the necessary information. It won’t be until the university reviews it, however, that USC will collaborate in connecting students to investors and funding sources.
“The real work comes after the proposal,” Dunn said. “We are dependent on the Trojan family to be more than a phrase right now. This can go really big if someone just believes in us.”

In December, USC’s newest school, the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy wrapped its first semester with its first class of 31 students. The Academy’s curriculum was developed by its director, Dean of the Roski School of Fine Arts Erica Muhl, focuses on three areas of study: art and design, engineering, business and venture management. The programming also emphasizes collaboration and innovation.
“Our goal is to ensure that the Academy is the most collaborative educational program in the world,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement.
The Academy, which was founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young, known by his stage name, Dr. Dre, is made up of 31 students, each selected for the program for “proven ability in original thought,” according to the school’s website. The curriculum includes independent applied techniques and technology classes, courses on innovation and cultural change, and skills-based courses.
“The thing that I had hoped most for the students in the Iovine and Young Academy is that they would find a couple things when they came to USC,” Muhl said. “First, the Trojan family, but also an environment that encourages who they are as individuals as well as highlighting the strengths in teamwork.”
According to Muhl, the garage, located on the fourth floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, provides the ideal environment for fostering the kind of learning the Academy strives to maintain.
“The garage as a facility has proven to be everything that we had hoped,” Muhl said. “The facility, not only as an instruction but also as an ideation space, allows students both inside and outside class to be constantly envisioning.”
The environment that has been created in the Academy’s first semester extends beyond the physical.
“As we can see so far, one of the most successful aspects of the Iovine and Young Academy as a whole has been the strength of the cohort we have built,” Muhl said. “Each time I walk into the garage and see groups of Academy students working on projects that are not necessarily assigned with such enthusiasm really reinforces what I had hoped to do with this program.”
The Academy has already made headway toward completing its first-year goal of introducing students to cross-disciplinary study. Students have learned about the history of disruptive innovation, and courses have both integrated the core disciplines of computer science, business and venture management and taught their skills individually.
“I believe that the precise experience that the Academy offers was very welcome to a certain type of student and it is exciting to have been able to build that,” Muhl said. “The students are learning from us but we are absolutely learning from them.”
In this way, the innovative and collaborative aspects of the Academy’s curriculum carry over into the development of the program. A successful first semester might be somewhat attributed to the adaptive nature of the program and its students.
Amri Rigby, a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation explained that the application process for the Academy includes a proposal video and interviews in addition to the Common Application.
“My experience has been amazing. I am surrounded by a lot of talented people with a diverse set of skills,” said Rigby. “I am thankful for the opportunity. I’ve grown so much after only one semester.”
Muhl attributes the program’s success to its ability to adjust to change.
“The Iovine and Young Academy is a brand new program, so we knew there were going to be surprises,” Muhl said. “We have learned a great deal already, both in terms of how to perfect what might not be one hundred percent and to expand upon the many good ideas that are already in place. The program was built in such a way to be able to respond with great agility.”
Muhl, as well as the faculty and the rest of the administration of the Academy look to the future as applications for the next school year are submitted this month.
“Our applications for the 2015-2016 academic year look spectacular,” Muhl said. “We are up in application numbers and the pool, once again, looks very talented and really well prepared for this type of an experience.”
The future for the Academy, according to both its students and its faculty, looks bright as the program and curriculum continue to grow and develop.
“I am just hoping that each year we can learn more than we did the year before,” Muhl said. “I believe we can build upon not only the strength of our exceptional faculty but upon what students are able to bring to the program.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Academy founders Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young contributed to the development of the program’s curriculum. The founders were not involved in curriculum development. The previous version also stated that the class was made up of 25 students. There are 31 students in the program. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

On Wednesday afternoon, USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services workers held a protest on Childs Way near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center demanding higher wages.
About 20 food service workers marched and chanted from noon until about 5 p.m.
This marks the first protest by USC workers in the spring semester. Though the workers conducted larger protests in 2014, this is the first demonstration on campus grounds.
The dialogue between the workers, represented by Unite Here Local 11 union, and the university began last summer.
“We have been negotiating since July but we have not reached an agreement,” said Maria Villalobos, a university food service worker. “Our lawyer and their lawyer have been in talks but we have not reached a deal.”
Villalobos, who has been a university employee for 42 years, explained that the protests have come after a series of unsuccessful meetings with the university. She explained how some of her colleagues have been suffering due to the low wages and limited hours allowed to work.
Last year, Local 11 union, along with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, held demonstrations to the same issue. They claim that most of the workers protesting are paid less than $20,000 per year, a figure that traps them below poverty line.
“We have had three protests in the 42 years I have worked here,” said Villalobos. She explained that the contract negotiations have stalled because the university is offering an increase of about 25 cents per hour after five years since the last negotiations.
“We are going to continue to put pressure on them until there is a fair agreement.  The current wages for these workers are simply not reasonable,” said Christian Torres, the union organizer who represents the workers.
If the university fails to meet the worker’s demands, another protest is scheduled for Jan. 29.

After taking a year off from coaching, ex-USC coach Ed Orgeron has decided to join the LSU coaching staff as their defensive line coach. The position allows Orgeron to stay close to home.
In 2013, after a disappointing start to the football season for USC, head coach Lane Kiffin was fired, and former energetic defensive line coach Ed Orgeron was instated as the interim head coach. Orgeron and his fiery personality took the school by storm leading the football team to a 6-2 record before he resigned.
Much of the student body and alumni were upset that Athletic Director Pat Haden passed on Coach O and chose then-Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian to be the next leader of USC’s team. The school rallied around Orgeron, and many hoped that he would eventually return to the cardinal and gold in some capacity.
During this past college football season, Orgeron spent time with his family in his Louisiana home, where he rooted for his sons, Cody and Parker, who played tennis and football respectively for Mandeville High School. But now it will be back to business for Coach O.
It will be a homecoming for Orgeron when he joins LSU head coach Les Miles and newly hired defensive coordinator Kevin Steele on the Tigers coaching staff. When Orgeron played football, he committed to LSU, but after two weeks, he felt homesick and left the program. Now Orgeron has the opportunity to join his oldest son, Tyler Spotts, in the LSU organization.
In a statement made after the hiring, Miles acknowledged how great of a hire Orgeron was for his football team.
“Ed is an expert when it comes to the defensive line,” said Miles. “He will bring tremendous enthusiasm and energy to our program. His passion and love for the state of Louisiana makes him a great fit for us.”
This season, LSU was considered to have a down year, finishing with a record of 8-5. Luckily Orgeron will be joining a top-10 defense with the Tigers. LSU gave up 4.87 yards per play and only 27 opponent touchdowns. Coach O will now have to coach a young defensive line, which has to replace their leading pass rusher in junior Danielle Hunter.
Though Orgeron will now be considered a Tiger, to the USC faithful, he will always be a Trojan.

In their spring season opener, No. 14 USC faced off against unranked Loyola Marymount at Manhattan Country Club and didn’t drop a set on their way to a 7-0 victory.
“The girls played really well for their first match of the season,” said coach Richard Gallien. “It was a great start to our season.”
Despite their record last season, Gallien stressed the fact that his team has nothing but respect for LMU and how hard they fought.
“LMU is a terrific team,” he said. “And we take everybody seriously.”
The Women of Troy began their dual match play by securing the lone doubles point. Gabby Smith and Madison Westby shut out their opponents 6-0. To complement their success, the teams of Gabriella DeSimone and Zoë Scandalis, along with Zoë Katz and her partner Sabrina Santamaria, won their matches with a dominating score of 6-2.
On the singles side of the match, No. 44-ranked Scandalis won 6-2, 6-4, defeating LMU’s top player, Jessica Perez.  Power freshmen Smith and Westby won their matches 6-3, 6-1, and 6-1, 6-2 respectively.
“Our freshmen played awesome today,” said Gallien in response to the team’s domination of the outmatched Lions.
The two other ranked players including No. 98-ranked DeSimone and No. 119-ranked Zoë Katz also showed convincing starts to their season by winning 6-2, 6-2, and 6-0, 6-1.
Santamaria, a senior, made her return to the court memorable, following a 10-month absence as she recovered from a torn anterior cruciate ligament. By defeating Kylie Waschuk 6-1, 6-0, Santamaria clinched the victory for USC Wednesday afternoon.
“I was very proud of Sabrina in her return from her ACL injury,” coach West Nott said Wednesday evening. “What a great job she has done rehabbing over the last nine months, and then to contribute to the team today was amazing to see…“She is a critical part of this team and she will play a key role in our success this season.”
The Women of Troy will not have much time off, however, as some of the team will now travel to Palm Springs, California, to compete in the National Collegiate Tennis Classic.
The rest of the team will be participating in the Freeman Memorial Tournament in Las Vegas,  Nevada.

The spring semester has sprung upon us yet again, signifying a fresh start and new beginnings for many students, and for me, the stimulating journey as sports editor of this momentous publication.
While this has been a long time coming for me and something that I always envisioned myself doing when I set foot on USC’s campus, it wasn’t always the dream.
Rather, when I was a kid, I aspired to be a professional athlete, specifically the one and only Kobe Bryant. Yes, the one dubbed “The Black Mamba” and, who just a month ago passed up Michael Jordan for third on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.
When I initially shared my dreams with my elders, I got the answer one would expect from a pragmatic adult: “Yeah, that’s great and all to dream big, son, but do you know the chances of you actually becoming a professional basketball player?”
Sadly, they were right, as only a handful of kids ever make it to the professional game, and though the statistics of the reality continued to make more and more sense as I grew up, I never let the dream of being like Kobe go.
Though I couldn’t be like the 16-time NBA all-star on the court, it didn’t mean that I couldn’t, one day, be able to capture his competitive mentality and strong work ethic off the court.
This inspiration came to mind during my first year of high school when like the great Michael Jordan, according to legend, I was cut from the freshman basketball team.
Not being able to find your name on a list, believing it has to be there somewhere while watching your friends celebrate joyously, is perhaps one of the hardest things I’ve had to experience in my young life.
But what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, right? And from that day on, I had a chip on my shoulder, knowing that I had something to prove, not only to my coaches, my peers and my family, but also to myself.
Following Bryant’s most recent record-setting performance, he took to The Player’s Tribune in a first-person editorial called “Zero.” The title represents the zero points, which Bryant scored the summer he played in his hometown summer league at the young age of 12.
In the piece, Bryant described how he was putting his family to shame, namely his father, Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, who played professional basketball domestically and overseas.
Oddly enough, Kobe wrote that he even considered giving up basketball before he too realized the fact that his idol, MJ, used his sense of failure to fuel his fire to make certain that those feelings never arose again.
In the words of the five-time NBA champion, “I decided to take on my challenge the same way he [MJ] did.” And so did I.
Using that same can’t-quit mentality and persistence, I strutted into tryouts a year later and this time around, my name was, indeed, on the list on the gym door.
Aside from basketball, it’s this determined frame of mind that has gotten me to where I am today.
Full disclosure, I was hoping to be in the seat I am today at the DT one whole year ago. It felt like deja vu when I scrolled up and down an email, and yet again, couldn’t find my name.
Here, I was presented with a different situation, but a very familiar foe.
Sure, I could accept the notion of failure again, but I couldn’t accept not trying. And one year later, here I am, simply because, in the words of the late and great NC State basketball coach Jim Valvano, I never gave up. That inspiration to keep pressing on and attempting to achieve something I had already once failed at derived from what I had learned from the experiences of world-class athletes.
We often look up to superstars like Kobe and MJ not because of their prowess on the court, but rather for who they are as individuals. None of these athletes is without their flaws, blemishes and even legal issues, but as Hannah Montana puts it, “nobody’s perfect.” That’s what makes them like each and every one of us at the end of the day.
But, don’t get me wrong, 99 percent of us, including myself, will never ever be on the same pedestal as either of these legends, regardless of how hard we work. We still have the opportunity and ability, however, to incorporate into our everyday lives the mentality that allowed them to rise to greatness and legendary status into our everyday lives.
I’m not a professional athlete, but you don’t have to play sports to be like one.
Just take for example the parallel drawn between Los Angeles Clippers star Chris Paul and his fictional twin brother, Cliff Paul, in State Farm Insurance’s recent advertisement campaign. Of course, Chris dishes out his assists on the basketball court to the likes of Blake Griffin, while Cliff, a State Farm agent, assists his customers with their problems out in the field. Evidently, both have assisting in their blood, but each uses their talent in different realms.
Even for someone whose life is engulfed in sports, the concept of employing bits and pieces of an athlete’s arsenal into mine hasn’t always been easy to grasp, but it’s finally started to come to fruition for me as I begin my tenure as sports editor of the Daily Trojan.
Unfortunately, I won’t be able to dazzle you with my lightning-quick crossover or lethal 3-point shooting on the court this spring. I’ll leave that job to freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin and the rest of the USC men’s basketball team.
But I am hoping that I will be fortunate enough to hit a few last-second jumpers, acrobatic shots and clutch free throws in print during my time at the DT.
Darian Nourian is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Persian Persuasion,” runs Thursdays.

Redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer has decided to forgo his senior season in favor of making himself eligible for the NFL Draft.
Farmer informed head coach Steve Sarkisian of his decision on Monday, the first day of spring classes. Sarkisian said Farmer’s decision caught USC coaches off guard.
“George and I met, and I gave him my thoughts about him leaving USC early, the pros and the cons,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said in a statement. “At the end of the day, he made his decision, so we will support him and wish him the best.”
With the departure of teammate Nelson Agholor, many expected Farmer to return to become the leader of a young receiving corps.
Should Farmer be drafted, his athleticism will have more to do with it than his accomplishments at USC. The former high school standout showed flashes of brilliance, but his success was hindered due to nagging injury problems.
USC recruited Farmer from local high school Gardena Serra along with former Trojan wide receiver Marquise Lee. Farmer was a five-star recruit but failed to live up to the hype or match the accolades of his Serra teammate Lee.
After spending his first two seasons as a backup and special teams player, Farmer was expected to compete for a starting job alongside Lee, but Farmer injured his knee and was forced to redshirt his junior year.
Farmer finally got his chance to contribute to USC during the 2014 season. The speedy wideout caught 25 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns. Farmer’s potential, which coaches had been raving about, was on clear display against rival Notre Dame, where he caught two touchdown passes and set a career high with 85 receiving yards.
USC has now seen four eligible players — defensive end Leonard Williams, running back Javorius “Buck” Allen and receivers Agholor and Farmer — bolt early for the draft.
With Farmer’s departure, USC will be left with just four scholarship receivers in junior Darreus Rogers and sophomores JuJu Smith, Steven Mitchell and Ajene Harris. Sophomore standout Adoree’ Jackson is expected to play some wide receiver next season as well.
USC also has junior college wideouts Isaac Whitney and De’Quan Hampton currently committed to the program.

The Trojans (9-8, 1-4 Pac-12) fell to their crosstown rivals on Wednesday night as UCLA (11-7, 3-2) won 83-66. Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic led USC with 20 points, but the Bruins proved to be too much to handle and they out-rebounded the Trojans 41-20. UCLA was led by senior guard Norman Powell, who scored 22 points, and sophomore guard Bryce Alford continued his efficient scoring with 21 points, including five three-pointers. USC head coach Andy Enfield said after the game that Powell is first-team all-league player in his book after the performance he put on Wednesday night.
The Trojans played with heavy hearts after former head basketball coach Bob Boyd died of natural causes early Wednesday afternoon at the age of 84. Boyd had planned to attend the game with his son, Bill, but he passed away earlier in the day. Boyd went 216-131 with the Trojans from 1967 through 1979. Boyd was also known for his success as a player at USC when he was the team MVP as a senior in 1952. There was a moment of silence before the game to honor the late coach, who died at the age of 84.
Despite the loss off the court, USC fought hard to open up the game, but the Bruins proved to be too tough for this young team. One bright spot was Jovanovic’s performance, but even he recognized the lack of production in the second half that ultimately led to the defeat.
“The difference in the game was just the second half,” said Jovanovic. “I tried to do my best, but everybody needs to contribute and try to play better.”
Enfield cited the lack of production off the bench and overall lack of consistency as two main reasons that contributed to the poor performance. Specifically, freshman guard Elijah Stewart struggled off the bench and only scored 3 points.
Redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark provided a spark off the bench on Wednesday and he ended the game with 11 points.
“We do need some production off our bench,” said Enfield. “Darion finally came in and gave us a big lift off the bench, but if you look at our guards, they did not shoot a high enough percentage for us to win.”
USC shot 41.4 percent from the field but UCLA was able to shoot 56.5 percent, including 62.5 percent in the second half when they really pulled away.
“When UCLA shoots the ball as well as they did tonight, they’re hard to beat because they have very talented players at every position and they shot a high percentage,” said Enfield. “They made a lot of tough shots tonight.”
UCLA’s shooting was what gave them the big lead in the second half, but the Trojans did not compete at the Bruins’ level coming out of halftime.
“We’ve been pretty inconsistent starting the second half. It’s a lot of different things that lead to it,” said Clark. “I just think, as a team, we kind of lose focus, and that’s what happens when you’re a young team. The focus is not always there.”
USC’s rebounding struggles started in the first half as they were out-rebounded 24-10 by the Bruins. Freshman forward Kevon Looney and sophomore guard Isaac Hamilton both had 6 rebounds in the first half as UCLA dominated. Looney finished the game with 12 points and 10 rebounds. UCLA had a balanced rebounding effort and controlled the paint for the entirety of the game which is something that USC players addressed afterwards.
“We just have to be tougher,” said Clark. “It’s as simple as that. They outplayed us, they out toughed us, they killed us on the boards. As a team we just have to be tougher.”
While the Trojans struggled on the glass, Jovanovic and redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt combined for 24 points in the first half and shot a combined 9-15 to keep the game close. Reinhardt helped spark a run with back-to-back threes during an 8-point burst that was followed by seven consecutive points from Jovanovic. The Trojans only trailed by five at the end of the first half.
This streak of scoring provided a nice spark for the Trojans but Enfield emphasized that he wants to find someone he can rely on night in and night out.
“I’d like to come up with some guys that we know we can rely on every night for certain things, whether it’s scoring, rebounding, great defense,” said Enfield. “We’re so streaky at times, it’s hard to do that. We need all of our players to improve and get better.”
Enfield recognized that he has yet to lead his team to a victory over the crosstown rival but he treated it as any other game once again.
“We haven’t beat a lot of teams,” said Enfield. “We’re the fourth youngest team in the nation and it showed tonight,especially at some key points. UCLA is our crosstown rival but there’s other teams we have to beat in this league. Our young players will probably learn a lot from this game.”
USC will get a chance to beat one of those other teams as they next head to Eugene to face another Pac-12 opponent, the Oregon Ducks (12-4, 2-1), next Thursday at 8 p.m.
