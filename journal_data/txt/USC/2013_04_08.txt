The opening was followed by a panel discussion.
The exhibit, which was named “Denouncing Violence Against Women,” featured 18 posters from the Center for the Study of Political Graphics related to the genocides that have occurred in Armenia, the Congo, Guatemala and Rwanda. It also included artistic representations of the recent murders of women in Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.
Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, spoke as a member of the panel regarding the importance of global awareness of genocide, particularly with respect to sexual violence.
“I am very aware as a male in this world that I am the enemy,” Smith said. “Events like this are extremely important because men are not taking their responsibility for sexual violence in the world.”
The posters in the exhibit were chosen by students as part of an art curating course last fall and were divided into four sections: depictions of dehumanization, individuality, trauma and breaking bonds.
Lauren Dodds, one of the student curators and a graduate student in art history, said she focused her collection on trauma because of what she called “its continuing presence in life.”
“It’s this aspect of violence that doesn’t happen in the moment,” Dodds said. “It’s just this lifelong struggle that people are left with.”
Director of the Fisher Museum Selma Holo said while the exhibit highlights genocide around the global, more needs to be done to curtail systematic violence around the globe.
“It’s not over,” Holo said. “I don’t think we’re in a position particularly to prevent it but we certainly can bring our voices to that.”
Art historian and board member for the CSPG Laura Pomerantz gave a brief presentation on contemporary art and the Cambodian genocide, highlighting the work of Cambodian artist Ly Daravuth.
“The memory of the horror does not eliminate the possibility of its repetition,” Pomerantz said to conclude her presentation.
Faye Espiritu, a junior majoring in business administration, said the event inspired mixed emotions.
“The subject itself was hard to take in and it’s not something that a lot of people talk about in depth,” Espiritu said. “We’re women — this is us. I feel like a lot of times when people talk about it it’s like some issue that’s outside of us but it is directly affecting us.”
Linda Wang, a junior majoring in sociology and philosophy, politics and law, said the discussion and exhibit touched upon issues that are important to both genders.
“The art is really contemporary and mass-produced and, as a result, since its not intended for a global audience necessarily, I think it really speaks to the state of gender relations in the world,” Wang said.

The Board of Trustees announced Sunday that Frank J. Fertitta III and Leonard D. Schaeffer were elected as new members.
Combined, Fertitta and Schaeffer have donated more than $50 million to the university. In the form of a leadership gift, the Fertittas’ donation will be put toward the construction of a new undergraduate instructional building. In addition, the donation will lead to the endowment of a faculty chair in the Marshall School of Business. A previous donation from Schaeffer established the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.
Fertitta and Schaeffer are both USC alumni. Fertitta is the chairman and CEO of Station Casinos, one of the largest gaming companies in the United States, and Fertitta Entertainment, a resort and casino developmentand management firm. Fertitta is also a founder and primary owner of Zuffa LLC, which is best known for owning Ultimate Fighting Championship.
“I look forward to his contributions as a member of our Board of Trustees as we strive to instill in our students the critical and entrepreneurial thinking that will enable them to thrive in our globally interconnected world,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement.

Schaeffer has also worked extensively in the private sector. He was the founding chairman and CEO of WellPoint, a large health care company associated with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Schaeffer’s company has been listed as “America’s Most Admired Health Care Company” in Fortune magazine for six years straight, beginning in ‘04.
Schaeffer is one of the primary donors to the Schaeffer Center, which is housed within the Price School of Public Policy and the School of Pharmacy. The center conducts research that is focused on developing and evaluating solutions to control health care costs and improve the experience for patients.
“Leonard D. Schaeffer is a visionary who has revolutionized every institution that he has led over the course of his career,” said Schaeffer Center Associate Director Julie Zissimopoulos.   “The breadth of his experience and the depth of his knowledge has been invaluable to the USC Schaeffer Center, particularly through his service as the chair of the center’s advisory board.”
Both Fertitta and Schaeffer have previously received awards from the university for their contributions to USC in the past.
Schaffer was the 2012 recipient of the Sol Price Award for his accomplishments as a business leader, philanthropist and policy expert. Fertitta was the recipient of the Asa V. Call Alumni Achievement Award for exceptional commitment to the university as an alumnus.
“more white men”
Of course.. who else?
who is the editor?? You messed up the pictures..
You also misspelled Frank Fertitta in the photo descriptor
You mixed up the pictures of Fertettia and Schaeffer.
Spelled wrong too!  
Fertitta
Madisen, call your mom and see if that Starbucks in the Ralph’s is still hiring
Don’t be rude! I’m sure she worked hard on this piece. We shouldn’t castigate the journalist just because one letter was incorrectly added in one name on the sidebar – the actual writing of the article itself is great. Congratulations Madisen on getting published by the DT! Hope to see more articles.
If anything, the question is why the editorial staff did not catch these minor errors.
Yeah! Frank Fertitta is an SC alumnus!!!! If some of the football players don’t get drafted into the NFL, there’s an option. If some of these NFL hopefuls don’t get drafted, they can go under the wing of some of the top MMA teams and use their raw athletic talent to make waves in the UFC. 
UFC and USC, yeah baby!!!!
More White Men?

A draft of the National Climate Assessment Report took center stage Monday in a public comment forum focusing on climate change and its impact on issues ranging from water supplies to rising sea levels.
Focus · Arnold Schwarzenegger urged the importance of recognizing climate change on Monday at the Price School of Public Policy. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The forum, hosted by former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute in partnership with the USC Center for Sustainable Cities, brought together some of the nation’s most prominent scientists and local leaders to discuss the effects of climate change. The forum’s goal was to not only raise awareness about the NCAR, but also to elevate the discussion beyond the paper and into the lives and minds of policymakers, opinion leaders and constituents.
During the opening remarks, Schwarzenegger stressed the importance of listening to the voices of our nation’s experts on the pivotal issue of climate change, likening their diagnosis to the opinions one would receive from a doctor after a yearly physical.
“If we are smart, we listen to our doctors, and if we are stupid, we ignore our doctors and it takes a heart attack to realize that we should listen,” Schwarzenegger said. “The National Climate Assessment Report is our physical and these scientists can give us a prescription for what we need to do to improve our climate. It is our duty to listen to them and encourage action — action all over the country.”
Hilda Blanco, interim director of the Center for Sustainable Cities and professor at the Price School, reached out to the Price School following the release of a draft of the NCAR and asked them to hold a public comment session to draw more attention to the report before the period for public comment expires on April 12.
The panel of experts featured a variety of scientists who discussed the staggering impact of climate change on the Southwestern region of the United States. The primary topics covered included melting sea ice, increasing wildfires, declining water supply, increasing risk of health problems and threats to coastal populations in the form of floods and erosion.
Following a presentation by each scientist, the floor was opened to public comments from a variety of stakeholders who shared their strategies for both adapting to and altering the impacts of climate change. Strategies shared included influencing policymakers, increasing public partcipation, building more energy-efficient homes and better managing of shared resources such as water.
Axel Hellman, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development, said it was inspiring to see important figures in the political and scientific community reach out to the public.
“It was good to see Governor Schwarzenegger speak, and the scientists had very important things to say about getting the public to pay attention to [climate change],” Hellman said. “I’m very glad that this sort of event is happening to address that challenge.”
Pablo Mondal, a doctorate student studying management and organization, said the data presented was powerful motivation for action.
“The more focus you have on the data, the better,” Mondal said. “The most helpful part is when the scientists talk about specific applications, so that the issue seems real.”
Following the event, Schwarzenegger sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to listen to the findings presented at the public forum comment and take action.
“It is more than clear that the science is in, the debate is over and the time for bold action is now,” Schwarzenegger said. “This report is our wake-up call — please consider its message and find a path forward.”
Schwarzenegger will be returning to the university on April 30 to host a bipartisan immigration reform forum.
As a third generation alumnus of the University of Southern California, I’d suggest you all think about where you last saw these words: Faithful, Scholarly, Skilful, Courageous, Ambitious. Then consider this:We are Trojans, not chumps. Given his track record as a human being, the former governor is doing us no honor with his money nor his pontifications. Any Bruin would agree… with me… do you? Now, let’s get back to addressing climate change.
Fight On!
Arnold has learned a lot from Hollywood and his time spent as governor. This was political theater at its best.
ONLY LIMITED EVOLUTION POSSIBLE IN NATURE
All real evolution in nature is within limits. The genes already exist for micro-evolution (variations within a biological kind such as varieties of dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc.), but not for macro-evolution (variations across biological kinds such as from sea sponge to human). The unthinking environment has no ability to design or program entirely new genes. Only variations of already existing genes and traits are possible. A dog will always be a dog no matter how many varieties come into being. 
Evolutionists hope and assume that, over millions of years, random mutations (accidental changes) in the genetic code caused by radiation from the environment will produce entirely new genes for entirely new traits in species for natural selection to use, so that macro-evolution occurs.  It’s much like hoping that, if given enough time, randomly changing the sequence of letters in a cook book will turn the book into a romance novel, or a book on astronomy!
Another problem for macro-evolution is the issue of survival of the fittest. How can a partially evolved species be fit for survival? A partially evolved trait or organ that is not complete and fully functioning from the start will be a liability to a species, not a survival asset. Plants and animals in the process of macro-evolution would be unfit for survival. 
Imagine an evolving fish having part fins and part feet, with the fins evolving into feet. Where’s the survival advantage? It can’t use either fins or feet efficiently. These fish exist only on automobile bumper stickers!
In fact, how could species have survived at all while their vital organs were supposedly evolving? Survival of the fittest (aka natural selection) may explain how species survive, due to minor variations and adaptations to the environment, but not how they originated. Natural selection doesn’t produce biological traits or variations. It can only “select” from biological variations that are possible. The real issue is what biological variations are possible, not natural selection.
Genetic and biological similarities between species are no proof of common ancestry. Such similarities are better and more logically explained due to a common Genetic Engineer or Designer (yes, God) who designed similar functions for similar purposes in various species. Genetic information, like other forms of information, cannot arise by chance, so it’s more rational to believe that DNA or genetic similarities between species are due to intelligent design.
What about “Junk” DNA? The latest science shows that “Junk DNA” isn’t junk after all! It’s we who were ignorant of how useful these segments of DNA really are. Recent scientific research published in scientific journals such as Nature and RNA has revealed that the “non-coding” segments of DNA are essential in regulating gene expression (i.e. how, when, and where genes are expressed in the body).
All the fossils that have been used to support human evolution have ultimately been found to be either hoaxes, non-human, or human, but not human and non-human.
All species in the fossil record and living are complete, fully-formed, and fully functional. There’s no macro-evolution in nature.

*I have given successful lectures (with question and answer period afterwards) defending creation before evolutionist science faculty and students at various colleges and universities. I’ve been privileged to be recognized in the 24th edition of Marquis “Who’s Who in The East” for my writings on religion and science.
Did we see anywhere in the panelists’ discussion of exactly how the regulation of CO2 and the sequestration of it underground promotes any kind of energy usage efficiency, improved resource management, and cleaner energy?
If you think it out, there was acid rain in prehistorical times and no industrial complex to blame. The interjection is contemporary, and prostituted by people like ex-Vice President Al Gore to make money. The instinces of global warming and cooling have littered human history, but it’s the opportunists who have used the notion for financial advantage. There in lies the political and economic substance of this issue.
scientists had very important things to say about getting the public to pay attention to [climate change]
About time that americans start accepting climate change as a global threat.
Hope they stop boycotting any attempt by the rest of the world to prevent climate change
GLOBAL WARMING MAY NOT BE MAN MADE
Dr. Larry Vardiman (scientist and physicist) of the Institue for Creation Research says:
“One possible scenario may be found in a recent series of articles by Henrik Svensmark and Nigel Marsh, cosmic ray specialists from Denmark, who have shown an indirect connection between galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity and global temperature.7,8,9 They are studying the influence of the Sun on the flow of GCR to Earth. The Sun’s changing sunspot activity influences the magnetosphere surrounding the Earth permitting more GCR to strike the Earth during high periods of activity.
When the Sun is active, the intensity of GCR striking the Earth is increased, causing more ionization in the atmosphere, creating more carbon-14, and possibly creating more cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). This increase in CCN, in turn, appears to create more low-level clouds which cool the Earth. When the Sun is quiet the GCR intensity striking the Earth is reduced, allowing the Earth to warm. Svensmark and Marsh have shown a striking statistical correlation between sunspot activity and global cooling and warming over the past 1000 years.
The recent rise in global temperature may partially be due to current low solar activity supplemented by a recent increase in carbon dioxide concentration measured at Mauna Loa. The connection which still needs further study is the production of CCN and clouds by GCR.” 
There is a good deal of science showing that global warming is not mad made. Yes, we still should have pollution controls, as we already do, but not to the extreme because it will unnecessarily hurt business.

Two USC student-athletes have been honored not for their work under the bright lights on gameday, but for their dedication to preparing for the biggest of moments.
Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers and graduated defensive specialist Erin Yoder of the USC men’s and women’s volleyball teams were named All-American Strength and Conditioning Athletes of the Year Monday by the National Strength and Conditioning Association, which recognizes student-athletes with outstanding dedication to strength training and conditioning.
Dedication · Senior defensive specialist Erin Yoder can attribute much of her 18 career service aces to her improved strength and conditioning. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The NSCA, which has been commemorating athletes’ commitment to overall fitness and physical preparation for 34 years, honored 229 collegiate and high school athletes from 98 schools with this award this year.
In just his second year, Feathers has become one of the top middle blockers in the nation. The Pacific Palisades native ranks fifth nationally in hitting percentage (.395) this season and was named the Sports Imports/American Volleyball Coaches Association Division I-II Men’s National Player of the Week on Jan. 15 of this year.
During USC’s run to the NCAA championship match last season, his 1.60 blocking average led the nation and notched a Trojan rally scoring era record with 154 blocks. His feats earned him the honor of being named the 2012 “Off The Block” National Blocker of the Year.
A high school All-American honorable mention, Feathers has made great strides since then in his dexterity and technique.
“Robert came to USC with good strength, but difficulty with control and full range of motion, specifically with lower body movement,” USC assistant strength and conditioning coach Brent Metz told USCTrojans.com. “He is an example of hard work paying off. He spent every day last summer focusing on technique. As a result, he is able to not only lift more weight, but all his movements are more fluid.”
Yoder played 101 matches for USC during her four years on the team. She recorded 11 serviced aces during her senior season, including four against Cal on Oct. 12, a career-best for aces in a single match. She finished her career with 21 service aces and 181 digs, and her performance on and off the court last season was rewarded when she was named a Pac-12 All-Academic honorable mention. She was a member of two USC teams that advanced to the NCAA national semifinals (2010 and 2011).
Yoder’s strength and conditioning improved in multiple areas throughout her career, which led to her increased role with the team as she gained more experience.
“Erin’s ability to understand exactly how to do any movement and then repeat that same performance day in and day out is amazing,” Metz said to USCTrojans.com. “She has dramatically improved in every single lift, agility drill, jump and spring since her freshman year and her attention to detail is a thing of beauty.”
Though Yoder’s career came to a close in December, Feathers is not yet halfway through his Trojan career. Amid a disappointing 2012-13 year, the men’s volleyball team will wrap up its regular season this week, with two games remaining against UC Santa Barbara and UCLA.

You’re going to read a fair number of prepared statements from USC Athletic Director Pat Haden in the next 12 months.
With Frank Cruz’s termination and Michael Cooper’s resignation, Haden will assumedly announce new coaches for baseball and women’s basketball, respectively, at some point. For women’s basketball, it “could be soon,” Haden acknowledged last Wednesday. Perhaps this week?
And depending on how the football team performs in the fall — an outcome steeped in unpredictability based on the past two very different seasons — he could also be announcing another new head coach. Time will tell.
All this, of course, comes on the heels of last week’s hiring of Florida Gulf Coast University’s Andy Enfield as the school’s men’s basketball coach.
Simply put, Haden, now in his third year as the Trojans’ athletic director, faces his chance to overhaul the breadwinner sports — the “Big Four,” if you will.
This is where he’ll leave his mark at USC. What happens over this calendar year will likely shape his legacy. And there’s plenty of pressure to get things right, though he might not easily admit it.
“I don’t feel any pressure,” Haden jokingly quipped following Enfield’s introductory press conference at the Galen Center last week.
But there is pressure because, well, making the right hire carries plenty of benefits.
“I think you always want to make the right hire,” Haden said Wednesday. “If you get it right, not necessarily in football or basketball but, you can have coaches for 10, 20 or 30 years.”
The former Rose Bowl-winning quarterback and Rhodes Scholar took over as USC’s athletic director in August 2010, replacing Mike Garrett, who stepped down in the wake of NCAA-levied sanctions earlier that summer. It no doubt was an embarrassing period for the university, which was cited for an overall “lack of institutional control” of its athletic program.
What followed included four years of probation, a two-year bowl ban for football and scholarship reductions for football and men’s basketball. In addition, the football, men’s basketball and women’s tennis teams all had to vacate dozens of victories.
This was egg on its face. This was a low point.
Tapping Haden, who sat on USC’s Board of Trustees at the time, was crisis management. He didn’t need an introduction. If there was a poster child of a student-athlete, Haden might’ve been it. His resume said it all. From 1987 to 2010, he was a partner and managing director of Riordan, Lewis & Haden, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm. Prior to that, in the mid-1980s, he was an attorney at the Los Angeles office of Lillick, McHose & Charles. He was, to  put it mildly, a smart guy.
Haden’s foremost task included cleaning up the mess of his predecessor and restoring respect to the department. He naturally talked about winning across all varsity sports, but seemingly every statement that followed mentioned doing so ethically and in the “right way,” a not-so-subtle dig at the previous Heritage Hall administration.
To accomplish those basic goals in Garrett’s wake was a tough task, but it’s been done. Haden, with the assistance of Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts, has more than tripled the size of the school’s compliance department, which is tasked with monitoring coaches and student-athletes so that they remain, as the name suggests, in compliance with NCAA rules and regulations.
Under the watch of Haden and then-new President C. L. Max Nikias, the university also retained the services of the Freeh Group to oversee compliance issues and assess the athletic department. They prepared a report to the school with recommendation in the fall of 2010. The group, headed by former FBI director Louis J. Freeh, was also used by Pennsylvania State University in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sexual-abuse scandal last summer.
Not to mention that when it comes to public relations, Haden has handled the situation with great aplomb.
Because of all that, and because of his on-the-field success as a USC quarterback, Haden will always be thought of fondly by many around the athletic department. He’s been dutiful when it comes to his alma mater. He answered the call to serve as athletic director. His place in Trojan lore is safe.
But his ability, or inability, to turn baseball, men’s basketball, women’s basketball and football into perennial contenders on a national level will ultimately become his lasting legacy. Fair or unfair, that’s the expectation many hold.
His ultimate success as AD rests on that.
Quite a number of USC-centric message boards have, over the last year, collectively referred to Haden as “Patient Pat,” a sign of the mounting frustration among a growing segment of the fanbase. They’ve been waiting for Haden to make a slam-dunk hire, and to reinvigorate programs such as men’s basketball, which has enjoyed success over the last decade (see: the Tim Floyd years) but not much sustained success.
Haden gets that chance at a “reset” on the hardwood with Enfield. He’ll get that chance on the diamond, too. Maybe even the gridiron in a year’s time. Who knows?
It won’t be long until we know whether or not Haden’s patience has paid off.

Haden had reasonable cause to fire Lane, but instead chose to  shower him with praise . When one considers all of the issues that Lane created last year both ethically  and coaching wise, it’s hard to have much faith in Haden as an AD who keeps preaching that”we will win the right way.”

Why, you might ask, is USC playing two games at Cal State Fullerton this season, while the Titans only play one at Dedeaux Field? Seems a little unfair to the Trojans, doesn’t it? Why would USC would agree to that?
Well, as it turns out, the reason for the discrepancy is that USC Assistant Coach Gabe Alvarez lost a coin flip with a Fullerton assistant while on a scouting trip in San Diego last winter.
Control issues · Junior Sean Silva is one of the many USC pitchers who have struggled to throw strikes this year, with nine walks in 10.2 innings. –
The game decided by the coin toss was actually the teams’ opener, played back on Feb. 15, but it comes around with bigger effect now, as the Trojans (12-19) travel to Goodwin Field for a second time this year to take on the No. 4 Titans (28-4) tonight at 6 p.m.
Cal State Fullerton has lost just one time in the last calendar month, and by one run at that. The Titans always have a talented squad, but the consensus is that this is its most prolific in recent memory. They started off the season against USC ranked 22nd, climbed to No. 10 by the time the Trojans played them and have now cracked the top five.
“It’s another great team,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said of the Titans. “So we need to be able to have quality at-bats like we did on Saturday and Sunday, but we also need to be able to punch the runs across.”
The Trojans totaled 27 hits in a three-game set against Stanford this weekend, including nine on Saturday and 11 on Sunday, but managed to put just 12 runs across the plate all weekend and dropped the series two games to one.
Still, there is perhaps no stat that describes the Trojans’ struggles this year better than their discrepancy in walks taken compared to walks surrendered. USC has given up 146 free bases this year, twice as much as the 73 they have taken at the plate. Stanford, by comparison, has taken 93 and given up 69. Fullerton has taken an incredible 151 free bases.
“It’s glaring,” Hubbs called the discrepancy. “Offensively, we’re trying to get things done so fast. We’re not allowing the game to come to us. You see the guys who have the most walks on our team — it’s because the game is slower for them at the plate.”
The only players on the Trojan team this year with more than five walks at the plate are junior infielder Kevin Swick, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs and fifth-year senior outfielder Greg Zebrack, all among the most experienced hitters on the team.
“They don’t have any fear of taking a pitch and waiting for the right one,” Hubbs said of his upperclassmen. “And they’re capable of fouling pitches off and waiting for the one to hit and putting that one in play. Our young guys, when they go up to the plate they don’t want to get deep into counts.”
But the discrepancy is more than just about the youthful hitters. One hundred and forty-six is an inordinate amount of walks to give up, and the struggles on the mound can be traced back to youth as well.
“We’re asking some of these guys to be juniors as freshman,” Hubbs said. “So they’re getting a lot of experience, but it’s unfair to them. A lot of them still have a ways to go. Because we’re a youthful team, we don’t have the depth in experience.”
Indeed, the only two upperclassman to start even one game for the Trojans this year are juniors Bob Wheatley (who has started seven) and Sean Silva, a junior college transfer who made his first start last Friday after Wheatley was scratched. The Trojans have started freshman in close to half (14 of 31) of their games so far this year, with underclassman comprising 23 of the 31 starts.
And it will be yet another freshman to start tonight for USC, as Sean Adler will get the ball against the Titans. If there was ever a time for a freshman to pitch like a junior, it would be on the road against the No. 4 team in the country.

Members of the No. 6-ranked women’s rowing team arrived in San Diego for the 40th annual San Diego Crew Classic expecting nothing short of a victory in an event that USC has dominated in recent years.
A stroke above the rest · The USC women’s rowing team has thrived at the San Diego Crew Classic in recent years, and this year was no different, with the team taking home an unprecedented three trophies. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information
They accomplished just that, taking home the coveted Jessop-Whittier Cup for an unprecedented third consecutive year.
The team also claimed grand final victories to win both the Jackie Ann Stitt Hungness Trophy and the Karen Plumleigh Cortney Cup in what was truly a memorable day.
“Awesome. That was really awesome,” USC head coach Zenon Babraj told USCTrojans.com. “I think they all rose to the occasion. It was a great day, but we’ve got to still keep in mind that it’s San Diego and just the beginning of the season.”
Sunday’s victory marked just the second time in school history that USC has taken home three trophies from the prestigious West Coast regatta and the first time that the school has won in three varsity collegiate divisions.
The Women of Troy began the day in peak form when they claimed the Jessop-Whittier cup for the fifth time in school history. The team was able to fend off some of the top crews in the nation to win the top prize, including No. 1 Virginia and No. 2 California. Also in the field were No. 7 Washington, No. 9 UCLA and unranked Duke.
Virginia bolted out front as the race began and gained a considerable early lead. Both Cal and UCLA also held leads during the first half of the 2,000-meter race, with USC and Washington jockeying for fourth.
But the Cavaliers faded around the midway point, and USC was able to surpass them. With about 750 meters left, the Women of Troy made their move to catch Cal and UCLA, who were still ahead.
The team’s great surge came with only 250 meters left and, under the call of senior coxswain Jennah Blau, USC coasted to victory three seconds ahead of Cal with a top time of 6:25.30. Virginia took third place, followed by UCLA, Washington and Duke.
“We always talk about how we want to run our own race,” Blau told USCTrojans.com. “We knew that Virginia was going to come out fast. They took a lot of 10s and made a lot of moves directly after their start and we knew that that wasn’t something we wanted to match, so we focused on running our own race.”
In the second division, USC earned its second trophy of the day: the Jackie Ann Stitt Hungness Trophy. USC finished with a time of 6:32.41, more than five seconds faster than Cal’s second place time. It was the first time the school had won the trophy since 2007.
To finish off the already-successful day, the varsity four boat claimed the second Karen Plumleigh Corney Cup in USC history, with a winning time of 7:23.87, nearly three seconds faster than second place UCLA.
USC’s novice division team finished fourth in a petite final for the Laurel V. Korholz Perpetual Trophy with a time of 7:05.62. Texas’ A team claimed the top spot, followed by Washington State and Texas’ B team.
With the majority of the schedule still ahead of the team, there is much work to be done. But this is certainly the kind of start to the season Babraj had hoped for, and the team can only hope to match this high level of production moving forward.
USC’s next race will take place at the Lake Natoma Invitational in Gold River, Calif., on April 20.

With Sony’s PlayStation 4 having already been announced and news on Microsoft’s new Xbox expected to come soon, developers are preparing their next big games to launch with the new generation of consoles.
Not wanting to forget about their current consoles, however, both Sony and Microsoft decided to leave fans with prequels to two of the biggest franchises for their respective platforms: Sony’s God of War and Microsoft’s Gears of War.
The two games, God of War: Ascension and Gears of War: Judgment, introduce the stories of each console’s bloodiest franchise, with each game providing the same violent, gore-filled experience of previous games while tweaking pieces of the formula.
“In terms of next-gen, I think the release timeline makes sense because this will allow both studios to potentially have a next-gen title out during the second holiday season, which, if previous history is an indicator, usually has substantially better titles than  during the launch window,” said USC engineering lecturer and former games programer Sanjay Madhav. “Most launch titles on the PS3 and Xbox 360 were ports of games that were also released on PS2/Xbox.”
God of War: Ascension, the seventh game in Sony’s action-adventure series, features protagonist Kratos. After Ares kills the man’s wife and child, Kratos renounces his blood oath to the god of war, only to be held captive by the three Furies.
The game takes you up to the original, as Kratos tries to kill the three Furies and free himself from captivity. The story, which doesn’t take long to complete, is told through flashback sequences going back to before he was imprisoned. It starts off with an extremely impressive and drawn-out boss battle, with many later bosses continuing the epic formula that God of War has become respected for.
The action has been adjusted to require more skill than usual, but remains as brutal and intense as past games in the series. The rage meter from past games returns, increasing as Kratos deals more damage, but now decreases if Kratos stays out of combat for too long or gets hit.
Filling up the meter allows for more powerful attacks and combos, while elemental attacks, such as fire, ice and electricity, provide the magic variation in the game.
While these adjustments do allow for more complex and action-packed combat, it is still easy enough to merely hack-and-slash one’s way through the fights, as most enemy attacks deal very little damage to Kratos, even on the normal difficulty level. It is also relatively easy to build up the rage meter after being hit by an enemy, as long as there are enough enemies left to slaughter.
There are some issues with the game play, but the magic system has been nicely improved. The magic can be used as a spell, an enhanced attack that doesn’t take up any magic, or as a rage attack, providing more variety than present in past games.
Unfortunately, the camera, though mostly capable of providing the right angles for combat, sometimes chooses questionable angles. The puzzles also often underwhelm as they generally prove to be mere hiccups on the player’s way through the game, an exception being a couple of especially challenging (and frustrating) ones.
God of War’s violent action makes its debut in the multiplayer environment, as players can align with one of the four available gods (character classes) and compete against bots and human opponents. There are plenty of abilities, armor, weapons and items to unlock by gaining experience for each class, whether it’s killing enemies, capturing points or opening chests. In a world where first-person shooters dominate online play, Ascension provides an entertaining and violent break from the norm. There is a learning curve, however, that comes with playing a game like this against human opponents, and that learning curve can get unnecessarily steeper if one gets thrown into games against high-leveled opponents with stronger equipment.
“I think from a financial standpoint, multiplayer makes sense because it may convert those who may not get a single-player-only game,” said Madhav about the inclusion of multiplayer.
Gears of War: Judgment centers around series staples Baird and Kilo Squad, as they stand trial for treason. The campaign starts out at the beginning of the trial, and the story is told through flashbacks, as one plays through the events leading up to the trial. The game, developed by Epic Games and People Can Fly, makes a couple of tweaks to the Gears of War experience, but doesn’t make any major gameplay changes.
The big new addition to the campaign, known as “Declassified Missions,” allows the player to go through each campaign mission with an additional requirement, such as reduced ammo supply or reaching a certain area within a time limit. These can be easily accessed at the start of each mission to provide greater difficulty and increased rewards, although players are free to simply breeze through the campaign if that’s what they prefer.
The Horde game mode introduced in Gears of War 2 also undergoes some changes in the new game. The new mode, called Overrun, has the player and a group of either computer- or human-controlled teammates defending an area from Locust attacks, which can also be computer- or human-controlled. The defending soldiers are free to switch between four character classes — soldier, scout, engineer and medic — depending on the situation, while those playing as the Locust can unlock more powerful aliens as they deal more damage. Though it does switch the focus of the mode from that of merely survival to defending a specific area, Overrun does provide a great alternative to the usual Horde mode.
Multiplayer in Judgment is standard for the Gears series, with one major aspect missing: executions. Though this allows free-for-all to make its debut in the series, being able to curb stomp an opposing player or use their downed body as a meat-shield was something that had become a staple in Gears so, though it does provide more options, it is something that fans of the series will miss.
Overall, both God of War: Ascension and Gears of War: Judgment provide another enjoyable entry in their respective franchises. For fans of either series, these prequels are definitely worth adding to their collections, shedding light on the roots of each series. The introduction of multiplayer to God of War, though seeming like a feature being forced upon games by the industry, provides an enjoyable alternative to the plethora of online first-person shooters available, even if it might not be for everyone.
Both offer great, albeit short, campaigns and, while neither multiplayer experience is likely to achieve the kind of following games like Halo and Call of Duty have, they can serve as fun diversions and will be able to tide fans over until the next-gen versions of these iconic series get released.

Everyone was waiting for it, counting down the days until April 7 arrived. Holding their breaths, biting their nails, hearts pounding in anticipation.
The Mad Men season six premiere.
It seemed like you couldn’t sign on to a news feed or walk into a coffee shop without hearing someone moaning and crying over how badly they wanted the new season to arrive. Granted, no other show has really permeated pop culture in such an original way, yet I’ve never really seen the allure of the show aside from one thing: its fashion.
So slow-burning dramas about life as ad men in the ’50s and ’60s aren’t really my thing. But I can definitely appreciate a great cinched waist and a beautifully tailored tux. The fashion of the show is so celebrated that its designer routinely has had a Mad Men-themed collection in Banana Republic for the past two spring seasons as well as a fall season.
Open up any fashion magazine this week and you’ll see what’s “hot for spring.” It’s all about mod, black and white, ’60s-influenced frocks and pants. For men, it’s all about the tailored suit, even in the summer. Large glasses, pocket squares and skinny ties are in. Short-shorts, crop tops and baggy pants are out the window.
And while Fashion Week is a great time for designers to show what’s new for next season, the truth is that everything that’s “new” is actually probably several decades old. Trends certainly repeat themselves — which is why I was thankful that the clog fad quickly died out.
Each decade has its own style and its own defining characteristics. The style dynamic ’50s and ’60s, however, have remained timeless throughout the decades. The truth is, you can never go wrong with a classic style and cut. Flared out jeans from the ’70s? I guess they can look good if you pair them well with some cute wedges and a tucked in shirt. Tight black shirt with a hoop-like skirt? You’ll always knock it out of the park — guaranteed.
So hop on the bandwagon. Embrace the aesthetic because honestly, it’ll never go out of style. Mark my words: One hundred years from now, people will still be wearing red lipstick.
Need a little guidance? Look to the characters from Mad Men for a little help.
Ginger Bombshell / Glamour Girl / wallflower
Christina Hendricks plays Joan, a sexy and smart employee at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Her signature is her walk — with a slight wiggle of her derriere she can command the attention of a room.
Hendricks claims that her walk is because of the specially made undergarments the actors use on the show. With girdles, one can cinch in the waist and create a shape that anyone would lust after. On top, go for jewel-drenched satin dresses that show off everything that your mama gave you.
Betty (January Jones) and Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) are polar opposites. One basically spends her days in beautiful ballgowns while the other rocks an unfortunate set of bangs. No matter which character you identify with, there’s a way to make it work.
If you want to glam it up like Betty, it’s all about shape and material: cinched-in waists with cascading trains, perfectly done makeup and impeccable hair. And Betty isn’t afraid of some bling — look for sequined accents and large necklaces.
If Peggy is more your girl, then go with the super current Peter Pan collar trend that’s been hitting up the runways recently. But beware: Though it’s polished and in-season, if you’re too busty it can create an unflattering shape for your body.
Mr. Draper Himself
Men, it’s all about the fit. No matter how expensive your clothes are, if they are too baggy or too loose, it doesn’t matter. All boys should have a pair of perfectly fitting jeans and slacks — that way you will never be in doubt.
Jon Hamm’s Don Draper might always be in a suit, but you can apply his polished style to your everyday life. Stop with the messy look or what you think are funny graphic T-shirts. Invest in a wardrobe that offers a wide color palette and can be matched with anything.
In terms of a suit, you don’t have to head to Alfred Dunhill to feel like Mr. Draper. The fashion district has plenty of cheap tailoring shops, which sell quality suits for a fraction of the cost. Plus, with a little haggling, you can get yourself a nice discount.
Skinny and bow ties are in, so have a few to cycle throughout the week. And now that you’re starting to apply for internships and jobs, learning to look your best is key.
For Mad Men devotees (or those who just want to look like one) who are having trouble finding some retro items, just look to Banana Republic’s Mad Men collection. The importance of this trend is finding small retro pieces to pair with more modern-day ones. Pair a crisp dress shirt with a skinny tie and a solid hoodie. Rock a classic suit with some Chucks. Make it your own.

It’s not just the 60’s dress but we’re seeing it in the hairstyles and the make up as well. My friend watches Mad Men, mostly because of the dialogue, but the style of the show has definitely influenced style once again.
“So hop on the bandwagon”
Clearly, the DT has reached new heights of critical thinking.
The irony is that Ms. Watson majors in critical studies.  
“All boys should have a pair of perfectly fitting jeans and slacks — that way you will never be in doubt.”
Is this really what they teach in the critical studies department?

From the start, the two-hour season premiere of Mad Men on Sunday establishes an ominous mood, as Don Draper quotes from Dante’s Inferno.

“Midway in our life’s journey, I went astray from the straight road, and woke up to find myself in a dark wood,” Don reads, setting the scene for the dark mood the episode carries,  unprecedented to previous season-openers. Because of this, instead of promising a sense of renewal, “The Doorway” seems to reflect a continuous internal melancholy within the show’s characters — especially Don.
Perhaps Lane Pryce’s suicide last season is one of the reasons that anxious thoughts about death seem to underline Sunday night’s episode.
Death predominantly affected Don’s behavior throughout the episode, as his demeanor was disturbingly removed and unfocused. He seemed to be more interested in reading Inferno than in enjoying his luxurious expenses-paid Hawaiian vacation.  Don’s compulsiveness about death might hopefully resolve the series’ fundamental question — Who is Don Draper?
One of the salient narrative techniques in “The Doorway” is that it is not designed to look like a season opener. Rather, it is a continuation. A possible lack of a concrete narrative might be a primary reason why some viewers find Mad Men a challenging experience. Though Weiner’s plot structures might articulate as puzzling, they nonetheless, translate into an hour of beautiful television.
For Mad Men to explain its details, such as an exact year, would significantly detract from its intoxicating experience. Ambiguity of an exact year became a major narrative approach in the fifth season, only to be revealed in subtle dialogue or visual indicators (the fifth season left off in spring 1967, as Don paid a visit to the cinema to watch Casino Royale). Viewing Mad Men is learning how to sharply train your eye to pick up details. “The Doorway” clearly was an example of this narrative tactic.
“The Doorway” was loaded with from past seasons iconography. Outrageous fashions of the late ’60s and the addition of a staircase leading to the newly constructed second floor at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce comprised minor details of the episode. Instead of investigating possible new meanings to these striking images, recycling of previous seasons’ symbols was of higher significance.
Finely pressed suits, cigarettes and Don’s Old Fashioned provide hints at character development. Don’s indulgences with his signature cocktail and handy cigarette were crucial in revealing his affair with his neighbor, breaking fidelity with Megan.
A slimmer Betty continued donning her brown-tweed suit and Hermes scarf, still indicating discomfort with her figure. Betty’s unexpected decision to dye her blonde locks darker might further encourage her to shed the extra weight.
The most sentimental re-use of earlier props was the use of the Kodak Carousel. At the Drapers’ New Year’s Eve party, Megan showed guests pictures of their luxurious Hawaiian vacation using the slide projector. The Kodak Carousel was pitched in the Mad Men’s first season finale, when Don poignantly immortalized, “In Greek, nostalgia literally means ‘the pain from an old wound.’”
Absent-mindedness, frequent death haunts, binge drinking and smoking contributed to Don’s obvious dissatisfaction with his current life and marriage. As Don exits the honeymoon phase, viewers are left conjecturing whether Don will revisit his old philandering habits.
Similar to some other Mad Men episodes, “The Doorway” could be burdensome because of its slowly paced narrative and tendency to assimilate multiple plotlines within an episode. Nonetheless, the episode successfully reclaimed focus of its primary characters: Don, Betty, Peggy and Roger. “The Doorway” splits time between them, all recomposed with new attitudes.
It is gratifying to see Peggy succeed as copy chief at her new agency, especially when handling a potential crisis with a client. Peggy’s copywriting talent and intelligent problem-solving skills confirm her to be a true Don Draper protege. But Peggy’s creative director enthusiastically commends her ethic — a contrast to Don’s habitual indifference toward her achievements.
Roger functioned as the comedic relief among the other characters. But sharing time between his mother’s funeral and a visit to his psychiatrist, Roger was part of a darker narrative as he refused to acknowledge the seriousness of his health problems.
Regardless of the show’s outcome, Mad Men is one of television’s best shows. Much critical acclaim is indebted to the confidence of Weiner’s writing team and their capability to enhance their product on a yearly basis. And Mad Men has become a high-water mark on Sunday night television and pop culture at large, allowing its writers to divulge in deeper and more cryptic situations.
Much of the show’s richness depends on its openness for various interpretations, as it uses a significant decade of American history as milieu.
As the episode ends on New Year’s Day 1968, a major unanswered question has been whether the series will end within the decade.
Costumes, however, might hold clues, as they act as primary indicators that designate time. Several male characters have ridiculous beards and moustaches, while the women don tighter and brighter fashions.
Weiner and his writing team are well-aware of the anticipation  that many viewers hold and this tactic might come into play as an underlying tease throughout the season, as the show changes to fit the transition into a new decade — the seventies.

Theater giant Anton Chekov once wrote, “One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.” This rule, affectionately known as Chekov’s Gun, is the fundamental instruction regarding theatrical foreshadowing.
If only Chekov had included a few addendums to the rule, such as make sure the gun’s presence actually makes sense, is necessary and isn’t dumb.

Alabama Baggage, a play by Buddy Farmer that’s making its world premiere at Theatre Asylum on Santa Monica Boulevard, follows the gospel of Chekov’s Gun. There is a gun, and it is fired. A lot. But considering the gun only distracts from the relatability of the performance, should the gun even be present at all?
The plot of Farmer’s piece should be compelling enough: A model citizen of a small town in Kentucky is exposed as a child molester after his death, but two of his former victims discover that he is still alive and struggle with how to exact their revenge. There’s a laundry list of juicy topics to work with here: the South, small-town politics, faking one’s own death, blackmail, racial tension and child abuse. These are the kinds of themes that should win people Tony awards. So why does this play end up falling flat?
The first problem seems to be with Farmer’s script. Though the premise of the story looks pretty good on paper, his follow-through is disappointing. Instead of creating believable three-dimensional characters who deal with their emotions in tense, visceral moments, the confrontations end up playing out like scenes from an after-school special.
For example, the character of Ben, a black cop who was a victim of molestation, is entirely wholesome throughout the play and never displays any hints of darkness or capacity for change. Ben might be a model citizen in the real world, but on stage, he’s bland and tough to relate to.
The same goes for the molester’s widow, Miss Helen. Aside from the fact that she has very little dialogue, her character has no opportunities to be dynamic. And as the play’s only female character, some shady implications pop up regarding the role of mothers in child abuse cases.
The script could have been saved by the presence of skilled actors, but unfortunately, those are scarce in this production. Will Blagrove delivers a few jokes that earned some laughs from the audience, but overall he struggles to make his character consistently stimulating. William Jones’ Judge Bailey is highly intriguing, but he was only on stage for approximately eight minutes. Ashley McGee, in his interpretation of Lucas, clearly meant to embody a kind-hearted Average Joe-type, but his painfully slow lines made for more of a pitiable country hick than a sympathetic everyman.
This combination of an underdeveloped script and misguided acting proved lethal. In the program’s playwright bio, it is made clear that Farmer has a heavy personal stake in the play’s subject matter.
Incidentally, even though it’s obvious that Farmer and the rest of the creative team had the best of intentions, the low quality of this production resulted in a tone that wasn’t nearly serious enough for hugely controversial topics such as child molestation.
That being said, there may be some hope for possible future reincarnations of Alabama Baggage. This production wasn’t completely devoid of assets.
In the pre-show speech, for instance, the stage manager asks that audience members “silence all cell phones, harmonicas and cowbells” during the show. Maybe if the script incorporated more Southern flavor like this (while of course being careful not to get overly corny), the audience would be able to better enjoy the rich setting.
Similarly, as mentioned above, the character of Judge Bailey holds so much untapped potential; if Farmer could include the judge in more scenes and give him loads more fiery dialogue, Jones’ energetic performance could alter the action’s flow for the better.
In fact, expanding the central conflict to more directly include additional, quicker conversations between several characters could do wonders for the show’s dragging pace, lifting the burden from the two main characters.
Instead, the fundamental flaw to this play is that the tension jumps much too quickly and rarely for the right reasons. From the moment Ben walks out in his police uniform complete with pistol holster, it’s clear that things are about to get real dramatic. But in dealing with issues as colossal as child abuse and racism, perhaps it would be best to tell a story that relies less on guns and faking deaths and instead placed these problems in a more realistic, lower-octane context.
Alabama Baggage has much room for growth. Hopefully, with the help of a few modifications, this play can someday realize its capacity to resonate with audiences. Baggage this heavy deserves to be packed a little more carefully.

Starting in September 2013, schools in the Gaza Strip will join many of their Middle Eastern neighbors by requiring that boys and girls work separately in schools after age nine. The policy comes as part of new regulations imposed by Hamas, the Islamist governing party that has controlled Gaza since 2007.
Some proponents of the new law, such as the education ministry’s legal adviser Waleed Mezher, say that it coincides with traditionalist Palestinian values. Others who are against the new restrictions, however, argue that Hamas worked alone in legislating the policy. The party is using its own agenda to “impose its values on Gaza residents,” said to Zeinab Al-Ghoneimi, a women’s right activist in Gaza to the Huffington Post.
“Instead of hiding behind traditions, why don’t they say clearly they are Islamists and they want to Islamise the community,” Al-Ghoneimi said.
And while the education ministry’s legal advisor denies trying to enforce Islam but rather argues that Hamas is “[honoring] the traditions and culture of the society,” it appears that, in this case, they are one in the same.
Unfortunately, Hamas decided to pass this law without consulting any of the other Palestinian representatives. With all the laws imposed by Hamas since they took power in ’07, Palestinian society is being “[taken] back to ancient times when there was no respect for women’s rights and women were eliminated from public life,” said the Center for Women’s Legal Research and Consulting, the only legal aid group for women in Gaza, according to Yahoo! News.
Regardless of differences between Western and Middle Eastern cultures, no country in the 21st century should have laws that segregate women from men. Beyond segregation in schools, women are forced to cover up in long robes and headscarves, are forbidden from smoking water pipes publically, cannot ride on the back of motorcycles and cannot get their hair done by male stylists — all blurring the lines between church and state.
Back in the 1600s, when theocracy became a huge problem, rebels such as Roger Williams demanded a separation of church and state. How different is this modern-day scenario, in which Hamas is creating laws based off of Islamic ideals? Not only is Gaza pushing itself back decades by revoking women’s rights, but it is also setting itself back decades by maintaining its own form of theocracy.
These new laws are to be enforced not only in public schools, but private schools as well, including the Christian private schools in Gaza. Saying it’s best for a Christian private school to follow traditional Islamic customs is an example of religious persecution, and the increasingly Islamatized Gaza state is only setting itself back socially with such policies.
Ignoring the fact that Hamas is becoming increasingly violent, the fact the group is they are gaining more control and removing the rights of more Palestinians shows that a push toward Palestinian sovereignty, an end to the tensions with Israel and better relations with the rest of the world are far from imminent.
Soon, people are going to find it more and more difficult to live peacefully with this forceful government. When a government continually fails to represent what the majority stands for, then it is impossible to say that they are doing what’s best for the community.
Though Hamas believes that its decision reflects that of the people, its push towards dictatorship says otherwise.
 
Morgan Greenwald is a freshman majoring in neuroscience.
This article is problematic for a few reasons.
Firstly, the writer presents a confusing argument about the relationship between religion and culture in Gaza. It appears that Ms. Greenwald has falsely dichotomized the two. Furthermore, she has privileged culture over religion: what is problematic to her is that laws in Gaza are made by appealing to Islam, not by appealing to culture. This presumption is problematic because it reflects an intense anti-religious sentiment, pervasive in the discourse of this country.
Next it becomes apparent that Ms. Greenwald does not fully understand many of the terms she uses: “theocracy,” “separation of church and state,” and “Islamatized [sic.],” to name a few.  
Ms. Greenwald says, “Regardless of differences between Western and Middle Eastern cultures, no country in the 21st century should have laws that segregate women from men.” What is ironic about this sentence is that the purported universal value (i.e. women should not be segregated from men) is in fact culturally specific one, of the West. Ms. Greenwald wants to impose her cultural values onto the people of Gaza under the guise of a universal principle. Clearly, the principle isn’t universal if there are so many people around the world who would disagree. On what basis, then, is Ms. Greenwald arguing that segregation of genders should be prohibited–their values or her values? 
The argument could be convincingly made in the US that segregation of genders should be prohibited based on our specific cultural values, but do export these values and impose them in the false name of a universal value is abhorrent. It is not Hamas which is imposing laws and values, but rather Ms. Greenwald.
Lastly, Ms. Greenwald has falsely idealized the “separation of church and state.” So what if laws are based on values that are religiously sanctioned? Why should culturally sanctioned values be more legitimate than religiously sanctioned ones? Ms. Greenwald talks about the Christians in Gaza (who, by the way, are less than 1% of the population), saying that it is unfair to impose the Islamically-coloured law onto the Christians. This might be true, but what happens if I am a cultural dissenter–should I also have a right to be exempt from culturally-coloured laws? The problem is that religion, to Ms. Greenwald, is necessarily the enemy–any hint of religion in the public sphere, for her, is grounds for illegitimacy.
Is this an issue? 
The USA has NON MUSLIM single gender classes at secondary schools across the country; some of these people sound Islamphobic.
In the 2011-2012 school year, at least 506 public schools in the United States offered single-sex educational opportunities.
Not to mention single gender colleges in the USA; go protest them. GET A LIFE.
Doug –
Are you married?  Does your wife use birth control pills?
If she does,  you are FORCING STERILAZATION.  Please report at once to the nearest police station.
It is a major conflict of interest for someone so pro-Israel to be writing an article like this. Don’t speak about cultures you know nothing about.
Anonymous – But can you speak about cultures you know nothing about too?  Or is this order just limited to Jews?  Why don’t you expand on your command and tell us why you feel this way?  Would this mean an end to the field of sociology in your humble opinion?
Arafat, save yourself some embarrassment! I don’t always read articles on DT, but I have happened to notice that you are a war monger who constantly spews hate about Palestine and Islam on here. No one here takes you and your one sided b.s. stories seriously. Get a life.
ISRAELI EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS GROUPS EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN SEPARATELY, JUST LIKE THE MUSLIMS. BOYS AND GIRLS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MIX.- This is a fact. 
Oh, these Israeli extremists account for 25% of the population of Israel. Oh, and these extremist do not have to work, they simply collect welfare while they patrol their illegal settlements wreaking terror upon their muslim neighbors by burning them out of their fields and homes. All under the watchful eyes of the Israeli government.
Jay – Your insinuations and exaggerations do nothing to further the discussion.  Yours are like the words of an angry eight-year-old child not those of a college student.  You should probably calm down and take a nap if you are unable to discuss this as an adult.
25%? Cite your sources, otherwise you can’t expect to be taken seriously. You can’t compare the policies of closed communities to those of the government in Gaza. It is a choice to be a member of the former and mandatory to obey the laws of the latter.
IF YOU ADVOCATE A BOYCOTT OF ISRAELI PRODUCTS, IN ISRAEL, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED. IT IS FORBIDDEN. This is a fact.
ANYTHING YOU SEE ON ISRAELI TELEVISION, HEAR ON THE RADIO, READ IN AN ISRAELI NEWSPAPER HAS TO PASS BY THE OFFICIAL ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CENSOR FIRST. This is a fact.
IS ISRAEL A DEMOCRACY OR A FASCIST STATE? IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A DEMOCRACY. 
You have more than enough internal problems Israel without throwing stones at your neighbors.
cale – you and Jay must have been separated at birth.
Israel just held an election a month ago.  Muslims won seats in Israel’s parliament.  Liberals won seats too as did conservatives.  It took the rival factions two weeks to form coalitions such that they could govern the nations and this required give-and-take on all sides.  Sounds like a democracy at work to me, no?
In SHAPR contrast to this the head of Fatah (Abbas) canceled future elections and he did this in 2009.  Since then he has ruled Fatah pretty much as an unelected official, and pretty much as a dictator.
Cale, you sure you have your head screwed on right?
ISRAEL FORCES STERILIZATION OF INCOMING ETHOPIAN/SUDANESE IMMIGRANTS–fact.
WOW, what a democracy.
What does this article have to do with Israel and its democracy? At all?
If you don’t see anti-Palestine and Islamophobic undertones in this piece you are blind.
This is a lie, Doug.  Goebbles would be proud of you.
This is all on Israel.
Gaza would not be in the hands of Hamas if Israel had not completely destroyed the lives of those living in Gaza to the point where they had to choose a terrorist organization over a legit government just to get food and medicine.
Don’t back away from your baby Israelis, Gaza is all yours. For that matter so the the entire Middle East as the US has allowed Israel to write our M.E. policy for the last 50 years–getting us to this point of utter human disgrace that is the policy  of Israel towards it neighbors.
Dee – Do you also blame all of this on Israel too?
…….
The official media narrative is that these differences are the results of eons of oppression,
checkpoints and blockades. Fair enough. But then why does the IMF put Israel’s
GDP Per Capita well ahead of the oil rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia?
Saudi Arabia has no Israeli checkpoints, no Israeli soldiers or planes flying
overhead. It has wealth literally pouring out of the ground with a fifth of the
world’s petroleum reserves. And yet the IMF puts it 13 places behind Israel and
the World Bank puts it 8 places behind Israel. The only Muslim countries with a
better GDP Per Capita rating than Israel are small monarchies drowning in oil. 
The non-oil Muslim countries who are closest to Israel are Malaysia and
Lebanon, 32 and 33 places behind Israel. Both countries also have sizable
non-Muslim populations. Muslims make up only 50 percent of Lebanon and only 60
percent of Malaysia. 
38 places below Israel is Turkey, which until recently was a secular country
and actually has a statistically significant atheist population. And that’s it.
Below that we fall off a cliff into places like Belarus, South Africa and
Grenada; all of whom still have better GDP Per Capita rates. No Muslim country
without oil has a better GDP Per Capita than a Muslim country that has sizable
Christian or Buddhist minorities.
Dee would have you believe all of Islam’s problems are not of Islam’s doing but are someone else’s fault.  
She would have us believe the simmering war in southern Thailand – a war in which 5,000 Buddhists have been killed in cold blood by Islamists – is not Islam’s inherently aggressive doing.
Whe would have us believe that the current mas refugee problem and gang-rape problem in Mali is not of Islma’s doing, but I suppose it is the fault of the French in her twisted mind.
She would have us believe that the thorough ethnic cleansing in Pakistan – a country once home to tens of millions of Hindus, and now almost “Hindu-free” – is not Islam’s doing but someone else’s fault.
She would have us believe that the genocide of Armenian Christians in Turkey in 1915 or the genocide of Hindus in Bangaldesh in 1971 or the genocide of Sudanese Animists in the 1990s was not Islam’s fault even though Muslims committed the crimes.
Dee, it is clear you will rationalize anything to save Muslims from being found guilty of committing crimes against humanity.  It is clear that even though Muslims pull the triggers, gang-rape the women, force the villagers into refugees camps, you excuse them their barbarity and blame some other people (Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists or imperialists or colonialists) instead.
I find that amazing.  Even though in the past week Muslims killed 15 people and wounded 53 yesterday in Damascus dod everyone know they’re not guilty of this crime?
Even though yesterday in Wardak Afghanistan Muslims killed  9 people and injured 22 others that the persons who committed the crime were mere puppets doing something they had not control over doing and it was really America’s fault these Muslims killed fellow Muslims.  
You understand.  Muslims are never guilty.  At least this is so in Dee’s twisted view of reality.
Buses in Israel are seperate, Palestinians cannot ride with Jews.
This is not due to anything cultural it is simple aparteid, Israeli style.
There are 8 million Israeli Arabs/Jews, Christians, Druze etc who can ride around safely in unsegregated buses/trains.  However “mehadrin” bus lines mostly run in and/or between cities where rigid religious rules observed by some ultra-Orthodox Jews are applied. In January 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that gender segregation was unlawful and abolished the “mehadrin” public buses, but some do still exist.
In the West Bank many Jews do not feel safe in buses together with their Arab neighbours.  For that you can thank the Arab suicide bombers who unfortunately took both their lives and those of innocent passengers.

Amy Hsieh | Daily Trojan
When kids in the modern day want to kick back with their favorite television show after a long, hard day’s work, very few turn on their actual television sets.
With the advent of Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go and dozens of other streaming sites, as well as the handy DVR and TiVo recording devices, the idea of sitting through commercials at a specific time each night to watch your favorite show is an outdated concept. It appears that modern adults no longer have the patience nor the flexibility to consume traditional primetime television, and the shift can be felt in the community in more ways than one.
Last week, a divided federal appeals court decided in a 2-1 ruling to decline blocking a subscription service that enables the streaming of broadcast television to any Internet-enabled device, a move establishing that the streaming of television, videos and other media is a trend that is here to stay.
Some companies, such as Netflix and Hulu, have already adapted to this shift in the television landscape, and other companies should follow suit if they want to compete.
In February, Netflix released its original series House of Cards, a decision that allows the company to avoid expensive licensing fees and become more popular.
“Netflix — long known for its movie offerings — is now trying to change the way you watch television,” says journalist Willa Paskin from WBUR.
House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, has become wildly popular, and Netflix plans to develop another sci-fi television show in the months to come. In addition, Netflix will exclusively release the upcoming season of Arrested Development to eagerly waiting fans this summer. For Netflix, the results have exceeded all expectations.
“Even though its availability is restricted to Netflix users, the series has experienced huge success, marking what will take off as a trend in television if marketers have any shred of sense,” said Laura Scherb in The Tartan.
The move allows viewers to consume the show in whichever manner that they want by offering all the episodes in a television season at once, instead of distributing them weekly, as traditional programming does. This move, while intensely scrutinized by experts in the television industry, is in reality a tactical success. Netflix can build their brand as a company catering to the needs of their consumers, and that alone will set off a trend.
In fact, the success of the “Netflix model” has already prompted competitors, such as Amazon and Microsoft, to begin preparing for their own investments in original programming.
“Netflix executives believed, all along, that their loyal customer base was the company’s ace in the hole,” wrote John Friedman of the Fiscal Times. “Its core of most enthusiastic subscribers, who love Netflix’s streaming and DVD-rental offerings, believe the company has made people’s lives easier and deserves a lot of credit for coming up with a better way for people to enjoy movies and television programs at home.”
This strategy of catering to the comfort and convenience of the consumer is an example of an ever-changing industry — and it just might be the future of entertainment.
“It’s predicted that over 50 percent of U.S. Internet users will be watching television online by 2014,” said columnist Shawn Amos in the Huffington Post. “Right now, 5 million people say they’ve ditched pay TV in favor of Internet streaming.”
Television companies would be wise to capitalize on this shift while they can because as with any changing industry, time is of the essence.
“Can pay TV dig its heels in and try to hold off the future?” Amos asked. “Just ask someone in the record industry how that strategy worked out.”
The landscape of television is shifting, and as streaming content becomes more and more popular, it seems likely that the image of families sitting down together on certain nights each week to watch a show together will become a distant memory.
And if entertainment businesses refuse to accept this change, then they will certainly falter. It is time for the industry to embrace this transformation and figure out new ways to distribute or risk being seen as old and out-of-touch.
Companies such as Netflix have changed the focus of the industry from the stars and networks to the consumer — and, for once, the audience is considered the priority.
Whether or not this speaks well for our generation or for the future has yet to be determined, but one thing is certain: If television companies want to keep up with the changes in technology and adapt to their consumer base, they will need to find new ways of giving consumers exactly what they want — and when they want it.

“All he can do is score. Low percentages. He’s going to jack up thirty shots a game and get you seven rebounds a game if you’re lucky. Get ready to tank your percentages and sacrifice virtually every other category.”
That was me last October, talking to my little brother during one of our eight team fantasy basketball drafts. It was the third round, and he was picking fourth.
Flash forward to last week, where this player put up a stat line of 167 points, 14 three-pointers, 33 rebounds, and only six total turnovers. Did I mention he shot 60.9 percent from the field and 86.4 percent from the free throw stripe?
Last week was also our fantasy league’s championship round. In case you were wondering, my brother took home first place.
This player in question is Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks. The stomach-churning tear he went on last week actually crested with him surpassing Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant by a hair’s breadth for the scoring title lead after their duel on Sunday.
The smart money now has Anthony taking home his first career scoring title over Durant (who has won the title the past three years). My hypothesis on why: Carmelo Anthony cannot see hands.
I don’t know how else to explain what I saw from the T.V. in the Daily Trojan Sports Department office last Tuesday. I was sitting on a couch pretending to be engaged in conversation, but really watching Miami’s defensive specialist Shane Battier close out on Anthony over and over again.
Battier put a hand in Anthony’s face: 18-footer swish. Then Battier contested a 26-footer, fingertips inches from Melo’s forehead. Nothing but net.
There’s a hand in Anthony’s face, but you get the feeling he doesn’t see it.
I think maybe four of Anthony’s shots hit the rim that night against Miami. The other 14 shots he made that night didn’t. It’s been a similar story ever since. Anthony is on fire in the month of April, averaging 41.7 points a game on 60.9 percent shooting, including an unconscionable 56 percent from beyond the arc.
Which isn’t to say Durant is completely out of the running. Durant is an efficient, consistent scoring machine. All it would take would be a couple subpar starts from Anthony to put Durant right back in the driver’s seat for the scoring title.
However, for Durant, winning a scoring title never seemed like a matter of life and death. For Anthony, who has been characterized as a heartless gunner (and lives up to his billing by launching 22 shots a game), it almost feels like a potential career-defining moment.
A scoring title means much more for Anthony than it does for Durant, even if the former would never testify to the fact publicly. It would firmly re-establish him at or near the top of the NBA landscape after his less-than-illustrious 2011-2012 campaign. It would acknowledge the work he put in during the offseason to come back in better shape. It could even give him the perspective required of a leader at the helm of a playoff charge, and in doing so, possibly give the Miami Heat a tough series in the Eastern Conference Finals.
If the Heat aren’t careful, this could be the summer where Anthony finally “arrives” and rides the ensuing momentum to push the Knicks, winners of 12 straight, to the precipice of the NBA Finals.
 
It’s all speculation, though. As for what becomes of the Knicks’ current hot streak and their up-and-down season is anybody’s guess. Either way, don’t ask Anthony to predict the future. For now, all he can do is score.

When I came across a poster for Finding Dory on Tumblr, I thought it was another wishful photoshop designed to remind Pixar fans of the inexcusable lack of Dory’s presence in the past decade. Many online reactions were disbelieving, given the unfortunate proximity to April Fools’ Day. When its release was confirmed, however, reactions were both ecstatic and wary.
Pixar has had almost unnatural success in their animated films. Ever since the release of Toy Story in 1995, Disney’s subsidiary has enthralled us with tale after tale that wrenches our hearts for its unusual characters. Over the years, viewers have found themselves caring for a fish, a rat, a couple of monsters whose job it is to scare small children and a group of bugs. Pixar’s 17-year-existence has been as effective at capturing the minds of both children and parents alike as Disney’s traditionally animated classics.
In recent years, however, the company’s success has been less certain. While Pixar was still releasing mainly new stories in new worlds, there was not a single flop. The continuation of the Toy Story franchise was incredibly successful: all three Toy Story films scored 99% or higher on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes (it is easy to imagine that the one percent of critics that did not enjoy Toy Story 3 probably objected to their unwilled sobbing over a group of children’s toys in a crowded theatre, or perhaps did not appreciate the vilification of a teddy bear). While fans had their favorites, none of the films produced were unsuccessful or bad.
This was the case until the release of Cars 2. Despite the enticing idea of Michael Caine as a four-wheeled James Bond, the plot expansion of international espionage did not go over well with critics or with the general public. Was this the beginning of the end? Brave, the first film to really focus on mother/daughter relationships in the Pixar pantheon, was less popular than the company’s past releases. The reason is debatable—some have said that the Scottish accents were difficult to understand, or that the protagonist shamelessly turned her mother into a bear, making her inherently unlikeable. Whatever the reason, Pixar’s last two feature films were significantly less critically and publicly successful.
This isn’t to say that Pixar has lots its touch—before the two flops, they released Up and Toy Story 3; the latter being the highest grossing animated film of all time, and the former making its audience feel more about the protagonist’s marriage in the first ten minutes of the film than the audience ever felt about entire relationships in other wildly popular sagas.
However, it is somewhat concerning to note that Pixar will be coming out with more sequels to previous films than more original films in the next couple of years. Sequels are risks, and the ultimate question behind them is whether they were made with the intention to continue an unfinished or rich story or to capitalize off of the success of a prior film.
At the end of the day, no one can say what the future holds for Finding Dory, or even the upcoming prequel Monsters University to be released in theatres June 21. The sobering thought, though, is that the quality of an upcoming Pixar film even has to be questioned.
