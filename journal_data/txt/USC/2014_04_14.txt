Children affected by diarrheal diseases in sub-Saharan Africa are less likely to receive life-saving oral rehydration therapy if they seek treatment at private clinics, a new study published in the American Journal of Tropical Disease and Hygiene found. This treatment gap between public and private clinics could prevent thousands of lives being lost if closed.
“We estimate that reducing the gap in care between public and private clinics could save the lives of 20,000 children under 5 years old in sub-Saharan Africa each year,” Neeraj Sood, the study’s senior author and director of research at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics at USC, said in a press release.
According to the World Health Organization, diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death for children under 5, claiming 760,000 lives annually. ORT, which involves administering water mixed with sugar and salts, helps prevent dehydration and its resulting deaths. Since its implementation worldwide in 1980, ORT has reduced deaths from diarrheal diseases by two-thirds, and costs just fifty cents per treatment course, according to USC’s press release.
Despite its effectiveness and   low cost, providers at private health clinics, which have been moving in to fill the gap in health care services, are less likely to use ORT and more likely to prescribe pills, syrups, antibiotics, herbal or other treatments that are less effective or even harmful. By analyzing the types of treatment received at different facilities, researchers determined that children under 5 were 22 percent less likely to receive ORT and 61 percent more likely to receive alternate treatments at private clinics, the press release said.
The study looked at data spanning nearly a decade, from 2003 to 2011, and tracked patient data on 19,000 children across 29 African countries. About a quarter of patients received treatment from private clinics, with 71 percent utilizing public facilities and the remaining patients using nonprofit clinics run by NGOs.
“In most countries, there are several regulations governing private clinics, but in practice few of them are enforced, and there is very little government oversight of care provided in the private sector,” Sood said in a press release. “What’s more, governments are generally not involved in continuing medical education to improve the capacity of these private clinics to provide better care.”
Private health providers often include mobile clinics or small pharmacies and clinics staffed by a physician or pharmacist in sub-standard conditions. According to the study, pharmacies were 23 percent less likely to provide ORT compared to other private clinics.
The study also found that this treatment gap affected poorer children more significantly, since individuals in rural areas were 41 percent more likely to seek treatment at private clinics. Poorer children were also less likely to receive ORT at public clinics compared to wealthy children, but the effects were more pronounced at private clinics.
Given the rise of private, for-profit clinics in Africa, further collaboration between the government and private providers is necessary to ensure that proper standards of care are being followed, said Zachary Wagner, a co-author of the study and a doctoral student at UC Berkeley. The authors of the study hope that properly implementing existing treatment courses across the public and private sectors will lead to a decrease in preventable deaths from diarrhea.
“Given the important role that private health care providers are playing in Africa, this research shows that we need to be employing engagement strategies that we know have been successful in helping combat other diseases like HIV and malaria,” Alan Magill, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, said in a press release. “It is an illustration of the hand-in-hand relationship that research plays with clinical care.”

On Monday, the Black Student Assembly hosted a meeting to discuss the incident at The Lorenzo Student Apartments Saturday night during which apartment security shut down the organization’s biannual SC Invite.
Campaign · Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, former executive director of Black Student Assembly, encouraged members to submit negative Yelp reviews. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, the former executive director of BSA, led the meeting and provided tips to its members on how to respond to the Lorenzo incident, such as contacting management officials, submitting negative Yelp reviews and providing eyewitness testimonials.
She went on to compare the invite to previous events hosted at The Lorenzo, such as the Queer Ally Student Assembly’s Second Chance Prom and the USC Program Board’s Globefest.
“None of these organizations were treated the way we were treated,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “[Lorenzo security] told us we were unsafe and out of control.”
Questions and complaints were opened to those in attendance. One BSA member noted the absurdity of the Lorenzo’s claims.
“For them to say this party was out of control, you must have been at a totally different location,” the member said.
Department of Public Safety Captain Ed Palmer and DPS Community Relations Officer Kenn Whittaker were also in attendance and explained to BSA members the reason for their presence Saturday night.
“As students, wherever you guys go, we’re going to be there,” Whittaker said. “If it’s USC involved, we’re going to be there. Our invested interest is you guys.”
Whittaker further explained that upon arriving at the Lorenzo, per the complex’s request, he didn’t see the necessity for additional force. Captain Palmer stated that he supported BSA’s efforts in dealing with the matter, and encouraged Lorenzo to explain its actions.
“You’re doing the right thing,” Palmer said. “You need to make them accountable [because] they should be. The Lorenzo would like to say they are part of the university. [President C. L. Max Nikias] had made it clear they are most assuredly not.”
Amoafo-Yeboah also noted that USC Student Affairs is aware of the situation and is currently working to release a statement regarding the incident.
“I wanted you guys to know the administration does care and they’re aware,” Amoafo-Yeboah said.
Kwynn Butts, an executive board member of BSA, spoke with the Daily Trojan after the event and stressed the organization was emphasizing professionalism in handling the Lorenzo incident.
“[The members of BSA] have an understanding that things need to be handled in a certain way and professionalism is an absolute must,” Butts said. “We want to get the facts straight, we’re not trying to cause unnecessary issues; we just want to solve the problem and go about it the right way.”

With the imminent redevelopment of University Village, 21 Choices, the frozen yogurt shop located in the area, is about to close up shop -— but not before taking a few final weeks to show its appreciation to USC students.
At the end of the semester, 21 Choices will have to vacate its current location, along with the rest of the shops and restaurants in University Village. The frozen yogurt shop — which primarily serves USC students and routinely closes over the winter holidays — remained closed into the new year, but recently reopened for the last few weeks of the semester.
Tony Husson, who co-owns the shop with his brother, said briefly reopening before closing the location is their way of showing their gratitude to the students who have been loyal customers.
“We want to say thank you to the students,” Husson said. “They’ve been a pleasure to serve.”
To make the reopening possible, Husson had to limit the shop’s operating hours. 21 Choices will only be open from 3-10 p.m. Monday- through Thursday, the hours with the greatest student traffic.
Husson owes the reopening to two USC students, Lauren Rados and Emily Williams, who told him they wanted to see the shop reopened. Rados and Williams came into the shop when it was still closed earlier in the semester and suggested that Husson consider limited hours.
“I was in the store one day trying to figure out how to do this,” Husson said. “And we did what they said and it’s working.”
Williams and Rados have always been dedicated customers and were disappointed when the shop didn’t reopen in January and are sad to see it closing again at the end of the semester.
For Williams, the quality of the product as well as the atmosphere made 21 Choices special.
“We were very adamant about it reopening and told him how much it meant to us,” Williams said. “It’s amazing yogurt, we love it. But we would also use it as a great outlet. A place to meet and talk and hang out.”
Most of the new staff at 21 Choices are USC students, an intentional decision by Husson. Many of them were customers themselves, picked out of line and invited to apply for a position. By offering flexible hours and paying $12 per hour, Husson hopes to make working at 21 Choices — even if only for a short while — a positive experience.
“We really want to set up a system where outgoing and friendly students serve other students,” he said. “They can work even one hour if they want. But that hour should add to their life.”
Leesa Danzek, a sophomore majoring in political science, recently started working at 21 Choices and is one of the students who was invited to apply for a job when she came in as a customer. Danzek says she’ll be sad to see the store close.
“I wish it would stay open,” Danzek said. “From my experience so far, it’s always packed and there’s always a line out the door. Everyone loves it.”
The plan is for the shop to stay open at least until the first week of May, but Husson hopes to be able to stay open until graduation. He hopes to treat graduating seniors to free frozen yogurt on the last day of classes to thank them for being loyal customers.
The eventual demolition and redevelopment of University Village has been a part of USC’s Master Plan since 21 Choices opened at the location in 2009. Husson hopes to be able to come back to a new location in the USC area, ideally on campus.

Crowds of distinguished ladies and gentlemen, some in ’40s-style hats, flooded the iconic stretch of Hollywood Boulevard last weekend from Thursday, April 10 to Sunday, April 13 to attend the 5th Annual Turner Classic Movie Film Festival. Held by the Turner Classic Movies channel, which celebrates its 20th birthday this year, the four-day festival is a bonanza of classical Hollywood cinema that stretches 70-plus years from the earliest film — Why Worry? from 1923 -— to the latest, 1995’s Mr. Holland’s Opus.
Classic · The Turner Classic Movie Film Festival brought together classic film lovers from all over Los Angeles last weekend. – Photo courtesy of Chelsea Barredo
 
The festival opened with a red carpet and screening of the recently restored Oklahoma! The festivities included a live appearance by Shirley Jones in the sumptuous TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX. Despite being able to seat almost 1,000 people, lines for films such as Double Indemnity twisted around the block. And at all the screenings, the filmgoers queued up at least half an hour before showtime.
Film screenings, panels and various special events took place in historic venues along the Walk of Fame. Some nostalgic movie palaces played host; the striking Egyptian Theatre, which showed the romantic comedy The Goodbye Girl and politically minded science-fiction thriller Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the El Captain, complete with its fabulous theater organ, played Phantom of the Opera tunes throughout the night.
Another highlight was the relaxed poolside screenings at the Roosevelt Hotel, such as American Graffiti from 1979 and the original The Muppet Movie. The majority of the films shown, however, were in the three smaller theaters of TCL Chinese 6.
There were also talks hosted in the Montalban Theatre and a horror make-up panel that took place in The Hollywood Museum, which regularly houses a plethora of costumes and props.
“TCM at 20: Inspired by the Classics” was another new component of the festival, which was a display of celebrity artwork at Club TCM. On Thursday, Bruce Eric Kaplan, Charles Busch, Jane Seymour and Kim Novak took to the stage to discuss their art. Busch contributed a strikingly simple illustration of dancers in which one breaks the fourth wall and looks straight at the audience. Novak, known for her performance in Alfred Hitchock’s Vertigo, spoke about how she was able to take control of the film in her Vertigo-inspired artwork. There was art from Tony Bennett, Manolo Blahnik, Charles Busch, Jules Feiffer, Joel Grey, Bruce Eric Kaplan, Kim Novak, Todd Oldham, Jane Seymour and Burt Young interspersed with memorabilia from the classics: Dorothy’s iconic gingham dress from one corner, the piano in Casablanca and a piece of concept art from Gone With the Wind in another.
In a showing of On Approval, film historian Jeffery Vance quoted L. P. Hartley, “The past is a foreign country: They do things differently there.” The entire film festival seemed to launch its viewers into this different place, back when the world was seen through a black and white lens. At the same time, this year’s central theme was “Family in the Movies: The Ties that Bind,” and it succeeded in connecting the films and our lives with this timeless and universal concern.
Movies were grouped into films about single mothers, such as The Goodbye Girl, or daddy/daughter Films, such as Father of the Bride. There were films about sister acts, such as Vincent Minnelli’s Meet Me in St. Louis, which stars Judy Garland and Margaret O’Brien, who was present at the festival. There were films about aging parents, such as Best Boy, directed by Ira Wohl, who holds a master’s degree in social work from USC. Last but not least, there were films about dysfunctional families, exemplified in the twisted dynamics of The Lion in Winter in which a restoration of the original film beautifully showed all the ups and downs of family with too much power.
Time-honored classics, such as Gone with the Wind or The Wizard of Oz were screened alongside what the event called “Discoveries” — lesser-known films such as On Approval and Godzilla (the original Japanese version), which was one of the few non-English films.
The festival paid tribute to the late Charles Heston, who was honored on a stamp at the festival, Maureen O’Hara, Quincy Jones, and  Richard Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss, Jones and Novak shared their anecdotes with audiences at panels and before screenings of their films. On Sunday, there was a tribute to Mickey Rooney with Eddie Muller. Margaret O’Brien spoke and then read a poem written by Rooney, followed by a screening of National Velvet.
Passing the torch is an appropriate way to describe celebrity Anna Kendrick’s appearance at a screening of George Cukor’s The Women at El Capitan.
“This is a film the smart young women have to see and know,” Kendrick said of the classic film education her mentors have given her.
Admittedly, films these days are not made like they used to make them, in that recognizable rhythm and sensibility, and much of the content of classical cinema would not pass in today’s society. Classical films, however, are still relevant as history lessons, as a form of escapism, but also because they are really still just that good whether you are 16 or 60.

“People walking, people walking.”
It was a hot day, skirting the high ’80s last Tuesday, when I went with my class on a tour — for lack of a better word –— around Skid Row.
My professor had told us to dress in an unprovocative way and wear closed-toed shoes. So, despite the warm weather, my attire for the afternoon was dark-wash jeans and a baggy T-shirt with no symbols or labels. But when I got out of the car on East 6th Street and Stanford Avenue, I realized that I would stand out — regardless of what I wore.
The Skid Row community is just that, a community – it knows its own. Though my classmates and I all come from diverse walks of life, when we stepped onto the street, we morphed into one homogenous group: outsiders.
The inhabitants stared at us as we walked down the street in one tight cluster. Not sure what to do, but also not wanting to keep my head down, I stared back. It was hard not to feel like we were in a zoo. All of us in our own cages, looking in and looking out.
Our guide for the afternoon was Kevin Michael Key of the Los Angeles Poverty Department — the other LAPD — which is working to build a sense of community on Skid Row through the arts. As he shuttled us along the sidewalk, he stopped to explain what we were seeing, telling us the stories of some of the denizens of Skid Row and introducing us to them.
I took in the cardboard boxes,  the shopping carts and the tents. On the sidewalk, some people were talking to others around them, some to voices only they could hear. Some were shooting up. And then there were those just sitting there listlessly in the sun.
A few had laid out a hardscrabble collection of items on their tarps, either to sell or just to look at. One of the collections, a small selection of second-hand VHS tapes and paperback books that were gathering dust, caught my eye. My favorite book, To Kill A Mockingbird, was tucked among the brood.
Skid Row is a place that breaks your heart in moments. I have only come here a few times, but every time I return, I realize that I forget the details, the reality of the situation. Skid Row houses one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States, and a significant percentage of the people there have mental illnesses of one kind or another. There are services available for the community — on the tour we passed by places like the Downtown Mental Health Center (a branch of the Department of Mental Health), the Union Rescue Mission and the Midnight Mission, popularized by Steve Lopez’s column in the Los Angeles Times. But many people are not yet ready to come off the streets and accept these services.
The noise is the other thing I forgot about — walking around there is the sound of music blasting from the radios and of people screaming at each other, at themselves. There is a chaos of noise here; a cacophony of sound that pulses and throbs.
On our walk, we stopped inside Lamp Community’s art program. The Lamp Community works to end homelessness in Los Angeles through housing and service. In the noise-dampened walls of the studio, there is an instant contrast to the outside uproar. The workshop is open to anyone, and the walls of the building are draped with artwork from the program. Some of the paintings include words: “Skid Row Love,” “Skid Row Community,” “Skid Raw.” One of them depicted Los Angeles covered in a thick coat of brown slime. But the piece that held my attention was of a woman drawn in grayscale with heavy black eyeliner and a hard stance, holding a gun. Her hair is dark purple and wild, set against a technicolor rainbow background. Blurs of reds, yellows and greens take up the space behind her, the swirls and checkerboards creating an abstract tornado.
We talked for a little with Hayk Makhmuryan, the fine arts coordinator for Lamp Community, who said a lot of interesting things about the program, what it’s doing for residents, its open mic nights once a month and its collaborative art projects. But what I remember most is the point he made about volunteers. It was almost an afterthought, tossed in as a known commodity: poverty and mental illness just aren’t as attractive as volunteering with children or puppies.
Having only spent an afternoon there, it was hard to argue with that point. I felt out of place and uncomfortable as I walked along the streets with my class. Skid Row is not an easy place to just step into. You can’t just say, “I’m here!”
One person on the street stared at our class as we walked past her.
“Are you for real?” she asked.
I didn’t have a response.
Right at the end of the visit, back at the LAPD office, a woman outside, all angular and bony, collapsed on the sidewalk. People helped her into the shade. The cause was unclear: it could have been drugs, or it could have been that she hadn’t slept for days. Or maybe some combination of the two.
Writing this, I can’t describe what her face looked like as I passed by her. Maybe I wasn’t looking hard enough. But I don’t think I really even looked.
“People walking, people walking,” was Kevin Michael’s constant refrain as he walked us through people camped out on the sides of the streets, letting them know that we were just passing through.
And that’s exactly what it felt like we were doing that afternoon, just passing through. A 10-minute trip in the car and I was back at USC, showering and putting on a nice outfit to go to attend a musical in Orange County. But the shock of purple hair in that painting stayed with me — that image of the woman holding the gun, with so many emotions on her face.
You can’t see Skid Row from a non-superficial level in one afternoon, or even in a few. But just as the people in the organizations we met with that afternoon, such as  Lamp and LAPD hope to use the arts as one way for the Skid Row community to connect with themselves, maybe it can also be a way for those who live outside of Skid Row to connect with those inside of it.
I hope so. Skid Row is 10 minutes from USC — it shouldn’t be so easy to drive away from.

Ktown Night Market is Koreantown’s first multi-ethnic art, food and performance festival.
On April 18 and 19, the first Ktown Night Market brings the Ktown and surrounding communities together. The night market is modeled off of festivals that are popular in Asian countries and will include art installations, food trucks, live performances, and local business vendors. The event grew from a love of the community and a desire to bring something fresh to Koreatown.
“We party here, eat here, live here but felt there was something missing, especially for second and third generation [immigrants],” said  Danny Park, one of the market’s founders. “We [also] felt non-Korean business owners and residents were not being recognized.” The majority of vendors are local to Koreatown but represent many ethnicities and interests.
“Ktown has become so much more. [We want] to celebrate the diversity … It’s about the city, not just one culture,” Park said.
This inclusive attitude is evident in the festival’s food truck line-up. The Seoul Sausage Company has strong ties to Koreatown and is the event’s official food truck curator. The food truck won season three of Food Network’s The Great Food Truck Race and will be featured alongside the winners of seasons one and two — Grill ’Em All and The Lime Truck. Grill ’Em All serves mouth-watering burgers while The Lime Truck offers California cuisine. The Lime Truck, or TLT, also has brick and mortar locations — in Downtown Los Angeles and Westwood, Calif., The Ktown Night Market’s Food Truck Alley marks the first time the three champions will be together.
The festival is holding a Last Food Truck Contest, which allows people to vote on their favorite truck via Facebook. This contest invites participation and demonstrates the open and integrative nature behind Ktown Night Market.
Other tasty options include East Los Angeles Tacos, Fluff Ice and the India Jones Chow Trucks. Fluff Ice serves frozen treats, such as Fusion Green Tea Fluff, a combination of green tea ice, red beans, mocha and condensed milk. East Los Angeles Tacos offers more substantial fare — its menu blends Korean and Hispanic flavors to create bold and savory dishes. The India Jones Chow Truck, which frequents USC, serves up Indian street food that tastes better than most restaurant fare.
In addition to food trucks, Ktown Night Market offers local business owners a platform to promote their wares.
“Ktown is usually first-generation dominated … We want to give second- and third-generation business owners a platform to showcase their stuff,” Park said. There will be over 100 vendors as well as carnival style games and booths.
“There will be lots of clothing vendors … It will be a very trendy event,” said KCM Agency publicist Stella Cho.
Ktown Night Market will also feature music and dance performances, such as hip-hop performer PARKER (Dumbfounded + DJ Zo) and K-Pop’s Chad Future. Many arts are associated with Kollaboration, a nonprofit arts organization that promotes diversity through grassroots performances. In just 14 years, the organization has expanded to host annual shows in 14 different cities and provided a platform for minority performers.
“The Ktown Night Market will be another outlet for Kollaboration participants,” Park said.
Aside from music, Ktown Night Market will have live art installations, where artists will create unique works during the event. These art pieces and live performances encourage community involvement and provide a singular experience for attendees.
“We’re all friends here, we’ve always shared a fun vibe — encouraging art and young [talent],”  Park said.
Though this is the first Ktown Night Market, Park hopes to make it an annual or biannual event. He views it as an ideal way to encourage community participation and support local businesses.
“Ktown Night Market is about the unification of Koreatown,” Park said. “Right now each generation does their own thing but there are all kinds of people here — we really want to promote that.”
 
The night market is free and open to all. It will be held at the Robert F. Kennedy Community School on April 18 from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. and April 19 from 2 p.m. to 12 a.m.

The giant machine of bro tanks, charging stations, crop-tops, port-o-potties, shuttles and tribal prints that is Coachella is upon us once again. The only weekend of the year when grown men can wear lights on their fingers and dress like they’re 17, the festival featured its usual mix of crowd-pleasing superstars and up-and-coming acts, all strewn about a surrealist field of sculptural installations and giant tents and stages. If there was any noticeable difference between this and past years’, it’s that the festival is continuing on its on trajectory away from its humble indie-rock beginnings and toward the corporate grandiosity of raves such as Hard or Ultra Fest.
After a 12-year hiatus, the highly anticipated OutKast reunion between- André 3000 and Big Boi took place Friday night at the main stage. Taking a page out of Flying Lotus’ book, they performed from behind a cube of transparent screens onto which images were projected as they played through their older hits. Despite the impressive visual effects, the show could hardly be considered a success. Distracting yells from the DJ/hype man, an unenthused — even slightly perturbed — André 3000 and a puzzling guest appearance by Future all contributed to a disappointing performance. Sure, André and Big can hardly be blamed for the sound problems (the latter interrupted his verses about 10 times to say, “Turn me up in the monitors,”) or the blatant advertising for Future’s new album that was most likely forced by his record company. But, especially on André’s part, there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm contrasted to the hype preceding their reunion. Decked out in a baseball cap, a sweatshirt and overalls, André’s nonchalant demeanor was reflected by the crowd’s response. Even the most devout OutKast fans who knew every word to their most obscure songs found themselves underwhelmed.
In contrast to OutKast’s inability to live up to their ’90s reputation, Queensbridge rapper Nas had the outdoor stage looking more like 1994 than 2014. Nearing the 20th anniversary of his classic album Illmatic, Nas was joined by Jay Z as they played “Dead Presidents II,” a song that started a public feud between the two MC’s in 1996. With this unpleasantness behind them, the duo played off of each other and energized the crowd with their presence. Besides the cordiality between Jay Z and Nas, the only reminder that it was not, in fact, 1996 was the sea of smartphones that popped up to record the magic and block everyone’s view as soon as people realized it was Jay Z who had appeared on stage.
An obvious parallel to this example of the frustrations of 21st century concert-going came during Chance the Rapper’s set. Comparable to a young Nas, or maybe The Pharcyde, Chance gained notoriety not through agents or marketing, but old-fashioned rhyming skills and a fresh, underground aesthetic. With a possible nod to André 3000, the 21-year-old Chicago native was clad in overalls, but didn’t let that stop him from dancing and jumping around, even kicking above his head at one point.
Many fans knew all the words to even his lesser-known hits, and his concert had an intimate feel. That is, until a small figure in a bucket hat and bandana pranced on stage and Chance shouted, “Justin, what the f—k is up?” The show instantly went from a Chance the Rapper show to a Justin Bieber show, as giddy fans who had never heard of Chance flocked to get a glimpse of the golden child. Even raver bros heard the commotion and pulled themselves away from the dope drops of the electronic dance music tent, only to look back at their friends with disgust when Chance told them, “Give it up for Justin Bieber!” Still, Chance’s performance was a highlight of the weekend, as he brought the energy of his studio tracks and infused them with intricate guitar solos and drum parts that can’t be heard on his albums. And as he moves from unknown to Bieber collaborator, his fan base reflects the change, which gives a whole new meaning to his tour, which is called “The Social Experiment.”
Hard rockers Queens of the Stone Age had a social message of their own, which they conveyed with a blatantly preachy performance piece. This consisted of a suited woman who approaches a gas pump set up in front of the stage. She then goes on to maniacally drink the “gas” from the pump until she falls over, as the meter continues to count the money being made. Since they were playing to a crowd that was in the process of desecrating a field with plastic water bottles and Styrofoam plates, the environmentally conscious skit was not without irony.
With the swarms of concertgoers being shuttled into the Empire Polo Club comes an equally impressive swarm of staff that somehow manages to make the field spotless before the next day. With $9 beers and $1,500 V.I.P. passes, the festival is able to pay for a ludicrous number of workers, strobe lights, tents and even a giant inflatable spaceman on wheels. Only in regard to the shuttles did Coachella find itself underprepared. The first night, many people who stayed for all of OutKast’s set and had paid for the shuttle service to take them back found themselves caught in a sluggish zoo of people lined up to get on a limited number of shuttles. Many didn’t get back until 5 a.m., but to Coachella’s credit, more shuttles were hired for the next two days and this problem was avoided.
Much of the weekend was filled with a paradoxical feeling of people deploring Coachella’s moral vapidity while consciously being a part of it. For those ready to whip out their cell phones and Snapchat their friends to show them what big names they were seeing, Coachella did not disappoint. Surprise guest appearances from Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, Snoop Dogg and even Blondie will be remembered in the following days.
With that being said, the festival still manages to cater to the hipster sensibilities of those who scoff at big names and Top 40 hits. Before his set, Jeff Mangum, lead singer of indie darlings Neutral Milk Hotel, politely asked the crowd, “Can I ask you to put your cameras and cell phones away? I like to see you guys and be present here right now.” Their mostly acoustic set, which was not blown up on the big video screens, was a reprieve for those uninterested in the flashy lasers and production of Calvin Harris, Duck Sauce, Skrillex and the like. For those with jazzy sensibilities, Trombone Shorty and The Preservation Hall Jazz Band surely entertained. And acts such as Bryan Ferry, The Replacements, and even Arcade Fire joined by Blondie provided the older crowd with some entertainment.
Though there are still those purists who come to see their favorite rock bands and possibly discover some new ones, one can’t help but feel that these people are being gradually outnumbered by those who come to see and be seen, or else just to get sufficiently inebriated and go hard to the booming bass of whatever DJ’s dance remix of a Rihanna song is currently popular. Complete with the Sephora Collection Beauty Studio, exclusive after-parties, blogs devoted to festival fashion and the inexplicable “Coachella Diet” (yes, that is a real thing), one can almost feel the soul being sucked out of what started out as a music festival for music lovers.

After a remarkable first season at the helm of the program, USC women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke has continued her run of success with the hiring of two impressive new assistant coaches. Cooper-Dyke’s staff now includes longtime San Diego State head coach Beth Burns and former Fresno State standout Taja Edwards.
Helping hands · Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, who led the Women of Troy to their first postseason appearance since 2006, will welcome new associate head coach Beth Burns and assistant coach Taja Edwards. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
Burns, who played college ball at Ohio Wesleyan, was named associate head coach under Cooper-Dyke. Burns began her head-coaching career with the Aztecs in 1989. She would stay there for eight seasons before moving on to Ohio State, where she coached from 1997 to 2002. In 2000, she guided the Buckeyes to a WNIT championship. Burns returned to San Diego State in 2005, leading the team to an unprecedented eight-year run of success. In 2010, the Aztecs advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament, where they upset 6th-seeded Texas and 3rd-seeded West Virginia. In 2013, Burns led San Diego State to a program-best 27 wins and its second straight Mountain West Conference championship. She was also named conference coach of the year in 2012 and 2013. In all, Burns has made eight NCAA tournament appearances in 21 years of head coaching, along with six conference coach of the year awards.
Burns’ tenure at San Diego State, however, was not without controversy. In April 2013, she unexpectedly quit after perhaps her most successful season with the program. Many claimed that she was forced to retire after a video surfaced that depicted her striking an assistant coach with a clipboard. Burns, however, maintains that she was forced out for comments she made regarding the university’s poor treatment of women’s athletics programs. Burns recently filed a wrongful termination suit against the school.
Cooper-Dyke is supportive and appreciative of Burns.
“Beth is a legend,” Cooper-Dyke told USC Trojans. “She established a winning culture at San Diego State that is in line with what we are working to do here at USC. She [is] a defensive-minded coach who has such wisdom when it comes to college basketball. Her passion and energy also make her a great fit for us here at USC, and I’m very eager to have her on staff.”
New assistant coach Taja Edwards, a highly successful former college basketball player who appeared in the NCAA tournament four times with Fresno State, will bring youth the USC’s coaching staff. Edwards was a McDonald’s All-American at Long Beach Poly High School, where she also won two state championships. She began her collegiate coaching career as an assistant at Ole Miss, where she spent the 2012-2013 season. The Carson, Calif. native spent last season as an assistant at Cal State Fullerton. Cooper-Dyke is impressed by Edwards’ combination of youth and experience.
“Taja is a bright, young coach who I really believe has a great future,” Cooper-Dyke told USC Trojans. “She has NCAA Tournament experience as a player, so she knows what it takes to succeed as a student-athlete on the court and in the classroom.”
Burns and Edwards will replace former assistants Brandy Manning and Evan Unrau, who helped lead the Women of Troy to a dramatic but successful 2013-2014 season. The team got off to a hot start, but struggled down the stretch of the Pac-12 schedule. With its NCAA tournament chances in serious jeopardy, USC won four straight games to capture the Pac-12 conference tournament title. That run included a monumental upset over No. 6 Stanford in the semifinals.
Though the team lost in heartbreaking fashion to St. John’s in the opening round of the NCAA tournament, the season still marked the team’s first postseason appearance since 2006. Cooper-Dyke is convinced that her recent hires can take the Women of Troy to the next level.
“I’m so excited to have Beth and Taja on board,” Cooper-Dyke told USC Trojans. “I think this staff is a strong group, and I know the team looks forward to learning and working with them, too. We got a taste of victory this past season, and I believe this staff can carry this program even further.”

As USC enters its final week of spring practice, the feeling of optimism that head coach Steve Sarkisian carried with him during his introductory press conference has not dissipated, but rather intensified. On the practice field, coaches are energized, players are engaged and just about everyone seems to be genuinely excited to be there.
Home grown · Head coach Steve Sarkisian places special emphasis on local talent — 15 of his 19 recruits this year were from Southern California. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
All of this positive energy is great, but the top reason for why this optimism seems to have some legs to it is simple — this is an incredibly talented, deep football team.
The 2014 USC Trojans are an anomaly — a team entering the first year under a new head coach that legitimately has championship aspirations. These lofty goals aren’t simply the demands of a large, spoiled and opinionated fanbase — all traits of which the Trojan Family will gladly claim ownership — but they are instead genuinely realistic expectations.
A look at the depth chart at nearly every position group shows top-end, widely sought-after talent that has made its way from the top of Scout and Rivals recruiting rankings to the USC roster. There are at least a dozen or so future NFL players currently on the team, and even more will arrive in the summer when the rest of the Trojans’ recruiting class of 2014 enrolls in school.
This is not supposed to be the look of a team that is one year removed from firing its head coach midseason. So how could a program be in this good of shape in the wake of coaching turmoil and NCAA penalties? Despite the manner in which the USC image has been tarnished in the past few years by sanctions and disappointing seasons, causing the rest of the country to forget about the Trojans, talented players still want to come play here.
Part of the reason so many good players come to USC is because of its location. With the memory of cold winters and rainy springs fresh in his mind, Sarkisian is very aware of how his new school’s locale plays to his benefit.
Aside from the beaches and 70-degree weather, though, the dense population and easy access to Southern California’s blue chip recruits is the most advantageous aspect of USC’s location. Add in the fact that Los Angeles has no NFL team, and the ceiling for high school players, in terms of being exposed to big-time football, is USC. This creates a heavy presence of high school players at every USC practice — essentially it’s free airtime for Sarkisian and his assistants to sell their program just by running a smooth, exciting and fun practice.
“We’re one of those rare schools in the country that we’ve got a great deal of recruits within driving distance of our campus,” Sarkisian said. “We’re fortunate we’ve got a beautiful campus, and the kids like to come and watch. That’s one of the reasons why USC has been USC for so long. Southern California is a very populated area — there’s a lot of people and a lot of good football players, and they have an opportunity to come watch our guys work and play and feel motivated being on our practice field and being in the Coliseum. That’s all part of the process.”
For a school that never needs to worry about budget cuts and has one of the most profitable football programs in the country, money is never an issue. So it figures that the most talent-rich area in the nation just so happens to be in USC’s backyard. That means that the cost of travel for recruiting is significantly lowered — call it a case of the rich getting richer.
“A lot of schools get on airplanes to fly to Los Angeles to recruit,” Sarkisian said. “Our coaches get in cars and drive on the 405 and the 110 and the 10 freeway. There are only two of us in Los Angeles. Both of us reap some of the benefits of that as opposed to some other schools that aren’t in Los Angeles.”
Of course, recruiting in your own backyard is not some new, groundbreaking approach to college football recruiting. It’s a deeply ingrained philosophy that dates back to the beginning of the sport itself; it’s also a strategy that USC seems to have gone away from in recent years.
In USC’s class of 2014, Sarkisian’s first class, 15 of the 19 players signed were from Southern California. In the previous two classes combined, only 14 of the 27 players signed were from Southern California, which is a startlingly low ratio, especially considering the resurgence of UCLA’s program in recent years.
This is not a critique on the philosophy of USC’s previous coaching staff, which operated under a litany of mitigating circumstances. That the program is in this good of shape this quickly after NCAA sanctions have limited the past three recruiting classes is a testament to the tremendous job done largely by one man — former head coach Lane Kiffin.
One of the most reviled and openly mocked figures in college football endured his fair share of criticism while at USC, and many of them seemed to simply love hating him. But one area that the detractors stayed away from was Kiffin’s recruiting, which has always been heralded as his strength.
Kiffin’s recruiting classes always ranked near the top of every scouting service’s year-end rankings, and though he turned in mixed on-field results, USC fans should immediately fully reap the benefits of Kiffin’s efforts as Sarkisian kicks off his first season.
Kiffin and Sarkisian are longtime friends, and after years of competing against one another in the same conference, they no doubt have battled for the same recruits at one time or another. But with Kiffin gone to Alabama and Sarkisian taking his place, the former, unintentionally of course, has made the latter’s job much easier by leaving the cupboard stocked with talent.

The No. 23-ranked USC men’s golf team tied for sixth this past weekend at the Western Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at Pasatiempo Golf Course in Santa Cruz, Calif. USC finished the tournament a combined 22-over par. Led by freshman Rico Hoey, who finished the tournament in a three-way tie for third place, the Trojans were disappointed with a 12-over par final round on Sunday.

The No. 6 Stanford Cardinal  won the tournament, while No. 15 Washington finished second. No. 2 California ended up in third place  and unranked Oregon and San Diego State landed in fourth and fifth place.  USC tied unranked Arizona State for the sixth spot.
After finishing the first round in fifth place, only eight strokes behind second-place Washington, USC struggled to climb the leaderboards during Sunday’s final round. Though this tournament does not provide the Trojans with much momentum heading into the Pac-12 championships, USC head coach Chris Zambri remained confident that this team has all the tools needed in order to succeed and compete with the top schools in the conference.
“This week was somewhat disappointing,” Zambri said. “If we are to make some noise this postseason we need production from everyone, not just a couple of guys per tournament. I think we are capable of winning tournaments, but it really does not matter what I think. What matters is how we play and we need to play better.”
Junior Anthony Paolucci finished in a tie for 50th place at 10-over par and junior Paul Smith ended up tied for 62nd at 12-over par. Meanwhile, senior Jeffrey Kang shot a 3-over to place 23rd on the individual leaderboard and senior Ramsey Sahyoun tied for 72nd place at 14-over.
Though Hoey’s streak of rounds in the 60s ended at seven this weekend, with an even-par 70 on Sunday, he continues to be the Trojans’ captain heading into postseason play. If the Trojans are to turn Hoey’s efforts into team success, other golfers on the roster must kick it up a notch. USC’s win at the San Diego Classic last month proved that the men’s golf team has shown it has individual talent to win these upcoming tournaments, beginning with the Pac-12 Championships. They will need to put together a strong team effort, however, in order to come away with hardware.

USC senior forward Cassie Harberts was selected by the Atlanta Dream with the 20th pick in the 2014 WNBA draft Monday in Uncasville, Conn. Harberts will be reuniting with current Atlanta Dream head coach and former USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper, who was Harberts’ coach in her first three years at USC.

In her final two years at USC, Harberts provided an invaluable post presence both offensively and defensively.
The two-time Pac-12 All Academic Honorable Mention award winner averaged 18.0 points and 8.2 rebounds per game in her breakout junior season in 2012-2013. Harberts provided valuable leadership and stability in a season fraught with difficulty as the Women of Troy stumbled to an 11-20 record and underwent a coaching change from Cooper to current head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke.
Harberts was USC’s leader going into the new regime under Cooper-Dyke, and though the senior’s averages dropped slightly to 15.4 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, her field goal percentage increased from .438 to .453 in her final season.
The Women of Troy shocked No. 4 Stanford, 72-68, in the semifinal round of the Pac-12 Tournament behind 10 straight points from Harberts in the closing three minutes. USC would go on to win the Pac-12 title, but eventually bow out of the NCAA Tournament in the first round.
Perhaps Harberts’ most notable contribution to the Women of Troy, however, was her durability and consistency: The forward never missed a single start or game in her four seasons at USC, and scored in double digits in 30 of her 35 starts during her senior season.
Harberts will look to bring her strength in the post and consistent play to the Atlanta Dream, a perennial WNBA title contender that has appeared in the WNBA Finals in three of the last four seasons, but has yet to win a championship.
Harberts becomes the 11th USC women’s basketball player to be drafted into the WNBA, a list that includes Cooper-Dyke, seven-time WNBA All-Star and two-time WNBA champion Lisa Leslie and WNBA all-time leading scorer Tina Thompson.
Schools from the Pac-12 Conference had four players picked in the first two rounds of the WNBA draft, including No. 1 overall pick Chiney Ogwumike of Stanford.

Starting from those formative toddler years, I soaked up everything that my parents enjoyed. When it came to music, I was stuck with what they liked. It wasn’t until much later that I discovered all of the music out there. I appreciated the revolutionary musical groundwork laid by The Beatles, all while blasting Run-DMC in my car. I love the Dixie Chicks for their lyrical candor, and I thank The Black Keys for introducing me to the world of alternative music. Needless to say, my interests in music are no longer confined to the classic tunes my parents play.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
As a lover of many music genres, I’ve learned to recognize the brilliance of artists that have paved the way for changes in all facets of music. I’m thankful that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame praises various artists each year for their historic contributions because I believe that this recognition sets a high caliber for music. Each year, a selection of musical acts, reviewed by an elite review board, is inducted into this Hall of Fame, representing the movers and shakers in rock music. On April 10, Cat Stevens, Hall & Oates, Kiss, Linda Ronstadt, Nirvana, Peter Gabriel and three others solidified their standing in the musical world. Unfortunately, these achievements by some of my favorite bands revealed some startling limitations to this honor.
First, the criteria of this members-only club for determining who should be considered one of the greats is very rigid and limiting. According to The New York Times, the selection committee that grants artists entrance into this prestigious club is controlled by six individuals. To me, these few individuals don’t represent popular opinion. Rather, they seem to shape popular opinion about music. Music is interpreted differently by everyone for its meaning, and certain bands draw a special connection to specific listeners. This selection committee, without really exploring what certain bands mean to all people, manipulates what is deemed the greatest. It is very hard to measure, especially in this subjective context, which musical acts have rippled the music industry or impacted culture in a grand way. It’s no wonder that certain bands such as Guns N’ Roses and the Sex Pistols have famously boycotted the ceremony even though they were inducted.
Though rock music finds its roots in rhythm and blues, it has expanded and adapted to different styles of music over the years. Rock music is no longer fenced around Elvis Presley or James Brown, and many more artists have made significant contributions to the music world, even if they skirt around the conventional conception of “rock.” According The New York Times, legendary hip-hop groups such as N.W.A. were passed over once again. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band was also omitted from the list, even though it has influenced many of today’s leading acts today. Music is a fluid institution, and even though it boasts clear rankings, these genres are interweaving webs, feeding into one another. This induction ceremony is a celebration of music. By excluding acts because they don’t fit the mold is to do the opposite of that. There needs to be an inclusion of all types of music in this setting.
That said, the new inductees to the Hall of Fame are legendary in their own right. “Beth” by Kiss and “Smells like Teen Spirit” by Nirvana are two of my personal anthems. I vow to someday recreate that scene from 500 Days of Summer with “You Make My Dreams” by Hall & Oates. Maybe I’ll become Vine-famous.
The bottom line is, music is great; music completes who we are. Having a seemingly dominating presence set the standard of what should be interwoven in our lives is absolutely ludicrous. So, like Axl Rose, I shake my head at the Hall of Fame for ignoring the range of artists out there.

Feminism is under siege once again, and the culprit this time is actually a rather powerful woman in her own right: film actress and May’s Harper’s Bazaar UK coverstar Kirsten Dunst. The award-winning actress of the Spider-Man series and 2011’s Melancholia is being lambasted for her statements in an interview with the 85-year-old fashion publication.
“I feel like the feminine has been a little undervalued,” Dunst told Ajesh Patalay of Harper’s Bazaar UK. “We all have to get our own jobs and make our own money, but staying at home, nurturing, being the mother, cooking — it’s a valuable thing my mum created. And sometimes, you need your knight in shining armour. I’m sorry. You need a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman. That’s why relationships work.”
Dunst’s comments were not well-received by the feminist community. Jezebel writer Erin Gloria Ryan dismissed Dunst’s words, writing, “I’m not going to couch this much because Kirsten Dunst is not paid to write gender theory so it shouldn’t surprise anyone that she’s kind of dumb about it.”
Jezebel isn’t especially known for its tact — and why should it be? The publication has a reputation for irreverence. Yet the types of responses that are penned by the likes of Ryan hurt the cause of feminism more than help. When writers such as Ryan are given free rein to arrogantly dismiss the opinions of the precise group they seek to protect, it undermines the feminist cause that Jezebel purports to promote and, in turn, detracts from the credibility of the publication itself.
Jezebel’s founder Anna Holmes told The Telegraph in Oct. 2013 that she started Jezebel with the mission of empowering women and giving them a credible voice in political discourse.
“I felt very strongly that young women were interested in politics, and could talk about it as intelligently as they could about fashion, often within the same hour,” Holmes said.
Dunst was offering an opinion from her personal experience as to what makes her feel happy and fulfilled as a woman. Refusing to honor her statements and calling them “dumb” apparently constitutes talking about the issue of gender “intelligently.” Jezebel’s discourse harms the cause of actual feminism, which should seek to protect all women, regardless of their personal theories on happiness — not just the ones who further their (rather profitable) editorial agenda.
Dunst’s comments are rooted in her personal reality. The actress does not claim to bear the cross of the feminist gospel — she’s an exceptional professional in her field who believes that there is merit to the way her mother raised her, and that traditionally established gender roles create a helpful sense of structure when it comes to maintaining expectations in personal relationships.
The reality is that women have a right to refuse to marry if they feel it interferes with their ambitions. Dunst is not saying that women ought to “Wife the F— Out,” as Ryan asserted in her headline, and Dunst’s assertion that the feminine is undervalued in contemporary society is only validated by Jezebel’s dismissal. Are women who desire to fill a traditional, domestic gender role supposed to feel intellectually inferior or socially stigmatized as detractors of the feminist cause?
This is precisely the notion Jezebel and Ryan seem to be engendering through such a response. At its worst, the publication pushes a false dichotomy, separating and galvanizing the pro-“feminist” from the “uneducated” traditionalist masses. This type of partisan discourse creates unbridgeable gaps and a reluctance to get the opposition to compromise. Sound familiar? Maybe that’s because it’s the same method that the U.S. Congress recently used to negotiate controversial legislation such as the Affordable Care Act. And in case you’re wondering, Gallup’s latest Congressional approval ratings are at 13 percent.
The best way to advance the cause of feminism is to educate and inform Americans about existing social and economic inequalities between the genders. This is most effectively accomplished through meaningful, constructive discourse which takes into account the opinions of all women, including those who disagree with parts, or all, of the feminist movement. But Dunst’s comments about her personal preferences and opinions seem to be, for writers such as Ryan, a justifiable motivation for ideological bigotry.
Dismissing someone’s opinion on account of the fact that she isn’t “paid to write about gender theory” is plenty of fun for those who buy into Jezebel’s particular brand of feminism — in Ryan’s article, it’s a fleeting catharsis of arrogance, crassness and feigned outrage — but the only women really benefitting from the feminist cause in this emotionally manipulative way seems to be female members of the Gawker Media family and Jezebel founder Anna Holmes.

weird.  my comment from a few days ago disappeared.
Feminism is a mess, and Jezebel is one of the poster children for the mess that is feminism.
You have to marvel at how genuinely, perpetually miserable people like Erin Gloria Ryan must be. And to call someone “dumb” about a borderline fictitious topic like “gender theory” is pure insanity.
There is and always will be a difference between men and women. It’s a good thing and has allowed us to thrive as a species for 300,000 years. Sorry “feminists”
Gender is a social construct, according to feminism.
The greatest enemy of women are feminists. Thank you feminism, women have no choices.

“So, why did you join a white sorority?”
Since becoming a member of Gamma Phi Beta, I’ve been asked this question numerous times by family, friends and even random people on campus. Without asking me about going to football games, raising money for charity or getting ready for a night out with my sisters, my entire sorority experience gets boiled down to the fact that I’m a black girl in a “white” sorority.
When I decided to go through formal recruitment the fall of my freshman year, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The only image I had of The Row was offered by the criminally underrated television show Greek.
I had a bit more knowledge about the African American Greek experience — my mother is one of 16, so you can bet that I have plenty of aunts who belong to one of the many illustrious black sororities in the country. But honestly, when I came to school in the fall of 2010, I had no intention of going Greek at all. I ended up rushing because everyone else was “doing it.” I wasn’t expecting to join a house — I thought I could eat some food, see some pretty houses and go on my merry way.
Obviously, my plans changed after a few fateful encounters. Without getting too hackneyed and emotional, I quickly found that Gamma Phi Beta was a perfect fit for me. I was offered a bid, accepted it and spent a great four years as part of a sisterhood.
I don’t think I can blame my ever-questioning aunts, however, for thinking that I followed the white light — pun intended. But whenever I’ve wanted to debate someone older about how the world has changed, I try to remember his or her childhood. When my aunts were in college, traditional — code word for Caucasian — sororities were exactly that: organizations filled with Caucasian women. Though my aunts rushed their respective sororities after the years of legal segregation, there were still psychological barriers between races, and old wounds that had yet to be healed. My aunts didn’t get to choose what sorority experience they wanted — they had one option, and went with it.
Nowadays, of course, it’s a little bit different. I grew up not in a segregated neighborhood, but in a racially mixed private community. My parents had good jobs, I went to private school and I was accepted into USC. My best friends in high school were Asian, black, Latina, Catholic, Jewish, gay, musical-loving, sports-playing weirdos. My prom pictures looked like a United Nations conference.
So when I got to USC, it’s not like I was afraid of going through Panhellenic recruitment because I was black. I’ve always been black, I will always be black — so what?
This sentiment is shared by other minority members of the Greek community. Ryan Park, the outgoing USG vice president and a member of Sigma Chi, grew up on military bases in Japan and South Korea before moving to San Diego, Calif. in middle school. Growing up, Park never wanted to feel like “the token Asian.” He played on his high school’s varsity lacrosse team for four years, thinking it was one of the most “American” things he could do.
Upon entering college, Park had a friend at USC who claimed that he would be perfect for the Greek system. After rushing, Park felt a connection with Sigma Chi, which was full of “good guys” who were “a little bit goofy,” and he wanted to get to know better — pure and simple.
“To me, when you see all the Asian kids hanging out together, I’m sure that’s very comfortable and very fine for them but for me, I wouldn’t want to do that because I don’t want to play into stereotypes,” Park said. “I don’t necessarily culturally fit with [the Asian demographic]. I don’t listen to K-Pop, I’m not very Korean, I wouldn’t be able to stay in a conversation with someone over time. I went where it felt comfortable.”
Trevian Hall, a sophomore majoring in acting who’s a member of Phi Delta Theta, has had a mostly positive experience in an IFC fraternity. The only difficulty he found in adjusting to Greek life is the fact that he grew up in a different environment in Texas.
“Because I am black and I did grow up in a different environment than they did, I just don’t relate the same way,” Hall said. “I could be black and relate. But I don’t think it’s a negative thing, I just think it’s something to add to the melting pot.”
Sherryl Bako, a senior majoring in communication and a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, feels the same way. Bako moved from Nigeria to Orange County, Calif. during her childhood. Apart from a few humorous instances — including one in which some of her sorority sisters asked if she could cornrow their hair — Bako has never felt uncomfortable about her experience.
“I knew I was probably going to look different or be the only black person on the wall, but I’ve never really felt uncomfortable because growing up, I was usually the one black girl in the class,” Bako said.
People join fraternities and sororities for different reasons. A select few solely want to party or live in pretty houses. But most of us want a brotherhood or sisterhood, a home away from home — a place to study, laugh, hang out.
I have a rather vivid memory from my sophomore year: I went out with my Big, and we were hanging out in a fraternity house across the street. I locked eyes with one of the brothers. We laughed and said, “So, does your family hate you too?” and toasted to being black on this strange street called The Row.
So why did I join a “white” sorority? I decided to join because I thought there was a place for me. I don’t consider myself whitewashed and I’m not running away from my ethnicity. My experiences have only added to the diversity of the house, the same way that my sisters have showed me what it’s like to be Christian, to be Mexican, or to actually be from Las Vegas. I joined because when I walked into Gamma Phi, I felt the same feeling I got when I first stepped foot on USC’s campus during a tour: butterflies.
“I’ve had a little backlash, people saying that you’re leaving your people. My people are humans,” Bako told me. “Human is human — no matter what.”

For students intrigued by Asian-interest Greek life, USC is home to two Asian fraternities and three sororities that make up USC’s Asian Greek Council. All five participate in social and philanthropic events with each other and with Asian-interest and minority groups both on- and off-campus.
These fraternities and sororities seek to offer an alternative Greek experience, including formal social events, philanthropies and networking opportunities to the 23 percent of students who make up the Asian population at USC. Though their mixers and events tend to remain within the AGC, they host multiple campus-wide events and strive to be a visible and contributing part of USC Greek life.
With 150 total members, the AGC doesn’t boast the size of the Interfraternity Council at USC. Its heavy involvement with Asian-interest organizations throughout Southern California, however, allows its members to enjoy a diverse range of activities and provides a fully immersive Greek experience.
“[The AGC] is definitely not as big as IFC; there are only five houses so it’s a pretty tight-knit community,” said Aaron Liu, a sophomore majoring in chemistry and the AGC representative for Beta Omega Phi. “The benefit of AGC is that every week we meet organizations from different schools for exchanges and other events.”
The two fraternities, Beta Omega Phi and Gamma Epsilon Omega, have been at USC since 1988 and 1963, respectively. The members of Beta Omega Phi, or “Betas,” were previously the only minority organization on campus to have a house on The Row until the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu replaced them last year. Though they’re no longer on The Row, they have continued as active members of AGC.
Though the sororities and fraternities that make up the AGC have active social components, members are also involved in cultural events throughout Southern California. For example, Beta and its sister sorority, Sigma Phi Omega, have placed in the top three for the past three years in the Southern California Asian Greek Council Talent Show for both song and dance performances.
“If you’re looking for a cultural aspect to Greek life, this is where you’re going to find it,” Liu said.
Gamma Epsilon Omega, the members of which founded the original Southern California Asian Greek Council in 1982, is the oldest Asian-interest fraternity in Southern California. Although they too have a sister sorority, Delta Phi Kappa, the members of the AGC emphasize that all five houses mingle regularly.
“It’s different in terms of the numbers — each girl knows each sister. We have a lot more interaction on a closer level,” said Amy Yee, a member of Delta Phi Kappa and president of the AGC. “We do a lot of social events, and we don’t stay just within USC. It’s great to get to know other sororities and fraternities throughout SoCal.”
This close community also offers networking and service opportunities, and members are encouraged to branch out and get involved on campus.
“Every year we do alumni tea, where we invite alumni to mingle with actives,” Yee said. “It’s really rewarding to see all these different members come together, and hear what alumni have to say.”
Alpha Delta Kappa, another sorority, is unique in that it is an “open” sorority — that is, it allows students from other universities throughout Southern California to join. This both bolsters membership and further integrates the sorority into Southern California’s Asian-American community.
For the other four houses, rush is a two-week process in which houses alternate their planned events to allow potential new members to really get a sense of where they belong at USC. Prospective members are encouraged to attend rush events at other fraternities and sororities, both IFC and AGC.
“As a senior, it’s really rewarding to see younger members find their place,” Yee said. “[Delta Phi Kappa] has been a really significant part of my experience, and I feel I’ve learned a lot about all aspects of my life.”

In recent years, college athletics and Greek life have slowly drifted apart. Two worlds that used to coexist smoothly have been separated by the advancing pressures of being a student-athlete — from yearlong practice schedules to ever-present social media.
According to Bloomberg Sports, there has been a 19 percent drop in fraternity alumni in the NFL since 2003. This has been tied to the shrinking number of college coaches who even allow their players to go Greek — a pattern that extends, on a smaller scale, to sports outside of football. Most of these coaches are very aware of the risks inherent in fraternity and sorority life, brought to light now more than ever by advancing technology.
Even at USC, a school historically tied to both high-profile athletics and a strong Greek community, this trend has not been absent. For many athletes, juggling a full course load and the responsibilities of sports with the demands of Greek life is just too much. Still, even as maintaining this balance becomes more difficult than ever, many USC athletes are proud and active members of the Greek community.
This strong but relatively small group includes Robby Kolanz, a redshirt sophomore wide receiver on the Trojan football team and a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Kolanz recognizes the difficulty of his undertaking, but is appreciative of the fraternity experience.
“Obviously I can’t do all the things that my friends in the house can,” Kolanz said. “I don’t have the freedom that they do. But I think it’s a cool balance because I have all my friends here on the football team, and I also have a whole other group of friends.”
Soma Vainuku, a redshirt junior fullback and a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, also spoke highly of the friendships he has made in Greek life.
“To tell you the truth, when I get some spare time I just try to spend it with my Greek buds,” Vainuku said. “Actually a lot of the time I just hang out with them at school, and after school, too, when I’m done with practice.”
Kolanz is aware of the stereotypical reputation that fraternities can have in the outside world, but is quick to point out that there are plenty of legitimate reasons to participate in Greek life.
“I think I do it for the right things,” the Palos Verdes, Calif. native said. “Not necessarily going and getting drunk every night, but maybe just going to dinner at the house and participating in the events that I can to balance things out.”
This idea of balance is crucial to student-athletes, especially those who participate in Greek life. Elizabeth Eddy, a senior on USC’s soccer and lacrosse teams and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, knows this better than anyone.
“It’s definitely a lot to handle,” Eddy said. “But it has also helped me balance my life. I just try to be the best sorority sister I can be and the best athlete I can be and enjoy it all.”
Junior wide receiver Christian Tober, another member of Sigma Chi, knows he has not chosen an easy path.
“Balancing school and sports and being in a fraternity is not easy,” Tober said. “My freshman year was the hardest, because I was pledging the fraternity, and it was my first year at school so I was basically pledging the football team.”
Still, Tober is appreciative of the lessons he has learned in Greek life.
“It was a big time commitment, and I just had to work on scheduling everything,” the San Clemente, Calif. native said. “There were times when I had to give up things just to get stuff done, but it was a good learning tool.”
Though their experiences in Greek life have been positive, USC athletes know that they must tread carefully when participating in social events. Any evidence of underage drinking or other illegal behavior could put their athletic futures in jeopardy. Kolanz knows the responsibility that comes with his position.
“Without a doubt, I think whether you’re [Cody] Kessler or the last guy on the team, when you play for the ’SC football team, you put yourself in a different aspect of this university,” Kolanz said. “It’s actually something that I’m really proud of, and I want to be a good representation of the house.”
Tober, Kolanz’s teammate and fraternity brother, agreed.
“I don’t drink, so that helps me out a lot off the field,” he said. “I don’t have [to] worry about getting in pictures or doing anything stupid. But I’m also looking out for my brothers and my teammates that I see out and about.”
Vainuku emphasized the tradition of USC athletics. “[We’ve] got a reputation to uphold, the brand and the ’SC logo, and you can’t really mess it up or anything,” the Eureka, Calif. native said. “When I go out I’m representing the house, the football team and the school as well.”
The life of a college athlete is extraordinarily different from that of the average student. From grueling workouts in the early hours of the morning to long road trips, nothing about the experiences of Kolanz, Tober, Vainuku or Eddy have been typical. And though their participation in Greek life can be stressful and risky, they are truly making the most of their four years at USC. Eddy was frank in her evaluation of Greek life.
“Being an athlete has made my experience in a sorority very different,” she said. “But it’s the best decision I’ve made in college.”

At first glance, the prominent party culture that clouds stereotypes of the Greek community at USC wouldn’t seem to align with many religious values. Students of various faiths, however, have found a religious home in the Greek system.
For Lazarus Alberto, a junior majoring in business administration, his involvement in Alpha Gamma Omega, a Christ-centered fraternity, has helped him strengthen his faith. Through his involvement in AGO, Alberto said he has been able to participate in events that all other fraternities in the Interfraternity Council take part in, such as sorority philanthropies, mixers and Songfest, while still maintaining his Christian values.
“I don’t feel like I miss out on my faith by being in the Greek system, because while our house is different from many other houses, we also participate in events like [sorority philanthropies],” he said. “We can be involved [in] certain things on The Row and choose to not involve ourselves in other things.”
Alberto said sticking to his faith has never been a struggle for him, but he knows the culture of The Row has made it difficult for others trying to sustain a Christian lifestyle. One reason he joined AGO was because it provided him the opportunity to stay religious while still allowing him to be Greek.
“There are definitely temptations for people trying to live [up] to certain ideals while everything around you is contrary, so it can be a challenge,” Alberto said. “For me, it hasn’t been my biggest struggle, but I do know Christians in other houses that it is a struggle for, so we try to be a resource and offer alternatives.”
Alberto said he and other AGO brothers often offer advice to those who approach them about this struggle and also invite them to join in alternatives to drinking, such as “mocktail” parties and weekly Bible study.
Christian sorority Alpha Delta Chi provides women with a similar experience. In fact, the two houses often plan events together, said President Stephanie Nakamura.
Yet for other houses affiliated with a religion, faith is just the guiding principal of the house and plays a very different role. Houses, such as Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau and Zeta Beta Tau, are all historically Jewish houses rather than nationally Jewish, meaning they maintain Jewish values and programs but do not have a quota for Jewish members.
SDT  thrives off of this opportunity for diversity.
“SDT was founded because seven Jewish women were discriminated against and could not join a sorority, so we honor our Jewish roots, but we are also very dedicated to not discriminating against people of any other faith, and have one of the most culturally and religiously diverse houses on The Row,” said SDT President Clara Hua.
About half of SDT’s members are Jewish, but there are also many practicing Christians in the house who hold weekly Bible study, as well as members of other religions, Hua said.
To honor SDT’s Jewish tradition, the house does have an affiliation with USC Chabad and Hillel; girls of all faiths and backgrounds, however, are welcome to participate in events for Jewish holidays or traditions.
Hua, who is not Jewish, said she has always felt welcomed in Jewish activities and has used the opportunity to learn about a culture different from her own.
“This year, I’m going to Passover, and all of our girls usually go whether they are Jewish or not. It’s really cool to see different things and it’s super welcoming,” Hua said.
Sam Jacobson, president of Alpha Epsilon Pi, said his house has a similar inclusiveness, despite the fact that it is a nationally Jewish fraternity.
“Technically everyone is supposed to be Jewish, but if we don’t have an all-Jewish pledge class, we can usually work things out with nationals because we’re happy being a Jewish fraternity, but there are also kids that we love [who] aren’t Jewish that we want in the house, so USC is a little different from other [AEPi national] chapters,” Jacobson said.
Jacobson, who is half Greek Orthodox and half Jewish, said his background has helped him relate to the Jewish members of the house, as well as those of other faiths, especially when it comes to celebrating Jewish holidays and events within the chapter.
“It’s fun watching our friends learn about what traditions we grew up with, and I think a lot of the guys who aren’t Jewish enjoy it too because when all your friends are a part of something, you want to be a part of it too. For example, some of the guys who aren’t Jewish came to Passover with us last year and come to Shabbat events,” he said.
Though religious Greek houses at USC are currently limited to Jewish and Christian houses, a Muslim fraternity, Alpha Lambda Mu, was founded last year at the University of Texas, Dallas. It now has three operating chapters across the country.
“I think that the emerging content of Muslim sororities and fraternities is a natural progression. These groups are being formed by Muslim students seeking a sense of belonging, and establishing formalized sisterhood and brotherhood with peer groups,” said Ali Mir, director of Muslim Student Life at USC.
According to Mir, when he was an undergraduate student in the late ’90s, he knew a few Muslim men and women who were members of secular Greek life. He said these students felt welcomed in their houses, but primarily because they did not identify themselves as outwardly practicing Muslims. For other Muslims, he said, joining a secular Greek organization may not be a viable option.
Regardless of faith, for many members of the Greek community joining a sorority or a fraternity is about finding a supportive group of peers with common values, and religion can play a varying degree of importance.
“It’s really about being with good company,” Jacobson said.

Bree Humphery, a senior majoring in East Asian Languages and Culture, along with a group of a few other women challenged herself to live off of 20 dollars for the week. Throughout that week, she troubleshooted and thought of ways to extend and switch up bland yet inexpensive meals to achieve her goal — one that was made by choice.
Humphery’s challenge was part of her sorority’s initiative to educate people about the food stamp program. Humphery said this challenge is just one of the many service-oriented activities her sorority — Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. — does each year.
Yet because of the small number of members in Humphery’s black sorority — there are only four current active members on campus — and in the National Pan-Hellenic Council compared to the larger number of members in USC’s Panhellenic and Interfraternity Councils, Humphery feels like she is often making efforts to educate students on campus about her sorority and its aims.
At USC, NPHC takes on a different character than at historically black colleges and universities. Here, NPHC chapters focus on making a presence on campus with programming and events, yet they still have all of the demands and expectations of providing social and service-oriented events to the student body and surrounding community. With the relatively small number of active NPHC members on campus, the students in NPHC fraternities and sororities are looking to rebrand themselves and black Greek life on campus as they move forward in the coming years.
 
 
REDEFINING THE YARD
 
Skylar Dunn, a junior majoring in business administration, is president and had been one of four members in the Alpha Delta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. Since the probate, or coming-out ceremony for new members of a fraternity or sorority, on March 28, the chapter has gained seven new members. The chapter membership now totals 11, which is the largest number of members since 2008.
Dunn said because of the smaller size of black Greek life on campus, fraternities and sororities must work in conjunction with one another, which is not necessarily the case at HBCUs. The NPHC fraternities share their chapters with nearby colleges, such as Loyola Marymount and Cal State Los Angeles, while the charters for historically black sororities are solely confined to USC’s campus.
“One thing I’ve been really adamant about here at USC is NPHC unity because we don’t have the strength in numbers to be divided,” Dunn said.
Despite the differences in personalities and histories of the nine NPHC sororities and fraternities, many members said that “The Yard” had to be redefined. The Yard is both the geographical and intangible community of black Greeks on campus.
At USC, there are six of the nine NPHC Greek letter organizations. According to Rayven Vinson, president of National Panhellenic Council at USC, Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. has not chartered a chapter on the University Park Campus. Furthermore, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority are currently inactive.
“It’s not easy to see the black Greek letter organizations here on campus,” said De’Ron Marques, a senior majoring in public relations, and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. “Yet because I knew I wanted to be Greek before I got into college, that’s why I decided to seek them out and ultimately become a member.”
 
SERVICE OVER STROLLING
 
The NPHC organizations are immersed in history and tradition. When they were originally founded in the early 1900s, they focused on creating unity and service among the black community on campus and in the surrounding area. Furthermore, at the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of black students were not allowed to join other fraternities or sororities within Panhellenic and IFC.
“To have these fraternity brothers behind you and be there to support you in times of need and happiness is powerful,” Marques said.
Off campus, service activities, which are largely rooted in reaching out to high school students and the elderly, help establish solidarity among the black Greek letter organizations.
“When you have 10 or less people in the chapter, it forces you to concentrate your skills and makes you more willing to work,” Marques said.
On top of the service component, a main tradition within the NPHC is stepping and strolling, particularly at parties and probates. Stepping is a series of movements that use hands and feet to create a rhythm. Strolling is a series of dance moves while in line, consisting of movements and dance moves that are done in unison among members of a particular fraternity or sorority. Students interviewed for this story said both methods are used as a channel for self-expression and an outlet to represent their organization’s values and character.
“There are countless amount of times where people want us to go to their events just to stroll and step,” Humphery said. “But we do so much with service and scholarship that we want to promote and let people know about.”
 
REBRANDING FOR VISIBILITY
 
Many NPHC members said that before arriving at USC, they were interested in joining a black Greek letter organization. Many, however, recognized there could be higher visibility of  NPHC on campus.
Students involved in NPHC believe many misconceptions can arise when the majority of students on campus are not involved in black Greek life or do not see the other activities that NPHC members participate in outside of social events.
“We don’t have the funds like that to be able to throw all of those parties,” Dunn said. “So we’re more like a business, I would say, at least here at USC’s campus, because we’re trying to rebuild our brand right now.”
Despite the differences in black Greek life and the challenges that are associated with it, members of NPHC have a pride and dedication to their organization and fellow brothers and sisters, as well as a passion to improve the campus and the surrounding community.
“We’ve shown excellence and leadership and really roll up our sleeves and do hard work,” Humphery said when referring to her sorority and other NPHC organizations on The Yard. “It’s evident within the community because people respect us. I appreciate the presence we’ve had on this campus.”

Though many Greek organizations emphasize brotherhood, sisterhood, service and scholarship, the pre-professional fraternities that make up the Professional Fraternity Council have a central focus on the professional development of their members.
PFC governs the four pre-professional fraternities that exist under the council: Alpha Epsilon Delta, the pre-med fraternity; Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity; Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law fraternity; and Sigma Phi Delta, the engineering fraternity. But USC is known to have additional professional fraternities that are not within PFC, with focuses including leadership, architecture, cinema and accounting.
One of the two business fraternities on campus, Alpha Kappa Psi demonstrates how chapter requirements vary from fraternity to fraternity.
Unlike its counterpart Delta Sigma Pi, which is known for only accepting accounting, business, economic or international relations (global business) majors, AKP accepts students of all academic backgrounds and focuses on more general skills, no matter the member’s desired career path.
“Our program provides students with the soft skills of business not learned in class, for example, how to write a resume or how to do a cover letter,” said AKP President Sam Loke. “During the pledge program, you are exposed to different kinds of workshops — public speaking, how to do a case competition, debate. We offer very concrete, hands-on activities and events. [New members] don’t just learn the theory of it — they also have to execute it.”
Though the application and recruitment process for professional fraternities varies from chapter to chapter, it’s typical for the fraternities to require an application and an interview.
Alpha Kappa Psi’s process includes an additional weeklong rush process that includes meeting with the chapter as well as attending a professional workshop, an alumni panel about the pledging process and benefits of active membership and a social event. Rush is completed with an interview and potentially the offering of a bid.
Professional fraternities look for a variety of characteristics in their potential new members.
“What I look for is someone who is very eager to learn,” Loke said. “The chapter wants pledges who are looking for a sense of brotherhood, someone who comes in on day one and at the end of the process has gone through personal and professional development. We do emphasize personal development a lot, a lot of self-reflection — working on a team and then reflecting on your role and how you can better yourself when you work in another team.”
Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law fraternity, is another participating member of PFC that welcomes students of all majors and grade levels. Though the organization’s focus is professional, members also attend football games together and host social events. Students do not have to be positive they want a career in law to be a part of the fraternity, and many use this group as an opportunity to learn more about the field.
PAD has guest speakers who range from test prep company representatives advising on how to prepare for the LSAT to current law students and professors discussing life during law school to lawyers from different fields who give examples of the many areas of law.
“We always try to have one speaker a semester come in and talk about other options similar to law but not necessarily law,” said junior Jordan Gary, secretary of PAD. “As we like to say, PAD is kind of a place to figure out if law school is right for you. I’m really interested in sports law, and PAD definitely helped me figure that out.”
Gary said she was inspired by a talk given by an entertainment lawyer who discussed how one of his colleagues worked for the Dodgers during their owner transfer.
“This made me realize that was an avenue available to me,” Gary said.
Engineering fraternity membership requirements are different — Sigma Phi Delta only accepts undergraduate Viterbi School of Engineering students.
Junior Ashtyn Chen, former SPD secretary, said many of their activities involve networking with alumni so it is critical that members are actually interested in working in that field.
“A bunch of our alumni are at Boeing, Tesla, Intel, you name it — all of them come back and tell us about opportunities,” said Chen. “This semester, we have a friend who works at Microsoft, and he came down and set up all the Hackathons down in Long Beach, and we basically [brought] Microsoft Hackathon down here.”
Though many of the engineering firms are not immediately located in Los Angeles, the alumni connection brings them back to home base.
“A lot of alumni still come by because Boeing is down in Long Beach, Chevron is down in [El] Segundo,” Chen said. “A lot of companies are in this area. The house sponsors bowling events and going to Six Flags — trying to integrate the young people with the alumni. The connection base is very good.”
In addition to helping students get a foot in the door job-wise, professional fraternities offer a system of support for its members outside of the classroom or the office.
“Everyone who rushes Alpha Kappa Psi has a different reason,” Loke said. “It could be wanting to gain a brotherhood or sense of family, or network the opportunities because our alumni is pretty strong within the L.A. region, in terms of investment banking, consulting, marketing and so on and so forth. It really depends on the individual and what they want to get out of it.”
Though he joined as a freshman after realizing that few of his friends held the same academic interests he did, Chen said the fraternity has become much more than a group of students who share professional goals.
“It’s very rare for me to find people in my major, so I came out for a barbeque during rush week,” Chen said. “I met a lot of the brothers here, and they all seemed chill. It feels more like a family than this club that meets every week to fulfill an agenda. We actually care about the success of each one of us.”
As with any large organization, professional fraternities are not immune to misconceptions — one of which, Gary said, is that there’s no difference between them and the other Greek organizations.
“They have that stigma that all they do is party. I personally don’t think that’s all that [IFC] fraternities are — I think they do a lot more for the USC community — so that’s a bad stigma to get, but I think we get caught up in it when it definitely does not apply to us.”
One aspect of the IFC fraternities and Panhellenic sororities Gary admires is their strong sense of community.
“I’d like to see [professional fraternities] come together as a group more,” Gary said. “I think that we could do philanthropies — maybe not necessarily go out to the soccer field and play soccer drunk every Friday — but I think we could definitely make it fun and group-oriented. I think all of the professional fraternities, even though they each have their different focuses, all serve the same general purpose for their members.”

When the average person thinks of Greek life on a college campus, images of togas, beer pong tables and raging house parties often come to mind. These stigmas and stereotypes can be hard to break, but Greek leaders on campus strive to show that their work is more than just one big party.
“You always have the typical fraternity and sorority stereotypes — like drinking, too much partying and sexual assault,” said Austin Horton, vice president of communications for the USC Interfraternity Council. “But I think they’re very much overgeneralizations over things that happen so few times that it’s unfair for people to generalize [Greek life] that way.”
Sometimes, however, it can be hard to separate myth from reality. In the past academic year, the reputation of USC Greek life has suffered some major setbacks. Last October, a non-USC student sustained life-threatening injuries at a Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity party after falling off a table, and that same weekend four people were medically transported for alcohol-related reasons from The Row.
Following what Student Affairs characterized as “the worst weekend of the semester,” campus administrators put SAE on social probation and placed harsh sanctions on all of campus Greek life.
Since then, fraternity and sorority leaders have worked hard to patch up their damaged image, hoping to squash any negative stereotypes that could thrive in such an environment.
“[The Interfraternity Council] has been working to have it never be an issue where it needs to go to [campus administration],” said Aaron Goldwyn, president of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. “We can handle our own business. I think a lot of times in the past IFC houses have turned a blind eye, and we realized now it’s not a sustainable strategy.”
Horton and Goldwyn noted that IFC is currently working on developing an updated risk management manual, as well as implementing student emergency medical technicians to respond to Row-related medical emergencies instead of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Katherine Grabar, president of the Panhellenic Council, declined to comment on the matter.
Kimberly Ostiller, president of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, told the Daily Trojan that the Panhellenic Council has also been working to institute updated, precautionary measures in light of the recent setbacks.
“[The sororities are] working together [with campus administration,] talking to DPS, seeing how we can better improve the situation on 28th Street, making it safer for our Trojans as well as making it safer for any visitors who might be coming to campus,” Ostiller said.
Their mission, however, is often made difficult by the outside community’s preconceived notions about Greek life.
“[Stereotypes] absolutely hinder the Greek community,” Goldwyn said. “I think the Greek community is a great opportunity for anyone that gets involved in it. I have never met a person that has regretted joining a fraternity or sorority, and it sucks when people are turned off by, ‘Oh, I don’t fit that stereotype, so I won’t do it.’”
Ostiller asserted that negative portrayals of the Greek community are often based off false opinions from those outside of the Greek system, as well as media coverage that only highlights the negative.
“I think a lot of the stories that have been published recently … have not been the most positive involving incidents on 28th Street,” Ostiller said. “That’s an outside agency that’s viewing the Greek system differently. There are some not-supported rumors that are circulating, and I think some of the stereotypes — if you were to look into them — do not have a backing.”
Greek leaders on campus hope to stress the benefits of their organizations that many who are independent of Greek life don’t recognize, such as fundraising and philanthropic efforts.
“No one realizes what good the Greek community does because they dwell on the bad things,” Horton said. “Some of the biggest philanthropies are donated from Greek organizations and a lot of volunteers come from Greeks.”
Ostiller agreed, stressing that the prevalence of fundraising in the USC Greek system is one of its biggest assets.
“I think that the amount of philanthropies and philanthropic work and fundraising for all these several charities is phenomenal,” Ostiller said. “The work of philanthropy is very prevalent … There are several philanthropic events every single week.”
The fundraising claims are not without merit. According to the USC office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, USC Greek life raises more than $300,000 a year for local and national causes, as well as hosts multiple fundraising and community service opportunities occurring every month.
But not everyone within in the Greek system is on the same page when it comes to The Row’s philanthropic efforts. Brendan Dugan, vice president of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, noted Greek philanthropies, specifically among fraternities, often lack the community service aspect.
“The whole philanthropy idea at USC with fraternities is everyone pays a certain amount of money to a house who then gives it to their [respective] philanthropy, but [fraternity members] don’t go out and really help anyone,” Dugan said. “They have these [fundraising] events where there is usually drinking involved, and they’re sort of just competitive events.”
Goldwyn agreed that this idea of philanthropies as a front for alcohol-related events is not completely false. He stressed, however, that one should take fraternities on a case-by-case basis rather than lumping them into a single mindset.
“The USC jargon of philanthropy is kind of like a bad disguise for a day party — ‘We’re giving money but let’s all get hammered,’” Goldwyn said. “I think that maybe some houses do that, but I think a lot of houses also go out into the community and do service.”
This sense of disunity on The Row has contributed to the prevalence of another common Greek stereotype — house rankings.
“There is definitely an air about [ranking],” Dugan said. “People know there is supposedly a hierarchy.”
The idea of comparing houses is, for the most part, an unofficial phenomenon, but its hold over people’s mentalities can be strong. Goldwyn mentioned for some within the Greek system, the perceived prestigiousness of a house — or its “rank” — can be its main allure.
“Some people really buy into [house rankings] and they thrive in it and love it,” Goldwyn said. “When I was a freshman, that was the be-all, end-all.”
Nevertheless, others within the Greek community stress it isn’t an issue and hope to disprove this mentality entirely.
“Individual people definitely consider [house rankings] because I think everyone obviously has their favorite house, or maybe a house that they dislike, but overall I don’t think it plays a big part,” Horton said.
Ostiller said house ranking among sororities is a subject she rarely hears about — something that came as a surprise to her.
“I personally haven’t been aware of much discussion of ranking,” Ostiller said. “From my experience, it has not been as much of a discussion as I thought it might be.”
As is common with all stereotypes, it is tough to say which aspects are fact and which are myth. But one thing is clear: Greek members are not simply a homogenous set of affluent partygoers, but rather a diverse array of students who represent multiple walks of life. If this notion were better understood, stereotypes would soon crumble.
“The biggest misconception I would try to address is that Greek life is for a very specific kind of person … I could not disagree with that more,” Goldwyn said. “The best part of my Greek experience has been how diverse the people that I’ve met are. I think that if you’re interested in Greek life, check it out, because immediately you’re going to see it’s different from what Animal House makes it out to be.”

When Rocio Arellano began her freshman year at USC in spring 2013, she didn’t know anyone. Worse yet, she was a spring admit and it seemed everyone had made friends already. Arellano came to USC certain she didn’t want to join a Panhellenic sorority, but she always wanted an older sister.
“I have [younger] sisters so I wanted someone who was older than me to give me advice, do my hair and help me with things,” Arellano said.
A friend she met at orientation heard about the multicultural Greek community — which Arellano said includes 12 fraternities and sororities that represent different cultural identities and has approximately 80 members — and recommended she attend an interest meeting for one of the Latina sororities on campus.
The process of joining many of the Latina sororities and Latino fraternities is different than the rush process for the Panhellenic system. They often require that students be classified as an “interest” for a semester before deciding to begin the formal pledge process.
“For a semester or more they get to know us as brothers, as friends,” said Community Service Chair of Lambda Theta Phi Jorge Calderon. “We become closer with them and it’s like a sneak peek into what being a brother would be like.”
Students who are “interests” help plan community service and academic events for the fraternity of their choosing.
Unlike the Interfraternity Council houses, which can have anywhere from 60-200 members, most Latina sororities and Latino fraternities at USC have fewer than 10 active members in each chapter. Pledge classes typically consist of three to five students. The groups become very close and often feel they are closer as brothers than their IFC peers.
“The one thing that really kept me going was bonding with these guys,” said Bryan Sandoval, vice president of USC’s chapter of Lambda Theta Phi. “I was hanging out with them all the time; I was really knowing them on a beyond-surface level. We developed a bond that was beyond associating by letters; we were actually associated by similar experiences.”
Because of their small size, Latina sororities and Latino fraternities have difficulty funding both academic and social events. Arellano added that an appealing factor of the Latino Greek community is that the dues are substantially lower compared to the dues of the IFC system. Latino Greek organizations are considered more affordable for students, but the small size of the system coupled with the less expensive dues means less funding over all.
Calderon said the Latina/o Greek community tends to be smaller because the number of Latino students on campus is smaller, particularly when compared to the larger public universities in Southern California.
The interest and pledge process caters to smaller pledge classes. Latino fraternity Sigma Delta Alpha, however, does a rush week similar to the IFC process. As a result, this fraternity tends to recruit more members.
Calderon said one of the major myths of the Latina/o Greek community is that you have to be of Latin heritage to join.
“Recently in my fraternity we’ve been branching out, trying to recruit people that are not of Latino heritage,” he said. “One of my interests right now, he’s actually Italian and he just loves the Latino culture. The Latina sororities and Latino fraternities refer to themselves as ‘Latin by tradition but not by definition.’”
For Arellano, who went to a high school that was 99 percent Latino, becoming part of Lambda Theta Alpha was an easy choice.
The pledge process, however, has been described as extremely taxing.
A current pledge who wished to remain anonymous said that she was required to give her sorority sisters her class and work schedule, and when she is not in class or at work she has to be willing to attend a meeting at any time. She is required to devote 15 hours each week to studying in addition to pledge activities and had to drop a class in order to keep up with her many obligations.
Both the pledges and the current members, however, said that the difficulty of the pledge process is an essential part of forming such a close bond and that many of the pledge processes and activities that are time-consuming are deeply rooted in tradition.
Lambda Theta Phi’s mascot is the conquistador. Sandoval explained this icon is also largely symbolic of the pledge process.
“It represents the journey of the conquistador leaving the old land, which would be our old selves, and conquering that new land, which is learning and developing that new gentleman we want to become,” he said.
Adrian Mendoza, member of the Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity, said he rushed an IFC fraternity but ultimately decided not to pledge because he wanted to become more in touch with his Latino cultural heritage.
He stressed the unique experience of the Latino fraternities as they focus largely on family, academics and community service. He said getting to know the families of the brothers as well as the brothers themselves is a distinct difference from other organizations.
“We believe in looking upon your family’s history and heritage and finding strength in that,” Mendoza said. “You have your family and you have your fraternity brothers and they get blended together.”
One of the many unique traditions of the Latina sororities and Latino fraternities is saluting, which comes from the militaristic traditions of organizations such as Lambda Theta Phi and Lambda Theta Alpha. Calderon describes this militaristic performance as poetry in motion. Members march and stomp and also include chants unique to each organization. Saluting is often used in the process of presenting new members.
Becoming a member of a Latina/o organization creates opportunities to learn about one’s culture and share it with other students.
Additionally, the potential for growth within the Latina sororities and Latino fraternities at USC is apparent. Arellano, who is now president of her chapter, said being part of the organization has increased her confidence and leadership skills.
“I’ve always been a really shy girl and now I’ve learned how to take on leadership roles and how not to be scared to actually push for what you want,” she said. “I was always scared of speaking in front of people. Saluting in front of a crowd of 200 people would have terrified me before, but not anymore.”
Editor’s note: This post and the headline have been updated.
I agree with Monica that this does not full represent MGC. It is also somewhat misleading to refer to MGC as the “Latino Greek community.” MGC is not solely compsoed of Latina and Latino organizations, as monicaBMH mentions. There are several orgs that are highly multicutural in nature and it would have been nice to see those orgs given more of a face in this article. Sigma Lambda Gamma, Zeta Phi Rho, Sigma Delta Sigma, and other sororities/fraternities within MGC are very multicultural and I would love to see The Daily Trojan reporting on these options for USC students (since the dues are much lower, the members are typically MUCH closer to one another than in IFC/Panhellenic sororities, and community service tends to be a bigger focus).
I’m glad to see that the Multicultural Greek Council is getting some attention on campus, however I think this article misrepresents us as a whole. The Multicultural Greek Council is not all Latina and Latino organizations. We have Armenian organizations, such as Alpha Gamma Alpha Sorority, as well as multiple organizations that identify as multicultural rather than Latina/o, including Zeta Phi Rho Fraternity, Zeta Sigma Phi Sorority, and Omega Phi Beta Sorority among others. 
In addition, Saluting is actually only one of many traditions, and is actually not practiced by most Latina/o fraternal organizations, or many of the other organizations in our council for that matter. Our council and organizations take pride in our diversity and have many traditions unique to each of our individual organizations which can include Stepping, Strolling, Surfacing, and Saluting. These practices have primarily been born out of historically NPHC traditions with multiple cultures mixed in to produce something incredibly unique to each organization. For example, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority incorporates the use of machetes in their step routines and my Sorority, Omega Phi Beta, portrays the multiple cultures of Spanish, Portuguese, Indigenous and African that melt into one to create step routines that include soft, sensual flamenco movements merged with rich, historically tribal moves. Some of the organizations in our council do not practice any of these aforementioned traditions.
I just wanted to make sure to clarify the above to avoid our council being classified in a stereotypical manner. In all, I am glad that as a council, we are able to come together in our diversity and celebrate the greater Greek System by acting as resources in the advancement of our collegiate and outside communities.

Though the Greek community is making efforts to bolster the feeling of acceptance toward homosexuality, many feel it still has a long way to go.
“I would say that it’s not fine, but that it’s getting better,” said a gay member of the Greek community who wished to remain anonymous. “Luckily it’s changing in L.A., and specifically at USC, but for a while, since the Greek system is so built on heterosexual stereotypes, it has created a certain mentality in the Greek community that makes it challenging.”
USC graduate Eric Lavis of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity said there is a “down-low culture” surrounding homosexuality in the Greek community.
“I don’t think that [it’s] generally going to be accepted. I don’t think that people want to hear about it, and I don’t think people like to talk about it.”
These heterosexual norms of the Greek community can create a clouded perception that there are no people identifying as gay in the Greek system. This perception, however, is false.
“The bad thing is that there gets to be this idea that it’s a split spectrum — gays and Greeks. But there are many gay people and allies in the Greek community,” said Steven Strozza, a member of Delta Omicron Zeta.
 
THE EXPERIENCE
 
Just like there is not just one type of Greek experience, there is not one type of LGBTQ experience within the Greek community. Some students go into recruitment knowing their sexual identity and others discover it later.
Aaron Lieberman, a senior in the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and one of two student coordinators for Greek Chat, a safe space to discuss your sexuality within the Greek community, was closeted during his recruitment process and did not come out until his sophomore year.
“I actually kind of like that it happened that way, I didn’t plan it that way,” Lieberman said. “I had gained a lot of respect from my fraternity brothers and pledges as pledge master, and so when I came out [later on] I already had their respect, love and admiration. So if your opinion is going to change and the only thing that had changed is me telling you about my sexuality, there is a red flag there.”
Lieberman had a positive and supportive experience coming out within his fraternity to the extent that he even dated another member of the fraternity. He said that he believes this was the only intrahouse openly gay couple in the Greek system at USC at the time.
“Ultimately, everybody was supportive, and it’s been a great experience,” Lieberman said. “I think once time passed, and they just realized, this is them, when they are at a party they are going to dance together and hold hands sometimes. I think that my boyfriend and I kept it appropriate for the occasion.”
Lieberman helped set the tone for this acceptance to grow within his fraternity.
“Nobody danced with other guys on the dancefloor at fraternity parties pre-me, but now that we have half a dozen members in our fraternity who are out, people don’t really pay attention to it. Whether it’s positive or negative, you get attention, and one day I hope that attention doesn’t come anymore.”
In Lieberman’s experience, the degree of acceptance from his fraternity is not reflected in the attitudes of other houses.
“It’s a problem when we go to sorority philanthropies since we are known as one of the more accepting houses,” Lieberman said. “We will get the ‘f-word’ thrown at us from other fraternities as an intimidation factor.”
Christina Vlahos shared her experience as a lesbian-identifying female in Alpha Chi Omega and the other student coordinator of Greek Chat.
“I went in completely closeted because I wanted to get that experience,” Vlahos said. “I wanted people to judge me based on me and not by my sexuality.”
Though she proudly described her experience, she admitted to being nervous during the process.
“The Greek system is so heteronormative and it’s just so traditional with the mixers and the registers, and there is this huge hook-up culture that is predominantly heterosexual,” Vlahos said. “On the outside surface, it doesn’t really seem like a gay-friendly environment just because it’s so specifically tailored to these heterosexual vibes.”
After dropping from the recruitment process and later receiving a snap bid from Alpha Chi Omega, Vlahos had a very positive experience.
“I can’t necessarily speak for the Greek system as a whole because I don’t know what it would be like in other chapters to come out, I just know specifically in my chapter it’s been awesome,” Vlahos said.
Though Vlahos feels comfortable in the sisterhood she has found, she does see the reality of the heteronormative traditions on which the entire community is founded.
“There are other gays in the Greek system, I am not this random wildflower, so it’s just, ‘How do we accommodate?’”
 
LGBTQ PERSPECTIVE
 
The heteronormative activities and traditions of Greek life are often the cause of the LGBTQ community’s perceptions, which can make it seem less desirable to gay, lesbian or bisexual students.
“I think a lot of my friends in the LGBT community who are not in Greek life have a very negative view,” Lieberman said. “It is just heteronormative. There’s no way to get around that there are a lot of traditions.”
Strozza, however, feels that certain negative run-ins can be amplified or generalized to reflect on the entire community in that way.
“I would say that because the Greek community is a little more traditional and traditional specifically in its gender roles, I think the members of QuASA, whether right or wrong, think that the Greek community is homophobic,” Strozza said. “There are also some individuals who I know who have had particular experiences; for example, girls who were in the Greek community that are lesbian and guys make the comment, ‘Oh, that’s such a waste,’ are types of homophobic comments [that] can be the ones that prevail.”
 
CHAPTER ACCEPTANCE
 
The actions of specific Greek organizations have contributed to the reputation of the community as a whole.
“I think there might be more indifference Row-wide, but I think that homophobia exists more within specific organizations,” said a student who wished to remain anonymous. “While there is a gay presence within almost all organizations of the Greek community, it just depends on the organization and whether there is more or less visible homosexuality depending if people feel comfortable coming out within those organizations.”
Though there are governing bodies for all of the Greek organizations, it is usually in the hands of the leadership of the individual chapters to set the tone.
“Honestly, the lack of people willing to be open in ‘top houses’ versus other houses just speaks to the lack of comfort there is. It makes me sad to think they would think it is bad to associate their houses with having gay members.”
Interfraternity presidents were hesitant to comment on the matter.
 
PHC AND IFC EFFORTS
 
The Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council, along with the LGBT resource center, are making efforts to open channels to acknowledge and foster acceptance of this diversity.
Greek Chat is not just for IFC or PHC members. This forum meets once a month for anyone who is either questioning his or her sexuality or is “out” and wants to discuss challenges or issues they have within the Greek system. Lieberman and Vlahos help smooth any trouble members are having combining these communities and answer questions about events such as formals, invites and recruitment.
“I feel like having [this forum] within the Greek system creates this kind of awareness,” Vlahos said. “People assume that everyone in the Greek system is straight, especially when you are rushing.”
IFC made efforts to address the topic of homosexuality last year under former Diversity Director Ehren Elder.
“[IFC’s diversity] had previously been more focused on sexual assault and ethnic diversity, but I decided to mix it up a little and focus on sexuality because I thought it was really relevant,” Elder said. “While it didn’t seem like a glaring issue, it is really the modern civil rights issue of our era and it seemed like Fraternity Row really should start trying to get ahead of the issue, if not behind it.”
During his term, Elder coordinated ally trainings for both IFC and PHC members and organized an LGBTQ rush panel.
Current IFC Diversity Director Sebastian Moya has continued Elder’s legacy on IFC by challenging the Greek community to work on increased openness and acceptance.
“We try to get groups of accepting people together to try to combat the stereotypes [that Greeks aren’t accepting],” Moya said. “It’s true, when you talk to people one on one they can say they are supportive of these issues but it’s the mob mentality that ends up prevailing.”
Moya hosted his first Greek-wide event this past Friday in honor of National Day of Silence, a day when students around the world take action in the form of silence as a way of remembering the individuals who have silenced their lives as a result of LGBTQ bullying and harassment.
“Hopefully, when I get groups of people together in the same room, a positive type of mob mentality happens and they leave saying, ‘Why shouldn’t I think that all the time?’” Moya said.
Moya has created pins that say “I am a Greek Ally” for students in the Greek community to wear on their backpacks.
“The hope is that they will see that button on the backpack and say, ‘I remember that day and I remember this cause and I remember that this is something I believe in,’” Moya said. “It’s creating things like that, little moments that people can carry with them that are positive.”
Homosexuality is also a different experience for everyone, not only between chapters but between sororities and fraternities as well.
“In my Greek Chat experience, it does weirdly seem like it is almost harder for the sororities, for the lesbians in sororities, than it is in the gay males in fraternities,” Lieberman said. “It’s funny because I always thought it would be the opposite.”
Vlahos also spoke to the fact that it was more common to hear about guys coming out within the community than girls.
“The first Greek Chat I went to, it was all guys and me,” Vlahos recalled. “I was hoping, ‘Maybe I will get to meet some other girls,’ but honestly there was just none. I didn’t hear of a single queer- identified girl until my second year into the Greek system.”
 
BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD
 
Because of the Greek community’s heteronormative social structure, often it’s the brotherhood and sisterhood aspect of the Greek community that is most appealing.
The brotherhood and sisterhood fosters opportunities to create a niche community for oneself.
“You have to make your own mini-community and the Greek system is just one way to do that and, also, what I love about the Greek system, it is an awesome place for leadership development,” Lieberman said. “So I think between the brotherhood and sisterhood aspect and leadership development, the Greek system is very influential.”
If the community were to address heterosexual norms, it could create an opportunity for greater acceptance of homosexuality as well as increased Panhellenic spirit, said Vlahos.
“Other schools, they do big philanthropies and invite sororities and fraternities,” Vlahos said. “At USC, we don’t even think to do that because there’s a competitiveness … and a lot of it is that we are doing these philanthropies because it’s a good way to meet boys.”
Though the current climate of the Greek community is seeing change toward acceptance, it has not reached the point of celebration.
“I would love that in the next few years, it’s not a topic anymore … My hope is that there is acceptance … whether it is your sexuality, your religion or your race or any disability that you are a member of the Greek community,” Lieberman said. “I want more than just acceptance of diversity but celebration of diversity.”

Here at USC, when someone makes a reference to “Greek life,” it’s often assumed to be the community of houses that make up The Row. The Greek community, however, is much larger than the 34 chapters with houses on 28th Street.
The Greek community is composed of over 60 different organizations: 12 multicultural, 4 pre-professional, 6 religious and 32 Interfraternity and Panhellenic Council fraternities and sororities.
These organizations each come with their fair share of perceptions and stereotypes. Regardless of the delineations, these organizations are brotherhoods, sisterhoods and families for many students who are challenged to find a niche within a university of roughly 18,000 undergraduates.
The letters or symbols which a member receives upon initiation to a Greek organization are not the sole identifying factor in a student’s college experience. First and foremost, this student is a Trojan and a scholar who happens to have expanded his or her horizons by joining a community. These students do not limit their involvement to their fraternities and sororities but are additionally involved in USC’s 850 other student organizations.
Though Greek organizations are frequently criticized with claims such as, “Paying dues is like buying friendship,” many students feel that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
These organizations provide networks of undergraduates and alumni, a community of brotherhood and sisterhood and opportunities for gaining leadership experience.
In this special issue of the Daily Trojan, we intend to expand the current knowledge of the USC community to understand the many different aspects and types of Greek organizations. In these pages, you can find stories ranging from the experiences of LGBTQ individuals in the Greek community to what it’s like for an athlete to go Greek.
Though this is not a complete picture of each chapter or group, we hope this creates a spark and desire to explore and learn about these unique student groups. In addition, it’s important to understand how many Greek organizations there are so that a dialogue can continue between their leadership and the leadership of other student organizations to potentially work to change existing stereotypes.
We wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the intricacies of these groups that might get overlooked in our daily coverage.
 
Fight On,
The Daily Trojan Staff

Thanks to becoming the unexpected top choice for families, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was able to repeat at No. 1 with $41.27M in a close victory over the animated sequel Rio 2, which still managed $39.33M. The South American avian comedy actually had the lead going into Saturday and Sunday but Captain 2’s Saturday boost turned it into a weekend warrior.
Oh captain! My captain! · Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves disillusioned with S.H.I.E.L.D. after the appearance of a mysterious new enemy in Captain America: The Winter Soldier,released April 4.– Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios
It had a marginally better drop than the other comparable Marvel Studios films (56.6 percent compared to Thor: The Dark World’s 57.3 percent and Iron Man 3’s 58.4 percent) and it currently stands at a great $158.88M, which is nearly as much as the first Captain America ($176.7M). Internationally it’s already eclipsed the first movie with $476.58M to date. This can only bode well for the third Captain America, which is due to challenge Batman Vs. Superman on May 6, 2016.
That being said, Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox should still be happy with Rio 2’s opening weekend. The film, which takes the characters out of Rio de Janeiro and puts them in the Amazon jungle, opened nearly on par with the first Rio, which opened to $39.2M and finished with $143.6M in 2011.
While the first film did well for itself, it wasn’t what you would consider a runaway success. Where it truly shined was internationally, finishing with $484.6M and becoming one of the most successful films ever in South America. The sequel is doing well so far and will likely play well throughout the summer due to the World Cup being in Brazil this year — localized films in host nations almost always find success.
The sequel seemed to be more of the same, introducing even more color and more avian characters.  Animated sequels are generally tricky, but families seemed to have flocked to the film in similar numbers and it’ll be the primary option for families going forward, as the next animated movie won’t be released for another two months.
In third place was Oculus, which opened with a decent $12M opening, at least compared to its $5M budget. Picked up in 2013 by Jason Blum, the producer behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious, the horror-thriller wasn’t able to break out like other horror films, although it’s not too far off from the first Insidious, which opened to $13.27M in 2011.
Though it received generally good reviews, it has also received audience backlash against the provocative ending. With competition from The Quiet Ones in two weeks, Oculus should run its course quickly.
The third wide release of the weekend, Draft Day, mustered up a mild $9.78M opening. Starring Kevin Costner as the new manager of the Cleveland Browns, the Lionsgate film had unprecedented access to NFL facilities, headquarters, even being able to film in one of the draft “war-rooms,” and effectively had an official NFL seal of approval.
While film is topical because of the imminent NFL draft and the Cleveland Browns’ current managerial mess, it didn’t seem to have the same level of drama or prestige as films such as Moneyball, which was based on a true story, unlike Draft Day. Original stories are generally difficult to make exciting in sports movies and, although the inside look at the process behind drafting is intriguing, it’s just not the same as the real thing.
This also sadly marks the second disappointment for Kevin Costner this year, after 3 Days to Kill’s week opening weekend of $12.24M. Sports films are one of Kevin Costner’s go-to genres, having starred in Field of Dreams, Bull Durham and Tin Cup but this one just wasn’t able to score the touchdown.
