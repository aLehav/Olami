Five USC students will head to Austin, Texas during spring break to learn about the death penalty and how to start their own anti-death penalty groups on campus.

The anti-death penalty alternative spring break was started by the Texas Moratorium Network in 2004 and was first held in 2005. Now entering its seventh spring session, the program is also sponsored by national organizations like Students Against the Death Penalty, Witness to Innocence and Amnesty International.
Approximately 30 students from around the country will attend the program, according to event organizers.
The event aims to not only increase political awareness specifically related to the death penalty, but also to encourage students to be politically active.
Students will hear from six exonerated people who spent a combined 50 years on death row for crimes they did not commit. The students will work together to organize a “Day of Innocence” rally to oppose the death penalty.
Quyen Nguyen Le, a freshman majoring in public policy and management, said she went on an alternative winter break trip to Nicaragua to research women’s rights and economics with USC’s Creating Just Communities, and enjoyed it so much that she decided to find an alternative spring break trip. Her goal was to find a trip focused on how to start and organize political movements.
“This workshop is very different from just learning about the issue,” Le said. “It’s more geared toward actual political organizing, and I know I’ll definitely do some kind of political organizing on campus in the future.”
Students will attend a showing of Incendiary, a documentary about the case of Todd Willingham who was executed in 2004 despite controversy surrounding the investigation, which will be shown at the 2011 SXSW Film Conference and Festival.
Le said she doesn’t know much about the death penalty and wants to learn more about how it could affect California’s prison spending.
“I felt compelled to go on several levels,” she said. “This offers the opportunity to learn about something and to take real action about it.”
Jennie Lee, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said she signed up after going on the same Nicaragua trip because she wanted her spring break trip to be meaningful.
“Other than wanting to know more about grassroots organizing and activism, I really wanted to do something more useful with my time during spring break,” Lee said.
USC hosted the “Lethal Injustice: Standing against the Death Penalty and Harsh Punishment” panel Wednesday, featuring Mark Clements, administrator for the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, and Paul Wright, editor and co-founder of Prison Legal News. The event was organized by the International Socialist campus organization and featured Mark Clements, who was tortured and forced to say things in court to guarantee his conviction, Cameron Sturdevant, a leader in the social movement against the death penalty and Paul Wright, the editor of Prison Legal News.
The panel discussed the effectiveness of the prison system, the issue of overcrowding in prisons and the fact that the United States is one of the only two remaining capitalist countries to use the death penalty.

College students might want to think twice before lighting a cigarette: a new study shows that smoking during adolescence can affect cognition and decision-making.
UCLA researchers found that the pre-frontal cortex, which controls higher cognition, including the ability to make good decisions and think about future consequences, was less active in adolescents with greater addictions to nicotine, suggesting that smoking affects brain development and function.
Exhale · Smoking might inhibit brain development causing impaired ability to make rational judgments, including the choice to quit smoking. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
“As the prefrontal cortex continues to develop during the critical period of adolescence, smoking may influence the trajectory of brain development and affect the function of the prefrontal cortex,” Edythe London, the study’s senior author said, in a press release.
According to the 2007 National College Health Assessment for USC 3.3 percent of USC undergraduates and 2.6 percent of USC graduates smoke on a daily basis.
Furthermore, 13.9 percent of undergraduates and 10.2 percent of graduates reported they smoked, but not every day.
According to London, if the pre-frontal cortex’s development is affected, adolescents might have an impeded ability to make rational judgments, including the choice to stop smoking.
A smoker who does worry about the effects of smoking is Sung Won Lee, a PhD student studying electrical engineering.
“Smoking affects my focus and doesn’t make me concentrate,” Lee said. “My major concern is my health and finally, I’m going to quit.”
Students who smoke daily could experience serious effects in prefrontal cortex development and activation because of smoking.
Researchers do not know exactly what in cigarettes causes less activity in the pre-frontal cortex.
“It seems to be nicotine. But there are so many other toxins in cigarettes that we can’t be sure yet,” said Adriana Galvan, first author of the study.
How much smoking will impair adolescents’ abilities to make decisions is unclear as of now and cannot be addressed without further research.
“We will need to follow teenagers who smoke for several years and then bring them in for tests to see,” Galvan said. “We are developing this process now.”
That’s why I have a medical marijuana card.
Cigarettes are bad for you???!!! Oh no!
A lot of things impair judgment. I smoke cigarettes because I like them; I don’t really care about having less activity in my pre-frontal cortex. There are more important things for me to worry about.
ha! case in point ^

Craigslist is a convenient way for students to sell their belongings, but sellers can never be certain they will be paid, a reality that has hit some Craigslist users at USC hard in the last few months.
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said there have only been two known instances of USC students being deceived over Craigslist recently.
“You have to be really careful who you meet and where you’re going to meet them,” Carlisle said.
One student was robbed two months ago by a couple who posed as buyers on Craigslist, according to Carlisle. The student advertised his Playstation on Craigslist and agreed to meet a prospective buyer on Figueroa Street.
Upon meeting the buyer, the student was directed to a nearby restaurant’s parking lot, where a car was waiting. The man inside the car asked to see the device, and once he had possession of the device, he and his girlfriend drove away, dragging along the student who was trying to regain his property.
“It was obvious after that they had planned this to rip off the student,” Carlisle said. “Luckily the student wasn’t more seriously injured.”
Another incident occurred about two weeks ago on 28th Street when a student had advertised an electronic device on Craigslist and agreed to meet the prospective buyer out on the street, according to Carlisle.
Two suspects were waiting in a car on the street and when the student passed the device into the car, the car sped away. Again, the student was left hanging half-inside, half-outside the car while trying to recover the property.
“Both suffered some minor scrapes, cuts and bruises,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle said both incidents are being investigated by the LAPD.
Carlisle advises students to take basic precautions before meeting with potential buyers.
“If you’re going to agree to meet someone to show the property you’re going to sell … Then take a person along with you and meet in some highly public place where lots of other people are around so you’re less likely to be victimized,” Carlisle said.
Some students have also had problems with false advertisers on Craigslist.
Gaia von Meister, a junior majoring in English, said she once found a great deal on a beach cruiser on Craigslist that seemed almost too good to be true.
Von Meister said she was in contact with the seller and the two agreed to meet in Downtown. She said she had some nervous feelings about meeting the seller, so she asked her boyfriend to go with her.
“I had texted the guy an hour and a half before and we agreed that the meeting was still on,” von Meister said. “When we got there, we waited 20 minutes, I called the guy five times and he never answered.”
Von Meister said she thinks the prospective seller, might have seen her waiting outside of the apartment building accompanied by another man, not alone.
“Maybe they saw me pressing my phone and trying to call someone,” von Meister said. “If my boyfriend hadn’t have been there, I’m afraid something would have happened.”
Carlisle emphasized the importance of listening to your intuition.
“If in your gut something doesn’t seem right, stop, think a second time, and don’t do it. Quite often our intuition is correct,” Carlisle said. “It’s not worth getting hurt over a small electrical device that can be replaced, but a life or injury is not easy to deal with, so take reasonable precautions.”
Von Meister said she knew something wasn’t right from the start and should have listened to her instincts.
“It looked too good to be true,” von Meister said. “I shouldn’t have gone, but I was telling myself, ‘Why are you freaked out?’”

When Dana and David Dornsife returned to their hotel room after President C. L. Max Nikias’ inaugural speech in October, they both had one thing on their mind: naming the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
Benefactors · David Dornsife graduated from USC in 1965. He and his wife, Dana Dornsife, both sit on the board of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute. They donated $200 million in unrestricted funds to the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. - Courtesy of Philip Channing 
“We were staying at the Radisson across the street, and we both kind of simultaneously brought out, ‘Wouldn’t that be exciting if they announced in the future ‘the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences,’ but instead they said ‘the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences?’” David Dornsife said. “That was the first time we saw each other [that day] and we both had the same idea.”
Further talks with Howard Gillman, dean of the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences, as well as meetings with Nikias led to the Dornsife’s $200 million unrestricted donation to the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, which will officially be renamed the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences on March 23.
“We’re thrilled to be able to do it,” Dana Dornsife said. “And we feel very blessed and fortunate to have the financial resources that allow us to do things like this to help make the world a better place.”
The Dornsifes’ pledge is the largest single donation in USC’s history. They credit Nikias with motivating them to give during his inauguration speech.
“He put a challenge out to the audience to have the courage to explore boldly and he really put forward a very aggressive agenda on the things that he wanted to do to improve the quality of the education at USC and to attract highly sought after professors,” Dana Dornsife said. “Dave and I really took that to heart.”
The donation will also create a Dornsife Scholars Program, given to graduating seniors in the College who plan to continue with the research they began at USC on a national or global scale.
“The idea of the Dornsife scholars is to take top performers and incentivize them to go on further, and in particular, look at those that feel that they can change the world as a result of the scholarly work that they could continue to do at USC,” David Dornsife said.
At a Visions & Voices event about two years ago, the Dornsifes were invited to talk about water-well drilling in Africa and their involvement there. They left impressed by the students’ reaction, which gave them faith in the students to make a difference in the world.
“We were overwhelmed with the students who were very eager to do what they could do to change the world and were asking us if we had any ideas for them,” Dana Dornsife said. “That mindset, coming from the heart, and being passionate about helping their fellow man, David and I are very impressed with them.”
Because the $200 million is an unrestricted endowment, the College can use the money in any way it sees fit.
The Dornsifes are not worried about the different ways the money will be used.
“We have a lot of faith in the individuals running the College,” David Dornsife said. “We’re not concerned about mistakes being made because they’re good people and they know a lot about education.”
David Dornsife graduated from USC’s business school in 1965 and is currently a USC trustee and chairman of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute in the neurosciences. His parents were also USC alumni. Dana Dornsife also sits on the board of the Brain and Creativity Institute.
Their involvement in the neuroscience program provided opportunities for the Dornsifes to meet faculty in the College, as well as the dean.
“We think the fact that the neuroscience program is funded and working is an example of what could be done when you really focus on an area,” David Dornsife said. “All that exposure with the neurosciences started getting us interested in broadening out to the rest of the members of the college, so that was the catalyst that got us a chance to be involved intimately with other disciplines.”
Dana Dornsife said they are proud of the interdisciplinary studies taking place at USC, and donated specifically to the College because they feel it has more interdisciplinary opportunities for students.
The Dornsifes plan to continue their support of both neuroscience and the College through meetings with Gillman and continuing their positions in the Brain and Creativity Institute.
“We think this is the right time to be supportive of the school,” David Dornsife said. “We think they’re doing a great job and we hope this helps lift them to a higher level.”
WOW. Great news for USC. fight on.

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet will visit USC on May 3 for two events hosted by the USC Student Interfaith Council.
“We are very excited that the Dalai Lama has accepted the USC Student Interfaith Council’s invitation to speak on campus,” said Varun Soni, Dean of Religious Life at USC. “We see this as an extraordinary and unique opportunity and are very excited for this to take place.”
The first event will take place in the morning at the Galen Center, where the Dalai Lama will give a public talk on secular ethics, religious pluralism and the relationship between spirituality and science. A question-and-answer session moderated by Dr. James Doty, board member of the Dalai Lama Foundation, will follow the lecture.
The Dalai Lama will participate in a panel of scholars, also including USC neuroscience professor Antonio Damasio and USC professor of philosophy and law Gideon Yaffe, in an event that afternoon at Bovard Auditorium. The panel will talk about consciousness, cognition and contemplation.
Sarrah Shahawy, student leader of the Student Interfaith Council, said she believes the Dalai Lama’s choice to speak at USC is a testament to the Student Interfaith Council’s high level of involvement for advocating religious discussion.
“USC is a leader in interfaith work as a university, and we are a very active organization, especially compared to ones at other schools across the country,” Shahawy said. “We strive to work towards fostering an interfaith community, and are very committed to working across ethnic divides.”
Shahawy also said she expects student turnout at both events to be extremely high because of the Dalai Lama’s strong influence on religion in the 21st century.
“This really is a once in a lifetime opportunity, especially since the Dalai Lama is starting to cut down on his worldwide tours,” she said. “It truly is a huge honor that one of the foremost religious leaders of our time, who has devoted his life to making the world a better place for all, is coming to our campus.”
Tickets to both events will go on sale online Sat., March 12, and over the phone Mon., March 14.
Students can buy tickets at a discounted price of $20 each for up to four tickets to each event. USC faculty and staff are eligible to buy up to two tickets for a discounted rate of $50 each for the event taking place at Bovard.
Proceeds from both events will be donated to the Dalai Lama Foundation. Students should also expect to receive an e-mail from the USC Ticket Office with additional information about pricing and availability.
More information about both events will be available at dalailama.usc.edu. The website is expected to be open to traffic tomorrow.
From my understanding, the Dalai Lama is coming to speack about Buddhist teaching and the relationship between these teachings and science. The fusion between Buddhism and science has been discussed and promoted by various Buddhist master. It is a very interesting perspective to use science to explain Buddhist teachings. It will be a great learning experience.
I suspect those that are critical of his visit have heard PRC propganda their entire lives.  You attend a private University, which is a great opportunity to GROW and LEARN and utilize CRITICAL THINKING.  Why at such a young age be so firm and harsh?  Are you not comfortable in your perspective  on life?  What can the Dalai Lama take form you? Nothing.  He is a peace activist and teacher…
AWESOME!!!!  I suggest listen………. rather than prosecute.  
You may take the position of politics or spirituality.  The choice is yours.
What has USC sunk to?
DaiLai, get out of the earth~~
Are you kidding me ? I can not believe USC invite a person who seems to be a religious leader but actually a politician

The USC men’s tennis team hopes to keep its momentum swinging in the right direction as it battles No. 3 Texas on Friday and No. 27 Louisville on Saturday.
USC will also travel to Florida next week to take on No. 15 Florida and No. 36 Florida State.
The Trojans and Longhorns last met more than a year ago, when the then-No. 1 Trojans fell to then-No. 8 Texas in the quarterfinals of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships last year.
Doubles play was the thorn in the Trojans’ side and they were ultimately not able to bring it back in singles play, losing 4-2.
“[They have] very good doubles teams, so it will be a really good win,” said senior Jaak Poldma. “It will be tough though. I think our singles will be stronger on the top courts.”
Doubles has been a sore spot all season for the Trojans, who would like to avoid repeat of last year.
Lately, however, the Trojans have begun to look stronger and more consistent, especially during last week’s 5-2 win against UCLA.
“[It has] a lot to do with injury,” Poldma said. “We tried a few different lineups when some of the guys were out and found what works.”
Injuries have still been an issue for the Trojans, with senior Peter Lucassen sidelined with a stress fracture.
Earlier this season freshmen Michael Grant and Ray Sarmiento were out, and sophomore J.T. Sundling recently hurt his knee.
“We’re a good team as a whole, so whenever we’re all playing it’s good,” Poldma said. “But when we’re injured it’s not so good. Still, I think that when we are healthy we’re the favorites.”
Singles has been a strong spot for USC, with dominant performances from the top four seeds, juniors Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen, Poldma and Sarmiento. Johnson competed as a wildcard entry in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells earlier this week.
“Steve has been unbelievable,” Poldma said. “He just lost to a top player. I haven’t lost a set. Daniel is ranked in the top 20, and Raymond hasn’t lost a match since he had to forfeit [due to injury].”
First serve against Texas is at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium. The Trojans then take on Louisville on Saturday.
The teams met earlier this season in Seattle at this year’s ITA Indoor Championships where USC beat the Cardinal in a 4-0 shutout.
Saturday’s matchup begins at noon.

Sometimes, I just watch in amazement.
The so-called basketball IQ, the court instincts and awareness — you just can’t teach basketball players that kind of stuff.
Combine that with vision, ball-handling ability and a shooting stroke that is textbook perfect, and you have a package that makes the complete basketball player.
I’m not talking about Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant or LeBron James.
There’s a player sitting in our very own backyard who fits that description perfectly.
Her name is Jacki Gemelos.
If anybody on the planet was born to play basketball, I’d have to bet my money on Gemelos.
She committed to play at the University of Connecticut at the age of 15.
But in 2006 of her senior year, she de-committed from UConn and instead settled on USC.
By the end of her high school career, she was named a McDonald’s All-American, WBCA All-American and Miss Basketball of California.
She was named 2006 National Player of the Year by MaxPreps and Scout.com and runner-up for Player of the Year by Parade and Hoopgurlz.com.
Heralded as the No. 1 recruit in the nation, she nearly averaged 40 points her senior year.
The only thing between her and WNBA stardom was collegiate basketball.
Gemelos was a can’t-miss prospect, a once-in-a-decade talent.
She seemed destined for greatness, for Hall-of-Fame status even, but then, arguably the worst injury a basketball player could suffer hit Gemelos.
A torn right ACL ended her decorated high-school career.
The injury forced Gemelos out of action and subsequently, she missed her 2006-07 freshman season at USC.
A long, grueling recovery period, followed by rehab, and then everything would be fine.
But then it happened again.
Another tear in the same ACL in 2007-08 brought another year of recovery and rehab.
Then, it happened yet again in 2008-09 — this time, it was her left ACL.
Three injuries in three years before she even stepped on the hardwood at USC.
Even then, more bad news.
Because a graft had deteriorated in her left knee, a fourth operation was required.
By now, most people would have called it quits. You could say it’s bad luck or just not meant to be, but for Gemelos, it was different.
“I guess I just think that not everybody gets to feel so passionate about something in life,” Gemelos said. “I’m fortunate for that.”
Finally, she is getting her shot.
She made her long-awaited USC debut last season, on Feb. 4, 2010.
I was there the first time she played competitive basketball three and a half years ago.
And Gemelos still had it. The basketball IQ, the vision, the ball handling and the shooting stroke never disappeared.
Sure, she might have lost a step or two, but the talent was certainly still there. Eight points, five rebounds and five assists in her first game donning that cardinal and gold jersey.
But even if the statistics don’t measure what she’s done, it’s the little plays that make you turn your head and say, “Wow.”
It’s those plays that show you why she was the No. 1 player in the nation. But even a greater triumph than what she achieves on the court is how she made it back from off the court.
Through hard work, determination and her unfailing love for the game of basketball, Gemelos just wanted to play again.
“It’s something I want to pursue as long as it takes, no matter what it takes, because I only get one shot at this and I want to see what I can do,” she said.
Now, in her first full season, Gemelos has made her mark on the USC women’s basketball team.
She is third on the team in scoring and recorded a career-high 27 points earlier this year against Fresno State.
She was recently nominated as an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention and is a finalist for the 11th annual V Foundation Comeback Award by the V Foundation for Cancer Research.
The stats in the box score don’t mean much anymore — the mere fact she is healthy and playing speaks louder than words.
Despite those dark days and those trying times, Gemelos never quit.
She was determined to make it, to prove she still had that talent, to chase that long-awaited dream of playing in the WNBA.
Because of that, she epitomizes what it really means to be a Woman of Troy.
We don’t have to tell Jacki Gemelos to “Fight on.”
She’s a living example.

For the Trojans, the week leading up to the Big Dance is defined by one particular emotion: uncertainty.
Heading into today’s quarterfinal contest at noon against the California Golden Bears, the Trojans’ future is unquestionably hazy. A season full of impressive wins (Tennessee, Texas, Arizona, UCLA, Washington) and head-scratching losses (Bradley, Ryder, TCU, Oregon) leaves USC (18-13- 10-8) with work still to be done before the NCAA’s Selection Committee determines whether USC will be included in the field of 68.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill believes in his team, although he told the team this week that to play postseason basketball, simplifying the challenges ahead will be key.
“If we are good enough to be in the field of 68, we will be there,“ O’Neill said. “We need to take one game at a time, try and win the tournament and leave the rest up to the committee who does this job year round.”
Heading into today’s matchup with Cal (17-13, 10-8), USC leads the Pac-10 in scoring defense, allowing teams to score just under 63 points per game.
Although the team is led by senior guard Marcus Simmons, who was named the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year this week, in two regular season games against the Bears, the Trojans have struggled at the defensive end. California is the only team in the conference to score more than 65 points twice against USC all year — a trend O’Neill admits must end today if the Trojans want to fulfill bigger aspirations.
“[California] is really explosive offensively,” O’Neill said. “Their big guys give our big guys trouble because they are a little bit quicker and as a team they score from every spot.”
The two teams have split the season series, with both teams winning on the others’ home court. USC won most recently 78-75 on Feb. 17 at Haas Pavilion, in a game in which freshman guard Maurice Jones scored 22 second-half points off the bench.
California drew first blood Jan. 22 at the Galen Center, as junior forward Harper Kamp’s 18 points and stingy defense on USC’s junior forward Nikola Vucevic (a season-low six points) gave the Bears a 68-66 victory.
Several players recognize the team has a lot to prove today and into the rest of the weekend.
“I don’t know if we really have done enough yet, so it’s important we just got out there and try to win every game,” Simmons said. “If we lose this game, we probably won’t be in anything, not even the NIT. So we want to go out there and play strong and hopefully get to the NCAAs”
Despite being named as one of ESPN Bracketologist Joe Lounardi’s “Last Four Teams Out,” recent conference tournament history might be on the side of the No. 4 seeded Trojans.
In 2009, the last time USC was eligible to compete in the Pac-10 tournament, the No. 6 seeded Trojans won the conference postseason championship with wins over three of the top four seeds.
Most of this year’s leading contributors, including Vucevic (17.7 points and 10.3 rebounds per game) and senior forward Alex Stephenson (9.9 points and 9 rebounds per game) were not key players for the 2009 team.
USC, however, is the only team in the conference this year to beat each of the tournament’s top three seeds: Arizona, UCLA and Washington.
If the Trojans advance to the semifinals with a win over California, they will play the winner of Arizona/(Stanford or Oregon State) on Friday night at 6 p.m.

With all-conference junior guard Ashley Corral suspended, the USC women’s basketball team looked to its bench for a spark during an opening-round victory in the Pac-10 women’s basketball tournament.
Breakout performance · Freshman forward Cassie Harberts, pictured here against Oregon, led the way for the Women of Troy on Wednesday with a career-high 31 points. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
A career night by freshman forward Cassie Harberts didn’t hurt, either. Harberts scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Women of Troy (19-11, 10-8) to a 78-66 victory over Washington State.
After the game, Harberts credited her performance to the work the team put in during the last two weeks pounding the ball inside. Senior center Kari LaPlante had a simpler explanation.
“No one could stop her, so we just kept going [to her],” LaPlante said.
Harberts’ outstanding performance notwithstanding, it was little-used freshman guard Desireé Bradley who helped spur USC on to victory. After a sluggish start that saw the Women of Troy miss 10 of their first 14 shots, Bradley knocked down two consecutive three-pointers to push USC to a 16-11 advantage.
From there, the starters — particularly Harberts — took over. USC scored on six straight possessions midway through the first half to break open the game. By the time the run was over, the Women of Troy held a seemingly comfortable 14-point lead with five minutes left in the first half.
But the Cougars (8-23, 6-12) went on a run of their own, closing the half on a 10-2 spurt. At the halftime buzzer, Washington State guard April Cook banked in a desperation heave from just inside half court to narrow the gap to 35-29 at the break.
“Sometimes we get a little flat but we always seem to pick it up and fight through it,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos.
At halftime, Harberts led USC with 13 points and six rebounds. As a team, the Women of Troy shot 41 percent from the field compared to 37 percent shooting for the Cougars.
Both teams came out hot in the second half, with the Women of Troy scoring on their first three possessions. USC pushed its lead back to double digits at 50-39 on a putback by Harberts, and kept a similar margin for the remainder of the game.
“I commend these girls for playing extremely hard in the second half,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “Now it’s all about the will to win.”
USC matched every three-pointer Washington State made — and there were plenty — by pounding it inside to Harberts. The Cougars kept the game close by connecting on 11 three-pointers.
In a bizarre sequence late in the game, the Women of Troy picked up four points — all on free throws — on one possession.
After Harberts knocked down two free throws, a Washington State player threw LaPlante to the ground. The 6-foot-5 senior knocked down both free throws to extend the USC lead to 67-51.
Gemelos added 13 points and nine rebounds for the Women of Troy. LaPlante added 10 points and eight rebounds. Harberts recorded her career-high by shooting 10-of-16 from the floor and 10-of-12 from the line.
“Give credit to USC,” said Washington State coach June Daugherty. “They took advantage of some great frontcourt play tonight.”
With the win, the Women of Troy move on to face Arizona today at 5:15 p.m. in the quarterfinals.
“We’re right there,” Cooper said.  “This is the same record we had last year but we have the opportunity to improve on that [against Arizona].”
The same problem the team has had all year relaxing too much when they build a double digit lead. The fantastic career night for Harberts, and only a 12 pt. victory at home over a team that was 8 – 22 overall. These kind of squads need to be blown out when playing on your home court to make a statement.

While most students will head off to exotic locales for their spring break, the USC men’s golf team is heading to Las Vegas. Unlike their peers, however, they aren’t heading there for a week of lounging and partying. The Trojans will kick off their break at the Southern Highlands Collegiate golf tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Southern Highlands golf club.
The team is coming off of a fairly strong opening this season, with a fifth place finish at the Mauna Lani Invitational in Honolulu, HI, and an 8th place finish at the USC Collegiate Invitational in Westlake, Calif.
USC will face many opponents they have seen already this year, as well as a couple new ones. The field includes, Arizona, Arizona State, Baylor, Cal, Duke, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Oklahoma State, Texas Christian University, Texas, Texas A &M, Texas Tech, UCLA, and UNLV. Despite the deep field, USC remains unphased:
“We don’t really worry about the other teams,” said freshman Jeffery Kang. “We’ve just gotta stick together and play well.”
Golfing this weekend for the Trojans are Kang, junior Steve Lim, freshman Ramsey Sahyoun, sophomore Stewart Hagestad and sophomore Sam Smith.
Lim has had a solid season so far, finishing 22nd in Honolulu with a strong 4-under-par 212 (70, 73, 69) and 27th in Westlake with a 5-over-par 218 (69, 81, 68).
Kang has also played well this season, finishing 59th at the competitive invitational in Honolulu with a 2-over-par 218 (68, 81, 71). He stepped up his performance in Westlake, tying for 29th place with a 6-over-par 219 (70, 79, 70).
Sahyoun has also appeared twice this season, hitting a 2-over-par 218 (68, 81, 71) in Honolulu for 51st place, and tying Kang in Westlake with a 6-over-par 219 (71, 77, 71)
Hagestad and Smith both played as individuals at the invitational in Westlake, where Hagestad made the strongest Trojan appearance, finishing 14th at 2-over-par 215 (72, 72, 71). Smith tied for 29th with a 6-over-par 219 (72, 76, 71).
The Trojans belive that they have a good shot this weekend, due to their preparation and skill.
“I think we’re at the point where things are really starting to come together. The goal every week is to get out there and play well, and hopefully that leads to a win,” Kang said.
The Trojans hope to find success this weekend as they prepare for the upcoming championships.

When you walk in to the USC baseball clubhouse after any given win, there are a few things you can expect to hear.
First is a rousing rendition of the So-Cal Spell-Out, led by USC interim coach Frank Cruz after he speaks to the team.
Second is the sound of Afro-Man’s “Colt 45” blaring over the speakers as the players shower.
Finally, there is the unbridled joy of victory. Players shouting for no apparent reason, good-natured jibs, laughter and of course, Afro-Man sing-alongs.
But those sounds haven’t been heard for more than two weeks, a span in which the Trojans have lost eight straight games.
“It’s rough,” Cruz said. “We’re not getting the big hits we need. But we gotta stick with each other and we know the hits will start coming.”
Yes, just a few hits here or there for the Trojans and their season thus far would be dramatically different.  Five of their losses have been by just one run, and only one was by more than three.
USC hasn’t been getting beaten by mediocre competition either. Six of the Trojans losses came against either No. 18 Rice, or No. 6 Cal State Fullerton. Only UC Santa Barbara—the Trojans most recent loss—is arguably a more inferior opponent.
“You could see it wearing on the guys [in the UCSB game]” Cruz said. “They were sort of acting like ‘is this really gonna happen again?’ We just gotta get them to play baseball the way they know they can. Once the monkey’s off our back you’re gonna see a whole different team.”
USC will have three chances against three different teams to snap its losing streak. It takes on St. Mary’s on Friday and Georgia on Saturday at Dedeaux Field. Both the Gaels and Bulldogs have losing records. A win in one of those games is important, because on Sunday, the Trojans will face No. 13 UCLA at Dodger Stadium.
“It’ll be special,” Cruz said. “Any time you get a chance to play in a big league park it means a lot.”
Senior Logan Odom will get the start for USC on Sunday. He took a hard luck loss last Sunday against Fullerton after allowing just two runs (one unearned) on three hits over seven and two-third innings. This season, he’s been the Trojans best starter by E.R.A.
“Odom has been throwing the ball really well,” Cruz said. “All our pitchers have.”
Indeed it has been the hitting that has plagued the Trojans on their current losing streak. They scored just five runs in three games last weekend against Fullerton and have averaged less than three runs a game on their current streak.
The problem isn’t getting runners on, it’s getting them in. In their five one-run games the Trojans have put the tying run on base in the eighth or ninth inning every time, but simply haven’t gotten him in.
“If you put yourself in those situations like we have, you gonna win one eventually,” Cruz said. “A ball is gonna find a hole. Baseball can change quickly, and we know it.”
The Trojans could use quite a bit of change this weekend.

After garnering their first Pac-10 win last week, the USC women’s tennis team will battle against the No. 58 Fresno State today before it heads to Malibu, Calif. on Saturday for a match against Pepperdine.
Despite a rough start to singles against Washington, the Women of Troy (8-2, 1-0) showed their usual top form in closing out the Huskies 6-1 on the heels of senior Maria Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian.
In doubles, specifically, the Sanchez-Christian combo has risen to No. 20 in the nation after starting out No. 80 at the outset of the season.
The development of Christian has helped supplement USC’s talent at the top, along with Sanchez and junior Danielle Lao. Since taking over the third slot in singles, Christian has shown great poise against better competition with her only loss coming at the hands of UCLA’s top player, Andrea Remnyse.
Although Fresno State has been a powerhouse in recent years, they only enter the week at 3-5 on the year. Before they face USC, the Bulldogs will have to travel to Westwood, which could prove to do them in when they play the Women of Troy.
“In the past they have been a top-20 team and for about eight years running they were nasty,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “Not to say this year they shouldn’t be taken lightly, but we are looking for a good win on Thursday.”
Fresno State does boast No. 77 Lucia Battle in the top singles spot, as she looks to take down the nation’s No. 2 player in Maria Sanchez.
Pepperdine will prove to be more of a challenge against USC, coming in at 6-2 on the season. While the Waves don’t jump out at you statistically, they’ve been able to grit out tough victories against Texas and San Diego (both USC victims) led by senior Anamika Bhargava.
“The match, especially being at Pepperdine, is a prickly one,” Gallien said. “We’re really going to have to watch out [on Saturday].”

Months ago, British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver brought a proposal to the Los Angeles Unified School District. He wanted to shoot the second season of Food Revolution, a show focused on reforming school lunches to be healthier, in Los Angeles schools.
LAUSD said no.
The show is an evolution of Oliver’s British programs such as Jamie’s School Dinners and Jamie’s Ministry of Food, which dealt with repairing unhealthy eating habits at home and at school. Eventually, Oliver decided to create Food Revolution, and traveled to Huntington, West Virginia, an area named “America’s Unhealthiest” by an Associated Press poll.
Oliver worked with the district’s cafeterias to produce fresher, healthier food for students. The kids of the Cabell County Schools, a 12,700-student district in Huntington, didn’t take kindly to Oliver’s new changes at first, but have since grown to enjoy Oliver’s recipes, according to The Huffington Post.
From there, Los Angeles seemed like a logical choice. After all, the city of angels boasts of the nation’s second-largest school district and serves up 1.2 million meals a day.
But LAUSD stopped the Food Revolution crew in its tracks, saying  a TV show would be too disruptive.
“We’re interested in Jamie Oliver the food activist, not Jamie the reality TV star,” Robert Alaniz, district spokesman told the Post. “We’ve invited him to work with our menu committee, but there’s too much drama, too much conflict with a reality show.”
The first season of the show was rife with drama and conflict over the poor, under-nutritious food being served to kids in the district and what officials weren’t doing about it.
On second thought, maybe showing the conflict was the whole point. Yes, Oliver’s criticisms had left a bit of a sore spot with Cabell County Schools in West Virginia, and LAUSD would likely have suffered the same bruises to their reputation. But wouldn’t it have been worth it to improve kids’ diets and bring national attention to the issue of quality of school meals?
That question still hangs in the air as LAUSD seemingly continues to keep the cameras, and the public eye, out of its business.
Luckily for Oliver, he was able to film two weeks’ worth of footage at West Adams Preparatory School, which is run by the organization MLA Partner Schools under contract with LAUSD. After two weeks, however, LAUSD found out and, as promised, kicked out Oliver.
Mike McGalliard, the president of MLA Partner schools, wasn’t thrilled about Oliver being kicked out.
“We aren’t happy about it,” McGalliard said. “I told the district, ‘you guys are making a big fuss over nothing. It’s not an expose. It’s an incredible program.’”
According to McGalliard, nearly half of the students at West Adams are obese. This is even more upsetting considering the examples he gave of some of the school’s regular lunches: chicken nuggets and corn dogs, with raw broccoli as a vegetable side.
Raw broccoli? What average schoolkid is going to eat raw broccoli? It’s hard to fathom this is being presented as a healthy meal at one of central L.A.’s better schools.
Although LAUSD has done what it can to promote better eating habits at schools, like banning sodas and junk food, a show like Food Revolution would have done more by offering compromises and solutions to the fundamental problem of creating quality school meals on a budget.
More importantly, the show might have inspired schools, students and parents to start caring more. LAUSD very curiously missed an opportunity to take advantage of a national stage.
No one likes being publicly told they’re doing things wrong and they need to change.
This same issue came up in the first season of the show, of course. Old habits die hard, and the Cabell County School district had issues with Oliver’s techniques, especially when they involved fudging the abysmally-low meal budget. What did this price change entail? For the paying students, it amounted to an increase of 13 cents on average.
LAUSD thinks it has everything under control and there doesn’t need to be embarrassment on TV positive change to effect. But considering the national scale of this problem, the district should have had the cojones to say it could use a fresh, radical perspective.
Doing so on TV would’ve encouraged other districts to face facts about their meals as well. Instead, they kicked, and kept, Oliver out.
Sophia Ruvalcaba, a 17-year-old diabetic student at West Adams Preparatory, said it best:
“He was just trying to make a healthier meal for us.”
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Food As Life,” runs Thursdays. 
The story you linked to was on the Huffington Post website but it was by the Associated Press. I believe all of the quotes and most of the facts here come from that story, so AP should get the credit.
Robert’s right.  Reality TV is about ratings more than anything else.  Why would the LAUSD want to exploit its students and staff so that “the Naked Chef” can get more advertising dollars?
Correction:
This reporter obviously didn’t do his homework on LAUSD because if he had he would have discovered that LAUSD is already leading the nation in serving healthy and nutritious meals to its students. It has already taken extraordinary steps in banning the sale of sodas and other drinks high in sugar in its schools, banning the sale of junk food, eliminating added trans fats and palm oil, reducing sodium levels and added sugars and increasing access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Additionally the district has been recognized and commended by the federal government as having food nutrition guidelines that far exceed the government’s own guidelines. What’s more legitimate news media are always welcome into LAUSD’s food service areas and many have already covered the district’s food services. Plain and simple district is not interested in reality TV. Too much drama and conflict! Perhaps the reporter is better suited to covering entertainment stories rather than serious stories dealing with food policy.

When films explore a force of nature, they tend to be hit or miss. M. Night Shyamalan’s The Happening attempted to depict powerless people pitted against forces beyond their control, but wound up an unintentionally funny disaster. Many times, the force itself becomes a metaphor for some cultural zeitgeist and the focus is lost.
Christopher Smith’s Black Death never loses its focus. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not so strong.

Set in 1348 in the middle of the Black Plague outbreak, the film follows Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), a novice monk who is drafted into guiding a group of warriors led by Ulric (Sean Bean).There are rumors of a village untouched by the plague, and Ulric has been told it’s led by a necromancer.
The mission is simple: find the village and kill the leader.
There are elements of horror, some minor action moments and a smattering of character story tropes to be found. On both topical and thematic levels, Black Death takes several cues from Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, but the film never decided what direction to go in.
One thing the film does nail is its tone. A sense of creeping unease permeates every scene and death is a constant presence in the film. The plague’s effects are shown early and often.
Dead bodies litter the screen, and graveyards, masked doctors and burned corpses are a reoccurring sight.
This lends itself to the picture’s unique aesthetic. Put simply, Black Death is a very desaturated film. The colors are washed out and there’s a grittiness to the film stock that gives the film a rough feel. It’s also quite dirty, since the characters are soiled with dust and grime.
When the warriors and Osmund finally arrive at the village, the desaturation remains, but the grime is gone.
It’s an understated, but extremely effective touch. When they find the village’s leader, Langiva (Carice van Houten), she is a clean, colorful figure who stands entirely at odds with the world the travelers know.
The film’s main problem, however, lies in its pacing. Black Death creates an unsettling atmosphere perfectly, but it never follows through and lacks true payoff. There is no escalation or sense of growing dread.
Things simply happen, often at odd moments and without buildup. In fact, the most intense scene is the opening, with its stark and brutal portrayal of the plague.
Sadly, the film fails to recapture its sense of overwhelming doom and the rest of it feels stagnant.
Whether the admittedly lean script or the directing of Christopher Smith is to blame, Black Death suffers greatly from its failure to engage the audience, especially in the climax.
But where the script and direction fall flat, the acting compensates.
Instead of falling into clichés, as period pieces often do, the three leads give their characters nuances and unique tics.
Bean’s Ulric is a commanding figure, never shouting or getting angry, but always hinting at some seething conflict beneath his assured exterior. He brings a kind of fanaticism and driving motivation to his character that pushes through the poor pacing and gives Ulric more dynamic elements than the film would otherwise possess.
Osmund, the Marlowe figure in the film’s Conrad-esque approximation is a monk, but Redmayne does not create a naïve character. He’s worldly and keeps  secrets from his fellow monks. It’s a unique angle and ends up providing the crux of the film’s climax.
But the best performance comes from van Houten, who steals scenes from the moment she appears.
She is somehow able to master a commanding presence without ever reflecting rage or stubbornness.
Instead, she brings a coyness to Langiva. Compared to the film’s constant seriousness, this only adds to her and the village’s disturbing quality.
Sadly, even the actors can’t keep the film from failing.
There’s a great premise behind Black Death, but it is never fully explored.
The way people react to the plague is often brought up and the film could have been an exploration into human response to fear, but it never stops to capitalize this fear.
What audiences are left with is an indecisive period piece and a waste of a great cast. Black Death works as a look into a world and culture of constant morbidity. In the end, it’s a dead film.

Movie of the week: Jane Eyre – Premieres Friday
Yet another version of this literary canon novel is coming to theaters, this time featuring Mia Wasikowska, known most recently for the whimsical Alice in Wonderland and Oscar-nominated The Kids Are All Right. And remember the kid from 2000’s Billy Elliot? He’s St. John Rivers. Though the cast has to prove it can take on such classic and well known characters, the trailer gives hints of a genuinely creepy and thrilling adaptation that could very well breathe new life into this old story.

USC’s College of Letters, Arts & Sciences is all too often perceived as the university’s dowdy, bookish older sister.
In the wake of a recession that caused a 25.6 percent drop in USC’s endowment — one of the largest hits among private institutions in the country — and a hiring freeze that lasted two years, the College was not enjoying the same spoils as some of its flashy younger siblings.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The School of Cinematic Arts, for example, bolstered by a $175 million gift from alumnus George Lucas in 2006, launched a blitzkrieg construction project that culminated in the gilded building on 34th Street.
Last fall, the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism also struck gold with a $50 million donation for a new, 90,000-square-foot building that will house studios and newsrooms.
But despite its large student population — some 10,000 undergraduates and graduate students — the College didn’t have a George Lucas, someone to help improve old facilities, hire new faculty and build on a thinly stretched course catalogue.
Enter Dana and David Dornsife.
The university announced this week that the Dornsifes are donating an unprecedented $200 million to the College, the largest single gift in USC history.
What’s more, the donation is unrestricted, meaning the College can allocate funds as it sees fit.
And though the university has yet to announce specific plans, this newfound largesse can and should go where the College needs it most: hiring new faculty members and retaining the ones it has.
The university-wide hiring freeze ended in June, but it seems its effects are still being felt in the College, especially in the humanities departments.
Language departments, in my experience, have been stretched thin in the last few years. Some of my professors said they were taking on more classes in an attempt to beef up a dwindling course list.
The Spanish department, according to its website, encompasses the largest number of students of any foreign language at USC. Yet, it seems the department has a hard time accommodating the mass of students; at the beginning of each semester, registration stragglers often crowd the classes, hoping to get in.
Meanwhile, other languages have met gruesome ends. German is an all but dead language at USC today, as the department was dismantled in 2008, leaving only a handful of introductory classes and provisions for then-majors and minors to finish their degrees.
President C. L. Max Nikias, a man who deserves kudos for bringing in more than $300 million already in his short time at the helm of the university, emphasized the singularity of the donation in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
“This gift makes a big statement about the importance of the humanities and social sciences in the university, not just the sciences,” he told the Times. “It’s a very, very transformative gift.”
According to the Times, humanities and social sciences typically receive far less federal and private money than the natural sciences, which, until this week, rang true at USC.
The Dornsifes’ gift represents a milestone for USC and a loud vote of confidence for its humanities and social sciences programs.
And though construction of buildings will be important to house a burgeoning faculty, the university’s first priority should be ensuring the faculty is in fact burgeoning.
We can only hope USC heavily favors faculty growth in allocating the $200 million, the best way to support the College’s many students and its fewer, but no-less intrepid, professors who have weathered tough times.

Some money should go for a real investigation of the Kappa Sig email and cover-up!
yeah, i’m going to call “charlie sheen” and say that really isn’t topical anymore
George, some money should go to teaching graduate students about the principle of “innocent until proven guilty”, and maybe to your libel-defense fund.
A well-written piece from Mueller FTW.
I agree with the author that keeping current and attracting new faculty should be the top priority. Now is the time for USC to truly become an elite university.

Wall Street analyst Meredith Whitney declared on CBS’ 60 Minutes last December that the U.S. municipal bond market would experience 50-100 major defaults, totaling an apocalyptic net loss of “hundreds of billions of dollars.”
But the chaos has since faded, with rates actually declining significantly in some areas. It seems the speculation on default risk was just that — speculation.
Still, government default risk remains a problem, with one estimate pegging municipal default losses at $100 billion over the next five years. It remains unclear whether or not municipal bonds are out of the woods.
California is particularly susceptible to fluctuations in the municipal market, and it can hurt residents and impede the state’s economic growth.
Cities and towns in California have been hurt the most as a result of the municipal bond, or muni, fluctuations, as they are held to the same legal standards as the state — and are experiencing the same deep economic woes — but they do not enjoy the same ability to tap into large capital resources.
The City of Los Angeles is in particularly dire straits. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, after Los Angeles’ credit rating was downgraded last April, called for a twice-a-week shutdown of non-essential services to meet debt service obligations.
The cost of debt has risen as a result of the downgrade, and the volatility in the muni market has made it even more expensive for Los Angeles to issue debt for critical projects and to maintain current debt service payments.
The spike in muni yields has forced Los Angeles to use more money from both the general fund as well as the reserve fund, crowding out funding for desperately needed public services.
The state has its own budget problems and is in no position to extend meaningful aid to municipalities to help cover the cost of both debt service and public services.
Municipalities will have to seriously cut back their services or,  as has been done in a big way in Los Angeles, shrink the public employment ranks to meet debt obligations.
The key question remains just how much cutting will have to occur.
Conceivably, if the muni market has stabilized after being hammered for the last several months, yields could decline and free up resources for municipal project financing, debt repayment and service provision.
Conversely, if negative forecasts are to be believed, municipalities could still be majorly constrained, with perhaps the specter of bankruptcy on the nearer horizon.
Students might not understand the financial impact the suffering muni market has on their daily lives.
But as students look to find secure employment upon graduation, it is vital to know the economic conditions they will face beyond the protective walls of USC.
What happens to the muni market in the coming weeks will dictate not only the quantity of services municipalities can provide, but also the larger economic health of the nation.
Here in Los Angeles, that translates into the very real possibility that the long, painful road to economic recovery could get even tougher in the near future.

Another regular season is in the books for the USC women’s basketball team, and yet another laundry list of awards has been earned by junior forward Briana Gilbreath.
For the second year in a row, Gilbreath was honored for her defense as she was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year by the media.
Last year, Gilbreath was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year by the league’s coaches, along with Stanford’s Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.
Gilbreath earned a spot on both the Media All-Pac-10 team for the first time and the All-Pac-10 defensive team for the second time during her career at USC.
Although Gilbreath is the Women of Troy’s leading scorer and rebounder, she is also known for her defensive prowess.
She currently leads the team in steals and blocks and also ranks second and third in the Pac-10 in those categories, respectively.
Gilbreath was the only member for the Women of Troy to be named to the All-Pac-10 team and the All-Defensive team, although freshman Cassie Harberts was named the the All-Freshman team by the media.

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet will visit USC on May 3 for two events hosted by the USC Student Interfaith Council.
“We are very excited that the Dalai Lama has accepted the USC Student Interfaith Council’s invitation to speak on campus. We see this as an extraordinary and unique opportunity and are very excited for this to take place,” said Varun Soni, dean of religious life at USC.
The first event will take place in the morning at the Galen Center where the Dalai Lama will give a public talk on such topics as secular ethics, religious pluralism and the relationship between spirituality and science. A question-and-answer session moderated by Dr. James Doty, a board member of the Dalai Lama Foundation, will follow the lecture.
The Dalai Lama will participate in a panel of scholars including Antonio Damasio, USC professor of neuroscience, and Gideon Yaffe, USC professor of philosophy and law, in another event on May 3 in the afternoon at Bovard Auditorium to talk about consciousness, cognition and contemplation.
Tickets will go on sale online Saturday, March 12 and over the phone Monday, March 14. Students will be able to receive a discounted price of $20 each for up to four tickets at either event.
USC faculty and staff are eligible to buy up to two tickets for a discounted rate of $50 each for the event taking place in Bovard Auditorium. Proceeds from both events will be donated to the Dalai Lama Foundation. Students should also expect to receive an e-mail from the USC Ticket Office with additional information about pricing and availability.
I have just read through the comments on this page. I am not a USC student or faculty, but my taxes go toward education just like everyone else. If this is a cross-section of the students (and future possible leaders) of this country then God help us all. Education is supposed to broaden the mind and that cannot happen unless you grab every opportunity that presents itself.
1.2 million Tibetans have lost their lives since the Chinese invasion in the 1950s and a unique culture has been almost decimated. The Tibetan people recognise the Dalai Lama as their spiritual and secular leader. The Dalai Lama himself has said that this is an outdated approach and is beginning the process of stepping aside so that the Tibetans can vote for a secular leader as in other countries.
This is one of the greatest spiritual persons of our time, you would do well to listen and to learn; at least then you can say that you have an informed opinion instead of an ignorant one brainwashed by the media.
It is a woeful shame that there are some adverse negative remarks about the DL; but that is ok because everyone is entitled to their own opinions without the fear of being persecuted.
I believe what Buddhism preaches is to be compassionate to all living things, whether human, animal, plant, etc.  To show show compassion is to hopefully better this world that we live in.  We are all pieces of this world and if it looks like we are falling apart in some areas then we should take it upon ourselves to try to piece together what has fallen apart.
Compassion starts with ones-self and from within.  Once you find that compassion you can then go out and help others and you hope that they in turn will find compassion within themselves and to help other as you had helped them.
There will always be differences and that’s what makes this world interesting and dynamic; however, the commonality that we should all strive for is to be compassionate to each other.
From my understanding, the Dalai Lama is coming to speack about Buddhist teaching and the relationship between these teachings and science. The fusion between Buddhism and science has been discussed and promoted by various Buddhist master. It is a very interesting perspective to use science to explain Buddhist teachings. It will be a great learning experience. It is funny how some people are so bigoted. Thought that USC was attracting better students these days.
He used to a slave owner and now is a miserable man who lost political power, just like Mubarak who cannot face the history and his people. Now all he want is the pursuit of power covered by some ridiculous religion meanings. Shame on him.
I am so disappointed about this event.
Why are they bringing former salve owners to USC??  Read Michael parentis research on the the dalia Lama… Criminals..
I have to say i’m so disappointed in the perspective of some Chinese-Americans at USC that really believe in the rhetoric of the PRC.  Wake up!!  I love China and i’ve been there many times, but they have wielded such oppressive control of their people…the Dalai Lama has never attacked or invaded anyone.  He is an activist, a Buddhist, and a proponent for peace, if you ever read anything by him you’d know he supports a peaceful union of Tibet and China.  Understanding this will be a challenge for many, many people.  What are you so afraid of?  Is it YOU thinking for yourself or just all of the PRC propaganda you’ve heard your whole life?
Do you know what happened in 03/ 14 / 2008  in Tibet?! Do you know what happened in England during the Olympic torch relay ,.If you don’t know, search that first , then tell us what does DaLai’s peace mean~
Have you ever been to Tibet, China? No. All the things you know is just from the CNN, BBC and other western news, sad for you.
The dalia lama is a CIA asset to undermine Chima.. He is a former slave owner.. You really know nothing when you make such insane statements.
He’s totally a traitor and slaveholder, Do Americans supoort traitor and slaveholder?
Yes, we do!
@Williams i’m baffled by your statement, were you planning on supporting that with anything or do you just like throwing our non-sequitur shock statements?  You have no idea what you are saying and it’s a pity because you have the opportunity in your lifetime to see a pivotal leader of peace and unity and here you are making some comment about him being a slaveholder.  What bizarre, parallel  universe do you live in?  What if I just called your parents traitors and Nazis?  Does that make it true, can I support that?  No I can’t, moreover i’m sure it’s ludicrous and untrue…check your head and your heart.
Strongly object!!!
Why?
I’m just going to go ahead and state the obvious– the last 12 comments have all been posted by the same person. And they have horrible grammar. Clever.
Unfortunately for you, smart-alec! By the way, could you please show me your perfect grammar in Chinese when expressing your idea?
Sure. Also, you completely missed the point of my post.
Your point is ridiculous, because your judgement is really problematic.
object such politically biased event on campus!!!
Life is political, education is political, get used to it.  You attend a PRIVATE University, which is a blessing because more perspectives can be shared.  Don’t hide and insulate yourself from the first thing that threatens your world view.  You’re in for a lot of heartache if that’s how you do.
Damn you, MarsMc!!! Dalai is a big idiot!! What he can do is to bring insult to the Chinese!!!!!!
You sound so Chinese when you say that.
LOL
所有有良心的中国人，都应该站出来反对或抗议这两所美国大学！！！！
Damn you, Dalai Lama! Damn all his followers!! If you go hungry, will you still do all these stupid things? You’re all big troublemakers and betrayers of the Chinese People!
okay this is seriously retarded…
that’s like saying Geronimo was a betrayer of the American people
totally ridiculous
Chinese nationalistic propaganda makes me sick!
I have nothing against Chinese people, but I firmly stand with the Tibetan people on this issue and welcome His Holiness to the campus!
You’re threatening dissenters with starvation? Really?
同学们 咆哮吧！！！！！！！尼玛的一张门票还20刀！！！！！20刀还只是折扣价有没有！！！！！！！！！尼玛的奥巴马来演讲的时候都免费的！！！！！尼玛的钱不要太多啊！！！！！！居然还要捐给达赖喇嘛做基金！！！！捐你妹啊捐！！！！！！！！！！！
Object!
Can’t believe there is Chinese in such stupid council!
Totally Object!!
It is really a shame to invite him to speech at USC.
This man will not be welcome by all the Chinese students in USC!
哥特么到了美帝还是逃不了被代表的命运啊我去，这尼玛哥要咆哮啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！有没有！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
I thought all chinese students share the pain of being “represented”.
Anyway, I will go to listen to him,
not because I think he is right, but I believe it is necessary to listen to someone before judging him.
Because all Chinese think the same?!  Are you crazy?!  I understand that China is a socially collectivist culture but you DO NOT speak for all Chinese.
I hope we’re not paying him an honorarium or his expenses.
object !!!!
I am a USC Professor and I object such politically biased event on campus.
You object to having students hear someone speak?  Don’t you think USC’s students are intelligent enough to decide for themselves the merits of the speaker’s words?  If not, you really shouldn’t be teaching!
He just objected such events, not objected students attending such events. You really have a good imagination!
But if the events don’t occur, then logically students don’t get the chance to attend them. The university atmosphere is a great opportunity for students to be exposed to unfamiliar ideas, even if they don’t agree with them.
Then your an idiot and you belong elsewhere.  I wouldn’t want you as a professor.  If I knew Dr.King might be a guest speaker and some teacher objected i’d run them out on a rail, you don’t belong in academia if you REALLY are a professor, which I highly doubt.
USC professor is NOT a USC professor.  No self-respecting, tenured or part-time Prof would post some contrite little blurb on a student forum.  If they did, well, may God help us all.
Are you kidding me ? I can not believe USC invite a person who seems to be a religious leader but actually a politician.
Are you retarded?
Umm… didn’t Obama just come and speak?  Why shouldn’t USC invite politicians, religious leaders, scientists, musicians and anyone culturally relevant to speak to students?  Jack Kemp spoke at my USC commencement ceremony, I don’t remember anyone objecting.
Are you serious? Obama is totally different from Dalai Lama! It is so unbelievable you thought they are comparable! When Obama came for public speech, there were many people objecting around the campus. For your commencement ceremony, there must also be some people objecting, though you didn’t remember. Why should USC invite any politicians, religious leaders, scientists to speak to students? If Adolf Hitler were still alive, following your logic, USC should invite him with great honor? It’s our freedom to object inviting Dalai Lama, which is none of your business.
Did you really just compare bringing a nobel peace prize recipient to bringing Adolph Hitler…wow…what a great example of your point. honestly get over it…If certain students don’t want to participate they don’t have to…just like any other event on this campus.
I think you misunderstood what I said. I didn’t try to compare Obama to Adolph Hitler. My point is that it is ridiculous to invite anyone who only meets the criteria of being politicians, religious leaders or scientists. I just want to show my objection, not asking or forcing others not to participate any event on campus. By the way, I always treat Obama’s receiving the Nobel Peace Prize as a joke. And it is the same with Dalai Lama.
lol
Inviting politicians, religious leaders, and scientists (especially scientists!) to speak to students is something that all universities do. Being exposed to lots of perspectives and world views is part of college life. And I still don’t understand the comparison to Hitler – that’s not a rational or effective analogy to make. USC has every right to invite the Dalai Lama to speak and you have every right to object; I just don’t understand why, in your mind, him being a religious/political leader makes him unworthy to be invited.
I agree with Dee.
You can protest all you want, but one of the most important things about college, I think, is gaining a more worldly view of how sh*t works/thinks/believes/etc.. You won’t learn crap if you keep shutting down anything remotely considered to be outside your beliefs or views. 
With that said, if Adolf Hitler were alive and to speak at our school… I’D ATTEND IN A HEARTBEAT. Not because I think he’s a great guy, but because he mattered.
Can we stop talking about Hitler now?
Yes, they are.  They fail to realize that one of the benefits of a private education is a diversification of ideas and perspectives…maybe they’ll never learn that.  Everyone here who is hating would much rather have some speaker that fuels their confirmation biases, rather than open them up.  I hate to say it but I suspect most of these posts objecting to the Dalai Lama are coming from 18-21 year old undergrads that are just regurgitating the rhetoric of their mom and dad…sigh, so sad.

On March 3, Lady Gaga performed “Born This Way” at her concert in Toronto with the 10-year-old YouTube sensation, Maria Aragon. The avant-garde performer brought the young star on the rise out on stage to sit on her lap and sing an emotional duet of the smash-hit single.
Aragon reached this high-status gig through uploading her video featuring her soulful voice and lovely piano accompaniment in a rendition of “Born This Way” on YouTube on February 16. She has already received close to 20 million views.
This is only the first among many videos.  The young starlet also did covers of Beyoncé’s “Listen” and Bruno Mars’s “Just the Way You Are.”
Gaga stated emotional and teary-eyed at the concert, “knowing that I touched one person means the world.” If Aragon has the power to make Lady Gaga cry, then clearly she is a force to be reckoned with. She proves talent comes in many shapes and sizes and that YouTube serves a bigger purpose than to provide a multitude of funny cat videos.

GK Films has announced that it will reboot the Tomb Raider film franchise and aim to release the first installment in 2013.
Based on the successful video game franchise of the same name, the fairly succesful 2001 and 2003 film versions starred a supple Angelina Jolie and together grossed a total of $432 million at the box office.
The game will also benefit from its own reboot; Crystal Dynamics announced in December that they it is developing a prequel game of the original 1996 game, which follows the adventures of Lara Croft, a sexy Indiana Jones-type character that, well, raided tombs.
No announcements have been made on any casting decisions, but the film will call Graham King and Tim Headington its producers. Headington has produced titles such as Rango,The Tourist and The Young Victoria, while King worked as producer for The Town, The Departed and Traffic.

USC has received its largest single donation since the university was established in 1880.
Dana and David Dornsife, longstanding patrons of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute and the university’s neuroscience program, have donated $200 million in an unrestricted endowment to the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, which will now become the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
“This historic investment by Dana and David Dornsife in USC’s humanities, social sciences and sciences — the largest naming gift in the history of higher education for a college of letters, arts and sciences — is both transformational and inspirational,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a press release. “Even more remarkable is that this unqualified support comes during such a challenging time for many in higher education.”
Nikias has only been president of the university for about seven months, but USC has already received three sizeable donations.
When Nikias was inaugurated Oct. 15, trustee Ming Hsieh announced a $50 million donation to the university for cancer research, and the Annenberg Foundation announced a $50 million donation to construct a new building for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
This donation from the Dornsifes, however, is unrestricted and will allow the College to decide how and when to spend the money.
“The College of Letters, Arts & Sciences plays a vital role in the life of USC, and we wanted our support to be unrestricted in order to give the university lasting flexibility,” David Dornsife said in the same press release. “We firmly believe that the College will lead the way in solving the major problems facing society and the world today.”
The gift is not targeted to a specific cause, though it is expected to be used for faculty hiring, research and fellowships, according to the Los Angeles Times, which broke the story Tuesday night.
The university will also implement a new Dornsife Scholars Program to recognize impressive seniors who graduate from the College and plan to continue their academic pursuits and study social challenges on a national and worldwide scale.
“Dana and David’s gift demonstrates their deep understanding of a basic truth — that all human progress and enlightenment rest on a firm foundation of outstanding scholarly inquiry across traditional and emerging fields within letters, arts and sciences,” Howard Gillman, dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, said in the press release.
David Dornsife graduated from USC in 1965 and is a USC trustee. He is also the chairman of the Herrick Corporation, the largest steel fabricator on the West Coast. Dana Dornsife graduated from Drexel University and is the founder of the Lazarex Cancer Foundation.
The $200 million donation by the Dornsifes is larger than the donation by Star Wars creator George Lucas, which helped to design a new building for the School of Cinematic Arts. Lucas donated $175 million in 2006.
Currently, the single largest gift to any college or university in the United States is the $600 million from Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel Corp., his wife Betty and their foundation, given to the California Institute of Technology in 2001, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The College enrolls about 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students, has 33 academic departments and 31 research centers and institutes.
The College will permanently be known as the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences following a celebration in Bovard Auditorium on March 23 at 11 a.m.
Wow, Mr. & Mrs. Dornsife!  Congrats.  That’ll be some tax write-off.
I wish people would donate anonymously, and not ask for things like “naming” rights and recognition.  That would, I think, make the gift more sincere and valuable (as opposed to gauche and self-absorbed).
You really have no inside information to this donation, so it’s really not for you to say they should donate anonymously they do that all the time. It wasn’t they choice to have it publicized they were asked to so they agreed. You should read up on all the amazing things they do (not for tax write offs) that don’t get published in the media. I don’t see how people can view this as anything but sincere and generous, something to help the future of our country, our youth.
This is wonderful news, since public schools money goes all to the teachers unions. FIGHT ON!
Really? It is going to pass schools that have long been better academically because of this money? Ignoring the fact that many of schools have just as much if not more money, the biggest issues is that USC undergrads are not as intellectual as at other top schools. They need to change the campus culture before they will move into the elite.
Oh” someone’s jealous, probably goes to public school too.
INCREDIBLE! USC will use this money to continue to climb the rankings into the top 10 Universities!
It would be nice to hear some specifics on how the money will be spent. It is a major boost for USC though. Maybe they will actually have some top 10 departments in the future.
They just announced the gift. In all likelihood, they won’t receive the money for awhile (assuming it’s a vesting gift) or won’t be able to liquidate it quickly (if say, it’s in the form of stock). Therefore, although the money has been pledged, how can they even decide what to do with it when they don’t even have it yet (much less know how much cash will be the result)?
It is so refreshing to hear stories like this, especially in the midst of budget cuts – which seem to be aimed toward education and social services. Fight on!

“My daughter is my motivation, she got me through that final week of midterms at USC.”
This isn’t a phrase heard very often USC. Yet, this was the life of a former USC student, Brittani Marinez, who graduated this last winter with a degree in sociology.
Precious · Brittani Marinez, who graduated this past December, said her daughter Zoë Rose was her inspiration to continue her education. - Courtesy of Brittani Marinez 
Marinez is not the only person to balance raising a child while pursuing a bachelor’s degree here at USC; Cindy Nguyen, who will graduate this May with a degree in business administration, is also raising a child.
According to the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Educational Statistics, an estimated 13 percent of college undergraduates claimed one or more dependents on the 2003-2004 report. A release of updated information has yet to be provided.
Both Marinez and Nguyen said that from the time they became pregnant, they were determined to continue with school and pursue a degree to set an example for their daughters.
Marinez found out she was pregnant three months after her high school graduation.
“I was really young, and my initial decision was to have an abortion at Planned Parenthood,” Marinez said. “I was in the waiting room and God intervened in my life and I walked right out. I trusted God, and decided to keep my baby.”
At the time, Marinez worked at a retail store in her local mall while attending Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif. Once her daughter Zoë Rose was born, Marinez quit her job and focused completely on school.
“I got really close to my sociology professor, and he made an effort to reach out to me,” Marinez said. “One day he asked if I could go to any college, what college would I choose, and I said USC was my dream school. But I didn’t have the grades or the money.”
Marinez’s professor mentored her, helped her push through college and recommended various programs she could get involved in to help with raising her child. Marinez eventually picked up her grades, made the honors program and got into USC.
“In August of 2008, I found out that I got into USC,” Marinez said. “I really felt like I had made it for my daughter and for myself. It was my greatest accomplishment.”
Nguyen had a slightly different experience than Marinez, as she got pregnant while she was a student at USC.
“I transferred to USC from Long Beach City College,” Nguyen said. “I took a year off USC to get married, and when I came back second semester, I got pregnant.”
Nguyen was 24 when she became pregnant, and the birth of her daughter, Jade, inspired her to achieve in school.
“When I had my baby girl, it changed my life,” Nguyen said. “If I was focused before the baby, after I am motivated to what I was doing 10 times more. Because of this, I came back to USC this year, and I’m trying to finish up.”
Nguyen said her professors didn’t treat her any differently when they discovered she was pregnant.
“I never used my baby as an excuse for anything unless it was a doctor’s appointment that I had to go to,” Nguyen said. “When my professors did find out I had a baby, they’d be like, ‘Oh my gosh! How do you do it?’”
Nguyen has yet to graduate, but she single-handedly runs her own business, The Art of Make Up. Nguyen’s business is a make-up school, shop and salon that was established last May. Located in Orange County, the shop has already established a credible clientele list.
Both Marinez and Nguyen acknowledged challenges during their pregnancies. Some days, they missed classes for doctor’s appointments, and their overall college experience was very different from the norm.
“When I was pregnant, I didn’t get morning sickness,” Nguyen said. “But when my baby was born and I went back to school, it was much more complicated because anytime the baby needed something, I’d have to take the day off school.”
Marinez explained that she didn’t have the typical college experience because she lived off campus and spent nearly two hours in traffic both ways.
“I pushed so hard to graduate for my daughter and myself, but being at USC and being a parent made my college experience very different from my peers,” Marinez said. “Class, work, Zoë. That was my life for three years.”
Despite the difficulties that come with parenting at a relatively young age, Nguyen said Jade was the primary reason she pursued her now-successful business.
“I was thinking of her most of the time,” Nguyen said. “I want to become a better person for my baby.”
Marinez said everything she had to endure was worth it.
“My main motivation in graduating was so when Zoë is older, she can’t say [school] is too hard because she had me as her example,” she said.
Puhleez Debra, don’t proselytize here. College is all about honing intellect via broadening perspectives, discovering alternative points of view, etc. USC isn’t some religious-affiliated school…we’re no longer the fighting Methodists. You’re like 5 decades too late.
Britt, I’m glad you’re a strong CHRISTIAN woman with an awesome testimony, and strong voice~~ (Psalms 28:6 DR) 6 Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
(Psalms 28:7 DR) 7 The Lord is my helper and my protector: in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped. And my flesh hath flourished again, and with my will I will give praise to him.
Brit, You are a blessing, and Love that you are a strong Christian woman, who has a voice~~ (Psalms 28:6 DR) 6 Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
(Psalms 28:7 DR) 7 The Lord is my helper and my protector: in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped. And my flesh hath flourished again, and with my will I will give praise to him.
“I was really young, and my initial decision was to have an abortion at Planned Parenthood,” Marinez said. “I was in the waiting room and God intervened in my life and I walked right out. I trusted God, and decided to keep my baby.”
More anti-female pro-life rhetoric from the DT. This is disgusting.
I don’t know that the Daily Trojan had too much to do with it. Just because she decided to do something based on what she felt was spiritual influence, I don’t see that including her view was part of some sort of DT pro-life agenda.
Clearly you didn’t see that ‘PP is an abortion factory’ opinion piece a few days back.

Los Angeles residents headed to the polls Tuesday for the municipal elections, but voter turnout was low in precincts across the city.
Ballot · Voting booths were set up at USC Hillel, the firestation on Jefferson Boulevard and Marks Tower yesterday, but few students voted. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
USC and most of its students lie within the 8th District, one of the most hotly contested seats in this year’s elections. As of 11:30 p.m. Tuesday night, Councilman Bernard Parks had received 54.16 percent of the vote with two out of 95 precincts reporting. Forescee Hogan-Rowles, who received a large amount of support from local unions, had received 41.29 percent of the vote and Jabari Jumaane, a Los Angeles Fire Department firefighter and USC alum, had 4.56 percent.
The ballot measures in this year’s elections generally focused on fixing the city’s finances and included a proposition to curtail pension benefits for future hires in the fire and police departments, a proposition to prevent raids on the city’s reserve fund and a proposition to set aside more money for libraries hit hard by budget cuts.
As of 11:30 p.m., the early returns shows that 63.38 percent of voters favored the Public Library Funding and 72.74 percent of voters favored the Fire and Police Pension Plan.
“The big issue in any election, particularly with City Hall, is the budget deficit and the impact it will have on city services like fire services, libraries and city safety,” said David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for USC. “Another huge issue in the 8th District is economic development.”
Galaviz added the university plays a major role in assisting the rest of the 8th District in dealing with these issues.
“USC has a history of being a strong civic leader with local government, including partnerships with community members for improving safety and hiring locally,” he said. “We have to continue being a stable job provider and economic development engine.”
Despite the issues facing the 8th District on this year’s ballot, several polling places around USC reported low voter turnout.
At 4:30 p.m., volunteers at the polling place at USC Hillel on Hoover Street reported having just 15 voters since polls opened at 7 a.m. The fire station on Jefferson Avenue reported 20 voters, and the polling station at Marks Tower on campus reported only two  voters.
“I don’t think the ballot measures are something that the students are interested in, because it’s not a high-profile type of election,” said Veronica Cavanaugh, a volunteer working at Marks Tower. “I truly believe if it was like a presidential election they would all be here.”
Cavanaugh also said the polling place had many more students registered to vote in the precinct, and they are hoping more students would submit ballots through the mail.
Many students agreed the local elections simply weren’t enough to capture their attention.
Lu Li, a first-year graduate student studying social work, was not aware of the elections until he walked into the lobby of Marks Tower to play billiards.
“I saw everything set up and some people coming in, but I didn’t know what they were voting for,” Li said.
Low numbers of students turned out to the polls to vote, but the overall importance of political engagement was not lost on many students.
“I didn’t vote because I am an international student, but I still think it is important for students to participate in local elections, especially for U.S. citizens,” said Shuo Wang, a first-year graduate student studying computer science.
Galaviz said that despite low voter turnout for a city election, USC students generally know what is happening in their community and remain relatively engaged.
“They have a good amount of knowledge and a strong track record of being civically engaged,” Galaviz said. “They see the impact of the city budget situation on their everyday lives. The university does not exist in a vacuum; students are directly impacted by local policy in terms of economic development, parks, libraries and other local services.”

Students often invoke free speech to justify on-campus demonstrations, but there are no clear-cut guidelines for protection of free speech at USC, Stephen Yamaguchi, university counsel, said at the “Campus Conversation: Free Speech” panel held Tuesday.
Student Affairs and the Political Student Assembly sponsored the event, which was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum.

Yamaguchi and Peter Steinwachs, associate fellow at the Gould School of Law, led the discussion, which around 30 students and staff attended.
Yamaguchi and Steinwachs gave a presentation on the First Amendment, its history and its application to universities. Yamaguchi emphasized the interpretive nature of legal rights.
“All rights are not absolute, in the sense that there are many other considerations,” Yamaguchi said. “There are other interests who have other concerns that are also legitimate, such as the right to privacy and certain property rights.”
Free speech can only be restricted to serve a legitimate interest, and alternatives should be offered if possible, according to Yamaguchi.
“If a group of people picket in front of a library and people can’t get into the library and students need to do that, then we can move that group to a new location,” Steinwachs said. “This is a reasonable alternative.”
Yamaguchi said there were no specific guidelines for protesting on campus, but that students generally should avoid interfering with academic or business affairs.
“You’ve got to know what your rights are and stand up for [them],” he said. “It’s not easy, but that’s what you’ve got to do.”
Yamaguchi also led a question-and-answer session that revealed problems students had with the way free speech is currently handled at USC.
Some students said they wanted to know the specific guidelines for expressing free speech on campus to avoid problems.
Clayton Elliott, a junior majoring in economics, thinks the lack of clear guidelines is not a bad thing.
“A lot of these laws are laws you have to fight for yourself,” Elliott said. “Not everyone in the world is going to do everything they can to accommodate you.”
Heather Larabee, assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities, said her department wants to make sure students are able to express themselves on campus by training all Dept. of Public Safety officers to carefully handle protesting students.
“It’s helpful if we know in advance, because then we can go to DPS and say, ‘We know this is happening, here’s a heads up,’” Larabee said. “We don’t want to interfere with an event, but we want both things to happen ­­— we want the protest to happen and for the event to happen.”
Sherry Wang, a freshman majoring in creative writing, said she had hoped to learn more about the university’s specific guidelines regarding free speech.
“I came here because I wanted to see what the campus’s actual policies were, but I felt like the information they gave was actually kind of vague,” Wang said.
Yamaguchi said the frustration students feel about restrictions on their right to protest should energize them about their causes.
“I’m very encouraged when I can hear directly from students who are committed and passionate about their causes because it demonstrates that the university has a community that cares about what’s going on in the world,” Yamaguchi said.
