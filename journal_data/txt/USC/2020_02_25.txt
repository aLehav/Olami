Hot Pockets heiress Michelle Janavs was sentenced to five months in prison Tuesday for her involvement in the college admissions scandal. Janavs paid $300,000 to falsify her two daughters’ ACT test scores and help her older daughter gain admission to USC as a false beach volleyball recruit in 2018.
Federal prosecutors had initially recommended a 21-month prison sentence for Janavs’ involvement in Operation Varsity Blues along with three years of supervised release and a $175,000 fine. Janavs was sentenced to two years of supervised release and has been fined $250,000, according to a release from the Department of Justice.  
Janavs pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Janavs’ defense filed a memorandum in court Thursday requesting probation in lieu of prison time, citing Janavs’ generosity and compassion. The memorandum quoted character references solicited from Janavs’ friends that portrayed her participation in the scandal as out of character. In the document, the defense stated that admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer convinced Janavs that partaking in  it was the only way to secure her daughter’s admission to college.
According to the memorandum, the University rescinded Janavs’ oldest daughter’s offer of conditional admission and prohibited her from ever reapplying. USC said it was unable to comment on the status of her daughter’s admission or relationship with the University, citing student privacy laws.
Janavs’ oldest daughter withdrew from the other schools she applied to and enrolled in a community college, the memorandum stated. Both she and her younger sister were prohibited from attending events at their private high school after the scandal was released, and her sister enrolled at a public school.
Janavs began working with Singer in 2017 to falsify her oldest daughter’s ACT score. Her daughter took the exam at the West Hollywood Test Center, where Singer’s designated test administrator and proctor gave her extended time and corrected her answers. Her application to USC the following year included the falsified test score, according to court documents. Janavs also sought admission for her daughter as an athletic recruit. 
Court documents indicate that former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel presented her athletic profile to the admissions subcommittee, falsely describing her as the winner of several California beach volleyball tournaments. Her daughter played indoor volleyball in high school but did not play competitive beach volleyball, according to documents.
Janavs also falsified her second daughter’s ACT score in 2018 after applying for extended time and paying Singer’s test-taker to correct her answers. The younger daughter, who was a junior when the scandal was made public, did not submit her ACT score to any colleges, according to the memorandum.
Former assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke will be sentenced in April for falsifying athletic recruitment profiles for seven college applicants, including five to USC. Prosecutors recommended a sentence at the lower end of the federal sentencing spectrum, according to the Department of Justice.
Five other parents involved in Operation Varsity Blues at USC have been sentenced since the scandal broke in March. Former Pimco executive Douglas Hodge was sentenced to nine months in prison earlier this month and was fined $750,000 for paying $850,000 to secure four of his children’s admissions to schools, including USC, as fake athletic recruits and attempting to secure his fifth child’s college admission. Of the 36 parents named in the admissions scandal, 19 are tied to USC.

The No. 10 USC women’s lacrosse team improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2016 with wins over Boston College and San Diego State this past weekend. The Trojans’ strong performances led two players on the roster — junior goalie Riley Hertford and graduate attacker Emily Concialdi — to earn Pac-12 Defensive and Offensive Players of the Week titles, respectively.
The Trojans defeated Boston College 18-9 on the heels of a 10-8 win over No. 14 Michigan State to improve to 2-0 over ranked opponents and hand the Eagles their worst loss since February 2017.
USC traded goals with the Eagles early as the game was tied 3-3 before the Trojans rallied off 6 straight goals in the span of three minutes and 42 seconds. Head coach Lindsey Munday said the week of preparation beforehand translated to the game. 
“We know B.C. is a really strong team,” Munday said. “So, we had to battle [and] really compete every day in practice so that we were as prepared as possible.” 
Seven different players contributed to the Trojans’ season-high 11 goals. Munday attributed the success of the attackers to the chemistry between them. 
“The attack really trusts one another,” Munday said. “[They did] not settle for a good shot but [waited] for a great one and [I am] really proud of the way the attack did that today.” 
Concialdi credited her highlight play early in the first half — in which she stole the ball from the goalkeeper and found the empty net — as a spark for her big afternoon. 
“Getting a snag from the goalie really hyped me up,” Concialdi said. “From there, [I] just wanted to keep it rolling … My teammates set me up for success.” 
Despite the energy from the win, things started slow for the Trojans against SDSU Sunday as clock problems led to a prolonged delay just seconds into the game. SDSU was able to jump on top first with a 2-0 lead, which would mark the Trojans’ third-straight game giving up the opening goal at home and their second time in three games falling behind 2-0. 
“I think we lost our discipline all over the field and we lost with some decision making in the clear and offensively,” Munday said. “Just making sure that we are playing within ourselves and not giving them opportunities.”
The Trojans answered back by rattling off 13 goals in a row and took a commanding 13-2 lead with just under 12 minutes to go in the second half. Junior midfielder Kelsey Huff recorded her first hat trick this season, her 15th as a Trojan.
“For me, I just wanted to work well with my teammates,” Huff said. “I feel like once we did get into our rhythm, we were able to help each other, and I think that’s how I got my openings.”
The Trojans would close the afternoon with a 14-6 win, and once again had eight different goal-scorers. Although it seemed like a solid win on paper, both Huff and Munday felt the Trojans could have played better.
“I think we had to fight today,” Munday said. “I don’t think it was our best day. San Diego State really pushed us. They are a really physical, gritty team and so we had to get back to basics and trust the game plan and trust each other.”
USC had a season-high 19 turnovers against SDSU. 
“We want [to be] more dynamic,” Huff said. “I feel like at points we got a little close and clustered a little bit and just being able to react off each other instead of being more confused.”
USC will get ready for Pac-12 play as it faces Stanford on March 6 at Soni McAlister Field at 3 p.m.

The future of football has been in question for some time now.
In April, the National Federation of High School Associations reported that participation in the sport has declined by 6.5% in the eight years since its peak in 2009-10, largely due to the increased awareness of football-related concussions.
Despite all of this, I urge you to consider that there has never been a better time to get into the game if you have what it takes.
I’m not saying that head injuries aren’t a valid concern for parents and players alike. The choice of whether to start playing football — and whether to stick with it — is completely personal. However, the opportunities presented to those who want to play at the highest level have never been better.
Let’s start with the most recent development in the professional world: the XFL. This league allows former and future NFL players to demonstrate their talent on a major stage. Players who may not have the ability to make a roster at the highest level can still get experience competing professionally and playing in front of a large crowd.
An average player in the XFL earns between $43,890 and $66,110, with quarterbacks reportedly earning above the NFL rookie minimum of $495,000. That’s pretty decent compensation for 10 weeks of living out one’s dream on the football field.
Former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones made just one appearance in four years with the NFL but is now the starting signal-caller for the D.C. Defenders.
“It’s giving me an opportunity to be a leader of a team, the opportunity to start and try to do something special [with D.C.] and win a championship,” Jones said in a press release.
L.A. Wildcats wide receiver Nelson Spruce suffered a season-ending injury during his rookie preseason in the NFL and never managed to return to a regular-season roster. In the XFL, Spruce has quickly become a fan favorite, already garnering chants of “Spruuuuuce” from the home crowd after his catches. His 256 yards and two touchdowns through just three games this season are already making a case for a possible return to the NFL.
“My family is involved with nutrition and fitness, so I’ve helped out a lot with that and will eventually transition into that,” Spruce said in a press release. “But right now, I’m trying to play football for as long as I can.”
I’ll acknowledge that this season, most of the names we’re seeing in the NFL are like Cardale and Spruce — players who have already created a reputation through established playing careers.
However, XFL commissioner Oliver Luck said on the “Dan Patrick Show” that the league may further depart from NFL tradition by recruiting college freshmen and sophomores in the future. The NFL currently requires players to be three years removed from high school before entering the draft. 
If the XFL goes in this direction, it could change the lives of student-athletes who want that professional competition under their belt or need to make money playing football before their third year of college. It could change the lives of student-athletes before beginning a potential NFL career.
Even within the NFL, though, football has become more inclusive as the league seeks talent from across vast geographical areas and walks of life. The NFL Combine in Indianapolis, Ind. — which began Sunday and runs through March 2 — features the typical high profile stars from big football programs, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts and Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins.
However, few casual fans realize that the NFL’s Combine “series” is more complex than the well-known Indianapolis event. It features five regional combines, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Combine and an international combine.
The first two offerings allow the NFL to evaluate athletes who were not invited to show off their talents in Lucas Oil Stadium but are draft-eligible and can no longer play college ball. At the end of the 2016 season, there were 96 players from regional combines on NFL rosters, making this part of the series a viable opportunity for lesser-known players to get their big break.
The NFL put on its first international combine in 2018 in Australia for players 21-25 years old interested in playing in the league, and the second iteration of the program was held in Germany last year. Eligible athletes are invited to train in the United States before hopefully making it to Indianapolis.
There are currently eight players on NFL rosters who were discovered in these international combines, including three former rugby players who translated their skills to the American game. So if you’re an NFL-caliber talent honing your craft abroad, there’s no better time to get involved than now.
Ultimately, whether you’re a young kid just getting started in the game or an ex-NFL player looking for what’s next, there’s no time like the present to make the leap toward a future in football.

The USC baseball team traveled to San Diego this past weekend to participate in the Tony Gwynn Classic at San Diego State.
USC beat Seattle University 6-2, lost to Southern Illinois 3-1 and took down SDSU in a comeback 11-5 victory. The Trojans are now 4-2 early in the season.
USC took on Seattle Friday in the first game of the event. The Redhawks were an unfamiliar opponent for the Trojans, as USC entered Friday with just a 2-0 all-time head-to-head advantage. 
The game started off quickly for the Trojans as USC scored three runs in the first inning thanks to a 3-run home run from sophomore first baseman Clay Owens, who finished with 4 RBIs. Juniors righty Kyle Hurt and lefty John Beller combined to allow just one earned run on the night as the Trojans coasted to the victory.
The Trojans took on another opponent they had not seen in more than 40 years when they played Southern Illinois Saturday. In USC’s second loss of the season, the Trojans could not find a way to get the bats going.
There were still some bright spots for the Trojans, however. Junior pitcher Isaac Esqueda pitched 5.1 innings while allowing only 2 runs on six hits with three strikeouts, and Owens added two hits out of just four on the day for USC.
In the final game of the Tony Gwynn Classic Sunday, USC took on a familiar opponent in SDSU. Having faced the Aztecs a total of 89 times, the Trojans got their 61st win against the Aztecs on a 5-run comeback win to cap off the weekend.
“I was actually pretty proud of them,” head coach Jason Gill said. “It was a long stretch. We didn’t hit well yesterday, and then the first five innings of the game today seemed to snowball into ‘Oh no, here we go again.’ It just takes one or two guys to break that open.”
It was SDSU, however, which started the game off hot, scoring 5 runs in the first four innings. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Alex Cornwell lasted only 3.2 innings, giving up 3 earned runs on nine hits for the Trojans a week after pitching 5.2 innings of 2-run ball against Western Michigan.
As for the Aztecs, sophomore pitcher Aaron Eden had a perfect first three innings before giving up a walk with two outs in the fourth. But it was only a matter of time before USC started its comeback. The Trojans put up 11 unanswered runs the rest of the game, including 2 in the seventh and 4 more in the ninth.
For the Trojans, freshman center fielder Rhylan Thomas finished the game with three hits and 2 runs while junior shortstop Ben Ramirez finished with three RBIs.
“[SDSU was] kinda pitching us backward, and to beat guys like that, you gotta use the whole field,” Gill said. “You can’t just sit up there and try to hit 500-foot home runs. What [Thomas and Ramirez] did was [they] went the other way with the baseball. And it paid off.”
USC will travel to face Cal State Fullerton before returning home to take on Keio University Tuesday and Wednesday. CSUF is 3-4 on the season despite having a historically strong program. On the other hand, Keio — a part of the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League that features six prominent baseball programs — will be traveling from Japan for an exhibition game.
“We gotta get on a little roll,” Gill said. “We have a tough matchup on Tuesday against Cal State Fullerton, and I know they just recently got ranked. So we got our hands full on Tuesday and that’s all we’re going to focus on.”

Midterm season is upon us, and that means subjective grading may bring a wave of disappointment to the halls of USC in the coming weeks. But a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that there may be a reason for hope: requesting a grade change is over 60% effective. The research also indicates that asking for a bump isn’t so rare: More than 40% of college students have, at some point in their undergraduate careers, approached a professor for a grade change. 
But there’s an interesting twist. The research shows that while women and men are similarly likely to ever ask for a grade change, male students ask for the change in a greater number of classes.  
Some, like the paper’s authors, suggest it may have something to do with confidence levels. In a follow up study, the researchers administered a test for a group of college students and awarded them fake grades without letting them see their corrected exams. They found that the percentage of male students that believed they performed better was higher than the percentage of female students. 
In a separate survey, the researchers asked college students for the reason they did not ask for a grade change. They found that the female students reported “feeling very high levels of stress if they had to ask.” 
The researchers took these results a step further and suggested they might in part explain the difference in pay between men and women. They cited different studies showing that female graduates are significantly less likely to ask for higher pay for study participation and even less likely to negotiate job offers. Other studies have concluded that women are more likely to be penalized for initiating negotiations, attain worse returns from negotiation when it is mandatory than when it is optional and make more generous offers or demand less when paired with men. They are also the most likely to reach an agreement when paired with women and less likely to initiate negotiation with men. 
The question then becomes whether the gender difference emerges before entering the labor market. In part, the answer to that question is yes, given the results of the study. However, an area that most definitely needs further study is which professors are most generous with grade bumps. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it might be likely adjunct or pre-tenure professors trying to bolster their reputation to gain those coveted tenure spots, incumbents of which might be less likely to negotiate grades with students. 
It’s difficult to provide the reason for the results. Perhaps women overall score higher on assignments than men and therefore don’t need to ask for a grade correction. Or perhaps  men are more likely to disregard potentially looking petty in the case of an unsuccessful attempt. It’s also possible that the professor’s gender is a factor in the equation. 
It looks like the study leaves readers with more questions than answers, but its results are something that college students should be aware of. Maybe if more students — particularly female students — recognize how common it is to ask for a grade bump, especially among their male counterparts, the data will correct itself. 
One guaranteed takeaway is this: Regardless of your gender, it’s worth asking a professor to bump your grade. If you never ask, you’ll never receive, and the odds they comply aren’t as low as you think.

In 2018, Instagram boasted one billion monthly active users. I would argue that around this time, the app reached its peak of infallibility. 
Being a social media influencer was burgeoning into a legitimate career path, and popular users like the Kardashians were spewing luxury porn content — 12-car garages, closets filled wall-to-wall with designer handbags — onto the platform in excess. It seems, though, that Instagram’s honeymoon phase has come to an end. 
While most of us (myself included) still use the app, perhaps more than we’d like to admit, the overarching sentiment has shifted from one of blind love to one of doubt and cynicism: We know the algorithm promotes content that is heavily produced and manufactured. We know the app favors fake shit. On top of that, growing anti-capitalist attitudes have led to criticism of the highly-publicized lives of the rich and famous. House tours featuring Kim Kardashian West’s walk-in fridge and Kylie Jenner’s multi-million dollar budgets for her toddler’s birthday party just aren’t hitting the right spots anymore. Shocker.	
In the face of Instagram’s soft power decline, one Chinese-owned app has taken over as social media’s favorite child: TikTok. TikTok currently has more than a billion users and was downloaded more than Instagram last year, and it’s only growing in popularity. In 2019, it was the third most downloaded app behind WhatsApp and Messenger and ahead of Instagram and Facebook — making it the only app in the top five that is not owned by Facebook.
There’s been a lot of talk about TikTok’s algorithm and how it curates users’ “For You” page. The thing is, no one outside of TikTok knows how the algorithm works; the company keeps its engagement metrics under wraps and declined to answer Vice’s specific questions. That being said, I’m less interested in the underlying mechanism than I am in the content that comes out of it. 
Somehow, unlike Instagram, platforms such as TikTok (along with Twitter and YouTube to a certain extent) manage to put content in the hands of the average person, not the Jenners of the world, but normal college students like you and me. It is an emerging pocket of the internet, one that often spurs higher-quality, more honest and raw content. 
The videos that go viral and gain traction are low-production, low-budget and highly relatable. They are filmed in college dorms, in passenger seats, in parking lots and backyards. They make light of common frustrations, bits and pieces of everyday life most people feel a personal connection to, rather than dangle unattainable wealth or unrealistic body standards before our eyes.
For the most part, good content reaches the “For You” page on TikTok on the basis of its current engagement rather than users’ popularity or its high-budget endorsements. Popular Youtuber James Charles tweeted: “can’t believe i’m saying this but TikTok has, by far, the best algorithm of any social media platform. every single user has an equal opportunity to have their content seen & go viral, AND they haven’t completely sold out to billion dollar advertisers… yet. @instagram take notes.” YouTuber Casey Neistat responded: “Truth.”
The way I see it, the internet is becoming more multifaceted and diversified every day, such that there seems to be two big streams you can fall into on social media. One side is all about content that is designed to be by creators and advertisers and constitutes much of Instagram’s popular output. The other side — where TikTok lies —  sees the proliferation of content that is largely a byproduct of normal life. This brand of content exudes the texture of authenticity and caters to internet-goers who seek genuine relatability and community.
In short, TikTok’s mysterious algorithm is getting at something big. It is particularly more elusive than other social media platforms, and I would argue that is because it is an algorithm that promotes authentic content. Naturally, this makes it unpredictable, difficult to master and far less conducive to the culture of social media we’re accustomed to. 
TikTok poses a growing threat to Instagram, especially given its popularity among the younger Generation Z, a demographic the company is eager to recapture.
Perhaps I’m being too optimistic too soon, but on social media, even a brief triumph of authenticity is worth noting. TikTok’s unprecedented success and continued growth is a pleasant surprise.

USC Composition and Theory and Analysis lecturer Bill Biersach’s band SH[eye]N played at Schoenfeld Symphonic Hall on Sunday night. SH[eye]N is a duo composed of Biersach, who plays the Chapman Railboard Stick, a ten-string metal instrument that allows for specific control of pitch, intonation and tone, and electronic percussionist Ralph Loynachan, who accompanies on the Electronic Batterie, an instrument that uses over 50 sampled and synthesized percussion sounds to create harmonic and atonal tunes alike. The band performed “Fractures,” an hour-and-a-half-long opus with the intention of inviting the audience to “think of the music as underscore to the movies they create in their own imaginations,” according to the program.
Though there were only two instruments on stage, they produced a wide assortment of sounds, ranging from percussion and piano to synth and guitar. The sound SH[eye]N created goes beyond electronic. The duo used many samples of classical percussion, and the Chapman Railboard Stick brought an innovative string section to expand on the electronic music genre and create something entirely new. 
Their music is not the only thing innovative about this band. Biersach and Loynachan met completely by chance, waiting in line for a lecture on The Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album, where Loynachan’s self-description as a third-generation percussionist intrigued Beirsach. 
“I never heard a drummer say anything like that, so we became friends instantly and we’ve been working since 2014,” Biersach said. 
Biersach was not the only one who saw an immediate partnership. Loynachan also identified with Biersach’s musical style and saw an opportunity for them to combine their strengths to create something special. 
“He said, ‘Have you ever heard of the Chapman Stick?’” Loynachan said. “I said I hadn’t per se, but I ventured up to his studio at Rock Haven. I was quite smitten over his embrace of improvisation and the organics.” 
The musical evening was not only a performance but also a whimsical experience overall. Entering the concert venue, the performance began with a black-light-face-painting station, where concertgoers painted glow-in-the-dark designs on their faces and bodies. The playful ambiance carried into the performance room itself, with laser projections swirling overhead creating a psychedelic atmosphere, preparing listeners for the avant-garde music. 
A hexagonal speaker system strategically placed around the audience provided a 360-degree sound experience that fully immersed listeners. After the opening number, the fluorescent lights turned off and were replaced by a black light, illuminating the LED strips on the instruments and the paint on everyone’s faces.
Both the musicians and the instruments of SH[eye]N bring an immense amount of creativity and originality into the band’s compositions and performances. The band has a core value of improvisation that allows the music to flow naturally to new places of discovery. 
“It keeps things really, really fresh because … we’re kind of playing on a razor’s edge in many respects,” Loynachan said. “There was a joie de vivre, a certain danger and element of surprise and discovery.”  
The element of danger Loynachan referred to came into play in the evening show, when, unbeknownst to audiences, a part of the Electronic Batterie stopped working. 
“Since it is electronic, one of the elements actually, it failed on me,” Loynachan said. “So what I did is I had to go to plan B and try to keep things going but that’s part of the whole rich, that kind of dangerous aspect of it all.”
Held on campus, the show presented a unique opportunity for Biersach’s students to observe the application of all the music knowledge he teaches them. Charlie McCollum, a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, took Biersach’s freshman seminar “Musical Subcultures of the Sixties” and attended the concert. 
“It was super cool to see a professor that I had in a completely new light and also listen to some music that I probably never would have been exposed to if he wasn’t my professor,” McCollum said. “It was interesting to see a professor do what he’s passionate about, and it was a very enjoyable experience because it was unlike anything I’ve really witnessed before.”
At the heart of SH[eye]N is the relationship between the two frontmen and their love of exploring sound. On stage, they work in harmony, even when the music is atonal. 
“Being in communion with Bill in this very non-verbal, ever-expansive way really forges this really fresh path,” Loynachan said. “We’re hoping to take the audience on this fanciful journey where you might sense that there’s a palpable sense of trust and vulnerability.”
SH[eye]N’s “Opus 7: Psychiatica!!” and “Opus 17: Towers of Need (Balancing Presently) the Album” are available for streaming on Spotify. “Opus 1: Gnawing the Straps” is available on their website.
