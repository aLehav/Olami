Rosalind Conerly was the first in her family to attend and graduate from college. Now, as the director of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, she said she uses what she learned as a first-generation student to help students at USC.
“Having to navigate school and figure out resources, having to work with my family to teach them about FAFSA and residence halls, [was something] I had to learn as I went [through] my undergraduate years,” Conerly said. 
She attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. She said her experiences there prepared for a career in student affairs. Recently, she completed her Doctorate at USC.
As director of the CBCSA, Conerly is able to work closely with Black students at the University, who make up less than 10 percent of the school population. 
“I’m able to listen to conversations that [students] are having, whether it’s music or TV shows or even deeper conversations about the political climate,” Conerly said. “I get a lot of students that just stop by to check in or tell me how their day is going.”
Conerly began her career at the Office of Institutional Inclusion at Arizona State University, where she coordinated diversity programs for both faculty and students. Through her work, she found a new and more personal experience once she joined the staff of the CBCSA. 
“[USC] was a great opportunity for me to get the hands-on, one-on-one experience with Black students as well as with the larger campus,” Conerly said. 
As a recent graduate and staff member at the CBCSA, David Elliott IV is one student who has witnessed Conerly’s compassion and hard work.
“Not only does she worry about administrative matters but the students themselves. They can come to her with anything, with problems or just to say hello,” said Elliott, who serves as the  CBCSA’s outreach and recruitment specialist. “I myself can go into her office and just rant and talk about anything — she makes time for that.” 
Every year, the CBCSA hosts events that aim to celebrate black culture and create a welcoming, supportive space for students and staff of African descent.
This year, Conerly said that the African American Culture Ceremony, which celebrated black students who were members of the USC class of 2017, was an important moment for her first year as the director of the CBCSA. 
“It was major for me, because I finished my doctorate [at USC’s Rossier School of Education] as well, and it was the first time I got to see an entire class graduate from freshman to senior year,” Conerly said.  
As Conerly watches the students she works with day to day move forward in their careers, and the conversations at the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs that she cites as meaningful to her position expand into the bigger world.

“We get to see them develop over the four or five-plus years they’ve been here, and it’s great to see them help us celebrate in our own way,” Conerly said.

In the fall, students will return to several capital construction projects, which are scheduled for completion. These include the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, MyFigueroa Project, a 24-hour Starbucks which will replace Café 84 and the USC Village. 
The Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience is a $50 million project funded by retired orthopedic surgeon and philanthropist Gary Michelson and his wife Alya Michelson. It will span 190,000 square feet on Childs Way, making it the largest building on campus after its completion in December. 
The building will contain shared labs, a nanofabrication facility and a suite of microscopy imaging for 30 principal investigators and hundreds of researchers and students.
“[The Michelson Center] is a University-wide umbrella for all at USC who want to leverage scientific collaboration to improve human health,” ,” wrote Steve Kay, provost professor of neurology, biomedical engineering and biological sciences, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “[It] will welcome undergraduates and graduate students alike from all disciplines to participate in discovery and invention.” 
Kay will lead the center beginning this Fall.
The center aims to make advances in the medical field by innovating biomedical devices, discovering drugs, and inventing new materials, among other innovations.
“Someone will emerge as the biotech capital of the world,” Gary Michelson said in a promotional video for the project. “L.A. is one of those places that’s in a position to have this happen. At USC, [t]here is an opportunity to actually have our answer.”
Along with the Michelson Center, Figueroa Street is currently undergoing a streetwide construction effort that aims to transform Figueroa Street, from downtown L.A. to Exposition Park, into a multimodal pathway that more safely and conveniently accommodates pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders and drivers. 
The Los Angeles Department of Transportation, which is in charge of locally managing the project, hopes to decrease injury crashes between motor vehicles and cyclists by turning a portion of the three-mile roadway into a protected bikeway. 
They also hope to make the experience of pedestrian and transit riders more enjoyable by adding better signalization, higher visibility crosswalks, transit platforms, foliage and public art. The MyFigueroa Project will be completed this June. 
In addition, Bridge Hall will undergo a $15 million renovation. It will be funded by trustee Thomas Barrack Jr., and will be renamed Barrack Hall. 
The project aims to accommodate the USC Marshall School of Business’ 15 international programs by creating new research centers, classrooms, offices and communal areas.
“The Barrack family’s exceptionally generous gift will bolster our Marshall School of Business and its faculty and students, and revitalize one of the school’s key facilities for generations to come,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias in a previous statement to USC News. 
Correction: The Michelson building is not a “$50 million project” – rather, the donation from Dr. and Mrs. Michelson was $50 million, but that is considered the ‘lead’ gift not the full construction cost. Typically, lead gifts like this account for 1/3 to 1/2 of a building’s construction, though I don’t know what the actual total cost is estimated at for the Michelson building.
the bio medical building was originally said to be completed in September. There is a three month delay now?

Everyday he wakes up with a burning desire to help Latinx students at USC. As the director of El Centro Chicano, Billy Vela leads the cultural center for Latinx students. Like many Latinx students at USC, Vela went through many hardships growing up. Vela was born in 1972 to Guatemalan immigrant parents and grew up in Highland Park.
“We were on welfare but [my mother] was working like a mad woman,” Vela said. “At that time just because you were on welfare did not mean you were coasting.” 
Despite the challenges he faced, Vela graduated from Franklin High School and went on to attend Occidental College where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. Vela said he has always been an advocate for Central Americans. At Occidental College, Vela co-founded the Central American Student Association.
He then attended Columbia University, Teacher’s College and received his master’s degree in Student Personnel Administration with an emphasis in Multiculturalism.
After graduating from Columbia, Vela worked as a resident director at UC Berkeley and as the director of Chicano Latino Student Services at Loyola Marymount University. 
Vela joined USC as director of El Centro Chicano in 2005, recruited by Corliss Bennett-McBride, former director of  the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. Since then Vela has used his experiences to encourage and support students facing the struggles he faced as a first-generation Latinx student.
“As leaders of this center, I am glad we are here to advocate,” Vela said. “To make sure El Centro feels welcoming and has murals and images that make people feel included.” 
Along with providing a place for Latinx students to visit and do work, El Centro Chicano also hosts the “El Sol y la Luna” Latino Floor in Fluor Tower. Created in 1974-75, the Latino Floor residential program is an opportunity offered to first-year students looking to connect with other students with similar interests and cultural backgrounds. 
Angeles Medina is one of the many students who found home as one of the residents of The Latino Floor. Now a rising sophomore, she said she feels fortunate to have worked with Vela.
“Billy is the kind of person who makes you feel comfortable, but he pushes your thinking,” Medina said. “He’s woke. He is very progressive and inclusive. He stays informed politically and encourages students he encounters to do so as well.” 
Alberto Bravo, a sophomore majoring in history, is a special projects assistant at El Centro. He works closely with Vela and also was a resident on the Latino Floor.
“I think Billy is the kind of Latinx who is proud of his culture, but he [also] acknowledges outdated views and adversity our community face,” Bravo said. “And he wants to push his community out of that mentality and way of living.”
Along with aiding Latinx students at USC, Vela said he finds much of his inspiration from his mother and his family. He said that, like him, many Latinx students try to succeed because of their family.
“There’s not a student without family,” Vela said. “There’s not a student without mom, without dad, without your tia or your tio or your abuelita. Whoever it was. People are people, but Latinos — we’re family based. It’s so important to us.” 
As for the future, Vela hopes to obtain his Ph.D and continue to advocate for diversity and inclusion. Vela states that one of his greatest accomplishments is finding his path and passion for education. 
“[One of my greatest accomplishments] has been finding my identity. Finding my history. Becoming a whole person because that was a big thing that was missing and I think it’s missing for a lot of us,” Vela said. “At the same time while that’s happening finding out a way to help others because that’s what my mom taught me.”

Artist Enrique Martínez Celaya will become the first Provost Professor of Humanities and Arts and will join the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Roski School of Art and Design faculty this fall.
“We are honored to welcome Enrique Martínez Celaya to our faculty,” USC Provost Michael Quick told USC News. “He is an exceptional contemporary artist with an engaging and creative mind. He will be an exciting addition to our university community.”
Before coming to USC, Martínez Celaya worked at Dartmouth College serving as the Roth Family Distinguished Visiting Scholar. 
Martínez Celaya was born in Cuba, but raised in both Spain and Puerto Rico. He began working as a painter at age 12, before studying applied and engineering physics at Cornell University. He received his master’s degree in quantum electronics at UC Berkeley. He also earned a master of fine arts at UC Santa Barbara.
Martínez Celaya’s work has been displayed all over the world including the State Hermitage Museum in Russia, the Museum der bildenden Künste in Germany and the Pérez Art Museum in Miami. He said much of his artwork is influenced by both philosophy and literature.
“My artistic practice incorporates literature, philosophy and science as well as art theory and history,” he told USC News. “In the past, I have worked with scientists, novelists, poets and philosophers, and I hope to continue and expand these collaborations at USC.”

Redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron has withdrawn from the NBA Draft and will return to USC for the 2017-18 season.
Head coach Andy Enfield confirmed Aaron’s decision on Wednesday — the last day for underclassmen to withdraw from this year’s draft — as the Seattle native will remain in Los Angeles for his second season in Cardinal and Gold. Aaron transferred to USC from Louisville in 2015, sitting out the subsequent season, and he turned heads with an impressive debut campaign in 2017, including a 23-point effort off the bench against UCLA to lead the Trojans to an upset in January.
His breakout against the Bruins earned Aaron Pac-12 Player of the Week honors, but he struggled as the season wore on, failing to tally a point in any of USC’s NCAA Tournament games.
Aaron surprised many by becoming the first member of Enfield’s squad to declare for the NBA Draft in March. Junior forward Bennie Boatwright and senior guard Elijah Stewart followed suit, but all three ultimately decided to return to the Galen Center for at least one more year. Aaron, Boatwright and Stewart all declared without an agent, signaling that they would likely come back to school, but the official announcement will come as a relief to many Trojan fans nonetheless.
With the trio’s return, the team now finds itself in a pleasantly unfamiliar position. Just four seasons after Enfield took over a floundering USC program in 2013, many experts have projected the Trojans as a preseason top-15 team, which would mark the first time since 1978 that the squad has achieved this feat.
USC graduated a single scholarship player this year, redshirt senior forward Charles Buggs, meaning the Trojans will retain the core that guided them agonizingly close to a Sweet 16 berth in last season’s NCAA Tournament. Junior forward Chimezie Metu, considered an NBA prospect if he had entered the draft this year, will be back, as well as senior guard Jordan McLaughlin. McLaughlin actually graduated USC this spring, earning his bachelor’s degree in three years, but he still holds one more year of NCAA eligibility.
Last season’s impressive freshman corps will also look to take another step forward in 2017. Guards De’Anthony Melton and Jonah Mathews carved out important roles during their first seasons at USC, and forward Nick Rakocevic had a coming-out party on the national stage during the Trojans’ First Four contest, as he sparked the team’s double-digit comeback against Providence to push USC into March Madness.
Enfield also brings a highly touted incoming recruiting class into the fold, highlighted by forward Charles O’Bannon Jr. — who turned down offers from Pac-12 rivals Arizona and UCLA as well as national powerhouse Kansas to sign for USC. Fellow ESPN-100 forward Jordan Usher will join O’Bannon Jr. as a freshman this fall, and 6-foot-11 center Victor Uyaelunmo rounds out Enfield’s 2017 class.
Enfield earned a contract extension through 2023 for his efforts in rebuilding the Trojan program, and he will look to take the squad to even greater heights next season.

USC baseball fought hard this weekend in the team’s final three games of the season, but in the end the Trojans came home with its eighth straight Pac-12 series defeat, finishing the year with a 21-34 record after dropping two of three against Washington. 
Entering this weekend’s games, the Trojans had not won a conference series since late March. Playing with nothing to lose appeared to suit them, however, as they looked loose and ready to battle in the first game in Seattle on Thursday. Opening the game with a lead-off home run from sophomore Lars Nootbaar, USC scored nine runs in the first two innings. Huskies starting pitcher Chris Micheles was yanked into the dugout before he could even record his first out. 
But despite the early offensive outburst, the Trojans were unable to sustain that offensive level, ultimately plating just one more run for the remainder of the game. Meanwhile, Washington also put on a hitting clinic early on, scoring six runs in the second inning. In the end, the Huskies bested USC 11-10 in a wild shootout. 
The Trojans continued their groove at the plate on Friday, totaling 15 hits and a season-high four home runs. Nootbaar turned in what was likely his best game of the season, as he went 4 for 5 with 3 RBI and a home run. He finished just a double shy of hitting for the cycle. 
Given the way Thursday’s and many other games this season have ended, USC’s lead didn’t exactly feel safe heading into the late innings. The Trojans were hopeful that their bullpen could preserve a much-needed victory, however, and sophomore pitchers CJ Stubbs and Solomon Bates provided just enough support from the mound to allow USC to tie the series with a 9-6 win. 
With each team trading blows and plenty of hits over the course of the series, the Trojans and Huskies prepared for a rubber game on Saturday that would double as the season finale for both teams. 
Unlike in the previous two contests, this time the Trojans struggled at the plate starting the game. They managed one run in the third inning off an RBI single from sophomore Brandon Perez, but the team then fell into a large deficit when Washington scored five runs across the fourth and fifth innings. 
Down 6-1 in the eighth inning, USC’s veterans tried to rally for one last win to cap the season. Senior Cris Perez ended the team’s scoring drought with an RBI single, and senior Corey Dempster crushed a double to center field that sent redshirt junior Frankie Rios home from second. Dempster then scored off of a throwing error. Suddenly, the Trojans were only down 6-4 with one more inning to play. 
However, USC was not able to continue its late-game rally. Washington plated an important insurance run off of a sacrifice bunt in the bottom of the eighth inning, extending its lead to three runs. In the top of the ninth, freshman Brady Shockey led off the inning with a single, but any hope for another high-scoring frame ended when Nootbaar grounded into a double play. 
After the loss to Washington, the Trojans finish the season last place in the Pac-12 (8-22 in conference play), a disappointing result for fifth-year head coach Dan Hubbs.

How do you give a contract extension to someone whose record was 137-143 ? Time for a change coach Dedeaux must be rolling over in his grave.

The USC women’s golf team’s search of a fourth national championship was halted on Wednesday, as the No. 10 nationally ranked Trojans fell to Northwestern in the NCAA semifinals at Rich Harvest Farms in Sugar Grove, Ill. Head coach Andrea Gaston and her squad finished third, tying with Stanford. Although this marked USC’s national-best 12th consecutive top-five finish, it also marked USC’s third straight semifinal exit.
After Tuesday’s session was cut short by rain and darkness, USC entered Wednesday holding a 4-1 lead midway through its semifinal match-play contest against the Wildcats. Going into Wednesday, freshman Muni He had a two-hole advantage through 13 holes, and sophomore Robynn Ree, senior’s Gabriella Then and Tiffany Chan were all nursing one-hole leads on the back nine.
Though He and Chan eventually converted their leads into wins, Northwestern came storming back, defeating Ree and redshirt senior, Victoria Morgan. After Then squandered a two-hole edge late on, the match came down to a decisive playoff between Then and the Wildcats’ Janet Mao.  Both players set themselves up with putts inside 10 feet on the first playoff hole, but Then left her effort an inch short of the cup after Mao sunk hers. Northwestern advanced to the finals.
Despite the disappointment, Gaston was upbeat about her team’s showing in Sugar Grove.
“I’m proud of this group,” the 21-year head coach said. “We went in with a lead today, but there’s a lot of talent on Northwestern’s team. They have some great players, and they got it done today.”
Finally, the Trojans reached their 20th straight championship round, after difficult weather at their NCAA Regionals in Albuquerque, N.M. Though USC’s fourth-place finish ended its run of seven consecutive regional victories, the squad’s determination in cold, blustery conditions secured yet another shot at a national championship. Morgan birdied three of her last four holes to card a team-leading 74 on the final day of play.
USC then advanced to the NCAA Championships, needing a top-eight finish to move on to the decisive match play tournament. Entering the final day, clinging to seventh place, the Trojans boosted themselves up to fifth, finishing 50-over 914 overall and securing a shot at their first national title since 2013.
In the opening round of match play, the No. 5 seeded Trojans topped No.4 seeded Ohio State 3-1-1. He suffered a blowout, five-hole loss, and Then finished all square after a 19-hole duel with the Buckeyes’ Jaclyn Lee. Ree and Chan both grabbed one-hole victories, while Morgan secured a four-hole win with three still left to play, setting up a semifinal date with Northwestern.
Gaston praised her team for a hard-fought season after the loss to the Wildcats.
“It’s been a week with lot of adversity here with the weather,” she said. “But our team was as prepared to face this challenge as we could be.”
USC now sets its sights on another strong campaign in the 2017-18 season. The Trojans will look to build on their success with many fresh faces, as the team graduates half of its roster at the end of this season.

The men’s golf team fell in the quarterfinals against Illinois on Tuesday.
The Trojans put up their best effort against a winning team, but would ultimately be defeated by the Illini, 3-1-1. Going into the quarterfinals, the originally top-seeded Trojans were tied with defending champion Oregon in fifth place. They were looking for their first national title after finishing as runners-up in 2015 and semi-finalists in 2016.
Though the Trojans didn’t achieve their goal, they secured themselves a place in USC history as they finished in the top eight for the third consecutive year, a feat they had not accomplished since 1977. USC is also one of only three teams that have reached match play in the last three years — the others being Illinois and Vanderbilt, who both advanced to the semifinals.
The Trojans were led by senior Rico Hoey, who was the last man standing against Illinois’ Nick Hardy. Hoey finished his last match as a Trojan at 3 over par, a tie for team best in Round 4 with junior Sean Crocker. They were followed by senior Andrew Levitt, freshman Cheng Jin and sophomore Justin Suh.
When the Trojans return in the fall, they will be without Hoey, Levitt, and Crocker, who has decided to go pro. However, the team will retain the eight remaining players including Jin and Suh, the two underclassmen who made it to the NCAA finals.

What happens to the Men when a major accomplishment is within their grasp? Won five tourneys during the regular season
then collapse in final round of regulation play, and continue the fall in first round of match play. Is it the pressure of trying to
win a national title for the very first time in this sport.  They join basketball of never winning a national title over all the  years
competing in the ncaa.

At only 19 years old, Atlanta-based artist Lil Yachty released his debut album Teenage Emotions on Friday following the release of two mixtapes and amid heavy backlash. His appearance, including his iconic Twizzler-red locks and goofy smile, mirror his musical style, which fuses upbeat pop with trap. The combination is not only distinct, but also has been widely criticized for hastening the demise of traditional rap. However, Yachty himself does not like being referred to as a rapper. 
“I’m not a rapper, I’m an artist,” he said in an interview with The New York Times. “And I’m more than an artist. I’m a brand.” 
While Lil Yachty isn’t an artist the same way that hip-hop greats like Nas or Biggie are, he is most certainly a brand: a brand of outcasts, and a brand of his own  — something rap has not seen much of before. 
For that reason, before listening to Teenage Emotions, check any preconceived notions of “what rap should be” at the door and instead buy into his showmanship. His unorthodox style rightfully offends pretentious hip-hop purists. After all, the lyricism is garbage and the rapping is off-beat. 
In “Peek a Boo” featuring Migos, Yachty raps, referencing a cello in his lyrics. He came out in an interview acknowledging that  he didn’t actually know what a cello was, mistaking it instead for a woodwind instrument. In fact, in the entire album of 21 songs, there isn’t a single bar that stands out as especially clever.
“DN Freestyle” and “XMen” are the most traditionally hip-hop; these are also two of the worst tracks on the album. Especially in “DN Freestyle,” Lil Yachty’s rapping under “hard” alter-ego Lil Boat sounds forced and awkward. It’s almost painful to hear him sing “Goddamn, Boat you hella wild / Turned your mother into a pedophile.” “Peek a Boo” still managed to capture attention as the only Boat song on the album that merits a listen, although rap group Migos carried through most of the song.
Instead, just like on the mixtape Lil Boat, it’s his pop-heavy songs that stand out. “Say My Name” and “Better” are guaranteed earworms that combine Lil Yachty’s classic auto-tuned vocals with catchy hooks and good-natured fun. They’re not going to go down in any history books, and hell, I would refrain from even calling them good. But they aren’t pretending to be something they’re not. Both songs showcase the best of Yachty’s bubblegum trap. “Priorities” and “Lady in Yellow” also seek to cement themselves as carefree party anthems, but both fall flat.
True to its name, Teenage Emotions hosts several angsty tracks as well. The album opener “Like a Star,” along with “Running With a Ghost” and “All You Had to Say” impressed mostly because they were better than expected. The songs don’t deserve a skip, but they also don’t offer anything that could not be better found elsewhere.
The album, like Lil Yachty himself, is fun, but lacks real nuance or depth. It would also benefit greatly by cutting some of the weak links from its long track list. Despite this, it symbolizes a massive movement within hip-hop that cannot be ignored.
Within the first week of its release, Teenage Emotions is projected to sell 60,000 albums. Love him or hate him, Lil Yachty is poised to remain relevant for years to come.

If you were driving through Westwood on Memorial Day it might have sounded like an afternoon in the streets of Kingston, Jamaica.
UCLA held its 31st annual JazzReggae Fest, a student-run event dedicated to showcasing artists who are making waves in their respective genres. In the past, performers such as Erykah Badu, Damian Marley and Common graced the stage in what has become a Memorial Day weekend tradition. 
The festival was well underway early in the afternoon, and the rear of the crowd was peppered with smiling faces lounging on their blankets, soaking up the sounds and the sunshine. For those who showed up early enough to catch the day’s opening acts, the bands did not disappoint. Third Degree opened its set with a cover of R&B singer Gallant’s hit single, “Weight in Gold,” as lead singer Ryan Nealon demonstrated his vocal range mimicking the towering falsetto. 
UCLA’s LatinJazz Big Band followed, filling the stage with saxophonists, horn players and various percussion makers. Bobby Rodriguez, the band’s director, added to the energy of the music with his own antics, keeping the mood light with corny jokes and impromptu dancing. 
The Mattson 2, a jazz-rock duo who has collaborated with accomplished artist Toro y Moi, launched into a 40-minute jam session during their set. The twin brothers showed great chemistry on stage, at one point sharing the lone drumset between the two without missing a beat. During the set, Jared Mattson took a break from laying down his airy guitar riffs to pay tribute to late jazz musician John Coltrane, playing an interlude from the pioneer’s catalogue.
Reggae culture was proudly featured the entire afternoon, from the stage to the crowd’s unique fashion. The DJ played the sounds of the islands between acts, embracing his time on the mic while keeping the vibe going. Jah9 was the first reggae artist to perform, immediately seizing the spotlight with her piercing vocals before diving into “New Name,” the title track from her 2013 album. The singer used her time as a platform to preach about domestic violence awareness and marijuana legalization in between songs. 
Though his afternoon set wasn’t the last of the day, Daniel Caesar felt like the true headliner of the music festival. The crowd grew larger as his performance came closer, and cheers erupted as he pulled up on a golf cart and snuck backstage. A few minutes later, he was greeted onstage with a thunderous applause. He opened his performance with “Violet” while strumming along on his guitar. 
Caesar’s genuine appreciation shined throughout the set. His meek, unassuming persona onstage belied his musical command, striking chords and hitting notes without fail before giving the crowd a sheepish smile as they showered him with praise. He ran through “Death & Taxes,” “Paradise” and “Show No Regret” from his debut album Pilgrim’s Paradise, and saluted fellow Toronto native River Tiber before playing their collaboration “West.” True to the theme of the day, Caesar even closed his breakout single “Get You” with a reggae remix. He beamed as the crowd sang along.
Eventually, Caesar’s time was up; as he left the stage, most of those in attendance left with him. The front section of the crowd was less than 10 rows deep for official headliner Protoje, who showed understandable frustration with the lack of interaction from the crowd. Still, his performance was gripping from the outset, with his band members doing an excellent job in the background. The band set the tone on their own for the first few songs, dropping imposing reggae beats before Protoje came out to “Resist No Evil,” emphatically singing “Lord I pray, please, never let me lose my way.” 
Protoje appeared defiant and strong throughout his set, proudly singing “I vow to protect my own” in his song “Protection,” the first from his 2014 album Ancient Future. He brought out fellow reggae singer Ky-Mani Marley to perform “Rasta Love,” and later reminded the audience of the importance of finding one’s happiness in the blessings they already have instead of chasing after it in things to come. Unhappy with the crowd but not unfazed, he went into “Blood Money” and “Hail Ras Tafari,” proclaiming his message with conviction before ending with “Who Knows.” 
The noticeable drop in fan interest could have been avoided by switching the order of the last two performers, but everyone who took the stage proved more than worthy. The JazzReggae Fest was an impressive afternoon of jazz and reggae music, and a great prelude to the impressive run of music festivals taking place this summer.

Most millennials’ positions on climate change and sustainability can be summed up in one sentence: It is real, and they believe in taking action to stop it. However, it seems that millennials often do not practice what they preach, even as it is becoming more crucial for this young generation to be the leading voice in environmental conservation.
A University of Texas energy poll revealed that 91 percent of millennials believe climate change is occurring, yet, this belief does not strongly translate into direct action. Although a high percentage of millennials claim to care about climate change on social media and in polls, a 40-year survey and analysis reported by the Washington Post found that this generation’s young Americans are less interested in conserving the environment than generations before them at their age. The study cites that 15 percent of millennials said they do not put effort into environmental conservation. For example, when it comes to reducing shower times or minimizing energy use, millennials were the least likely — compared to the baby boomers and Generation X — to make lifestyle changes.
 Furthermore, a study by the Glass Packaging Institute stated that while millennials are “more likely than any other age group to be concerned about serious environmental issues,” they are also “least likely to take actions that would support those beliefs  —the least likely to sort recyclables from trash and the least likely to take steps to save energy.” The study describes this age group as “high awareness, low action” particularly because there is a disconnect between personal responsibility and supporting environmental measures. Millennials must be at the forefront of the climate change and environmental movements, especially with resources like social media and the internet to bolster education and the spread of information.
 While this generation considers itself more aware, educated and proactive, studies conclude that most millennials still do not sacrifice comfort for action. There must be a fundamental shift in the way that individuals of all ages hold each other personally accountable, especially when it comes to the environment.
 An L.A. Times article announced that Californians reduced their water usage by 31 percent during July 2015, when Gov. Jerry Brown mandated that the state cut urban water usage by 25 percent. This action revealed the impact individuals are able to create with significant lifestyle changes that positively affect the environment, a learning lesson for a generation not focused on the impact of individual actions.
However, millennials should not wait for crises as dire as the drought to enact real change. These lifestyle changes, from watering lawns less to investing in sustainable solutions for individual homes, must always remain a priority.  With sea levels steadily rising and the rapid meltdown of glacier ice caps, millennials — the generation on track to be the most-educated, as well as the most connected  — carry the responsibility of encouraging environmental change. Otherwise, preventable crises like the drought will become commonplace.
 While individual responsibility must be increased and lifestyle changes instituted universally, real action must be implemented to hold environmentally harmful players accountable and encourage tangible change.  Social media, for one, is an incredibly effective tool. Social media shaming and online campaigns against irresponsible actions have created tangible change in the past and will continue to be an effective tool in the future.
 During the Deepwater Oil Spill, activists used social media to garner an enormous public reaction; there was outrage, alongside satirical remakes of footage of the spill. In 2016, Facebook became a powerful tool used for individuals across the nation to stand in solidarity with the protestors at Standing Rock, to object against the construction of an oil pipeline that would be environmentally damaging. Although it is rare that corporations who profit from environmental exploitation will change their practices, a strong public reaction that can potentially damage corporations’ reputations may help alter their future policies.
Additionally, college students must urge their own campuses to become more responsible and environmentally aware. Student environmental organizations have become increasingly popular on college campuses and have been able to shape the dialogue around sustainability. These organizations have the ability to shed light on individual practices, and therefore they should lobby for institutional changes, starting on their campus.  From energy-efficient appliances in dorms to responsible food selections -— more ambitiously — divesting from fossil fuels and energy-saving policies, universities such as USC have the resources to enact change. Students, and millennials overall, must proactively voice their opinions to make conservation a top priority.
Millennials are the generation that grew up hearing “Do something before it’s too late.” Yet, in the face of such a huge issue, they are still hesitant to take action. Under the Trump administration, sustainability is far from a priority. Millennials must shoulder this added burden and make the world aware that they will not back down from continuing the progress that has so painstakingly been made. Now is not the time to question the legitimacy of climate change or the legislation that has begun the long, difficult journey of restoring our planet. Now is the time to jump in headfirst and start walking the walk.

The possibility of a big earthquake is a lingering possibility in the minds of most Californians. There have been many 3.0 earthquakes in recent weeks around the Los Angeles area, in addition to more small quakes occurring daily in Southern California. 
Those who have grown up in the state have participated in earthquake drills throughout elementary, middle and high school to prepare for the day that a much bigger quake hits. According to seismologists, the foreshadowed “Big One” is overdue and will inflict heavy damage on California infrastructure, negatively affecting  the lives of its residents. 
Under President Trump’s recently proposed budget, the plan eliminates federal funding to further the development of an earthquake warning system in California, which would alert Californians of earthquakes within seconds or minutes of an earthquake. In the face of such natural disasters, with or without a warning system, USC must take strides to ensure maximum preparedness for its students and faculty through mandatory earthquake training and University-wide disaster evacuation and response plans.
Considering the great possibility of a large earthquake in the near future, USC students are dangerously unprepared. While those who have grown up in California may be familiar with earthquake safety procedures, many students who come from outside the Pacific Rim have never participated in any type of earthquake drill. 
According to the Administrative Operations page of USC’s website, the University participates in an annual Trojan ShakeOut Drill, which took place most recently on Oct. 20. However, many students were not aware that such a drill took place. Furthermore, while the event coincided with a statewide earthquake drill, it took place about two months after freshman students had moved in to USC in August. 
Even if every student had participated in the ShakeOut on Oct. 20, first-year students who came from a state or country where earthquakes do not occur had to live in Southern California for at least two months without any form of earthquake preparation. Students who entered USC in  Spring 2016 went 10 months without participating in a drill. In addition to an already low participation rate in the annual drill, students are still not being prepared for earthquakes upon their arrival at USC.
Under the current presidential administration, the prospect of developing a warning system is bleak. However, even a technologically advanced warning system would be ineffective without knowledge of earthquake safety and preparedness. 
Earthquake education and awareness are critical to help ensure students’ safety during a natural disaster. As a university in the heart of Southern California, USC must be responsible for preparing its students and faculty for the worst possible scenario. It is vital for the University to take action and act vigilantly. 
Regardless of Trump’s budget decisions, USC must make earthquake awareness a high priority for its students and faculty. Earthquake training should not come only in the form of an annual drill. In addition,  there should be training during orientation for new students and within respective residential colleges and university housing, supplemented by mandatory drills for all students and faculty at the beginning of each semester.
The 1994 Northridge earthquake was the most recent “Big One” to occur in Southern California. With a magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter scale, it claimed 57 lives, injured an upwards of 8,700 people and caused approximately $20 billion in damage.
According to the United States Geological Survey video, “Preparedness Now: The Great California ShakeOut,” in the event of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, there will be 1,800 deaths, 53,000 injuries and damages totaling $213 billion. The video also notes that the region south of the San Gabriel mountains, where USC is located, is overdue for a large earthquake by about 150 years. USC cannot afford to neglect earthquake awareness, because whether students are prepared for an earthquake or not, a big one is coming.
