For many, its been a long wait for the latest from Lady Gaga.
The Fame Monster dropped in November 2009, only weeks before the pop star embarked on her record-breaking Monster Ball tour. Weighing in at eight tracks, it was long for an EP but apparently too short to be taken seriously as a full-length album. Disregarding ambiguities over labels, there’s no question that The Fame Monster was heavy on the hits: Successful radio singles “Bad Romance,” “Alejandro” and “Telephone” were all taken from the shorter-than-average album.
With eighteen months of separation between releases, it’s only natural to assume the performer would have changed or evolved. What listeners will find on Born This Way is a Lady Gaga that hasn’t grown so much as been entirely reborn.
Fans got their first taste of the new album when the title track dropped in February, and the reaction was mixed at best. Heavy-handed lyrics bogged down what was sometimes panned as a complete rip-off of existing pop melodies (the song was so frequently compared to Madonna’s “Express Yourself” that Madge issued a statement of support for the self-affirming single). “Judas,” with its controversial religious motifs and similarities to “Bad Romance,” felt more like vintage Gaga, and “The Edge of Glory” and “Hair” were released without much fanfare on the Mondays leading up to the complete album release date.
Now that Born This Way is available in its entirety, it’s precisely the mixed bag the singles would have suggested. Stylistically, Lady Gaga is truly all over the place, lapsing occasionally into banda-style melodies on “Americano” and indulging in operatic preludes on “Government Hooker,” but the album can almost pass as cohesive in its complete lack of consistency. “Heavy Metal Lover” and “You and I” hardly seem as if they could come from the same album, let alone the same artist, but the unexpected pairing makes for an always engaging listening experience.
Lyrically, the album vacillates between nonsensical dance anthems (“Scheibe”) and message-driven pop (“Born This Way”), but fails to find a happy medium. Never before has the singer ventured so far into preachiness or ridiculousness, and the boldness does nothing to strengthen the album.
The one constant is Lady Gaga’s steadfast insistence on inclusion, with no fewer than three of the 14 songs on the standard edition being of the affirming “be true to yourself” ilk. As a public figure, the 25-year-old Stefani Germanotta has made a platform of fighting for equality for all, delivering impassioned sermons in front of the Capitol and even giving a keynote speech at an annual Human Rights Campaign dinner (President Barack Obama opened for her).
The music shines most brightly in songs where she doesn’t take herself as seriously. “Scheibe” and “Marry The Night” represent the danceable “Poker Face”-era Gaga that the world first fell in love with. She even speaks in fake German throughout the former.
The alternating dark and optimistic tones of the album offer an emotional roller coaster for listeners, but the experience is, if nothing else, unlike her previous work.
Born This Way will certainly garner more than a handful of negative reviews from critics who expect lighter pop, and is sure to satisfy the simple demand for new material from the singer’s “Little Monsters.” But if she hopes to hold onto old fans and gain new ones, a return to the more accessible stylings of The Fame couldn’t hurt.

What is a film franchise to do when what was originally supposed to be a supporting character completely hijacks the series? In the case of Pirates of the Caribbean, the answer was to ditch the intended leads and start another set of films showcasing the breakout character, here, Johnny Depp’s mercurial Captain Jack Sparrow.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the series’ fourth installment, puts Sparrow in the lead exclusively and seats Rob Marshall in the director’s chair previously occupied by Gore Verbinski.
Unsaddled of the story arc that bound the first three films together, On Stranger Tides finds Sparrow caught up in a three-way hunt among the Spanish, the British (led by Geoffrey Rush’s Captain Barbossa) and pirates under the command of the legendary Blackbeard (Ian McShane) for the Fountain of Youth. Along the way, he has to deal with impersonators, zombies — in the traditional voodoo sense, not so much the modern flesh eating kind — and an old flame, Angelica (Penélope Cruz).
It’s a good premise, lifted in large part from Tim Powers’ novel On Stranger Tides, but it gets lost in a muddled script. The main plot takes a long time to kick off, instead spending much of the first act in a seemingly endless set of chase scenes in London. In fact, that tends to be how much of the plot is handled. There are relatively few plot points, but the film dances around each one with lots of action, gags and belligerent sexual tension between Depp’s and Cruz’s characters.
In Tides, the first film centered solely on Jack Sparrow, Depp shows that he is still the master of the character. He manages to change moods and schemes at a drop of a hat, and Depp’s mastery of comically expressive faces gets even a greater chance to shine here than the previous three films. If there’s one fault with Sparrow, it’s that Marshall’s direction makes the film too much of a generic action film for the lead’s manipulative tendencies to really shine.
As the returning Barbossa, Rush is equally at ease in his role, and ends up offering quite a few laughs. McShane is the best part of the new cast, mixing serious threats with a bored disdain for Sparrow.
The weak link in the cast is Sam Claflin’s missionary Philip, or at least the way he’s handled. He plays almost no role in the first half of the film, before suddenly getting a lot of screen time for a weak romantic subplot, which feels a little forced thanks to its abruptness.
None of this is to say that the film is bad — it’s not. There are many entertaining parts (including a wonderful bit of dark humor) but the bloated and unfocused script, mixed with the rather generic directing style leaves it on the weaker end of the spectrum.
Perhaps one of the biggest disappointments lies in the visual look of the film. Although cinematographer Dariusz Wolski stayed on from the previous films, On Stranger Tides looks entirely different from its predecessors. Part of the fault lies with Marshall. Instead of Verbinski’s crisp vistas and touches of surrealism, Marshall focuses more on dark, cramped spaces and replaces the surreal with more comedy, some of which falls flat.
The film also suffers from joining the 3-D craze. Like so many other films trying to capitalize on the gimmick, On Stranger Tides uses very obvious shots designed for 3-D visuals that are clearly forced. It is a bit odd at first, but after the umpteenth shot of someone waving a sword directly at the camera, or swinging to the foreground, the novelty wears thin.
On Stranger Tides is ultimately a mixed success. With the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Disney was hoping to free it up from the continuity of the previous films and make it accessible to start a new spate of films.
Depp is one of the closest things to a sure bet in the film industry — charming and hilarious, he shows that Jack Sparrow can carry a movie on his own. The film also proves that there are many more premises for the franchise to follow.
Although the film suffers from poor storytelling (the fault for which can be chalked up to both the screenwriters and the director), the premise and cast are solid. In the end, On Stranger Tides has some very entertaining moments but cannot rise above the clutter it leaves in its wake at every plot turn.

It’s fairly common to hear someone say, “I wish I could have lived in the 1950s” or “I wonder what it was like to be a flapper in the 1920s.”  What’s not as common is the realization of that curiosity, something Woody Allen delightfully brings to the screen in his newest film, Midnight In Paris.
Crossroads · Gil (Wilson) is torn between a life spent pursuing his literary passions in Paris and chasing after paychecks in Hollywood. -  Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 
The end result is full of aesthetic intrigue, in which Allen subliminally urges viewers to drop everything and move to Paris, a place that seems to ooze with romance, beauty and spontaneity.
Allen also asks the question, “How often will we wish we lived in a different era?”
Filmed on location in the iconic French capital, Owen Wilson stars as Gil Pender, a successful screenwriter whose true passion lies in reading and writing novels. He and his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) are tourists from California.
Inez is oddly repugnant. In her most spiteful role since Mean Girls, McAdams plays a materialistic, stuck-up, Los Angeles stereotype. She wants to spend her time shopping for expensive French items to furnish her future Malibu beach house, while Wilson’s Gil wants to stroll the gorgeous Parisian streets and absorb the artistic culture.
She also discourages Gil from pursuing his first passion — literature. The real money is in Hollywood, not in books.
Wilson and McAdams (who also starred in Wedding Crashers together) represent a contrast of passions and possessions. For some, things like pearl earrings and extravagant five-course meals equal happiness. But for others like Gil, fulfillment comes through exploration of art and natural beauty.
Driven by nostalgic thoughts of past cultural booms — like the Jazz Age of the 1920s — Gil longs to stay in Paris forever.
One night while strolling the city alone under the moonlight, Gil’s time-traveling adventures begin when he agrees to take a ride in a stranger’s old-fashioned 1920s automobile. While it’s difficult to explain how, when midnight rolls around in the City of Lights, he ends up meeting an array of artistic icons. Frank and Zelda Fitzgerald booze it up with him, Ernest Hemingway challenges him to a fistfight and Gertrude Stein helps edit his novel.
Casting directors Stéphane Foenkinos, Patricia Kerrigan DiCerto and Juliet Taylor made Allen’s directorial job easy by assembling an incredible group of actors, including Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody and Carla Bruni.
Corey Stoll (Law & Order: Los Angeles) is the biggest standout as the troubled Hemingway, whose obsession with violence, alcohol and writing is somehow endearing.
Underneath the beautiful city and all-star casting, though, lies Allen’s classic ability to write quick-witted dialogue while tapping into characters whose lives are at a crossroads. Gil’s realistic struggle to choose between the pursuit of personal happiness as opposed to his questionable obligation to Inez is a driving thematic force.
But unlike the bleak outlook Allen’s films conveyed in years past (Annie Hall, Scoop) this new film is surprisingly optimistic. It’s a journey of self-discovery; for Allen, it’s also surprisingly cliche.
But it works.
And after seeing Allen’s Midnight, audiences may just wish they could spend all their midnights in Paris.

Forget the average dinner and movie date — with summer comes a new set of dating opportunities.  Use the relaxed summer vibe to your advantage and woo your sweetheart on these romantic summer outings.
Tea party at the Getty Central Garden
Walk through Robert Irwin’s intricately decorated archways and admire the abundance of roses in this Southern California treasure. When the sun starts to set, have a romantic tea party á la Alice and Wonderland, cuddle up with your date and take in the intermixing of luscious flowers and a vibrant pink and orange sunset over the Pacific Ocean.
Get your adrenaline pumping on a surfing date
Who wants to go out with someone who is just going to tan and listen to their iPod? Move beyond your average low-energy beach date and try out surfing for a change.  As if the adrenaline rush weren’t enough, experiencing something new and exciting together will connect you two on a deeper level and make you stand apart from the standard moonlit-walk-on-the-beach types.
Design by Natalie Chau | Summer Trojan
Scavenge for unique vintage finds at flea markets
The Fairfax and Rose Bowl flea markets both feature a motley assortment of clothes, art and jewelry.  Try on things you would never wear in any other circumstance, look through old photographs and posters, and create an original experience by revisiting the past — it’s a lot more interesting than your average Sunday brunch.
Snuggle up to some classics at an outdoor movie
Immerse yourself in the beauty of classic films at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.  The unusual movie spot has featured the likes of Casablanca and, most recently, The Shining. Mix it up with this change of scenery and outdoor setting as you watch some of Hollywood’s finest and snuggle under the stars.
Picnic at the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overview
For the active couple, hike up to this new and improved overlook of beautiful Los Angeles, featuring views from the beach to Downtown, to keep things interesting and adventurous.  Afterwards enjoy a romantic picnic as you take in an all-inclusive view of everything our stunning city has to offer.
Rock out at an outdoor concert
Check out Hard Summer, because nothing says romance like the electronic Boys Noize (note the sarcasm), and the Santa Monica Pier Twilight Dance Series.  And besides, every couple has to have their song — one option is “Kill Everybody” by Skrillex, one of the artists performing at Hard — so why not find yours together at a live show?  But seriously, music has a way of connecting people without words and these concerts provide the perfect opportunity for your relationship to go deeper than the superficial level.
Have a very Venice experience
Go retro with some ’80s-era roller blades and check out the unique finds specific only to Venice like custom jewelry and henna.  And of course you have to look out for the most outrageous characters you can find — be sure to keep an eye out for the rollerblading guitar player.
Flowers, Olvera Street and Romance, Oh My!
Visit the Downtown flower mart and pick out a bouquet together — summery sunflowers are a good bet — then visit the nearby Olvera Street and indulge in a spicy Latino experience. Look past the assumptions of the center as a tourist trap and admire the traditional architecture, hand-carved artwork and authentic Mexican food to create something special and different with your date.
Immerse yourself in beach culture
Nothing says summer romance more than an epic beach adventure.  Take a boat to Catalina and admire the traveling pods of dolphins, soak in the relaxing and beachy vibes, interact with the friendly islanders and see our sea life for what it truly is: stunningly beautiful.  Share a moment with your date observing our calm oceans and luscious sunsets and have the ultimate beach experience all at once.

On Friday, a gourmet showroom named The Market opened its doors on the third-story Dining Deck of Santa Monica Place, the upscale open-air mall capping off the beach city’s Third Street Promenade. The Market, which has been designed to evoke a conventional farmer’s market, boasts more than 10 different boutique-style stores.
The new establishment houses an impressive array of artisan shops, boutiques and restaurants to please the palate of even the most discriminating gastronome.  The building itself could pass for a gray-walled warehouse if not for the colorful shop displays lining the concrete walkway; purple and white orchids peep from the open storefront of Magical Blooms, while Röckenwagner Bakery’s glass display case tantalizes customers with stacks of baked goods ranging from colossal lemon bars to dark brown pretzel rolls.
With 11 different gourmet vendors, including a high-end wine shop and an organic ice cream sandwich stand, The Market leaves little to be desired in regards to the sweet and savory.
A little chocolate boutique called L’Artisan du Chocolat has to be the standout offering in the airy marketplace, though. A sleek glass case fills the majority of the shop’s space, but what else do you need in the storefront of a chocolate shop? Customers walk by and are drawn in by the artistry of the petite truffles, the detail of the delicate dipped strawberries and the timeless appeal of a simple bar of chocolate. Though the sweets are a little pricey, the treats are well worth it. The French chocolatiers use the highest quality ingredients, extending to the more avant-garde inclusions of bacon and Korean garlic (seen in the Santa Monica store as well as the company’s Silverlake flagship location). Some truffles even display dainty designs of gold leaf on their surfaces.
Not every shop in The Market, however, is so delicate. The Norcino Salumeria Cheese Bar serves up hefty plates of cheese and cured meats, thinly sliced and placed into sushi-style arrangements. In its selection of high-quality salumi (cured meats), the establishment certainly lives up to the name Norcino, which means “the butcher” in Italian. Served on thick cutting-boards, the salumeria evokes a feeling of old-world sustenance in a fresh Santa Monica location.
Closer to the windowed doors of The Market, a central island with a cheery logo is the home of Beachy Cream: Malibu’s Natural Ice Cream. The small Southern California-based company, which began as a mobile cart, serves up chunky ice cream sandwiches in a variety of clever combinations. Though the cart roams through several of Malibu’s most popular areas and the company chiefly serves markets in Malibu and Venice, the Santa Monica stand is Beachy Cream’s first fixed location. The sandwiches themselves are inspired by a certain California flair — the “Strawberry Surfer Girl,” for instance, is a scoop of strawberry balsamic swirl ice cream on a sugar cookie. As an added bonus, Beachy Cream’s products are completely organic, appealing to the more health-conscious California beach crowds.
Eater LA initially broke the news of Santa Monica Place’s plans for an open-air market in December 2009. Now, a year and a half later, The Market opens its doors to Los Angeles’ gourmet connoisseurs, with the first 500 customers receiving swag bags. Though The Market stands in stark contrast with the majority of Los Angeles’ food court concepts, it will certainly make an impression on every visitor to the Dining Deck of Third Street Promenade.

USC prides itself in being a residential campus, offering many on-campus housing options to the student population. A significant amount of students, however, choose to find cheaper alternative housing off campus. This creates a problem as their needs become different from those living on campus.
Jovanna Tosello | Summer Trojan 
Currently, USC and businesses affiliated with USC offer services available for commuter students, but most of these services are dated or inefficient. Students urgently need USC’s advocacy to help improve these programs to be improved to better accommodate the unique challenges commuters face.
The faults in the services offered to USC commuter students can hinder their performance in school and create a feeling of disconnect from the rest of the Trojan Family. The reality is that many students often spend hours on the road. The time they spend commuting can be utilized researching and catching up on readings instead.
Also, they do not have the opportunity to experience the fun-filled events on campus because most are scheduled at night, and most of these transportation options run during the day.
Nia Nakama, a junior majoring in communication, tries not to leave campus too late because she spends an hour or more driving home four days a week.
“I am disappointed that I can’t participate in events that start late because I have to get home before it gets too dark,” Nia Nakama, a junior majoring in communication said.
Zimride, a privately owned business affiliated with USC, is one service commuter students can use. Students and staff create a commuter profile that includes their destination and time of departure and return. Users also have to specify whether they are offering a ride or in need of one.
The purpose of the program is idealistic and is difficult to work with. Zimride attracts many staff members, which is unfortunate for most students as staff members typically work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. This repels commuter students because their schedules tend to be shorter and have a later start.
Another drawback to this website is that many students are not active. To make Zimride more efficient, Zimride must work with USC to raise awareness among its students to inform and attract more website users, which might encourage Zimride to offer student-friendly hours.
Vanpool is another privately owned business at USC. With this program, students can sign up for a ride to campus according to their location. The fare ranges from $97 to $215 per month depending on destinations. Although the fees are considered reasonable, students do not have the option of choosing the time of departure and return, as they are determined according to destination. In fact, the schedule would accommodate staff better because the time of departure starts from the bright and early 4:20 a.m. and the time of return can be as late as 5:20 p.m.
USC should advocate for Vanpool to improve its services by offering additional time options. Students should be able to choose the time of departure and return that fit their class schedules.
The tram service offered to all Trojans for a ride to Union Station is an example of a successful program. The tram service is a well-established service on campus and is widely used among the students. It is available on weekdays and operates every 15 minutes to an hour depending on the time of the day. Thanks to this service, students are able to catch a train to commute back home or for a weekend getaway to San Diego.
USC can further enhance its services by offering a tram ride to Downtown Los Angeles beyond the tram to L.A. Live provided on Fridays and Saturdays. City buses that have stops in Downtown quickly become crowded as students and workers head home. A Downtown Los Angeles tram, even if it only operated during the busy hours of the morning and afternoon, would help students like Kathleen Angkosoro, a junior majoring in international relations who resides in Medici, an apartment complex in Downtown Los Angeles.
“Even though I live literally 10 minutes away from school, I still have to drive in the traffic every morning. It would be a great addition if USC adds a tram service to Downtown Los Angeles,” Angkosoro said.
Changes by USC, Zimride and Vanpool would better assist a wide range of commuters.
 
Sasha Shuhaimi is a junior majoring in international relations. 
Kathleen Angkosoro needs a bike. Or a pair of walking shoes to get her to Union Station. Living at the Medici and yet she drives to campus? Puh-lease. I can have no sympathy whatsoever for her traffic, gas prices, road conditions, etc etc. It is only about 4 miles away from campus by bike or 1 mile (20 minute walk) from Union Station.
And for the other student that was mentioned in this piece: what ever happened to students being poor? Living an hour or more away from the university you attend is EXPENSIVE. Get a roommate and live closer to campus. But but but… I I I can’t… Mom wants me to live at home. Share a room, sleep on a couch, and go home for the weekend?
Remember car drivers–you ARE traffic.
I guess in Lalaland, where you obviously reside, there is no crime.  Students in your neck of the woods are free to walk or bike miles away from campus without any fear of getting mugged, raped, or run over.  It must be nice.  Good for you!
Are you saying you are impervious to being carjacked? Or what about mugged or raped walking to your precious cage–er *cough* excuse me–car. I live in Los Angeles same as you buddy. And I ride my bike to and from USC regularly (when not riding, I am taking the bus).
The difference between me and you is I don’t live in a walled fortress that offers the illusion of safety. I want this city to be better but it sometimes seems this city doesn’t want to be better. Ugh.
You know the Medici is located right next to Union Station…. where there is USC trams….. to and from Union Station.
With plenty of transit routes to Downtown (including both the F DASH and the Silver Line) and the Expo Line due to come online in November, there is no need to implement a Downtown LA tram.
The vanpool thing won’t happen, because the vanpools are primarily for the staff and faculty and the fixed times are actually centered around avoiding traffic and people who have families. I ride a vanpool and although sometimes working within a 7:30-4:30 frame can be challenging, I recognize it as necessary. If you leave 30 minutes later, you will be stuck in traffic, it doesn’t matter if you’re in the carpool lane and the poor person who drives (not an outside contractor, but staff or faculty, who also needs to make the trip) has to be on the road for longer. If you want to make vanpools more accessible for the shorter distances around school, you have to find staff or faculty who also need to commute, because they will never let students drive the vanpools and without a driver, no van will be dispatched.

Last Saturday, CNN published an article titled “Why would-be engineers end up as English majors,” which  claimed the low number of undergraduates studying science, technology, engineering and math affects the United States’ ability to compete in the global market.
CNN cited a 2010 study by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute that found 36 percent of white, 21 percent of black and 22 percent of Latino students completed a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering or math within five years of beginning college. According to the article, to further the United States’ role as a leader in technology, educators must make it a priority to develop American scientists and engineers at a young age.
Sylvia Hurtado, director of the Higher Education Research Institute, believes the trend of students leaving science and math fields is a serious problem.
Luis Villanueva | Summer Trojan
“Many students want to be in science, but very talented people are choosing other fields,” she told CNN. “That shouldn’t be the case.”
Students, even those talented in science, should be free to choose other majors. Students could simply have a greater interest in one area than another. Instead of promoting an education in only science, technology, engineering or math, students’ role models should develop a students’ curiosity in science and non-science fields.
Rather than attempting to increase the number of doctors, biologists and engineers, educators should be encouraging students to pursue their passions.
Without a doubt, USC students have the talent to enter numerous and disparate disciplines. The university encourages students to study in unrelated fields through its Renaissance Scholars Program that honors students who graduate with either a major and minor or two majors in “widely separated fields of study.” As the USC undergraduate admission website states, “It is this breadth of study that produces well-rounded graduates who often rise to the top of their fields.”
If an engineering major finds himself also passionate about English literature, then, if he cannot major in both, he should at least minor in one, although this might not be easy for some because of the demanding workload.
Hurtado claims poor scientific literacy and science and math programs that aim to lower the amount of students are to blame for the low numbers of graduates in science, technology, engineering and math. This suggests students are either not smart enough to complete a bachelor’s degree in one of those fields or they can’t deal with the competition and choose an easier major.
That shouldn’t be the assumption. The rigorous workload associated with an engineering degree might serve as a wake-up call for the students who chose engineering because of job opportunities available after graduation, rather than a passion for the major. English majors tend not to study humanities because of the plentiful jobs they’ll encounter with their bachelor’s degree, but because of the delight they find in reading and writing.
In another CNN article, Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said “America should not retreat to a narrow, technical education in hopes that it will makes us tougher in global competition.”
Undergraduates should not feel obligated to study in a science- or math-related field. It will only lead to disgruntled students who will experience an unpleasant four years of college. The decision of which major to choose should be based on the student’s passions, not just talents.

Smart people pursue STEM-related academic paths. Most people will rationalize and talk about “some people are smart in different ways”…yeah, OK. Some people do the “my univerisity’s admit rate is a single digit” *cough* (Stanford losers), or “SC is in the ghetto; their football team cheats, and the London Times still recognizes…” *cough* (ucla losers with joke-for-a-major BAs). 
It is platitudinous for me to reiterate, but society repudiates this because most American youths are too scared to compete in STEM academic paths: HARD MAJORs a la engineering, premed, computer science = a lot more promise than BA degrees, especially in this bleak economy. 
btw Ms. De la Vergne, please “creatively” develop a cure for cancer; engineer a fuel that’ll enable internal combustion powered cars to travel 300 miles from a fume of fuel; develop a military weapon that can wipe out 9 million people 9,000 miles away with the left click of a mouse….
Ah, yes – the old hippie “just follow your passions” line. This belief may have made sense back in the 60’s when college cost a couple hundred dollars a semester and good middle class jobs were readily available even for those without a degree. But America has changed quite a bit since then.
Newsflash: Most liberal arts majors (communications, philosophy, sociology, gender studies, etc) are useless. They might be difficult. They might involve hard work. Unfortunately, they have very little practical application in 21st century society. You might find Philosophy to be a fascinating subject, but “Philosopher” stopped being an actual job title several hundred years ago. The purpose of college is to prepare you for a career in something. Despite all the childish new-agey platitudes you may hear from your professors, not all majors are created equal. The world needs more engineers and scientists. It does not need more liberal arts scholars. STEM majors possess real, practical skills and will tangibly contribute to society in ways that people with an expert knowledge of “American Studies” will not. 
I agree with you.  I’d take it step further:  Assuming that only STEM majors are equipped to work in the technology business is narrow thinking.  The technology industry needs more than tech expertise to drive it.  What about creativity?  Articulating qualitative requirements?  Being an inventive, creative tester?  How about creating training materials for new technology, or working well in teams made up of people from many cultures–as is common in the global economy today?  Do they teach that in science, tech, engineering and math?  Nope.  Students learn that sort of thing studying history, culture, literature, sociology, anthropology and foreign languages.
Yes. Passion is the Key. There are not enough STEM role models in the US Elementary-Middle-Secondary Schools. This “shapes” & “develops” Passion for STEM.
However I take issue w/ Ms. de la Vergne. About the lack of Creativity and the ability to do collaborative work. Has she ever looked at the Engineering Curricula? What about USC’s Core Requirements? Both attempt to “foster” a STEM graduate who is not a “Total Tech-Nerd.” Of course Interdisciplinary schooling needs “tweaking”, but keep in mind the following saying. “Jack of all Trades. Master of None.”

USC baseball’s season has been tumultuous to say the least. The team started 4-1, then lost eight straight.
The Trojans appeared to get back on track with a thrilling 2-0 win over then-No. 13 UCLA at Dodger Stadium. Then they lost five in a row and started Pac-10 play 2-4. Their season has been marred by multiple losses to teams such as UC Santa Barbara, Pacific and UC Riverside. Yet they have taken series from the likes of then-No. 11 Stanford, No. 6 Arizona State and then-No. 2 Oregon State .
The team appears to have found some stability in recent weeks, both on the field and off. After taking two of three from the No. 6 Sun Devils, Frank Cruz was named full-time coach by athletic director Pat Haden. His team responded last weekend by handing the No. 2 Beavers their first series loss of the season.
This weekend, the Trojans (22-29, 12-12) host Washington State in a three-game set at Dedeaux Field in what will be both teams’ final games in 2011. Both teams are under .500, and although the Cougars (24-26, 8-16) can finish no higher than seventh in the Pac-10, USC could finish as high as fourth. For a program that hasn’t finished in the top half of the conference since 2005, that would be a huge step forward.
For that to happen, however, the Trojans will need to win their sixth Pac-10 series this season, which would be the most since their last postseason appearance in 2005. Last year the team won just two series in conference play. This year, they have been favored in just two series — this being one of them.
The Cougars have just two Pac-10 series wins this season against rivals Oregon and Washington — USC also took its series against those schools. However, the Cougars won a pair of games against UC Santa Barbara, a team that swept the Trojans.
Washington State is led at the plate by first baseman Taylor Ard. The sophomore has played in all 50 of the Cougars games this season and was the Pac-10 Player of the Week after leading WSU to a series win against Oregon, going 12-for-24 at the plate with nine extra-base hits. Ard is slugging .546 on the season and currently leads the Pac-10 in home runs,  with eight, and RBIs with 50.
This series will likely be decided by pitching. The Trojans, as they have all season, will start three righties: junior Andrew Triggs on Friday, junior Austin Wood on Saturday and senior Logan Odom on Sunday. Wood and Odom are coming off dominant performances against the Beavers, while Triggs tossed a complete game against the Sun Devils.
The Cougars will kick off the series with Adam Conley on the hill. The lefty is projected to go in the first five rounds of the upcoming MLB draft, and leads Cougar starters with 102 innings pitched and a 3.35 ERA, fanning 82 hitters while walking just 24. Saturday starter Chad Arnold has struggled this season. The senior righty has posted a 6.75 ERA and has walked the same number of hitters as he has struck out. The season will close for the Trojans against righthander James Wise, who owns a 4-6 record and a 4.50 ERA.
Although it might seem as if neither of these teams have a lot to play for, that’s never the case. A sweep by the Trojans could put the Cougars last in the Pac-10. A sweep would also guarantee the Trojans a top-half finish. For a team picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10 at the start of the season, it’s hard to ask for much more.
What did they hire the interim coach?  Quit accepting everyone’s son and go after real talent….
Man do your research. How hard is it to look up the results of the schedule? First off the bat the team started 3 and 1 not 4 and 1. Second they did not lose twice to Riverside splitting the two game series each winning on the road. Lost twice to Long Beach St. and Irvine plus swept by Fullerton  in three game series.

Four of the country’s top prep volleyball players — Tyler Cundiff, Ben Lam, Robbie McKnight and Austin Rysyk — will join USC for the 2012 season, USC coach Bill Ferguson announced on May 19.
The new class features state and club champions, players selected to be part of the national team’s pipeline of talent and a multitude of individual accolades.
“We’re thrilled to have these players join our program,” Ferguson said. “They will contribute to our team immediately by adding talented depth and they will be a big part of the future of our program.”
These new recruits will be charged to be part of a reloading process that will have to replace the efforts of four seniors that made up the country’s top recruiting class in 2007.
This time, however, the expectations are geared toward continuing a growing legacy rather than starting a new one.
When Ferguson was hired in 2006, the Trojans were fighting through a four-year stretch where they placed 11th out of 12 teams in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Conference.
Upon hire, Ferguson was inexperienced as a coach. He had, however, fostered deeply rooted connections in the high school club volleyball scene as a coach of the Southern California Volleyball Club. His skills as a recruiter were polished as he was finely in tune with the prep scene.
“I knew how to recruit, put a team together and get things going,” Ferguson said. “I always said that if there were a school that could revive themselves, it would be USC.”
As a result of the young coach’s leadership, the Trojans have been to two NCAA Final Fours in the past three seasons. This season, the Trojans paraded through the season as the No. 1 team, ending the season in a close five-set match in the NCAA semifinal.
The Trojans were under the steady guide of four senior leaders this season — the four that made up Ferguson’s first recruiting class, ranked as the best in the country.
Through the most tense moments and through tedious lulls, outside hitter Tri Bourne, setter Riley McKibbin, opposite Murphy Troy and middle blocker Austin Zahn have set prime examples of work ethic and persistence that propelled the Trojans to a No. 1 ranking throughout the season.
The four were chosen to be engines for a top-down program overhaul. Where pre-Ferguson teams were plagued by academic shortcomings and trouble on the court, his first recruits were top-notch athletes as well as high-achieving students.
The maturity and leadership skills demonstrated by the four student-athletes laid the foundation for an improved brand of USC volleyball. In the last three years, the Trojans have been to the NCAA Final Four twice, while reaching the NCAA championship match once.
The four boast seven combined All-MPSF awards and five All-American awards. McKibbin and Troy have served as co-captains for three and two years, respectively. Troy and Zahn were four-year starters and Bourne and McKibbin were three-year starters.
Cundiff, Lam, McKnight and Rysyk will be integral parts of the effort to reload and regain national prominence.
The four will add depth — and possibly replace — three of the four positions vacated by the 2007 group. Rysyk will strengthen the outside hitter position that lost two of its top three to graduation. Similarly, Cundiff and Lam will provide depth to the middle blocker position that graduated two of its top three. McKnight will vie for the setter spot vacated by three-year starter McKibbin.
As the Trojans’ season came to a close in the NCAA semifinals, the fearsome recruiting class from four years ago left the floor, never to return. They took a bottom-feeder program and turned it into a national powerhouse. They finished the regular season with a No. 1 ranking the last two years and earned a trip to the national championship match the year before that.
These Trojans have yet to bring a national championship home to the Galen Center, Ferguson’s and his first recruits’ combined effort to lead USC volleyball back to dominance during their collective stay is laudable. By building a program of successful students and excellent athletes, their legacy will live on through the success of their understudies for seasons to come.

USC junior Steve Lim watched from the fairway as his second shot on the par-4 10th hole drifted right, eventually landing in the greenside bunker.
Clutch · Junior Steve Lim’s tie for second-place at the San Diego Regional led USC to its fifth consecutive NCAA final appearance. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
To make matters worse, his playing partners from Ohio State and UCLA had just stuck their approach shots in the center of the green.
Lim, however, promptly sunk his shot from the sand, birdying the hole and besting his competitors, who had to settle for two-putt pars.
“It didn’t go the way I wanted, but I ended up in the bunker, holed out, and it’s the best thing I could do,” Lim said.
The junior’s adventurous 10th hole provided a microcosm of what was an up-and-down, but ultimately, successful week for the No. 15  USC men’s golf team. Lim’s 7-under par week (68-71-70) led the Trojans at the survive-and-advance NCAA West Regional at the Farms Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
“It was mission accomplished,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “[Friday and Saturday] were a little shaky but overall we’re happy to dofwhat we needed to do which is get out of here with a spot in nationals.”
USC’s second place finish at 7-under-par guaranteed it a spot in the season’s final tournament, which will be played May 31 through June 5 in Stillwater, Okla. No. 4 UCLA (13-under-par), No. 25 San Diego (even par), No. 28  Ohio State (1-over) and No. 11 Texas (9-over) also qualified for the NCAA championship from the West Regional.
The Trojans got off to a blazing start Thursday, grabbing a nine-stroke lead after the first round at 10-under par.
Freshman Jeffery Kang made eight birdies on his way to an opening round 66, which was good for a two-shot lead. Kang, like the Trojans, cooled off considerably over the next two days though, shooting 76-76 and finishing in a tie for 17th.
“I had a really good start,” Kang said. “Unfortunately, I didn’t play well the rest of the week.”
Sophomore Martin Trainer continued his solid play coming off of his victory at the Pac-10 championships earlier this month. Trainer’s scores of 73-71-69 earned him a seventh place finish at 3-under-par for the tournament.
“I left a lot of shots out there,” Trainer said. “The course wasn’t too tough so I feel like I could have done better, but I’m just happy that we got through as a team.”
Fellow sophomore T.J. Vogel echoed Trainer’s excitement for the team but expressed frustration with his individual results. Vogel, a freshman All-American last season, shot 71-77-74 and finished in a tie for 39th.
“It’s been a struggle,” Vogel said of his sophomore season. “It’s extremely frustrating seeing where I was last year and seeing where I am now. My short game isn’t up to par, my ball striking, just everything is at a level lower than it was at last year, but I’m working hard to get it back to where it was.”
Sophomore Sam Smith shot 78-72-79 and placed 60th, a disappointing finish after his eighth place result at the Pac-10 championship.
Zambri said he had come into the week afraid that the Farms Golf Club course didn’t suit his team and that the abundant hazards could cause the Trojans problems.
“Just coming off our previous event, Pac-10’s, we didn’t hit a lot of fairways so I was a little bit fearful of this type of layout, which is the kind if you hit it sideways, you’re goning to make double and triple [bogeys],” Zambri said. “I’m really happy that we got through.”
The Trojans, however, made it clear their performance at the regional stage was only a means to a greater end.
“It’s all about winning national championships,” Trainer said about the team’s goal. “That’s what USC is about and that’s what we want to do as a team.”

For the second year in a row junior Daniel Nguyen clinched the NCAA championship for USC, as the No. 2 Trojans claimed their third consecutive title in a 4-3 win against undefeated No. 1 Virginia.
This was the second time USC had won three consecutive titles.
Finishing strong · In a thrilling back-and-forth third set, junior Daniel Nguyen clinched USC’s win over top-seeded and undefeated Virginia in the NCAA title match. The win gave the Trojans their third consecutive national championship. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
USC coach Peter Smith couldn’t have been more proud.
“One word: history. I mean how many teams have won three in a row,” Smith said. “These boys did it. … It’s a very proud day to be a Trojan.”
Disposing of its previous opponents handily, USC looked as if they might be unchallenged en route to yet another NCAA title.
Within the first hour, the Trojans had secured the doubles point and were in command on five of the six courts during the first set of the singles matches.
Freshman Emilio Gomez exerted his dominance on court five, blanking Justin Shane 6-0 in the first set and moving on to take a 5-3 edge in the second. Shane tried making a comeback in the second set, taking the ninth game of the set to deuce, but Gomez never wavered and was the first Trojan to secure a victory in singles play, giving USC a 2-0 lead in the match.
Junior Steve Johnson was challenged by Virgina’s Michael Shabaz on court one. Tied at six apiece, Johnson used his signature serve to take control of the tiebreak to propel himself to a 8-6 (7-2) win after a grueling back-and-forth first set.
“You’ve got to bring the fire on a day like today,” Johnson said.
Johnson had a 5-3 edge in the second set, in the close, scrappy deuce-filled duel against Shabaz. But Johnson never looked back, earning the Trojans another point, winning 8-6, 6-3 to give USC a commanding 3-0 lead.
But the Cavaliers refused to quit.
Ngyuen was blanked 0-6 in the second set against Singh, but he kept his cool.
“I was bummed, but just tried to stay focused and take it one point and a time and stay composed,” Nguyen said.
On court two, senior Jaak Poldma defeated Virginia’s Alex Domijan in the first set. The co-captain, however, would fall in the second set and the deciding third set 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 allowing Domijan to clinch the first point of the day for the Cavaliers.
After senior Peter Lucassen battled back to knot his score with Virginia’s Julen Uriguen at one set apiece, he eventually fell in the third set 2-6, 6-1, 3-6. This cut USC’s deficit to a single point at 3-2.
Freshman Ray Sarmiento also won his first set, beating Virginia’s Jarmere Jenkins 6-3.
The freshman, however, faltered in the second and third sets, allowing Jenkins to tie the score at three apiece, setting the stage for Nguyen.
“You can’t worry about losing in that situation,” Smith said. “You’ve got to go for it.”
Nguyen broke Singh’s serve to lead 4-2 in the third set after Singh double-faulted. Nguyen took it to four deuce points in the eighth game, when he fell 3-5.
Nguyen was on serve when he fell 15-40 to Singh. Nguyen brought it back to deuce, but he lost the game.
Singh was on serve when Nguyen went up 30-15, two points away from the national championship title. Singh prolonged USC’s win a bit longer, winning the second point to bring the score to 40-30.
In one last point of beautiful footwork and ball placement, Nguyen did it again, beating Singh to clinch yet another NCAA title.
“It’s definitely a dream come true. [In] last year’s [match] I didn’t realize I clinched, but this year I realized I was last match on. I literally just pushed myself mentally and physically,” said an emotional Nguyen.  “I believed in myself and my team.”

Binge drinking, or excessive drinking in one sitting, has proven detrimental to the short- and long-term health of college-aged individuals.
Now it seems the effects of binge drinking could stretch all the way into the classroom, after a Spanish study found college students who binged had more trouble performing simple word memory tests when sober than those who did not binge drink.
Researchers at the University of Santiago de Compostela, led by Maria Parada, provided 122 students — all between the ages of 18 and 20 years old — with trials that tested various types of memory.
Natalie Chau | Summer Trojan
Students were first tested in their ability to recall a simple list of words. They were also administered tests that measured the students’ ability to recall a story told to them. Finally, the students’ visual memories were tested by providing four images and asking participants to recall information from the pictures.
Roughly half of the 122 test subjects were self-identified binge drinkers while the remaining subjects self-identified as more casual drinkers.
The difference between the two groups was statistically significant, as those who self-identified as bingers under performed on all word-based tests when compared to their non-binge drinking counterparts.
“[The] results suggest that [binge drinking] subjects need more neural resources to perform the memory task and that they experience greater difficulty in inhibiting interference from the distractors [sic],” the study said.
The study, which will be published in August in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, could not draw a direct cause-and-effect relationship between binge drinking and memory loss. Researchers were able to draw a “clear association” between the two characteristics, however, a result they attributed to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex regions of the brain.
The hippocampus, which is involved in the formation of both short- and long-term memory, organizing and storage as well as learning, is especially susceptible to damage from drinking, the Galicia, Spain-area researchers stated in their report.
“This is an important topic and a multifaceted problem,” told Thomas Hicklin, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry and behavioral sciences to the Huffington Post. “There’s a lot of peer pressure when it comes to binge drinking, but students need to protect their brains.”
Parada and her team were unable to draw the direct link between binging and the lower performance on the memory tests, despite controlling for possible confounding variables — including differences in intellectual ability, cannabis use, age onset of drinking, family socioeconomic status, family history of alcoholism or psychopathology.
Parada and her team admitted that there could be variables that cause this association that the research did not account for, or that the two characteristics could be related in a slightly different way than what the study suggests. The published report calls for more long-term studies to expound upon the findings of this eye-opening trial.
Still, Parada and her team felt their work was an important first step in protecting students when it comes to their drinking habits.
“It [is] important to determine whether differences in performance between the binge drinkers and non-binge drinkers may have repercussions on academic performance,” the study said.
Don’t binge drink… binge smoke… =)
Toke On!

Long heralded as the “University of Summer Construction,” USC is once again living up to its name.
Fifty-one different construction projects, both on campus and in surrounding areas, have been scheduled for the summer, some of which began as early as May 16.
Improvement · Less than two weeks into the summer, construction around USC has gotten off to a quick start on 51 different projects. - George Chearswat | Summer Trojan 
All projects are slated for completion before the beginning of the fall semester, with the exception of a remodel and building addition to the University Club into early 2012, according to USC Facilities Management Services.
The majority of the projects are utility and maintenance upgrades, but 24 classify as capital construction development projects — those that involve extensive groundbreaking, remodeling or renovating. As of press time, all construction is progressing on schedule.
“The summer schedule is always tight and we often push the envelope on what can be squeezed into that time frame,” said Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management in an email. “Nevertheless, we treat the schedules for these projects as critical and expect to complete all of the projects on time.”
The largest single project on campus is the construction of the new John McKay Center next to Cromwell Field, said Back, followed by extensive underground utility replacement and paving on Childs Way. The two projects are also the most expensive.
Many of the large projects have been in the works for more than a year, according to Back. Despite the extensive preparations, some students still feel the need for greater transparency from FMS, which has released little information about the details of the various projects.
“I don’t really know what they’re doing,” said Anish Parekh, a junior majoring in kinesiology. “The only thing people really know is that there’s a lot of construction. Over on Watt [Way], no one knows what they’re doing there. It’s not hugely inconvenient, but I’d like to know what’s going on. It is my school.”
Though some students expressed frustration about the inconvenience the construction brings in getting to class, they agree summer is the best time for such undertakings.
“A lot of the roads are narrowed or blocked, you have to go through a lot of narrow passages while you’re on campus,” said Jeff Yamada, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. “I think it’s pretty [necessary] though … they don’t do as much construction during the school year, this is just unfortunate for the students taking summer school.”
The administration, meanwhile, is focused on making sure those inconveniences don’t carry on into the fall semester.
“Anything can happen on a construction project, and it’s still very early, but as of now [all utility projects] are on time,” said Linda Chapital, communications manager for FMS. “We’ll work hard to keep [those projects] on schedule, because the bottom line is, we have to get it done before school starts. It’s got to be done.”
FMS would not release the total cost of the construction.
