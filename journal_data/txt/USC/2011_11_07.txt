Barack Obama
Support for President Barack Obama seems weakened by the current economic crisis and national unemployment numbers, which are still above 9 percent. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, three-quarters of people believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction, but Obama still tops his GOP counterparts, leading former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by six points and former businessman Herman Cain by 15 points in the poll.
Obama has already raised $75 million in campaign funding and continues to reach out to younger voters. The Obama campaign recently launched a program called Greater Together, aimed specifically at mobilizing voters aged 18 to 29.
Newt Gingrich
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich recently passed Rick Perry to take the third-place position among GOP hopefuls. Gingrich has gained five points since October, when he was in fifth place, and now polls with 13 percent support.
Gingrich holds more than $1 million in debt, but his campaign doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Gingrich’s campaign has the highest social media presence of all the GOP candidates, according to the Associated Press.
Michele Bachmann
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, representing Minnesota’s sixth district, is the only woman running for the Republican nomination in 2012. She has strong support from Christian conservatives and Tea Party members.
Bachmann has raised about $4.1 million and spent about $6 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Though Bachmann led in the Ames Straw Poll in August, her numbers quickly fell when Rick Perry joined the race. Currently, she holds about 3 percent of the GOP’s support.
Rick Perry
Current governor of Texas Rick Perry announced he was vying for the republican nomination in August. Early in the race, Perry led the polls with support from 30 percent of GOP members, but his numbers have dropped significantly to about 10 percent, with a six-point drop within the last month, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.
Many analysts say Perry lacks a strong pitch for his candidacy, but he recently received support from former President Bill Clinton for his stance on immigration.
Herman Cain
Herman Cain, former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, the 10th largest pizza chain in the nation based on sales, and head of the National Restaurant Association, has rocketed to the top of most major polls. He currently holds support from 27 percent of likely Republican voters, thanks in part to his “9-9-9” tax plan, a plan that essentially gets rid of the current tax code and implements a 9 percent tax on business income, a 9 percent tax on personal income and a new 9 percent federal sales tax.
Cain has made headlines recently for allegations of sexual harassment. Cain’s campaign has denied the allegations, calling them “bogus attacks.”
Ron Paul
Many analysts believe that if Texas Congressman Ron Paul doesn’t win the Republican ticket for 2012, he might consider a third-party run as an Independent,  though Paul has said he has “no intention” of doing that. If he does, the loyalty of his followers could affect the outcome of the general election.
Paul has been reluctant to support any other Republican candidate and has only been able to raise $8.2 million in campaign funding.
Mitt Romney
Former governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney has stayed mostly out of the headlines, but he’s slowly but surely pulling ahead of his competition. In the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, 33 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents chose him as the candidate most likely to beat Obama one year from now.
Romney, who ran an unsuccessful campaign in the 2008 Republican primaries, has been campaigning in Iowa. While there, he said he would reduce spending if elected by repealing Obama’s healthcare law and eliminating programs that are not vital, such as the National Endowment for the Arts.
Ron Paul is the only candidate that is not raising debt, getting us into wars and taking away our freedoms.
Why would Paul support another candidate in the same race? Has any other candidate in the race supported someone else? What does his campaign money have to do with support for other candidates? Why didn’t either of you clarify that Paul’s $8.2 million was ONLY for the 3rd quarter? He has actually raised $13+ million total. Do the words, ‘objectivity in journalism’ mean anything to you? Do you consider your souls clean or dirty? Define honor…

They know him as a hero, a role model and a man of many bow ties, but Henri Ford’s students nominated him for a national award because of his dedication to teaching.

Ford, a professor of surgery and vice dean for Medical Education at the USC Keck School of Medicine, received the American Association of Medical Colleges Arnold P. Gold Foundation Humanism in Medicine Award on Saturday at the association’s annual meeting in Denver. The award is given to a medical school faculty member who mentors their students with care and compassion through teaching and advising.
John Mahajan, the student who submitted the proposal for Ford’s nomination, is USC’s primary representative for the Organization of Student Representatives, the AAMC body for undergraduate and graduate medical students. Mahajan said the award is a reflection of just how inspirational Ford is to everyone he comes in contact with, from his patients and peers to his students and international colleagues.
“Ford is the kind of doctor we all want to be,” Mahajan said. “He is a hero whom I look up to and professionally, he has done so much in his field internationally. Students love working with him, and this sets him apart. He is so humble and as a medical student, to be able to see someone who is so passionate about what he does in helping people, it is very inspiring.”
Ford, who also serves as vice president and chief of surgery at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said his biggest priority has never been his own achievements but the success of his students.
“I am not doing anything different now from what I’ve done all my life,” Ford said. “Teaching and mentoring is part of my constitutional makeup, part of my own fabric.”
Ford said enthusiasm is vital to teaching.
“The essence of working with students … is to hopefully convey an infectious excitement for the field of medicine and learning in general,” Ford said. “It is important for them to recognize what they do will impact lives of others and does make a difference.”
Ford said his philosophy has always been to practice what he preaches to inspire students to do good work. When an earthquake hit his home country of Haiti in 2010, Ford left to provide medical aid to those in need.
“Regardless of my position, when the  earthquake hit Haiti, I had something to offer,” Ford said. “I didn’t hesitate to drop everything and go. My service would be of the greatest help and have the biggest impact on lives of interest — children.”
Ford’s work in Haiti has particularly influenced his students.
“When the earthquake happened, I was able to interview him when he came back,” Majahan said. “Listening to him speak about what happened there, it changed me that day.”
Mahajan said Ford’s dedication moved him.
“Watching him, you could just see that he bears the burden of that country of his shoulders, and he is so involved in transforming the country, as he has gone back to Haiti many times,” Mahajan said. “The passion he had [makes it clear that] he really is trying to make a difference in people’s lives.”
Ford said the opportunity to teach is not one he takes lightly.
“As an educator, you are influencing the practice of medicine for years, decades to come,” Ford said. “It is a unique privilege.”
Ford said his receipt of the award shows his students took his messages to heart.
“The recognition of students says that the role modeling … is working,” Ford said. “More importantly, it tells me something about the medical students’ own values — that they recognize what is important — to see someone who is concerned about their education and wants to see them reach their full potential.”
He said his work outside the classroom corresponds with what he teaches to his students.
“At the end of day, you can talk all you want,” Ford said. “What they see in you and what they see you do is the most important lesson that will impact them for the rest of their lives.”

Jefferson Boulevard will be altered to provide a more pedestrian-friendly environment as part of the new Village at USC plan.
Bicycle · Plans show the university will add bike lanes on both sides of Jefferson Boulevard when The Village is constructed. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The existing parking lanes will be converted to pedestrian and bicycling lanes, but the current travel lanes will remain intact.
The change is intended to provide a pedestrian link between university facilities and reduce the flow of automobile traffic.
Brian League, executive director of university real estate development, said the bike lane proposal, which needs approval from the City of Los Angeles, is intended to provide a safer environment for the community and students.
“When we implement this new plan those bicyclists will have 6-foot dedicated bikes lanes on both lanes of Jefferson,” League said. “The bicycle lanes make much safer conditions for pedestrians and cyclists.”
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said the new pathways on Jefferson will help reduce traffic flow and create a more student-friendly environment.
“[Altering] a street or the number of lanes are effective techniques that engineers use to slow down traffic,” Carlisle said. “If [traffic flow on] Jefferson is [altered] then both the traffic and speed will be reduced, which will make it safer for all bicyclists and pedestrians.”
Adrienne Scotti, a senior majoring in psychology, said installing bike lanes could help prevent accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians.
“Jefferson could be safer for bikers,” Scotti said. “If bike lanes are added, it might force people to be more considerate of other bikers that also share the road.”
Tyler Hicks, an undeclared sophomore, said she does not see the point of making Jefferson more pedestrian friendly because it would cause more problems than it would solve.
“It is not a good idea to [alter] the street because a lot of traffic runs through Jefferson,” Hicks said. “It’s a major inconvenience for the people that live around Jefferson.”
Good to hear about these plans and that USC is planning ahead in order to avoid future accidents with the bikes when the new Village opens. We urgently need more bike lanes to improve the traffic in the neighborhood. As a commuter, I expect that the changes would benefit the drivers too. I hate driving during rush hour on Jefferson, Hoover and surrounding streets, because some (not all) bike riders are usually distracted and literally invade not only the bike lane but also the car lanes; there are so many that go on the same direction at the same time and they get in between cars and buses. I understand we all have to share the road, but I really hate seeing irresponsible bike riders (and some car drivers too) distracted texting, talking on the cellphone, listening to their music and riding on the opposite direction. At one point there were issuing tickets, but not anymore. I hope this plan also includes ticketing irresponsible people again when the Village opens, so everybody is more careful.

The USC chapter of CalPIRG said it wants to double its annual fundraising goal as it kicked off its pledge drive Monday to encourage long-term donations to support its professional staff.
USC CalPIRG, a student-run organization that focuses on public interest issues and assuring students’ voices are heard in state government, currently advocates for issues such as banning the use of plastic bags in California and abolishing subsidies on corn products. CalPIRG uses its funds to hire lobbyists to represent its stances in Sacramento.
The organization hopes to increase its donations to $75,000 by asking students to donate $10 monthly for as long as they can afford, said David Mittelstein, chair of USC CalPIRG. The group now only accepts credit card donations to facilitate long-term commitments.
“The problem with cash donations is that they are not ongoing so we would have to do these fundraisers every month,” Mittelstein said. “This frees us up to focus on our campaign work.”
Mittelstein said the organization wants to increase its annual fundraising so it can increase its visibility.
“We really need these donations so we can be self-sufficient and compete on par with other special interest groups in getting our petitions heard and implemented in society,” Mittelstein said. “In politics, money is power, so we hire professional advocates like lawyers and lobbyists who give us a voice in the government.”
CalPIRG’s current “Save the Oceans” campaign focuses on banning plastic bags in California. The campaign has received 4,700 signatures at USC this year.
James DuLac, a coordinator of the campaign, said USC’s chapter has room to grow.
“The USC chapter of CalPIRG is relatively young compared to other chapters in California, so we are growing rapidly every year,” DuLac said. “Its great that we are able to hire full time staff who go to Washington, D.C. and Sacramento to get our voices heard on issues.”

No. 23 USC started off the season with a 77-65 exhibition win over Westmont on Monday, finally pulling away at the end of the game after trading the lead back and forth with the Warriors.
Four players scored in double digits for the Women of Troy, who were led by 23 points from senior point guard Jacki Gemelos.
Senior guard Ashley Corral (17 points), senior guard Briana Gilbreath (14 points) and freshman guard Ariya Crook (10 points) also scored in double digits for USC.
Westmont hung tough with USC thanks in large part to forward Tugne Canitez, who scored over half the team’s points by recording 33 buckets.
The Warriors grabbed a 27-26 lead with 3:10 to go in the first half, but the Women of Troy ended the frame with a 13-4 run to take a 39-31 lead.
Westmont got within four points as late as the 6:24 mark in the second half, but USC went on a 10-2 run sparked by threes from Gemelos and Corral to take a 70-58 lead that wouldn’t get much closer as the game wound down to a close.
Canitez, who narrowly missed a double-double by recording nine rebounds, gave the Women of Troy trouble down low all night.
USC sent Canitez to the free throw line 13 times, and she took advantage by sinking 12 of those chances.
But the Women of Troy came out on top in the end, in large part to their superior performance from beyond the arc.
USC made 6-of-15 shots from three-point range, including a perfect 3-of-3 from Gemelos.
Forward Alexyz Vaioletama, the lone freshman starter for USC, held her own on the boards by securing a team-high nine rebounds while chipping in four points.
The Women of Troy’s first official game of the 2011-2012 season comes on Friday, when they face Fresno State at 5 p.m. at the Galen Center as part of a doubleheader with the men’s squad.

Bringing a beach vibe to this season’s chilly weather, The Miracals, formally known as The Smiles, released Give Me a Chance, its 2nd EP, on Nov. 7.
A few months ago, the three-piece band of USC students changed its name to The Miracals after a legal conflict with a local children’s dental office.
The name might have changed, but the group’s classic laid-back surf rock sound has not.
Comprising alumnus John McGrath on vocals and guitar, Will Sturgeon, a senior majoring in popular music on vocals and bass, and Mark Edwards, a senior in the music industry program playing the drums, the group says it’s influenced by The Beach Boys, and describes its music as “beach rock” or “tropical grunge.” For this particular EP, Mike Goldman, of the band Chasing Kings, joined in the recording.
Give Me a Chance seems perfect for summertime, but it might fill in the gap for listeners longing for warm weather to return.
“Oh I Know” starts off the 5-track EP with a quick drum intro and immediately falls into the distinct harmonies of vocalists John McGrath and Will Sturgeon. The song sounds like a heart-to-heart exchanged between two friends with lines such as “You give her anything, but she would only take” and “She’s no good for you after all.”
Those lyrics lead into the next song “Give Me a Chance,” a love song with vocals pleading for a girl’s affection. It is reminiscent of classic crooner tunes of the ’50s.
The rest of the EP sticks with a romantic theme and is appropriate for date nights or cruising around beach towns. The music is fairly simple but it is very solid with solid drum patterns and melodic guitar and bass lines.
Give Me a Chance is available on iTunes and for free on Bandcamp and Soundcloud.

Despite a rare Monday practice for No. 18 USC, the most pertinent story that emerged wasn’t even something that happened on the practice field. For the first time this season, an opponent has provided some highly-publicized bulletin-board material.

Following his team’s 34-17 loss to No. 7 Oregon on Saturday, Washington defensive coordinator Nick Holt was asked by reporters about the Huskies’ matchup with the Trojans this Saturday at the Coliseum.
“We’ll be OK against these guys,” Holt said. “I’d rather play against USC than Oregon quite honestly.”
Statistically, that makes enough sense. Oregon ranks seventh nationally in total offense; USC is 26th. The Ducks rack up 46 points-per-game — good for sixth nationally. USC is 32nd in the country, scoring at a 33.4 points per game clip.
“You could ask every defensive coordinator in our conference the same question and they’d tell you the same thing: Oregon is hard to prepare for because of how unique they are,” Washington coach Steve Sarkisian said. “That doesn’t mean ’SC is not very good. They’re a tremendous offensive football team and I think [Holt] would agree with that.”
Holt is a former USC linebackers coach and defensive coordinator who headed to Washington along with Sarkisian in 2009.
Holt’s quote was posted all around Heritage Hall on Monday, along with an added message that is slightly paraphrased: “I know how to stop them.”
At the bottom there’s an asterisk, making it known that “[By the way] — Washington gave up 484 (yards) including 298 rushing last (year) to USC.”
It is unknown who posted the sign, and USC, for now, isn’t speaking out on the issue.
“I don’t make much of it,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We have great respect for those guys and their staff and their players. They can say whatever they want. They beat us, two years in a row. So they can say whatever they want.”
For Kiffin, playing the Huskies could be construed as personal. He and Sarkisian were the top offensive assistants during former USC coach Pete Carroll’s tenure, and the two have maintained a close friendship since Kiffin’s departure to the NFL in 2007.
Kiffin, however, did not explicitly admit to a personal rivalry.
“This isn’t about Sarkisian or Kiffin. We want to beat Washington because they beat us,” Kiffin said. “We want to win every game that we play, especially when you feel like you had a game that we could have won. Like the Notre Dame game, you do have a sense from your players that you’d like to get those back because you felt you could have won them with so many opportunities and you have to wait a whole year to have a chance again.”
Sarkisian, by and large, echoed similar sentiments.
“It’s a healthy friendship and a healthy rivalry,” he said. “We’re both competitive guys who like to win not for us individually but for our teams, our kids and our coaches.”

Senior middle linebacker Chris Galippo will again not start against the Huskies on Saturday, his spot having been usurped by true freshman Lamar Dawson.
“[This is] just another something else that I kind of have to deal with in my career now,” Galippo said. “I’m not going to feel sorry for myself. I’m going to come out here every day and prove what type of linebacker I am.”
According to Kiffin and linebackers coach Joe Barry, Galippo was understandably upset when he was informed of his demotion to second-string.
“He wasn’t happy with it,” Barry said. “[But] I was happy [about that]. We’d have a big problem if he was OK with it. He struggled early on last week after we told him about it. But he came out and had a great practice on Wednesday and a great practice on Thursday and played well on Friday.”
Barry said the depth chart isn’t “set in stone,” but “written in dry-erase marker,” meaning it is subject to change at any time.
“Lamar is still the starter, Chris is still the backup,” Barry said. “They’re both going to play, they’re both going to rotate. We’re going to go week to week.”
—
Senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris did not practice Monday, junior safety Jawanza Starling and freshmen linebackers Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard “did not do much,” according to Kiffin.
Freshman receiver Marqise Lee and sophomore receiver Robert Woods were also limited, as was senior tailback Marc Tyler.
“The only good thing is we are a day ahead,” Kiffin said. “As we go throughout the week, hopefully they all will be back.”

In typical Trojan fashion, the USC men’s basketball team begins its season Friday against CSU Northridge with little to no fanfare.
You can thank the Trojans’ No. 18 football team for most of the distraction, as its 7-2 record and recent play have captured the attention of many more people than those residing between Adams and Exposition Boulevards.
The unexpected season-ending injury to star senior guard Jio Fontan earlier this year certainly doesn’t help either, as USC now stands without its key playmaker from last season.
Throw in the Trojans’ most recent first-round exit in the NCAA tournament and the departure of towering forwards Nikola Vucevic and Alex Stepheson, and it’s not hard to see why the Nov. 11 date isn’t circled on most Trojan fans’ calendars.
Though all of these factors have detracted from the build-up to USC’s upcoming season, the team still has a bit of an edge: its schedule.
After hosting the Matadors, the Trojans will kick off a non-conference schedule guaranteed to get them noticed, if for no other reason than because of the high-caliber teams they are set to face.
USC starts with Nebraska, which the Trojans narrowly lost 60-58 last season despite holding a 20-point lead late in the first half.
The Cornhuskers barely missed the NCAA tournament a season ago, but do return four of five starters for 2011 and will certainly make a splash in their first season as members of the Big Ten.
The Trojans then go on the road to begin one of their toughest non-conference stretches in recent memory, starting with reigning Mountain West champion and NCAA tournament two-seed San Diego State.
The Aztecs, who have only lost twice at home in the last two seasons, are fresh off a 34-3 season in which they were upset in the Sweet 16 by eventual national champion Connecticut.
After two home games to begin the Las Vegas Invitational, the Trojans will head to Las Vegas to face UNLV, who finished third in the Mountain West behind SDSU and BYU and also earned a NCAA tournament berth.
And if that weren’t enough, a potential matchup with perennial-powerhouse and preseason No. 1 North Carolina looms large the next day, assuming USC can win a couple of games.
And that’s just the first three weeks of the season.
USC will travel to Minnesota to face a Gopher team quickly rising to national relevance, before hosting Georgia, TCU and eventually No. 13 Kansas at the Galen Center to close out the nonconference portion of its schedule.
This certainly isn’t the best way to ease into a Pac-12 slate that features three top-25 teams in Arizona, California and UCLA, and a slew of others on the upswing, but a season chock-full of great matchups should not be a point of pessimism.
“I’m of the mindset [that] you have to play people to get better,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said after Wednesday’s practice. “You need to play games at a high level to get ready for conference play.”
At the college level, perception matters, and the Trojans will get more than their share of opportunities to prove themselves on a stage that otherwise wouldn’t be available without nationally relevant opponents.
If USC can manage to win a couple of these big nonconference games, much like it did last season with wins over Texas and Tennessee, the Trojans will make a strong case to potential recruits that Southern California is as much a place to succeed in basketball as it is football.
Similarly, with some success, the team can back up recent efforts to bring in more fans to its games and begin to properly utilize the Galen Center as a loud arena that truly offers home-court advantage.
It might seem backward, but with the team already at a disadvantage because of injuries, this season is the perfect time to take some risks and look to shake up the landscape of college basketball, especially on the West Coast.
The Trojans have stayed relatively quiet since they were hit with self-imposed sanctions for the 2009-2010 season — Kevin O’Neill’s first with the program, but continuing to fly under the radar won’t help the Trojans bring in the future talent they need to succeed in the long run; proving they have some degree of staying ability, however, will.
Rather than sink back into obscurity, the Trojans are much better served by challenging top teams across the country.
After all, why shouldn’t they?
In the long run, and just maybe in the immediate future, it should help the team progress.
With seemingly everyone expecting a major falloff from the Trojans, there’s no better time to risk it all.

An aggressive drive to the basket by senior guard Jio Fontan during an exhibition game in a crowded Brazilian gym was all it took to shift the guard position from a strength to an inexperienced liability for the USC men’s basketball team this season.
Lone holdover · Sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who averaged 9.9 points, 3.2 assists and two steals per game last season, is the only returning USC player with starting experience. - Daily Trojan file photo
Fontan suffered an ACL tear that could sideline him the entire 2011-2012 season, forcing the Trojans to scramble to replace Fontan — their captain, as well as their leading returner in points and assists.
“We are running a totally different offense than we did going into Brazil with Fontan,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We retooled everything offensively once we knew he was not coming back.”
Sophomore guard Maurice Jones will fill in as captain and start at point guard after playing shooting guard alongside Fontan for much of last season.
“I can score from the point,” Jones said. “It is easier to score off the ball, but I like having the ball in my hands. [O’Neill] told me to be more aggressive, but to still keep that point guard mentality in mind.”
Last season, Jones proved he could score at the collegiate level — albeit inconsistently. In his first three games, he averaged 18.3 points per game, including a 29-point outburst against Santa Clara in just his second college game. In contrast, in his fifth career game, Jones did not make a single field goal against Bradley despite 10 attempts.
“I was finding my way as a freshman,” Jones said.
He finished the season averaging 9.9 points, 3.2 assists and two steals per game.
“[Jones] has played much better [in practices],” O’Neill said. “He has matured a lot and is a lot better of a player.”
Besides Jones, the Trojans only have three available guards on scholarship, and none have competed at the Division I level.
Alexis Moore, a 6-foot-2 freshman from Long Beach Poly, played point guard in high school. With Jones expected to play close to 40 minutes a game at point guard, however, Moore will compete for time as a shooting guard.
“My instinct is to pass first, but I am willing to help the team in any way that I can,” Moore said. “If [O’Neill] said to play center, I would try my best to play center.”
The Trojans will count on Byron Wesley, a 6-foot-5 freshman from Etiwanda, Calif., to provide scoring from the guard position, as well. He averaged 19.2 points per game as a senior in high school.
“[Wesley] is a really good shooter,” Jones said. “He can also drive the ball to get to the basket and make plays for us.”
Wesley could also be tasked with guarding the opponent’s best player after Marcus Simmons, the reigning Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year, graduated last May.
“[Simmons’ defensive] role is a big role to fill,” Wesley said. “My best attribute is defense. I just want to go out there and shut the other team’s best player down.”
Greg Allen, a 6-foot-3 junior who transferred from Navarro College, was brought in to replace the outside shooting of graduated guard Donte Smith, who converted 35 percent of his 3-point attempts last season. Allen shot nearly 40 percent from beyond the arc last season.
Despite being sidelined, Fontan contributes to the team by mentoring the three new guards and teaching them the plays.
Moore credits Fontan for aiding in his development.
“If I do not [understand] something on the floor, I go to [Fontan] before anyone else,” Moore said.
Given the lack of experienced guard depth behind Jones, O’Neill does not believe the team could survive a major injury to its captain.
“If we do not have [Jones], it will be difficult for us to be competitive in major college games,” O’Neill said. “Do not come to the games, it would be ugly.”

Three thousand miles away, the USC women’s tennis team is making some noise.
Just one day removed from becoming the first pair of Women of Troy to reach the semifinals of the ITA Indoor Doubles Championships, sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria took it one step further on Sunday by defeating Notre Dame’s Kristy Frilling and Shannon Mathews at the USTA Billie Jean National Tennis Center in Flushing, N.Y., to become ITA National Indoor doubles champions.
The win marks the most successful tournament run for a women’s doubles tandem since Christian and now-departed Maria Sanchez advanced to the NCAA women’s semifinals in May 2011.
This year’s duo, however, could turn out to be even more formidable.
Santamaria has enjoyed early success since taking the court for the Women of Troy. She burst onto the scene by winning the ITA Women’s Southwest Regionals in San Diego two weeks ago, and carried that momentum into the doubles tournament. Christian recently advanced to the semifinals of the Jack Kramer Invitational this past week.
Christian was quick to credit the newcomer Santamaria for the historic win.
“It’s so nice to have her at USC,” Christian said. “She’s a banger at the baseline and I like to be all over the net. That can’t complement any better.”
Santamaria, following her teammate’s lead, deflected the credit.
“I never thought this would happen,” she said upon reaching the finals. “[Christian’s] carrying me. It’s all her.”
In the championship match, it was Santamaria who shouldered the heavy load. She held in each of her service games to overcome five breaks of Christian’s serve.
“I was really focused,” Santamaria said. “I knew I had to hold my serve every single time, and if I didn’t we probably would not have won.”
After splitting the first two sets, Christian’s serve was broken after she switched to an underhand serve. That brought the Fighting Irish within 4-3 and in control of the serve. But Christian redeemed herself by putting away a volley on break point to take a 5-3 lead.
Santamaria served out the next game to clinch the victory, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Though their experience playing together at USC is fairly new, Christian and Santamaria actually have a history together.  The two were partnered together during their junior career, which began in the Girls’ 14s division of the USTA junior tournaments.
Even though they are just setting out on their USC tennis careers, Christian and Santamaria have already left their mark in the USC history books. They are the first USC doubles team — male or female — to win the doubles championship at the tournament.

Through two tournaments this weekend, No. 1 USC men’s tennis hoped to wrap up the fall preseason with one more fall singles title. Instead, they walked away with championships in doubles and consolation singles.
No. 66 sophomore Emilio Gomez paired up with freshman Yannick Hanfmann in the 55th Southern California Intercollegiate Championships at UCLA to capture the team’s first fall doubles title.
As the No. 1 seed in the 16-team doubles draw, Gomez and Hanfmann defeated No. 2-seed UCLA’s Clay Thompson and Alex Brigham 8-4 yesterday. En route to the finals, Gomez and Hanfmann defeated pairs from UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and Concordia.
“There’s a ton of room to improve, but it’s great they won today,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “To beat a UCLA team — that’s really good. I’m happy about that.”
On the same day, USC freshman Eric Johnson upended fellow Trojan freshman Jonny Wang 7-6 (5), 6-2 in the consolation singles finals. After both losing in the first round in the main draw, the freshmen entered the 16-player consolation draw and won three consecutive matches before facing off in the finals.
“It was fun playing a teammate. We both played really well,” Johnson said. “It was a really tight first set, but in the second I pulled away with it.”
The two also joined forces in the doubles draw, but lost 5-8 in the quarterfinals to Brigham and Thompson.
Brigham and Thompson also ended singles main draw runs for No. 1-seed Hanfmann and No. 2-seed Gomez. Thompson, seeded No. 3, upset Hanfmann 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals, while Brigham defeated Gomez 2-6, 6-4, 1-6 in the Round of 16.
“The key for this week was for the freshman to get some experience at UCLA, because the next time we go there, it’s not going to be so exciting,” Smith said.
USC sophomore Corey Smith also participated in the five-day competition, but could not make it out of the singles qualifying draw after losing to San Diego’s Andrew Raphaelson 6-7, 1-6.
As the five Trojans battled in Southern California, two other USC players tackled some tough competition in the prestigious USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.
No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 15 sophomore Ray Sarmiento entered a 32-player singles main draw that featured the top college tennis players in the nation.
In the first round, Nguyen faced off against No. 1-seed freshman Mitchell Frank of Virginia, losing 2-6, 2-6 to the eventual champion of the tournament. Frank has yet to lose a singles match in his intercollegiate career.
“[Frank] rarely made any mistakes, maybe one or two unforced errors,” Nguyen said. “He played solid and consistently throughout the match, and I made a few too many errors.”
Hours later, Sarmiento fell 4-6, 4-6 in the first round to No. 6-seed Chase Buchanan of Ohio State.
“[Buchanan] just starting pressing me more and being more aggressive,” Sarmiento said. “I started missing a lot, and he stepped up.”
Nguyen and Sarmiento then entered the consolation singles draw and both won a match before losing in the quarterfinals.
“They could’ve done better,” Smith said. “They just need to keep working. They can see that they’re some of the best players in the country, but unless they’re sharp and ready to go, they’re going to lose.”
Sarmiento earned his bid to the tournament after winning the singles title in the ITA Southwest Regionals in Malibu two weeks ago, while Nguyen qualified for advancing past the quarterfinals in the ITA Men’s All-American Tournament in Tulsa, Okla. in early October.
The two tournaments end USC’s fall preseason, leaving the team with two singles, one doubles and one consolation singles title for the fall.
USC’s next action awaits in January at the Sherwood Collegiate cup before they kick off the spring season and begin their journey for a fourth consecutive NCAA championship.
“We have to work our butts off,” Smith said. “We have two months to get ready, and if we work hard, we’ll have a chance to compete for a fourth.”

College credit proves costly
Internships are increasingly offered to college students requiring just the costly accompaniment of “college credit,” footed by students. Despite its hefty price tag, college credit is erroneously perceived as employers’ safety blanket in a society of legalities.
Though the Fair Labor Standards Act outlines six standards precluding an unpaid student from classification as a mistreated employee, employers frequently misinterpret the vague criteria, wrongly translating “college credit” as compliance with the law.
Though the six criteria outlined by the Fair Labor Standards Act are intended to emphasize an internship’s advancement of students’ education, the fourth criteria stating that employees must derive no immediate benefits from an unpaid intern’s activity has stirred employers’ fear of breaking the law and fueled the “college credit” safeguard myth.
When an internship is classified as part of a student’s education under the guise of college credit, employers perceive all activities performed by the student as components of a curriculum and protected from disputes of legality.
With the college credit internship, despite the steep cost of the often unnecessary credit, students are speculated to be the primary benefactors in the employer/unpaid intern relationship.
In today’s increasingly competitive job market, where a college education is unremarkable, students desperately seek a leg-up in their respective industries — and that means agreeing to unpaid work. Students have internalized the norm of exploitative pre-entry-level positions; if they don’t want to do the work for free, someone else will.
Coupled with America’s desperate economy in which recent grads must validate their worth, an excessively cutthroat attitude has threaded willingness to work without pay among today’s youth.
While unpaid internships are commonplace, employers must understand the legality of hiring unpaid interns in order to minimize the cost to students. Employers must understand that college-credit-only internships are costly to students and aren’t the defining merit of legal compliance.
Policymakers that created the Fair Labor Standards Act with the intention of protecting students need to reassess the consequences of its poorly worded policy.
It must clarify the criteria for unpaid interns to employers to abolish the myth of college credit and save students unwarranted expenses.

An aspect of college life students look forward to is cultural enrichment. For Conquest later this month, Program Board has announced that Cobra Starship will be performing.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Program Board should ensure that these big-ticket events aren’t the only ones getting the attention on campus.
The opportunity to attend concerts organized by USC’s Program Board, Thornton School of Music and various concerts held at venues such as Ground Zero Performance Cafe are numerous at USC.
These types of events, however, aren’t widely publicized to the student body.
As a result, it appears USC does not offer much as far as musical enrichment on campus. In reality, this university is boiling over with talent and free concerts that are often overlooked.
Having more concerts of varying genres is a productive way to bring the student body together.
USC needs to publicize events more often to cultivate and continue to bring students together.
“I only know of one concert that has been put on and that was during Welcome Week,” said Brentley Campbell, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Sadly, many students share this view, and it’s a shame because USC has so much free music to offer.
On Mondays, Ground Zero has open mic nights and, on Thursdays, “Jazz Nights” features musicians from Thornton. These concerts are only really publicized at the cafe.
If you live in don’t visit Ground Zero often, you will most likely miss out on the opportunities the cafe provides for free music.
Moreover, a capella groups regularly perform on campus though they too, are often under-publicized.
As a result of overlooking the multiple music niches around campus, students are sometimes disappointed with the Program Board’s concerts because the headliner doesn’t appeal to everyone.
Tokyo Police Club — the band for this semester’s Welcome Week — was not widely lauded by some students because their genre of music wasn’t exactly the mainstream radio music that many students listen to.
USC should make sure to publicize the events that go on through the year. Everyone can have his or her musical tastes satisfied.
Students could come together in spaces other than the three concerts put on by Program Board to meet new people and enjoy free music.
Only minutes away from the Nokia theatre and Staples Center, this campus is an ideal venue to bring many genres of music to one space to satisfy the varying musical interests of the students.
Yet it’s not enough to bring the music; it has to be noticed. Establishing a monthly newsletter that outlines all of the free concerts occuring on campus would be a wise first step in this direction.
Students don’t take advantage of all the free concerts. The university should seek to satisfy the different music interests on this campus by instead emphasizing the lesser-known concerts.
 
Karla Chavez is a freshman majoring in business administration. 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English. 
Ground Zero puts flyers around campus, but they don’t have budget or manpower that Program Board does to be having mass amounts of flyers printed and put up all over campus. They have free events every day though!
I believe there already is an online calendar of on-campus events in place; if you go to USC’s website there is an “Arts and events” calendar.
Interesting article, and great idea to develop a calendar for all the concert events at school.  However, please do your proper research into who puts on which concerts at USC before you. Beyond Program Board, KXSC, Spectrum, and Performance Venues all being separate entities that book separate shows, take a look at what each organization separately does to promote their events before you criticize the entire school for its shortcomings, and the students who put on the shows.
KXSC, the USC student radio station, hosts at least one free show a week, but our budget makes it hard to promote more. Let’s work together!
As aforementioned above, KXSC, the independent, student-run college radio station, is a great resource for free concerts that was overlooked in this article. KXSC continues to provide an alternative avenue for students to see local (and national) underground acts alongside other bigger acts such as Flying Lotus. At the very least, there is one concert per week as a part of the Live Show, which happens every Friday at Tommy’s Place from 1-2pm. There have been quality acts in general throughout the semester as well. You can find kxsc at http://www.kxsc.org.
If you want to put the Programs Board in contact with us, we will be more than happy to help bring shows to the public’s attention. We do have plenty of USC student readers and once word gets out on a site like ours all of the other L.A. blogs follow suit. Hit us up!
This article should also have included KXSC, the on-campus radio station, as a source for great free on-campus concerts!
Thank you Karla and Mellissa for writing this article. 
For those reading this article, however, I would like to bring to your attention KXSC Radio, USC’s student-run radio station–an organization that in the past has consistently held FREE concerts throughout the USC community (Tommy’s Place, Ground Zero, Founders Park) and the LA area (Space 1520, Origami Vinyl).  
KXSC (formerly KSCR) has been a part of USC since the mid-1970s. Today, we continue to offer the USC community 24 hour original programming (music, sports and news), FREE concerts and a hands on learning environment for both undergraduate and graduate students. 
For more information about KXSC Radio, please visit http://www.kxsc.org, http://www.facebook.com/KXSCRadio, and http://www.twitter.com/KXSC
Nice article!  I completely agree.  During my undergrad years at ‘SC I was on concerts committee and even I was unaware of how many great shows were going on throughout the year.  A newsletter would be amazing!  That way not just students, but local alumni etc, could also get in on the fun and help to support local musicians.

Anything in excess can be dangerous in the long run — even working out. Though exercise keeps your body strong and fit, continuous stress on your frame can result in physical problems you might not notice.
This recently happened to me; I was beginning to feel sore from my regular routine. A friend recommended yoga to help rejuvenate my muscles and joints. So last week I tried hatha yoga, a combination of specific stretches and positions, along with breathing exercises, designed to hone the physical and mental aspects of the body.
I’m open-minded to many physical activities, but I went into my yoga class expecting to work on balance, not to get a real workout or to solve my aches and pains.
I was wrong.
Many yoga movements emphasize balancing the body to stretch out every muscle. At first, the concept that holding stationary poses can be exercise seems paradoxical, but it worked better than I expected.
Yoga’s relief elements are particularly wonderful. Strength-training is effective for building muscle, but even with good form and pacing, too much training can lead to tight spots in the body and stiffness in the joints.
I was surprised more than anything to find — once in a pose for instance that required me to stand on one leg and make the rest of my body parallel to the ground — just how sore my back was. I thought my strength exercises had been harmless, but their detriments had snuck up on me, leaving me with more than a few stiff spots in my muscles. It was only through trying yoga that I realized how much harm weight training can do.
Yoga, however, isn’t just a way to heal the body; it’s a great way to relax and ease the mind. If done correctly, yoga can be a wonderful way to deal with the stresses of college life. I was surprised to find the classes I took were filled with businessmen doing yoga on their lunch breaks to supplement their health and fitness routines.
The slow tempo and attention to creating strong, continuous breathing routines make yoga a great way to step back from a busy schedule and rest. Though yoga isn’t exactly the same as a vacation filled with decadent catnaps, it can be implemented as an effective stress reliever.
The yoga class I took provided a strenuous workout — just not in the conventional sense of presses and curls. The constant stretches and balancing use bodyweight to test the muscles involved.
One particular routine involved turning to one side and bending the knees to sit in a squat-like pose, while keeping the hips squared. The position wasn’t that difficult at first, but when I had to hold it for a minute, it became a test of physical strength and stamina.
In the end, the benefits of doing yoga were obvious. My body wasn’t sore; it felt relaxed and my joints were no longer stiff. Practitioners say habitual yoga not only helps prevent those pains from returning but makes the body flexible and adaptive to the rigors of other, more physical exercises — running, sports and even strength-training.
One tip: Avoid weights for about three days after your first time doing yoga. Yoga is effective for relieving aches, but I found my body’s muscles were weak and still recovering. Take a few days off, enjoy the relaxation and don’t be foolish like I was, trying to do squats the next day.
Hatha yoga isn’t the ultimate key to healthy living, but it’s one of the best tools to keep long-term injuries at bay. And even if you aren’t suffering from aches and pains, yoga can provide a way to de-stress your schedule. Practicing yoga is a great way to maintain a healthy fitness routine and deal with an exhausting college lifestyle.

Roughly 10 years ago, beloved house music titan David Guetta was just beginning to make his mark on what would become the popular electronic music scene. One major factor in his rise to success, unbeknownst to many, was the powerhouse vocals and stylistic songwriting of Chris Willis, an American singer-songwriter known for his intense vocal range.
On top · Singer Chris Willis is becoming a force to reckon with in the electronic music scene. His latest project “Premium (Songs From the Love Ship) Part 1” dropped today — two more EPs will follow in the near future. - Photo courtesy of Shock Ink
Willis is featured on numerous well-known tracks spread throughout Guetta’s discography, including the classics “Love Don’t Let Me Go,” “Love Is Gone,” “Tomorrow Can Wait” and 2010’s smash-hit single, “Gettin’ Over You,” for which he received a Broadcast Music Inc. award.
Willis’ unprecedented success in the electronic music industry might come as a shock to those who know his life story. It all started in Dayton, Ohio, where Willis was raised in a community that took pride in their gospel music.
According to Willis, this style of upbringing built the foundation for his present success because of the massive role music played in his life from an early age. But Willis was not born with golden pipes; it took a lot of practice, disappointment and perseverance to land him where he is now.
From an early age, Willis was part of his local church’s choir, learning to sing gospel music. Eventually, Willis recorded his first solo gospel album on a Warner Brothers record label, but the label decided not to release it.
“‘No one knows your name so we’re not going to release this project’ [was what they said to me], and that was the biggest disappointment of my life,” Willis said. “That was a big blow from the gospel industry.”
Willis had faith in the industry as a whole, however, knowing he had what it took to make it and unwilling to part ways with the music he adored. He recorded another gospel album on a smaller record label, which was released, but lacked enough reception from the public for him to stay on the label.
Willis recalls the common record label perspective that came down to something as simple as supply and demand.
“The artists that were selling a lot of records remained on the label, and those of us that weren’t were dropped,” Willis said.
It was after this second blow from the gospel music industry that Willis gave himself permission to leave the industry to pursue other music styles he was already writing and performing. Willis did his best to stay positive with his experiences in the industry.
“It was a very agonizing journey, but it was a very fruitful one nonetheless,” Willis said.
Working as an apprentice under influential producer Desmond Child, Willis went to France to help produce the first English language album of French boy band 2Be3 in an attempt to break the group into the growing American boy band market.
Willis was introduced to French DJ and producer David Guetta by one of the band members. Swiftly and suddenly, Willis’ world turned upside down, returning to a recording studio with Guetta and producer Joachim Garraud the same night to write and record Guetta’s first hit single, “Just a Little More Love.” And that was only the beginning of Willis’ blooming career in electronic music.
Willis’ talents span much further than his incredible ability to leave listeners in awe with his powerful vocals. In 10 years of working with David Guetta, Willis co-wrote six of the 13 tracks on Guetta’s debut album Just a Little More Love, six of the 12 tracks on Guetta Blaster, four of the 12 tracks on Pop Life and many more.
His muse for songwriting became the dance floor. The mood of the dark, dimly lit floor and the concept of boy meets girl are common themes in his songwriting, and he even goes so far as to connect this muse with his foundation in gospel ideals.
“It’s almost like a religion where you can go to exorcise your demons. People that come to the club, they do it almost religiously,” Willis said. “It’s a commitment. … You pay your money, you put something in and you get something out.”
It’s obvious people love the songs Willis has contributed to. The first of three solo EPs, titled “Premium (Songs from the Love Ship) Part 1,” will be released today. Willis has already released two singles off of the EP: “Louder (Put Your Hands Up),” which has been steadily climbing dance music charts, and “Too Much in Love,” which serves as Willis’ homage to Lenny Kravitz.
Willis has faced his fair share of disappointment over the course of his career, but his latest release is his next big break. EP “Premium (Songs From the Love Ship) Part 1” is sure to please music fans of all backgrounds.

Los Angeles repertory theater company A Noise Within launched its 20th-anniversary season in a brand-new theater in Pasadena with a fresh production of Twelfth Night Or, What You Will.
Havana Nights· The cast of Twelfth Night infuses a vivacious, colorful energy as it dances the night away, engaging viewers with its charisma, in this updated take on a classic Shakespearean production. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
The Shakespearean comedy tells the classic tale of girl dresses as boy, girl falls in love with boy, girl reveals true identity to boy. The twisty plot follows Viola (Angela Gulner), who dresses as a man after washing up on the shores of a foreign land. Viola becomes the servant to Orsino (Robertson Dean), while Orsino secretly has feelings for Olivia (Abby Craden). Of course, being a full-length Shakespearean play, the farce has many other shining supporting characters and subplots as well.
This specific production of Twelfth Night, directed by A Noise Within co-founder and co-artistic director Julia Rodriguez-Elliot, generally stays true to the Bard’s original text, ye-Olde English and most other original elements — except for the setting.
Rodriguez-Elliot sets the romp in Cuba, which has little relevance to the plot but great aesthetic value. The Cuban theme makes the play visually vibrant and exciting, with makeshift palm trees, machetes and beach chairs used as major set pieces. These touches inject the play with a vivacious energy that wouldn’t have been present otherwise.
Despite the color and energy, the play’s setting, in a tropical location, is puzzling. In fact, the characters still refer to the land as “Illyria” even though it’s clearly Cuba. The setting has no relevance or impact on the plot; the production could have taken place anywhere and the story would have remained the same.
In spite of this misstep, Rodriguez-Elliot keeps the tone of the play consistently hysterical. While Shakespearean dialogue can be difficult to follow, strong directing choices ensure the comedy of the story is portrayed clearly.  Much of the comedy is achieved through the effective use of staging and space — entrances and exits are not confined to the stage but are instead dispersed throughout the theater, making the production feel personal, upbeat and farcical.
The strength of the performances also adds to the production’s entertainment value. Jeremy Rabb plays Sir Andrew Aguecheek masterfully, channeling a bumbling idiot with enough earnestness to make the character extremely likeable. Apollo Dukakis also stands out as Sir Toby Belch, a drunken fool with grand plans to have Aguecheek seduce his niece Olivia.
In fact, the play’s standout scenes include Belch and Aguecheek spying on Malvolio through some palm trees, adding a comedic flair. These standout scenes often feature Dukakis and Rabb, supporting characters whose strong comedic performances help make the production shine, despite their minor roles.
Abby Craden, who portrays a wonderfully narcissistic and persistent Olivia, is also notable. These aforementioned characters are so ridiculous and out of touch with reality that they provide a welcome contrast to the more melodramatic, bland lead characters of Viola and Orsino.
Though Gulner and Dean offer welcomed performances, the pair lacks chemistry. Viola is perfectly adept, but the relationship between her and Orsino does not seem believable. Not only is there an off-putting age difference between the two (he could easily be her father), but the connection simply isn’t there. Even when Orsino is under the impression that Viola is a man, the relationship does not seem very close, not even in a platonic sense.
And even after the big reveal that Viola has been posing as a man, their relationship seems to spring out of nowhere and has very little heat.
These blunders aside, Rodriguez has staged quite an enjoyable production of one of Shakespeare’s most loved comedies. The atmosphere is fun and festive and certain moments make for many laughs.
A Noise Within’s fun production of Twelfth Night runs through Dec. 16.

Florence & The Machine has moved from the body to the soul with sophomore album Ceremonials, and the band’s sound is more spiritual and polished. There’s more spectacle and grandeur, but the record doesn’t shirk introspection and subtlety.
In Ceremonials, Florence & The Machine evokes religious imagery, such as cathedrals, prayers, devils and sinners, without forfeiting its pagan luster; what Ceremonials holds divine is inspired from within.
For fans captivated by the sound of Florence & The Machine’s debut record Lungs, it might take two or three listens to truly appreciate Ceremonials, as the album certainly lacks the animalistic bite and bloodlust of the band’s first release. The new songs won’t set listeners’ teeth on edge the same way “Girl with One Eye” or “Howl” did.
Similar to Lungs, however, Ceremonials will grow on listeners, revealing more layers and nuances with each listen.
Ceremonials begins with “Only If For A Night,” a solid song that sets the emotional precedent for the album. The song tells the story about a dream singer Florence Welch had of her deceased grandmother. Welch’s echoing voice swells over piano, violins and cellos as she hauntingly reminisces over loss and love.
The beginning of the album is slow in comparison to Lungs, which begins with the catchy hit “Dog Days Are Over,” but the emotional and mystical weight on “Only If For A Night” cement it as the appropriate album-opener.
Next on the album is “Shake It Out,” the record’s first official single and easily its most stunning song. “Shake It Out” starts off slow and haunting, building anticipation lyrically until it finally delivers an exquisite punch with an explosive and impassioned chorus.
The beginning lines — Regrets collect like old friends / here to relive your darkest moments / I can see no way, I can see no way / And all of the ghouls come out to play — are poetic and rich, simultaneously evoking pain, fear and beauty. “Shake It Out” completely embodies the spiritual grandeur the album strives to achieve.
Ceremonials’ experimental sound sets the album apart as a new work of art. A number of the songs are spookier with gospel-tinged organs, sour-sounding string sections and low thrumming guitar lines.
But the band hasn’t strayed too far from the familiar. The airy harps featured on some of the transitional songs are still present, as well as the pounding, rhythmic drums that lend themselves to emotional weight and urgency, but the scarcity of these instruments makes them all the more potent. In addition to familiar instruments, the intensity that marked certain songs on the first album has carried over and manifested itself in the track “Seven Devils.”
If long-time Florence & The Machine fans need something more to sink their teeth into, “Seven Devils” is it. The track is characterized by a sharp, unsettling piano melody that sounds redolent of an old horror film.  With lyrics like Holy water cannot help you now / A thousand armies couldn’t keep me out / I don’t want your money / I don’t want your crown / See, I’ve come to burn your kingdom down, the song conjures a much-needed eeriness. The song’s message is vengeful and deadly and the tone is dark, showing off Welch’s beautiful and urgent voice.
“Lover To Lover” doesn’t quite fit in the album, but it’s still a lively, soulful song that sounds like classic gospel with its organ, tambourine, drums and clapping.
The penultimate track “All This And Heaven Too” brings an emotional impact second only to “Shake It Out.” It evokes yearning and introspection, still sounding completely euphoric. Welch smartly avoids conventional trappings, as the song could have easily become a typical love song about another person. Instead, the song goes a step beyond, examining a personal understanding of one’s own heart.
Listening to Ceremonials is a dark, spiritual experience with enough euphoria to make it emotionally satisfying and even a bit overwhelming at times. Welch’s powerful voice leaves you wanting nothing more and the compelling, abstract lyrics contain almost all of the richness found on Lungs. Though it’s not quite as strong as the band’s debut, Ceremonials is still an impressive release.

The foreign tourists, along with their Nepalese guides, traveled to Lukla — the starting point for trekkers who wish to scale the world’s largest mountain. However, inclement weather forced more than 2,200 tourists to take shelter in this village where food supplies are limited.
According to the International Business Times, hotels were reportedly overflowing as the influx of tourists waited for a flight out of the Tenzing-Hillary airport.
“The target is to transport 1,500 tourists to Kathmandu today,” Hari Basyal, spokesman of the Nepal Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation told CNN.
On Sunday, at least 500 trekkers were flown to the capital, and today 48 helicopter rides were flown out of Lukla. Meanwhile, trekkers at higher altitudes on Everest were asked not to descend to Lukla because there is no space left. The BBC reported that hotels of the Solukhumbu District were forced to provide sleeping quarters for tourists in their dining rooms, while their guides and porters slept outside.
There were no reports of health issues during the day. However, tourists were concerned about expired visas, missed flights and jobs back at home.

A new supplemental U.S. Census measure estimates that a full 16 percent of Americans are living in poverty, an increase from official reports that put 15.1 percent at poverty level.
Forty-nine million Americans struggle to make ends meet under the experimental Supplemental Poverty Measure released Nov. 7, which was designed to better capture the picture of poverty that the current measurement strategy used by the Census.
The official Census measure uses the amount a family spends on food to calculate the Federal Poverty Line, which is used nationally for eligibility into programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. The estimate relies on the assumption that a family spends about a third of its income on food.
The supplemental estimate incorporates how much an average family should spend on food, utilities, clothing and rent.
A family of four with an income of $24, 343 in 2010 is considered to be living in poverty under the supplemental measure, compared with $22,113 in the official measure.
The rising costs of medical care contributed in large part to the rising number of seniors in poverty under the new calculation, Census Bureau economist Kathleen Short told the Washington Post.
In addition, supplemental numbers show the West Coast has the highest percentage of people in poverty, at 19.4 percent.
Officials say that the Supplemental Poverty Measure is not intended to replace the official measurement strategy, but should be used to provide a better picture of the American economy.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced Sunday evening that he would step down halfway through his four-year term if the 130 million euro bailout plan is passed. Papandreou came to the decision after an evening meeting with Antonis Samaras, who leads the opposing New Democracy party to Papandreou’s PASOK party.
The proposed euro bailout deal would consist of rescue loans and support for banks, with the goal of allowing Greece to decrease its debts so it can independently manage its financial situation without the helping hand of further bailouts. The bailout also grants banks and private investors the ability to write off half of their Greek debt holdings.
In addition, Greece’s political parties came to an agreement that they would form a new national unity government. According to MarketWatch, Papandreou reportedly said, “I will do whatever I can to help form a coalition government. The Oct. 26 decisions and obligations stemming from this are a condition for the country remaining in the euro.”
In one of his most controversial decisions that sent repercussions throughout the European economy, Papandreou denied a previous call for a referendum on Greece’s most recent bailout package. In response, European leaders had to halt the release of aid that had been previously approved, raising investor fears in an already turbulent European market.
Papandreou’s announcement will put immense pressure on political leaders to come to a decision on the bailout. If political turmoil persists and prevents the EU and IMF from granting loans, Greece could potentially default on its 360 billion euro ($465 billion) debt.
Papandreou and Samaras will meet again on Monday to decide who will succeed Papandreou and who will make up the new Cabinet.
