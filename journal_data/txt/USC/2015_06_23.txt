There are a lot of people in China. That reality is no more apparent than in the most populous city in the country and in the world, Shanghai. With a population around 24 million, Shanghai boasts an eclectic group of people who have contributed to its rich history and newly cosmopolitan setting. To visit and feel fully immersed in the “Paris of the East,” there are a couple of must-see landmarks.
Shanghai’s most famous destination is undoubtedly The Bund, a waterfront area which separates the city with the Huangpu River into two distinct centers, Pudong and Puxi. The Bund overlooks Shanghai’s futuristic skyline on the Pudong side, which is composed of the famous Oriental Pearl Tower and record-holding skyscrapers. In the background, in Puxi, the Gothic and art deco buildings of Old Shanghai, still open for commercial operation, reflect the city’s former European influence.
Though subways connect Pudong and Puxi, the best way to experience the city is to take a short, scenic ferry ride to Pudong. Not far from the dock is the Oriental Pearl Tower, a place now shrimpy compared to its gigantic neighbors but perhaps Shanghai’s most beloved building. Around $30 gets a ticket to the skywalk portion of the tower, where the floors and walls are made of glass. At close to 850 feet up in the air, this destination may induce vertigo but makes for great pictures. Also of note is the basement of the television tower, which houses a museum detailing the history of Old Shanghai.
Taking the ferry back to Puxi, Nanjing Road, only a block from The Bund, is the next place to go. The Times Square of Shanghai, Nanjing Road is a pedestrian street and the epicenter of shopping in Shanghai. International brands— —including Apple, Gap and various fast food chains—mix with Chinese brands at this shopping mecca. As the street is a far stretch, those tired of walking can ride a trolley all the way to the People’s Square, which signals the end of the pedestrian street.
A couple blocks away from Nanjing Road is Yuyuan Garden, another tourist hotspot. In 1577, during the Ming Dynasty, a government official built this garden as a sign of respect for his elderly parents. After its initial inhabitants, the garden went through many cycles of destruction and restoration until 1956, when the government reconstructed the garden and opened it to the public. Now, Yuyuan is lined with Shanghai novelty stores selling souvenir trinkets and famous eats. A visit to Yuyuan would not be complete without a stop at Nanxiang Mantou Store, where Shanghai-style dim sum dishes are sold. A must-purchase from the menu and authentic only in Shanghai is the xiaolongbao, a type of soup dumpling made with crab meat. When the meal is finished, tour the former living quarters tucked away in the farthest corner of the garden.
For another taste of Chinese architecture, go to Tianzifang, an area consisting of maze-like alleys on Taikang Road. At the turn of the 19th century, parts of Shanghai were controlled by the French government. Thus, that part of history has left behind an architectural style combining European and Chinese elements exclusive to Shanghai — Shikumen. Unlike parts of Old Shanghai demolished to make room for large commercial establishments, Tianzifang has preserved its residential quarters dating back to the 1930s. Now, cafes, restaurants and other shops have taken over what were once family homes, becoming one of Shanghai’s biggest tourist attractions. With neat rows of houses reaching no taller than two stories high, it’s a nice disparity from the skyscrapers for which Shanghai is known.
Because Shanghai is a cacophonous symphony of congested traffic, construction and loud chatter, the Jing’an Temple can be a refuge and the perfect denouement to the trip. For less than $10, the temple, with its signature gold rooftops, provides visitors with more 780 years of history. Featuring gold rooftops and architecture even older than that of Yuyuan, the temple instills peace in visitors.
Ultimately, a visit Shanghai proves that it is a city that should not be left off the lists of cosmopolitan centers in the world, rivalling New York, Tokyo and, of course, Paris. The very fabric of the city unveils an extensive history influenced by different parts of the world. It’s a place that 24 million people are proud to call home.

On the first Saturday of every month, people gather at Westwood’s Landmark Regent Theatre at midnight. Some have been before, some have just come with friends and some have no idea what to expect. Everyone is there to see The Room. But it’s not a new movie, nor an old classic. Released in 2003, The Room almost immediately gained a level of fame reserved for a very special and rare kind of film. Its claim to fame? It’s the worst movie ever made. That might be a contentious point, but when fans come to watch the movie monthly, everyone leaves their judgment at the door (or in their pocket — as one of the film’s characters would say) and comes in for a one-of-a-kind experience.
Maybe a brief explanation of the movie itself is in order. Something of a romantic drama that follows the life of a man whose life slowly starts to crumble as his girlfriend cheats on him, to say that this movie has a plot at all is probably giving it too much credit. It has all the perfect qualities of the best bad movie. It is written, directed, produced and starred in by the same person, Tommy Wiseau. The script is illogical and jumps from scene to scene, characters are introduced at random and disappear and Wiseau’s indistinguishable accent makes even the most understandable lines nonsensical. At this point, one might ask why people watch this movie in the first place — and that is a question that can only be answered by experiencing it for yourself. The Room crosses the very fine line between good and bad movies, residing in a limbo all its own.
While watching the movie at home is a hilarious and worthwhile experience in itself, the real immersive experience comes with going to see it with a big group. Movie theaters across the country have started regularly showing The Room, and L.A.’s most common host is the Westwood Regent. The movie starts at midnight, but on a particularly busy night the line to get in can start getting long as early as 11 p.m. For best choice of seats, it’s always a best bet to go early (and maybe pick up some Diddy Riese cookies to keep you company while you wait).
Once inside, the theater manager will explain The Room rules, bewildering to newcomers but familiar to veterans. Don’t throw spoons directly at the screen (plastic spoons are tossed in the air every time a prop-framed picture of a spoon is in the shot), no throwing footballs (in order to imitate the characters who do so almost constantly) and no laser pointers (to highlight inconsistencies and weird visuals). And with that, it begins.
The audience interacts with the movie Rocky Horror Picture Show-style; that is, everyone has certain things to say in response to prompts from the movie, such as yelling, “Water!” each time a body of water is on screen and screaming at the characters to shut the door. Outside of these standbys, depending on the audience, you get different commentary throughout the film that can make you laugh until you cry and change the way you see it forever. It’s this element of surprise that makes it possible to come and see The Room ritually — even if you’ve been before, it’ll be a different movie every time because there’s a different audience.
For the recent June screening, Tommy Wiseau — writer, director, producer, star — was actually at the Regent for a Q&A and to give a preview of his new TV show, The Neighbors. Throwing footballs around with fans in line before the film, Wiseau sold and signed merchandise with quotes from the movie and then went inside for an almost indecipherable set of answers to audience questions. By making the worst movie ever, he and the entire cast have become legendary in a way none of them probably expected, and Wiseau is making the most of it. The loyalty of The Room’s fans is maybe even more than fans of real franchises — first-time visitors to a screening might feel as though they accidentally stumbled upon the meeting of a cult. But instead, it’s a hilarious bonding experience, one that might add years to your life from laughter.
The next screening will be held at the Regent Theatre in Westwood on  Saturday, July 11, at 11:59 p.m.

It’s hard to believe that it was exactly four months ago that I arrived at Ezeiza International Airport with hardly any idea what the semester had in store for me. I remember the nervous feeling I had finding my way around the city, searching for an apartment and then finally deciding on the international student house that I would quickly come to call home and where I would make some of my closest friends.
It is funny to think about how at first I would budget a lot of extra time to get places, believing I was expected to be there right on time and knowing that the buses were unpredictable, but I soon became accustomed to getting places on “Argentina time.”
With all of these incredible experiences in Buenos Aires, I have acclimated and become fond of many things I will miss more than I would have thought. Things that at first were cultural quirks have now become part of my daily life.
I will miss the relaxed porteño time, being able to not worry if I was a little late to meet someone because it is known that the buses can be unpredictable to the strange eating schedule I grew so fond of. Eating a 10 p.m. dinner and going out during the early hours of the morning meant that I could go to class, meet someone for coffee, run errands, take a nap and do my homework, all before sitting down to enjoy the Argentines’ most important meal of the day.
I will miss the incredibly friendly people who I was never afraid to approach on the street to ask for directions or suggestions, knowing they would always be willing to stop what they were doing to help me find my way and maybe even walk me there.
I will miss the food. The meat that can make vegetarians rethink their life choices, the empanadas so delicious you never grow tired of them and the ice cream so creamy any dieter would make every day a cheat day.
I will miss living in a city where you don’t need a car. A place with multiple modes of public transportation, not to mention so many different bus lines that you’ll always be able to get to where you’re going without having to consider hailing a taxi.
Surprisingly, I will miss the small, specialized stores for each different grocery need.  Even though at first I thought I would be annoyed I couldn’t just make a one-stop shop, I quickly found beauty in being able to go to a specialized place and know  I was getting freshly grown produce or bread that had been baked that morning — all at the best prices.
There are a few things though that I won’t be too sad to leave behind. Things that I will be able to do without, until I return of course.
For starters, I won’t miss the Argentine napkin. It can be classified as a napkin simply because it is often the only material offered to wipe your hands on during your meal. In reality, it is more like a little piece of wax paper that never makes you feel quite clean. I always end up having to use a lot of them, and they end up as little wads cluttering the table.
I will not miss the dog poop-covered sidewalks. Though I’ve never been unlucky enough to step in any while exploring the city streets (knock on wood), I don’t think I’ve gone a day without wondering why in the world people think it’s OK to let their dogs do their business in the middle of the sidewalk and then just leave it there.
I won’t miss the city-wide transportation strikes that put a hold on everyone’s day and make it impossible to get to work or school.
I also won’t miss the lines. Though I understand that no one is ever in a rush, and therefore, the lines don’t seem to bother people, I don’t get why you must wait in a queue of 15 plus people just to go to the bank or buy your groceries.
Most of all, I won’t miss the honking or cat-calling that my friends and I constantly ignore even when we want more than anything to tell off the men who insist on heckling us. It saddens me that in a society that is making strides to empower women, this daily occurrence has not been addressed. It’s to the point that my professor explained to me that young women who grow up here don’t feel valued if they don’t get this “attention” in the streets.
To be clear, the positives of this country outweigh the negatives more than I can explain, and by no means will these few annoyances keep me from returning to this city that I hope to one day  call my second home.  Though my studies are just about up, it doesn’t feel like goodbye, but rather goodbye for now.

The USC women’s soccer team welcomed two transfer students to the roster for the fall.
The additions of midfielders Sydney Myers from Santa Clara and Amanda Rooney from North Carolina were announced June 19.
Myers made her collegiate debut last year in eight games for the Santa Clara Broncos. Myers also had an impressive high school career, leading her club team, Black Diamond SC, to Utah State Cup wins in both 2010 and 2013.
The Utah native told the Santa Clara Broncos in 2014 that in addition to soccer she enjoys boating, running and skiing.
Rooney comes to USC with slightly more experience, having played for the Tar Heels for two seasons. In 2014 she played six games, recording one assist and one shot on goal.
Before her career with North Carolina, Rooney captained the Albertson Elite Fury of Long Island, New York. She helped lead the Long Island Fury to a national championship in 2009.
Head coach Keidan McAlpine is optimistic about the future of the program with the addition of these two players.
“We are excited to add such great young women, gifted students and talented soccer players to our program,” McAlpine told USC Trojans. “As we strive to build on the foundation of last season, we expect these women to impact our future in a significant way.”

Golf can certainly be looked down upon as a sport for athletically inept, rich old men who like to drink beer.  But, those are just stereotypes of a sport that is on the brink of what could be one of its most exciting eras in recent history.
Young gun Jordan Spieth has just entered legendary status with his U.S. Open win this Father’s Day.  At 21, he is the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923, a remarkable 92-year statistic. Spieth is at just the beginning of what many predict will be a fruitful and possibly historic career.
With the victory on Sunday, Spieth has won the first two legs of the ever-elusive Grand Slam — winning all four major golf tournaments in a calendar year — entering into an elite club of golfers. Only six other men in the history of the game have won the first two legs: Craig Wood, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan (twice), Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and, most recently, Tiger Woods in 2002.  Entering a conversation with any of these names is significant enough to define a career, and yet, Spieth is just getting started.
Spieth’s victory at the U.S. Open should not be undermined by the massive collapse that Dustin Johnson had to execute in order to lose the tournament.  Golf is not just about one hole, though scores can rapidly change; it is about the 72 holes that go into a week of play and even longer than that in preparation.
Speculation about the Grand Slam came immediately during the trophy presentation interview, and Spieth provided a quotable and humble response simply saying,  “You can’t win them all if you don’t win the first two.”
Could Spieth be ushering in a new age of golf along with fellow twenty-something Rory McIlroy? The duo is the most talked about young pair since the faux rivalry between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.
This new age is undoubtedly the most exciting era that golf has seen since Father Time has begun to catch up with Mickelson and Woods was involved with his series of off-the-course scandals.
The Open Championship, known as the British Open and the next of golf’s four major tournaments, will be held from July 12-19 at St. Andrews, the home of golf in the U.K.  McIlroy is favored heading into the tournament, but that could be purely due to his home-course advantage over the Texan from across the pond.
Viewers will be holding their breath to see how Spieth reacts to a new and unpredictable pressure heading into the back nine of the majors.  Will he suffer a relapse and have to wait to finish out the career Grand Slam that many distinguished golfers still lack?  Or will he enter the tournament with all the poise and confidence he has exhibited thus far in his career and suddenly turn the PGA Championship into a must watch on his quest for history?
Spieth has breathed new life into a game that desperately needs a savior.  Not only is he young enough to capture the attention of fans not yet middle-aged, but he is also American, something to capture the hearts of the United States in a game that has recently seemed dominated by foreigners.
So here’s to hoping that Jordan Spieth can silence the critics and win the Open in July, bringing along with him a new fan base and enthusiasm for a highly underrated sport.

After winning both the 100m and 200m dashes at the 2015 NCAA Championships on June 12, junior Andre De Grasse was named the 2015 National Men’s Track Athlete of the Year by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association on June 17.
De Grasse became the second Trojan in three seasons to win the award, after Bryshon Nellum won in 2013.
De Grasse began his record-breaking day with the 100m dash, posting a time of 9.75 (+2.7w), his personal record. Though he was aided in part by the wind, his time is the fastest any-condition time run by a Canadian athlete, the second fastest any-condition time by a collegiate runner and a tie with Tyson Gay’s time at the 2008 Olympic Trials for the-fastest any-condition time at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.
Forty-five minutes after this historic win, De Grasse won the 200m with a time of 19.58 (+2.4w), the world-leading any conditions time. De Grasse became the first Trojan to win both the 100m and 200m dashes at the NCAA Championships since Clancy Edwards did so in 1978.
Both times ranked in the top 10 fastest performances in world history in all conditions.
In addition to these individual events, De Grasse also ran the second leg for USC’s 4x100m relay. The team placed fourth with a time of 38.75.
This wasn’t De Grasse’s only impressive award win of the year. He also was named the 2015 Pac-12 Men’s Track Athlete of the Year after an impressive showing at the Pac-12 Championships May 16-17, which earned him a spot at the NCAA Championships. De Grasse again won both the 100m and 200m races and ran on USC’s winning 4x100m relay. His 100m and 200m performances at the conference meet were also historic, as his 100m time of 9.97 (+0.6) set the USC, Pac-12 Meet and UCLA Drake Stadium record. His semifinal 200m time of 20.03 (-0.1) not only tied him for second on USC’s all-time list, but also set the Canadian record.
The NCAA Championships capped off the Ontario native’s first season at USC after he transferred from Coffeyville Community College in Kansas. De Grasse has another year of eligibility if he wishes to return.

As if President Obama’s long list of failed promises for reformations within the economic, healthcare and immigration sectors weren’t enough, he and his administration are now striving to build a “legacy” filled with more extreme policy measures that even his biggest supporters cannot seem to comprehend. The Obama administration’s most recent radically leftist move under the Department of Housing and Urban Development seeks to allow the federal government to impose a serious governmental overreach, mandating money from taxpayers to be allocated toward a fund that would allow low-income families to live in wealthier neighborhoods.
This measure, framed by the HUD as alleviating the issue of lack of diversification in wealthy neighborhoods, confuses discrimination with preference. The rollout of the new measure would begin its damage by gathering key intel on a community’s overall race, ethnicity and income distribution. After the data is gathered, HUD would micro-target communities that are seemingly “racist” due to their lack of diversity. But as many have said, diversification within affluent communities is not an issue of racism. It is an issue of economic integration, and the federal government pressuring local municipalities to implement low-income housing is an invasion of government control and individual preference.
In a perfect world, all individuals would have the opportunity to live in Martha’s Vineyard, rarely work or pay bills and live extravagantly. But the simple truth is that we are not living in a utopian society, and the Obama administration cannot expect citizens to allow taxpayer dollars to fund low-income individuals to live in the wealthiest neighborhoods. I’m not saying this because I do not support having the opportunity to live in affluent communities — I simply cannot wrap my head around the fact that the proposed regulations would seriously enforce municipalities to over accommodate.
Let’s not forget about the implications of enforcing neighborhoods such as these to accommodate for low-income residents — property values would plummet and extra funding would be necessary to create infrastructure. How can we expect easy transitions among individuals who are unable to afford living in these neighborhoods in the first place? At grocery stores in wealthier communities, for example, will low-income residents still be able to use food stamps to cover the higher prices of necessities? I highly doubt the high costs will be covered by pre-existing government programs.
The way in which HUD targets about 1,250 expensive neighborhoods takes a punch at the American Dream by equivocating “expensive” communities with “racist” communities; but, this is not a race issue. This is not an issue of alleviating infringement upon equal opportunity, affordable housing or fair housing. This is an attempt to integrate everyone based on the mistaken belief that minorities are unable to live in wealthy neighborhoods. Quite frankly, this set of regulations shines a light on yet another way to segregate minorities from the rest of the nation when there is no issue at hand. To assume that all minorities are poor is racist in itself, if you ask me.
Individuals are in no way barred from living in wealthier neighborhoods. In fact, under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, it is illegal to discriminate in buying, selling and leasing properties. This proposal, however, would take the Fair Housing Act too far by asking local governments to provide support to low-income minorities seeking housing in wealthy communities.
Rather than attempting to make low-income residents completely abandon their neighborhoods, the HUD should mandate taxpayer dollars to revamp low-income communities. The interpretation of the American Dream has surely changed within the last few centuries, but the symbolism behind the set of ideals has not. Working hard to achieve the financial means to live in wealthy communities is a way to grasp the concept of upward social mobility. Why must we punish communities for holding onto the idea of working hard to achieve more?
American economist Milton Friedman once said, “One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.” It might appear that I’m criticizing a policy that doesn’t have a result yet. We can already predict, however, that the results of the program will be disastrous not only by simple principle and logic, but also by the rollout of a similar HUD program from 20 years ago, which proved to be catastrophic.
Again, this is not an issue of racial integration; affluent communities include all races that are able to afford homes there. Economic integration will not happen by government intervention. In fact, intervention will only push us further away from achieving that goal.

The more government “does” the more it “takes”
Agree. This is just another form of wealth redistribution by the Obama Admin. If implemented, the results will be catastrophic form the neighborhoods affected.

The mass shooting that took place on June 17 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, has been the subject of widespread discussion and controversy across the United States.  The gunman, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man, organized the attack on the basis of racial prejudice, attempting to start a “race war” on people of color.  Though anger and sadness have been acknowledged across the country, many believe that early reports failed to recognize the severity of the occurrence.
The brutal attack was initially referred to as a “tragedy” by news reports and regarded as an “accident” by Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry. Mainstream media then had no hesitations in labeling the massacre a “hate crime.” Many were outraged by the fact that the crime was not reported as a terrorist attack, or even regarded as an act of terrorism in general.  The media’s misrepresentation of the event can be traced, however, to the reality of white privilege in the United States.
White privilege, which is the combination of social, political and economic privileges that benefit white people in Western countries beyond what is commonly experienced by non-white people, is ubiquitous in the U.S.  Though many politicians and commentators, such as Bill O’ Reilly, refuse to believe that white privilege is legitimate, the media’s distortion of the shooting can be directly attributed to it.  For the most part, white people are not seen or stereotyped as threatening, whereas people of color are deemed to be untrustworthy or violent, even when unarmed, in a white-dominated society.
The media unconsciously excuses the act committed by Roof by saying that such actions are results of a “mental illness” or the exposure of negative stimuli, such as “Internet evil.” On the other hand, New York Times writer John Eligon referred to Mike Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by police in 2014, as “no angel.” Eligon notes that Brown “lived in a community that had rough patches” and had “dabbled in drugs and alcohol.” If Roof had been a black man who attacked a white church, he would very likely be labeled as a “thug.” Derogatory assumptions would then be made based on the color of his skin.
Major news sites, such as Reuters, which included a source calling Roof “quiet and soft-spoken,” and CNN, which addressed a court scene in which the “victim’s kin say, ‘I forgive you,’” unconsciously demonstrate Roof’s white privilege. When an unarmed black teenager is portrayed by news media as more unethical than a white mass murderer, one can assume that society judges individuals using racial stereotypes and prejudice. What happened in Charleston is a blatant act of terrorism and should be treated as such, and the media’s failure to do so is a precise example of how white-washed the U.S. appears to be. Daily Show host Jon Stewart shined mainstream light on this subject, suggesting that if Roof had been Muslim, no one would have hesitated to label the crime as a terrorist attack. Stewart also said, “Al-Qaeda, all those guys, ISIS. They’re not sh*t compared to the damage that we can apparently do to ourselves on a regular basis.”
White privilege is an urgent and present issue, especially in the diverse communities within USC. Several severe cases of racial profiling have unfortunately taken place around campus. In order to change the overall perceptions of race in this country, we must first acknowledge the existence of white privilege and how people of different colors are treated. Once this phenomenon is universally accepted, we should then take the proper steps to achieve full equality among all races.
Black privilege manifests itself in numerous forms:
 Blacks have the right to take pride in their race. Whites don’t.
 Blacks can never be racist. Whites are always racist, even if they don’t try to be.
 Blacks get to play the race card. Whites don’t.
 Blacks never have to feel guilty about being black. Whites are trained to feel guilty about being white.
 Blacks have the right to make blacks only organizations like the Black Student Union and the Congressional Black Caucus. Whites don’t.
 Blacks have the right to never take responsibility for their own actions. Anything bad which happens to a black person can be blamed on racism or white people. Whites have to take responsibility and apologize for their actions.
 Rich black people have a right to be rich. Rich white people don’t.
 Black people have the right to demonize white people. White people don’t have the right to demonize black people.
 Black people are excused when they are prejudiced against white people. White people are never excused for prejudice against black people.
 Black people are a “protected class.” White people are not.
 Violent crimes by whites on blacks are “hate crimes.” Violent crimes by blacks on whites are just “random” crimes.
 Blacks have the right to affirmative action and minority set-asides. Whites have to earn their positions.
 Blacks are “cool.” Whites are “squares” and “rednecks.”
 Blacks have the right to say words like “nigger,” which whites are never allowed to use. They have the right to incessantly repeat the word “nigger” in front of white people, to intimidate them and keep them in their place. .
Blacks can make the most racially insensitive comments and, more often than not, no one blinks twice. They are allowed to insult others without repercussion.[1]
Blacks can spend their rent money on designer handbags and then complain about how they don’t have the same economic opportunities as everyone else. And they get away with it.[2]
 Black men are sexual supermen. White men are sexually inadequate. Black men have huge penises. White men have small, inadequate penises.
 Blacks have “civil rights”. Whites don’t.
 Blacks are in prison because of racism. Whites are in prison because they’re criminals.
 Black jury members have the right to acquit criminals, if they’re black.
 Blacks have the right to put a halt to any policy, statement, symbol, statistic, outcome, word or expression they find offensive. Whites have no such rights.
 Blacks are morally superior to whites.
 “[Blacks] enjoy cultural cache around the world as victors over oppression and the hard reality of what that looks like at this point in world history. The music that they enjoy, the clothes that they wear, their very mannerisms carry a certain amount of gravitas.”[3]
 Blacks can assign collective racial guilt to “you white folks.”  White people cannot do the reverse because that would be racist.
 White people everywhere, and at all times, bear guilt for the crimes of a minority of white people in the past (e.g., slave owners, Adolf Hitler). Making blacks bear guilt, as a race, for the despicable crimes of their criminal minority is stereotyping, racist, and an insult to reason; after all, no one should ever be blamed for the acts of some unrelated person.
 Blacks have “black culture.” Whites are not allowed to have white culture.
 African-American studies is a celebration of blackness and black culture. Whiteness studies is a demonization of white people and white culture.
 White people need to undergo diversity/sensitivity training. Black people don’t.
 “… any generalization–favorable or unfavorable–about any minority that someone does not like is by definition “racist” and deserves to be suppressed–as long as it is said by a white person. Black diversity consultants, in contrast, can parade, without a shred of empirical evidence, the grossest racial and ethnic stereotypes with virtual impunity.”[4]
 It’s racist to point out racism by blacks. It’s never racist to point out racism by whites.
 Whites have to walk on eggshells around blacks. Blacks don’t give a shit what whites think.
 Blacks have the right to riot and commit violent acts in response to perceived grievances. White people have to obey the law at all times.
 Blacks have the right to never be portrayed as criminals or lowlifes in films or on TV. Bad guys on the screen must always be White.
 Blacks have the right to never be ridiculed, mocked, belittled or laughed at. Whites have no such right.
 Black criminals have the right to have their race censored in media reports.
 Facts which cause blacks embarrassment or cast them in a bad light must be suppressed.  Facts which cause whites embarrassment or cast them in a bad light are reported as is.
 Blacks can silence and intimidate whites by calling them racist. Whites can’t silence and intimidate blacks because that would be racist.
 Forcing whitey to apologize shows black power and clout. Whites can never force blacks to apologize because that would constitute a lynching.
 Whites are held to a system of ‘sensitivity’ requirements that do not apply to blacks.
 “Whites are monitored, pestered, and punished for preposterous reasons–for a look, for an innocent word, for wearing a T-shirt, for expressing a plausible argument–but blacks can say almost anything with perfect impunity.”[5]
 “In discussions of race between black people and white people the conscious black person is always right; is always the ultimate authority on questions having to do with race and racism; must always be regarded as the ‘injured party,’ or the oppressed. . . . [Whites] cannot possibly be expected to be objective about questions of race.”[6]
 Blacks may work for explicitly racial goals but whites may not.
 Blacks are permitted to notice race. Whites are not.
 “It is quite acceptable for either party to explicitly go after the black, Hispanic, or even the Jewish vote. In fact both parties gain an indispensable moral authority by doing so. But it is absolutely verboten for either party, or any white candidate, to appeal to whites as a racial identity group. Racial identity is simply forbidden to whites in America and across the entire Western world. Black children today are hammered with the idea of racial identity and pride, yet racial pride in whites constitutes a grave evil. Say ‘I’m white and I’m proud’ and you are a National Socialist.”[7]
 A black who punches a White person is a hero standing up to oppression. A White person who punches a black is a racist.
 It can be publicly admitted that blacks are superior to Whites in certain pursuits (i.e. basketball). It can never be publicly admitted that Whites are superior to blacks in other pursuits (i.e. winning Nobel prizes in science).
 When blacks are overrepresented in a desirable field, it is due to their abilities.  When Whites are overrepresented in a desirable field, it is due to racism. When blacks are overrepresented in an undesirable field, it is due to racism. When Whites are overrepresented in an undesirable field, it is their own fault.
 Most African countries are made up almost entirely of blacks, and have some of the world’s highest birth rates. Most European countries consist of White people having to live alongside blacks and other non-whites, and have some of the world’s lowest birth rates.
After what white people has done to everyone else in the world through occupations, invasions, slavery, genocide, pogroms, segregation, inquisitions, scientific racism, forced assimilation and many more atrocities, it’s crucial to make them remember what they have done.
And arguments on how ‘it was our ancestors that did it and we shouldn’t have to pay for it’ is the most ridiculous trite ever. Whites must always be reminded of their barbarous and oppressive ways so as to avoid them doing the same things over again. Oh wait, they’re still doing it but it gets manipulated by the media.
It’s a pity that there are people like you. If only whites would learn that the world is not theirs. That their way of life is not universal. That their concepts and ideas of ‘civilization’ is a facade that is self appointed.
Not all white people are evil. There are good ones. It’s too bad the bad apples smell stronger.
Thanks for posting. It’s a shame white privilege is a taboo topic on our campus. Check out Cal, the Claremont Colleges and any Ivy League school, and they’d view the topic as common sense while at USC it’s viewed as extremism or ignorance. Our campus needs to make students more aware of white privilege and privilege in general (ie male privilege, heteronormativity). Thanks for writing, Arya, and I hope soon the Trojan family will realize that CBCSA, El Centro, and APASA, among other centers, aren’t reverse racism. 
For the rest of the folks who commented: If white privilege didn’t exist, having two women of color as Pres/VP wouldn’t be news in 2015, nor would it be the first time for all of the pac 12. If white privilege didn’t exist, neither would the row.
So this article is a parody, right??  Assuming there is such a thing as “white privilege” in 2015, blaming the shooting on it is a sign of pure and absolute ignorance.  The gunman, in this case, is at the very least a hate-monger and quite possibly MENTALLY DERANGED.  While the politicians will continue to use this tragedy to further their agendas, perhaps we, as a civilized society, should start thinking about mental illness and how it is underreported and undertreated.
Because if white people commits a crime they are clearly mental issues. But when it comes to non-whites, nope! Chuck them in as terrorists, rebels, thugs, gangsters, and violent criminals. It’s funny how white people like you would not admit to something that is clearly going on. White privilege or shall we say White American privilege is as plain as day.
The author’s entire argument rests on a glaring category mistake.
If Mike Brown had perpetrated a church massacre, the media would INDEED
have questioned his sanity, and not been much interested in his criminal history. That’s because “thugishness” alone does not explain mass murder. The brutally senseless act  —  regardless of the race of the shooter — suggests only two possible explanations: insanity or terrorism.  
Let’s try a different thought-experiment: Suppose a black cop had gunned down an unarmed Dylann Roof in broad daylight on the streets of Charleston. Would the media have speculated as to whether the white victim was mentally ill? No. That would have been a total non-sequitur. The victim’s personal conduct and criminal history (thugishness), however, is entirely relevant when a police officer is accused of murdering him in cold blood.
you forgot to finish the article- what are the proper steps to achieve full equality?
Roshanian, instead of glossing over “white privilege,” why don’t you expound? You have to convince readers of what you write instead of just throwing something out there and pontificating.

Trojans have started a club to educate students looking to explore the alternative sexuality made popular by the erotic book series Fifty Shades of Grey.
One of the top-selling points of USC is its plethora of student organizations. More than 850 student-run clubs with a wide range of interests such as athletics, culture, academics, arts, politics and community service, hold countless events throughout the year, including general meetings, lectures, workshops, concerts, philanthropy events, rallies and social events, on and off campus, and all are open to any Trojan.
If students’ interests include exploring their sexuality, they might find themselves at an event hosted by the USC BDSM Club, an official USC organization dedicated to helping “kinky” Trojans who want to learn about the BDSM alternative sexuality and encouraging them to practice safely.
BDSM refers to different kinds of erotic practices that involve power dynamics, bondage and role-play, among other activities. The acronym BDSM stands for bondage/discipline, dominance/submission and sadism/masochism. The BDSM lifestyle has recently been thrust into the popular culture spotlight because of the book series — and now film — Fifty Shades of Grey, an erotic romance novel by E. L. James.
The BDSM club at USC, however, is mainly focused on education, safety and exploration of the alternative sexuality via discussions, workshops and seminars.
Cherys Fair, one of the club’s founders, said that the idea for starting the club was born out of her own conversations with co-founder Cooper Surrett.
“[In talking with Cooper], I felt like I had permission to be interested in BDSM,” Fair said. “He’s just a normal college student, but he’s also into these things. It made me realize you can do BDSM and not be a freak.”
They discussed the BDSM lifestyle as freshmen and connected over the fact that there was no outlet for those interested in learning about BDSM at USC.
“We spent a long time connecting over the topic, knowing there was no community at USC,” Surrett said. “Eventually we were at a [Queer and Ally Student Assembly] leadership retreat, and the whole idea was to form new groups with QuASA. We eventually decided it would be great to start a potential member org with QuASA because it kind of fit into the queer lifestyle as an alternative sexuality.”
QuASA is under the jurisdiction of Program Board, a branch of Undergraduate Student Government. QuASA currently has seven member organizations, separate clubs at USC that request to be associated with QuASA because of a shared interest in queer issues at USC.
The BDSM club initially chose to be associated with QuASA because their interest is considered to be an alternative sexuality.
As a QuASA member organization, the club hosted a “BDSM 101” panel, which was attended by about 80 students. The group also hosted events such as a discussion about polyamory, or a relationship consisting of more than two people, and a “Make Your Own Flogger” arts and crafts event.
The club disassociated from QuASA for the 2014-2015 school year to focus more on its mission, according to Surrett and Fair, and has since hosted “The Art of Shibari, a hands-on, over-the-clothes rope tying workshop,” which about 60 students attended. The event, which was mostly advertised on Facebook and via fliers with a poster featuring a cartoon of a tied-up girl, featured a professional instructor and promised a “judgment-free environment” and “friendly knowledgeable people” to any interested Trojans, aged 18 and older.
Other than special events such as the workshop, the club concentrates on bi-weekly meetings, known as “munches,” where students can discuss BDSM, kink and fetishes in a judgment-free safe space over snacks. Seven to 10 students currently attend the discussions regularly.
According to Hannah, a member of the club’s executive board who declined to share her last name because she has not yet told her family of her involvement in BDSM, one of the goals of the USC BDSM club is to overcome the stereotypes associated with the lifestyle.
“A lot of people who find out that I’m affiliated with the club say, ‘You don’t look like that kind of person,’” Hannah said. “But I say, ‘What did you expect?’ My experiences meeting people in the Los Angeles community is that these people are doctors and lawyers and they’re in Hollywood, and they’re normal. They’re not covered in tattoos and piercings and wearing leather. They’re normal people.”
Richard Sprott, executive director of CARAS, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the study of alternative sexualities, said that the stigma surrounding the BDSM lifestyle is still quite prevalent despite BDSM’s recent attention in popular culture.
“There is this belief that somehow people are [practicing BDSM] because of abuse,” Sprott said. “Research that is out there does not find that to be the case. The number of people who are abused and doing BDSM is not different the number of people who are abused in the general population. A lot of people do also hear things sometimes from doctors or psychiatrists that there’s something wrong with them, but the research does not support that.”
According to Sprott, 10 to 15 percent of the population expresses an alternative form of sexuality based on studies conducted over the course of 60 years. BDSM is expressed as a fantasy in approximately 23 percent of the population, and it is expressed as a behavior by 10 percent of the population at some point in their lives.
BDSM means different things to different people though, Sprott said. Some people who participate in BDSM are attracted to the power dynamic, while others crave the intense physical sensations that the body produces in reaction to “impact play,” such as flogging and other types of hitting. Others, he said, have certain fetishes surrounding objects or furniture used in BDSM activities. According to Sprott, for some, BDSM is an erotic activity, but does not necessarily involve or lead to sex, a common public misconception, while others treat BDSM as a precursor to sex.
Though people have been engaging in BDSM activities for years, many keep those activities private to avoid judgment or discrimination. Hannah said she has not discussed her participation in the BDSM lifestyle with her parents or any other family members because she feels that they would not be accepting.
“They’re just not on the same page,” Hannah said.
Fair, however, has told her parents that she is involved in BDSM, but no other family members. She said that her mother was initially concerned because she thought BDSM was a “violent, scary thing,” but has not made efforts to prevent Fair from partaking in the BDSM lifestyle.
“I found it a little bit liberating,” Fair said. “To be a public face of this club means I had to face all of that and come to terms with it when I started it. At this point, I can publicly post anything I want on my Facebook page because there’s no one on there, who’s still on there, who would have issues with it. If someone in my circle was taking issue with [BDSM], I either resolved it for them or said this is a thing that’s important to me and if you can’t stop judging me then you don’t need to be here.”
Fair admits, however, that embracing the lifestyle publicly has been challenging and is sometimes awkward. She said, for example, that she posted fliers around campus to advertise for the club’s rope tying workshop one week before the event, but just a couple days later, all the fliers had been taken down. After posting them again just one day before the event, she found that they had all been removed again by the time the event was over.
Hannah said that in order to avoid criticism and preserve the judgment-free space provided by the club, the executive board does their best to keep club activities relatively private. The club maintains a “secret” group on Facebook that members must be invited to join, along with an anonymous Facebook account, which goes by the pseudonym “Tommy Troj,” that is used to advertise events in student groups on the social network. The account’s profile picture is a photo of Tommy Trojan during Rivalry Week, when the statue is wrapped in duct tape.
“Most of my friends have been accepting, but I know there are certain orgs that I’m part of that I can’t publicize the event to [on Facebook] because I would be judged,” Hannah said. “You have to be careful who you tell.”
This judgment, however, seems to be born out of a lack of understanding about BDSM. Fair and Hannah said that Fifty Shades of Grey has perpetuated many misconceptions about the lifestyle and that members of the BDSM community do not typically endorse the books and film.
Fair said that much of the books’ impact has been seen at community “dungeons,” or commercial establishments where BDSM events are held under supervision of staff. She said that after the film was released, dungeons in L.A. were “packed.”
“But people were like, ‘We don’t want these fan girl idiots in here,’” she said.
Hannah said much of the backlash against the books comes from their inaccurate representation of BDSM.
“It definitely promotes certain abusive tendencies,” Hannah said.
Sprott recommends that anyone who is curious about BDSM talk to others involved in the lifestyle and go to classes to learn more.
“The most important thing when it comes to these activities is learning to do them safely,” Sprott said. “This is where having a group can provide some added protection. Generally in my experience the people who don’t have a community have more accidents and get into more trouble.”
Fair agreed that having a place to learn about ways to safely practice BDSM, in addition to learning about communication and consent, is vital to being part of the community.
“You really have trust someone and know them and talk to them before you feel good about playing with them. A lot of communication is involved,” Fair said.
Fair, Surrett and Hannah have many plans to expand the club’s activities. The three hope to organize programing with a counterpart organization at UCLA and involve the club more in Los Angeles’ active BDSM community through mentoring from older members. They also plan to host more events, including a first aid tutorial, a workshop about spanking and another rope tying and bondage seminar; discussions about transgender identity; and more interactive munches in which club members will lead their own discussions.
“If someone finds out that you [like BDSM] and thinks, ‘You don’t look like the kind of person that would do that’ — that’s the point,” Fair said. “It’s something that normal people do and like.”

A team of four students took home first place in this year’s Saving Water Futurethon event with “Terracotta,” a website aimed at helping homeowners design and create their own eco-friendly lawn.
The 48-hour event, hosted by USC, Deutsch, Hack for L.A., the City of Los Angeles and Global Shapers, was held June 6-7.  Thirty students from USC came together with 30 professionals to discover new and innovative ways to deal with the California drought, which is now entering its fourth year.
Spring graduates Camille Kanengiser, Max Pittsley and Catherine Chooljian, along with 2014 graduate Mehrdad Mahdavi, made up the team responsible for the prize-winning website design.
“We had a very diverse team with Camille and Catherine coming from the art side and Mehrdad coming from the engineering side and myself having business experience,” Pittsley said. “That really made it easy to partition the duties.”
Using supplementary information from Google Maps, Terracotta formulates a visual model of a lawn design based on soil type and the elevation of the home along with the various aesthetic wishes of the user.
“With the drought, there’s so much research that a person has to do that no one has time for,” Pittsley said. “We spent a 48-hour weekend working with some of the top experts in the field, and we feel like we just barely scratched the surface. The idea is to make that information accessible to everyone.”
Two of the experts that the team worked closely with are Claire Latane and Margot Jacobs of Mia Lehrer + Associates. The two inspired the team to create the website due to the spread of misinformation about what constitutes an eco-friendly lawn.
“Talking to them was great because they mentioned how people who rip out their lawns and place native plants weren’t actually solving the problem — just diverting it into another problem,” Kanengiser said. “Grass serves a purpose but there are different types of grass that will save people in the long run and still be aesthetically pleasing.”
Homeowners who pulled out their lawns without replacing it with another form of foliage could contribute to “urban island heating effect” as grass has a natural ability to act as a light reflection device.
“Urban heating occurs when light that isn’t used by plants for energy are not reflected back up,” Kanengiser said. “It heats up urban environments.”
Kanengiser and Pittsley, who have worked together on “ElemenTerra,” a virtual reality game, said their interactive media background played a large role in the way their team decided to inform homeowners. The design for Terracotta’s website was influenced by game design principles that focused on usability and entertainment as an educational tool.
“Considering things from the player’s perspective — motivation and ease of use and iteration — all of that was really core to the way that we went about building our design,” Pittsley said.
Kanengiser and Pittsley both expressed concern over the fact that information about the drought, though readily available, was difficult for people to obtain.
“There is a lot of information from a lot of sources,” Kanengiser said. “Most people simply don’t have the time and energy to go through all of it. If you’re working more than one job or are a student or perhaps raising a family, it simply won’t happen.”
Pittsley said that this was the key problem they planned to address with their design.
“That’s why we wanted to make Terracotta interactive,” Pittsley added. “We’re trying to make things more specific and topical.”
With their first prize win, the four students have received summer fellowship opportunities to continue work on their project at USC. In addition, Pittsley and Kanengiser offered advice to students who are interested in joining the fight against water waste.
“Be knowledgeable. Get involved. And be creative with it,” Kanengiser said. “If someone has a really fun, creative idea and needs a developer or artist, USC is a great place to find those resources to make it happen. There are mentors and teachers that are eager to help.”

A university van used by the Spirit of Troy marching band caught fire on Saturday night outside Stonier Hall, leaving at least one person injured. The incident is still under investigation by the Los Angeles Fire Department.
According to USC Dept. of Public Safety Deputy Chief Johnnie Adams, the investigation has been taken over by the LAFD Arson Unit. From pictures taken at the scene, Adams said that the white university van appears to be totaled, with the interior being fully gutted and the exterior suffering damage as well.
Adams also said that a suspect of interest was taken from the scene to a local hospital after suffering burns.
“He was taken in that evening,” Adams said. “It is unknown if he was taken into formal custody or not.”
According to LAFD spokesman Erik Scott, a 911 call was received at 10:06 p.m. and once the firefighters arrived on scene they were able to completely extinguish the fire.
Scott said the incident was still under investigation and could not comment on whether there are any suspects, citing it as a police matter.

Legendary animator Eric Goldberg, best known for films such as Aladdin and Pocahontas, will join the John C. Hench Animation Division of Animation and Digital Arts of the School of Cinematic Arts this fall.
The appointment was announced June 16 by the SCA.
Goldberg has had a long career in animation, working at both Warner Brothers and the Walt Disney Company on numerous projects including Pocahontas, Hercules and Looney Tunes: Back in Action.
Tom Sito, chair of the John C. Hench division, worked closely with Goldberg on many projects and expressed his excitement over having Goldberg join the SCA faculty.
“He is one of the greatest animators in the world today. A constant professional,” Sito said. “[He was] a protégé for numerous legendary animators like Chuck Jones.”
When Goldberg was 4 years old, he began drawing pictures of cartoons such as Wile E. Coyote, and it wasn’t long until he started making flipbooks. By 13, he was making his own home-made animated films.
Goldberg was heavily influenced and inspired by Disney films growing up, with special appreciation for Dumbo and Fantasia. He admired the experimental animation of both films as well as the unlikely protagonist of Dumbo. His love of experimentation would reflect in his later work when he got the chance to direct two sequences in Fantasia 2000: “Carnival of the Animals” and “Rhapsody in Blue.”
As a student at the Pratt Institute, Goldberg met and began working with Richard Williams, art director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, who he said taught him “the craft of animation” and would give him his first chance to work on a production in the form of the animated feature, Raggedy Ann & Andy.
More than a decade later, Goldberg started at Disney. Within two years, he was given the opportunity to design one of the most memorable characters in Disney history – the Genie from Aladdin. Goldberg co-directed Pocahontas shortly after, in 1995.
Sito, who worked as the head of the storyboard department for Pocahontas, noticed particular traits about Goldberg that made him stand out among other animators.
“What I’ve always found amazing with Eric is that he would watch a film moving at normal speed and tell you who animated what scene,” Sito said. “Not only for the stuff that we worked on, but even classic cartoons like Tom and Jerry or Bugs Bunny from the 1940s. It’s scary.”
Teaching will not be a new endeavor for Goldberg either.
“Eric was working at other organizations off and on but not frequently because he is still full time at Disney,” Sito said. “But I know for the quality of education he brings, he deserves a world class environment like SCA where [students] can fully appreciate what he has to teach.”
Students are also excited for the chance to be under Goldberg’s tutelage.
“I’m thrilled that Eric Goldberg is coming to USC,” Samantha Vilfort, a junior majoring in animation, said. “He’s an insanely gifted animator, an absolute legend in the industry, and I can’t wait to see how he’s going to inspire the SCA ‘animajors.’”
Troy Peterson, a class of 2017 critical studies student with a passion for animation history, also expressed excitement over his arrival.
“I wish I could take one of his classes because he always talked about animation history with so much respect and knowledge,” Peterson said. “I grew up watching him talk about animation history and clearly he has the passion for it. [SCA animation students] are really going to learn a lot from him.”
For the fall semester, Goldberg will teach CTAN 577a, a graduate-level animation fundamentals course at SCA. In addition, he plans to continue working at Disney.
