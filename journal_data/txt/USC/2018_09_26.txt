Independent pop act Superorganism had a very intriguing start.  Led by vocalist, Orono Noguchi, Christopher Young, Tim Shann, Blair Everson, Mark Turner, Ruby, B, and Soul — who come from different countries — originally started working together without having met. Ringing true with its futuristic, electronic sound, Superorganism’s formation is a testament to the power of music in the digital age. The seven-person group  would send audio files back and forth and piece together the recordings — the tactic utilized for their viral hit, “Something For Your M.I.N.D.” The success of the track led them to meet and form the group, eventually releasing animpressive debut album this summer and embarking on a world tour. 
On Saturday, Sept. 22, the eight-member group played a live show in support of their eponymous record  at the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood. 
Clocking in on time, Superorganism showcased the best tracks of its underrated and criminally overlooked debut album. The performance was both thrilling and confusing, and it transported the audience to the interesting, unexplored facet of Superorganism’s psyche.
The show opened with choppy video game-inspired visuals accompanied by an intense, pulsating instrumental. After the introductory visual concluded, the band wasted no time in opening their performance with “SPRORGNSM.” The band, led by Noguchi, remained mostly still throughout the performance. Noguchi’s angsty and jaded attitude was simultaneously overbearing and highly entertaining. While his persona may have turned off some members of the audience, certain fans felt even more connected to the singer.
The entire show was informal in delivery, with the backing vocalists seeming to be the only members with a rehearsed choreography. The technical aspects of the show were the most thrilling aspect of the show, with the instrumentation and vocals sounding nearly identical to the studio recordings. The visuals further emphasized the psychedelic nature of their sound. 
Midway through the performance, Noguchi stopped the show to field audience questions. Spanning from the banal to the overly intrusive, the questions were a jarring and unnecessary addition to the show. Noguchi answered her favorite flavor of pizza, her biggest fears and other questions as bizarre as the rest of the show. While somewhat funny, the segment could’ve easily been cut from the set. 
The weirdest portion of the show was the performance of “Prawn Song,”which was accompanied with images of shellfish, wormholes, and other digitally enhanced images. As the show forged on, Noguchi invited members of the crowd to join her and the rest of the band to dance on stage. They ended the show with “Relax,” during which fans flooded the stage to dance with the band. It was not until the encore when the band performed their breakout hit “Something For Your M.I.N.D.” 
Superorganism has an extremely unique sound that exists largely within the millennial-targeted digital world of contemporary music. Noguchi’s “over-it” attitude may be too much for those looking for a spectacle, but the lazy vocal delivery was as intentional any other aspect of the performance. With its unique and bizarre live performances, Superorganism has the potential to become an even bigger act in the coming months.

Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said the committee hopes to find the next president in four to six months, but that they will take the amount of time they need. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
During a night filled with emotion and frustration, the Presidential Search Advisory Committee hosted its third listening session at Town & Gown on Tuesday evening. The event featured a platform for faculty, staff, students and alumni to speak on issues and concerns regarding USC’s search for the next president.
“I just want to remind everybody, just because I find it fascinating, factually, that this is only the 12th time since 1880 that we’ve had the opportunity to conduct a presidential search,” said Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso. “This is a historic moment … it’s monumental and it’s obviously consequential … We are here to listen.” 
Caruso said the committee hopes to find the next president within four to six months, but that the committee will take as much time as they need.
Jeremy Kagan, a professor at the School of Cinematic Arts, was the first to speak. He called the University’s efforts for sustainability embarrassing. 
“I’m hoping that when you interview the various people who are candidates for president, you will make sure the issue of sustainability is primary in their lives,” Kagan said.
Olivia Pearson, a co-director of the Environmental Student Assembly, added that sustainability efforts have only been student- and faculty-driven. 
“The University should provide resources that foster sustainability as a value in its students … instead of growing attitudes of indifference toward sustainability, that are currently being developed at this affluent University,” Pearson said. “We show little regard for how we treat our resources.”
In addition to speakers discussing what on- and off-campus issues that they hope the next administration will address, many shared their visions for what kind of leader the next president should be.
Dana Coyle, an alumna and staff member, whose three children also attended USC, said that the new president should be “authentic, compassionate and candid with all stakeholders.” 
“I encourage the new president to be visible and accessible to the students,” she said.
During the session, the most reiterated topic was the lack of student representation on the search committee. 
Michael Nguyen, a graduate student at the Price School of Public Policy, questioned USC’s commitment to power sharing and asked why there is no student representation on the committee.
“If we assume that the purpose of events like this, and other outreach events, [are] to gather data and to inform decision making to create better outcomes, then perhaps a mechanism to do that is to institutionalize more roles for students within governance,” he said.Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Michaela Murphy expressed her frustration with the Board of Trustees and the lack of student representation and transparency during the search process. 
“To be perfectly candid, these listening sessions have done less than scrape the bottom of the barrel,” Murphy said. “When students are asked to take a leap of faith and trust the judgment of this administration, I’d like you all to meet me halfway … Stop wasting this opportunity to collaborate so positively and so beneficially with the students.”
Former USG official Mai Mizuno echoed that statement.
“It’s becoming harder and harder to say ‘fight on’ when I see students being told to give up our fight,” Mizuno said.

Vargas spoke about the importance of visibility and representation to empower immigrant communities in the United States.(Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
“We can only be alive if we inspire each other,” Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas told the audience Tuesday night at Bovard Auditorium.
Vargas conversed with professor Viet Thanh Nguyen about his newest book “Dear America: Notes of an Undocumented Citizen,” a memoir regarding Vargas’ experience as an undocumented immigrant in America. 
Vargas founded Define American, a nonprofit organization that fights anti-immigrant hate through powerful narratives. Vargas started the conversation by discussing his emigration from the Philippines to the United States in 1993. After his arrival, he said race became his biggest source of confusion. 
“I thought I was in the wrong country,” Vargas said. “When I landed in LAX, I saw people who looked like me, and saw all these people [who] were ‘Latinos.’”
Vargas explained he didn’t learn about his immigration status until he turned 16, after going to the DMV to get his driver’s license. He was told that his green card was fake by a DMV employee. Confused, he confronted his grandfather, who would later tell him that he was undocumented.
“His plan was [that] I would work at the flea market as a janitor, and I would marry a woman, a U.S. citizen,” said Vargas, who also identifies as gay. “That was when the lying started.”
Vargas said he was introduced to journalism by an English teacher. His plan was to get his name in a newspaper and admitted that that was the only reason he became a journalist.
“I figured, if I could write perfect English and speak perfect English … how could they question my natural physicality?” Vargas said.
He decided to stop hiding seven years ago, when he outed himself as undocumented in a New York Times Magazine article, against the advice from many lawyers. His goal was to start a conversation on immigration. 
“If you want me deported, speak now,” Vargas said, drawing laughter from the crowd. 
After the 2016 election, Vargas was asked to move out by his apartment manager. He said he  didn’t have a permanent address while writing his book and that the longest parts of the book were written during airplane rides.
Vargas also emphasized the importance of visibility and representation to empower immigrant communities, and promoted Define American as a tool to spread visibility.
“I’m not taking away what is yours,” Vargas said. “Too often, unfortunately, we don’t want to have conversations anymore. We just want to react to each other.”
Through his book, Vargas hopes to address the emotional consequences of undocumented immigrants’ relationship with the government. Nguyen added that it is damaging to not be seen and recognized. Vargas echoed Nguyen’s sentiment, but said he felt powerful because it openly defined his existence.
“We are enough,” Vargas said. “I actually don’t need papers and a law … to make me feel like I’m enough.” 
To end the event, Vargas asked the audience to sing “Happy Birthday” over the phone to his mother, who turned 61 years old on Tuesday.

At Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting, the Senate led an open discussion regarding the recent bylaw amendment to USG’s diversity fund, which is currently being authored by Sen. Michaela Murphy and former USG official Mai Mizuno. 
Before the discussion, co-Chief Diversity Officer Milton Dimas spoke about a solidarity march this Thursday and how it was happening due to the “many, many problems in this institution” and the country at large. 
Dimas concluded his speech by addressing an upcoming event featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. He called Shapiro’s rhetoric “hate speech” and “bigotry,” and affirmed the student body’s right to speak out. 
“Many of us are unhappy about [Shapiro’s speech], and I understand,” Dimas said. “I don’t think that we should remain silent during this time. I believe we should very much be using our resources and the people we know in order to bring about this change.” 
Regarding the diversity fund, Sen. Shayan Kohanteb addressed Dimas’ comments on Shapiro’s event, which received funding from USG. Kohanteb said that USG funds should not be used for political groups. 
His point prompted a discussion about whether or not cultural organizations and the issues they promote can be depoliticized. 
Sen. Max Geschwind said that he had no problem with political groups receiving funding as long as the process is “fair and equal.” He referenced groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine and Trojans for Israel, who he says should receive an equal share of the diversity fund. 
Several members of the audience expressed their opinions that the interests of cultural organizations are inherently political, and that diminishing their political nature would devalue the organizations’ purposes.
Rosa Wang, executive co-director of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, defended the inherently political nature of their organization. She and others also referred to Shapiro’s views as hateful. Wang went on to call the use of a student-funded account for the event as “blasphemy.”
“I never asked to be marginalized,” Wang said. “The people who attribute those values to me have made my body political, have made me have to fight for myself, fight for my existence.”

Nearly 500 students registered to vote as a part of National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday. The event is part of an ongoing competition between USC and UCLA to register the most voters. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
Nearly 500 USC students registered to vote on National Voter Registration Day Tuesday in front of Tommy Trojan. 
The event — hosted by the Unruh Institute of Politics and VoteSC —  featured free In-N-Out burgers for over 350 students who pledged to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. Nearly 20 student organizations, including the College Democrats and College Republicans, supported the event by using TurboVote to register students for the midterm elections.
“We’re really just trying to make sure that, in addition to using the platform [to register voters], there’s that social consciousness on campus so that everyone knows everyone else is voting and hopefully that starts a chain reaction,” said Alec Vandenberg, director of external affairs for Undergraduate Student Government. 
Briana Miles, director of the Political Student Assembly, said that TurboVote helped register students from every state by instructing them on how to obtain absentee ballots and sending election reminders. 
“It’s a less intimidating process for students because … we have students that are out of state, and we can’t just hand them a paper ballot,” Miles said. “[For] a lot of states you can’t register online, so it’s been really easy to give them that information and that resource without having to personally know all the rules and all the restrictions [in] all 50 states.”
Tuesday’s pledge and registration event are part of an ongoing competition with UCLA’s Voter Coalition to see which campus can register the most students by Oct. 22, the deadline to register voters in California. 
At the previous competition in 2016, UCLA scraped USC by registering over 10,000 voters compared to USC’s 411.
“I feel like USC, compared to other schools, isn’t as politically engaged,” said Neal Sivadas, a civic engagement intern for PSA. “So I really took this opportunity … to really get out here and really try to get people to register to vote because it’s such an important part of democracy.”
While National Voter Registration Day was VoteSC’s “cornerstone event” to register student voters, VoteSC will continue to table on Trousdale Parkway on Mondays to answer student questions about the voter midterms, register voters and provide reminders about the upcoming election. 
Pallavi Yennapu, director of marketing for PSA, said that events like the voter registration drive get more students interested in registering to vote. She encourages students to vote and hopes they realize they have a voice in the political process. 
“It’s really easy to feel that your vote isn’t going to matter,” Yennapu said. “I think giving people access and giving them information and recognizing that one simple action can make a difference and one vote can be important.”

Sophomore defender Jessica Haidet is one of the leaders of USC’s solid back line this season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The No. 2 women’s soccer team will embark on its biggest challenge of the season as the Trojans travel north to face Cal on Thursday and No. 1 Stanford on Sunday.
After shutting out Washington 3-0 over the weekend, the Trojans remain undefeated this season with a record of 8-0-1. Throughout the season, USC has dominated its opponents in almost every matchup. 
The Trojans have won games by controlling possession within the midfield, and creating opportunities for their forwards to pounce. Besides Florida State, other teams haven’t been able to maintain any kind of quality possession against the Trojan midfield. Moreover, when they do get any kind of possession, they have had a hard time getting past the Trojans’ backline. The center-back pairing of senior Ally Prisock and sophomore Jessica Haidet has been posing challenges to their opponents. 
USC takes on the Golden Bears on Thursday at noon. With a record of 4-4-1, Cal hasn’t had quite the same success as Stanford or USC this season; however, the Bears should not be overlooked — especially on the road. 
“Any time you go on the road in the Pac-12 it’s difficult. But Cal is a very good team with the ball,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “They can pass, they can move, they are very smart with the way they move the ball. We’re going to have to be defensively very, very organized.” 
McAlpine noted the Bears inconsistent performances, but he commended their passing game as one of the best in the conference. He stressed the importance of the Trojans playing their game and focusing on themselves to pull off the win.
On Sunday, the Trojans will play Stanford at 1 p.m. Like the Trojans, the Cardinal stand undefeated on the year with a record of 8-0-1. The last time the Cardinal lost a match was in August 2017 to Florida, and they have gone 31 games undefeated since. However, both teams possess a winning mentality, having been the past two winners of the NCAA tournament. 
“Stanford [is] No. 1 for a reason,” McAlpine said. “They are going to be a difficult team to play. They’ve got so many [attacking personalities]. They’ve had some injuries so they are trying to figure some things out again and reorganize, but they are talent rich. [This will be] another benchmark game for us to see where we are as we press towards the end of the season.” 
This game will be all about which team can take advantage of opportunities, since both teams are solid defensively with talented midfield players. 
“There are going to be few chances in the game for both teams,” McAlpine said. “Both teams are good through the midfield. Both teams have good personalities, but it’s those composure moments in the box where there’s defending or attacking that are going to be the difference.” 
With two talented teams, this match appears to be one of the best games of the whole NCAA season.

Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns tallied 64 yards on seven receptions against Washington State. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
Following an impressive comeback win against Washington State, USC now focuses its attention on containing the dynamic ground game of Arizona, led by junior quarterback Khalil Tate and sophomore running back J.J. Taylor. 
The team emphasized the importance of its pass-rush as well as how to keep the quarterback in the pocket, a necessity against a mobile play caller like Tate. With senior captain and offensive lineman Porter Gustin still limited with a knee injury, as well as its depleted secondary due to multiple injuries and the undisclosed absence of sophomore safety Bubba Bolden, the defense has been struggling to develop any sort of chemistry, as indicated by the 73 points they have allowed over the previous two games. For now, the offense remains the Trojans’ focal point. 
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels didn’t seem fazed by the noise from the media and critics following his best performance yet, throwing for 241 yards and three touchdowns. His throwing motion looked fluid, a relief to Trojan fans who were concerned about his right hand injury scare against Texas the prior week. The rest of the offense was moving with a rejuvenated sense of confidence as well, following its season-high five-touchdown performance as well as head coach Clay Helton’s clear vote of confidence in them when he elected to receive the ball first at the start of the game.
“We said in our last team meeting, I said ‘Guys, we’re gonna take the ball,’” Helton said. “We talked all week about starting fast. I believe in the offense, I believe this is going to be a breakout game for you. We’re gonna establish the run early, and they did.”
Helton made sure to highlight Daniels’ improvement and development, rather than isolating one game.
“I can feel it. I actually talked to [redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler] Vaughns when we were at practice and said, ‘Man, you can feel the chemistry start to come with JT and the wideouts,’” Helton said. “He had it with [freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown], but it took a couple weeks to really kind of feel them out, but you could feel it in practice last week … It carried over to the game.”
Helton was especially proud of his team’s resilience and composure under pressure.
“We had said it was [going to] be a four quarter battle,” Helton said. “There was no part about it. We wanted to start fast and finish strong. We felt like if we could win the first and fourth quarter, that we’d win the game. I never saw any panic. They were like, alright, let’s cut this to a one score game, we did, and then the defense started to click in.”
Looking ahead to Arizona on Saturday evening, Helton made it clear that it is a must-win game against a conference rival.
“Really important game for us,” Helton said. “Not only a road game, but when you talk about Pac-12 South games, it’s so important that you make your Pac-12 South wins. The last two times we went to the Pac-12 championship, we had to run the tables in the Pac-12 South … You know you control your own destiny by getting those wins.”
Arizona is currently in first place in the Pac-12 South at 1-0, though most other teams have yet to play a conference game. The Trojans’ next four games are all against conference opponents, with Colorado, Utah and Arizona State looming in the near future. All four games are critical, should USC make a push for a repeat Pac-12 championship appearance and a New Year’s Six bowl game. If Daniels’ and the offense keeps their positive trend up, USC might be able to salvage what seemed like a lost season just last week.
JT to TV 
After catching seven passes for 64 yards and a score, Vaughns spoke about his blossoming connection with Daniels and how no one was ever worried that St. Brown would be Daniels’ only go-to target.
“Like I said before, it was [going to] go slow, it’s a new quarterback, we didn’t have too many rotations in the fall camp,” Vaughns said. “As the game’s going, that’s how we get to know each other more … He only really had one connection; that was [St. Brown], we all knew that going in, so we just had to get on the same page as both of them.”
Vaughns also emphasized the importance of establishing trust through communication between him and Daniels.
“I [have to] be on the same timing as him,” Vaughns  said. “I [have to] go back to the sideline, tell him what I saw, [have to] see what he saw, and we just [have to] marry up at that point.” 
Daniels concurred with Vaughns.
“There’s a lot of things we’re getting better [at] as an offense and as a whole,” Daniels said. “We’re real close to some timing things. We’ll be connecting on a lot more soon, but I think we’re going in a positive direction.”
Injury Update
Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele sat out practice with a sickness. He is expected to return tomorrow.
Gustin was limited as a precautionary measure due to his knee injury.
Sophomore offensive guard Andrew Vorhees was limited with a sternum contusion. 
St. Brown was limited with an AC shoulder sprain.

There’s a common adage in college and professional football — “If you have two quarterbacks, you don’t have one.”
College football’s elite clearly beg to differ.
When looking at the AP Top-25 standings, the top three teams aren’t especially surprising. Alabama,  Georgia and Clemson all reached the College Football Playoff last season, and all three look geared to make return trips. They’ve destroyed opponents by a combined score of 556-165 in 2018.
However, there is something odd happening at the sport’s most important position. Each of the top three teams employ some version of a two-quarterback system, and others should follow.
It seemed like a fad early in the season. After all, it’s common for quarterback competitions to spill over into early-season cupcake games.
But we’re now four games into the 2018 season and the top three teams are still using multiple quarterbacks. Somewhere, football traditionalists are losing their freaking minds.
At Alabama, the Tide is rolling with sophomore phenom Tua Tagovailoa and decorated junior Jalen Hurts. The team’s savior in last year’s National Championship triumph, Tagovailoa has taken the bulk of snaps at signal caller, becoming a Heisman frontrunner in the process.
With the scrambling ability of former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel and the precision of  Katniss Everdeen, Tagovailoa is expected to reign as the unquestioned starter. But his backup is far from a slouch. Hurts led Alabama to two national championships in his first two seasons as starter, earning SEC Offensive Player of the Year honors as a true freshman. He’s played often this season and will continue to be a contributor due to his running ability.
At Clemson and Georgia, the situations are slightly different. Clemson uses the purest form of a two-quarterback offense, sprinkling in freshman Trevor Lawrence and incumbent Kelly Bryant based on the situation (Lawrence was named the official starter on Monday, but Bryant is sure to keep playing).
Seventy miles south, sophomore Jake Fromm is entrenched as Georgia’s starter after leading the Bulldogs to a 12-2 finish in 2017. But a tantalizing freshman, Justin Fields, looms in the background. The Cam Newton-esque prospect is completing 82 percent of his passes and averaging almost nine yards per carry.
What started as an oddity is now strategy for the nation’s preeminent teams — and it’s obviously working. So where is this all heading?
In today’s college football landscape, backup quarterbacks transfer more than Viterbi students do to Marshall. And it makes sense. Most Division I quarterbacks dream of competing on Sundays, and they can’t get there by sitting on a bench. Keeping quarterbacks happy is a challenge, especially since only one can play at a time, unlike a wide receiver or linebacker.
But under new rules, players can now redshirt after playing in up to four games. This makes it more feasible than ever for teams to retain reserve quarterbacks. For instance, Georgia could shut down Fields for the remainder of the season and preserve a year of eligibility — after he’s already gotten valuable reps.
Two-quarterback systems also make sense from a health perspective. Quarterbacks take a pounding in college football, just like they do in the NFL. Just look at the 11 sacks USC freshman quarterback JT Daniels has taken so far. By splitting time, college quarterbacks can minimize risk of injury and potentially prolong their professional careers.
Of course, most teams don’t carry enough depth to utilize two quarterbacks. At USC, Daniels became just the second true freshman in school history to start in the season opener. It’s an impressive feat, sure, but it’s not like he had the stiffest competition. The Trojans’ other quarterbacks name them had a combined nine career pass attempts before this season, and no player was overly impressive in camp. Most schools don’t have the luxury of playing two quarterbacks like Clemson, Georgia and Alabama do.
It’s hard to determine whether two-quarterback systems are here to stay. But with the new redshirt rule and increased concerns about player safety, the nation’s top teams are taking steps in the right direction.
Here are a couple things I enjoyed in sports this week:
USC gets back in the win column
It wasn’t pretty, but USC managed to eke out a victory over Washington State thanks to a blocked field goal by freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele. The defense gave up three fourth-down conversions and mounted little pressure aside from senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin’s lone sack. Yet there are plenty of positive takeaways from Friday night. Daniels avoided turnovers and completed a trio of tight-window touchdown passes. Sophomore running back Vavae Malepai displayed his knack for reaching the end-zone, adding a pair of touchdown runs. My main complaint? Give sophomore running back Stephen Carr the rock more! He’s averaging 5.9 yards per carry on just 33 attempts. 
USC women’s soccer keeps rolling 
They say, “Saturdays are for the boys,” but this Saturday belonged to the women’s soccer team. The team opened conference play against a tough Washington team and won 3-0, with three different Trojans scoring goals. At 8-0-1, USC looks poised to make another deep run in the NCAA Tournament. Women’s soccer is currently the best team at USC (on land), and it’s not particularly close.

Violinist Pamela Frank and physical therapist Howard Nelson are both well acquainted with pain, which they spoke about in tandem on Monday, Sept. 24, at their “Fit as a Fiddle” wellness workshop on in the lower level of The Music Complex. Monday’s discussion featured Frank’s journey through muscle injury that she corrected not through invasive surgery, but through collaboration with Nelson, who specializes in body positioning and movement to correct patients’ muscular strain.
Recalling her performance at the Library of Congress in 2012, Pamela laid bare her history with muscle pain and performance. 
“It sounded good,” Frank said. “But I could not move. I couldn’t feel my whole left side” through the rush of adrenaline, and “it took me two years to recover.” Posture, flexibility and spatial awareness, Nelson said, all contribute to one’s ability to use their muscles with precision and alignment. 
“If you have pain coming down out of … your neck,” he said, “it has to have an opening, and that’s the space between two vertebrae.” Pointing out the loosely rounded structure of the spine, Nelson said, “If you violate those curves excessively, repeatedly, for long periods of time, there’s a chance that your disks will be bothered.”
“If you keep your head and spine in neutral, everything else moves instead” Frank added.
When asked how to combat habits that lead to injury, Frank said, “Divorce your body from your music-making. And by that I mean your… emotions and your passion and your excitement. It’s not your body that’s making the music inside of you, it’s… the rhythm, the meter, the key.”
In her case, Frank needed to “re-learn how to walk” in order to feel the full effects of her improved posture. She raised her arms when waiting in line at the grocery store or otherwise occupied so that she could work against the shoulders’ downward slope established during long hours of violin practice. 
During the course of 2012-2014, Nelson helped Frank develop her serratus anterior muscles, which bring the arms above the skull, away from their resting position. Muscles that are used more often than others move in a way that compensates those that are not used as often. Stretching the serratus reduces tension in the shoulders, Nelson said, because “a muscle will get longer if you constantly stretch it… so we develop knots in this area” to prevent overextension.  These knots further contribute to muscle damage over time.
“I basically live up here” Frank said, elbows out and hands placed squarely on her head.
Kevin Hsu, 26, who is working on his second year graduate certificate, said that his “body is physically involved” when he plays the viola, and he volunteered for a demo after the discussion where the speakers illustrated how Thornton School of Music students and aspiring musicians can use the camera on their phone or computer to determine problems in positioning and corporal alignment.
Other ways to improve performance listed in the event handout included taking breaks every 20-30 minutes during practice to avoid accumulation of tension in the shoulders and other areas, keeping one’s feet on the floor when sitting and using the lightest case possible to avoid unnecessary strain when transporting instruments.
“We all power through (pain),” Pamela Frank said, asking her audience not to mistake playing through bodily discomfort for perseverance. The violinist noted that students should seek professional help before injuries progress and complications worsen. Adding to this, Howard Nelson, quoting to the words of Allan Fox, an inspirational writer and former tennis player, said, “Embrace risk as one of the exciting parts of play,” whether that means learning a new fingering or changing one’s gait. “You’ll be less prone to missing,” Nelson concluded. “And have fun.”
USC has a medical hotline for performers who are experiencing pain, and healthcare by the Center for Performing Arts Medicine at the USC Department of Orthopaedic Surgery is provided under student insurance. This service can be accessed by calling (213) 821-6950, and further injury can be prevented by communicating with teachers and staff on campus.

On Monday night, USC Thornton School of Music’s jazz students brought life to original compositions during “Jazz Night” at the Carson Center.
Held in a black box theater, the “Jazz Honors Combo” is a three-hour concert comprising three unique jazz combos, open to a public audience. Before the show began, the empty seats of the theater began to fill up with those excited to listen to music. 
Alex Knoll, the senior production coordinator for contemporary music at Thornton was involved in hosting the event and explained that “[the Thornton] jazz program acts within the larger contemporary program.” The evening’s concert reflected this, with the honors combo performing a blend of electronic music and traditional jazz.
The event was formatted to showcase three jazz combos featuring everything from traditional swing jazz to experimental jazz.
“The first two combos [consisted of] more traditional swing jazz, but the third combo [was] more experimental,” Reid said. In Reid’s terms, the third combo is more experimental because they are “the honors combo, which is a select group doing their own production of their own pieces.” The production aspect separates the honors combo from the first two because the other combos solely play music which they have written. The honors combo, however, has spent the past two to three weeks working on the music software Logic Pro, honing in their technological production as well as their traditional jazz studies, according to Reid.
As the first two combos played their sets, the difference between the them and the honors combo became apparent. The first combo, referred to as “Edwin Livingston’s First Combo,” were named after the bassist himself played the traditional style of jazz. Consisting of the five classic jazz instruments – piano, bass, saxophone, guitar, and drums – Livingston’s First Combo played five standard jazz pieces, each with their own personality.
The honors combo, headlined by Jason Goldman, had a different sound altogether. While this combo continued with traditional instruments and a classic swing sound, there was a unique addition to the performance. The honors combo enhanced their self-written music with self-produced computer-generated music production, thus emphasizing the contemporary component of the jazz night.
Because each piece of the night was written by a different performer, there was a sense of pride on the stage. Each player of each combo brought a new sound to the table. Whether it was a slow and thoughtful piece that emphasized the saxophone or a rapid, loud piano-heavy piece, “Jazz Night” helped to showcase the talent found at Thornton.
