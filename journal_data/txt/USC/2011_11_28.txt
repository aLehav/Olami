Logically, junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s pending decision is a no-brainer. Even USC coach Lane Kiffin cannot delude himself with the notion that Barkley has anything left to learn at USC under his tutelage.
“I’m probably not supposed to say this but unless he just wants to do it to be a special Trojan, he ain’t coming back,” Kiffin said. “Who’s playing better than Matt in the country? How do you not draft that kid, knowing the player he is and knowing what the kid is?”
Record setting · USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley threw 39 touchdown passes this season, breaking Matt Leinart’s previous 2003 USC record of 38. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Per NFL rules, NCAA student-athletes can declare for the NFL draft three years after graduating from high school.
As a junior, Barkley meets this minimum condition after posting perhaps the greatest single statistical season of any USC quarterback — without the benefit of a Pac-12 championship rematch against Oregon and an additional bowl game to pad his statistics.
“It’s not a deal where he’s going in the late first [round],” Kiffin said. “He’s every bit ready to go to the NFL.”
Before the season, Kiffin indicated that for Barkley to emerge as an elite quarterback, the junior’s final statistical line should feature 30 or more touchdown passes, fewer than 10 interceptions and a minimum 70 percent completion percentage.
Barkley posted a 39-to-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio while completing 69.1 percent of his passes.
In other words, Barkley shattered Kiffin’s loftiest expectations that were meant mostly to ensure the unquestioned team leader did not become complacent after his successful sophomore campaign.
Entering the season with three new starters on the offensive line and junior Khaled Holmes shifting from guard to center, there was concern as to whether Barkley would have enough time in the pocket to throw before pass rushers bore down on him.
But with his pocket awareness and elusiveness, Barkley was sacked just eight times — a new USC record.
Yet, Barkley, nonetheless, might op to head toward the professional ranks.
“I haven’t given up [on Barkley staying],” Kiffin said. “It’s just going to be a decision … does he want to do something that’s really unique, and he might be the kid to do that. I think 90 percent of kids would not.”
Perhaps the only precedent at USC for an underclassman quarterback as talented and accomplished as Barkley staying for his final year of eligibility is former quarterback Matt Leinart, who stayed for his redshirt senior season in 2005 after winning a BCS National Championship and Heisman Trophy.
Barkley broke Leinart’s single-season school and conference record of 38 passing touchdowns after connecting with sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods for his sixth touchdown during  the 50-0 rout of UCLA.
But for all of Leinart’s impressive accolades, Kiffin maintains the comparison between Barkley and Leinart is not all that instructive because Barkley is a better professional prospect than Leinart was at the same stage of their USC careers.
“Whenever people discuss guys staying and losing money, I think you can’t do that,” Kiffin said. “Nobody said Matt Leinart was going in the top-three picks.”
In the summer 2010, Barkley faced the media once news of the sanctions reverberated across the college football landscape, hoping to communicate USC’s intent to persevere. His leadership earned him the distinction of becoming USC’s first sophomore captain. With all he has sacrificed to navigate USC through its draconian sanctions, there is no question that Barkley deserves to make his decision unencumbered by a belief that he owes USC anything.
“I know it sounds weird, but I look up to Matt Barkley,” Kiffin said.
ONCE AGAIN—-MATT YOU NEED TO REALIZE THAT THESE TREMENDOUS AWARDS THAT ARE VERY LIKELY AWAITING YOU–A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE HEISMAN TROPHY–WILL BE LOST FORVER IF YOU DO NOT REMAIN FOR YOUR LAST YEAR.  HOW COULD YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON THESE PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS?  YOU CANNOT!  I KNOW THAT YOUR HEART IS TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHAT I AM SAYING.  AS ALWAYS, OUR LOVE FOR YOU IS UNCONDITIONAL,  BUT STAY AND YOU WILL LIKELY BECOME THE GREATEST TROJAN OF ALL TIME!  THE GREATEST AS A PLAYER AND A HUMAN BEING!  FIGHT ON FOR OLD SC!
DEAR MATT:  AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE IF YOU DO NOT FINISH OUT YOUR FINAL YEAR YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.  WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE THIS WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ENCOURAGING YOU TO STAY.  ALL THE STARS HAVE BEEN ALIGNED IN YOUR FAVOR–NO MORE RESTRICTIONS FOR THE TEAM, A CURRENT AP RANKING OF NUMBER 5 IN THE NATION, A LIKELY NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP,   A VERY PROBABLE HEISMAN TROPHY FOR YOU, MATT KALIL  IS STAYING TO BLOCK FOR YOU,  AND KNOWING THAT YOU ARE DOI NG THE RIGHT THING AND PLACING SPIRITUAL VALUES AHEAD OF MATERIAL ONES.  BY STAYING YOUR FINAL YEAR YOU WILL GAIN THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF MILLIONS OF FANS THAT WILL ALWAYS HOLD YOU IN THE HIGHEST ESTEEM.   YOU HAVE A GREAT CHANCE TO GO DOWN AS THE GREATEST TROJAN OF ALL TIME–LET THIS SINK IN MATT!!! OF ALL TIME!!!  OUR LOVE FOR YOU  IS UNCONDITIONAL  BUT DO THE RIGHT THING AND MAKE US ALL PROUD.  FIGHT ON!!
Don’t Kiffin’s comments strike anyone else as a blatant attempt to manipulate Barkley?  He has couched Barkley’s decision to go pro as telling the Trojan Nation, “I am NOT a special Trojan, I am NOT the really unique guy you thought I was, I’m the 90% who goes for the money.”   Isn’t Barkley a special Trojan and really unique no matter what he decides?   Is not Kiffin being childishly transparent?
Think about ALL the deadly offensive Trojan weapons next year and Matt Barkley is the ONLY person with the skills and abilities to steer this great Trojan machine. There is no one else Trojan in 2012 that can fully utilize our blitzkrieg receivers and TE’s to their fullest potential on the field. No one else with play making abilities to make something out of nothing and then even know not to do anything in certain plays.
Bet that ALL PAC 12 coaches want and ‘pray” Matt Barkley will leave for The NFL.
From the time of the crushing unfair sanctions, the departing of Coach Carroll, and loss of many players though the free agent rule, this team and program has been horse whipped and spat on with everyone in it feeling like  they’re on ‘damage control” while at the same time scratching for inches to slowly move forward.
Out of that unfair abuse through the great coaching of Lane and Monte Kiffin has risen a scarred and victorious team just now at the brink of complete reassertion.
The  undisputed  reestablishment of The Trojan Nation in The PAC 12 and nationally is within sight and I beleive a great calling that only  Matt Barkley can answer in 2012.
The NFL is not going anywhere. Trust in God for your health and NFL future Matt. College is here and then its not anymore.
With that being said which I am sure is how many Trojan fans feel, whatever you decide should be supported by ALL Trojans for all you have done for this team. I wish the very best for you and whatever you do.
Well said!!
Whether you stay or leave, thank you for everything Matt.
but seriously bro… one more year??? pretty please… =P
I’ll second that.  If MB7 stays one more year, I’ll allow a statue of him be placed right next to me.

It’s easy to get caught thinking that last Saturday’s 50-0 trouncing of UCLA marked the end of USC’s probationary period.
With the win, the team ended a two-year period of bowl ineligibility — a sizable weight off the Trojans’ shoulders. USC can now play for a national championship and be ranked in the BCS, something that hasn’t been allowed since the 2009 season.
But an unfortunate reality remains true: The worst part of the sanctions — the part that USC desperately tried to appeal — has yet to come.
The Trojans will be forced to forfeit 10 scholarships for each of the next three seasons. This means that, rather than having 25 recruited athletes join the football team each season, only 15 will be allowed. In a sport where recruiting is the lifeblood of a team’s prolonged success, this is a punishment rarely seen in such magnitude.
Assuming the current coaching staff remains in place, it’s safe to say the Trojans will continue to bring in high-level talent — just less of it. And with less depth, success will depend more than ever on the Trojan veterans — veterans, luckily, that are now just freshmen.
Worried? Don’t be.
At a time when having youth to carry the team is not just important but vital, USC coach Lane Kiffin has gone above and beyond what anyone could have expected.
The Trojans not only finished this season ranked in the top 10, but they did so while starting seven freshmen. One of them, wide receiver Marqise Lee, recorded 73 catches for 1,143 yards and 11 touchdowns. Three others — Dion Bailey, Lamar Dawson and Hayes Pullard — effectively took over the entire linebacking position, something never before seen at USC. Freshman phenom kicker Andre Heidari converted 15 of 17 field goals this season, along with a 50-for-50 mark on extra points.
But these numbers only tell a portion of the story. Perhaps a greater chunk of the freshman talent lies in wait on the bench, earning a redshirt or having backed up a more experienced starter this season.
First-year linemen Cyrus Hobbi, Aundrey Walker and Cody Temple will be critical pieces as the current offensive line begins to improve over the next two seasons. Redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater and freshman tailback George Farmer, both blessed with freakish speed and athleticism, will also begin to take on increased responsibility within the offense. As was showcased all year, the running back stable remains stocked with freshmen Amir Carlisle and D.J. Morgan waiting in the wings.
And most importantly, there is significant talent at quarterback, ready to fill in for junior quarterback Matt Barkley whenever he decides to leave. True freshmen quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek both bring to the table significant upside.
The list really does go on. Though there remains much to be seen, the Trojans now boast quite possibly the best collection of freshmen in the nation, and arguably the best this university has ever seen.
Coming on the heels of the freshman contributions the Trojans have seen the last two years, which included Barkley and lineman Matt Kalil in 2009 and wideout Robert Woods and cornerback Nickell Robey in 2010, that’s a bold statement, but one that has consistently been supported on the field.
Of course, things don’t always go according to plan. Injuries, grades and lack of commitment have felled promising athletes in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.
But the one way to combat this issue is to do exactly what Kiffin has done — stock up. The seeds have been sown for future success, and with the right amount of cultivating, there is potential for progression even beyond what the current team has done.
It is clear that, for all of the success USC has enjoyed this season, it has in no way already triumphed its looming three-year obstacle. But, as Trojan fans have come to expect as of late, the team has certainly taken a step toward ensuring it will.

The final horn at USC football practices never marked the end of the day for senior fullback Rhett Ellison.
As his teammates trickled off of Howard Jones Field on their way to the showers, Ellison would reliably linger, tirelessly catching extra passes or hitting the blocking sled.
Staying home · Senior fullback Rhett Ellison was among a number of seniors who could have transfered without penalty because of sanctions. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
It was fitting, then, that Ellison was one of the last players off the Coliseum field on Saturday following USC’s season-ending 50-0 victory over UCLA. Savoring his final moments in a USC uniform, Ellison climbed up the ladder to lead the Trojan marching band and USC student section through a rendition of “Conquest” and acknowledged all of his fans and family in attendance before slowly jogging back to the locker room one last time.
“I have been a fan of USC my whole life,” Ellison said. “I just wanted to spend some more time on the field to absorb it all in.”
Ellison and the senior class proved their loyalty to the football program simply by remaining at USC, even after learning in 2010 that NCAA sanctions would render the Trojans ineligible for postseason competition in their final two collegiate seasons.
Further, the NCAA allowed juniors and seniors to transfer and play at their new schools immediately, giving players a free pass to compete at other universities without having to sit out for a season.
Some players, including running back D.J. Shoemate (Connecticut) and defensive lineman Malik Jackson (Tennessee), took advantage of the opportunity to transfer without penalty. Many of the players who remained, however, proved vital to the Trojans’ success this season.
“We all stayed and battled,” said senior wide receiver Brandon Carswell. “This is an awesome way to go out.”
USC will lose 23 seniors, including some redshirt juniors who do not plan on returning in 2012. The Trojans could also have to replace several juniors should they choose to enter the NFL draft.
In his final collegiate game, Ellison caught a three-yard pass from junior quarterback Matt Barkley in the second quarter. He finished the season with 133 receiving yards and two touchdowns.
Senior tailback Marc Tyler recorded 595 rushing yards and four touchdowns this season, and Carswell added 153 receiving yards with a touchdown.
Defensively, senior linebacker Chris Galippo had 47 tackles, 1.5 sacks and one interception on the season. Senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris had 22 tackles, including seven for a loss.
Ellison and senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou represented the Trojans as captains, along with juniors Barkley and safety T.J. McDonald.
“The leadership from the seniors is unlike anything that we have had before,” Barkley said.
The seniors exit USC having gone 4-0 against UCLA; the redshirt seniors went 5-0 against their crosstown rivals.
“To go out having never lost to UCLA is a big deal, something they will remember for the rest of their lives,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin.
The Bruins (6-6, 5-4) will advance to the first-ever Pac-12 Football Championship Game, representing the South division against Oregon on Dec. 2, but the Trojans finished the season with a better record (10-2, 7-2).
“We may not get to play in the Pac-12 championship game, but I guarantee that people will say that we should have been there,” Harris said.
After the game against UCLA, the seniors spoke to their teammates in the locker room, recalling fond memories from their time at USC and passing along words of advice. They struggled to come to terms with the fact that their collegiate careers had ended.
“It has not hit me yet,” Ellison said. “I am still expecting to have to go to meetings [on Sunday] and practice on Monday.”

In the moments leading up to Saturday’s game against then-No. 10 USC, UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel insisted the gap between the two programs had closed.
Battle for L.A. · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee caught 13 passes for 224 yards against the Bruins, giving the Trojans their 25th season of at least 10 wins. Lee was named Pac-12 Co-Offensive Freshman of the Year. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Provided they could upend the Trojans (10-2, 7-2) in the 81st meeting between the two crosstown rivals, the Bruins would find themselves in first place atop the Pac-12 South standings.
“We’ve got a chance to win the championship, that’s closing the gap,” he said. “We didn’t have a chance in years past.”
Though UCLA (6-6, 5-4) will represent the South division Friday in the inaugural Pac-12 championship game against No. 8 Oregon as USC is ineligible for postseason play, it didn’t necessarily look like a squad headed to a conference title game.
In front of an announced sellout crowd at the Coliseum, USC defeated UCLA, 50-0, to maintain the football pecking order in Los Angeles, despite the optimism Neuheisel had generated since returning to Southern California just four years ago.
It was USC’s 12th win in the last 13 meetings against UCLA. It was also the most lopsided matchup between the two rivals since 1930, when USC similarly toppled the Bruins by a score of 52-0.
“It was a pretty strong statement to me,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of Neuheisel’s remarks. “Our players took that very personally.”
The Trojans established their dominance early and did not let up, scoring on their first four possessions of the game en route to a 29-0 halftime lead.
And they scored quickly. Their first scoring drive, capped by a 42-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Matt Barkley to freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, lasted a mere 1:45. USC’s second scoring possession was even shorter — 1:42.
Headlining its offensive attack, in large part, was Barkley, playing in what could prove to be his final game in a cardinal-and-gold uniform. The third-year signal caller tossed six touchdown passes to break the Pac-12 single-season record for touchdowns with 39 — a mark previously held by former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, who threw for 38 in 2003.
“I never thought this would happen,” said Barkley, who also threw for 423 yards, completing 35 of 42 passes. “I remember watching him play that year. I kind of dreamed about something like that, but I never thought it would actually happen.”
Barkley’s offensive showing was aided by the play of his wide receivers, Lee and sophomore Robert Woods, who finished with 224 and 113 receiving yards, respectively, moving each above 1,000 yards on the season, marking just the fourth time in school history a receiving duo has done so.
Woods also broke the single-season Pac-12 record for receptions, finishing with 111 on the season, snapping Keyshawn Johnson’s previously held mark of 102.
“[Woods] was a huge motivation for me,” Lee said. “I knew once I came to ’SC, I would transition all of my energy into football. My teammates and coaches have helped me a lot.”
Though USC’s offense accomplished a number of milestones against the Bruins, its defense, in several respects, was equally as impressive, recording its first shutout since a 56-0 win over Washington on Nov. 1, 2008, and first over the Bruins since 2001.
“We just try not to let anybody score. Period,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “And that’s every game. [Saturday], everything fell our way. It all comes back to finishing.”
The Bruins, though failing to register a point, did have scoring chances, particularly in the early moments.
Trailing 7-0 with less than two minutes into the game, UCLA quarterback Kevin Prince and company fielded the ball at their 20-yard line, before marching 79 yards in just over six minutes to the USC 1-yard line with a chance to score.
Facing a fourth-and-goal and needing a touchdown to knot the score at seven, Neuheisel opted to try and score instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal. But junior safety Jawanza Starling broke through into the backfield and stopped running back Derrick Coleman on a running play that yielded no gain.
Five plays later, junior tailback Curtis McNeal found the end zone on a 73-yard run, giving the Trojans a two-touchdown lead midway into the first quarter. McNeal would finish with 130 rushing yards on 12 carries, giving him 1,005 yards on the season to become USC’s first 1,000-yard rusher since Joe McKnight in 2009.
The win on Saturday marked the Trojans’ 10th of the year, giving the team its 25th double digit-win season.
“To win is one thing, but to win like that is something different altogether,” Kiffin said. “I’m really excited for our fans and our players.”
But even for USC, which finished undefeated in November for the ninth time in the last 10 seasons, outscoring opponents by a combined margin of 170-69, it won’t play in the first-ever Pac-12 championship game on Friday against Oregon, nor will it play in a bowl game — as outlined by NCAA sanctions
“We should be going to play for the Pac-12 title,” Robey said. “But we already understood that we have no control over what happened. Next year, we’ll just have to come out and set the tone early.”
NICE WIN TROJANS!!! Its great to make a joke of Larry’s first PAC 12 titel game. thats what he gets for not supporting us! FIGHT ON, BEAT THE RAINBOW WARRIORS!!!

The artist Cryptik probably couldn’t have chosen a more mysterious name. And his art succeeds in living up to the enigmatic aura his name creates.
Progressive art · Modern artist, Cryptik, a Hold Up Art gallery regular, makes yet another appearance with his latest art show, “Sacred Syllables,” which explores Sanksrit, Hebrew, Arabic and Hindi texts through a variety of media such as silk screen. The show incorporates everyday objects and places them in a rejuvenated, artistic setting. - Photo courtesy of Gorgeous PR
In his new show “Sacred Syllables,” Cryptik showcases an art that is delicate and complex and takes a certain focus to fully appreciate. This artist manages to make bold street art and more foreign, delicate pieces. Taking inspiration from Sanksrit, Hebrew, Arabic, Hindi and Cholo characters, Cryptik has crafted his own version of calligraphy that pervades his art.
Cryptik is no stranger to Hold Up Art gallery, which houses the exhibition. He was one of many participants in the “Hi-Graff” exhibition, which opened last May and was dedicated to street art and included other prominent street art figures such as Cache.
Hold Up frequently welcomes controversial, unique and intriguing art and artists; Cryptik’s work is no exception. But what distinguished him the most was that he took full advantage of the room for “Sacred Syllables,” allowing viewers to walk freely and fully experience his art. The exhibition is only on the first floor of the gallery, but somehow Cryptik packs a lot of works into the small space.
The middle wall is a large rendition of his piece “Cryptik Ghandi,” a mixed media work probably familiar to some street art fanatics. The piece is also fittingly on display on the street across from the newly-built, exotic grill Wurstküche, not too far from the gallery, among works  by Banksy and other street artists.
Inside the gallery, the work is even more stunning as Gandhi’s large face is surrounded not by the work of other street artists but by carefully chosen materials that create a complex background.
On either side of this large work are small stations of sorts, filled with various works created by Cryptik and props, such as bags of leaves and rice, that add to the atmosphere. At first, the scenes are set up to seem as if they were just that—scenes from some sort of foreign film, complete with items like prayer flags and lit candles.
Upon closer inspection, viewers will see that a lot of Cryptik’s works are buried within these intricate settings. This is what sets the exhibition apart from past ones — the viewer has to look closely to find Cryptik’s work but when they do, it’s obvious that much expertise and thought go into every object he makes.
The artist purposefully chooses certain objects in which he prints his trademark calligraphy. For instance, Frames hold a variety of objects, the smallest of which are leaves. Specifically, certain pieces features calligraphy on bodhi leaves, which are central to Buddhism. The way Cryptik arranges the calligraphic characters makes for a mesmerizing visual experience, and this text is even more impressive on such a small, delicate surface. Most of the works are placed in antique frames, giving them an even more intriguing, mysterious quality.
Cryptik’s versatility works to his favor as he manages to show off his skills on a variety of canvases without overwhelming the viewer. The silkscreen print “Copper Ganesha” is a dizzying composition of lines that creates an impressive sense of movement. The background of the piece meshes different elements, but keeps to an admirably simple color palette of white, brown and black.
His “Black and Gold Mantra” calligraphy, made with acrylic on paper, also makes good use of simple color, using black and gold to create an intriguing mix. The colors pop up in other pieces as well, showing that he can take these colors and make them spellbinding when they are paired with flowing, delicate calligraphy in varying sizes.
Cryptik doesn’t just stick to antique-looking aesthetics though. He injects the show with some modernity by placing his art on decks, the flat part of a skateboard, and also creating T-shirts with some of his trademark images. The canvases might seem anachronistic, but the art transfers well and gives the more modern surfaces an exotic twist.
At first glance, Cryptik’s work might seem simple but when you look closely it’s obvious that quite the opposite is true. The calligraphy is exquisitely made, the canvases creatively chosen. “Sacred Syllables” is an exercise in slowing down and really looking at a piece to take in all it has to offer.

Gender issues have become increasingly more prominent in the media.
Gender ambiguity · Laure (Zoé Héran, right) adopts the name and persona of Mikael, an identity with which she better relates, when she moves to a new town. Lisa (Jeanne Disson) welcomes Mikael into her friend group, but remains completely unaware of Mikael’s big secret. - Photo courtesy of Rocket Releasing
Tomboy, a film by director Céline Sciamma, explores just that — a 10-year-old girl’s feelings of confusion and sexual ambiguity in a typically French style.
In Tomboy, a French family with two daughters, 10-year-old Laure (Zoé Héran) and 6-year-old Jeanne (Malonn Lévana), moves to a new suburban neighborhood. With a boyish haircut and tomboy-ish demeanor, Laure passes herself off to the local kids as a boy under the name Mikael. The leader of the pack of children, Lisa (Jeanne Disson), becomes smitten with Mikael, the uniquely attractive boy.
Laure takes advantage of her new identity as Mikael — playing sports with the local boys, acting tough and even entertaining the idea of a girl being interested in her. The end of summer and the start of school promise an end to Laure’s dual identities.
Tomboy is a touching coming-of-age film, and Laure’s struggle to maintain her fake identity is moving and suspenseful. Viewers observe Laure as she struggles with various problems, such as trying to urinate like a boy and converting the feminine clothes her parents give her into more boyish articles. Laure even crafts a fake penis out of clay to put in her swimming trunks so she will look like a boy when swimming with friends. Moments like these show viewers how desperately Laure wants to fit in.
Héran acts her lead role perfectly, full of empathy. Héran gives us an incredibly natural-feeling performance. She is unassuming but still shows emotion through her face and  body. Small, quiet moments provide insight into Laure’s character, such as when Lisa applies makeup to Laure’s face and tells her she would look great as a girl. As she digests these words, Laure is full of repressed emotion — sad, but also gripping. She also slumps in her seat with all the emotion of a child who doesn’t even know who she is.
Laure lives in a world full of confusion — about herself, her feelings and her environment. She is the new kid on the block, and it doesn’t help that her parents are distracted by the impending arrival of a new baby.
Thankfully, Laure’s charming and adorable sister, Jeanne, adds the right amount of comic relief and is the perfect complement to the angst-filled Laure.
With only a handful of scenes in the movie involving adults, a talented cast of kids helps make Tomboy feel raw and believable. The more emotionally intense scenes feel extremely realistic — the children talk minimally and awkwardly, and the conversations are full of uncomfortable silences. These scenes feel authentic and true to real adolescent life.
Adding to this feeling is the film’s style. A lack of a traditional film score and the use of carefully composed framing create an almost documentary-like clarity in the film, helping the scenes feel more natural. The cinematography in Tomboy is minimalist, utilizing many long takes and little dramatic cutting. This purposeful style seems to tell the audience to focus on the events and the characters, allowing viewers to almost forget they’re watching a film.
Laure has a desire to be accepted on her own terms. Tomboy never seems to judge Laure for her feelings, nor does it judge anyone else for their reactions to Laure — the events are presented for our interpretation, without much filmmaker bias. The minimalist filming style, naturalistic acting and the film’s closing support this interpretation.
Tomboy teaches us a lot about relationships — between children, children and their parents and between one’s own heart and body. The film is poignant and suspenseful, and almost everyone can relate to Laure’s desire for acceptance.
Additionally, Tomboy comes at a perfect time — a time when many gay and transgender youth are still struggling to gain acceptance. Childhood can be an especially cruel time, and to see Laure emerge from this crisis intact and accepted is heartwarming.
A contemporary and touching bildungsroman, Tomboy is a beautiful exploration of childhood ambiguity and a brilliant second production for director Céline Sciamma.

With Thanksgiving gone and winter holidays quickly approaching, it’s an ominous time for fitness and health. Cold weather, a surplus of baked goods and an atmosphere of vacation are more than enough to keep college students curled up in blankets and sweaters, drinking hot chocolate and not thinking about exercise.
Health more than likely isn’t on your mind when you go home for the holidays, but isn’t one of the most common New Year’s resolutions to lose weight and get in shape? If you play your cards right in December, you won’t have to worry about that.
Just because it’s cold and windy outside doesn’t mean you shouldn’t work out. And you should exercise, not just to counteract holiday treat binges, but because winter is one of the best times to work the body.
Cold environments increase circulation by increasing blood flow, making limbs respond quicker to commands and facilitating easier breathing. So take advantage of the weather and go for a run outside.
Cold weather also has the added benefit of burning fat. The decrease in temperature forces the body to burn deposits in order to make up for heat that is taken away by a chilled environment. And research has shown that some cold exposure can actually boost the number of white blood cells in your body, making you more resistant to disease.
So what exercises can be done outside in the cold? It’s highly unlikely you’ll be able to get a full set of weight machines or equipment outdoors, so the best idea is to stick with bodyweight exercises. Running is extremely practical and best suited for the cold. But don’t rule out moves such as plyometrics or explosive dumbbell exercises. These can be done anywhere outside and are geared toward strength training. If they are tough when warmed up inside a gym, imagine how they are in the cold. It’s double the challenge and actually quite fun.
The best thing to do over winter break isn’t boosting cardiovascular movement or packing on muscle, but it’s actually keeping all the body’s muscles stimulated. Consistent muscle stimulation not only serves to keep the body warm, but also catalyzes metabolism and opens up pathways to muscles, which force the energy from food there, instead of being stored in the body as fat.
So after you’ve noshed on gingerbread or eggnog, do your body a favor and take a walk outside where it’s cold, or do some quick air squats and pushups. This not only helps digestion but helps keep fat gain low. Heavy workouts are great, but if you find yourself pressed for time, focus on the most effective exercises that take advantage of the season in the least amount of time.
Of course, not everyone has the chance to work out in the extreme cold. Many USC students are from southern California, where 50 degrees is considered cold and it tends to stay mild all winter. But that doesn’t mean students can’t benefit from winter exercises.
To get that cold exposure during a run, hit the road at night. The temperature is much lower thanks to the dryness of southern California, and although it might not be as cold as some parts of the world, the chill will provide the same benefits. And then be sure to cap off the run with a Scottish shower — half hot, half cold — to truly game the system.
If running isn’t your thing, try an early morning swim in the ocean.
Swimming is an amazing mix of strength training and cardiovascular exercise, and the water — even colder than usual thanks to the season — is sure to burn fat while you grow stronger. Summer swims and surf sessions are great exercise, but in the winter? They become the best workouts of the year.
Winter is also a chance to get some of the best workouts of any season. Despite the winter environment, it’s easy to avoid the pitfalls of the holidays. I intend to stay fit and healthy over the break. You should as well.

Since attaining stardom in 2005 and 2006 with songs such as “Pon De Replay” and “S.O.S.,” Rihanna has been shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl toward a more explicit and grown up style.
This new provocative direction, however, did not stop her success; on her last two albums, Rihanna has spawned an incredible seven singles in the Billboard Top 10. From this, it is quite clear where the expectations for Talk That Talk are set. Even with the bar set so high, Rihanna continues to deliver hits.
Musically, Talk That Talk can almost be separated into three categories or genres: techno, pop and hip-hop.
The two techno songs on the album, “Where Have You Been” and “We Found Love,” were assisted in production and writing by the popular DJ Calvin Harris. “Where Have You Been” features synthesized breakdowns and drops worthy of playing in any club, while keeping the pre-choruses calm with acoustic guitar. Unfortunately, the song’s beat easily drowns out Rihanna’s vocals, but that doesn’t take away from the song’s main purpose — to get you dancing.
The lead single, “We Found Love,” contains a similar vivacious energy as it exemplifies the perfect fusion of pop and dance music. An extremely catchy beat and chorus will have this song stuck in your head right away, and the verses’ melodies filled with high notes mesh seamlessly with the beat. Together, these components create yet another number one smash hit for Rihanna in countries around the world.
In contrast, Talk That Talk’s purely pop songs, including “Drunk On Love,” are extremely generic and disappointing. The beat sounds like your regular recycled pop number, with little creativity. Also, there’s no sense that Rihanna brings anything special to the track, making the songs seem like those from your average pop album instead of something unique.
While her energetic pop numbers are flawed, her pop ballads are considerably solid. “We All Want Love” brings the best out of Rihanna vocally, letting her voice shine over a simple beat full of spacious kick drums and spacey guitar.
The final track of the album also brings a similarly strong performance from Rihanna. “Farewell,” produced by Alex da Kid — who also worked with Rihanna on “Love the Way You Lie” — tells the story of someone she cares about having to leave to find a better life for himself. Though it likely won’t be as big of a hit, the emotions of the song will definitely connect with listeners.
Of all of the music on Talk That Talk, however, Rihanna seems to be at her best when bringing the hip-hop style to her songs. This is most noticeable on the title track, “Talk That Talk,” featuring hip-hop icon Jay-Z to start off the song. Consistent hit-producers StarGate lay down a synth-based mid-tempo beat, over which Rihanna and Hova attempt to recreate the hit-song magic found on their classic jam “Umbrella.” And it sounds like they got pretty close.
“Roc Me Out” and “Cockiness (Love It)” are  likely the album’s most hip-hop sounding tracks, both of which are sexually-driven and have a darker sound to them. “Roc Me Out,” however, is better on all fronts. Its mid-tempo synthesizer bass and hard-hitting drumbeat are much easier to listen to mixed with Rihanna’s forceful singing, while “Cockiness (Love It)” and its overuse of various vocal samples and 808 kick drums gets very repetitive very quickly. And hearing Rihanna tell you to “suck [her] cockiness” in the song’s rap-sing styled vocals does not help.
Don’t let the abundance of possible radio hits fool you; not every song on the album is a gem. The extremely short song “Birthday Cake” is confusing in multiple ways. First of all, it is just more than one minute in length and ends with an awkward fade out that sounds like a mistake, because it is in the middle of Rihanna singing a verse. Not to mention, the lyrics are hypersexualized and dull; this track is definitely one to skip over.
Even with a couple misses, it’s obvious Rihanna has released yet another album full of chart-topping hits, providing a blueprint for making hit songs. Musically, everything on this album can be found on her previous album Loud: hip-hop collaborations, techno-influenced club/dance songs and the occasional slow song.
But Talk That Talk seemingly abides by one very important rule: If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. And quite frankly, there isn’t much to fix. Whether you are a loyal fan in the Rihanna Navy — that’s what she calls her fan base — or someone simply looking for great pop music, you’ll surely find Talk That Talk fulfilling.

Healthy food options needed
A common complaint among USC students is the lack of healthy, nutritional food options around campus. There are no markets that offer entirely fresh, organic produce within a mile of school. The nearest healthy, organic market is far and unreachable to many students. USC should open an organic market on campus so students have access to healthy food.
Sufficient studies have shown the negative impacts of poor nutrition on the human body and development of the brain. A 2004 study from the Journal of Health Sciences shows a strong correlation in the rise of obesity and fast-food restaurants in the United States since 1970.
It is evident that fast-food and artificial additives and pesticides severely impact one’s health. These foods do not give individuals the energy and nourishment needed to meet their greatest potential.
With back-to-back classes it can be difficult to leave campus for hours at a time.
There are countless days where students have gone hungry because of the lack of accessibility to a decent meal or have been forced to resort to Panda Express. As a student who lives near campus, I am constantly faced with this dilemma and witness others dealing with it frequently.
In its role and mission statement, USC claims its central mission is, “The development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.”
The human mind cannot be “cultivated” and “enriched” properly without sufficient nutrition and diet. The Ronald Tutor Campus Center, however, continues to offer fast food of low quality.
By low quality, I mean food made from cheap, impure ingredients with little to no nutritional value. Not one campus center restaurant offers all pure, organic ingredients.
USC should open a market on campus with quality standards that offers the basic essential food categories of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and protein.
These foods would be offered with the options of buying them fresh, organic and free of artificial preservatives, flavors, sweeteners and hydrogenated fats.
This market would make better food and nutrition available to students, improving their overall quality of life.
Students who normally make the trek to the nearest Whole Foods would save time and gas by walking and could use their USCard to pay for groceries. Though better quality food is more expensive, students should at least have the option to buy it because what we eat directly impacts our health.
USC is comprised of a thriving student body and faculty that rely on a proper diet.
Our school is only as good as its students and faculty, and these individuals are only as good as the food that nourishes them.
Andrea Cortina
Senior, communication
Oh get over yourself. Nobody is forcing you to go Panda and organic food has been proven to be no healthier than not organic food. Superior and Ralph’s have more than fine produce sections. Get off your Whole Foods high horse.

For student entrepreneurs, the hardest obstacle often isn’t coming up with fantastic business ideas but lacking the means to get them off the ground.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
College students often don’t have the financial means or specific platforms to turn their innovative business ideas into reality.
Enter the Trojan Start-Ups Student Business Challenge, an innovative event launched by students in The Art and Adventure of Leadership (MDA 365) that provides student entrepreneurs with a platform to pitch their business ideas to businesses and a chance for the business to win a semester of free rent in the University Village.
The winner of the event, Yoki’s Garden, will eventually begin selling clothes and accessories made from game-worn USC athletic gear in the space left by the former USC Blood Donor Center.
USC should encourage more entrepreneurial ventures like Trojan Start-ups.
The students who founded the event and the competition’s participants illustrate that the best business ideas and leadership endeavors often come from college students themselves.
These students should be provided with every opportunity to puruse their business ideas. The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business is ranked as one of the top three entrepreneur programs in the country.
Its curriculum reflects its importance. In one introductory entrepreneurship class, students are given $5 and have to make as much money from it as possible in a span of one week.
USC Startup Weekend, an intense 54-hour event held last September, brought together people from different backgrounds who are all passionate about entrepreneurship and startups to focus on building a web or mobile application that could sustain a credible business.
Events such as Startup Weekend and the Trojan Start-Ups Student Business Challenge are fantastic, but USC should do more in addition to competitions to promote entrepreneurship and nurture the entrepreneurial talents of its students.
More scholarships geared toward high-performing students who plan to pursue entrepreneurship as a career or who have made progress in entrepreneurship during their time at USC can encourage students to branch out to non-traditional ways of practicing business.
More mentorship programs, in which student entrepreneurs could be paired with more experienced faculty or mentors who have successfully started their own businesses or work in related fields such as venture capital, can combine what students learn in the classroom with real life experience.
For example, the USC Stevens Institute of Innovation’s Social Innovation Fast Pitch training and mentoring program helps Los Angeles nonprofits grow and develop, but there isn’t a similar program that provides mentorship to USC students specifically.
The promotion of opportunities for cross-collaborative learning between different schools outside of Marshall would be especially helpful, as there are students in other majors interested in entrepreneurship. The university already attempted to establish a collaborative learning environment.
A Writing 340 class, intended for instruction this semester, that pairs Viterbi students with business students to work on an international consulting project was canceled after not enough engineering students signed up for the class.
Perhaps the class was not publicized enough within Viterbi or the opportunity itself was not adequately promoted to the rest of the student body.
USC should create unique classes that merge resources, capabilities and teachings from different schools.
The Lloyd Greif Center could partner with the USC School of Architecture to provide an elective course on how architecture students can start their own firm or practice, or it could partner with the School of Cinematic Arts to offer a course on how students can start their own film company.
USC could provide endless opportunities and programs to encourage students to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. If those students are provided a helpful nudge in the right direction, they’ll be more than on their way to inventing the next big thing.

I recently lost a large chunk of my music library. About a year ago, I would have been terribly upset. Much of my library was pirated, but on some level, I felt that it defined me. I prided myself on the collection of songs I had amassed because of its breadth.

This year, though? I have Spotify. So do plenty of other Americans: Earlier this year, U.S. Spotify users surpassed 1.4 million.
The service allows users to create playlists and mark favorites, but there’s no need to store anything on your hard drive.
Spotify is starting to change the way we think about music. We’re becoming less focused on ownership and more focused on pure access. To listen to your music on the go, all you need is an internet connection — or $10 a month. The mobility is refreshing.
Still, Spotify’s attempt at making music social is less impressive. The service recently partnered with Facebook. If you choose to link your Spotify and Facebook, you can create and share playlists with your friends.
Non-users probably also noticed that Spotify publishes everything you listen to in your friends’ news feeds.
Are some of these perks useful? Yes. It provides an easy way to share music with your friends without any concerted effort on your end.
If Spotify continues to rely on Facebook, however, it will never make music social in a way that introduces people to new songs and artists.
Facebook is a nice stepping-stone, but to maximize its potential, Spotify should strive to become its own social network.
Like a status update, video footage or a comment about your cousin’s wedding, music is meant to be shared.
A few centuries ago, people would have found the idea of sitting alone with a pair of headphones absurd. Technology allows us to listen in private, but most people still like to talk about their favorite tunes; most people still derive a special kind of joy from concerts, raves and dance parties.
Nevertheless, Spotify should recognize that the social function of music is not the same as the social function of, say, a photo album.
While a photo album says something about how you spend your time, a song says something about your particular taste.
The two aren’t always related. You don’t have to be an anarchist to enjoy punk. You don’t have to own a gun to be a fan of gangster rap — or country music, for that matter.
Unfortunately, many people still judge each other by music taste.
This tendency is especially strong among people who don’t know each other well; after all, they don’t have much to go off in the first place.
Because Facebook friend lists are more like acquaintance lists, most people on Facebook probably can’t put what you’re listening to into context.
That’s why I didn’t connect Spotify to Facebook. I see myself as a reasonably classy human being, but when exams and papers roll around, I put on an endless stream of Ke$ha.
I’ll admit that it’s silly to care too much about what other people think. Yet, Facebook is and always has been a way of putting your best foot forward. Spotify doesn’t give users that option. You have to bare all or bare nothing.
People who share your taste aren’t always people you’d want to know.
If Spotify were to become a self-contained social network, you would have the option to connect with people without sharing your life with them. Imagine profiles — not unlike those on Facebook — focused solely on peoples’ musical preferences. Imagine if, instead of listing people you might know, Spotify listed people whose music you might like.
Rather than wondering how many people saw our last embarrassing playlists, we would be discovering new artists with the help of people from all over the world.
Spotify is convenient. It allows users to sample a decent variety of music without forking over money for each song.
But if Spotify wants to go from convenient to indispensable, it needs to step up its social game.

Great article. Couldn’t agree more. From embarrassing songs to embarrassing playlist titles, I hate that my siblings or cousins can see what I listen to. Sometimes I want to share some and not others, and the current social media connections on Spotify don’t allow for that. Sad panda.
Great article–and I agree with you! But no whether I will click the ‘Share on Facebook’ button is a completely different story…

USC has received a $50 million donation from the Price Family Charitable Fund to endow the USC School of Policy, Planning and Development, which will be renamed the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, the school announced Monday.
The new endowment will provide USC Sol Price School with the resources to expand its social justice goals through the creation of the USC Sol Price Center for Social Innovation and make the USC Sol Price School the leading public policy schools in the nation.
“This gift allows us to achieve excellence in innovation and become the best school of public policy in the country,” USC Sol Price School Dean Jack Knott said. “It will also allow us to increase our social justice and urban development programs in partnership with the Price Family Charitable Fund.”
Um… what about the other elements of this new “school of policy” aka “planning and development.”
SPPD never had the word “administration” in it either but you never heard the PA students complaining.
Good point. Never thought of that.

A New York art project allowing passersby to fill in their own endings to the sentence “Before I die…” is scheduled to be taken down tomorrow.
The giant chalkboard project, erected on the wall of a future Shake Shack, was created by artist Candy Chang. Using stencils and spray paint, she established a half-block stretch of plywood with baskets of chalk to gather the dreams and aspirations of the Brooklyn community. Theresa Mullen, a Shake Shack spokeswoman, said the company constructed the project late Oct. 9. By the next morning, it was already overflowing with responses.
“This project helps you see a little bit of the hopes and dreams of the people around you,” Chang said to The Brooklyn Paper. “It’s about snapping out of it and remembering why you want to be alive in the world today.”
From the funny and creative to the heartbreaking and thoughtful, the responses were numerous: Before I die I want to … be tried for piracy, save a life, end animal cruelty, cook a soufflé, evaporate into light, hold her one more time, f–k Beyonce.
Chang’s first “Before I Die” project was created on the wall of a boarded up house in her neighborhood of New Orleans. According to Nola.com, the mural was not considered graffiti because Chang had permission to paint from both the property owner and city agencies. This art project was a huge success and expanded to other cities including Amsterdam, Portsmouth, Querétaro, Almaty and San Diego.
The projects have been featured in The Atlantic and The Oprah Magazine, in which the latter wrote,  “Through a series of large-scale projects that combine installation art with social activism, Chang has encouraged people to engage with public spaces to let their voices be heard.”

The Women of Troy earned third-place in the Freeport division of the Junkanoo Jam in the Bahamas over Thanksgiving break, defeating Gardner-Webb 82-41 after falling to No. 3 Notre Dame 80-58 in the opener.
The victory Saturday night over the Running Bulldogs snapped a three-game losing streak for USC (2-3), who had already played two teams ranked in the top 15 of the AP poll.
“It was very important for us to bounce back [against Gardner-Webb],” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “The margin of error for us is closing a little bit.”
The Women of Troy shook off their collective shooting slump against Gardner-Webb (0-6), making 54 percent of their shots from the floor and converting 10 of 20 three-point attempts.
Senior guard Ashley Corral led USC with 22 points, making six of her nine shots from behind the arc and recording three assists. In all, four USC players scored in double digits.
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci led the effort on the boards with 14 rebounds, and the Women of Troy outrebounded Gardner-Webb 41-22.
USC never trailed in the game, but the Running Bulldogs were nipping at USC’s heels throughout most of the first half. A 12-1 run in the last 5:10 before halftime gave the Women of Troy a comfortable 38-20 advantage.
That lead was extended as soon as the second half tipped off, as USC outscored Gardner-Webb 17-1 out of the break to put the game out of reach.
The rout restored USC’s confidence after three consecutive losses, including the 22-point defeat to 2011 NCAA tournament runner-up Notre Dame (5-1) on Friday night.
“I thought we did a great job against Notre Dame for the first 17 minutes, then we stopped doing what we needed to do,” Cooper said. “A lot of people are going to say our schedule is too tough, but our schedule is perfect for us. We just didn’t play a complete game.”
Against the 2011 NCAA finalists, the Women of Troy did manage to avoid the slow starts that plagued them in the young season, taking a 13-11 lead on a three from senior Briana Gilbreath.
But from there, Notre Dame went on a 9-1 run littered with several USC turnovers and never trailed again on its way to building a 12-point halftime margin.
“You can’t have [21] turnovers against elite teams, that turns into a lot of easy baskets for them,” Cooper said. “We did a lot of things well, but [Notre Dame] showed why they’re one of the top teams in the country.
Back-to-back three-pointers from Corral early in the second half cut the lead to nine points, but the Fighting Irish outscored USC 20-5 in the next seven minutes to pull away for good.
Junior guard Skylar Diggins, a two-time All-American, led Notre Dame with 22 points and five steals. Corral paced USC with 17 points, but also committed eight turnovers to only two assists.
Cooper pointed to three facets of the game — turnovers, rebounding and making easy baskets — that the Women of Troy need to work on if they want to pull off an upset against one of the many ranked teams remaining on their schedule.
“I think we missed 13 or 14 layups in the Notre Dame game,” Cooper said. “[Lay-ups] kill runs or keep runs alive. We have to make those shots.”
The Women of Troy return home this week to play Texas-San Antonio at the Galen Center on Wednesday night at 7 p.m.

The set up: USC, fresh off a monumental win in Oregon the week before, played host to its crosstown rival UCLA for the city championship. Technically, the Pac-12 South Division title was on the line. While the Bruins had already clinched their status as south “representatives” because of the Trojans’ bowl ban, an upset of USC and they would claim the title outright. Earlier in the week, UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel provided some bulletin board material when he said the Bruins had “closed the gap” between the two teams.
