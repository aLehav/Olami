The American actor effected a change in his affect to affect his chances of getting a role as a British character. He affected a British accent and a flat affect, which had the positive effect of getting him the part.
Confused? It’s okay — you’re not alone. “Affect” versus “effect” is one of those rules that’s understandably confusing to many people, but also makes your writing look incredibly sloppy if messed up. It doesn’t help that they’re pronounced almost exactly alike and that each word has multiple, overlapping meanings. Combined, “affect” and “effect” have five different meanings, which is honestly about three too many for my taste.
I’ll go into all the obscure ways you can use “affect” and “effect” in a moment, but since you probably won’t run into those usages all the time, I’ll first give you an easy way to remember the difference between the most common meanings of “affect” and “effect.” 
If you ever find yourself mixing them up, just RAVEN — Remember, Affect is a Verb and Effect is a Noun — usually. If you want to make sure you’re using the right word, it gets a lot more complicated than that. 
“Affect” is usually a verb that means “to influence something” as in, “The rain will affect the football team’s performance.” However, it can also mean “to pretend to feel something,” as in “I affected a smile” or “His accent is an affect.” It can even be a psychology term meaning “emotion or behavior,” as in “The man had a blunted affect.”
“Effect” is usually a noun that means “a change resulting from an action,” as in “That speech really had an effect on me.” It can also be a verb — this is the tricky part — that at first glance looks like a synonym for “affect,” but actually differs very subtly. Here, “effect” means “to cause something,” as in “The placebo did not effect any changes in the patient.”
If you feel overwhelmed by now, don’t worry. As long as you can RAVEN, you’ll be set most of the time. So the next time you’re struggling to choose between “affect” and “effect,” keep calm — and RAVEN on.

For those of you who’ve been around as long as I have, Sunday’s announcement that former head coach Steve Sarkisian was asked to take an indefinite leave of absence from his role at the helm of Trojan Football was probably unanticipated. But for upperclassmen, it was eerily familiar to a situation that occurred just two years ago.
It was also on a Sunday, two years ago, when the Trojans — who were also 3-2 at the time — were met with an unexpected leadership switch. 
Yes, I’m talking about the firing of Lane Kiffin. 
My memories of that breaking news are still fresh, as if it just happened yesterday. Like the dismissal of Sarkisian, the news also broke on a Sunday, which means I — like every other editor of the DT at the time — was in the middle of production for our Monday issue. I remember walking into the newsroom just as Athletic Director Pat Haden was beginning a press conference on the television to address the wave of events that literally unfolded overnight. 
Haden recalled how, after the Trojans suffered a humiliating 62-41 defeat at the hands of the Sun Devils in Tempe, Arizona, he had to make the difficult decision to dismiss Kiffin from his role, literally leaving him at the terminal of the Los Angeles International Airport. Without dwelling too much on painful memories, let’s just say that the whole situation seemed unreal. Not only did we have to factor this huge piece of breaking news into our coverage, but we also had to do it while our sports editors were still stuck in Tempe, having just covered the game the night before. 
As far as average days in the newsroom go, that definitely wasn’t one of them. 
When the press conference ended, the editors immediately mobilized into action, each doing their respective part to ensure we were covering the news as quickly and accurately as we could. Page layouts were reorganized, column topics changed and interview requests were made at rapid speed. As one of the online editors at the time, I was tasked with making sure we were pushing out our reporting on social media as quickly as possible (read: I tweeted). 
In a lot of ways, last Sunday’s production was a lot like the one two years ago — lots of questions, lots of excitement and lots of eagerness to be on top of the story. But there were also some notable differences. This time around, we were lucky to have all of our editors in the newsroom ready to tackle the issue head on. Moreover, my vantage point on the situation changed. As managing editor alongside DT editor-in-chief Isabella Sayyah and associate managing editors Emma Peplow and Burke Gibson, my job is to oversee all aspects of publication from start to finish. Watching all the pieces come together — from the stories to the photos, to the layouts and headlines — is pretty amazing, and watching it happen on a day when there’s breaking news is no exception. 
Like any Trojan would tell you, fighting on through the changes and controversies in our football season is never easy. But I’m glad that we as editors can be behind the desk when they happen, and hopefully bring some good to the situation through our coverage.

We are ’SC · Keyshawn Johnson, alumnus and former NFL player, spoke to players and students after the team’s practice Thursday. Jackson Dahl, a senior majoring in business administration, organized the rally for students to attend the practice before the team faces Notre Dame. – Maya Dondonayan | Daily Trojan
As USC football players left Howard Jones field after practice on Thursday, they were met with cheers, applause and chants of “We are SC!” and “Beat the Irish!” from students  on the sidelines.
Students gathered for the team’s final practice before heading to face Notre Dame as part of a rally organized by Jackson Dahl, a senior majoring in business administration.
“I was talking with a close friend and mentor Professor [David] Belasco, who has a lot of connections to the athletic program, and we were thinking, ‘It’s been a really rough week — it’s been a really rough four years,’” Dahl said. “We were thinking, ‘What could we do that would be really special?’ — hopefully lift [the team] a little bit as they go off to Notre Dame for probably the toughest game of the year.”
Belasco, co-director and adjunct professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in the Marshall School of Business who teaches the popular class “The Leap,” said the idea for the rally came to him on Tuesday night.
“I went here, I teach here. This is why they call it a Trojan Family -— we show up for each other when we need it,” he said. “This team has been through so much beyond their control over the last few years between sanctions and abrupt coaching changes that we just felt we needed to tell them, ‘It’s our team, it’s our University,’ and show up for them.”
Belasco spoke to J.K. McKay, senior associate athletic director for football, and reached out to Dahl to get students involved. Dahl created a Facebook event for the rally and sent out emails to generate awareness.
“When you want anything done, you get students involved quickly,” Belasco said. “You can tell that students were ready to receive this and support this because they all feel the same way: ‘What can we do to show our support for these players?’”
Students joined the players in the huddle after practice where several former NFL football players who played for USC — Keyshawn Johnson, Willie McGinest and Keith Rivers — gave motivational speeches to the team.
“It wasn’t us reaching out to the Trojan Family, it was the [Trojan Family] reaching out to us,” interim head coach Clay Helton said. “That’s what makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.”
More than 500 students said they would attend the rally on Facebook, but actual attendance was closer to 50. Will Orr, a senior majoring in law, history and culture said that while he was slightly disappointed with the turnout, he was glad to be able to support the team.
“Two years ago, we said ‘one team, one heart,’ and I think that message still rings true,” he said. “I think Helton’s a helluva coach, and I think we’re going to finish the season strong, the team’s really coming together.”
Eric Hahn, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business, said the turmoil surrounding USC football earlier in the week drove him to attend the rally.
“We had a tough week, a lot of stuff’s gone down,” he said. “Sark’s gone, but the one thing that brings us together is football and the Trojan Family, so it’s always worth coming out and supporting our guys.”
Dahl said he is considering hosting more rallies in the future.
“[Today’s rally] was super grassroots. We planned it the day before, but it’d be cool to see something happen with a little more momentum,” he said.

Playing dead · Actors in makeup were positioned around campus portraying injured persons who were affected by an earthquake. – Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
USC participated in a large-scale Great ShakeOut drill coordinated by Provost Michael Quick and Mark Benthien, associate director of the Southern California Earthquake Center and coordinator of Global ShakeOut, on Thursday morning.
At 10:15 a.m., students were encouraged to drop, cover and hold on, and emergency crews and teams — Disaster Mental Health team, Amateur Radio Emergency Communications team, Department of Public Safety Command Post and HazMat teams — performed a mock search and rescue to prepare for the next major earthquake in Southern California.
This ShakeOut drill was taken seriously by faculty and administrators. Actors portraying injured persons were given makeup showing the extent of the carnage that an earthquake can create. Some actors were living, and others were portrayed as dead. Emergency crews were on site to perform disaster triage on the mock victims to determine those who were in dire need of immediate medical attention and transport them safely to Cromwell Field.
Once the drill was completed, the Community Emergency Response team used the process of cribbing, in which an object on top of the victim is pried off and then held up using support structures.
Set-up for the drill commenced at 4 a.m. in front of the West Lobby of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism building for a wide array of displays relating to earthquake safety by nonprofits, companies and governmental organizations including California Earthquake authority, Earthquake Country Alliance, Los Angeles County, Los Angeles City, Ready America, Red Cross, Simpson Strong-Tie and Temblor, Inc.
All representatives of these entities agreed that preparedness is key to avoiding disaster when the next earthquake hits.
“We need to be prepared for the next major earthquake,” said Guillermo Sanchez, manager of preparedness and resiliency at Red Cross for Los Angeles County. “There are two steps to being prepared — getting a kit and making a plan and staying informed.”
Simpson Strong-Tie was invited by the ShakeOut committee to explain how they outfit existing residential and office buildings so that they are earthquake safe.
“We mainly retrofit soft story buildings that have no rigidity and can collapse,” said Carlos Zarate, territory manager for Simpson Strong-Tie. “Our moment frames give those buildings rigidity so they don’t collapse.”
Earthquake preparedness has begun to be explored in a new way with technology pioneered by Temblor, Inc., which has created a free app that ranks hazard and projects costs and injury according to location.
“Temblor is a mobile-friendly web app that basically personalizes earthquake information and brings the information down to your home level,” said Volkan Sevilgen, CTO and cofounder of Temblor, Inc. “It’s based on credible scientific data and methodologies. Everything is very well explained, so we are hoping that people will see the information as a credible independent source of seismic hazard.”
The Great ShakeOut is organized around the world. According to their website, 26.5 million participated in last year’s ShakeOut. 10.4 million of those who participated live in California. Approximately 1 million were in the City of Los Angeles and 100,000 were involved in the planning and execution.
In addition to booths and information on preparedness, a trailer was set up to create a scenario that would replicate the conditions of an earthquake, including the magnitude of the shaking.
A press conference describing the campus proceedings and highlighting the need for preparedness was held at 8:15 a.m.
Speeches were given by Quick, William Regensburger, director of USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning; James Featherstone, general manager of the City of Los Angeles’s Emergency Management Department; Mona Bontty, California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services Southern regional administrator; Chris Nance, director of communications and external affairs at California Earthquake Authority; and Jarrett Barrios, regional CEO of the Los Angeles Region of the Red Cross, following a brief introduction by Benthian.
“ShakeOut is headquartered here at USC and it’s happening all around the world,” Benthian said. “I welcome all of you who are here today to learn about earthquake safety, what’s happening in terms of the ShakeOut and to learn about what is going to be happening today, when USC participates in the ShakeOut.”
Quick started off a line of speakers from a more USC-centric perspective.
“We [at USC] think a lot about our responsibility to take on the big problems of the world, to do the research and scholarship and translate that research and scholarship into action and global impact,” Quick said.

The Southern California Earthquake Center is managed at USC, making the University a hub for earthquake research and hazard prevention.
“They really get out in the world and make a difference,” Quick said. “Preparedness is going to matter tremendously for the earthquakes that may happen here in Southern California.”
Regensburger then talked about the specifics of the drill.
“You’ll see a response team for all 300 buildings, who are coming outside, setting up a command post and really walking though their role in a major disaster,” Regensburger said.
Featherstone echoed the importance of preparedness and the government’s responsibility to the people following a disaster in his speech.
Bontty ended the conference by stressing the necessity of adhering to the drop, cover and hold on guidelines and preparing in advance for the possibility of a major earthquake.
Quick said the ShakeOut and the events preceding it illustrate USC’s commitment to emergency preparedness.
“I’m so proud that this institution takes earthquake threats so seriously,” Quick said.
All USC students and staffs should remove any books, reports, binders, boxes that are potential falling hazards over their desks, futons, sofa, sleeping or reading areas. All trophies, class pictures, microwave, stolen street signs, 3-D models should be either anchored or removed from high places that may harm any person or lab animal or valuable foliage in the foreseen event. All stack areas and rack areas and warehouses shall post sign forbidding overnight stays. All file cabinets should be latched or locked at the end of days to avoid drawers rolling and tilt over.requiring clean up after said event.
Do not park BMW under any tilted, leaning or otherwise unbalanced tree overnight. (VW is ok.) Likewise avoid the same for any similar kind statutes, monuments, obelisks, masonry chimneys, parapets, clock tower, cell towers, light masts, traffic lights, architectural gingerbread, HOLLYWOOD signs, prefab stairway (remove any homeless as well). Stay away from any cafe with dropped pendant lights next to huge glazing. (You know the ones)
Citations will be issued by JPL patrols for a demerit for the offenses stated in the first para. but will be pardoned after the two years if foreseen event does not occur.

USC Libraries Discovery Fellow Geoff Manaugh came to Doheny Memorial Library on Thursday evening to introduce a new exhibit: “Los Angeles to be Determined,” an interactive project that incorporates game design, storytelling and architectural modeling to allow visitors to visualize Los Angeles in the future.
The L.A.T.B.D exhibit is located in the Treasury Room in Doheny. It will allow visitors to take a look at USC’s archives of L.A. history as well as the possibilities that citizens have to imagine and create their own future for the city of Los Angeles. This exhibit is unique because it will give visitors an interactive glimpse into L.A.’s past, as well as explore L.A.’s possibilities for the future.
L.A.T.B.D was created by architecture and design writer Geoff Manauagh. He is a writer of the architecture blog BLDGBLOG. He worked in collaboration with London architects Mark Smout and Laura Allen from the firm Smout Allen. Professor Jeff Watson and his students at the School of Cinematic Arts were also able to share their insight on the game-design aspect as well.
“Design is a way of imagining the future,” Watson said. “Collaborative games are about creative brainstorming. It is a good way to structure that community imagination about a certain place.”
This exhibit is a manifestation of utilizing USC’s archival collection of Los Angeles to create a relationship between urban design and architecture.
“It is interesting how this exhibit combines a virtual game with architectural design. Students should come to this exhibit to learn about the future of L.A. and USC in terms of design and architecture,” said Chen Zou, a first-year graduate student of business and analytics.
When creating this game for L.A.’s design future, the collaborators conducted extensive research. Researchers took many things into consideration when creating L.A.T.B.D. Some of these aspects included Los Angeles’s freeway system, demography, landscape, gentrification, climate and history. Students have already begun to talk about how L.A. can evolve.
“The diversity of L.A.’s architecture is one of my favorite things about this city. When I think about the future of L.A., I think about ways that USC can be expanded,” said Ivy Hu, a graduate student in education. “It is also exciting because the presentation is impressive. Those that worked to create it are very qualified.”
When visitors walk into the Treasury Room, they will be greeted by a description of the exhibit. On their left will be a collection of USC’s archive on L.A. history. There will be a display of actual artifacts mixed with fake, or ghost, artifacts designed by the creators.
“With these ghost artifacts, our plan is to blur the line between fact and fiction,” Manaugh said.
He explained that the goal is to turn an abstract idea into something concrete. This exhibit was created to encourage visitors to have an open mind about the future, something Zou feels is important.
“L.A. is very decentralized, and it is hard for me to travel Downtown,” Zou said. “I really like how this  exhibit can cause discussion for the future of L.A. It is important to think about how to make a better future.”
Because it is designed like a board game, visitors can gather information to create ideas of how they think L.A.’s architected future should look. The exhibit will then lead visitors to a series of 3D urban models that show hypothetical moments in L.A.’s future. These models were created by architects Smout and Allen.

Strictly business · Sophomore Adoree’ Jackson and the Trojans hope to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the famous “Bush Push” with the program’s seventh victory in its last 10 games in South Bend. – Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In the first game since the firing of former head coach Steve Sarkisian, the Trojans will travel to South Bend, Indiana, to take on rival No. 14 Notre Dame. Interim head coach Clay Helton will lead the 3-2 Trojans for the second time on Saturday, having coached them to a win in the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl.
The Trojans are coming off a loss to an unranked team in the Washington Huskies, their second Pac-12 loss already this season. The Fighting Irish, however, have only lost one game this season, falling to Clemson on Oct. 3.
“Fortunately or unfortunately, I have been in this situation before. Once again very fortunate to have a group of first-class kids that are extremely talented and want to do something special here,” Helton said. “They still have a lot of things out here that we can obtain. We have a big game versus Notre Dame this week.”
Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler will square off against a stout Notre Dame secondary. The quarterback is coming off a game in which he threw two interceptions and no touchdown passes. Though he is coming off one of his worst games in a year, Kessler threw for 372 yards and six touchdowns against the Irish last year in the Coliseum.
“We’ve been through a lot of adversity, and that’s what we do best is move on,” redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “We have an opportunity to do something great this weekend. Notre Dame is a great football team and we’re excited to get out there. It’s going to be a crazy game out in South Bend and we’re excited. We can’t wait to get back out there and get ready to go play a game.”
Overall this season, Kessler has thrown 15 touchdown passes to just 3 interceptions. Kessler’s favorite target, wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, has 619 yards and 6 touchdowns this season. Smith-Schuster is also coming off a game where he was held to only 82 yards on six receptions and no touchdowns.
Last time these teams met, the Trojans handed the Irish a 49-14 beatdown in the Coliseum. A lot has changed since the last time the two teams faced off, however. Not only has USC changed coaches, but the Irish have changed quarterbacks.
Former starting quarterback Malik Ziare went down in the second game of the season with a broken ankle, leaving DeShone Kizer as the playcaller for the Fighting Irish. Kizer has since thrown for 1143 yards and 8 touchdown passes with a 65.9 percent completion rate. Kizer, however, represents more of a threat on the ground than Ziare ever did, something the Trojan defense has struggled to stop all season.
In addition to being without Sarkisian, the Trojans will also have to play the remainder of the season without All-American center Max Tuerk, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against Washington. Sophomore Toa Lobendahn will take over for Tuerk at center.
“You never want to have an injury, but thank goodness we put the investment in earlier in the season to prepare for this,” Helton said.
Though the offense was stalled against Washington, the run game seemed to be unstoppable.
Redshirt senior Tre Madden and freshman Ronald Jones combined for 185 rushing yards against the Huskies, and have provided the Trojans with over 600 combined yards and seven touchdowns so far this season.
The Trojans will need another performance like this to get by the Fighting Irish. Madden has been somewhat limited by injury all season but is expected to play on Saturday.
While the Trojans are underdogs coming into this week’s game, Helton believes that his team will overcome the challenges it has faced in the past week and come away with a big win in a rivalry game.
‘’Anytime you have a fresh start and new beginnings, it’s exciting for anybody,’’ Helton said. ‘’And plus, it’s rivalry week. It’s Notre Dame. That’s special.”
Kickoff is set for 4:30 p.m. in South Bend. It will air live on NBC.
Good luck! Here come the IRISH!!!!

Netting it · Freshman driver Nick Lavayen and the USC scoring attack aim to eclipse the 300-goal scoring mark on the season this weekend. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
It will be another busy weekend for the No. 2-ranked men’s water polo team, as they take on two top 10 opponents, No. 9 Pepperdine and No. 6 UC Santa Barbara, in MPSF action.
USC will host the Waves on Saturday and travel to Santa Barbara on Sunday, with both games starting at noon.
The Trojans are coming off a second-place finish in the SoCal Tournament, where they lost to No. 1 UCLA in the championship game on a late goal by the Bruins. Grant Stein recorded a hat trick in the 10-9 defeat after a comeback attempt fell just short.
“We realized we need to start focusing more on the middle of game rather than just in the beginning and end,” Stein said of the loss.
Stein is the second leading goal scorer on the team with 27 goals, a ways behind sophomore transfer Blake Edwards, who leads the team with 47 tallies. Matteo Morelli and Lachlan Edwards each have 25 goals.
The Trojans have dominated on both ends this season, ranking first in the MPSF in offense and second in defense. They have outscored their opponents 295-96 and allowed just 5.65 goals per game with 13 shutout periods of regulation play thus far.
“On offense, we have a lot of finishers,” Stein said. “Everyone on our team can shoot, finish and drive. We have a great 5-on-6 defense. With McQuin [Baron] in the cage, it’s really hard for teams to score on him.”
But redshirt junior Luke Felton was not satisfied, wanting to be first in both categories.
“Ultimately we want to be first in offense and defense,” he said. “Scoring a lot of goals is not a problem for us, but if we key in on our defensive mistakes, we can clean up our mistakes and be the top team.”
Pepperdine finished ninth in the SoCal Tournament. The Waves, who co-hosted the tournament with LMU, lost to UC Irvine 13-12 in their first game but won their next three, beating Pomona, Santa Clara and Air Force by a combined score of 44-18.
But the Trojans are comfortable facing the team from Malibu.
“We’ve been playing Pepperdine all over summer, and we haven’t had too many problems with them,” Stein said. “We’re training this week for Santa Barbara more than Pepperdine.”
UC Santa Barbara is winless in two MPSF games thus far, placing sixth in the SoCal invitational, where it lost to USC 10-8 in group play. However, the result was closer than the Trojans would have liked.
“They gave us a tough time, especially in the second half,” Felton said. “We want to build upon what takeaways we got from that game. We want the score to be a little bit higher for us and lower for them.”
The Trojans should be familiar with the Gauchos, playing them in consecutive weeks.
“After playing Santa Barbara, we know what their tactics are, and we’re going to focus on that,” Stein said. “We know who their main players and shooters are. I think we’ll be ready.”
USC has won 15 straight games over Pepperdine and has a 61-19-2 all-time record against the Waves.
Against UC Santa Barbara, the Trojans have won 50 consecutive games and have a 67-12-2 record all-time.

The spotlight finally turns back to the football field this Saturday — where it will hopefully stay for the remainder of the season.
Through all of the events that have transpired over one of the crazier weeks at USC in recent memory, my focus, unlike the focus of many, hasn’t been on who the program should hire as its next head coach or whether Athletic Director Pat Haden knowingly appointed an alleged alcoholic to lead his football program.
The common denominator here is the well-being of the student-athletes themselves; they should be the central focal point for any coach, athletic administrator, fan or anyone on the outside looking in. Through thick and thin, it should always be about what’s best for the kids.
Over the course of this past week, I’ve heard sports talk shows throwing out phrases like “dark times at Troy” and “Bumpy road ahead for USC.” But then I go out on to the practice field and see just a glimpse of light — USC players continuing to play their tails off in every drill and practice segment, while working with each of their teammates to make them better at their respective positions.
I’ve spoken to a few players since interim head coach Clay Helton took over, and each of them said that they loved Helton and what he was doing to get the team pumped up and ready to play in a rivalry game against Notre Dame.
Ed Orgeron 2.0 is what people surrounding the program are beginning to call Helton, who before stepping into his new role wasn’t known for having much of a personality. He has disproved that initial impression of him, though.
If you remember, Orgeron was notorious for providing Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles catering, cookies and taking the team to private movie screenings.
On Tuesday, Helton did something similar when he organized a BBQ dinner for the team and staff, where everyone sat down in the same room to watch the new ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “Trojan War.”
The two may be similar in the methods each of them have used to motivate the team, but Helton has the chance to do something Orgeron didn’t do during his midseason coaching stint: beat the Fighting Irish in South Bend.
Interim head coach Clay Helton has replanted the seed and added water, but the light will only shine on his team if the Trojans are able to win in Notre Dame for the first time since 2011.
Effectively, the light rests with the hypothetical pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and the Irish are the only thing standing in USC’s way.
This game has the power to be a turning point in the Trojans season and get to them back in the right direction as they enter the second half of their season, which features solely Pac-12 conference play.
Continuing the trend of new beginnings, USC is an underdog going into a game for the first time this season. It seems like the only thing constant right now for this team is change — but it’s the type that should be celebrated.
In just the second midseason coaching change in two years, the program is once again experiencing a sense of awakening and freshness that is much-needed after the team’s lackluster performance last Thursday against Washington.
It’s a notion of youthful innocence that allows this sensation around the program to come into fruition.
Regardless of who the Trojans’ head coach is, these players are going to try and replicate what they’ve learned to do throughout their entire lives: play football at a high level.  They’re on the roster at USC for a reason, and that carries two important responsibilities: to be upstanding representatives of the program and win football games.
Even though their former head coach seemed to have trouble doing both of those things in recent months, the Trojans now have the opportunity to go out and show the rest of the country that even while dealing with a great deal of adversity, USC is still a force to be reckoned with on the national stage.
USC great Keyshawn Johnson said it best at the team’s practice on Thursday.
“The world will be watching to see how you respond,” Johnson said. “I want to talk about how you won at Notre Dame.”
More than ever, the Trojans need to do just that. At this juncture, it’s the only thing that can save their season.

There’s no doubt that this year has been a big one for comedian Amy Schumer. From writing and starring in the summer blockbuster Trainwreck to locking down an Emmy win for her sketch comedy show Inside Amy Schumer and successfully hosting Saturday Night Live last weekend, Schumer has established herself as a multifaceted tour de force. Her upcoming HBO special, Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo, is another success to add her to her laundry list of accomplishments.
Though it might seem like she has suddenly appeared on the scene, Schumer has actually been around the comedy world for quite some time. She got her big break while competing on the show Last Comic Standing, in which she placed fourth, and bounced around small gigs within the Comedy Central vicinity until she started being widely recognized for her work. No doubt Schumer is a stand-up veteran, and in her special, she touches upon what it’s like to be launched into Hollywood’s big leagues as a female comedian, saying it can be a recipe for disaster, albeit a hilarious one. Schumer discusses some of these issues she’s come across on her recent journey to fame, including the fact that all residents of Los Angeles are too pretty for their own good. After meeting Kate Upton, she said she realized, “I’m not a real woman, I’m just harvesting organs in case one of them ever needs a liver or something  for one.”
Additionally, Schumer has joked that her new celebrity personal trainer, after getting her to lose 10 pounds by cutting alcohol from her diet, acted “like he’d taught Helen Keller how to read.” And, as pretty much anybody would assume, since she and Bradley Cooper had a conversation that lasted longer than 30 seconds, it definitely means that they’re dating. Perhaps most appropriately, she walks on stage accompanied by a bottle of wine instead of a glass of water, and takes a swig every so often after an especially flippant joke.
Expectedly, the performance is also chock full of her signature irreverent and often inappropriate humor; Schumer even admits she doesn’t mind being labeled “that sex comic.” Realistically, the fact that Schumer is a woman with “dude humor” makes her more relatable and brings a refreshing change to the ranks of Hollywood women. She is able to break stereotypes when discussing situations and topics that are often reserved for men by holding her own and beating the guys at their own game. Her comedy often touches on feminist subject matter, as she speaks freely about the challenges of gender inequality, sexuality and femininity — saying all the things about UTIs that everyone thinks but is too embarrassed to say out loud and addressing the fact that all women have thought at one point, “Am I maybe … gorgeous? I just haven’t found the right hairstyle yet!” The only downside to the special is that it is a bit predictable, but perhaps those who are fans of Schumer flock to see her perform because they expect to see the raunchy and spirited humor she has branded as her own.
Schumer’s fans don’t belong to a specific demographic — they range from teenage boys who appreciate her explicit humor to 20-something women who both  idolize and empathize with her, as well as middle-aged parents who respect her daring comedy. Most will be pleased with Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo, as the program offers a sampling of the best things everyone loves about Schumer.
Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo premieres Oct. 17 at 10 p.m. on HBO.

Lights, camera, action · Director Hou Hsiao-Hsien is the mastermind behind The Assassin, out Oct. 16 in select theaters. Famous for not having rehearsals before production, Hsiao-Hsien did extensive research in order to achieve an accurate look of the Tang dynasty. – Photo courtesy of Well Go USA Entertainment
Every great director has a defining style. David Fincher’s meticulous attention to detail is achieved through the use of countless takes. Almost every Alfred Hitchcock-helmed movie features an icy blonde on the run. Director Hou Hsiao-Hsien, however, is famous for his
no-rehearsal rule.
Making a movie without the safety net of rehearsals might sound like a daunting task, especially because Hou’s latest film, The Assassin, centers on a female crusader tasked with killing corrupt government officials. As with any film of the wuxia genre, the movie showcases intricate fighting sequences. But Hou contends that a lack of rehearsal did not affect production. Rather, it made the film stronger, as the structure of shooting allowed there to be more focus on the action.
“We would practice a particular part of the movie and shoot that,” Hou said in a roundtable interview through an interpreter. “We would shoot a few movements here, stop, let them practice and come back for the next part and break everything down in bits and pieces.”
To add further dimension to his film, Hou also employed the use of both professional and
non-professional actors. Hou said his directing style never changed between the background actors of The Assassin, including those who played servants and the village people, and the actors who got first bill.
“I personally get in the situation, get in the context of what they’re doing, and often they’re able to discern and figure out what they should do as we move on,” Hou said. “So, once you have the camera ready, once you have the lights set up, everything is ready to go.”
But the allure of the film goes beyond the acting. To capture ancient China as accurately as possible, Hou and his team did extensive research on the time period, reading historical documents such as Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang. Moreover, with the addition of silk curtains and fabrics, the film shows the opulence of that time period. Still, Hou maintains that it is hard to precisely express the essence of that time.
“The times have changed,” Hou said. “It would be great to have a time machine to go back to Tang Dynasty and know exactly what the world looks like and come back, but obviously that’s not possible.”
Another element that differentiates The Assassin from other films is the use of 35mm film. After scenes were captured, they were scanned and transferred into a digital format. But the use of film is an expensive tactic, as over the course of The Assassin’s production, more than 440,000 feet of film went into shooting, but only 10,000 feet of footage made it into the film. Though Hou said the film adds many layers, he was interested in using digital means for his next movie, especially because much of media content is now found on the internet.
“I feel like cinema is really changing, really evolving,” Hou said. “A lot of people consume content and watch movies on the internet, so I feel like what might happen is that visual expression might change because of how people are looking at images on the screen. There could be many interesting possibilities in terms of what we can do because now you can play with the expression and frame.”
At the possibility of using other mediums for his films, Hou felt optimistic that digital films can actually contribute to filmmaking that is more tailored to personal interests.
“I feel like [digitalization] can actually help increase personal filmmaking because now you have the freedom to play around with a visual language because it’s no longer confined to the theatrical screen,” Hou said. “Without the confines of a certain size to fit. I see it as something that could actually be helpful to the evolution of cinema.”

With Halloween approaching, Harry Potter, a series that caused an entire generation to fall in love with magic and with reading, has been on my mind. For all lovers of the world author J. K. Rowling created, myself included, this month is bringing something new to look forward to — the release of the new, illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.
This book has been receiving a lot of positive attention, and I for one have been hearing about it online and from friends every day for the last few weeks. To give a little background, this edition was commissioned by Bloomsbury, the original publisher of the Harry Potter series. Famed illustrator and winner of the 2012 Kate Greenaway Medal Jim Kay was asked to take on the gargantuan project of illustrating not one, but all seven of the Harry Potter books. After two years of work, we can finally see the first installment this month.
Using the films and Rowling’s vivid description of an imaginary world as guidance, Kay has created a world so beautiful that readers feel as though they could thrust their hand into the pages and grasp at it. I must admit, I was skeptical when I first heard about this most recent reimagining of a series so near and dear to my heart. I grew up reading the books before the movies were released, meaning that the mental image I created of Harry’s world was something very important to me. I didn’t want a barrage of new images to obstruct my own, but I was pleasantly surprised. The pictures are vibrantly colorful and incredibly detailed, yet somehow don’t seem intrusive. They are, in all honesty, truly gorgeous pictures that are works of art on their own. Kay doesn’t simplify the images as many children’s illustrators do. He captures the magic, intricacy and excitement of one of the most beloved children’s books of all time.
Still, I do have some qualms with this illustrated idea. Adding pictures to a book removes the most powerful aspects of the written word: its ability to produce images in the mind, to spark the imagination and to create new worlds that belong to the reader alone. Suddenly, with this edition of the book, the readers share Hogwarts, Diagon Alley and the faces of their favorite characters with millions of other readers. I understand that this illustrated version was published, on the whole, for the most devoted fans of the series. This is probably why a more expensive and extensive deluxe edition is also available. New readers coming to the series will most likely still read the unillustrated version, but the publication of this new version runs the risk that some people may enter the world, not just through Rowling’s eyes, but also through Kay’s. I feel that this will only create another barrier between the reader and the story, and the most powerful stories are those in which the reader feels the closest to the characters and the action.
Another problem that I have with this new edition is that it might be centered on money. Just as the excitement around the books, the films and Pottermore starts to die down, Rowling and Bloomsbury release a pricey hardcover copy of the first book in the series, with the promise of more to come and the knowledge that the series has a devoted enough fan base that will happily fork over cash for yet another Harry Potter memento. Of course, this may be completely untrue, but with a Harry Potter play and a spin-off movie in the works, it seems to me that the powers that be are determined to squeeze every last drop of revenue from the series until it is truly bone dry.
That being said, I do think the project is worthwhile and exciting in many ways. I love Kay’s illustrations and cannot imagine anyone doing a better job. There is evidently so much love, patience and research put into every image that any true fan of the series will recognize one of their own in Hagrid’s ramshackle hut and Harry’s crowded cupboard under the stairs. At the end of the day, I don’t know whether this version of the series is going to be revolutionary, but as a true Harry Potter fan, I’m never going to argue with a new way to experience a book that defined my childhood and a generation.

After all, we’re the token demographic sympathetically short on cash — the poor student who brings home laundry to avoid the coin-operated washers, pays for sandwiches with a weekly allowance and is gifted envelopes from wealthier grandparents because, as our society kindly espouses, “kids need money.”
But kids aren’t the only ones guilty of this — so are philanthropic and community organizations which, from time to time, come to campus to solicit donations from the student body. Organizations such as Greenpeace and the American Civil Liberties Union have set up shop along Trousdale Parkway and ask passersby to contribute to their causes. Despite being barely effective, solicitation on campus, while distasteful, is ethical — and regulation really isn’t necessary.
There might be more of a ready pool of donors at USC than you would find at most college campuses. Students with families earning more than $200,000 are twice as numerous at USC as they are at UCLA, our crosstown rival. In addition to being a highly ranked university and composed of smart students, we also have a long list of incredibly active organizations composed of students that care. So, if an organization’s goal is to find funding, smart students who care might not be a bad place to start.
Of course, the smart students who care might not care that much on their way to class. Starting an online fundraiser, spreading the word through fliers, hosting events and manipulating the ready-made tools of social media outlets all serve as more effective means of raising money than simply posing the question, “Would you like to save the world?” to a student on a Penny board with one earbud in who would like nothing except to make it to Kaprielian Hall before 10 a.m.
More than anything, this method of solicitation is ineffective. The chances of being able to even stop someone on his or her way depends upon the aggressive behavior of the solicitor and the relative desperation of the solicited to get wherever they’re going — and generally, by this time in their lives — most people have learned to smile awkwardly and mumble “no thanks” or, more often, simply ignore them.
Many question whether students should be forced to perform this courtesy at all and argue that solicitation should be prohibited. However, it remains to be seen what is actually lost by allowing somebody, however aggressively positive they might be, to ask you if you love polar bears or if you want your grandchildren to see one. As long as the solicitor allows students to politely decline — and takes no for an answer without becoming brash, rude, intolerant or exceedingly aggressive — there seems to be no real damage done. Solicitors should be able to peddle all they want — they’re just not going to get anywhere. To be absolutely honest, the people who find themselves inextricably personally insulted by solicitation are probably more of a threat to campus than a solicitors.
However, as with any issue, there is room for compromise. A better solution would be to restrict solicitors to one specific area of campus — on one stretch of Trousdale or one corner of McCarthy Quad. That way, those who are explicitly bothered by solicitors might be able to better avoid them, and those looking to ask questions about or donate to certain organizations of their choice would know where to look.
Solicitation: It’s technically ethical, sometimes inconvenient and periodically effective, but most of all — let us collectively admit — generally unnoticeable.
A fun malapropism in Lily’s article: “There’s something uncouth about the image of assorted organizations peddling college students for money.”  I guess so, Lily! “Peddle” means to sell. So these “assorted organizations” are apparently acting as pimps!” Not what you meant to say, I know.

For the past decade, Los Angeles has been plagued with upsetting records of low voter turnout. When citizens fail to exercise their right to play a role in the electoral process, they forfeit their ability to criticize the process’s main working components. It’s been years, however, since California policymakers have truly taken a bipartisan initiative on increasing voter turnout. But the prospects of low turnout might change with the passage of AB 1461, the new Motor Voter Act, recently signed by Gov. Jerry Brown that allows Californians who sign up for driver’s licenses to have the option to be automatically registered to vote.
California will be the second state to opt into the automatic voter registration program. Because the program works in conjunction with Californians who obtain their driver’s license at the DMV, this could open the possibility for undocumented immigrants to partake in the voting process. Since undocumented immigrants have been allowed to obtain driver’s licenses since January, the new bill creates an open window for them to be automatically registered to vote and thus, to partake in the voting process. According to the NumbersUSA Education and Research Foundation, “they could be automatically registered to vote if the Secretary of State’s office fails to verify their eligibility accurately.”
The law’s goal is seemingly simple: Increase voter turnout without any sort of partisan ambition. But don’t be fooled. This very much hinges on policy initiatives led by the Democratic party.
A recent survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute revealed that 43 percent of the unregistered voters lean toward the Democratic Party. But whether or not these voters lean toward the Democratic party, and the fact that the bill was signed into law by a Democratic governor, is the not the issue at hand. This bill might change the course of our democratic process by allowing undocumented immigrants to partake in the policies that shape our great state.
Historically, voting rights have always been afforded to citizens. If we offer the opportunity for undocumented immigrants to take part in our voting system, the question then becomes to what measure can we still define citizens. The line between the rights afforded to citizens and undocumented immigrants has already been established — if we open the voting process to citizens of other countries, we will feel the impact of political influence and possibly a soar in political corruption.
Californians can smell inauthenticity. In order to increase voter turnout, politicians across party lines must work together for a nonpartisan initiative toward voter registration.
The presidential election — arguably one of the most important political elections — received considerably low voter turnout in California during the 2012 election. Only 49.8 percent of registered L.A. County residents voted in contrast to a whopping 76.8 percent during the 2008 election, according to the California Secretary of State’s Office. The pattern of low voter turnout in California has only gotten worse. Though the Motor Voter Act will produce larger numbers of registered voters, the act does not encourage constituents to turn out to vote and remain active in local, state, and nationwide politics. Secretary of State Alex Padilla recently took note of the limiting provision of the Motor Voter Act. Though Padilla supports its efforts, he explained that voting must become mandatory for all citizens. This, however, should be limited to citizens of the state.
“Citizens should not be required to opt-in to their fundamental right to vote,” Padilla said in a statement to reporters. “We do not have to opt in to other rights, such as free speech or due process.”
But Mr. Padilla, along with other proponents of the bill, fail to recognize that the specific formulations listed in the bill lack the necessary measures against safeguarding voting rights to citizens. Combining a very real issue in our state with the intent of accomplishing a partisan issue is the very reason why our state is suffering such low numbers of voter turnout.

C’mon, you know you love them. These are the songs that take you back to the days of VHS, Gameboys, Kid Pix, Bop It, awkward school dances, Blockbuster and book fairs. They roll back the years to a time before everyone had smart phones and still listened to music on Walkmans, CD Players and MP3s. Maybe they’ve been on your iTunes as your not-so-guilty pleasures that make you sing and smile at some memory they bring back whenever the first note hit. Or maybe these are the songs that have simply sat forgotten in the back of your mind for all these years. Whatever the case, here are my picks for the ultimate throwback playlist (with a few songs in Spanish for all my Latinos out there).
1990-1995
I don’t have many songs between the years of 1990 to 1995 because I wasn’t born yet, but I’m including some that managed to stick throughout the last half of the 90s. They include:
1996 – 2000
The latter half of the 90s and the early 2000s had some real gems as well. I’ll never forget dancing to “Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of…)” by Lou Bega as it played on the jukebox every Friday at a local pizza place close to where I lived. Here are the rest of the songs I always think of from around this time:
1996
1997
1998
1999
2000
2001 – 2006
2001
2002
2003
2004
2005

If you’ve been following along for the past six weeks, you know that we’ve talked about how chaotic this season has been. After this past week Trojan fans can attest to the fact that this season has been far from your typical season. But then again, is there ever a typical season in college football?
There are 16 remaining undefeated teams in FBS, but with matchups like Florida-LSU, Texas A&M-Alabama, Michigan-Michigan State, Northwestern-Iowa, the top 25 is going to look quite different once the dust settles Saturday night. It’s gonna be a chaotic weekend, but as my favorite football commentator John Madden likes to say, “usually the team that scores the most points wins the game”. Alright, let’s get to the games!
No. 18 UCLA at No. 15 Stanford (Spread: -16.5)
Stanford has had UCLA’s number, winning seven consecutive games in the series. Both teams have lost key players on defense and in particular, UCLA has had difficulty stopping the run, allowing 197 rushing yards per game. Stanford quarterback, Kevin Hogan, is 4-0 against UCLA and each time he’s beaten the Bruins, they’ve been ranked. It’s going to be a big game for Bruins quarterback Josh Rosen because Stanford’s front seven are going to make it tough for running back Paul Perkins to bail out UCLA’s offense, despite his solid performances throughout this season.
Our model favors Stanford, but with roughly equal teams like these two, as Trojan fans know, weird things can happen on Thursday nights.
No. 10 Alabama at No. 9 Texas A&M (Spread: 6)
Alabama beat Texas A&M by 59 points last season, and that score doesn’t accurately reflect how lopsided that matchup was last year.
But that was last year. This year Texas A&M is off to it’s second consecutive 5-0 start under head coach Kevin Sumlin. Texas A&M easily handled Mississippi State two weeks ago, had a bye week to prepare for a game they have been waiting for since the offseason (Interesting note: Alabama’s next three opponents will be teams coming off of bye weeks). Meanwhile Alabama is coming off a tough game versus Arkansas that was only decided in the fourth quarter.
Will Texas A&M’s front seven under defensive coordinator John Chavis be tough enough to stop Alabama’s running game? Our model favors Alabama to win, but this game is going to be a battle of the big guys with A&M’s front seven facing off against Alabama’s big, fast offensive line.
No. 7 Michigan State at No. 12 Michigan (Spread: -10.5)
Michigan State is 6-0 but didn’t score the winning touchdown until the final minute against Rutgers. Michigan State better believe that Michigan isn’t going to spike the ball at the end of the game to give them the win like Rutgers. No, folks, this one is going to be a tough one for Michigan State.
The Wolverines have posted three consecutive shutouts, and two of those games came against teams that were ranked. The last score allowed was to UNLV in garbage time when they were already up by four touchdowns. Michigan’s dominant defense is why both our model and Vegas have lower-ranked, one-loss Michigan as the favorite for this game.
Meanwhile, Michigan State’s only quality win was against Oregon, who’s not looking so hot right now, whereas Michigan’s only loss was against Utah who, in case you forgot, tore apart Oregon 62-20. It’s worth noting that three of the five teams Michigan has dominated defensively started freshman quarterbacks, and the other two were UNLV and Maryland. Spartan quarterback Connor Cook has put up 1334 passing yards and 12 touchdowns on the season, showing he is definitely no stranger to having big games. And if Michigan State is going to beat Michigan, he’s is going to need to have an amazing game against arguably the best defense in the country.
No. 8 Florida at No. 6 LSU (Spread: -19)
This one is going to be a tough one for Florida with freshman quarterback Will Grier suspended for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. LSU will be facing yet another backup quarterback, but ultimately it will be Florida’s defense that keeps them in this game. LSU running back Leonard Fournette will be facing a Gators run defense that has allowed less than 100 rushing yards per game. Against South Carolina, LSU was able to move the ball through the air because their receivers were able to get open against South Carolina’s corners. This weekend is going to be a very different story against Florida’s suffocating defense. If Florida can stack the box and stop Fournette and keep LSU from developing a passing game, they will likely be the guaranteed winner of the SEC East.
USC at No. 14 Notre Dame (Spread: -15)
The firing of Trojan head coach Steve Sarkisian has undoubtedly sent a jolt through the school and football program. This could either galvanize the team or deflate the team, and there’s no good way to tell which one it will be until Saturday.
On the bright side, the last time USC played for interim coach Clay Helton, we won against Fresno State in the Las Vegas Bowl. And USC’s first game after firing Lane Kiffin two years ago was a seven-point win over Arizona. It’s clear we are a program that knows how to respond to coaching adversity. If we are to continue this new-coach winning spree, Helton needs to let the Trojans run the ball, especially against Notre Dame’s defense, which has allowed 180 rushing yards per game. The Trojans’ defense is going to have to work extra hard with offensive lineman Max Tuerk out for the season.
This game will be a good game to watch (hopefully) as both teams are well-matched on paper, even if our model favors Notre Dame. Regardless of what happens this weekend at South Bend, I’ll be cheering our players on (definitely not booing) and I hope you all will be too.

Studying with Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) in Shanghai, I’ve learned the benefits of all-inclusive study abroad programs. CIEE offers many study abroad locations around the world, so even if USC doesn’t list a certain city as an option, you can probably apply through CIEE and request approval from USC. Here’s why I’m such a fan of CIEE, or at least CIEE Shanghai.
1. Tuition is significantly lower than USC’s tuition
Tuition costs certainly vary by city, but studying abroad in Shanghai only costs $14,774 for the semester. My parents were actually excited about me going abroad because it’s saving them so much money. In addition, the tuition fee covers way more than just tuition; it’s actually called a program fee because it covers tuition, housing, field trips, a visa and books. The only additional costs I incurred were airfare, insurance, food and local transportation.
2. Organized trips
So far I’ve only been on a weekend trip to Huangshan, a beautiful mountain range about seven hours outside of Shanghai. However, based on that trip, I can’t wait to spend a week in Sichuan hanging out with pandas as part of another CIEE trip. During my trip to Huangshan, I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. CIEE covered our transportation, housing, meals and activities for the entire weekend. For the program’s weeklong trips, which range from Taiwan to Hong Kong to the Silk Road to Sichuan, CIEE again takes care of everything. In addition, throughout the semester CIEE offers various all-inclusive field trips, including a Huangpu river cruise and a trip to the Shanghai Urban Planning Museum.
3. Full-time support
Whenever I have a question or need something, there is always someone from CIEE to help. Some staff members even double as RAs in the dorms. My residence permit actually arrived in the mail only two days before a Chinese national holiday, and CIEE made sure that I received it by personally delivering it to my dorm room.
4. Airport pick-up and drop-off
One of the best parts of this program, though seemingly insignificant, was the fact that there were buses waiting to take us to the dorms from the airport when we arrived, and they will have buses taking us to the airport when December rolls around. Nothing’s better than not having to worry about how to get a location in an unfamiliar city with all your luggage.
5. Small classes
Class size obviously depends on program enrollment, but CIEE Shanghai makes a concerted effort to keep classes small. My language class previously had 14 students, but CIEE deemed this unacceptable and split it into two sections. Additionally, area studies courses have a maximum of 25 students. Having small classes has been really beneficial in learning the language as well as getting to know professors and students in my classes.

The moment I strolled into Donut Friend last week, overwhelming nostalgia for Toy Story, one of favorite childhood movies, hit me. A colorful, welcoming mural on the wall together with a unique assortment of playfully-named donuts, greeted me. As we all know, the theme song of Toy Story kindly reminds us that “you’ve got a friend in me” — if by “friend” they meant a donut from Donut Friend, I think I’d be as happy as the time I found out there was going to be a sequel.
It was really hard choosing which donuts to try during this visit, but I finally settled on three, the first one being the “Mint Town” donut. This one immediately caught my attention because I am a fan of anything with chocolate and mint, and I’m happy to say it met my expectations. Typically, cake donuts tend to be rather dry, but the Mint Town donut was able to balance the texture with its mint cream filling.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
The second donut I tried was the “Hot Rosewater Music,” a confection of a lemon rosewater glaze and pistachios. Though eating this donut was not a life-changing experience for me, I think Donut Friend did an excellent job of combining two ingredients that are not commonly found in donuts.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Last, but certainly not least, I chose the “Yola Mango” donut. Even though it was very different from the donuts I’m used to eating, I was impressed with its use of chili, mango and lime zest, which are all ingredients that aren’t usually found in bakeries. The chili and lemon zest gave this donut a tropical kick, which I think some people wouldn’t appreciate, so it might be an acquired taste.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
If you’re looking for something traditionally sweet, however, I would recommend exploring another one of their many options. Donut Friend takes pride in their variety of flavors, which is why their motto is “Donuts done differently” — after all, they truly are. But if you’re still not satisfied with the selection they have to offer, you also have the option of creating a customized order in which you select a type of donut, a filling and toppings. For a lover of donuts and DIY projects, this is a dream come true. Cheers to ordering every variation possible! 
P.S. If you would like to take a look at all of their flavors, feel free to read through the menu on the store’s website and plan your trip to Donut Friend ahead of time.
Donut Friend is located at 5107 York Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90065, open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
