Slated for limited release on Friday, “Killer Kate” is a new horror movie co-produced and co-written by Elliot Feld and USC alumnus Daniel Moya. Moya graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts in 2017, where he studied film and television production, and Feld studied feature film production at the Brooks Institute.
The film focuses on Kate (Alexandra Feld), who attends her sister’s bachelorette party at a cabin booked on an Airbnb-style app. The weekend slowly turns into a vicious fight for survival as family members are pitted against each other. “Killer Kate” was showcased at four different film festivals in 2018, and received three awards, including best feature film at the Chicago Horror Film Festival.
In a phone conversation with the Daily Trojan, Moya provided insight into the making of “Killer Kate,” as well as his burgeoning film career.
Daily Trojan: What differentiates “Killer Kate” from other horror movies?
Daniel Moya: What we latched onto from the get-go [were] technological advances. There’s always this little worry of how secure it is. We were especially interested in the 24-hour news cycle, which is debilitating to people
We combined what passes for news and these technological advances, which seemed like a good place to start. People are riled up all the time, so I think they might relate to the anxiety of the characters’ motivations. Twenty-four-hour news is dangerous and cheapens what is actually of note in the news; it’s becoming oversaturated.
DT: How did you and Elliot’s tastes in film influence “Killer Kate?”
DM: “Killer Kate” was outside the box for me, but it was also fun to write. Elliot and I have almost opposite taste in movies, but value the same ideals. Our tastes complemented each other because we’d be throwing various ideas back and forth, and they’d go through our individual lenses. We don’t know who wrote which scenes anymore because there is a bit of both of us in each scene.
DT: Was there anybody at USC, whether it’d be a professor or student, who helped you develop your skills as a filmmaker?
DM: In film and television  production, three professors have equal standing: James Savoca, David Maquiling and Mary Posatko. 
Everyone from film school is coming from a different place artistically, and it can be stifling to complete something exactly how everyone else does because people have innately different ideas of what they want to do. 
Those three [professors] were honest when I did something badly and helpful when I did something outside the box. I learned the most when I followed my gut and failed. If I fucked up something I believed in, I could learn from their critiques. If I made things throughout film school that I didn’t believe in at all, I would’ve missed all that education. The benefit of film school is not the movies, but the people you make the movies with. The artistic benefit is trying your stuff, seeing what works and meeting people better than you at things you don’t know or like.
DT: Where do you see your career headed?
DM: I just like making things and don’t have a master plan. If you keep to this, I think people will start to watch. If they like it, you’re in a good place. You don’t know what’s going to be your big break. I’m not interested in making something I don’t like just to be known. I want it to be a dialogue between me and the audience.
If you like the movie, we have something in common because I make things from a personal place. If you’re true to what you want to do and you do it long enough, people eventually catch on. It happens sooner for some people than others, but you can’t forgo the work because the recognition will fade. Someone, somewhere, long after you’re gone, will stumble upon your movie, never having heard of you, and get to form their own opinion that you can’t control. To me, that’s exciting.

Based on the book by Sofie Cramer, “SMS für Dich” stars and was directed by Karoline Herfuth. The film follows Clara Sommerfeld as she mourns her late fiancé and searches for new ways to connect with him. (Photo from IMDb)
Members of the German Studies program gathered at the Taper Hall of Humanities Language Lab on Monday for the German Film Series’ showing of “SMS für Dich,” a romantic comedy directed by actress Karoline Herfurth.  
This event is one of many organized by the German Studies program, which seeks to introduce students to the art and work of individuals from German-speaking countries.  
Based on the novel by Sofie Cramer, “SMS für Dich” tells the tale of Clara Sommerfeld (Herfurth), a children’s author who has spent the last two years mourning her late fiancé. Since the car crash that took her husband’s life, Clara has been unable to write a manuscript that portrays a joyful and carefree protagonist, and she begins to fear that she will not be able to produce quality material until she recovers from her loss.  
Seeking a change of scene, Clara visits her friend in Berlin and unpacks her fiancé’s belongings. She discovers his cell phone, and begins to send texts to his number as an attempt to move on from his death. Little does she know that the number has been recycled and placed in the hands of a sports journalist, who is desperate to discover the source of the mystery messages.
“SMS für Dich” is just one of the movies showcased through the German Film Series, which serves to bring German culture to USC students in a way that is both entertaining and relevant.  
Ryan Myers, a freshman majoring in theatre, said the event intends to teach viewers about German media, culture and experiences.
“It is important that we embrace German culture because it can teach us more about our own,” Myers said.
This event created a comfortable atmosphere for students in introductory German classes and exposed listeners to colloquialisms such as “Die Liebe kennt kein Jein” or “Love knows no ‘maybe’” by bringing together the words for “yes” and “no” in the indistinct, indecisive “Jein.”  
Radhika Ananth, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said that the movie was “an incredible way for the German community to come together” in a casual setting.  
Movies in the German Film Series are played with English subtitles and are available to students in the German program as well as students who want to widen their horizons with film. 
“This one was lighter [than previous pieces shown in the series],” said Eve Lee, an assistant professor of German, who helped coordinate the event. Prior films have featured a historical theme, so “SMS für Dich” gives the German Film Series lineup a jovial, humorous tone, Lee said.  
The next film in the series, “In the Fade,” will be shown in the Taper Hall Language Lab at 4 p.m. on Nov. 13 and is open to all students.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark report on Oct. 8 that sounded a deafening alarm to the world: The time to act on climate change is now. 
The report reveals that if the world does not take action, temperatures are on track to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052, which is within the lifetime of most children and young adults. At an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world would experience drastic effects, including food and water shortages, droughts, wildfires, heat waves, rising sea levels and more hurricanes and flooding. 
The IPCC predicts that at such an increase, the world would lose 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs, which support over 25 percent of marine species and serve as coastal protection to nearly 900 million people. The world would experience significant climate migration as a number of areas grow uninhabitable. The report also said that limiting the temperature rise to just around 1.5 degrees Celsius would require a 45 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emission between 2030 and 2052.
The 2015 Paris Climate Accord aims to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to achieve a potential limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, the difference between a 1.5 degree rise and a 2 degree rise in temperatures is a dramatic one: Effects of climate change are severely worsened even with a half degree increase. 
The IPCC report compares effects at both levels: About 37 percent of the global population would experience extreme heat waves with a rise of 2 degrees, compared to around 14 percent at an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 411 million people around the globe would experience water scarcity compared to 350 million. With an increase of 2 degrees, 32 to 80 million people would be exposed to flooding from rising sea levels in 2100 compared to 31 to 69 million with a 1.5 degree increase. A warmer planet also means that a greater percentage of insects, plants and vertebrates would be lost. 
It is difficult to comprehend such large numbers, but it is important to recognize the weight of that devastation and loss, not to underestimate it. 
However, based on the current global pace, a 1.5 degree rise is inevitable without immediate and comprehensive transformation in the political, economic, social, cultural and natural arenas across the globe. Despite the drastic consequences the world faces unless significant changes are made, there remains a lack of political will to create these changes. In 2017, for example, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Accord, a landmark agreement within the United Nations to combat climate change.
The IPCC report is based on 6,000 scientific studies and the cooperation of 91 scientists from 40 countries specializing in the field. The committee is largely apolitical and the global scientists and researchers are dedicated to facts. However, climate change deniers and political adversaries still persist. 
Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a state which recently experienced unbelievable devastation from Hurricane Michael, is reported to have banned the terms “global warming” and “climate change” from state documents and discussions. Trump has claimed that “the concept of global warming was created by… the Chinese,” and called climate change “a hoax.” And even more concerning — despite facts, data and scientific consensus — is that some citizens have adopted the trite slogans and illogical denials of politicians.
Climate change is not a “red” or “blue” issue. Nor is it one that can be pushed aside as someone else’s problem. Climate change will affect Los Angeles and USC: Droughts, wildfires, rising sea levels and water shortages will become even more of a serious threat. By the end of the century, coastal counties, in which approximately 85 percent of California’s population reside, could face danger of flooding and damage worth $100 billion in property and infrastructure, according to the report. 
While some claim that the transformations required to mitigate climate change would be too expensive, the UN report concludes that in reality, inaction comes with a far greater price tag: An increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius could lead to $54 trillion in damage. 
The report states that global carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by 45 percent below 2010 levels and reach a net zero by 2050 ; public transportation and electric car usage should increase, the use of coal as an energy source must be terminated in the next 30 years, and usage of renewable energy sources must increase.  
USC must play its part in this move for change. As a renowned university that is home to a high-achieving and innovative faculty and student body, USC must serve as an example to the world. 
Although the University has sustainability initiatives in place, such as the Sustainability 2020 Plan, USC must do more to contribute to a more sustainable world. Compared to other top-ranking universities, USC has one of the youngest and smallest sustainability programs. The current Sustainability 2020 Plan outlines initiatives in energy and water conservation, waste diversion, greenhouse gas mitigation, sustainable transportation, sustainable procurement, and education, research and engagement in sustainability. 
Previous generations may have neglected climate change and postponed initiatives to ensure a sustainable world, but this one cannot afford to make the same mistakes. 
This generation must preserve and protect the planet, for they now have ownership of it. If politicians refuse to act, it is the children and young adults of today who will suffer the consequences in just a few decades. 
We, as the new stewards of Earth, must wake up to the climate change alarm, for the time to procrastinate has passed decades ago. We must demand action as if our future is at stake, because it is. For our children, our cities, our homes, and our quality of life, we must put pressure on representatives and elected officials to face the facts and act against political interests and potential economic profit.

The topic of sex might seem trivial, but everyone should be talking about a concept so pressing and relevant. Multiple factors are influencing this “hush hush” attitude surrounding sex such as fear, embarrassment or just simply a lack of information to even engage in such a conversation. Regardless of the reasoning, sex — including consent and safe practices — should be discussed continuously throughout the course of every young adult’s life. Sex education has the potential to decrease the stigma surrounding sex, better educate students on the impact of sex on their lives and ultimately can inform students on different ways to harbor safe, consensual and healthy sexual interactions. It is just as important as any other subject taught in school, and should be treated as such.
The problem of lack of knowledge begins and ends with school. In order to better analyze and address the problem of sexual assault and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases throughout high schools and universities, sex education must be prioritized in our education system.
In Los Angeles, the first time sex is introduced formally to students is typically in a middle school health class. In this course, teachers also discuss alcohol and drugs so that the sex education aspect of this course is lacking; it focuses not on the nuances of consent, but rather a rudimentary explanation of menstruation and awkward demonstrations of  how boys should apply condoms and also the reductive version of consent represented by the “no means no” maxim. Obviously that message is not clear enough given the unfortunate frequency of sexual assaults on and off campus.
In addition to this “health” course, comes the online course USC freshmen are required to take before class registration. However, this course is too basic, and students can easily click past all of the important information and take the childish quizzes at the end of each section without remembering a single lesson. Online courses are inadequate because they do not allow students to ask questions. Obviously this course is not very helpful in deterring sexual assaults and sexually transmitted infections, since they are still very frequent throughout universities globally. Moreover, there is no sexual education for the LGBTQ community in the course at USC, so LGBTQ students are even more disadvantaged when it comes to the topic of sex.
The glaring lack of sex education began in 2009 when the Los Angeles Unified School District cut sexual education out of high school curriculums due to lack of funding. The district claimed that in order for sexual education to be most effective, teachers would have to be trained to teach the topic better, which takes time and costs money. However, teachers routinely go to English, science and math workshops to better educate themselves on those topics, so it should be common sense to update curriculum on a topic such as health that is more useful to students. 
Former LAUSD superintendent Michelle King said in a 2009 Los Angeles Times interview that “single-sex education might attract more families to the district and improve student achievement.” However, this was only in reference to classrooms that aresame-sex, which is a sign of progress, but still not addressing the root of the problem of not teaching sex-ed at all. Furthermore, the other problem is that parents do not like the idea of a teacher instructing their child on such a sensitive topic. 
LGBTQ-inclusive sex education is met with a similar wariness. Some parents believe that if their child is in a sex education class that is inclusive of LGBTQ relationships, they might become confused about their own sexuality. Regardless, each classroom statistically has someone belonging to the LGBTQ community, and everyone should be equally educated, regardless of sexuality. 
No one knows enough about this important topic, which is only spreading the ignorance further into society. Important issues such as consent should be common knowledge, not something only taught to students online without any sort of effort.
Sexual education, especially when it focuses on issues of consent and identity, should be common knowledge, and treated as equal to other core subjects. To properly serve their students, school systems must revise their sexual education curricula and invest more in the crucial subject.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
The phrase “pivot to video” has been humorously — and bitterly — tossed around in media circles since 2015. Media publishers and newsrooms began investing in the growing trend of profitable video content, a move that signified a shift away from more traditional media of journalism, specifically articles and text-based storytelling. In other words, a new digital media landscape meant a modification in journalistic strategies and fundamentals: Scale back on time-consuming, investigative (and expensive) reporting; invest in snappy, profitable, short-form video that can be done on a relatively low budget.
The industry’s tendency to shift toward this supposedly “profitable” medium of journalism, one that depends on distributive social platforms like Facebook, was dangerously and irreversibly stupid. The decision was purely economic and based on observed, unsupported trends, but disguised as a strategy for improved audience engagement. Instead, publishers should have sought to invest in long-term growth of meaningful multimedia and interactive journalism. While there is a need for better distribution and audience engagement with newsroom content, the snappy one-minute video is a sloppy, quick fix for an industry that has struggled to thrive in an evolving digital landscape. 
An emphasis on short-form video not only devalues traditional forms of journalism, but also long-form, deep-dive documentary work. It sends a message that fast, easy and quick bits of content — whether it be aggregated news articles or short videos — should be prioritized in the newsroom, rather than serve as an economic supplement. This ultimately does more harm than good to the quality of content produced by the industry.
Last Wednesday, a class action lawsuit brought on by a group of advertisers alleged that Facebook had overestimated users’ average video watch time by 150 to 900 percent, an issue the company hid from users and publishers, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The case drew attention from journalists, publishers and industry professionals, as most journalists unremittingly criticized the social platform for falsely pushing a “pivot to video” narrative perpetuated by gullible publishers. The trend, they alleged, spurned massive layoffs of writers and traditional journalists, as newsrooms sought to invest in social media staffers and short-form video producers. And as Facebook took back its promise for a visual future (“There will be less video,” Facebook’s head of news feed said in January), newsrooms like Vox, Refinery29 and New York Daily News scaled back their social teams in an unprecedented digital pullback. 
Publishers have been quick to note that their decision was not based on Facebook’s emphasis on video at all in another WSJ report. Why would they completely shift their newsroom strategy to accommodate the most popular distributive platform they funnel their work onto? Because the journalism industry’s entire business model is rooted in advertising dollars, especially when content distribution is tied to social media platforms. 
Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if Facebook or publishers are to blame for the pivot to video phenomenon. What matters is whether or not publishers and newsroom leaders will change the industry’s current course without firing and rehiring journalists who specialize in a variety of different skills. I’m not arguing that video skills aren’t crucial to a modern newsroom; in fact, a state-of-the-art newsroom should invest in journalists with unique specializations, skills and beats to create a well-rounded product for audiences of all ages and interests.
This pivot to video dream embraced by publishers is truly infuriating and reckless.
I’m angry that the media industry has temporarily thrown away the most basic and fundamental reporting skills necessary for good journalism for something more economically innovative. I’m angry that for most of my journalism education, I was told that the future is digital, that print readership and news was dying and that no one reads the Daily Trojan. I’m angry that hard working journalists with crucial beats were laid off from their jobs because the industry felt that time-consuming, door-knocking, on-the-ground reporting should be valued less because it doesn’t offer anything visually exciting.
Terry Nguyen is a junior majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the digital managing editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Digitally Yours,” runs every other Wednesday.

Antonio Soria spotted the scalper standing in the middle of Trousdale Parkway as he surveyed footage. At first glance, nothing in the frame seemed suspicious, but Soria knows how to find the needle in the haystack. 
“Have you ever seen, for example, a group of ants? All of them are traveling one way,” said Soria, who works for the Department of Public Safety. “Put an object around it. They’ll go crazy, because they’re trying to avoid it.” 
To Soria, the ants are fans on their way to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 13, and the “object” is the scalper, a person who illegally re-sells tickets for that evening’s game. And he’s right — it’s obvious that the fans heading to the game are avoiding him.
Soria works in the Unified Command Center, a building just east of campus where multiple law enforcement offices assemble for every event at the Coliseum. Each department is here for a specific, different reason: The California Highway Patrol has jurisdiction over state property like Exposition Park, the Los Angeles Fire Department handles medical emergencies and the FBI handles general large-scale emergencies. DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department deal with minor threats and criminal infractions at each game.

Of the 33 biggest football schools in the country, Sports Illustrated ranked USC 22nd for gameday safety, with an average of 20 incidents per gameday last year. But unlike most universities, USC shares its stadium with a professional team, and USC is located in the second-largest city in the United States, making the campus and surrounding area more susceptible to crime. 
As far as DPS Chief John Thomas knows, USC’s surveillance collective is the only one of its kind among Pac-12 schools. 
“In the event that something happens, all of the entities that will be first responders to an incident are right here,” Thomas said.
Bob Green, formerly the LAPD Operations-South Bureau commanding officer, brought the command center model to USC five years ago. He modeled the system after the National Response Plan, which the federal government describes as “a guide to how the Nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies.”
“The whole rationale is to build relationships between all the first responders and have a plan before an incident happens so we can help [prevent] and predict potential problems,” Green said. 
Around 30 law enforcement officers are involved in the operation that takes up a single, slightly crowded room. Two projection screens showing CCTV footage line the front wall behind a desk with two monitors. Various maps of the Coliseum and campus decorate the walls and tables, along with a television playing TMZ on the screen in the corner.
Considering the influx of people on campus, the tone of the room is noticeably calm. Elizabeth Carreño, the DPS community relations manager, even studies in her spare time. But the room’s collective ability to act procedurally is not by chance. Many of the people in the room have been working in the UCC since its inception in 2013.
“We know each other very well and we’re constantly communicating,” said CHP Lieutenant Adam Smith. “And that’s helped with the activity of the command center.”

The eye of the storm
The heart of the operation lies in the hands of Soria, the DPS surveillance operations manager. He stands at the front of the room, scrolling through around 40 of the nearly 3,000 cameras positioned on and around campus, looking for inconsistencies and common problems.  
Almost every officer in the room cited intoxication as the primary concern — 40 percent of incidents on game days last season were alcohol-related, according to the Sports Illustrated report. And the UCC is accustomed to seeing fans stumble around campus on the CCTV screens. 
At one point after kickoff, the room observed a fan who appeared intoxicated as he made his way to a bench near Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, accompanied by two women.
“The whole rationale is to build relationships between all the first responders and have a plan before an incident happens.” — Bob Green, former LAPD Operations-South Bureau commanding officer
“He’s got the wobbles!” one officer called out. When the man approached the end of the sidewalk, another officer yelled, “Get him out of the street!” 
DPS eventually deployed two CSC workers to help the man, at which point Soria moved on to a different CCTV transmission.
But on this day, heat and alcohol-induced emergencies were not as prevalent as they typically are, Thomas said. Instead, Soria and other officers noticed scalpers and vendors on campus. Some were selling hot dogs, but others broke trademark laws by hawking unauthorized USC gear.  
“Our response next time will be to increase enforcement of that and possibly even having individuals from another entity, ABC or trademark licensing, doing some undercover stuff to be more effective,” Thomas said.
Listen to “The Other Gameday Playbook” on Spreaker.
Along with the UCC, two other command stations can zoom and swivel the CCTV cameras: one next to the DPS headquarters on McClintock Avenue, the other inside the Coliseum. But Soria has primary authority, giving him the ability to override the other two centers if he needs to control the image. With this ability he has seen some things on the cameras that sound like they belong in an episode of “Punk’d.” 
He once caught a man peeing in the stands of a soccer game at the Coliseum, completely unaware of the camera behind him. 
“And then he finally turns and looks at the camera and they all started laughing, kind of like, ‘No one’s looking, right,’” Soria said. “And then of course we put that information down because he had done that. [Officers] went out there, and they escorted him off the Coliseum.”
The ins and outs
Linda Sandefur is an LAPD dispatcher for the Coliseum, but on game days she is also a liaison between the Coliseum and UCC. She said that because not everyone is on the same radio network, her job is to relay information for incidents that affect multiple departments. 
Sandefur recalled an incident last year when law enforcement stopped a man who ran into the Coliseum with a knife.
“We had to work with everybody,” Sandefur said. “The outside people knew that he was coming, they had a description, but they had to try to get ahold of him.” 
She said everyone inspected the camera footage while she followed radio transmissions until FBI agents caught the suspect by chance.
But save for a few exceptions, UCC typically manages traffic in and out of the Coliseum, including getting over 300 members of the Trojan Marching Band into the stadium about an hour before kickoff. 
The L.A. Department of Transit blocks cars from turning onto Exposition Boulevard, and the county’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority cuts off light rail service as the band members cross the street. 
Tyler Dixon, an LAFD captain, said that this UCC has become a model for other command centers in the L.A. area. 
“About two or three years ago, we had the first Los Angeles fleet week,” Dixon said. “The model for the unified command post for that event used this command post as the best practice.”
He said the center was also an example for the Special Olympics a few years ago, and that the 2028 Olympics will use the same model. 
Former Incident Commander Bob Green said that UCC is also beneficial for building relationships during pre-planned events so that first responders have common terminology for unplanned ones. 
“It’s a very structured way to do business and it’s proven its worth,” Green said.

Last month, sophomores Chris Hailey and Armand Sarkisian connected over their interest in financial technologies. From there, they launched Fintech Innovation Group on campus for financial technology enthusiasts to convene, innovate and network. 
Under the guidance of Anthony Borquez, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship, FIG aims to develop industry events, group projects and community outreach opportunities for its members. 
“I think this club is important because it shows how we’re continually evolving as a university,” Borquez said. “We’re staying relevant in emerging technology trends that are happening in the industry, and we’re showing a collaboration on how faculty and students could come together and provide solutions and be able to expand this industry with our collective partnering.” 
Fintech covers payment technologies, financial services and algorithmic trading, according to Hailey, the president of FIG. He developed his passion for Fintech this past year, but noticed a lack of community at USC. 
“I know a lot of people who are in finance, I know a lot of people who are in technology but this is my chance to bridge the two together,” Hailey said. 
After Hailey posted in a student group on Facebook, Sarkisian, who is majoring in business administration, contacted Hailey, a computer science major. 
“We’re both pretty passionate about [financial technology] so it combines pretty well,” Sarkisian said. “We’ll be prepared to take on clients within the community and offer them fintech consultancy solutions. This will be anything from suggesting potential sources of financing all the way to developing a dynamic fintech platform that might solve some kind of unique problem for them.”
Once they met, they approached Borquez, the founder of multiple firms including Grab, Blue Label Games and Spacient Technologies. Borquez currently teaches a business entrepreneurship course on creating a tech start-up, covering financial technologies and services in the curriculum. 
“I was excited because once we see these type of student organizations start to take initiative, it’s a sign that this is something we need to be doing at USC,” Borquez said. “This is something the students are interested in. I think it also matches with the trends we see happening and evolving in the industry right now.”
Borquez said he will be providing guidance and will bring in educational speakers and companies hiring interns and full-time staff. During the process of connecting with different companies in the industry, FIG is scheduled to host four guest speakers in the future, including professionals from digital currency exchange platform Coinbase. 
While there are Marshall School of Business organizations that offer business consulting and Viterbi School of Engineering programs that offer project-based technology, there’s nothing that shares the two, according to Sarkisian.
“A lot of students are excited about what’s in between,” Sarkisian said. “Because that’s where all of these new ideas are coming from, this interdisciplinary, polymathic study. We created this club to fill that gap.”

When Edwin Juarez Rosales and Sergio Avelar attended the beatification of Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador in 2015, they were overwhelmed. The Salvadoran Catholic advocate for human rights would become a saint within their lifetime.
Three years later, just as they had hoped, Pope Francis canonized Romero, drawing thousands of Catholics and Salvadorans to Vatican City — Juarez and Avelar among them. At 4 a.m. on Oct. 14, the morning of the canonization, the two USC alumni lined up outside St. Peter’s Square in anticipation of the moment when Romero, Pope Paul VI and five others would officially be elevated to sainthood.
“For the honor of the Blessed Trinity, the exaltation of the Catholic faith and the increase of the Christian life…” Pope Francis said in Latin as he recited the canonization formula and addressed the tens of thousands who gathered in St. Peter’s Square later that morning.
Juarez and Avelar stood in white and blue among the crowd, overcome by prayer and emotion as they heard Romero’s story recounted and reflected on the life of the martyr who was shot in 1980 by the military government while giving mass in San Salvador.
During his life, Romero advocated for the people of El Salvador. He stood against the violence in his country and denounced the persecution of those around him, despite fear for his safety. Following his death and years of stalling, Romero is now a saint, 38 years later. 
“There’s always a moment in which it hits you — that you are there at this historical place in this moment in history that will not repeat,” Juarez said. “I mean, the first saint from my country was being proclaimed and acknowledged as someone that the whole world should look up to.”
Both Juarez and Avelar grew up learning about Romero and his teachings. Juarez’s parents attended his funeral mass in 1980 and encountered the vocation of social justice through his homilies and actions, Juarez said. As Salvadoran Catholics, both Juarez and Avelar consider Romero part of their identity.
“Being [at the canonization, there’s] this sense of pride that, to be honest, you don’t always feel as an immigrant in the United States from El Salvador,” said Juarez, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador at age 18. “My country is not on the news for these kinds of things … being there for something that is just good … We can say, yes, this guy — he’s also from El Salvador just like me. He’s receiving the highest honor a person can receive.”
Juarez and Avelar began searching for flights immediately after the Vatican announced the canonization in May. Months later, they arrived in Rome from Los Angeles the Saturday afternoon before the canonization. Throughout Rome, rosaries, stamps, magnets and other trinkets imprinted with the face of Romero lined the streets and shops, Avelar said.
“I think this brings a lot of hope,” he said. “At the time that Romero was assassinated, it was a dark time in the country’s history. After that, the civil war started and then now the country’s facing similar types of violence because of gangs … This brings some light of hope that the violence can hopefully be stopped again and there can be peace brought to the country.”
The day after the canonization, Juarez and Avelar attended a mass held in thanksgiving by members of the church and cardinals, bishops and priests from El Salvador, after which the pope greeted those in attendance. Though fewer Salvadorans were able to attend the canonization in Vatican City than the beatification in San Salvador, Avelar said he was proud that it took place at the universal church, demonstrating Romero’s lasting impact on more than El Salvador.
“Everyone knows about him, knows who he was, knows what he stood for, what he believed,” he said. “Many people now, even who aren’t Catholic — he sort of just transcends outside of Catholic circles …. He did what he could to stand up for basic human rights, especially for the poor people. That transcends religion, race and all these other labels.”

Amid the upcoming midterm elections, it’s easy to lose sight of local politics. It’s easy to think of our representation as centralized to Washington, D.C., but every other year, California ballots carry votes that do more than merely choose representatives — they decide residents’ rights. The list of propositions on the ballot, now 11 entries long, each hold the power to affect Californians’ daily lives — and one of the most impactful propositions is Prop 10.
Proposition 10, commonly referred to as the “Rent Control Initiative,” tackles one of the largest social issues in Los Angeles: affordable housing. It would address the fact that even people who have lived here all their lives can’t afford rent by allowing cities to expand rent control policies to more buildings and protecting tenants from excessive rent hikes on privately owned properties. Prop 10 would give cities more freedom to decide how to implement rent control, and should be passed not only because of its possible effects on affordable housing, but also because it would better address the issue of housing in a state as large and diverse as California.
While many students’ rent prices are stabilized by the University, the sheer lack of affordable housing affects both students and local community members who live in non-university housing. Residents of  Exposition Boulevard, Flower Street and countless other neighborhoods throughout South L.A. have been evicted due to rising rent costs, which are outrunning the median income increase and inflation. According to the California Housing Partnership, the median rent in Los Angeles County has increased 32 percent in the last two decades while median renter household income has decreased by 3 percent. Those who can’t afford rent are sometimes forced to live on the streets, contributing to Los Angeles’ growing homeless population.
Prop 10 is under scrutiny from both sides regarding its efficacy in reducing homelessness, increasing affordable housing and solving L.A.’s housing crisis. But contrary to criticism from advertisements and rebuttals, Prop 10 would not change any local rent control laws. Rather, it would repeal a past law and give the community the opportunity to decide “a landlord’s right to establish and increase rental rates on a dwelling or housing unit.”
The central provision of this proposition is the repeal of the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which regulated rent control. The act essentially prevented state rent control on apartment complexes constructed after 1995, and stopped local governments from controlling rent on all single family homes.
In 2009, Costa-Hawkins was used to defend developers in court, and they were not required to create affordable housing within their developments.Locally, Costa-Hawkins has become outdated as L.A.’s population grows and more measures to create affordable housing are being taken.
Economically, Prop 10’s creation of rent caps would create a shortage of money for landlords. Landlords would not be able to charge a rent they find fair, and  could end up selling or not renting out their property. Dwindling supply would yield a surge in collective prices, and the rent cap would become pointless. But the shift in responsibility to the local government to establish rent control creates a solution for communities to address their specific needs. Los Angeles has the second-highest homeless population with only 8 percent of houses sold this year in Los Angeles considered “affordable.” The responsible application of Prop 10 would ideally keep rent low but allow both landlord and renter to mutually benefit.
There has been a slight decrease in homelessness (4 percent) thanks to L.A.’s 2016 Proposition HHH, which allocated $1.2 billion in bonds to go to creating 10,000 supportive housing units for the homeless, and Measure H, an estimated $350 million annually through sales tax to go toward fighting homelessness. But these measures could be accelerated by the passage of Prop 10, which would ensure the maintenance of affordability, stabilizing longer term solutions.
It’s understandable that cities with less dire housing situations do not want additional legislation to control their rent decisions. But with such a large homeless population, Angelenos must think about housing issues now. As the housing market changes, local governments must understand how it affects their community and should take action. Passing Prop 10 is the only way to do that, and the only way to ensure its passage is to show up to vote yes on Nov. 6.

Monday was the last day to register to vote for the midterm elections in California. For months, USC students have been encouraged to take steps to register to vote; there have been registration events, countless emails and posters hung around campus. Hopefully, it has had some impact. 
But registering to vote is just the first and, frankly, the easiest step in the display of citizenship. 
As U.S. citizens, we must all take this responsibility seriously and act accordingly on Nov. 6. But the real display of citizenship goes far beyond merely voting; it is about making informed decisions of who and what to vote for in each particular race. A true citizen is not swayed by political advertisements or the popularity of a candidate. Although they certainly might take such factors into account, ultimately, truely responsive citizens research candidates and their platform points for themselves. One should not vote for a candidate because they identify as a Republican or as a Democrat. The voting process is only truly democratic when citizens base their decisions on candidates’ platforms, rather than personality and party.
It’s essential for voters to examine what positions they value and the hierarchy of issues most important to them. However, it’s virtually impossible for one candidate to embrace every socially important issue. 
I encourage voters to endorse ideas, rather than candidates. Don’t value positions because a candidate offers them; instead, value candidates because they take certain stances. 
At the end of the day, it’s vital to discuss these policies, not only with with those who agree with you, but also with the individuals who prioritize issues differently and who oppose you on an issue. Too often, people associate themselves with friends who share similar political beliefs, and are inclined to unfriend (sometimes in real life, sometimes on Facebook) those who disagree. It’s important to remember that political beliefs can be separated from individuals’ personalities and relationships with their peers. 
I encourage political discussion that breeds discomfort. This discussion should be challenging and exercise the necessity to maintain your beliefs while under scrutiny from those who disagree. Most importantly, it’s crucial to have an open mind. Do not be ashamed of changing your position on certain issues because engaging in a policy debate rooted in stubbornnes does nothing and helps no one. Having an open mind will help you refine your position, and help you look at something from an entirely new perspective. 
As we approach Nov. 6, I implore every reader to think about how long they spent researching the issues and candidates on their respective ballot before they share their “I voted!” stickers online. Have they spent more time researching candidates for the upcoming election or reading this column? If the answer isn’t the former, then they should reconsider their priorities as American citizens.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
So rarely does the art world make international headlines, I would be remiss not to share my thoughts on Banksy’s now-infamous Oct. 5 stunt: publicly and purposefully shredding an iconic painting that sold for $1.4 million. The exact moment the Sotheby’s auctioneer’s gavel slammed, “Girl With Balloon” passed through a shredder hidden in its frame, rendering its lower half mangled and protruding from the bottom. 
In a three-minute short film titled “Shred the Love,” Banksy revealed documentation of the meticulously calculated prank that resulted in the one of the most epic metaphorical middle fingers to commercialism that he has ever pulled off. 
In the same video, Banksy refuted torrents of conspiracies surrounding whether the painting had really been shredded by including an epilogue in which his masked team members carry out a successful test run of the frame’s mechanism in the artist’s studio. Through this, he sent the world a shocking clarification: The frame mechanically malfunctioned and the entire work was supposed to have been destroyed.
“Some people think it didn’t really shred. It did,” one of Banksy’s Instagram captions reads. The video proclaimed: “In rehearsals it worked every time…” 
These newfound revelations hardly detract from Banksy’s well-known penchant for publicity stunts or erase the fact that the million-dollar painting was irreparably shredded. Even the frame has become a relic of the age of oversaturated media and capitalism Banksy so openly condemns. 
Splashed across front pages and homepages, the affront Banksy inspires in a post-truth society seems extraordinary. Videos from the auction room show Sotheby’s patrons, employees and onlookers wide-eyed, gaping-mouthed, leaping to their feet in awe, bearing paralyzed expressions. 
But for those of us familiar with Banksy’s work, his latest brazen performance is hardly uncommon for contemporary art’s most notorious provocateur. It signals the artist’s comeback to the public consciousness and proves the futility of his consistent attempts to alienate himself from art and its markets. 
In late 2000s London, an anonymous street artist by the moniker Banksy exploded onto the arts scene to critical acclaim — all at once, he was a populist icon for his signature stencil style and a sellout for dominating auctions emblematic of the very capitalist abuses his art censured. 
Along with reviving graffiti and grassroots activism, Banksy’s success has triggered discourse about how the art world arbitrarily assigns intellectualism and value. To this day, despite having his iconography littered across gritty urban walls globally and being named one of the world’s most influential people, Banksy’s identity remains unknown (he supplied a photo of himself with a paper bag over his head to Time Magazine) and central to his widespread appeal. 
When I saw Banksy’s works at the Modern Contemporary Museum in Amsterdam, I couldn’t help but think that they looked wrong exhibited in chaste, orderly gallery spaces instead of strewn across sidewalks, T-shirts and cheap prints. Banksy’s iconoclasm is not meant to be experienced within traditional confines, yet his subversion is exactly what makes him so valuable in commercial markets. 
Whether consciously or self-consciously, Banksy has become a paradox, implicit in his own commerciality and made to fit a mold he has always rejected. In reality, with all the collectors invested in him, it’s pointless for Banksy to try to outrun his commercial shadow. Without the endless flow of money he allegedly despises, he would be nothing. 
As Banksy surely knows, the art market cannot be undone by an elaborate shredder prank. On the contrary, I think he’s outgrown and outsmarted all us. Perhaps he long ago abandoned the rebellious pipe dream on which he built his brand and has been subtly exploiting the art world by masquerading as its mortal enemy, its most vehement critic.
 At the very least, he certainly anticipated that the painting’s value would climb to a projected $4 million, and the unnamed buyer would wind up with, as they put it, their “own piece of art history.” 
The structures of the art world are so inextricable from artists themselves that we’ve seen this archetype play out before; Marcel Duchamp put a literal urinal on display as a critique of museums’ high-mindedness and inadvertently pioneered the movement of the readymade art object.
 And now, with Banksy, we again see an artist launch a potentially destabilizing examination only to be embraced and glorified by the very art market he vilifies.
Already, the market has evolved and adapted to accommodate Banksy’s revolution. Sotheby’s has since released a statement stating the tattered painting was renamed “Love Is in the Bin” and marks the first time an artwork was “created live at auction.” The Paris auction house slated to sell his prints next have even expressed hope that a similar stunt will transpire. Ultimately, the art world has continually proved its virtual immunity to denunciations, meaning people like Banksy have been either shouting into the void or long since absorbed into the machinery of the market. I don’t know which one is worse but win or lose, Banksy is out to create art history and he’s unstoppable.

On the verge of kicking off his “American Alien” tour, Abhi The Nomad remains passionate about representing his culture in hip-hop. (Photo courtesy of Levi Thompson)
Austin-based hip-hop artist Abhi The Nomad started making music when he was just 13 years old. When he started recording himself a year later, he claims he wasn’t really good. Rather, it took a lot of time and effort to get inspired and come into his own music in the last few years — a development he cites as being “more invested in [his] art than anything else in life.” 
Abhi The Nomad’s style ranges from fast-paced hip-hop, to funkier R&B songs, as evidenced in singles like “Run” and “Booty.” Although he explores different genres across his music, he likes to define his sound as a form of alternative hip-hop.
“I like exploring different styles, but I’m coming into my own in the sense that I think what I make is alternative hip-hop,” Abhi said. “I think it’s like hip-hop mixed with different styles. Obviously, ‘Run’ and ‘Booty’ sound more rap-centric as opposed to the other ones, but I think that’s just an exception.”
He sees his sound getting darker and more intense, something fans will begin to hear in the next year as he tries to distance himself from a more sugary, accessible style of music. Now, the 24-year-old artist is looking forward to exploring moodier territories.
“The thing is, I’m getting sick of the last album, which was something so bubbly,” Abhi said. “You know the word for what it is at the time but I think I kind of want to explore a little more intense dark atmospheres and I’d like go down that route.” 
Abhi derives his inspiration from the artists he currently listens to. These influences range from the new Lupe Fiasco album to Logic’s rapid-fire rapping style. Abhi’s funkier side comes out as he explains that his ideal collaboration would be with artist Anderson .Paak. 
“I feel like Anderson .Paak would make the most sense, honestly,” Abhi said. “I don’t know know — if I wanted to collab with someone it wouldn’t be like on my new song.”
After dropping his LP “Marbled,” Abhi used his last two singles, “Run” and “Booty,” to show off his rapping talents as he spit bars over fast-paced, bouncy beats. 
“I feel like after dropping an album that’s super emotional, marbled and super introspective and all that shit. I kind of needed some space to just bar out, rap my ass off and just be technical about music,” Abhi said.
Currently, Abhi is kicking off the West Coast leg of his “American Alien” national tour. Abhi is also passionate about creating better Indian representation in hip-hop. He believes it is important that people of his background see someone representing them on stage. 
“I look closer to what they look like than their friends,” Abhi said. 
He believes that his unlikely presence in the hip-hop genre can inspire confidence in other Indians to pursue their passions, whatever they may be. In fact, he says he would love to see more Indian rappers pick up a mic and try their hand at making hip-hop music. He also says that he wishes more people like him would try playing music of any kind. He hopes that, if he is to serve as inspiration for anyone, others will learn to be proud of their heritage and where they came from.
All the support he’s received for his album and tour have been the most rewarding part of his career. It is this love from his fans that is pushing him to create more music, Abhi said. 
“It should be about my music,” Abhi said. “Nothing else really matters.”
Abhi The Nomad will perform at the Moroccan Lounge on Oct. 24. His new single “Booty” is available on all major music platforms.

On Saturday, Los Angeles-based band Slow Hollows took the stage at The Troubadour in West Hollywood to an energetic crowd complete with a mosh pit. (Photo from Instagram)
On Saturday night, Slow Hollows filled The Troubadour with a crowd comprising mostly energetic, artsy teenagers. The Los Angeles-based indie rock band gained a larger following in the past year after collaborations with Brockhampton’s Kevin Abstract for its “Lessons For Later” music video, and  providing guitar on both Frank Ocean and Tyler, The Creator’s recent albums. 
The band has taken advantage of its hometown’s vibrant music scene thus far, having previously performed at local DIY venues. Gearing up to release its third album, Slow Hollows played a variety of tunes from its discography.
Though Slow Hollows’ music could be described as relaxed and lowkey, the crowd came ready to mosh. Throughout the set, a consistent group of about 40 fans kept the pit alive, with the rest of the crowd looking on in awe. When the tempo slowed, the pit transformed into a giant wave with patrons swaying back and forth.
Opening with “The Art School Kids,” Slow Hollows immediately ignited the crowd and set the tone for the evening. From the ever-present mosh pit to light sways, fans danced the night away to the band’s soundtrack.
Trumpeter Daniel Fox played a crucial role in the set, always hitting the right note to amplify the song. The combination of Fox’s brassy tones and lead singer Austin Feinstein’s sweet vocals created a distinct elegance in every single song.
There was little room for stage banter, with Feinstein chiming in once every few songs to thank everyone for coming or to introduce a new song.
Fans were pleased to hear classics like “Romantic” and “Again,” as well as the band’s recent single “Selling Flowers,” live for the first time. Slow Hollows gave fans a taste of its upcoming album by playing a few unreleased songs, including “Come Back In” and “Young Man.”
Guitarist Aaron Jassenoff picked up the pace in “Spirit Week” and maintained his high energy with plenty of head bobbing. The band also balanced the crowd’s energy between their more upbeat songs with slower songs.
After the band returned for a two-song encore, the crowd’s energy peaked. Toward the end of the set, Feinstein teased the crowd with a short stage dive before quickly returning to the stage. When the night came to a close, Slow Hollows had all but guaranteed its place in the L.A. music scene. The band’s next local show is at Camp Flog Gnaw, Tyler, The Creator’s annual music festival, which takes place Nov. 10 and 11 at Dodger Stadium.

With two injured USC quarterbacks, redshirt freshman Jack Sears may start under center against Arizona State on Saturday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Trojans’ quarterback situation may be in a state of crisis coming out of their loss against Utah on Saturday, with freshman starting quarterback JT Daniels forced to leave the game with a possible concussion and redshirt sophomore backup quarterback Matt Fink diagnosed with broken ribs. 
Daniels had been struggling in the game before a hard hit during a late third quarter intercepted throw knocked him out of the game. 
Fink played well in his place, completing six of seven passes for 43 yards and a touchdown, along with rushing for 21 yards. So, he took a number of tough shots on those carries, leading to a postgame diagnosis of broken ribs that ruled him out for next week.
Reports from Monday indicate that Daniels has cleared the first part of concussion protocol; he’s expected to be available to play in Saturday’s game against Arizona State. He’s still going through concussion protocol and has not yet been cleared to practice.
With Fink out for the foreseeable future, redshirt freshman Jack Sears will be handling first team responsibilities in practice this week. Sears has been third on the quarterback depth chart all season and has yet to throw a pass in a game as a Trojan. If an unexpected turn holds Daniels out for Saturday, he will get his chance.
Sears’ style of play is very different from that of Daniels and Fink, and he easily has the biggest arm on the team. He was responsible for some of the Trojans’ biggest plays downfield throughout training camp. 
He is less mobile than both Daniels and Fink and has a tendency to leave the pocket quickly in the face of pressure. His accuracy can be inconsistent at times, and he’s displayed a habit of occasionally holding on to the ball too long. But because Sears has only played in practice and camp, there’s no way to tell what a Sears-led offense will look like until he starts throwing passes in a live game.
As of now, all signs still point to Daniels starting against ASU. However, if he can’t play or gets injured again, Sears will step in. It’s a situation worth monitoring throughout the remainder of the week as the Trojans look to rebound from Saturday’s loss and keep their 19-game home win streak intact.

Sophomore driver Marko Vavic netted his 100th career goal on Sunday. He has scored 49 goals this season. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
The No. 1 USC men’s water polo took down two ranked opponents last weekend: No. 8 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 6 Pepperdine on Sunday. 
On Saturday, the Trojans produced the first five scores of the game, shutting out the 49ers for the entire first period in the 13-6 win. With just under five minutes left in the first half, Long Beach State got on the scoreboard, but USC quickly answered back with redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong’s second goal of the day. After an ensuing goal from the 49ers, the Trojans answered 22 seconds later — this time with a goal by senior driver Zach D’Sa, his third of the day. 
Long Beach State closed the gap to 7-4 in the third period, but not for long as USC posted 5 more goals, including one from freshman driver Hannes Daube to beat the third quarter buzzer. The 49ers managed to score 2 final goals in the fourth quarter but were never able to challenge the Trojans’ command of the game. Freshman goalie Nic Porter anchored the defense with six saves in the victory. 
“[The team] did a lot of preparation for Long Beach because they’re not a top four team, but they’re one of those teams that if you take lightly they could get you,” sophomore driver Marko Vavic said.
On Sunday, Vavic scored his 100th career goal and was one of 12 Trojans to score in the 17-6 victory over Pepperdine. 
USC started off hot with goals from freshman two-meter man Jake Ehrhardt and sophomore driver Jacob Mercep. Pepperdine eventually answered to get on the board. The match stayed close at 2-1 for the majority of the first period. In the final minute of the quarter, the Trojans kicked into gear with 2 goals to go up 4-1. The Trojans’ rally continued with goals from sophomore driver Sawyer Rhodes, junior 2-meter Matt Maier, redshirt junior 2-meter Sam Slobodien, junior driver Marin Dasic and Vavic to extend their lead to 9-1.  
The Waves responded with one 5-meter penalty shot goal before halftime and 2 back-to-back goals at the start of the second half to narrow the Trojans’ lead to 9-4. The Trojans regained control and piled on goals to post a 17-6 finish. Freshman goalie Sam Krutonog led the defense with seven saves before sophomore goalie Vaios Vlahotasios took over in the fourth period with three saves of his own. 
“We did a really good job of making passes and not being selfish,” Vavic said. “We had a lot of opportunities where someone could’ve taken a shot and scored, but it’s much easier to make one more pass instead of trying to get all the fame by scoring.” 
Ehrhardt said that with a 24-1 record the Trojans need to keep the intensity up through the final weeks of the season. 
“It’s not really game-by-game; it’s the whole season, it’s really a process,” Ehrhardt said. “We lost at Stanford a few weeks ago and we knew that ever since then we weren’t really indestructible and we could lose any game. We’re just coming out at every game with super high intensity, just executing the game plan.”
On Saturday, both the women’s and men’s water polo teams will host the Alumni Games on at 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., respectively, where they will also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the program’s first-ever national championship, won by the men’s team in 1998. On Sunday, the Trojans host Pacific for a non-conference match at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

Senior forward Leah Pruitt has scored 10 goals in 2018, matching her total goal tally in 2016 and 2017 combined. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The USC women’s soccer team finished the season perfect at home, tallying a combined 10 goals against Oregon State on Thursday and Oregon on Sunday.
The Trojans carried their strengths of Thursday’s 5-0 victory over Oregon State into their performance against Oregon on Sunday to notch another 5-0 win in one of the team’s best performances of the season so far, which saw freshman forward Penelope Hocking posted her first hat trick.
The scoring started early as Hocking recorded the first goal from a chip five minutes into the game. She followed that up with another goal 15 minutes later. Just one minute later, redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo netted a goal with a weak-footed volley from the top of the box. The game appeared to be locked up after the Trojans were up 3-0, 22 minutes into the game.
The second half was much like the first. Hocking claimed her hat trick early on in the second half by scoring on a cross from redshirt junior forward Natalie Jacobs. The play started as DeMelo found Jacobs making a run out wide and connected a beautifully weighted ball to Jacobs, who later kept her composure to find Hocking on the end of the cross. Redshirt sophomore forward Samantha Bruder put the game to bed as she scored the fifth goal of the game off a pass by sophomore Arlie Jones. 
“I really wanted the hat trick, and I saw the keeper and I saw that show was coming near post, so I knew the only way that I was going to score was to get it over her head,” Hocking said. “It’s nice that not only [head] coach [Keidane] McAlpine trusts me, but also everyone on the team trusts me too that I can put the ball in the back of the net. That helps a lot, that faith and motivation to just do good for my team, it just makes everything better.”
In most games this season, Hocking has had to come off the bench as opposed to starting, but her performance lately made McAlpine give her the nod, and she did not disappoint. Despite her role, Hocking leads the team in goals this season, with 12 after the hat trick. 
“[Hocking] had such a good performance on Thursday, you could tell that she’s getting into form,” McAlpine said. “But more importantly, you can tell that our front players are starting to click and they are finding each other and looking for each other better. The movement into the gaps behind, even though they are small, they are finding them quicker and sharper which is putting them in good places, so nothing but quality touches for them today.”
On Thursday afternoon, the Women of Troy took on Oregon State. Going into the game, the No. 2-ranked Trojans were the favorites as the Beavers had only won two games all season. The game ended up being as lopsided as it was on paper — a 5-0 rout for USC.
The scoring started early as senior forward Leah Pruitt put one past the keeper off an assist from sophomore forward Tara McKeown. Just eight minutes later, the roles reversed as McKeown got her name on the scoresheet via an assist by Pruitt. At halftime, the Trojans led 2-0.
Just starting the second half, Hocking scored her first goal of the day, this time assisted by DeMelo. Three minutes later, Pruitt scored a rocket from 25 yards out from the goal to make the game 4-0 after 49 minutes of play. Hocking closed the game and scored her second on the day to take the scoreline to 5-0 in favor of the Trojans with 30 minutes left in the game.
“I thought it was a very good performance,” McAlpine said. “The challenge to them today was to put more shots on frame, to give us better chances to score goals. And today, we still got our 20 shots, but we put more on frame which equals more goals, which I thought was fantastic.”
The Trojans now sit with a 14-1-1 overall record for the season with three games left. First, the Trojans will travel to face Colorado squad on Thursday for a 2 p.m. kickoff. Following that, the Women of Troy will head to Salt Lake City to play Utah on Sunday at 11 a.m.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels left the Utah game with a possible concussion. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
As regular readers of “Keith’s Keys” know, I often write ledes that are flowery and somewhat clever (at least I’d like to think so). It might involve a long-winded story or metaphor about golfing or baseball, or some other sport that has nothing to do with the column I’m writing. But this time, I am going to be blunt and get straight to the point: It’s time to realize that the JT Daniels experiment is over. 
Former quarterback Sam Darnold was that Trojans’ Superman in the past two seasons. Super Sam’s late game heroics and unbelievable playmaking ability saved USC time and time again. 
But unlike his predecessor, the primary similarity I see between Daniels and Darnold is their tragic knack for inaccurate passes and turnovers. 
Yes, Darnold threw interceptions and fumbled the ball more than Michael Turner running down a hallway of Peanut Tillmans. He was, by no means, perfect. But, even with redshirt sophomore quarterback Matt Fink and other quarterbacks on the squad, there was no doubt that he was the right man for the job.
As much as I am hopeful and willing to give people the benefit of the doubt: I cannot be confident that the raw talent of Daniels is going to come through. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that this kid just turned 18 and that he  is supposed to be a high school senior right now. And I know that comparing Daniels to Darnold is like comparing rookie Peyton Manning — who threw 28 interceptions in 1998 — to present day Tom Brady. 
Daniels hasn’t developed into the poised and precise starting quarterback that he needs to be, and that’s okay. Everyone understood that when head coach Clay Helton brought in a young kid that he was going to take some time to develop. 
But what’s not okay is to keep using a quarterback who has now completed just 47 percent (24-for-51) of his passes, thrown four interceptions and consistently missed down-the-field throws.
If USC even wants a chance to sniff the beautiful air of Levi’s Stadium in December, Daniels needs to hit his receivers in stride. Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman should not be relied upon every week to make touchdown catches where he comes back 10 yards to the ball. 
When you first think about Daniels’ age, it is pretty exciting and amazing to think that an 18-year-old could lead one of the most distinguished football programs on the West Coast. 
But on second thought, it seems more foolish on the part of the USC coaching staff for putting so much trust into such a young player. 
While I am not necessarily advocating for an injured Fink or redshirt freshman Jack Sears to start, there is definitely reason to believe that someone else could be more capable of putting USC in the best position to win. 
However, I will say that Fink has shown that he has the tools to be a good quarterback in ways that Daniels has not. 
Unlike Daniels, who constantly underthrows streaking receivers and misses wide-open crossing patterns, Fink has an absolute cannon of an arm and an electric pair of legs that kept USC’s late drives alive against Utah. Although he might not be a Darnold through the air in terms of accuracy, Fink is better than Darnold on the ground and could give USC an added dimension that the pocket-passing, octogenarian-running Daniels simply cannot give. 
We are at the halfway point of this season. The team is now 4-3 and looking to just make a bowl game at this point, with the easiest part of USC’s schedule is coming up with teams like Arizona State, Oregon State, Cal and UCLA.
If there is any time to look towards rebuilding, it is now. Daniels had his opportunity to shine, but unfortunately, he has not showed that he can live up to the potential and the expectations of being a starting USC quarterback.
