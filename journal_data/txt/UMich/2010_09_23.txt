Wolverines for Rick.
Snyder joins more
traditional orgs. to
get students to polls
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
With just more than a month
until the midterm election, politi-
cal student groups on campus
have been developing strategies to
mobilize students around specific
candidates and emphasize the
importance of voting.
After the August primaries,
which saw Democrat Virg Ber-
nero and Republican Rick Snyder
emerge as their party's gubernato-
rial candidate, groups like the Uni-
versity's chapters of the College
Republicans and College Demo-
crats have been campaigning for
their respective candidates and
informing students about their
policies and goals for the state.
In addition to these groups,
students and Public Health and
Medicine Prof. Victor Strecher

created Wolverines for Rick Sny-
der last month. The group's goal is
to inform campus about Snyder's
incentives to change Michigan
and defy partisan divergence.
Strecher, a personal friend of
Snyder, said his primary role as
adviser to the group is to increase
voter turnout in favor of Sny-
der and help students within the
group develop campaign strate-
gies.
"(Snyder) is a very bright guy
who's also very warm," Strecher
said. "He's very caring; he's very
passionate. And he wouldn't be
running for governor unless he
felt Michigan has a chance at
rebuilding itself and becoming an
amazing state. "
Strecher said Snyder's moder-
ate viewpoints make him likeable
to both Democrats and Republi-
cans, and this is reflected by the
diversity of the group.
"We are a bunch of people from
very different political persua-
sions who all got together to say
we're tired of the status quo," Stre-
cher said. "We really are worried
about Michigan and we'd love to

All students in glee
clubs, marching

up for class credit
By JENNA SIMARD
For theDaily
The University's School of
Music, Theatre & Dance has
begun to heavily enforce a policy
that requires students who are

members of University-affiliated
ensembles to register for their
group as a class.
Though it's always been the pol-
icy of the School of Music for stu-
dents participating in ensembles
like the Michigan Marching Band
and Women's and Men's glee clubs
to register for those courses, this,
year the school is beefing up its
enforcement of the policy. In the
past, students registered for the
maximum number of credits or,
who were paying for their courses
per credit-hour were often excused

from the requirement to register.
"It is the policy of the Univer-
sity that students participating in
credit-bearing courses must enroll
in those courses," School of Music
Dean Christopher Kendall wrote
in an interview. "Ensembles listed
in the studenthandbook and on the
class schedule are credit-bearing
courses taught by faculty or GSIs
under the direct supervision of fac-
ulty."

Unite for Sight

In an effort to treat and
prevent blindness - a condi-
tion that is preventable more
than 80 percent of the time
- the University's chapter of
Unite for Sight is educating
and supporting communities
both local and abroad.
In the Ann Arbor area,
members for Unite For Sight
perform community service
activities like promoting eye
health at local elementary
schools, volunteering at the
Penrickton Center for Blind
Children in Taylor, Mich.
and hosting eyeglass drives
to acquire gently used read-
ing glasses, distance glasses
and sunglasses for later
donation.
The glasses collected at
the drives, which occur at
various points through-
out the year, are donated to

impoverished areas around
the world. LSA senior
and club president Angela
Verkade said members who
collect the most eyeglasses
are able to travel abroad
to distribute the glasses to
adults and children in need.
The club also donates
to health clinics in Ghana,
India and Honduras. Once
abroad, students can gain
clinical experience while
learning more about opto-
metric issues.
"Volunteers work under
the doctors and help in clin-
its and with patients," said
Verkade, who got involved
in the organization fresh-
man year after considering a
career in optometry.
To support the club's
upcoming trips, Verkade
said the group will be trick-

or-treating for eyeglasses
around Ann Arbor next
month on Halloween.
Verkade added that for the
remainder of the year, the
group hopes to continue to
educate children on simple
methods of blindness pre-
vention.
"At elementary schools,
we present different ways
for teachers to look out for
eye issues early on or we talk
to the students about proper
eye care," she said.
According to Verkade,
the club's members, whose
majors range from global
health to education to sociol-
ogy, are united by the desire
to provide service to others.
"What brings us together
is being able to help the com-
munity," she said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
* Gov't needs $134
a share to recover
GM money
A government watchdog says the
U.S. Treasury would have to sell its
General Motors stock for $133.78
each to get back the nearly $50 bil-
lion it spent bailing out the Detroit
automaker.
Special Inspector General
for bailout funds Neil Barofsky
revealed the figure in an Aug. 30
letter to Republican Sen. Charles
Grassley of Iowa. The letter was
obtained by The Associated Press
yesterday.
! He says the government gave
GM $49.5 billion to stay in busi-
ness. GM repaid $6.7 billion and
the rest was converted to preferred
shares and a 61 percent stake in the
company. The government plans to
start selling its GM shares in mid-
* November.
Barofsky told Grassley he would
look into the steps taken to make
sure taxpayers get their money back.
HELENA, Mont.
U.S. sen. says local
Canada border
crossing frivolous
A U.S. senator with an influential
voice in the dispute over a little-
used border post between Montana
and Canada said yesterday that offi-
cials should scrap an $8.5 million
stimulus-funded upgrade and shut
down the underused crossing.
Sen. Jon Tester said Canada,
which surprised U.S. officials by
closing its side of the Whitetail port
this summer, was not interested
in sharing a new station or fully
reopening its side of the border. He
said a renovation to the port going
into Saskatchewan no longer makes
sense.
The port is one of a few that ser-
vices a rural and long stretch of the
border in northeastern Montana.
Residents say it is largely used by
farmers who live in the area for
trade and convenience.
Federal officials say they can't
keep the border station open with-
out modernizing security. Ieforet
terrorism became a chief concern,
the station closed for the night by
a fin angeones insthe road,.
KABUL, Afghanistan
25 militants killed
at NATO outpost
near border
Insurgents attacked a NATO and
Afghan army outpost in eastern
. Afghanistan near the Pakistan bor-
Wder and at least 25 of the militants
were killed in the resulting skir-
mish, officials said yesterday.
Troops at the combat outpost
in Spera district of Khost province
returned fire with mortars late
Tuesday, killing 25 to 30 insur-
gents, NATO said in a statement.
Initial reports found there were no
civilian casualties, it said.
Gen. Raz Mohmmad Horya Khil,
a senior commander of the Afghan

National Army in the province, said
29 insurgents were killed. There
were no casualties among NATO or
Afghan troops, he said.
Horya Khil said the attack, com-
ing from the Pakistan side of the
border, was directed at the Mir
Safar joint-NATO and Afghan army
camp and lasted for more than two
hours. Helicopters were called in to
provide support.
Bodies and weapons on the field
were being recovered, he said.
LANSING
Retirement plan
stalling state's
budget negotiations
A plan aimed at sparking more
retirements of state government
workers continues to lack votes to
pass in the Michigan House.
The plan drew opposition late
yesterday afternoon from both
Democrats who hold the major-
ity in the House and Republicans.
Attempts to pass two versions of
the plan failed so convincingly that
votes weren't formally counted
before an electronic board display-
ing the votes was cleared.
A retirement incentive plan is
part of a tentative state budget
deal reached between Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
administration, Republican Sen-
ate Majority Leader Mike Bishop
and Democratic House Speaker
Andy Dillon.
The plan could raise at least $50
million in its first year.

French police chief:
Country facing a
'peak'terror threat

French Authorities
suspect al-Qaida
affiliate is plotting
PARIS (AP) - France is fac-
ing a "peak" terror threat, and
authorities suspect al-Qaida's
North African affiliate of plot-
ting a conventional bomb attack
on a crowded target, the national
police chief said yesterday.
The warning from National
Police Chief Frederic Pechenard
came on the eve of national pro-
tests that unions hope will send
millions into city streets, and
was the latest warning in a recent
drumbeat from French officials
that the public needs to be more
alert about terrorism.
"France is today under threat.
For that matter, French people
need to get used to it," he told
Europe-1 radio. "We're now fac-
ing a peak threat that can't be
doubted. There is a specific threat
against French interests."
"We have serious indications,
coming from reliable intelligence,
saying that there's an important
risk of an attack," he said, add-
ing that al-Qaida in the Islamic
Maghreb, or AQIM, "is targeting
us in particular."
Last week, there was a false
bomb alert at the Eiffel Tower,
and investigators are looking into
an anonymous phone call that
prompted police to evacuate the
most-visited monument in the
tourism-oriented country.
AQIM claimed responsibility
for last week's abduction of five
French nationals and two Afri-
cans in northern Niger. Peche-
nard said the group isn't thought
to have the means to launch a
nuclear or biological attack in
France, but could carry out assas-
sinations or attacks using conven-
tional explosives.
"In order to do the maximum
possible damage (such an attack)
would be likely to happen in a
place where there are lots of
people, which could be the pub-
lic transit system, a department
store or a gathering," Pechenard
said.
Last week, the French Senate
voted to ban burqa-style Islamic
veils in France, a subject that has
prompted warnings by AQIM.
Counterterrorism officials in

France say the ban is just one of
several factors that have made
France a target of the group.
Another was France's military
logistical support for a July raid
by Mauritanian forces against the
group that left six of its militants
dead. AQIM has its base in a vast
swath of African desert.
Today, hundreds of thousands
are expected to take to the streets
across France for demonstrations
against the government's pension
reform. A previous round of pro-
tests earlier this month brought
more than 1 million people out.
Pechenard said he didn't
believe the protests would be a
terrorist target.
But in an underground nerve
center at Paris police headquar-
ters, agents were bracing for any
possibility, laying out maps of the
planned march route in the capi-
tal and going over deployment
plans.
Olivier Bagousse, who runs the
Paris police department's Com-
mand and Information Center,
said authorities have stepped up
their alert level following recent
intelligence that France is under
high threat.
"For the last few weeks, we
have been particularly sensitive.
Our staffers have been encour-
aged anew to be on the lookout,"
he told The Associated Press in a
restricted-access zone at police
headquarters, which sits across
the square from Notre Dame
Cathedral. "We are very vigi-
lant."
The center resembles a small-
scale police version of NASA's
Mission Control: Officers plot
police positions on a big-screen
electronic city map - think
Google Maps - and keep tabs
on a wall of TV monitors feeding
in video from some of the 400
closed-circuit cameras scattered
throughout the city.
Using a computer's joystick,
one officer remotely zooms the
lens on a camera atop the famed
Arc de France in and out - peer-
ing down the bustling Champs-
Elysees.
Authorities are straddling a
fine line between keeping the
public watchful and sowing panic
or at least, as one police spokes-
man described it, "a situation
where people start seeing poten-
tial bombs everywhere."

President Barack Obama speaks at a summit on the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations yestenday.
At U -N., Obama calls

President pushes for
greater help despite
sour economy
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
President Barack Obama yes-
terday defended U.S. aid to
impoverished people even dur-
ing sour economic times at home
yet promised a sterner approach,
favoring nations that commit to
democracy and economic revival.
Addressing world leaders,
Obama offered no new commit-
ments of U.S. dollars, but rather
a blueprint of the development
policy that will drive his govern-
ment's efforts and determine
where the money flows. His mes-
sage was that the United States
wants to help countries help
themselves, not offer aid that pro-
vides short-term relief without
reforming societies.
"That's not development, that's
dependence," Obama said. "And
it's a cycle we need to break.

Instead of just managing poverty,
we have to offer nations and peo-
ple a path out of poverty."
Obama spoke at a major anti-
poverty summit convened by the
United Nations, one day ahead of
his main speech to the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly. The president is in
the midst of a three-day trip to the
U.N. for its annual meeting.
World leaders yesterday were
wrapping up an intensive review
of the poverty reduction goals
adopted 10 years ago, a highly
ambitious effort that has yielded
mixed results. The mission is
to cut extreme poverty, reduce
child and maternal mortality
and expand primary education,
among other objectives, by 2015.
The president, met by applause
as he took the grand U.N. stage,
sought to elevate the mission of
U.S. development.
Noting the Americans hurting
at home, where a recession has
eroded millions of jobs, Obama
defended the spending of U.S. tax
dollars to help others build up

their agriculture, transportation
and health systems. He called it
not just a moral imperative but an
investment that can help the global
economy and reduce the threats of
instability and extremism.
"Let's put to rest the old myth
that development is mere charity
that does not serve our interests,"
Obama said.
The White House framed the
president's blueprint as a fresh,
far-reaching approach to helping
other countries, although it builds
on programs of other presidents.
Obama sought to offer a sense of
clarity of why the United States
aids other nations, saying it is
"rooted in America's enduring
commitment to the dignity and
potential of every human being."
Obama said development
should no longer be measured by
how much money or medicine
is delivered, but by the extent to
which the U.S. helps countries
build up themselves. He aimed
to show toughness in setting
demands of recipient nations.

fragile peace efforts even as the
Palestinian president signaled
he may back away from threats
to quit negotiations if Israel
resumes West Bank settlement
construction.
At one point, Israeli riot police
stormed the hilltop compound
known to Jews as the Temple
Mount and to Muslims as the
Noble Sanctuary - the most
explosive site in the Israeli-Pal-
estinian conflict, and the place
where the last Palestinian upris-
ing began almost exactly 10 years
ago.
That uprising - which killed
thousands of people over some
five years of violence - erupt-
ed after a failed U.S.-led peace
effort at Camp David. Yester-
day's outburst comes less than
a month after the sides resumed
peace negotiations, at a tense
moment when those talks are
already facing possible col-
lapse over Israel's plans to end
its 10-month slowdown of con-
struction in the Jewish settle-
ments of the West Bank.
The "moratorium" on con-
struction was declared last
November under intense U.S.
pressure to help coax the Pal-
estinians into talks with the
government of Prime Minis-
ter Benjamin Netanyahu, who
- despite having accepted the
principle of a Palestinian state
- inspires very little faith in
the Palestinians. Netanyahu
said all along that the measure
would end on Sunday - and the
Palestinians have threatened to
walk away from the talks if this
occurs.
The impasse and looming

deadline have created a palpable
tension that has built throughout
the week.
On Monday, Israel's deputy
premier made a public call on
the Palestinians to abandon their
demand, casting such a move as
a mutual "compromise" in which
Israel might retain some of the
restrictions. On Tuesday, Israel's
military chief warned that a col-
lapse of the talks could well lead
to violence.
Meanwhile, the Israeli politi-
cal system braced for either out-
come. If Netanyahu backs down
and extends the freeze, troubles
with his pro-settler coalition
partners are likely and he would
have to persuade the centrist
Kadima party to join the coali-
tion.
If he doesn't and the talks
break down, Israel's internation-
al standing would suffer - along-
side the possibility of renewed
violence with the Palestinians.
A glimmer of hope arrived
from the United States, where
Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas indicated a possible soft-
ening of his position in a Tues-
day night address to prominent
American Jewish figures.
"I cannot say I will leave the
negotiations, but it's very dif-
ficult for me to resume talks
if Prime Minister Netanyahu
declares that he will continue his
(settlement) activity in the West
Bank and Jerusalem," Abbas
said, according to a transcript of
the event obtained by The Asso-
ciated Press.
The Palestinian ambassador
to the United Nations later said
Abbas' comments had been mis-
construed and Abbas was still
ready to walk away.
"The position of the presi-
dent is still the same," Riyad
Mansour said. But he stopped
short of a denial, and the S. Dan-
iel Abraham Center for Middle
East Peace, which sponsored
the meeting, said the comments
were recorded and Abbas was
speaking in English.

Opening counc il doors
Ann Arbor City Council must improve transparency
 an July of 2009, the Ann Arbor City Council was accused of
violating the Michigan Open Meetings Act. Less than 15
months later, City Council is again being accused of violat-
ing the act. On Friday, The Ann Arbor Chronicle filed suit against
the City of Ann Arbor for having a closed-door meeting on the
moratorium for medical marijuana. Though it remains to be seen
if the meeting was actually a breach of the act, City Council's
meeting violates the spirit of the law. City Council should be con-
siderate of residents who want to stay informed on local issues
and increase its efforts to be transparent.

A silly study

ANN ARBOR, Mich. - If you
use your cell phone to talk
about news of the day or to
express opinions about issues, you are
more likely to be
civically and politi-
cally engaged, a
new study says,"
says a Sept. 13 Uni-
versity News Ser-
vice report.
All names have been WILL
withdrawn. GRUNDLER

I'm wondering is this: What about
those people who aren't using their
phones to talk about issues and poli-
tics and stuff?
RESEARCHER 2: Hmmm. Probably
worth investigating?
RESEARCHER 1: Mind reader in the
building. Do we still have that student
cell phone data?
RESEARCHER 2:I just saw it some-
where... (Looks under Jenga tower.)
Here it is - Aw, crap.
RESEARCHER 1: Woooah, JENGA!
Ha ha. We won't count that, though.
Okay, let's see what we got here. Texts
AND calls, very nice. Should we show
them to readers?

The suit was filed in Washtenaw County
Circuit Court on Friday, according to a Sept.
20 article on annarbor.com. The suit focus-
es specifically on a meeting allegedly held
on Jul. 19 during which City Council mem-
bers discussed the medical marijuana policy
with the city attorney general. Dave Askins
and Mary Morgan - owners of The Chron-
icle - are claiming that council members
are engaged in "secret decision-making."
City Council says that the discussions were
protected by attorney-client privilege, but
Askins and Morgan disagree.
This problem has been addressed before.
In 2009, a group of local businesses sued
City Council after it was revealed that some
members had been sending private e-mails
during public meetings. That lawsuit ended
in a settlement and an amendment to the
rules of the Council that prohibits the use
of electronic communication to discuss city
matters during meetings. But the debacle
apparently didn't impress on City Council
the importance of transparency.
City Council still needs to be reminded
that it has a responsibility to incorporate
Ann Arbor residents' opinions into their
decisions. Issues important to local resi-
dents shouldn't be discussed without the
input of the people they will affect. By
leaving residents out of a meeting regard-

ing the medical marijuana moratorium,
City Council is denying them important
information. The lawsuit should be a wake-
up call to council members that they aren't
independent agents.
Though it's still unclear if the meeting to
discuss the medical marijuana moratorium
counted as a breach of the Open Meetings
Act, city council members shouldn't feel
comfortable with closed-door meetings of
any kind. The Michigan Open Meetings Act
is meant to protect residents' right to know
what is going on in their local government.
City Council is still violating the spirit of
the law. By holding meetings - even if they
are informal and don't technically break
the law - City Council is perpetuating the
sentiment that it is a restricted entity. This
feeling of entitlement is dangerous in a dem-
ocratic society because it lessens demands
for public accountability. City Council
should feel obligated to include the public in
all of its discussions to show residents that it
is working for them.r
City Council must enact a policy 'd total
transparency during meetings and they
need to ,follow the spirit of the Michi-
gan Open Meetings Act. The suit that
The Chronicle has filed should stand as a
reminder to City Council of its responsibil-
ity to Ann Arbor residents.

BRITTANY SMITH |
Global experience 101

0

At the housewarming event at North Quad
Residence Hall that took place last week, the
University delivered a message that it is shift-
ing its priorities. The University is presenting
itself as an institution whose liberal arts edu-
cation is focused on incorporating an interna-
tional experience.
Considering the large amount of reorgani-
zation, funding and attention being given to
resources and departments that are motivated
by a social justice and global education model,
I foresee the University shifting toward a cul-
ture similar to colleges like Carleton College in
Minnesota, Oberlin College in Ohio and Kal-
amazoo College. These colleges - according to
the Open Doors 2009 Survey on study abroad
participation - sent more than 80 percent of
their students to study abroad at least once dur-
ing their undergraduate career. The University
is on a path to create an atmosphere like these
schools in which it is commonplace for more
than half of LSA's undergraduate students to
study abroad at least once before graduation.
But unlike other institutions, the way that the
University is integrating a global immersive
experience into the curriculum of the College
of Literature Science, and the Arts is unique.
LSA is making efforts to shape its cur-
riculum to become increasingly global. For
instance, the Department of Intergroup Rela-
tions has created the Global Scholars Pro-
gram residential learning community, which
is housed in North Quad. The GSP is distinct
from other residential communities on cam-
pus. It exposes undergraduate students whose
intentional interests are to have an interna-
tional experience within a domestic locale.
Courses like University Courses 178 - Global
Understanding - show that LSA is committing
itself to shaping a global experience. When I was
a GSP student in Global Understanding, I took
classes with students from Seoul University in
Korea and the University of British Columbia
in Canada via video-conference. Students from
both Seoul and UBC were included in the twice-
a-week classroom instruction I was in.
Another instance in which the University is
distinguishing IGR as a leader in global edu-
cation is through its dialogue courses. These
courses give students the opportunity to have

a dialogue with their peers about imagery,
social class, race, prejudices and religion. The
common thread between courses like Global
Understanding, IGR dialogue courses, North
Quad's Global Scholars Program and LSA's
encouragement for undergraduates to study
abroad is the potential for change. The com-
mon theme is hope and a commitment that
demands responsibility.
By encouraging students to go beyond their
comfort zone in IGR courses or study abroad
programs, the University is providing a space
for students to learn from and engage in the
global community in a meaningful way. By tak-
ing strides to internationalize LSA's curricu-
lum, the University is displaying the value that
they place on a liberal arts education.
Globalizing the liberal arts curriculum of the
University gives LSA students the platform to
understand different kinds of people and vari-
ous traditions held around the world. Recently,
when I asked a few of my peers to describe their
study abroad experience, many explained their
experience in a way that described increased
understanding and global consideration. They
remarked that their positioning in the world had
expanded. They have adapted to other schools of
thought and communities of people in a way that
no textbook could have ever taught them. It's a
new kind of learning.
The transition to include more global com-
ponents in education is a positive move for LSA.
With higher value placed on receiving a global
education outside the walls of the University,
school officials will open students up to the pos-
sibility of establishing cultural and social sensi-
tivity that surpasses their own limitations.
The implication of this shift carries great
weight. Perhaps if more students take an active
interest, the cultural dynamic of the campus
will change.
The University has taken on the responsibil-
ity to create globally-minded citizens whose
future decisions might affect the entire world
by prioritizing a global education. I applaud
the University for restructuring their focus.
It's about time that some academics under-
stand that the best learning comes from doing.

AMERICAN MOVEMENT FOR ISRAEL |.

The crucial Middle East ally

0

Over 60 years ago, the State of Israel was created as a
refuge for a persecuted people yearning for reunification
with Zion after two thousand years. This state allowed
Jews disjointed by national boundaries to finally real-
ize that the unifying principles of freedom and equality
could empower them to thrive against seemingly insur-
mountable odds. Indeed, it is no coincidence that Israel
was founded on the same enduring democratic principles
as its greatest ally, the United States. As a matter of fact,
Freedom House - an independent watchdog organization
that examines the state of freedom in all nations - gave
Israel its highest and second-highest respective marks
in the categories of political rights and civil liberties. In
an incredibly volatile region marked by unpredictable
and hostile authoritative regimes, Israel stands as the
one crucial American ally in the Middle East prepared
to uphold the mutually fundamental values of democracy
and make rational, carefully calculated decisions in the
foreign policy realm.
Not only does Israel serve as a reliable asset by making
measurable decisions in an otherwise unstable region, it
provides the United States with vast economic, techno-
logical and security-oriented benefits. The U.S. is Israel's
largest state trading partner and conducts billions of dol-
lars worth of business with its Middle East ally each year,
importing a slew of high-tech products developed exclu-
sively in Israel that are applicable to a variety of American
economic sectors. Last year, Israel and the United States
verified over $28 billion in trade transactions.
Some argue that moral obligation and trade relations
don't sufficiently justify a relationship with Israel, a coun-
try that has strained diplomatic ties with Arab neighbors
the U.S. seeks to befriend. These detractors, however, fail
to realize the depth of U.S.-Israel cooperation, a shared
interaction whose strength and comprehensiveness vast-
ly outweighs the unfounded perceptions of certain states.
In addition to sharing essential values and trading goods
with the United States, Israel provides extensive knowl-
edge regarding unconventional warfare with Islamic
extremists and homeland security operations to its
American counterparts. Intelligence exchanges between
the two countries are essential, especially to American

personnel waging two similar wars in foreign countries
marked by unfamiliar geography, culture and political
structure. Furthermore, Israel provides the U.S. with
operational guidance about security measures, ensuring
that the American government is able to simultaneously
maintain an open, democratic society while protecting its
citizens from domestic threats across the country.
Though the content of such high-level security meet-
ings are kept private, U.S. officials don't hesitate to empha-
size their crucial importance. Andrew Shapiro, Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs and former
senior adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, refer-
enced these talks in July when he stated, "our regular and
well-established meetings have recently been supplemented
by an unprecedented number of intimate consultations at
senior levels ofour governments [..which] provide an oppor-
tunity for our governments to share perspectives on poli-
cies, address mutual concerns, explain threat perceptions,
and identify new areas for cooperation."
Arguably the most important aspect of the U.S.-Israel
relationship is the strong connection shared by citizens of
both nations for lasting peace in the region. The American
people have consistently applauded Israel's attempts to indi-
cate a serious desire for peace, whether they are offering
over 90 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Arafat
for a future Palestinian state in 2000 or executing a unilat-
eral withdrawal of troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 to
encourage Palestinian independence and development.
More than an alliance based on shared values, trade and
a desire for peace, the U.S.-Israel relationship is at its foun-
dation a bond that aims to extend human advancement. By
supporting innovation and growth in secure and free societ-
ies, the United States and Israel serve as models to all oth-
ers, embodying the comprehensive success associated with
democratic cooperation. The current peace talks show this
vital relationship remains strong: while the U.S. helps Israel
address its unique security concerns, Israel continues to
reach out to the United States and the Palestinians as essen-
tial partners in a questfor peace sorely needed by all.
This viewpoint was written by Max Friedman on
behalf of the American Movement for Israel.

Fraternities get creative to
cope with temporary housing

Delta Upsilon and
Sigma Phi Epsilon in
temporary quarters
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
With fraternity and soror-
ity recruitment in full swing this
week, Greek organizations on
campus are taking advantage of
their houses to show prospective
pledges part of what Greek life has
to offer.
But two fraternities on cam-
pus - Delta Upsilon and Sigma
Phi Epsilon - are using some-
what temporary housing situ-
ations to recruit new members
this fall.
Delta Upsilon - the fraternity
house that burned down in 2008
- is scheduled to have its house
reconstructed by January, said
LSA senior and president John
Stevens.
The chapter and those involved
in its reconstruction were delayed
three months over the summer
after issues arose during negotia-
tions with an insurance company.
The negotiations, Stevens said,
centered on the installation of a
$500,000 Heating Ventilating and
Air Conditioning system in the
house.
Stevens said instead of settling

the cost of installation and con-
tinuingthe rebuilding process, the
alumni in charge of the construc-
tion planning decided to focus first
on cheaper aspects like electricity
and plumbing.
Negotiations with the insurance
company were settled within the
past few weeks, Stevens said, and
external construction has restart-
ed along with the installation of
the HVAC system.
Stevens added that the alumni
are concerned not with building
the house quickly but rather build-
ing one that will last with energy-
efficient systems, like the HVAC
system and electronic locks on the
main doors.
"Our fraternity house is the old-
est one on campus built for a fra-
ternity, and we plan to keep that
tradition going far into the 22nd
century," Stevens said.
The majority of the brothers
that are planning on living in the
house at the start of next year
are currently living at 1315 Cam-
bridge St., with a few other mem-
bers residing in a house on White
Street.
Stevens said the lack of a physi-
cal fraternity house has not hin-
dered recruitment efforts, adding
that the chapter is in fact having
one of its most successful recruit-
ments in recent memory.
"We're making the best of what
was dealt to us," he said. "We got

handed some lemons, and we're
making lemonade."
Another fraternity without a
designated fraternity house last
year, Sig Ep, has relocated to a
house at 704 Hill St., chapter pres-
ident Rick Stepanovic wrote in an
e-mail interview.
Stepanovic, who is an LSA
junior, wrote that the chapter's
Alumni Volunteer Corporation
found the new house, which used
to be leased to several groups unaf-
filiated with the Greek communi-
ty. The house is now leased to Sig
Ep for two years with the option of
renewal for up to 10 years.
The tentative plan, Stepanovic
wrote, is to stay in the newfound
location unless a more desirable
property becomes available to
them.
"Ironically, this is not the first
time Sig Ep has been located
at the intersection of State and
Hill," Stepanovic wrote in the
e-mail. "For roughly 70 years, we
owned a house located where the
Ford School of Public Policy now
stands."
Stepanovic added that hav-
ing a house this year is helping
with recruitment, given the new
house's convenient location and
"spacious" front lawn.
"However, as can be seen by
our recruitment success last year,"
Stepanovic wrote, "a fraternity is
much more than a building."

make Michigan a place that we all
want to stay and work in."
The group hopes to work with
neighboring universities, like
Michigan State University, to con-
tinue to increase support for Sny-
der.
"I believe that the students who
are involved in the campaign for
RickSnyder,are intereste4 ir pull-
ing people together more toward
a common ground," Strecher said.
Brendan Campbell, chairof Col"
lege Democrats, said he believes
that despite the fact that Snyder
has received increased support
from Democrats, Virg Bernero is
the best candidate for represent-
ing student needs, largely because
he strongly supports greater fund-
ing for Michigan's schools.
"Virg Bernero has consistently
demonstrated that he's going to
invest in education, both K-12 and
higher education, and adequately
fund education to the point that
it needs to be funded," Campbell
said. "We think that students have
been hit hard enough, and that it's
time students vote for a candidate
who's looking out for their best
interests."
LSA senior Joshua Arocho,
the communications director for
Wolverines for Rick Snyder, said
that while Snyder has widespread
appeal that transcends partisan
lines, his election could also make
strides for the Republican Party.
"We feel like we can make a
pretty big impact on this tradition-
ally liberal campus," Arocho said.
Arocho added that the group
aims to gain more members
through an upcoming mass meet-
ing. Group members are also try-

ing to host a town hall-type event
for Snyder to speak to students,
as well as have him speak on the
steps of the Michigan Union in the
week leading up to the election.
Charles Bogren, chairman
of College Republicans, said he
believes Snyder has been receiving
increased support because he is
genuinely concerned about fixing
the state, in addition to his strong
business background.
"He's a self-made man," Bogren
said. "He's clearly an intelligent
person who knows whetiha elednts
to do in the business world and
wants to bring that over to the
political side and fix the state of
Michigan. I think that's resonated
really well with a lot of people in
this state because this state has
had a lot of problems in the past."
Bogren said the support Sny-
der has received from Democrats
shows his dedication to improv-
ing the state and uniting people
together to reach this goal.
"I think a lot of the crossover
votes show how passionate he
is about fixing and re-inventing
Michigan," Bogren said. "He's
done a really good job at reach-
ing out to all corners across the
board."
In addition to mobilizing stu-
dents to vote for Snyder, Bogren
said the most important way for
College Republicans to garner
support for Republican candidates
is through grassroots efforts.
"We're focusing mainly on the
actual student body, just trying to
get them out to the meetings, talk-
ing to them, wherever we can,"
Bogren said. "We're just kind of
getting our message across and
showing that there is an alterna-
tive to just the Dems on this cam-

pus."
Bogren said College Republi-
cans has been working to bring
Republican candidates to speak
on campus, including Republican
National Committee Chairman
Michael Steele. They have also
been campaigning from the Fix
Michigan Center on State Street,
making phone calls urging citi-
zens to vote for Republicans.
Similarly, College Democrats
has been working to "actively,
engage and encourage" students,
acc6rding 50-ampbell.
"The most important thing that
we're doing on campus is mobi-
lizing students in their residence
halls, so that they talk with their
neighbors and encourage their
neighbors to register to vote and to
vote democratic," Campbell said.
Over the past few weeks, Col-
lege Democrats has brought in
candidates like U.S. Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich), U.S. Rep. Mark
Schauer (D-Mich.), U.S. Rep.
Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and former
Democratic presidential candidate
Howard Dean. They also invited
Democratic candidate for Michi-
gan Secretary of State Jocelyn

Campbell said the group hopes
to bring in more candidates in the
weeks to come, as well as contin-
ue to help Democrats campaign

areas where a competitive race is
anticipated.
They also plan to take a trip

Statement comes as
U.S. claims Chinese
currency policy
costs American jobs
NEW YORK (AP) - Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao expressed
optimism yesterday that the
United States and China would
resolve major trade frictions,
even as he rejected U.S. claims
that Beijing's currency policies
cost American jobs.-
Despite sometimes tough
words, Wen used much of a
speech on the sidelines of a Unit-
ed Nations global summit to try
to ease U.S. anger against China
ahead of a meeting today with
President Barack Obama.
Relations between the pow-
ers have suffered recently, but
Wen sought to play down eco-
nomic, military and diplomatic
tensions. The United States and
China, Wen told business lead-
ers gathered at the Waldorf-
Astoria hotel,= are "not rivals
in competition but partners in
cooperation." IV1 'r1i i' i
Wen, however, pushed back
against U.S. claims that Beijing's
tightly regulated, underval-
ued currency - the yuan - gives
China's exporters an artificial
advantage over U.S. manufactur-
ers. Ahead of U.S. congressional
elections in November and at a
time of high American unem-
ployment, China's economic and

trade policies are a major friction
in ties with Washington.
Wen warned that China's cur-
rency must not be turned into a
political issue between the coun-
tries. He saw no link between the
yuan's value and China's trade
advantage over the United States.
The politically sensitive U.S.
trade deficit with China jumped
to $26.2 billion in June, the larg-
est one-month gap since October
2008.
"We do not seek a trade sur-
plus," Wen said through an inter-
preter. Many Chinese companies,
he said, would go bankrupt and
workers would suffer if the Chi-
nese currency rose drastically.
The Obama administration
must balance pressure on Bei-
jing's economic policies with
its desire for Chinese help in
settling nuclear standoffs with
North Korea and Iran and on
other global initiatives. China
is a veto-wielding member of
the U.N. Security Council and
recently passed Japan as the
world's second-biggest economy.
Speaking ahead of Wen, U.S.
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke
pushedfor a change i- China'st
currency policy and called for a
fair business environment that
allows Americans to compete
with Chinese companies and
invest without hindrance.
Locke said a "worldwide
rebalancing, in which America
buys a little less and sells a little
more to China and the rest of the
world, will create a more pros-

perous future for everyone." He
said "strong and lasting global
growth cannot be built on the
backs of debt-ridden U.S. con-
sumers."
Some U.S. lawmakers are
pushing for a bill that would pun-
ish China if it doesn't do more to
let the yuan rise.
Obama, speaking Monday in
Washington, said China's cur-
rency "is valued lower than
market conditions would say it
should be."
"So it gives them an advantage
in trade," Obama said. "We are
going to continue to insist that on
this issue, and on all trade issues
between us and China, that it's a
two-way street."
Currency is not the only point
of tension between the countries.
Thursday's Obama-Wen meet-
ing also comes as China lashes
out at the United States for what
Beijing says is interference in its
territorial disputes in the South
China Sea. China is also angry
over U.S. arms sales to Beijing
rival Taiwan and Obama's meet-
log earlier this year with the
Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan
Buddhist leader China calls a
separatist.
Still, Wen was consistently
optimistic in his speech, saying
the countries' common interests
far outweigh differences.
"We don't have any reason to
let our relationship back-peddle,"
Wen said, and "tens of thousands
of reasons" to move forward in
strengthening ties.

city is currently waiting to hear
which locations Google will chose.
He estimated that of the 1,100
Google received a selected group of
those applications will be looked at
in more detail. Google employees
will probably scope out potential
Google Fiber communities, he said.
"So we're waiting to see and
we're excited to hear, hopefully, if
we're on the 'short list,"' he said.
While Google has not said how

many cities will be selected as win-
ners, the project's website said it
will reach between 50,000 and
500,000 people.
Crawford, who helped fill out
the application, said he and other
members of the community gath-
ered data on the city and had the
opportunity to write a few essays
about why Ann Arbor should be
chosen. The essays are available at
www.a2fiber.com.
"We have an intelligent commu-
nity in Ann Arbor (that) is already
highly wired," Crawford said.
"There's just a tremendous amount

of opportunity here, and I think it
would be fantastic for Ann Arbor
and for Google."
Rackham student Augie Hill,
a member of the "Ann Arbor for
Google Fiber" Facebook group
which had members as of late last
night, said he thinks Ann Arbor
would benefit greatly by becoming
a Google Fiber trial location.
"Making Ann Arbor the first
place in the world for the next
round of technological' improve-
ments would bring much attention,
opportunity and prosperity to the
city and region," Hill said.

said.
When the U.S. News and World
Report rankings were released
over the summer, University offi-
cials said they didn't feel the rank-
ings were overly important.
However, in an e-mail sent to
The Michigan Daily on Monday,
a senior communications offi-
cial at the University promoted
the University's ranking in the
Times Higher Education evalua-
tion, encouraging coverage of the
news.
"Times Higher Education new
world university rankings put the
University of Michigan at num-
ber 15 overall (!) and even higher
for public universities - number
3," the official wrote. "We know
there are a lot of rankings out
there, but this one has proven to
be respected around the world."
Inan interview yesterday, Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
aid said the e-mail was sent out to
promote the new ranking system
because of the global perspective
it provides, not because the Uni-
versity achieved a high rank.
"It was noted to (The Michi-
gan Daily) specifically because of
our emphasis on globalization,"
Fitzgerald said, referencing the
University's focus on globaliza-
tion, which it highlighted in a
self-study report given to the
agency that accredits the Univer-
sity earlier this year.
Asked what the ranking meant
for the University, Fitzgerald said
University officials are happy to
be ranked so favorably.
"It's nice to see that different
perspective," Fitzgerald said,
comparing the globally focused
rankings to those done domesti-
cally. "Of course, we're always
gratified to be recognized near
the top of those lists."
However, Fitzgerald said no
matter how high a school ranks,
a ranking shouldn't be the sole
reason for potential students to
choose which school they will
attend.
"Regardless of the rankings,
we still maintain that rankings

sure compliance with the policy
isn't too much of a burden.
"The SMTD (School of Music,
Theatre & Dance) is being respon-
sive to the situation by working on
a case-by-case basis this semes-
ter with students for whom this
requirement puts them above 18
credits to advise and support them
regarding ensemble participation,"
Kendall wrote.
Matt Griffith, the Men's Glee
Club major media manager, said
the Men's Glee Club has always
had the option to register for the

alone are not the way to pick a
university," Fitzgerald said. "No
matter how well a university does
in the rankings ... there is no single
number one school for everyone."
Asked whether University pffi-
cials viewed one survey as a more
accurate portrayal of quality in
higher education, Fitzgerald said
each ranking provides a different
but equally important perspec-
tive.
"We're not saying that one is
better than the other," Fitzgerald
said, adding that all rankings are
equally interesting. "They're sim-
ply different."
The difference between the
rankings released by different
organizations, Fitzgerald said,
demonstrates how different cri-
teria are used to determine the
quality of universities.
"It's important to look at
what's valued in these rankings,"
Fitzgerald said. "Often, criteria
are tweaked and adjusted over
the years."
Times Higher Education
claims its criteria are a more
objective method for evaluating
the quality of universities, since
they rely on more quantifiable
variables.
"These tables represent the
most comprehensive and sophis-
ticated exercise ever undertaken
to provide transparent, rigor-
ous and genuinely meaningful
global-performance comparisons
for use by university faculty, stra-
tegic leaders, policymakers and
prospective students," the Times
Higher Education website boasts.
The criteria used in the Times
Higher Education process rely
heavily on research activity and
impact. Thirty percent of the
overall score relies on the vol-
ume, income and reputation of
research, while 32.5 percent of
the overall score relies on the
influence of the school's research
activity.
The rest of the overall score is
made up of the quality of teach-
ing and the learning environment'
- 30 percent of the total score -
and the international diversity of
an institution and the presence
of innovation through industry
income.

ensemble, but it was never offi-
cially required. He added that the
enforcement of the policy initially
presented a challenge for the club,
but it has been able to work through
it quite well.
"So many people are so passion-
ate about Glee Club, so they have
been willing to switch around their
schedules to fit it in," he said.
Griffith added that though this
is an administrative change in the
way things have been done in the
club for the past 50 years, it is noth-
ing the group can't handle.
Women's Glee Club director
Julie Skadsem said the Women's
Glee Club is an ensemble that has
been no stranger to this policy. The

group, she said, required its mem-
bers to register for the club as a
class for a number of years but has
always been able to make excep-
tions for students taking the maxi-
mum number of credits.
"If we had girls who were
already at 18 credits, we would
have them submit in writing why
they were unable to register," Skad-
sem said, adding that those appeals
will now have to be considered by
the School of Music under the new
enforcement rules.
The Michigan Marching Band
is one ensemble that has always
heavily enforced this policy among
its participants, according to direc-
tor Scott Boerma. Boerma said it is

By STEVEN KELLNER
For theDaily
With the departure of five Wol-
verines to the pros, the Michigan
baseball team looked to break in
some new players in Wednesday's
scrimmage against the Ontario
Blue Jays.
Many fans remember the ESPN
* highlights of the Wolverines over-
coming a 14-1 deficit to topple
Northwestern last spring, but this
is an entirely new squad.
Led by speedy centerfielder
Patrick Biondi and power-hitting
catcher Coley Crank, Michigan
looks to build on an impressive
2010 campaign that saw the Wol-
verines finish second in the Big Ten
regular season. A 24-1 victory over
the Blue Jays on Wednesday in Ann
Arbor was a sign of good things to
come.
Trhe core of last season's team
was drafted within the first 20
rounds of the Major League Base-
ball draft this past June, beginning
with star outfielder Ryan Lamarre
going 61st overall to the Cincinnati
Reds.
Lamarre hit .282 with the low
class-A Dayton Dragons before get-

ting a late-season call up to high-A
Lynchburg.
The Reds also selected former
Wolverine catcher Chris Berset in
the 20th round.
He was sent to the Billings Mus-
tangs of the rookie Pioneer League.
The Seattle Mariners and Florida
Marlins picked pitchers Alan Oaks
and Tyler Burgoon in the eighth
and 10th rounds, respectively.
Oaks was a former Friday starter
and Burgoon was the closer last
season.
The biggest surprise of the 2010
draft class was pitcher Matt Miller.
A fifth round pick of the Milwau-
kee Brewers, Miller went 7-2 with
a 4.06 ERA en route to helping the
Helena Brewers (also of the Pio-
neer League) to a league champion-
ship this season.
"I keep tabs with all of them over
time," Michigan Coach Rich Malo-
ney said, "They're great guys."
The main goal of the day for
Michigan was to work in the new
players. Michigan started four
players who have yet to see exten-
sive action at the collegiate level,
including one true freshman.
"We were playing a lot of kids at
different positions, kind of getting
a feel for our team," Maloney said.
Sophomore outfielder Kevin
Krantz, who has only four hits in
22 career at bats at Michigan, made
his presence felt in the second
inning with a home run over the
left center field fence, along with
another blast that almost landed on

the softball field later in the game.
True freshman Alex Lakatos
also made a worthwhile contribu-
tion.
A right-handed pitcher by trade,
Lakatos started in the nine-hole, at
designated hitter. He ended a solid
afternoon with a solo home run.
Last season's returning starters
played well against the Blue Jays,
too. Biondi, a sophomore, was back
to his normal self, sliding head-first
into bases, while walkingtwice and
stealing two bases. Crank added a
solo shot over the left centerfield
fence.
The brightest spot for the Wol-
verines, however, was sophomore
Bobby Brosnahan.
Brosnahan, who came on late
last season and developed into
the Sunday starter for Michigan,
pitched three scoreless innings
while allowing only two hits.
Michigan will likely lean on him
this season to be an anchor of the
rotation.
A great baseball team needs to be
solid up the middle of the field, and
Michigan returns Crank at catcher,
senior Anthony Toth at second
base, sophomore Derek Dennis at
shortstop and Biondi roaming cen-
terfield.
Maloney is looking this fall to
see what his team can improve
upon. And so far, he likes what he
sees.
"I thought we did a pretty nice
job," said Maloney, "I saw pretty
much what I was hoping for."

By EVERETT COOK
For theDaily
It is unusual for a college
baseball
game to ONTARIO 1
be played MICHIGAN 24
in Sep-
tember, so it makes sense that an
early-season scrimmage for the
Michigan baseball team would
be anything but ordinary.
The Wolverines defeated
the Ontario Blue Jays 24-1 in a
game that was planned to last
14 innings, behind an impres-
sive display of power from many
up-and-comers. Michigan hit six
home runs, with Kevin Krantz
blasting two against the helpless
Blue Jay pitchers.
"It's always good when we can
manufacture runs," Krantz said.
"This game put everything in
perspective for where we are as
a team, and it's great."
The Wolverines put on an
impressive show in their first
preseason scrimmage, even
though it came against an under-
I8 team. The Blue Jays are a
summer baseball program in
the Premier Baseball League of
Ontario, and despite their youth,
they stuck with the Wolverines

until the fourth inning when
Michigan broke through for six
runs.
This served as a first test for,
the young Wolverines, and coach
Rich Maloney was impressed
with their performance.
"I saw what we were pretty
much looking for," Maloney said.
"I thought it was an encouraging
game."
There are many questions
surrounding the team's lack of
experience following departures
from last year, but Krantz is not
worried.
"We are young, but today real-
ly shows we can play," Krantz
said. "This was very positive."
Maloney mentioned the
importance of young, inexperi-
enced players stepping up, and
many of those players welcomed
the challenge. Freshman Alex
Lakatos had three hits, including
a home run, and Krantz had four
hits and four RBI, including two
long balls.
Some big contributors from
last year did not want to be left
out of the scoring party. Red-
shirt junior first baseman Gar-
ret Stephens drove in seven
runs on three hits and a homer,
and junior catcher Coley Crank

accounted for three RBI and a
home run.
obviously, the offense was
impressive, but holding a team
to one run over 14 innings is
also nothing to scoff at. Pitch-
ers Bobby Brosnahan (redshirt
freshman) and Kolby Wood
(junior) both impressed, com-
bining, for six innings, no runs
and six strikeouts.
In the end, one of the main dif-
ferences between the two squads
proved to be the leather. The
Wolverines played solid defense
throughout the night, turning
four double plays, while the Blue
Jays kept innings alive with their
six errors. Michigan also did a
good job of capitalizing and not
letting many opportunities pass
them by.
Despite the lopsided score, the
win gave the team something to
build upon, which is substantial,
considering they will not play
another game for roughly four
months.
"We got the chance to play
somebody else and got the
chance to be responsive to who
we are," Maloney said. It may
have just been a scrimmage, but
the players and coaching staff
are clearly eager for the spring.

Walk-on Kovacs earns respect on'D'

0

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
It seemed fitting that, on the day
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
cracked jokes inviting any athletic
male students to walk onto the Wol-
verines as a kicker, a walk-on made
headlines.
Redshirt sophomore safety
Jordan Kovacs led the Michigan
defense with 11 tackles and a forced
fumble last Saturday in a win over
Massachusetts. He's started all
three games this season, and he's
been one of the few bright spots in
the Wolverine secondary so far.
Twoyears ago, Kovacs could only
dream of playing - let alone start-
ing - for the Michigan football
team.
His father, Lou, had walked on
at Michigan in the early 1980s and
played in one game in 1982. Kovacs
had opportunities to play else-
where, like a preferred opportunity
at Toledo, but he chose to follow his
father's footsteps.
He'd been asked back after initial
tryouts during his freshman year,
but Kovacs needed to undergo sur-
gery on his knee before he could
continue with the walk-on process.
Last January, he tried out again and
Rodriguez invited him back.

ay that made his head spin. Kovacs said that understanding
he had no clue where he was makes him more comfortable with
his role within the defense. His sta-
tus on the team has changed this
fall, too.

Senior safety Jordan Kovacs has been a welcome surprise in the secondary this season, despite Michigan's struggles on defense.
Kovacs walked on to the team and, before the season, Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez offered him a scholarship.

Kovacs can't always figure out
when he's recognized, either. He
laughed, telling a story about a
woman coming up to him during a
shopping trip at Kroger in his home-
town, Curtis, Ohio.
"I was wearing some Michi-
gan stuff, and some lady came up
to me and said, 'Hey, is your name
Jacob?"'Kovacs said. "I said no, and

I walked away. My mom was with
me, and she was like, 'I think she
was looking for you because she was
wearing all Michigan (clothing)."'
A first-name slipup, but still not
bad for someone who wasn't on
Michigan's roster two years ago.
That part of the story - how special
his roster spot is - is not something
lost on Kovacs. And that's what

drives him each day in practice and
in each game.
"I (try to remind myself) how
lucky I am every day," Kovacs said.
"Some days, you're going to practice
and it's like, 'Oh, God, practice',butI

Younger Saad explodes for
hat trick in overtime win

Freshman leads nation
in scoring after
three-goal game
By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Just when it looked as if the Mich-
igan men's soccer team was headed
to another
overtime KENTUCKY 2
draw, MICHIGAN 3
freshman
forward Soony Saad abruptly ended
the speculation.

His game-winning header came
at 1:41 into the first overtime, giving
him his first Michigan hat trick and
cementing the team's first victory
in three games, a 3-2 win over Ken-
tucky last night.
Michigan (4-1-3) showed its deter-
mination from the start, as Saad's
first goal came just 3:13 into the first
period and marked just the second
goal scored in the first half all season
for the Wolverines.
The score came off a pass from
senior midfielder Justin Meram that
Saad drilled from 18 yards out into
the lower left corner of the Kentucky
goal. Meram's aggressive play all

game earned him two assists on the
night.
But despite taking a 1-0 lead, the
Wolverine offense was stifled all
half Michigan headed to halftime
with just four shots and only one on
goal - the lowest in both categories
in one period all season.
Michigan gave up the equalizer in
the 46th minute, as a Kentucky ball
slipped past the Wolverines' back
line and redshirt senior goalkeeper
Chris Blais to tie the game at one.
The match was one of the most
physical and aggressive games the
team has played all season, as Ken-
tucky picked up seven yellow cards.

The pitch was slick from rain and
both teams were forced to grind it
out from the start.
"There were a lot of tackles out
there," freshman defender Ezekiel
Harris said. "You couldn't be in the
game today if you didn't want to get
dirty."
Both teams netted their second
goals in regulation, with Michigan's
coming from Saad in the 74th minute
off a free kick. Saad led the way with
six total shots and three on goal.
The Wildcats converted a corner
in the last minute of regulation to
force overtime, something the Wol-
verines are all too familiar with this
season. But this overtime period
was short-lived, as Saad finished
the game with his third goal of the
night to lead the Wolverines into
Big Ten play on a high note.
"This game was vital," Saad said.
"No one wants to go in with their
heads down before they play a big
rival, especially Ohio State. That
being said, the way we won today
was an eye-opener, and also it was
a little warm-up for the hard tackles
and the hard game we face on Sat-
urday."
With eight total shotson goal, the
Michigan offense knows it needs to
start converting the opportunities it
creates, especially on corner kicks.
The Wolverines took eight corner
kicks against Kentucky, but couldn't
capitalize on any of them.
Playing host to conference rival
Ohio State on Saturday, Michigan
is riding the positives from yester-
day's game - especially Soony's hot
foot -until kickoff.
"I think good teams have to find
ways to win games," Michigan
coach Steve Burns said. "And this is
a team that is starting to figure that
out."

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
During a non-conference sched-
ule that featured five overtime
finishes and one last-minute regu-
lation victory, the Michigan men's
soccer team has leaned heavily on
the fresh legs of the freshman class.
With just a few days left before
the kickoff of the Big Ten season,
Michigan coach Steve Burns has
called on his rookies to play an even
bigger role on both ends of the field.
Freshman forward Soony Saad
has carried the offense all year
long, most evident in his three-goal
effort against Kentucky (2-4-1) on
Wednesdaynight.
He scored in each period to help
the Wolverines capture a 3-2 over-
time win.
The dynamic forward climbed
atop the nation in scoring with his
hat trick against the Wildcats, put-
ting his season total at seven goals.
"It's definitely a plus when you
score three goals, but it's an even
bigger plus when they are the only
three," Saad said. "I just wanted to
win, whether it was three (goals of

my own) or three goals from anoth-
er teammate, I would be happy."
Michigan (4-1-3) is unbeaten in its
last six games, but has been plagued
with fatigue and injury after playing
several notably aggressive teams.
Senior defender Jeff Quijano was
removed from the starting lineup
last week, opening a space for fresh-
man Ezekiel Harris - a converted
forward - to join the Wolverines'
back line.
His speed and offensive-minded
attack have led to more quality scor-
ing chances, and his defense has
been nearly mistake-free.
"Coach has told me multiple
times that my duties are defense
first," Harris said. "I'm a natural
forward, so I go up (on the attack)
a lot, but you really have to combine
together and be a different breed to
play both ways."
The new starting lineup con-
sists of four freshmen. But when
sophomore midfielder Hamoody
Saad went down after a slide
tackle from a Kentucky defender
and sustained a hip flexor injury,
freshmen Dylan Mencia and Fabio
Pereira Villas Boras were thrust

into more prominent roles. Those
two will probably get considerably
more playing time during the next
few weeks.
Heading into conference match-
ups, the underclassmen will play a
critical role in determining whether
the team will be able to stay afloat in
the Big Ten.
"Our team is pretty young with
a couple sophomores and a couple
freshmen starting," Soony said.
"We're just going to keep growing
as a team and bond together even
more. The youth that we have can
definitely work to our advantage,
and I think it will as the season goes
on."
Michigan faces its first con- 0
ference test this Saturday with a
faceoff against No. 23 Ohio State in
Ann Arbor.
After being a Big Ten bottom-
feeder last season, Burns knows that
the only way to climb the ranks is
for the young players to contribute
all over the field.
"With a lot of young guys on the
field,the only way you gain that kind
of experience is getting forged in the
fire," Burns said.

From Garage to Studio
Many PAT majors were introduced
to their future course of study by a
technology hardly more professional
than a cell phone: thatirrepressible
anyone-can-be-a-musician program,
GarageBand.
"I started playing in a band my
junior year of high school," said PAT
senior Peter Raymond. "After I started
with the band, I realized I had Garage-
Band, and I had one microphone from
connecting to a digital piano. So we
originally just used that one micro-
phone to record everything that we
did. And then from there, I just started
reading more about recording, and I
decided that was really what I wanted
to become involved in."
Raymond decided to go out for PAT
on a whim, after having already been
accepted to LSA. For the application,
he had to send in a portfolio with one
stereo recording (two channels of
sound), one multitrack (multiple mics
picking up different musical parts, not
necessarily at the same time) and a
performance piece of his choosing.
"I didn't have any technical train-
ing," Raymond said - but he did read
into the subject, and he did have Pro
Tools ("kind of the big name in the
recording industry," he explained).
Able to quickly compile the requisite
pieces from his personal computer
noodlings, Raymond' applied one
month before the MT&D deadline and
was accepted.
That sort of gradual and casual
introduction into the music production
world isn't specific to Raymond. Mack-
lin Underdown, a PAT sophomore, also
fell into recording on his own, and has

yet to experience a more polished pro-
duction style.
"I've never personally recorded in
a studio or been at a recording session
at a really nice studio - all the stuff I
did growing up was in my bedroom,"
Underdown said. "I bought a computer
and some software and a microphone
and was just kind of doing my own
thing."
Some PAT majors start off with even
less in the way of state-of-the-art tech-
nology - although Raymond pointed
out that nowadays, recording equip-
ment is cheaper than ever before.
"Once (recording techniques)
switched from analog to digital, it was
a lot more accessible to a lot more peo-
ple, because the prices came down,"
Raymond said. "Everybody can have
a MacBook with GarageBand and get
started that way, just like I did, and you
don't really have to own anything to do
something in GarageBand.
"I definitely think that it's tougher
if you don't have the resources to get
started on, but there are kids who have
come here that don't own any equip-
ment, or haven't owned any equip-
ment."
What Raymond, Underdown and
many other PAT majors did have, how-
ever, was a solid background in math
and science, and a desire to integrate
practical academics into an artistic
course of study.

expressed pride in being part of the

Joaquin Phoenix has proven

it because Phoenix dedicated two
years of his life to make it, and he
did an excellent job at convincing
us that he was finished with act-
ing, all while ironically employ-
ing the damnedest acting chops
we've ever seen from him. "I'm

od acting, and it may very well
become one of the definitive cult
classics of our generation.

Phoenix's decline from a hand-

in films like "Gladiator," "Walk the

speculate about the reason for his
abrupt retirement, only Phoenix's

Any discerning audience mem-
ber should recognize the subtle-
ties that hint at a mockumentary.
Several of the situations Phoenix
finds himself in (as well as the
lighting and dialogue that accom-
pany them) suggest that the events
were entirely preconceived. Even
so, the line between fact and fiction
is blurred just enough to confound
those who knew the fallacious
nature of the whole affair before
they had even breached the doors
of the theater.
This particular work is brilliant
due neither to its cinematography
nor its direction. Succinctly put,

Through a classic tiger-meets-
girl tale, Charlaine Harris con-
structs a haunting narrative about
love, lust and zoology. And vam-
pires. The plot centers on lonely
widow Karen Nightgown and the
evening her life changed forever.
During one of her nightly Grieve
Strolls, Karen takes a shortcut
through the local golf course.
But wait! Something's amiss. As
the stars come out, Karen hears
some distressing growls emitting
from the underbrush. Investigat-
ing, she finds a kitten trapped in
a rusty beaver trap and promptly
rescues it.
But Karen is about to find out
this little kitty's got a secret. After
Karen nurses it back to health, the
kitten reveals its true form - a
500-pound Bengal tiger! Karen is
terrified at first, but soon the two
become the best of pals, hatching
schemes and solving mysteries
all over their sleepy Midwestern
town. That is, until vampires get

wind of their recent exploits and
try to make sure Karen and Clem
(Karen's name for the tiger, after
her late husband) are never heard
from again. Oh, and Clem can fly.
Harris does many things right
with "Definitely Dead," the eighth
novel in her "Tigers and Dames"
series. As we have come to expect
with Harris, her plot and pac-
ing skills take a backseat to the
extraordinarily detailed tiger
facts she includes on every page
(her description of the physiol-
ogy of a flying tiger is particularly
exquisite). However, she treats
the vampires with disdain, never

ook out! The Jolly Pump-
kin, brewery-turned-sen-
sational-snacking-spot,
is serving up a smackdown and
shaking up
Main Street's
somewhat
stagnant rep-
ertoire. Not to
hate on Main
- it's clear-
ly a fixture
of the Ann LILA
Arbor food KALICK
scene and a
prime, if not
solo, player in the city's upscale
dining selection. Yet despite its
abundance of options and rela-
tive accessibility to community
members, you won't find many
students there grabbing dinner
on a typical Friday or Saturday
night.
Why not? The traditional
dichotomy between Main Street
and campus-area cuisine options
may be due to distance. "I have
class in an hour, therefore I am
going to eat Jimmy John's for
lunch." However, we can't ignore
the price point. I mainly avoid
Main because my pockets aren't
that deep. Classic statements like
"I'm going to eat dinner on Main
because the parents are in town"
or an overheard recounting of
a ludicrously expensive date at
Chop House or Gratzi only fur-
ther stigmatize Main's pricey
appeal.
The Jolly Pumpkin might
be starting to bridge this gap.
Having opened in Ann Arbor in
Sept. 2009, it's the most recent
addition to an increasingly suc-
cessful Jolly Pumpkin fran-
chise, already well established
* in Michigan with its brewery in
Dexter and restaurant, brewery
and distillery in Traverse City.
It's rapidly asserting itself as a
worthy opponent to compete
with another local favorite just
off Main, Arbor Brewing Com-
pany.
Like ABC, the Jolly Pumpkin
brews its own. Unlike ABC, its
food is excellent. Solid enough
to comfort but not so heavy
that it weighs you down, the
menu is secretly sophisticated.
Don't be fooled by the category
breakdown advertising a mod-
est spread of appetizers, sand-
wiches, salads and pizzas. The
Jolly Pumpkin's take on cuisine
is a master mix of some Ameri-
can classics, with twists as fresh
as their ingredients (collected
daily from local markets). Try
the truffled French fries or the
"Not Just a BLT" BLT featuring
applewood-smoked bacon, aru-

gula, roasted tomatoes, house-
made mozzarella and salsa verde
on toasted farm bread.
Boo! The Jolly Pumpkin
will scare you with how strong
its salad game is. The grilled
romaine - with croutons made
from layers of thinly sliced pota-
toes joined together by cream
then lightly breaded - is about
as decadent as they come. These
will haunt you in the great-
est way. Vegetarian and vegan
options accommodate just about
any dietary need. And, the brew-
ery provides a not-so-short list of
award-winning in-house beers
to accompany any dish.
An eclectic atmosphere and
staff complement the equally
eclectic menu. Inside, the walls
are a pale burnt orange punc-
tuated by quirky paintings and
family photos. Multi-hued glass
beads hang like drops off of cast
iron rods as lighting over the
booths and cast shadows on a
wooden statue of a lion sipping
a beer above the bar. Two mas-
sive chandeliers whimsically
constructed from cooking uten-
sils hang at either end of the
caf6, further emphasizing the
comfortable yet funky vibes the
Jolly Pumpkin so effortlessly
emits.
The service is friendly,
approachable and helpful, mean-
ing the waiter will tell you his
real feelings about the horse-
radish beet soup special. The
bartender is probably wearing a
Tigers hat as he wipes down the
cherry wood counter. Your host-
ess has tattoo sleeves and a sweet
smile.
If you can find it, modestly
nestled among some of the loud-
er facades, make sure to stop in.
Good food and
great brew form
a scary-good
combination.
The prices are surprisingly mod-
erate, especially for lunch. It's
not necessarily a $4 sandwich
from Potbelly, but only a stone's
throw away from the $8 you'd
spend on a Reuben from Amer's.
The Jolly Pumpkin is perfectly
poised to bring more student foot
traffic to Main.

Navigating a pair of
cartographical collections
at 'U' libraries
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Senior Arts Editor
Whether you realize it or not, maps likely got
you to where you are today. You've quizzically
stared at the impossible-to-fold ones in your car
on the side of the road, you've labeled states and
capitols on a colorful America in grade school and
you've been saved many times from first-day late-
ness by the "you are here" labels on the plaques
in academic buildings. And while you appreciate
topographical depictions when they point you in
the right direction, you might not stop and think
about them much otherwise.
But at the University, there are people who see
maps for so much more than their surface appli-
cation. They create culture so big there are two
major cartography collections on campus: the
Map Library in Hatcher Graduate Library and
the collection in the William L. Clements Library.
Here, maps are valued as works of art.
Founded in 1923, the Clements Library started
with alum and former regent William L. Cle-
ments's personal collection of historic documents
and manuscripts, which contained several hun-
dred maps. Clements made a fortune supplying
materials for the construction of the Panama
Canal and combed auctions of private librar-
ies and estate sales of aristocrats to obtain his
obscenely large collection. The Clements Library
has expanded greatly in the past 87 years and is
now home to 30,000 charts of the Americas dat-
ing from the 15th century to the 20th. Nearly
every pre-1820 map of the Americas is included
among the originals and copies that form the col-
lection, which is accessible for student observa-
tion through appointment.
"The map collection at Clements is a more
historical map collection," said Brian Dunnigan,
curator of the Clements collection. "It documents
the growth and cartographic knowledge of the
Americas from the time of Columbus up until, for
the most part, about 1900."
While old maps are often valued for their his-

torical significance, many also contain ornate
designs, giving them significant artistic value as
well.
"I would especially say for the manuscript
maps, they are decorative - they are certainly
functional for the most part - but they are defi-
nitely a form of art," Dunnigan said.
Long before GPS and satellites, maps were
often drawn and colored by hand. Pictures were
used to denote landmarks and land ownership or
simply to add a little flair to the document. Ships
were placed in the harbors and oceans, windmills
graced the countrysides and yellows, reds and
blues marked divided properties. Certainly, you
don't find this ornamentation on your TomTom

or Garmin.
"You can see that with printed maps, they get
more scientific as you get into the late 18th, early
19th century," Dunnigan said. "They start to lose
alot ofthe decorativeelements thatyousee onthe
earlier maps."
While it's true that over time maps get more
factual and less creative, it can still be argued
that modern maps retain a sense of aesthetics and
illustrate cultural relevance.
"I want to say (maps) stopped being art at a
certain time, but they didn't," said Tim Utter, the
access and information services librarian for the
Map Library at Hatcher Graduate Library. "What

Pledging creativity: Artsy Greeks
By Emma Jeszke I Daily Arts Writer
Some University students might exclusively associate Greek Life with the keg-induced madness that
becomes Hill St. every football Saturday. What you may not be aware of, though, is a vibrant (albeit
quiet) side to the Greek system that focuses on the spreading and sharing of what its members love: art.

Daily Arts explores Alpha Rho
Chi and Kappa Kappa Psi - two
co-ed, professional, arts-focused
fraternities on campus doing just
that.
Though Alpha Rho Chi and
Kappa Kappa Psi both lack an offi-
cial frat house with bawdy parties,
their presence is still very visible
in the Greek scene. Through their
respective organizations, architec-
tural and musical outreach stays
alive on campus, adding another
layer of color to the Ann Arbor's
artistic - and Greek - community.
aa
APX
Alpha Rho Chi, founded in 1914
by two architecture societies from
the Universities of Michigan and
Illinois, is a nationwide fraternity
for those interested in architecture
and the "allied arts," which include
related design fields like industrial
engineering and civil engineering.
"What we aim to do is create and

foster both a social and professional
relationship and community with
students within the school and
within the University setting," said
Jordan Buckner, president of Alpha
Rho Chi. "We work with students
and the University to put on pro-
grams and events that extend the
architectural experience outside of
the classroom."
Through last week's program,
called "Dinosaurs on the Diag,"
Alpha Rho Chi extended the archi-
tectural experience all the way
from the North Campus classroom
to Central Campus. Large wooden
dinosaurs on the Diag transformed
the normally monotonous, open
area into a dynamic Jurassic land.
The various dinosaur structures
were completely designed and con-
structed by architecture students.
"One thingthat we are interested
in ... is gaining exposure to people,
especially on Central Campus,
about architecture and some of the
other design fields that they don't
normally have exposure to," Buck-
ner said. "So one of the goals of the
'Dinosaurs on the Diag' program
is to create a space or environment
and a re-envisioning of the Central
Campus Diag space to get people to
look at it differently.
"The great thing about architec-
ture, too, is that it's not just about
designing buildings," he said. "It's
designing spaces, spaces that can
be formative and kind of emotion-
al for people ton. We get to build
something with our hands, we get
to design it with our hands and
everything we do is kind of our own
creative process."
Alpha Rho Chi uses architec-

ture as a means of outreach in
other ways, too. This past summer,
the fraternity participated in the
building of new playgrounds for a
Detroit elementary school by help-
ing plan and create the structures.
In October, the group is taking part
in a Michigan Habitat for Human-
ity build.
Although Buckner said the fra-
ternity strives to bring its art to
others who aren't familiar with it,

he also feels that Alpha Rho Chi is
important because of the relation-
ships it fosters between its mem-
bers.
"(Alpha Rho Chi) provides a
catalyst to form strong friendships
and relationships to people with
the same interests as me," Buck-
ner said, "connections that will not
only last though college, but also
throughout the rest of my life."

happened is maps started to be more
scientific. In a way, science kind of
took over, and that's fine because
the maps are more accurate, and
that's great and very important. You
want to have an accurate map."
The Map Library where Utter
works is on the top floor of the
Hatcher. The lesser-known room on
campus is full of wide filing cabinets
with shallow shelves for maps of all
sizes. It hosts the largest collection
of maps in the state, with more than
320,000 maps (celestial, topograph-
ical, electronic and more) and 8,000

atlases, both historic and modern.
"Here at Hatcher, we collect any
kind of map, anything that has to do
with maps - anything," Utter said.
"It could be a baseball with a map on
it. We have playing cards with maps.
We have a set of playing cards from
the late 1600s with maps on it."
According to Utter, we can learn
just as much from modern maps
made in the lastcentury as ones that
a hundreds of years old.
"Some of my favorite maps are
road maps from the 1920s, '30s and
'40s -cthe early years of the automo-
bile," Utter explained. "And what is
really interesting to me are some of
the advertisements and images of

"There is a problem today, where

Brusati specializes in visual cul-
ture of the Netherlands - where
many cartographic advancements
took place, including the creation
of the famous Mercator projection
by Flemish cartographer Gerar-
dus Mercator. Brusati rejects the
notion that art and science cannot
intermingle, explaining that while
maps are more likely to be seen in
a history museum than an art gal-
lery, there was a time when the dis-
tinction between the two wasn't so
obvious.
"In history, scientists either
needed artists or needed to be art-

believes maps are making a come-

their historic, educational and artis-
tic value.
"I obviously love maps, and I'm
really excited now because maps
seem to be very popular again,
which is really nice," Utter said.
"We're getting a lot more use and
especially by artists. We've prob-

ably talked to five or six different art
classes over the school year."
While you're surely already
familiar with the practical applica-
tions of maps and atlases, the col-
lections at Clements and Hatcher
encourage the public to rediscover
maps and develop an apprecia-
tion for cartography in the artistic
sphere.
"People say art is self-expression,
art is beauty," Brusati said. "But
art is also truth and there is a lot of
truth in maps."

PAT

schools because of its position within a
larger, well respected university.
"I'm still getting a full degree from the
University of Michigan, and so it's a little
bit more well rounded than just, 'I went
to a trade school, here's what I learned,'"
Raymond said.
Underdown pointed specifically to the
University's four-year bachelor's degree
program as a reason to choose PAT; small-
er recording technology programs tend to
offer two-year associate's degrees.
"There are a few schools that have elec-
tronic music degrees, or they have sound
recording and production degrees," Corey
said. But the University's program means
more.
"What really makes it unique is the fact
that it's interdisciplinary, and that it's
where we're situated - the fact that we're
on the Michigan campus, the fact that
we're in a school of music that has 1,000
students, and that (PAT) students get to
take classes in Engineering and Screen
Arts & Cultures and Art & Design."
Though Performing Arts Technology
majors cross disciplines in their studies,
they don't all go about it in the same way.
PAT is divided into four tracks, each with
its own focus and set of expectations -
prospective freshmen apply to one track
specifically, but it's possible to switch
once accepted.
Curriculum A requires that its stu-
dents take lessons in voice or some classi-
cal instrument. It's the only PAT track to
award graduates with a bachelor of music.
Tracks B and C both give bachelor of fine
arts degrees.
"B and C have quite a bit of overlap,
except that I would say B concentrates a
little bit more on music and C lets students
have a little more flexibility in what they
can concentrate on," Corey explained.
"It's not just music as performance art,
it's any interactive art that you can think
of: installations, media art, stuff like
that," Essl said of track C.
PAT D gives a bachelor of science in
sound engineering degree and is a popu-
lar choice among aspiring music produc-
ers and audio designers. Raymond is in
track D; Underdown is in B but hoping to
switch to C.
Combined, the four PAT tracks have
just 80 students, but the gender ratio is
heavily skewed.

"It's probably 15-percent female to
85-percent male," Corey estimated, but
"my sense is that I'm getting more inqui-
ries from prospective female students
this year than before."
Raymond gets to see a good cross-sec-
tion of the PAT program outside of class.
The chair of the University's student sec-
tion of the international Audio Engineer-
ing Society, Raymond noted that most
attendees at AES-sponsored workshops
are students in PAT.
The workshops Raymond helps plan
give PAT students (and anyone else inter-
ested) the opportunity to learn more
about the audio production world outside
of school. Last semester, the club invited
Michael Gould and Joseph Gramley, per-
cussion professors in the school of MT&D,
to speak.
"They came over and held a drum-tun-
ing workshop in the audio studio," Ray-
mond said, "and talked about preparing
drums for recording, and how to get the
best sound out of them." At other work-
shops, company representatives from
Yamaha and Sound Studio Logic have
showed off new products and features for
the AES group.
AES is one way for PAT students to
figure out where to go after graduation.
As they will discover, there are lots of
options out there waiting for them once
they've earned their degrees.
Engineering a Job
Graduates with creative arts degrees
often find themselves face-to-face with a
fiercely competitive job market in which
hiring decisions are based heavily on sub-
jectivity. Rooted in hard science as much
as art, PAT leaves its graduates with
something more practical and career-
applicable.
"Just listening and learning to listen,
and to hear things and evaluate some of
those qualities is a big piece of the whole
program," said Jeff Vautin, who graduat-
ed in December 2006 and now works for
Bose Corporation.
After spending three years doing
acoustic and electrical design on head-
phones, Vautin now works on audio sys-
tems for cars.
"In the PAT program I was looking at
(music) from the compositional end of
it - when you're putting together a mix
that somebody's going to listen to, how
do you want to present all that informa-
tion," Vautin said. "And now I'm looking
at it from the other end. I'm looking at the

PAT concentrators can choose among four different tracks, each with its own curriculum.

playback - when somebody goes to play
back a mix somebody's made, how can we
present it as accurately as possible. So it's
a very related challenge, but coming at it
from a different angle."
While there are certain PAT skills that
Vautin uses daily at work - specifically
from the timbral ear training class he
took with Corey - he attributes much of
his quick job-hunt success to his second
major, electrical engineering. Accord-
ing to Vautin, electrical engineering was
more attractive to employers because
they got it - whereas with PAT, the sub-
ject and name of the department are both
fairly new and specific to the 'U,' and thus
confusing to companies.
"Until the sound engineering program,
the Performing Arts Technology curricu-
lum, is better understood, that will be a
limitation of it - employers not knowing
exactly what it entails and the similarities
between it and its overlap with electrical
engineering," Vautin said.
Michael Eisenberg never had to face
that limitation. Also a member of the class
of 2006, Eisenberg found employment
instantly, with nothing but a BFA from PAT
C. Eisenberg, then in Raymond's current
position heading AES at the University,
traveled to New York for an AES convention
over spring break of his senior year.
"I was told to meet Abe Jacob, who was

the man who kind of was able to get the
title of sound designer toa theater," he said.
"And he wanted me to come to New York
and work for him, soI made the move."
Eisenberg now does theatrical sound
design and engineering in NYC. Cur-
rently, he's doing sound engineering for
the drag-queen musical "La Cage aux
Folles" on Broadway and the Hitchcock
adaptation "The 39 Steps" off-Broadway.
As associate designer, he's working on
a revival of a Mamet play, "A Life in the
Theater," and a grown-up "Alice in Won-
derland" sequel musical called "Won-
derland," which will begin previews on
Broadway in March.
"The designer will say, 'I want to do
that,' and the associate will say, 'OK,
this is how we do that,' " Eisenberg said,
describing his various jobs. "The sound
engineer is the one managing the crew
and making sure everything happens
properly."
As with Vautin, it's the general Per-
forming Arts Technology mentality that
Eisenberg finds most useful to him now.
"Michigan's audio program doesn't
focus on anything related to what I do," he
said. "However, the principles in every-
thing that they teach all wrap around and
directly affect what I like to do. So it was
great preparation to be able to go through
all of (PAT) and basically know how to
listen."
Raymond and Underdown don't know
where they'll be in a few years' time. But
they've got plenty of options: Accord-
ing to Corey, recent PAT grads have gone
on to work in recording engineering, in
website design, with the microphone
company Shure and with the digital sig-
nal processing company Analog Devices,
among other things.
"You can even go into the (video game)
industry and make the, you know, squeaky
sounds that you need for the games," said
Essl.
Back in Professor Furr's classroom,
LSA junior Adam Fink says he'd like to
switch into the Performing Arts Tech-
nology program if possible. But most of
Furr's students aren't bound for the vid-
eo-game squeak industry or the behind-
the-scenes Broadway life.
In PAT 201, they're getting just a taste
of what Raymond, Underdown and the
rest of the PAT majors do every day. But
as Furr finishes her explanation of the
assignment and the class immediately
starts fiddling with synthesizer key-
boards and controls, it's clear that while
the students are still learning about com-
puter music techniques, they're com-
pletely absorbed in this tech-art hybrid of
a subject.

KKNV
Fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi and sister
sorority Tau Beta Sigma help out any and
all band organizations - University band,
campus band, marching band, etc. - with
a focus on expanding musicianship across
campus.
"We create a brotherhood within the
band of people, people who want to ser-
vice the band ... and we are also here to
create a better social environment for
people in the band," said Sierra Cain,
president of Kappa Kappa Psi. Cain plays
trombone in the Marching Band.
Members of Kappa Kappa Psi act as
souped-up cheerleaders for music orga-
nizations on campus. Part of the frater-
nity's purpose stems from the hope that
their efforts will bring more awareness of
student musicians' presence and, in turn,
benefit everyone.
"Music is one of those things that's all-
encompassing," said Alexandra Genia,
vice president of Kappa Kappa Psi and
trombonist in the marching band. "It
sounds really cheesy to say it's a language
that everybody understands, but it's true.
So by servicing the different band orga-
nizations on campus, we are allowing
those bands to put forth their best effort
in order to create this music and pass it off
to other people.
"For example, the School of Music's
various ensembles actually have free con-
certs that you can basically walk into and
watch," Genia added. "And I kid you not,
some of this music is incredibly beauti-
ful, it's absolutely wonderful ... It's one of
those great college experiences that you
can only get by showing up."
Recently, the fraternity bought new
televisions for Revelli Hall, the band
headquarters on Hoover Street.
"Instead ofgettingthis terrible presen-
tation on a crappy TV, now things look a
little slicker," Genia said.
The fraternity aids in band recruit-
ment and holds smaller-scale morale-
boosters to keep student musicians happy,
including an annual ice cream social for
the marching band. Cain also explained
that when things start to get stressful,
like during long rehearsals in the rain,
it's always members of Kappa Kappa Psi
keeping people positive and upbeat.
Kappa Kappa Psi is interested in
extending its musical outreach beyond
the University. Last year, the group start-
ed the Musical Outreach Program, which
