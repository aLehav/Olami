ana: number zero, Zack
Nooooooooo-vak.
Bobb Vergiels' voice cracked
slightly as he said it, adding
the extra umph that the occa-
sion deserved. The game hadn't
even started yet, but as Novak
approached midcourt to shake
William Buford's hand, the
crowd was already louder than it
had been all season.
Then the lights came on,
ending the build-up to the most
publicized Michigan basketball
game of the season - perhaps
the milenium. The questions
about Ohio State were over.
ESPN's College GameDay set
- which attracted a national
television audience to Ann
Arbor on Saturday morning and
night - had been whisked away

from center court. The fans, who
began lining up at 11 p.m. on Fri-
day, were in their seats.
And at 9:05 p.m., the ball
tipped off, and none of the hoop-
la mattered. Just Novak, nine
other players, two hoops and a
ball. Just a basketball game -
but so much more.
Zack Novak planted his feet,
put his hands up, and just two
minutes into the game, estab-
lished the area just outside the
key on Crisler's floor as his own.
National Player of the Year can-
didate Jared Sullinger came bar-
reling in with the ball, looking to
even the score at two apiece.
It was a classic matchup of
talent versus grit. Sullinger, the
best player on the best team
in the conference, was a top-
three recruit coming out of high

school. Novak, the heart and
soul of a team fighting to stay in
the race for a conference cham-

At first,

basket sent Novak sprawling
to the floor. But then, official
Mike Kitts emerged, thrusting
his arm in front of his body. As
he has done so many times in

his career, Novak had drawn a
charge.
When John Beilein was hired
in 2007, skeptics said he'd never
succeed in the Big Ten. Beilein's
offense was synonymous with
finesse, and his lack of emphasis
on rebounding meant he'd never
make it outside the Big East.
But there was the undersized
Novak, a guard, winninga battle
against a future NBA lottery
pick with his effort alone. It
was just another play for Novak,
another play for the Michigan
defense that's become one of the
toughest to play against in the
conference.

North Korea threatens
attack on South Korea

Tensions rise over
scheduled military
drills
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - North Korea will launch
"merciless" strikes if South
Korea goes through with planned
live-fire drills today in a disputed
front-line area near their dis-
puted sea border, a North Korean

officer warned in an interview
with The Associated Press.
North Korea doesn't want a
war but its people are always
ready to "dedicate their blood to
defend their inviolable territory,"
officer Sin Chol Ung from the
North"s Korean People's Security
Forces told AP yesterday as South
Korean troops prepared to hold
the drills in an area that was the
target of a deadly artillery attack
in 2010.


South Korea is scheduled
to stage regular one-day artil-
lery drills today from front-line
islands in waters off the western
coast that North Korea claims
as its territory. South Korea
informed Pyongyang of the train-
ing plan yesterday, South Korea's
Joint Chiefs of Staff said in Seoul.
Soon after, Pyongyang's mili-
tary called the drills a "premedi-
tated military provocation" and
warned the South it would retali-
ate for an attack on its territory.
North Korea urged civilians liv-
ing or working on the islands to
evacuate before the drills begin,
the western military command
said in a statement carried by the
North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
The threat of an artillery
attack like the one that killed
four South Koreans in Novem-
ber 2010 after a similar exchange
between the two Koreas comes
two months after the death of
leader Kim Jong Il and as his son
Kim Jong Un takes the helm of
the nation of 24 million.

ty quickly that (students)
were not getting their needs
met," Carbone said.
Carbone said one of the main
goals of the Body-Peace Corps
is to raise awareness about the
prevalence of eating disorders
on campus.
"On most college campuses,
the rates of eating disorders are
double that of the general popu-
lation," Carbone said. "On our
campus, it's close to one in four
students (who) have a diagnos-
able eating disorder."
Another major focus of
the organization is improv-
ing media literacy of body
image among students that
are swarmed with depictions
of ideal body shapes on popu-
lar television programs and in
magazines.
"What I find is a lot of stu-
dents come to campus having
seen MTV's Spring Break ... all
these commercials and all these
television shows that give you
this one-size-fits-all image of
what a college experience is
supposed to look like and what
beauty is supposed to look like,"
Carbone said.
Carbon said the goal of the

Body-Peace Corps is to arm stu-
dents with the ability to recog-
nize the media's "thin ideal" as
unrealistic and help them real-
ize that individuals don't have
to be in perfect form in order to
be healthy.
As part of its Eating Disorder
Awareness Month, the orga-
nization sponsored the Love
Your Body Fair last Tuesday in
the Michigan Union. Students
enjoyed free food, Valentine's
Day giveaways, henna art, mas-
sages and a space for discussion
regarding disorders.
"We're really wanting to
change the dialogue," Carbone
said.
LSA junior Jessica Harper,
outreach coordinator for the
organization, echoed Carbone's
emphasis on the importance of
discussion.
"We can't make a change
without starting the conversa-
tion first," Harper said.
Along with the Love Your
Body Fair, the Body-Peace
Corps has sponsored events
throughout February such as
movie screenings and yoga, Tai
Chi and informational work-
shops. This fall, it plans to team
up with the National EatingDis-
orders Association and hold a
NEDA Walk to raise money and
increase awareness.

At an event held at UHS on
Thursday, UHS dietician Julie
Stocks spoke to about eight stu-
dents regarding mindful eating.
Stocks encouraged students to
completely "unplug" while eat-
ing, listen to natural hunger
signals and interact with food
using all five senses.
By doing so, she said students
will be ableto better separate
their physical and emotional
relationships with food, ulti-
mately leading to a better and
healthy understanding of food
as fuel for the body.
In an interview after the
event, Stocks said she attributes
the cause of eating disorders
among college students to a
combination of things.
"We know that the comorbids
of high anxiety and some other
mental health struggles already
exist," Stocks said. "Then you
add the pressure cooker of col-
lege, and it might be just enough
to flip a switch to have the 'I
need to control something' slip
over into eating."
Rackham student Veronica
Rabelo said she came to the
event to learn more about mind-
ful eating.
"It can be hard to find that
work-life balance," she said.
"Mindfulness is a powerful
thing anyone can learn."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Red Wings win
23rd in a row at
Joe Louis Arena
The Detroit Red Wings are
losing track of how many games
in a row they've won at home.
Detroit won its 23rd straight
at Joe Louis Arena, setting an
NHL multiple-season mark for
home dominance by holding on
to beat the San Jose Sharks 3-2
yesterday.
"Where are we at with the
streak?" asked Drew Miller, who
scored for the Red Wings. "The
streak is cool, but we're more
concerned with how we're play-
ing and to keep our spot in the
race."
The Red Wings won their
sixth straight game, all in a
homestand, and have an NHL-
high 84 points.
Detroit, which broke the
league's single-season record of
20 on Tuesday, surpassed the 22
wins in a row the Boston Bruins
had over two seasons more than
eight decades ago.

ICE agent fights
for gun, shoots,
kills supervisor
A federal agent accused of
shooting a supervisor engaged
" in a serious struggle for his gun
with another colleague who sub-
sequently shot and killed him, an
official said.
The shooting occurred after
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agent Ezequiel Gar-
cia discussed his job performance
with the agency's second-in-com-
mand in the Los Angeles region,
ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice
said Saturday.
Another agent who attended
the discussion and had just left
the office rushed back and burst
in to disarm Garcia after the shots
rang out.
"There was avery, very intense
struggle," Kice said. "They were
physically struggling over the
gun."
The agent eventually drew his
own gun and shot Garcia, Kice
said. ICE is not releasing the
agent's name.
RIGA, Latvia
Latvian voters
reject Russian as
national language
Latvian voters resoundingly
rejected a proposal to give offi-
cial status to Russian, the moth-
er tongue of their former Soviet
occupiers, though the defeated
referendum Saturday is expect-
ed to leave scars on an already
divided society.
Russian is the first language
* for about one-third of the Bal-
tic country's 2.1 million people,
and many of them would like to
accord official status to the Ian-

guage to reverse what they claim
has been 20 years of discrimina-
tion.
But for ethnic Latvians,
the referendum was a brazen
attempt to encroach on Lat-
via's independence, which was
restored two decades ago after
a half-century of occupation
by the Soviet Union following
World War II.

at about 2 a.m. in a high-security
section of a prison in the city of
Apodaca outside the northern

Several inmates attacked

Domene said. Forty-four people

control of the prison a couple of
hours later, he said.

Moves comes after
EU imposed tough
sanctions last
month
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran
has halted oil shipments to Brit-
ain and France, the Oil Ministry
said yesterday, in an apparent
pre-emptive blow against the
European Union after the bloc
imposed sanctions on Iran's cru-
cial fuel exports.
The EU imposed tough sanc-
tions against Iran last month,
which included a freeze of the
country's central bank assets
and an oil embargo set to begin
in July. Iran's Oil Minister Ros-
tam Qassemi had warned earlier
this month that Tehran could
cut off oil exports to "hostile"
European nations. The 27-nation
EU accounts for about18 percent
of Iran's oil exports.
However, the Iranian action
was not likely to have any signif-
icant direct impact on European
supplies because both Britain
and France had already moved
last year to sharply curtail oil
purchases from Tehran to less
than 3 percent of their daily
needs.
The EU sanctions, along

with other punitive measures
imposed by the U.S., are part of
Western efforts to derail Iran's
disputed nuclear program,
which the West fears is aimed
at developing atomic weapons.
Iran denies the charges, and
says its program is for peaceful
purposes.
The spokesman for Iran's
Oil Ministry, Ali Reza Nikzad-
Rahbar, said on the ministry's
website yesterday that "crude
oil exports to British and French
companies have been halted."
"We have our own customers
and have no problem to sell and
export our crude oil to new cus-
tomers," he said.
Britain's Foreign Office
declined comment, and there
was no immediate response
from French officials.
The semiofficial Mehr news
agency said exports were sus-
pended to the two countries
yesterday. It also said the
National Iranian Oil Company
has sent letters to some Euro-
pean refineries with an ulti-
matum to either sign long-term
contracts of two to five years or
be cut off.
Mehr did not specify which
countries were sent the ulti-
matum, but Spain, Italy and
Greece are among Europe's big-
gest buyers of Iranian oil.

British fugitive caught
hiding in rural Missouri

Suspect of
laundering $1.5M
on run since 1993
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -
On the surface, Edward Maher
and his wife appeared to enjoy
a comfortable middle-class life.
They had homes in quiet neigh-
borhoods, drove late-model
cars and took occasional week-
end trips. They raised two sons.
But beneath that veneer lay
a darker past: Maher was an
international fugitive - wanted
in Britain on allegations that he
stole a fortune worth $1.5 mil-
lion back in 1993 while work-
ing as a security guard for an
armored truck company.

When he was captured in
rural Missouri, the suspect
dubbed "Fast Eddie" by the
British media had managed
to evade arrest for nearly two
decades. Public records and
interviews with neighbors sug-
gest he did so mostly by living
an inconspicuous life of unre-
markable jobs and making
frequent, sometimes abrupt
cross-country moves.
Maher's adult son, Lee,
claims his parents did not tell
him anything about their real
identities until shortly before
his father was arrested Feb. 8.
"I had just found out that
my life is ... not anything that I
thought it was," the 23-year-old
Maher said in a phone inter-
view.

Value editorial freedom
Business interests shouldn't dictate coverage
ree speech is an integral aspect of the American Dream. It's
possibly the first and most utilized right in the United States,
and one that is often taken for granted. It's inappropriate for
any city to lose this basic right. If nowhere else, the city of Philadel-
phia should remember that. The Liberty Bell and the University of
Pennsylvania, founded by Benjamin Franklin, are daily reminders of
it. The coming sale and subsequent censoring of the city's newspapers
like The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News is a
significant misstep away from all that the city represents. News and
media within Philadelphia must remain reliable. Newspapers must
stay objective as an integral part of free society despite whatever eco-
nomic or political happenings are going on behind the scenes.


I don't know why we're spending all this time
talking about (marriage equality)."
- Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said on NBC's "Meet the Press" when he was
asked if the nation should be discussing same-sex marraige.
FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR I
The words of others

Since the Philadelphia Media Network
announced that it would be up for sale,
there's been a significant amount of inter-
est in purchasing the network - consisting
of The Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.
com. The largest and most powerful source
is a group of executive Democratic investors,
led by Ed Rendell, the former Philadelphia
mayor, former governor of Pennsylvania and
chairman of the Democratic National Com-
mittee. Last week, CEO and Publisher of the
Philadelphia Media Network Gregory Osberg
announced within the company that he
would oversee all articles produced regard-
ing the sale of the company. He went on to say
that if any ran without his personal approval,
those involved would be fired, including both
the writers and editors.
The sale and corresponding censoring of
the newspaper stems from a concern within
the company itself. Older forms of publishing
specifically newspapers, have had trouble
coping with and adjusting to an increasing-
ly online and decreasingly profitable busi-
ness model. Twitter, the "blogosphere" and
24-hour cable news cycles have changed the
game. It's become progressively harder for
newspapers to reach a disappearing niche.
The censorship of articles to favor certain

prospective buyers is an attempt on the part
of the management to keep both public con-
cern and private fervor to a minimum until
the deal goes through.
However, that concern is not an excuse to
censor what should be public information.
Newspapers, the only type of business men-
tioned in the Constitution, cannot simply sell
their content or focus to the highest bidder.
The spread of information is a crucial institu-
tion ina democratic system. It keeps the public
knowledgeable and institutions reliable and
accountable. Investment in media is an invest-
ment in literary freedom and free speech, not
an attempt to facilitate personal interests and
intentions of the buyers within society. This is
especially true, and a bit unnerving, when the
buyers are well-known political bosses.
It's unfortunate that the print media indus-
try is in a current dire financial situation. That
doesn't mean, however, that editors should cen-
sor or bias their content and mission to accom-
modate financial interests. It's impossible to
say newspapers are without bias or any con-
flict of interests, but they must do everything
within their power to retain editorial integrity.
In a political era fraughtwith wealthy lobbying
interests, journalism must find a way to retain
its objective and integral role.

Being responsible for your own
words is hard enough, but it's noth-
ing compared to being responsible
for the words of others. Yet, that is
a large part of the everyday task of
all Michigan Daily editors. Unsur-
prisingly, things don't always go
smoothly.
Last week, a student brought to
my attention an op-ed viewpoint
submission he had made to the
editorial page. The student was
annoyed that the ultimate version
of the viewpoint that was printed
mangled his apparent thesis - a
result of a haphazard and drastic
cutting process, he said. There's no
doubt that something went wrong
in editing that particular piece,
and I thought I'd use that issue to
launch a broader discussion of the
Daily's editing process.
Editors of every section of this
paper have the responsibility of
revising and perfecting the work
of staff writers in their sections.
Editorial page editors have an
added responsibility of review-
ing and editing submissions made
by outsiders, such as viewpoints
and letters to the editor. The bal-
ance between allowing the writer's
voice to come through and printing
the most polished piece possible is
a tough one to navigate. Yet both
responsibilities are immensely
important.
I remember that in my years as
an arts writer, there was no more
oppressive a feeling than picking
up the Daily before class one morn-
ing and finding that a movie review
I had spent hours working on had
been squished into a tiny space,
chopped viciously and robbed of all
character. Though I learned to deal
with it better, that used to happen
to me even as a senior writer.

I'm sure writers in every section
of this paper know what I'm talk-
ing about. While there are all sorts
of people writing for the Daily,
they have one thing in common:
they consider writing to be their
strength. So, to have an article be
completely rewritten in editing can
be a maddening occurrence. Mad-
dening, but often necessary.
As writers (hopefully) learn
quickly, there is no submission
that can't be improved by a smart,
focused editor. And if the writer
can be involved in the editing pro-
cess, then that's even better - not
only does the piece itself improve,
but the writer also learns lessons to
be applied in future work.
Collaborative editing with staff
writers should be practiced in
every section of this paper as much
as possible. But, in addition to
being a staff writer, I was also an
editor, so I can see the other side
of this coin too. A newspaper has
deadlines, and, as student-jour-
nalists, editors are always shorton
time. There won't always be time
to sit down with a writer to do a
collaborative edit, and often, it can
seem like just a tedious addition to
daily editing duties.
I fought that mindset as an edi-
tor myself, so I know the impor-
tance of overcoming it. At a student
newspaper, the mission is not just
to cover the news and provide
commentary, but also to improve
as writers and journalists, and
then pass on what you learn to the
next class of writers. The tedium
of teaching the proper way to do
things through a collaborative edit
is a big part of the job.
The task of editing the submis-
sions of outsiders, such as letters to
the editor, is an added challenge.

There is no face-to-face editing in
this context, and there isn't always
time to contact the submitter to get
clarifications or corrections. While
the Daily will sometimes send an
edited piece back to the outside
writer to proofread, this practice
has pitfalls, and I always thought
best to avoid it.
As an independent editorial
voice, the Daily has the right to
properly and fairly edit all submis-
sions for clarity, veracity and space
constraints. But this task must be
given the utmost attention because
when mistakes occur, it's easy for
outsiders to criticize the paper's
processes or intentions. Should
the Daily fail on this front by mak-
ing too many mistakes, it may have
no choice but to cede to outside
submitters some of the editorial
authority it has - something that
should be avoided.
My feeling is that most problems
in the editing of stories come from
a lack of focus: It's easy for an edi-
tor to lose sight of the importance
of one piece when dealing with
numerous submissions each night.
But consider that each of those
pieces is written by an individual
who doesn't care how well you
edited all the other pieces on the
page that night. Proper editing of
submissions is part of the Daily's
mission of responsiveness to read-
ers, and it is a responsibility that
deserves attention.

SHREYA SINGH AND ETHAN HAHN |
youMICHfor our campus

A parody of itself

The Central Student Government is com-
prised of well-intentioned representatives,
but a blanket of apathy has smothered their
promises. Representatives are trapped in
a system that isn't focused on what the stu-
dents want from their government. Our goal
is to reinvigorate that system and change CSG
into a student-focused government. When we
elect our student leaders on campus to repre-
sent our interests within the University com-
munity and beyond, it's necessary that those
leaders remember the students and their
ideas. It's a fact that is easily forgotten, but
needs to become the motto of student govern-
ment. This year, we want to revert the focus
of CSG back to students, back to student life
and student organizations and back to you.
We invite you to become part of our effort -
our movement - to change the focus of stu-
dent government here on campus and to join
our party, youMICH, as we seek to make stu-
dent government all about you.
The youMICH party is led by Business
School junior Shreya Singh and LSA junior
Ethan Hahn, running for president and vice
president, respectively. During our service
as CSG treasurer and chairman of the LGBT
Issues Commission, we have invested our
time into CSG throughout our college careers
and have fought to maintain an emphasis
on the needs of the student body. Singh has
worked extensively with student organiza-
tions on campus, ensuring the transformation
of the funding process with the CSG Student
organization Funding Commission, while
Hahn has worked alongside administrators
and faculty to continually improve student
life and the campus environment, specifically
initiating the Department of Queer Studies
campaign. If elected president and vice presi-
dent of CSG, we pledge to refocus student
government's priorities on the three specific
areas that impact you the most: your student
academics, your student organizations and

your campus environment.
We have formed the youMICH party
to ensure that candidates running in this
spring's CSG elections are focused on the
constituency they serve - the wants and
needs of Michigan students. Potential you-
MICH representatives' projects will include
the following: breakfast with Brady Hoke on
the Diag, a website called Rate My Landlords
to increase dialogue between students and
realtors, continued town hall meetings and
an initiative to address police noise violations
with the Greek community. Our party's main
goals are to review and improve the Univer-
sity financial aid process, to work with the
Center for Campus Involvement to create and
maintain a University-wide student organi-
zation events calendar and to sponsor more
high-attendance events, concerts and pep
rallies for students. For more background on
our platform, check out our Facebook page at
Vote youMICH. We are proud of the projects
we've proposed and hope that others will join
the movement we've started on campus.
Though we are a new student political
party, we have experience both on and off
CSG that has given us insight regarding what
things we want to change and the practical
know-how to facilitate those changes. How-
ever, what we change will be driven by your
needs. We believe we can unite the cam-
pus as we all are composed of diverse back-
grounds, different communities, experiences
and ambitions. We invite you to come join us
in our venture for a new and improved stu-
dent body government. We want to make it
all about you, including your academics, your
student organizations and your campus envi-
ronment. We want you to be part of the move-
ment.
Shreya Singh is CSG treasurer and a Business
junior. Ethan Hahn is chairman of the LGBT
Issues Commission and an LSA junior.

don't watch much television.
Really, I don't have the time.
But the other day, having a
rare bit of down-
time, I decided
to kick back and
scan through
the channels. I
landed on CNN.A
What I saw
disgusted me.
Between talk of DANIEL
Whitney Hous- CHARDELL
ton's untimely
death and the
unrelenting bloodshed in Syria, the
screen was filled with images of
Republican presidential candidates
spewing hatred, arrogance and out-
right lies in their desperate attempt
to secure their party's nomination.
Mitt Romney's floundering cam-
paign would be sad - if he weren't
so robotic. Whether wooing Flor-
ida seniors with a stiff rendition of
"America the Beautiful" or insisting
that he is in fact a "severely con-
servative" candidate, the man can't
shed his Richie Rich image. (To be
fair, singing on the campaign trail
isn't a tactic exclusive to Republi-
cans. In January, President Obama
gave us a few lines of Al Green's
"Let's Stay Together." But hey, at
least Obama had fun with it. Rom-
ney's performance, on the other
hand, seemed more like a contrac-
tual obligation.)
And as for Rick Santorum,
he's been busy warning voters of
Obama's ostensible war on religion
as part of his broader scheme to
charm the religious right. What's my
favorite recent Santorum-ism? That
President Obama's "overt hostility
to faith in America" is leading us to
"the guillotine." Yes, he really said
this on multiple occasions.
These were the sorts of things
I was seeing on the news that day.
Just as I was wondering, "Why in

the world I was subjecting myself
to this garbage?" CNN cut to a com-
mercial break. What came on next?
An attack ad against Santorum put
out by Restore Our Future, a pro-
Romney super PAC.
I guess it was inevitable that I'd
encounter one of these ads. As of Feb.
17, Restore Our Future had bought
more than $3.2 million in media
space in Michigan, The Hufington
Post reported. In response, the Red
White and Blue Fund, a pro-Santo-
rum super PAC, is set to spend $1.1
million in airtime and TV in the
state.
All of these buys may be pumping
a bit of extra money into the Michi-
gan economy, but any potential
benefits will certainly come at the
expense of our sanity.
And then, on Saturday, I had
another unanticipated encoun-
ter with the Michigan Republican
primary. Stopped at a red light on
Hill Street, I saw Romney's cam-
paign bus drive by. It wasn't quite
as flashy as Sarah Palin's now-infa-
mous Constitution-wrapped bus in
which she toured the country last
summer, but it gets the point across.
Stenciled beneath the words "Con-
servative, Businessman, Leader"
is his campaign's stirring slogan:
"Believe in America."
I wondered how much Romney
actually believes in his "Believe in
America" catch phrase or whether
it was simply the slogan that test-
ed best in his well-funded focus
groups.
Like alot of us, I can'tstandAmer-
ican politics. It makes my blood boil.
But whatever you do, politics won't
leave you alone and it shouldn't. It
follows you wherever you go. As
Romney and Santorum descend
upon Michigan like vultures, tear
each other down in their eagerness
to secure their place in history and (I
hope) hand President Obama his sec-

end term along the way, I encourage
you to participate in politics with the
knowledge that we can only get out
of the democratic process what we
put into it.
The political process is a theatri-
cal production: it's tedious, and it's
staged drama. I know how hard it is
to stomach the absurdities of elec-
tions, and I know how easy it would
be to turn off the television when
a candidate gives us a smile as he
dances coyly around the question
he was asked, but don't let it alien-
ate you. There will be insinceri-
ties, all the more so as we approach
Super Tuesday and the general
election itself, but don't let them
drive you away.
The political
process is a
tedious and
staged drama.
Politics has become a parody of
itself. That much is obvious. But it's
a twisted irony that this thing we
call politics also has a bearing on
everything that matters - national
security, warfare, taxes, tuition
costs, economic inequality, civil
rights, healthcare and so on. To let
the Romneys and Santorums disaf-
fect you from the theatrical process
would increase the likelihood that
you'll be dissatisfied with the tan-
gible outcome of their work.
As the melodramatic political bat-
tle for Michigan begins, and as we
near next Tuesday's primary, think
about that.

and raced up the floor.
Michigan had numbers -
three maize jerseys streaking to
the hoop, with two scarlet-clad
defenders trying to protect their
basket. Novak was the slowest
of the five, but at the moment, it
didn't matter.
* He bypassed his teammates
first and then made his attack
at the rim. Between two Ohio
State defenders, the ball rolled
off of his fingers, off the glass
and through the net.
The play epitomized Novak's
four years in Ann Arbor. He was
thrust into the starting role as
a freshman. As an unathletic
guard, he was asked to battle
the Big Ten's best big men, but
he kept winning low-post bat-
tles on grit, out-hustling players
with more ability than him.
Like his coast-to-coast scor-
ing path, he took Michigan from
a program that once viewed an
NCAA Tournament berth as
its pinnacle to where it is now
- a team that looks destined to
become a perennial contender
for conference championships.
Novak picked up steam,
eventually defying the odds and
beating his faster competition
- reminiscent of the 2010-11
squad. That team was tabbed
as a Big Ten bottom feeder,
but it gained momentum at a
rapid rate down the stretch and
earned a March Madness bid
against all odds.
Before you could blink,
Michigan was ahead, 6-0. The
fans - the same ones who didn't
show up for years, scarred from
the embarrassment of the Fab
Five sanctions and the appalling
ICE SKATING
From Page 1A
it was an imitation made from a
plastic sheet coated with a layer
of glycerin. The event offered
free ice skating and skate rentals,
and was open on both Friday and
Saturday.
Winter Blast teamed up with
UMix on Friday night, a program
held various times throughout
the semester and organized by
the Center for Campus Involve-
ment, to bring more than 700
students who attended a winter
wonderland, despite the unsea-
sonably warm weather. After
students got off the ice they
enjoyed a buffet and beverage
station with hot chocolate was
available for attendees and on
Friday, Amazin' Blue, a Univer-
sity a cappella group, also gave a
musical performance.
LSA sophomore Juston Jaco,
a program assistant for the Cen-
ter for Campus Involvement, said
his team worked diligently to
organize an event for the winter
semester that would provide stu-
dents with a more exciting North
Campus atmosphere.
"Our goal was to make an
event that everyone would want
(to attend) in the winter," Jaco
said. "We were brainstorming
* and thought the ice rink would
be the best option. (We thought)
North Campus would be the
best place (to have it) because

North Campus, from a student's
perspective, doesn't get a lot of
respect."
He added that it's been diffi-
cult to increase interest in North
Campus and bring more students
to the area.

years that followed - were on
their feet, roaring.
Zack Novak slowly jogged
to the bench, exasperated, and
took a seat. With the Wolverines
ahead, 29-24, two minutes into
the second half, he picked up
his third foul and knew he'd be
on the bench for an extended
period.
In about a month, Novak will
be taking another seat - but
this time he won't be getting
back in the game. The time
remaining in his career is wan-
ing. The program that he built
practically from the ground up
will be left in the hands of his
younger apprentices.
Saturday night, knowing
there was nothing he could do
from the bench, Novak looked
on helplessly. He said he had
confidence that his teammates
could hold the lead, but the
six consecutive losses against
archrival Ohio State - games
that often painfully slipped out
of Michigan's reach in heart-
breaking fashion - must've
been playing in his head.
But Jordan Morgan, Trey
Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr.
took charge. With Novak sit-
ting, the Wolverines outscored
the Buckeyes, 8-6. It wasn't a
run that significantly widened
the margin, but it was perhaps a
sign of what will happen when
Novak leaves. His younger, more
naturally talented teammates
will take what he left them -
the groundwork and a blueprint
for success - and improve upon
it. It might be slow. Don't expect
National Championship banners
to hang in two years, but watch,
as the program will continue to
move on an upward trajectory.
Zack Novak threw his hands
in the air as the game clock

finally hit 00:00. Burke smiled.
The Victors blared. Michigan
had just upset the sixth-ranked
Buckeyes, 56-51. It was celebra-
tory, but relatively low key.
Two years ago, students
mobbed the court after Michi-
gan upset No. 15 Connecticut,
raising eyebrows around the
nation. It was telling that Wol-
verine fans found a win over a
team outside the top-10 monu-
mental.
Twice in the last three years,
with Michigan sitting on the
bubble, Crisler Arena played
host to a Selection Sunday party.
When the Wolverines earned
a bid, elated players and fans
sprung out of their chairs and
turned the hardwood into a
dance floor.
But on Saturday, fans stayed
in their seats. And come Sunday,
March 11, there will be no fes-
tivities when Michigan's name
pops up on a bracket.
"Without a doubt," Novak
said, he'd remember this as one
of the most memorable games
as a Wolverine, but he was then
quick to quell its magnitude.
"It's just another step in the
right direction."
Zack Novak's climb is com-
ing to an end, and there's no tell-
ing how many steps remain in
his career. The Wolverines are
closer to a Big Ten Champion-
ship than anyone could've pre-
dicted this year, but still, they'll
likely fall just short. Novak
probably won't cut down any
nets this year, but in the future
- the near future - Michigan
will. Its players will climb a
ladder with steps built by Zack
Novak.

"For the industry, the nation,
the economy, the future of energy
demand and supply on this earth,
we do need some clean energy
solutions," Lutz said. "Clean ener-
gy must, at some point, for long-
term success, be the most efficient
long-term solution."
In his introduction of Lutz,
Engineering Prof. Thomas Zur-
buchen said Lutz is a remarkable
figure in the automotive industry
and a "true innovator."
"He's always honest," Zur-
buchen said. "He doesn't copy
others ... (he) always has impec-
cable style. His perspective is not
always the most popular, but it's
always absolutely interesting and
exciting to me."
During his address, Lutz said
the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in
hybrid car, is the ultimate exam-
ple of a combination of innovation
and clean energy, adding that the
automobile industry is on its way
to becoming an entirely electric-
driven business in the near future.

"Electrification of the trans-
portation sector is real, it's com-
ing," Lutz said. "It is perhaps ...
going to be more gradual than
many people think."
Lutz added that he is optimistic
about the clean-energy future of
the United States, but noted that
due to recent fossil fuel discover-
ies in North America, gasoline-
powered vehicles will not be
completely replaced in the near
future.
Lutz said a future of clean
energy depends on innovative
minds like those of students at
the University.
"That future ... looks a lot
brighter to me because of the
likes of folks like you and the
work being done in this program
and others like it."
Engineering freshman Aaron
Podell said he agreed with the
topics thatLutz addressed, par-
ticularly the importance in
redirecting focus to sustainabil-
ity and environmentally friendly
initiatives.
"I think he was very accurate
in what he said - if you're going
to do something, it has to be for
a purpose, for a reason," Podell
said. "I think he showed that it's
important that we demonstrate
a need to move toward cleaner
energy, but we have to recognize
that we have years of technology
based on gas products and we
can't just abandon those."
Before the winners were
announced, the teams each gave
a three-minute presentation to
the audience of their clean ener-
gy prototype.
Wayne State University stu-
dent Yating Hu, a team mem-
ber of Piezo PowerTech, which
clinched first place and $50,000
in the showcase, said the clean
energy industry has a lot of
competition among innova-
tors because it's a relatively new
market. However, Hu said she
believes her company has a fair

chance in the business.
"We'll definitely be the solu-
tion in the future ... for this kind
of work to push the new tech-
nology on clean energy is very
important for us to get started,"
Hu said.
Hu said the Michigan Clean
Energy Venture Challenge
Prize will help her team further
advance its existing prototype by
capturing the attention of poten-
tial investors and other compa-
nies.
"Eventually, we are looking
forward to making this commer-
cialized as soon as possible and
have the jobs created in Michi-
gan as soon as possible," Hu said.
Hu added that the next step for
her team is to represent the state
of Michigan in the national com-
petition in Chicago.
In an interview after the event,
Lutz said he was impressed with
Piezo PowerTech's electric tire
gauge, which proposes to replace
battery-powered technology
with a device that would gen-
erate energy from vibrations,
rather than a source that could
otherwise produce waste.
"It makes all the sense in the
world to me," Lutz said. "If it can
store the necessary amount of
energy I think that could really
work ... that would be a tremen-
dous cost saving (technique) and
would add real value."
Though the ideas presented
in this competition are at the
beginningstages of development
and require further progress,
Lutz said he believes the designs
have a lot of potential. Specifi-
cally, he noted that small, clean-
er engines made by PicoSpray,
the second place team from the
University of Michigan, have the
potential to significantly reduce
motor emissions.
"That again would be a huge
boom in terms of saving energy
and cleaning up the air," Lutz
said.


"This gives students an oppor-
tunity to do something where
they live, because a lot of fresh-
men live in Baits I, Baits II and
Bursley," Jaco said.
After Friday's high turnout,
Winter Blast hosted an ice carv-
ing competition on the North
Campus Diag on Saturday, fea-
turing the University's Ice Carv-
ing team, as well as teams from
Henry Ford Community College
and Oakland Community Col-
lege.
Numerous University organi-
zations, including Do Random
Acts of Kindness, Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter and the Inter-Cooperative
Council, were also at Winter
Blast to show their support, and
the College of Engineering spon-
sored a pizza dinner and movie
showing.
Nate Cradit, program advi-
sor for the Center for Campus
Involvement, said he was glad
that the event brought a large
number of participants, since the
groupspent a substantial amount
of time and money planning it.
"This (ice rink idea) started
back in early fall," Cradit said.
"We launched our new office
Nov. l and part of that new office
was a push to have creative,
engaging programs that the
(University) hadn't seen before."
He continued: "For the number
of students and family members
that have been (skating), it was
totally worth it."
LSA senior Emily Samuelson,
who competed as an ice dancer
in the 2010 Winter Olympics
in Vancouver, offered skating
advice and gave a skating dem-
onstration at Winter Blast. Sam-
uelson said she enjoyed her time

at the event because she was
able to fully experience North
Campus.
"I don't spend much time on
North Campus (because) I'm
an International Studies major,
so all of my classes are back on
Central Campus," Samuelson
said. "It is really nice for me
to get out and really see what
North Campus has to offer. I like
North Campus, it's a bit calmer
than Central Campus."
LSA freshman Ryan Overhis-
er, who lives in the Baits I Resi-
dence Hall, said he decided to
attend Winter Blast on Friday to
try something new, adding that
he thought bringing the rink and
other big events to North Cam-
pus will benefit the area.
"I've never skated before, so
it was something I thought I
would try out," Overhiser said.
"I feel like North Campus is kind
of boring, so anything (Center
for Campus Involvement) can
do to get people excited or will-
ing to come out and (attend) this
kind of event is a good idea."
Engineering freshman Liam
Choi said bringing Winter
Blast and the ice rink to North
Campus helps foster a sense of
community in the area while
redirecting attention from the
already popular Central Cam-
pus.
"I think it's more about com-
munity. There are a lot of people
on Central Campus that don't
know what is on North Cam-
pus," Choi said. "I bet most
people, like freshmen from Cen-
tral Campus, have never been to
North Campus. I think (Winter
Blast) helped make students
aware of what's actually here on
North Campus."


SPLINTERS
From Page 1A
but Singh and Mersol-Barg,
who also sought the nomination
that night, have splintered from
MForward and developed their
own parties.
Singh, however, said she was
never a formal member of MFor-
ward and ran with the Michigan
Vision Party in representative
elections during her freshman
and sophomore years. She noted
that MVP is currently "dis-
solved" and that it has no active
members.
The source - who has ties to
the University's Indian commu-
nity - said Singh's candidacy
draws voters from the same pool
as Sathi.
"(Her candidacy) will defi-
nitely somewhat split the Indian
vote," the source said.
Singh and Sathi have both
been involved with the Indian
American Student Association.
In a Feb. 3 interview regarding
MForward's nominations for this
year's presidential race, Singh
praised Sathi as a qualified can-
didate.

"Aditya will be a great choice
for our presidential nominee."
She said. "I think the nomination
process was very fair ... (MFor-
ward) selected a good candidate."
Singh said her praise for Sathi
still rings true, but added that
she and her running mate, LSA
junior Ethan Hahn, chair of
CSG's LGBT Issues Commission,
believe they will clinch the presi-
dency in March.
"(Sathi is) going to be a great
competitor," she said.
Hahn said youMICH's plat-
form will focus primarily on
"academics, student organiza-
tions and the campus environ-
ment."
According to Hahn, potential
programs that will highlight
youMICH's platform include
increasing student awareness of
financial aid, overhauling Maize
Pages - a website cataloging
student organizations at the
University - and helping stu-
dents find affordable off-campus
housing through facilitating bet-
ter dialogue with realtors and
students.
Singh also announced that
youMICH will be running a full
slate of candidates for represen-

tative positions within CSG.
"(The candidates are)
extremely qualified and
extremely proactive individu-
als," she said. "They have pretty
great ideas that they want to
implement."
While Singh had yet to declare
her candidacy, she said she had
considered running for president
for a long time.
"I definitively decided (to run)
in September," she said. "But it's
always been in the back of my
mind as something that I would
like to pursue."
Singh added that her entrance
into the race will spur healthy
competition.
"I've always believed that the
more competitive a race is, the
best candidate will prevail," she
said. "I think it's going to be very
interesting to see how things
play out this year, but it's going to
be very exciting."
Singh said this year's race,
which now features three major
candidates, will make the elec-
tions more visible to the student
body.
"Maybe this will help us reach
a 20-percent turnout (in the elec-
tions)," Singh said.

Michigan wins pair after
dropping season opener

Wolverines earn revenge
against Kentucky in 2012

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
If the Michigan baseball team
proved anything this weekend,
it's that it isn't2011 anymore.
After
giving up PITTSBURGH 9
five runs MICHIGAN 8
in the final
two innings SETON HALL 1
en route to MICHIGAN 2
a season-
opening 9-8 W.VIRGINIA 3
loss to Pitts- MICHIGAN 14
burgh, the
Wolverines (2-1 overall) bounced
back to defeat Seton Hall and
West Virginia in the Big Ten/
Big East Challenge behind great
starting pitching.
"Any time you can get seven-
plus innings out of a starter,
you're in good shape to win the
game,"said sophomore rightfield-
er Michael O'Neill. "(Redshirt
junior pitcher Bobby Brosnahan
and junior pitcher Ben Ballan-
tine) didn't overthrow, they threw
strikes, they hit their spots, and
they kept us in the game."
Last season, the Wolverines
went winless at the Big Ten/Big
East Challenge and didn't pick up
their second win until 11 games
into the season while their pitch-
ing staff struggled. A much differ-
ent team appeared this weekend.
Against an undefeated Moun-
taineers team on Sunday, Michi-
gan started off strong and never
looked back. Senior third base-
man John Lorenz smacked a
three-run home run in the first
inning and five other Wolverines
collected RBI, as the offense bat-
ted in 14 runs to secure a 14-3
victory. O'Neill gave the West Vir-
ginia pitching staff fits all game,
going 3-for-5 with four runs, two

stolen-bases and one RBI.
But as well as the offense hit,
Ballantine might have had a bet-
ter game. Looking to improve on
his sophomore campaign - in
which he went 3-I with a 4.91
earned run average - Ballantine
pitched seven strong innings,
while allowing just three hits and
one earnedrun. He also had five
strikeouts.
"We definitely wanted to come
back to Ann Arbor with a win-
ning record because we knew
how important it would be for
our morale," Ballantine said.
"(Assistant coach Steve) Merri-
man and I, we just said, 'attack
the hitters with fastballs ... keep
them off balance with some off-
speed stuff and let the defense
make plays.'
"And they did that all game,
and so it was really easy for me
to make it through seven innings
today."
Ballantine's performance gave
the Wolverines their second-
straight game with a strong pitch-
ingperformance.
The difference on Saturday,
though, was that Michigan really
needed Brosnahan's strong show-
ing.
With the Wolverines's lineup
struggling to produce, Brosna-
han sqaured off against Seton
Hall's Rick Mangione in a pitch-
er's duel. After giving up a run in
the first inning, Brosnahan sty-
mied the Pirates's lineup for the
rest of the game. He allowed just
three hits, while striking out four
batters over the next six innings.
Meanwhile, Michigan's bats
came alive in the bottom of the
sixth inning. Junior center field-
er Patrick Biondi started off the
inning with a single. After Bion-
di stole second base, freshman

left fielder Will Drake doubled
down the right field line to tie
the score at one. Seton Hall then
brought in Benny Mejia to relieve
Mangione, but the Wolverines
were still able to capitalize on
the scoring opportunity. After
Drake advanced to third base on
an O'Neill fly to right field, senior
catcher Coley Crank knocked
him in on a sacrifice fly to left
field to give the Wolverines the
lead for good.
Redshirt sophomore Logan
McAnallen came on in relief to
pitch a scoreless final two innings
to secure the win for Brosnahan.
"I was encouraged by the
pitching," said Michigan coach
Rich Maloney. "I thought Bobby
and Logan pitched very well."
The opening weekend also
revealed that the Wolverines have
found an offensive force in Drake.
In his first collegiate game,
the first-year player went 3-for-5
with two runs scored and one RBI
against the Panthers. He finished
the weekend with five hits, five
runs, four RBI and three stolen
bases.
"He drives in runs, he's con-
stantly on base, he can steal
whenever he wants - it's nice
to hit behind him because he's
always on base," O'Neillsaid. "Not
only does he drive in runs, but he
also allows (other) hitters to drive
him in. He's an instant impact on
offensive."
After going winless at the Big
Ten/Big East Challenge last year,
Michigan is encouraged by it's
two early wins, especially by the
way itplayed after the dishearten-
ing loss to Pittsburgh.
"We battled back," O'Neill.
"We didn't let that loss on Friday
night determine our weekend
which is a great sign."

Many questioned whether
the Wolverines could handle the
stronger teams from the south
and west, and this weekend
was a chance to prove that they
could.
Freshman pitcher Haley
Wagner led the way for the Wol-
verines, improving her record to
4-0. The standout rookie threw
her second and third complete
games and held No. 22 Kentucky
scoreless.
"I just pitch and let my
defense work," Wagner said. "I
trust them tobe there for me and
I know that they have my back."
Wagner didn't seem fazed
heading into the matchup
against Kentucky. Despite see-
ing her defense struggle early
in the weekend, the youngster
didn't feel pressure - or at least
you couldn't tell.

Senior third baseman Amanda Chidester and Michigan went 4-1 in Florida.

"I went into it just like it was

"It's just a game where I'm going

Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins was quick to credit her
young pitcher.
"I thought Haley had an out-

"She worked the count well and
the defense stepped up behind
her."

back from a tough loss to Mary-
land early in the tournament.
Michigan never found its
groove in that match, commit-
ting six errors that allowed the
opposition to get into scoring
position.
Freshman pitcher Sarah
Driesenga took the loss on the
mound against the Terrapins,
but Hutchins said the loss was
the result of the entire team's
poor play.
"I thought everything went
wrong," Hutchins said. "We
couldn't hit, our pitching had a
rough day, and our fielding was
horrendous."
"It was just one of those
games where nothing goes your
way," added senior third base-
man Amanda Chidester.
"We definitely have a lot of
work, as every team does, but
it has to be up to us to play for
Michigan and fight hard for our
team."
A loss now is better than late
in the season for the Wolver-
ines, when momentum is crucial
to putting together a run in the
postseason.
Hutchins was happy with the
team's response to the loss Fri-
day, though.
"I thought we owned it, took
ownership of it, and then put it
behind us," Hutchins said.
"I thought
we owned it "
(and) put it
behind us."
After losing to Maryland on
Friday, Michigan strung togeth-
er four shutouts against Long
Island, Kentucky, Florida Atlan-
tic and Wright State.
Despite the lack of power hit-
ting, the Wolverines handled
each team with ease. Michigan
tallied only one home run and
one double in the five games. In
last weekend's tournament, the
Wolverines hit four home runs
in four games.
But home runs aren't neces-
sary when you post four straight
shutouts.
"I am not really big on the
shutout, but it is a great way to
beat someone," Hutchins said.
"Shutouts are a team effort. We
have a versatile pitching staff
this year. They are each focused
on pitching one inning at a time
right now."
Chidester said that piecing
together wins like the team has
been is simple, as long as Michi-
gan keeps it simple.
"You play your position and
you do your part at your posi-
tion," Chidester said. "When you
try to do more, mistakes hap-
pen."

Slapstick still relevant

T he Colbert Report."
Uncyclopedia. Col-
legeHumor. Both late-
night television and the Internet
are filled to the brim with the
sweet sounds
of satire, cari-
cature and
parody. The
business of
comedy in the
up-and-com-
ing age of new
media seems LAUREN
set on cou- CASERTA
pling laughter
with social
commentary
- and son, business is booming.
But does their rise herald
an end to a simpler comedic
era? Are the antiquated antics
of physical humor obsolete? A
slapstick routine from the Three
Stooges may have cut it with our
parents, but is it still enough to
entertain the socially savvy chil-
dren of Generation Z?
Superficially, things look grim.
Nowadays, the word "slapstick"
tends to invoke a mental image
of the latest B-movie disaster.
Physical comedy is traditionally
easier and cheaper to film than
a fantasy epic or crime thriller,
though extravagant amounts
of money and effort are by no
means a guarantee of quality
(I'm looking at you, "Avatar: The
. Last Airbender").
But even though physical com-
edy seems to attract more atten-
tion when it's done poorly than
when it's done correctly, a true
fan knows that slapstick is by no
means headed for the Graveyard
of Genres Past. There's some-
thing about seeing another per-
son land on their ass at exactly
the right moment that triggers
an instinctive chuckle from even
the most serious satirist.
So do audiences of the 21st
century still enjoy watching
slapstick? Ask the cast members
of the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance's "Noises Off," who,
as of this moment, are tearing
down their lovely two-story set
and reminiscing about what was
probably a kickass cast party. A

Sloppy bro-antics
misfire in War'

Witherspoon and
company can't pull
this film together
By ARIELLE ACKERMAN
For the Daily
"This Means War" is a feeble
stab at a rom-corm, intended for
couples still riding that Val-
entine's Day
high. While it's **
not a complete
trainwreck of This Means
a movie like War
some of Reese
Witherspoon's At Quality16
past romantic and Rave
comedies, it
tries way too 20th Century Fox
hard to be a
film that boyfriends won't mind
being dragged to. McG ("Char-
lie's Angels") delivers another
underwhelming, action-packed
flick - this time with a bit of
romance mixed in.
Chris Pine ("Star Trek") and
Tom Hardy ("Inception") play
two hardly covert but highly
stylized CIA agents named FDR
and Tuck, respectively. After
they both fall for Lauren, an
uptight product tester played
by Reese Witherspoon ("Walk
the Line"), these best friends
make a gentleman's agreement
to respect the other's attempts
at winning the girl. The "gentle-
man" part soon falls to the way-

side, as they employ tranquilizer
guns and prop rain to one-up
each other on their dates with
Lauren.
Oh, and there's some other
storyline that involves a bad
guy out to avenge his brother's
death at the hands of FDR and
Tuck, but it's never really more
than a distraction. Til Schweiger
("Inglourious Basterds") plays
the villain, a guy with a German
surname, an unplaceable Euro-
pean accent and stereotypically
Russian henchmen. Just what
exactly does this guy do? The
most the movie ever gives us on
him is that he's mean and just a
little trigger-happy. His story
is skimmed over pretty quickly,
but every so often he pops in
and stirs up some trouble so
that McG can include some of
his typical, over-the-top action
sequences in the film.
Both storylines are seriously
underdeveloped, making this
a lackluster and unsatisfying
movie. But it does have some
highlights, particularly the bro-
mance between FDR and Tuck.
Most of the humorous scenes
sprinkled throughout the movie
show them throwing quips back
and forth and pulling CIA-level
pranks on each other.
In fact, Pine and Hardy have
more chemistry with each other
than either has with Wither-
spoon.
Unlike her male counterparts,
Lauren would be an easily for-

gettable character if she didn't
keep appearing to tell her friend
Trish (Chelsea Handler, TV's
"Chelsea Lately") how stressed
she is from dating the two hand-
some leading men. Handler, who
essentially plays herself (but
with a kid and a Cheeto-loving
husband), is more memorable
than the usually captivating
Witherspoon in this one-dimen-
sional performance.
Everything in this movie
moves just a little too quickly.
Timothy Dowling ("Just Go with
It") and Simon Kinberg ("Mr.
& Mrs. Smith"), who wrote the
screenplay, made it so rushed
that by the end, it's not really
even understandable why Lau-
ren chooses one of these men at
all.
After all, they basically stalk
her for the entire movie and then
adjust themselves to be more
like what Lauren wants so they
can get her into bed. And despite
dialogue that namedrops Gloria
Steinem, both female leads heav-
ily define themselves through
the men in their lives.
For a movie that's made purely
for entertainment (and certainly
not for its realism or substance),
"This Means War" barely pass-
es. It has its moments, but it's
probably best saved for a night
when you're bored at home and
looking for some mindless enter-
tainment that's just a cut above
"Keeping Up with the Kardashi-
ans."

FILM REVIEW
'Arrietty' has big heart

Nicolas Cage, dim

By AKSHAY SETH
DailyArts Writer
There's no doubting that Nico-
las Cage really is bat-shit crazy.

tiles for fun and Ghost Rider:

look the fact that somehow, this
man hasan Oscar.
Cage can act. And that surpris-
ing truth has further befuddled
the confused people who find
themselves watching the dreck
he's been in during the past few
years. "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Ven-
geance," is no exception to this
trend. It's an overblown super-
hero adaptation with a few gothic
touches brushed on to add a half-
assed semblance of "uniqueness."
Needless to say, the gimmick
doesn't work.
The script picks up eight
years after the conclusion of the
first "Ghost Rider" and follows
Johnny Blaze, played by Cage,
as he struggles to deal with the
satanic curse that gives him his
superpowers. After the events of
the previous film, Blaze is in hid-
ing somewhere within Eastern
Europe, until he's approached
by a French monk (Idris Elba,
"Thor").
After subjecting us to a few
of the patently shitty one-liners

ing and protecting a young child
that the Devil (Ciarin Hinds,
"The Woman in Black") is trying
to turn into the Antichrist. If the
Ghost Rider is able to return the
child in safe condition, his curse
will be lifted. Also along for the
ride is Nadya (Violante Placido,
"The American"), the kid's moth-
er: "the Devil's baby mama," in
Cage's eloquent wording.
Neveldine/Taylor ("Crank"),
the directorial team behind this
waste of a movie ticket, is known
for an uncanny ability to cre-
ate glossy CGI on a budget. And
that's likely the only reason they
were hired. Tobe fair, some of the
action sequences in this film real-
ly are worth watching. The large-
scale fight scenes between the
Ghost Rider and the Devil's min-
ions are fun to watch and prob-
ably couldn't have been recreated
in all their glory by another team
of directors.
Sadly, that's only going to be
enough for the audience mem-
bers who care about nothing
other than how cool the action is.
But in the average movie-goer's

mind, when there's absolutely no
weight behind any of the charac-
ters and the script feels unneces-
sarily beaten down and forced,
it's difficult to remain engaged,
regardless of the action.
Needless to say, the silly script
doesn't help the performances,
none of which are noteworthy,
except for how bad they are. Cage,
with his typically overblown take
on character analysis, finds a way
to make us chuckle every now
and then - but it's always clear
that we're laughing at him, not
with him.
When all's said and done,
"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Ven-
geance," ends up falling in line
with the other horrible superhe-
ro adaptations that have come out
this year. The script falls prey to
overused mechanics and a whole
lot of money is wasted trying to
make up for it through intricate-
ly composed action sequences.
Cage, with all his financial issues,
has reason enough totake part in
the nonsense. To the rest of the
people involved - what the hell
were you thinking?

The titular Arrietty Clock

a Borrower - a dying race of min-

life, hiding from crows, cats and
most of all, humans. One night,
when Arrietty and her father Pod

discovered by the house's newest
human resident, Shawn (David

His mother would have spent

Wolverines sweep
Wildcats with OT
senior-night win

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
It was a battle of wills, a game
between two rivals, with noth-
ing but pure heart deciding the
outcome.
It was a contest to see if Mich-
igan was tough enough to take
the next step, to truly contend for
a Big Ten title.
It was a physical clash, with
Ohio State - the king of the con-
ference - and its star big man
Jared Sullinger determined to
wear down the Wolverines,
determined to make them buckle
on a home floor they've protect-
ed all season long.
Through it all, Jordan Morgan
stood tall.
"We said before the game, 'It's
going to be ugly,' " the redshirt
sophomore forward said. "(We
wanted to) make it ugly. We
wanted to bring the hammer."
At 6-foot-8 and a chiseled
250 pounds, Morgan is, without
question, the biggest and stron-
gest member of the No.17 Michi-
gan men's basketball team. That
means he's also the player that
Michigan coach John Beilein
must depend on to bring physi-
cality to the court every single
game - Beilein doesn't have any-
one else, especially with injured
sophomore forward Jon Horford

relegated to the bench.
And Morgan was especially
needed against No. 6 Ohio State.
Most Big Ten matchups are
physical affairs, but it was evi-
dent early on Saturday night that
the game would be especially
rough-and-tumble.
But it also became clear early
on that the Wolverines, so often
criticized for being weak in the
paint and on the boards, were
ready to bring the fight to the
bigger, longer and more ath-
letic Buckeyes. Morgan led the
charge.

"That's the

On Friday night, the No. 5

its freshmen from the get-go to
carry the scoring load. Forward

time since NMU 1

forward NMU 2
Alex Gup- MICHIGAN 3
till gave the
Wolverines the lead for good later
on in the first period.
Those two goals would be the
difference for Michigan in a 4-1
victory over Northern Michigan.
But on Saturday, the upper-
classmen played like they had
something to prove to the crowd
on senior night at Yost Ice Arena.
The game had a different vibe to
it.
Michigan and Northern Mich-
igan (11-6-3 CCHA, 14-12-6 over-
all) needed an overtime period
to settle the last regular-season
game at Yost, trading punches for
the first 60 minutes to a 2-2 dead-
lock.
Junior forward A.J. Treais
made quick work of the extra

time. He needed just 1:20 of over-
time to score on a wrister to the
left side of the net, tying Guptill
for the team lead with 15 goals.
Michigan is 9-2-1 in 2012, and
Saturday's win guaranteed it a
bye in the first round the CCHA
Tournament.
Treais has seven goals in as
many games, but the biggest one
of that stretch sent Michigan (14-
8-4,20-10-4) home with a 3-2 vic-
tory.
"It's pretty fitting," said senior
captain Luke Glendening. "The
way he's been playing has been
unbelievable."
But Michigan doesn't come
close to winning that game with-
out its seniors.
Senior defenseman Greg
Pateryn was on a mission, deliv-
ering bone-jarring hits every
chance he got. There were a
handful of instances on Saturday
where Pateryn and a Wildcat had
an open-ice collision. Pateryn
won every time.
"I saw my opportunities and I
tried to step up," Pateryn said. "If
I can get a few big hits like that,
it kind of gets everyone going as
well. That's kind of what I was
See WILDCATS, Page 3B

The Detroit native served
notice in the game's opening
possession. Ohio State immedi-
ately dumped the ball down low
to Sullinger, a Big Ten Player of
the Year candidate at forward.
Sullinger has had his way with
Michigan in the past, but this
time, Morgan was ready, holding

tough in that initial matchup and
forcing a missed shot.
That was the story most of
the night. Sullinger had his most
ineffective performance against
Michigan to date, converting on
just six of 14 field-goal attempts.
And much of the time, it was
Morgan and Morgan alone

defending the Buckeye, work-
ing feverishly to deny him the
ball and holding his ground
when Sullinger tried to back him
down. The Wolverines doubled
him and gave help on a few occa-
sions, especially in the second
half. But Beilein said he was

A GameDay to remember, on and off the court

February 18 is a day you'll
remember.
There wasn't a singular
moment - an announcement,
a shot or an overtime winner -
that defined Saturday, though
each played a role in the day.
But at some point, a chilly day
in Ann Arbor took a turn for the
legendary.
It was a 24-hour-long rage bri-
gade, a fury of Michigan fervor.
The day
started early.
A handful

midnight. NESBITT
They were
responding to
a challenge by ESPN GameDay
analyst Rece Davis:
"I think the one thing that
Michigan can do in the morning
is show itself to be a football and
basketball school," Davis said on
Friday.
Camped outside the arena, the
Maize Rage made an early state-
ment. Within hours, Michigan
proved the rest in an emphatic
manner: Michigan is a football,
basketball and hockey school.
For a quick summation,
Michigansjchmoozed with ESPN
GameDay all day in a packed
Crisler Center, toppled No. 6
Ohio State on the hardwood,
swept Northern Michigan at
Yost Ice Arena, then picked up
six four-star football recruits on

field (5).
Six four-star commitments in
a day. Series sweep. Beat Ohio
(past tense).
Michigan hockey never left.
But the football and basketball
programs are different stories.
Hoke and Co. brought Michi-
gan back with one season - a
10-2 record punctuated by a
Sugar Bowl squeaker. Michigan
basketball coach John Beilein
brought NCAA Tournament
expectations back to Crisler.
"The best part is both pro-
grams (basketball and football)
are back to where they're sup-
posed to be," said senior guard
Zack Novak on Saturday.
For the seniors, the ones who
knew nothing but heartbreak
on the hardwood and disaster
at the Big House, this is the
just reward. The basketball and
football teams are now unblem-
ished at home - a combined
23-0 home record in the 2011-12
seasons.
You can't ask for more than
that.
Saturday finally came to a
close. But it wasn't forgotten.
I got a text from a colleague
at 1:34 a.m. I was recuperating,
watching an episode of "How I
Met Your Mother." He was just
packing up at Crisler Center.
His Saturday started with

Members of the Maize Rage showed up the night before the GameDay set went live to guarentee a spot in attendance on Michigan's historic Saturday.

the side.
What did you do with your
Saturday?
When the gates at Crisler
opened at 9:00 a.m., the Maize
Rage and hundreds of others
filed in. ESPN showed a clip of
Denard Robinson heading into
the bowels of the arena to give
the GameDay crew a pep talk.
One shirtless fan stood up to
show off his sign:
Kate Upton hates Ohio.
Others joined in.
OSU has Casey Anthony, UM
has Kate Upton. You decide.
Jeremy Lin hates the Buckeyes.
I (heart) Denard.
Clearly pop culture wasn't

lost on Michigan, and ESPN cap-
tured it all. The Wolverines' bas-
ketball program was on the main
stage for the first time since the
'Fab Five' in the early 1990s.
Meanwhile, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke and the football staff
- just three weeks after final-
izing the 2012 recruiting class
- were collecting stars like they
were playing Super Mario.
The four-star names rifled out
by the hour:
12:15p.m.: offensive lineman
Jake Butt. 12:50 p.m.: running
back Wyatt Shallman. 2:45 p.m.:
cornerback Jourdan Lewis. 2:45
p.m.: lineman David Dawson.
A few hours later at Yost,

junior forward A.J. Treais took a
feed from captain Luke Glenden-
ing and buried his shot to give
the Michigan hockey team an
overtime victory on senior night
and a series sweep over North-
ern Michigan. The win kept the
Wolverines in the hunt for their
second consecutive CCHA title.
A few blocks away and a few
more hours later at Crisler Cen-
ter, freshman guard Trey Burke
led the Wolverines to a 56-51 vic-
tory over the Buckeyes.
It was the basketball pro-
gram's first victory over Ohio
State in seven tries, dating back
to Jan. 3, 2010. And this one was
in front of a packed house and a

nationwide TV audience.

Blue falls to No. 1 Utah Michigan tops Ohio State

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
Chances to upend a top-ranked
team don't come around often.
On Friday night, the No. 21
Michigan women's gymnastics
team let that opportunity slip
right throughtheir hands.
"We can't afford to let oppor-
tunities like this to keep passing
us by," said Michigan head coach
Bev Plocki.
After a strong start to the meet,
the Wolverines just couldn't hold
on down the stretch. Utah (5-1),
who came into Ann Arbor ranked
first in the nation, proved too
strong in their final two rotations
and took the contest, 196.050-
194.850.
The night looked promising
from the start, as Michigan (6-2)
continued it's season-long profi-
ciency on vault. Junior Brittnee
Martinez and sophomore Stepha-
nie Colbert started the event for

Wolverines with decent scores,
but it was the impressive perfor-
mance of juniorKatie Zurales that
energized the team. Sophomore
Joanna Sampson followed with
an electrifying vault of her own,
only to be topped by freshman
Sachi Sugiyama's event-best 9.900
at the tail end of the lineup. Not
only was Michigan's vault perfor-
mance their third-best of the sea-
son, but the team also continued
its streak of scoring above 49.000
on the event in every meet this
season.As the two teams swapped
events, the Wolverines held a
slight lead going into their second
rotation on bars. A pair of 9.700
scores from the duo of Sugiyama
and freshman Annette Miele led
the way for Michigan. The Wol-
verines finished the event strong,
as the trio of Sampson, Zurales,
and Martinez all scored 9.775.
The Utes held a narrow lead at the
halfway point, 98.050-97.825.
"We came out of vault really

confident, ready to hit bars, and
we didn't get exactly the scores
we wanted to on bars, but we were
still on a high," said sophomore
Shelby Gies.
Michigan looked to regain the
lead heading into the third rota-
tion, but knew it would need a stel-
lar performance on beam. Gies,
who competed in three events
for the first time in her collegiate
career, gave the Wolverines hope
with a 9.800 to start. Zurales'
9.850 tied for the event title, but it
wouldn't be enough, as Michigan
struggled towards the end of its
lineup. After the final two Wol-
verines fell and recorded 9.200,
the team was forced to count one
of the falls in their overall score.
With little hope of toppling
Utah remaining, Michigan would
need more of its previous magic
on the floor. Miele, who has
continued to improve her score
throughout the last three meets,
scored a season-high 9.800 early
in the lineup. Sampson attempted
to give the Wolverines a spark
with her own season-best, 9.925,
but it wouldn't be enough to make
up for the low scores of her other
teammates.
"We've been working on keep-
ing the energy high even if we
don't get the scores we wanted, or
it works out the way we wanted
to," Sampson said.
Sampson would go on to win
the meet's all-around perfor-
mance. Nonetheless, the con-
sistency of the Utes was simply
too much for the Wolverines to
handle.

After losing to Ohio State -
the first time in four years - the
Windy City Invitational on Jan.
14, the No.7 Michiganmen'sgym-
nastics team got its revenge.
Fueled by sophomore Sam
Mikulak claiming five of the six
events, the Wolverines posted a
score of 345.700 to the Buckeyes'
334.200. The Wolverines also
handily beat the SUNY Brockport
Golden Eagles - a club team -
which tallied 275.700.
The Wolverines (6-4 overall,
2-1 Big Ten) entered the matchup
with high hopes. They hadn't
competed as a team since Janu-
ary and were ridingthe success of
freshman Adrian de los Angeles,
freshman Stacey Ervin and Miku-
lak at the Winter Cup.
"I expected to win," said Mich-
igan coach Kevin Golder. "But we
knew Ohio State is a pretty good
team. We beat them by a pretty
good margin, but I was more
focused on our team tonight. Any
time we can beat Ohio State is
great."
Ohio State (5-2 overall, 4-1 Big
Ten) entered the season ranked
nationally as the No. 2 team and
was undefeated in conference
play before the weekend.
Michigan started off strong in
the first rotation on floor. Miku-
lak placed first with a 14.90, and
junior Rohan Sebastian placed
third with a 14.50. Suffering from

Duo leads Blue to
convincing win

Senior guard Courtney Boylan posted 14 points and five assists against Indiana on Sunday.
Michigan hounds Hoosiers

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
BLOOMINGTON - Every
home game, the crowd at Assem-
bly Hall stands until Indiana
scores its _
first basket MICHIGAN 61
following INDIANA 48
the tipoff.
When the Michigan women's
basketball team traveled to
Bloomington on Sunday after-
noon, the crowd stood for the
first two minutes of the game.
The Wolverines took a 6-2 lead
during that stretch, never relin-
quishing it, and went on to defeat
Indiana 61-48.
Duringthe first half, Michigan
looked like the team that easily
handled Indiana in Ann Arbor on
Jan. 22. Senior guard Courtney
Boylan tallied 11 first-half points,
and junior forward Rachel Shef-
fer finished the period with eight
rebounds and eight points.
But at other times, the Wolver-
ines looked like the same team
that blew a 13-point lead against
Iowa at home last Thursday.
Michigan uncharacteristically
turned the ball over nine times
duringthe first frame - some on
consecutive possessions - and
looked flustered against Indi-
ana's defense.
The Wolverines' nine turn-
overs in the first half matched
their entire game total the last

trying to do."
Added Michigan coach Red
Berenson: "Game in and game
out, he plays like a man."
Senior goaltender Shawn
Hunwick continued his stel-
lar season in net, posting
26 saves on both Friday and
Saturday, bailing out a Wol-
verine defense that played a
less-than-spectacular game.
Hunwick allowed just two
goals, and even then, a bad
defensive turnover left him
out to dry on the Wildcats' first
tally of the night.
And though Treais was the
hero, the game was won by the
captain. On that game-win-
ningshot, Luke Glendening got
the puck on the opposite side of
Treais and sent off an absolute

content to let Morgan handle him
alone most of the time.
"That's the Jordan Morgan
we've seen flashes of, and (that)
we're starting to see more and
more," said senior guard Zack
Novak. "He played like a man
tonight.
"Everyone talks about Sull-
inger, (and) he's avery, verygood
player. ButI think Jordan was up
to the challenge tonight."
On the offensive end, Morgan
was efficient, making five of his
eight field-goal attempts.
Morgan might not ever be the
type of player that can consis-
tently score with his back to the
basket in the paint, but he contin-
ues to grow as a fast-break run-

ning mate and an opportunistic
finisher off misses.
In the tense second half, Mor-
gan forced the raucous Crisler
Center crowd to its feet with a
pair of emphatic, one-handed
fast-break slams. The first came
when two minutes had elapsed
after the break, and the second
followed a minute later. Both
came after Ohio State baskets,

time the two teams squared off.
But Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth attempted to rally his
troops in the locker room during
halftime, and whatever he said
seemed to work.
The Wolverines went on a 9-0
run during the first four min-
utes of the second half, giving
them a game-high 15-point lead.
The Hoosiers had scored just six
points by the 12-minute mark,
mostly due to an increase in the
defensive pressure by Michigan.
But Indiana coach Felisha
I Legette-Jack attributed Michi-
gan's second-half flurry to some-
thing different.
"(In the second half,) we
decided to come out with some
quick hits that were wide open,
and just mistimed the pass... lit-
tle things like that," Legette-Jack
said. "We had a game plan and
nobody could score within the
first few minutes of the second
half."
Boylan and Sheffer's one-two-
punch was too much for the Hoo-
siers to handle, especially in the
second half. Sheffer tallied her
second career double-double on
Sunday, finishing with 18 points
and 13 rebounds. Boylan added 14
points and five assists without a
turnover. But Boylan only played
27 minutes - eight minutes less
than her season average. Fresh-
man guard Brenae Harris gave
Boylan a nice breather during
rocket clear across the ice that
Treais redirected perfectly.
"It's really special," Pateryn
said. "Right when Luke had
that puck and I saw A.J. wide
open, I knew Luke was going
to pass it for some reason. ... I
was a little premature in my
celebration."
That assist was preceded
by the first goal of the game,
where Glendening showed offI
his powerful stick again with a
snipe from the slot. This is the
smallest senior class Berenson
could remember - only four
Wolverines were honored after
Saturday's game. For compari-
son's sake, there are eight fresh-
man on the roster this year.
This is also a senior class that a
wasn't supposed to be this suc-
cessful. Pateryn was a healthy h
scratch at points during his tI
sophomore year. Glendening e
and Hunwick were both walk- w
on, non-scholarship players that h
and both gave the momentum
back to Michigan.
Morgan's and-one with 7:25
left in the game pushed the Wol-
verine lead back out to seven
points, and it was also huge in
keeping the Buckeyes from put-
ting together a run.
But for all his offensive and
defensive prowess, the most sig-
nificant aspect of Morgan's night
was his abilityto stay on the court.
He's had fewer struggles with
fouling this season compared to
last year, but it's still emerged at
times - he had to sit for much
of the second half in Michigan's
64-49 loss to Ohio State on Jan.
29, for example.
When he picked up two quick
fouls just two minutes into the
second half, it appeared Morgan
was headed for foul trouble again.
Senior guard Stu Douglass noted

that, whereas Morgan would
"sulk" and have a "woe-is-me"
attitude in the post, he refocused,
kept his composure and played
through it this time.
Morgan didn't collect another
foul the rest of the game, and even
had the confidence to step into the
lane and draw a key charge with
just over four minutes left in the
game.

both halves. She made the most
of her 13 minutes, scoring four
points on 2-for-3 shooting.
The usually reliable Michi-
gan bench was quiet on Sunday,
tallying only ten points. Part of
that was due to the offensive suc-
cess that Sheffer, Boylan and the
other starters had.
Though the Wolverine bench
struggled, almost every Hoo-
sier player struggled. With 9:20
left in the game, Indiana junior
Aulani Sinclair knocked down
two-straight 3-pointers and cut
the Wolverine lead to ten points.
Sinclair finished the game with
17 points and was the only Hoo-
sier player to score in double dig-
its.
Throughout the entire game,
the Hoosiers didn't look like a
team that's winless in the Big
Ten. Indiana out-rebounded the
Wolverines by six and cut Michi-
gan's 16-point lead to nine at one
point. The Wolverines hadn't
won at Assembly Hall in nine
years, and even though Indiana
is weaker than usual this season,
any road win is important.
"Every game is so big in the
Big Ten," Boylan said. "You look
at (Indiana) and you are like,
'How are they 0-13?' Look at the
athletes they have. They have a
(6-foot-6 center) who can shoot
3's. It's only a matter of time
before they start winning games
and get back on track."

BLOOMINGTON - It wa
the same story on the board
on Sunday, but it turned out
bit different for the Michiga
women's basketball team.
The Wolverines hav
often had trouble clearin
the glass this season, bein
outrebounded in 18 of its 2
games. But this weekenc
junior center Rachel She
fer had a career-high da
rebounding, and she effec

players. Sheffer recorde
her second career double
double with 18 points and 1
rebounds. She was well o
her way to a game-high pe
formance at the end of th
first half, when she had eigh
points and eight rebounds.
But most of her damag
was done in the second hal
Sheffer came out of the lock

quick layup and grabbing tw
quick rebounds to help Mich

a 9-0 run.
Sheffer was up again:

6-foot-6 Quaneisha McCurt
and 6-foot-4 Sasha Chap
lin. She was able to put up
majority of the Wolverine
points in the paint and hol
the duo to just five points.
Michigan coach Kevi
Borseth noted how Indian
plays a tough, physical gam

"Rachel - obviously he

them."
Though Sheffer con-
trolled much of the sec-
is ond-half offense for the
s Wolverines, senior guard
a Courtney Boylan was in con-
n trol of the game during the
first stanza.
e Boylan broke into double
g digits with 7:36 to go in the
:g first half and led all scorers
7 with 11 points at the end of
d, the half.
f- Though she's been rela-
:y tively quiet of late, Boylan
c- broke back into her normal
st role, running the offense and
d taking her open looks.
- She settled down in the
.3 second half, finishing with 14
n points on 4-of-9 shooting and
r- knocking down 50 percent of
e her 3-point attempts. One of
it the reasons why Boylan was
so efficient was that she han-
e ded the ball cleanly - she
f. didn't have a single turnover
k- while dishing out five assists,
a many to Sheffer in the paint.
o Though Boylan was a
- factor on offense, she saw
n less floor time than normal,
playing for only 27 minutes.
st Freshman guard Brenae
t: Harris relieved Boylan for
y the time she was out. Borseth
- went to Harris because of the
a physical toll that extended
s' minutes over the course of
d the season will do to a player.
"Sometimes you grind
n (Boylan) so much," Borseth
a said. "I know in Nebraska
e she was begging to come
is out. After a while it wears
:g on you, so I think we have to
be a little smarter with time
r management. ... Forty min-
- utes in this league, it's really
mi demanding on the body as
.d well as the mind."
n Regardless of their
rt exhaustion, Boylan and Shef-
g fer played through the physi-
). cal game and came out on
t- top, lifting Michigan to its
.d first win at Assembly Hall in
d nine years.
Berenson said. "It's night and
day. These guys are as good as
it gets."
This class isn't the most tal-
ented Michigan has ever seen,
but it's a class that embodies the
type of player Berenson fills his
program with: tough, scrappy
and determined.
"I know they are dialed-in
every night, but this has to be a
special night," Berenson said.
"Is it a coincidence that Luke
Glendening gets a goal and an
assist tonight on senior night? I
don't think so."
On Saturday, Pateryn was
one-on-one with a Wildcat,
who made a quick move to the
goal. Pateryn sprawled on the
ice, knocking the puck free and
clearing the threat.
It was a trademark play of this
senior class - they don't appear
on the stat sheet and they don't
get much glory.
But they win games.

itself up 54-49 with under

two free throws to cut the
lead to three, and the Buck-

I eyes needed a stop to have a
chance to tie.
Burke didn't give it to
them.
"I was waiting to call that
timeout, and I just saw some
space there," Beilein said.
- "And we just decided to go
i with it, thinking that ... we
know what to do up three
with ten seconds to go, nine
seconds to go."
Burke took Craft off the
dribble, went to his right, put
it high off the glass and gave
Michigan its first victory in
seven tries against the Buck-
1 eyes.
"I just told the team that
- we were not going to lose this
I game," Burke said. "We're
undefeated at home, we knew
we had to protect the house.
The whole team was down
with it that we weren't going
to lose this game."
They didn't, and John
Beilein can finally go to sleep.

"Craft is such a tricky
defender," Burke said. "I
kind of looked him off with
my eyes, and just gunned it
in there. I knew Jordan was
going to run for me. After the
first dunk he got, I knew he
was going to continue to run
for me and I was going to be
able to get him the ball."
Morgan finished with 11
points and 11 rebounds to give
him his first-career double-
double - against one of the
top big men in the country, no
less.
Thomas did all he could
to keep the Buckyes within
striking distance. He put
up eight points and seven
rebounds in the first half, and
then scored the first ten Ohio
State points in the second.
Thomas had already recorded
a double-double just minutes
into the second half and fin-
ished with 25 points and 13

The back-and-forth, holy-crap-

reminiscent of the runway scene

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Fifth-year senior goalie Shawn Hunwick has grown into a Hobey Baker contender in his second season as starter.

history of Michigan hockey, began
garnering serious national atten-
tion. And the questions soon fol-
lowed.
Can a goalie win the Hobey
Baker Award? It hasn't been done
since 2001, when Michigan State's
Ryan Miller won.
Is Hunwick the long-awaited,
public-school version of Rudy in
college hockey?
If Hunwick skates behind the
net to collect and distribute the
puck, can he see over the cross-
bar?
Okay, so maybe nobody was
really asking the last one. But
Hunwick was beginning to make
a legitimate case for the trophy
given to college hockey's most
excellent player.
So why am I writing this col-
umn now, besides the fact that I'm
quickly running out of weekends?
This weekend, Hunwick was
his usual self: solid, if not stel-
lar; Impressive, if not incredible.

There's simply no other player
in the nation that so consistently
gives his team a chance to win.
Sure, you could say that's
because he's the goalie - as Hun-
wick goes, so does Michigan. But
the team completely rallies around
its leader. No player in the country
has as much ability to inspire the
team with his play than Hunwick.
It's much easier to give the extra
effort when he is willing to stand
on his head every night.
And that's exactly what hap-
pened when Hunwick made a
rare mistake in Saturday night's
win over Northern Michigan. The
out-wide shot that Hunwick casu-
ally gloves dozens of times over
got through and grazed the side
netting. But that equalizer was
hardly on his teammates' minds
while they looked for the winner.
Instead of blaming Hunwick, the
Wolverines sought to earn him the
senior-night victory, and that's
exactly what they did.

Six weeks from now, in Tampa,
Fla., does Hunwick skate out as
the Hobey winner? I'd say prob-
ably not. The odds are heavily
stacked against goaltenders from
the beginning. Goal scorers - like
Colgate's Austin Smith, who has
scored 33 times this season - get
all the glory.
But the fact that he's even in the
conversation - and he's certainly
got a strong case going - speaks
volumes. And with a rock-solid
end to the season, he should abso-
lutely get a finalist invitation.
It's safe for me to say it now.
There's not going to be any late-sea-
son recoil on Hunwick's part. And I
won't print a retraction if he chokes
down the stretch. But something
tells me he won't. That wouldn't be
a storybook ending to Tiny Jesus'
fairy-tale career, which I'm left to
believe still has some pages to fill.

Captain lifts Michigan on senior night

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
A year later, it was senior night,
it was a CCHA title race, and it was
overtime.
A year later, it was a captain, it
was a game winner, and it was a
slap shot from the left wing.
A year later, it was Michigan.
Again.
This time, Luke Glendening did
it his way, and the captain - who
doesn't like talking about him-
self - couldn't find the words to
describe the night.
"I don't know," the senior for-
ward said. "We've been fortunate
both (senior nights), I'll tell you
that. But I don't know. But, yeah
- I don't know. It would be nicer
if we just won it in regulation, but
hopefully next year they'll figure
that out."
Three hundred sixty-four days
before Glendening forced the
turnover against No. 20 Northern
Michigan and assisted junior for-
ward A.J. Treais' overtime goal, a
different Michigan captain led the
Wolverines to a dramatic senior-
night victory in overtime.

Last year, Carl Hagelin did it
the way Carl Hagelin should. He
scored twice - with seconds left
in regulation then again with two
seconds remaining in overtime
- to give Michigan an unforget-
table win over Western Michigan.
Glendening put his own stamp on
Saturday night's game with a goal,
the game-winning assist to junior
forward A.J. Treais and his char-
acteristic brand of hard-working
hockey.
Not bad for a former walk-on.
"Is it a coincidence that Luke
Glendening gets a goal and an
assist tonight on senior night?"
asked Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "I don't think so. I don't think
it was a coincidence Carl Hagelin
saved the night last year.
"It's a special night for those
players, and they're the only ones
that know what it feels like. The
other players, they don't get it yet."
Glendeninggot it. After Friday's
game, Berenson said he was play-
ing the best hockey of his career,
and he didn't even record a point.
But that's not Glendening's style.
Instead, Berenson says that he's
the team's hardest worker, fore-

checker and penalty killer.
During practice, Glendening
refuses to get beat by anyone in
sprints.
On Saturday, he tallied Michi-
gan's first goal of the night in the
second period with a wrister that
beat Northern Michigan goalie
Reid Ellingson. It was Glenden-
ing's eighth goal of the year, and
his first in more than a month.
After the game went into over-
time, Glendening intercepted a
pass by Wildcat defenseman Wade
Epp and sent a cross-ice pass to
Treais, who one-timed the puck
into the goal.
The pass was more or less rou-
tine, but the play to get the puck
- where Glendening anticipated a
blind pass along the boards in the
Wildcat zone - was trademark
Glendening.
So was his explanation.
"(Epp) just didn't really have
anywhere else to go," Glendening
said. "He would've had to go cross
ice, and most 'D' don't like to do
that, especially in overtime. So I
guess I got lucky."
Almost four years ago, Glenden-
ino was an unheralded freshman

- unsure of his role on the team
or whether a role for him even
existed.
Glendening needed one prac-
tice to prove he belonged, a few
weeks to prove he could stay and
two years to become a two-year
captain.
"He just turned himself into a
player within weeks," Berenson
said. "He practiced his way into
the lineup, and he stayed in the
lineup, and he's been rock solid,.
and he gets better every year.
"You talk about a character
kid, and a work ethic and a no-
nonsense, great-student athlete.
That's the kind of kid you want at
Michigan."
In the Michigan locker room
after the game, Berenson wrote
two words on the board:
WILL
WANT
The coach pointed to the top
one.
"Was this a factor tonight?"
Berenson asked his team. "Did that
become a factor? I don't know if
Luke Glendening willed this ... but
that's what it takes, boys. That's
what it takes."
