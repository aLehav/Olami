Measure doesn't

Despite garnering a majority
of votes from representatives,
the assembly failed to pass a
resolution Tuesday night that

would limit speakers during
the community concerns por-
tion of Central Student Govern-
ment meetings after it did not
achieve the two-thirds major-
ity necessary to amend CSG
operating procedures.
The resolution - which
received 12 votes in favor, 10
votes in opposition and one
abstention - was proposed last
week, and would have allowed
non-students only one oppor-

tunity per semester to address
CSG in regards to non-agenda
items. The, policy would have
hampered efforts by anti-Isra-

The Ann Arbor Transit
Authority's board of directors
filed Articles of Incorporation
with the Washtenaw County
Clerk on Tuesday to formally

begin the process of expanding
transit services throughout the
county.
The new countywide transit
program will expand and cre-
ate new services in participat-
ing communities as part of the
authority's Five-Year Transit
Program.
Some of the proposed coun-
ty-wide services include more
parking spaces for the Park
and Ride program, more bus
stops and new technology
with real-time travel informa-
tion. Current services - such

as the door-to-door service for
disabled residents and seniors
- will also be extended and
improved upon in the commu-
nities, according to the pro-
posal.
Ford said in an AATA press
release that the prospect of
countywide expansion has
been well received by the com-
munity.

Group campaigns for public art millage

By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
As part of an effort to advo-
cate for the city's proposed pub-
lic art millage, a small group of
Ann Arbor residents have start-
ed holding a number of events,

including parties at restaurants
and shops, a pig roast, a concert
and dinners at homes of notable
locals like Ann Arbor Mayor
John Hieftje.
Citizens for Art in Public
Places, an independent group of
residents vying for a public arts
proposal, has initiated the blitz
campaign in support of the pro-
posal. Most of the events, which
have been scheduled between
Sept. 26 and this Sunday, are
volunteer-driven by various resi-

dents, according to campaign
manager Mike Henry.
The proposed millage would
generate about $459,273 in rev-
enue its first year of operation
and would pay for the addition of
art in public spaces throughout
the city.
Henry said he organized the
fundraisers in attempt to raise

With first debate
tonight, panel talks
contested issue
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
On the eve of the first presi-
dential debate, some of the
nation's foremost experts on the
contested subject of health care
policy converged to discuss the
nuances and complications of
U.S. health care reform.

During Tuesday's event, pan-
elists discussed the trials and
tribulations of health care policy
in the United States and ana-
lyzed the role it has played in
the upcoming election. The dis-
cussion was the second of two
forums hosted by the Ross Office
of Tax Policy Research at the
Ross School of Business, that are
designed to raise awareness of
prominent campaign issues.
David Leonhardt, the Wash-
ington bureau chief for The New
York Times, said during the
event that health care reform

has been a critical and divisive
topic of presidential debate for
decades.
"(Health care) is a hugely
complicated problem, and that's
why you see it in the subject
of some of the most difficult,
toughest political fights we have
had in this country really for 80
years," Leonhardt said.
He noted that all former pres-
idents who have tried to reform
U.S. health care policy were
unsuccessful.

NOT SO QUIET TIME

Dancers promote Korean pop

As shown by the viral popu-
larity of South Korean rapper
Psy's "Gangnam Style," Kore-
an pop is becoming increas-
ingly popular in the United
States and at the University.
To foster student interest
in K-Pop culture, the Univer-
sity's K-Pop Dance Factory
club provides an open forum
for University students that
enjoy K-Pop music and dance.
Members also prepare rou-
tines and give various perfor-
mances on campus. .

sophomore and president
of the club, said most mem-
bers developed an interest

listen said LSA junior Liya
Palmer, the group's vice presi-
dent.
"Once I heard the music,
I was like, I love this ... (and)
I became obsessed with it,"
Palmer said.
Both club leaders empha-
sized, that the group wel-
comes people of all ethnicities
or backgrounds, and members
do not have to be Korean. The
only requirement is a shared
love for K-Pop.
The club holds rigorous

practices in the fall semester
in preparation for its winter
semester shows every year.
They typically perform four
or five times a year, and cho-
reograph each show differ-
ently. Popular K-Pop songs
such as "Bubble Pop," "The
Boys," "Gee" and "Gangnam
Style" are regularly used in
their routines.
The group performed on
Saturday at the University's
Chuseok event, which was
based on traditional Korean
harvest festivals. Other annu-
al performances include the
Chinese New Year festivals
and Chinese Moon Festival.

U.S. begins flying deportees to
\ Mexico to relieve border cities

KINCHEUNG/AP
Workers check on a salvaged boat which sank previous night after colliding with a ferry near Lamma Island, off the
southwestern coast of Hong Kong Island Tuesday.
7 crew Cmembers arrested
as two boats collie in Hong

38 killed in
accidental collision,
police say crew did
not act safely
HONG KONG (AP) - Police
arrested seven crew members
from two boats that collided in
Hong Kong waters, killing 38
holiday revelers, but offered no
explanation about how the ves-
sels ran into each other on a clear
night in one of the safest and most
regulated waterways in Asia.
The Monday night crash was
Hong Kong's deadliest accident in
more than 15 years and its worst
maritime accident in more than
40. Some relatives of the dead
went to the scene off Hong Kong
island's southwestern coast to
toss spirit money in honor of the
victims on Tuesday, while others
waited at the morgue for news
about loved ones.
Police Commissioner Tsang
Wai-hung said six people were
detained on suspicion of endan-
gering passengers by operat-

ing their craft in an unsafe way.
Police later announced a seventh
arrest.
Tsang said both crews are sus-
pected of having not "exercised
the care required of them by law,"
but he did not elaborate.
A ferry collided with the
Lamma IV, which is owned by the
Hong Kong Electric Co. and was
taking more than 100 employees
and their families to famed Vic-
toria Harbor to watch a fireworks
display in celebration of China's
National Day and mid-autumn
festival.
The government said 101 peo-
ple weresent to hospitals, 66 were
discharged, and four had serious
injuries or were in critical condi-
tion.
The ferry was damaged but
completed its journey, and some
of its passengers were treated for
injuries. Local TV later showed
its bow chewed up and chunks
missing.
Hong Kong and Kowloon
(Ferry) Holdings Ltd., the ferry
operator, did not return calls
seekingcomment.
The government said 28 bod-

ies were recovered overnight, and
eight more people were declared
dead at hospitals. Two bodies
found aboard the vessel Tuesday
raised the death toll to 38, accord-
ing to government statements.
At least four of those killed were
children.
Salvage crews raised the half-
submerged Lamma IV using
three crane barges.
At the same time, several dozen
relatives of victims traveled by
boat to take part in a traditional
Chinese mourning ritual, praying
alongside Taoist priests and toss-
ing spirit money into the wind.
Survivors told local television
stations that the power com-
pany boat started sinking rap-
idly after the 8:23 p.m. collision.
One woman said she swallowed
a lot of water as she swam back
to shore. A man said he had been
on board with his children and
didn't know where they were.
Neither gave their names.
Though there was no immedi-
ate word about how the collision
occurred on Hong Kong's tightly
regulated waterways, it appeared
human error was involved.

Flights run twice
weekly from El
Paso, Texas to
Mexico City
SAN DIEGO (AP) - The U.S.
government began flying Mexi-
can deportees home on Tues-
day in a two-month experiment
aimed at relieving Mexican bor-
der cities overwhelmed with
people ordered to leave the Unit-
ed States.
The flights will run twice a
week from El Paso, Texas, to
Mexico City until Nov. 29, at
which time both governments
will evaluate the results and
decide whether to continue. The
first flight left Tuesday with 131
Mexicans aboard.
The flights are not voluntary,
unlike a previous effort from
2004 to 2011 to deport Mexicans
arrested by the Border Patrol
during Arizona's deadly summer
heat.
The U.S. government will pay
for the flights, and the Mexican
government will pay to return
people from Mexico City to their
hometowns, U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement said
in a news release.
ICE spokeswoman Nicole
Navas said Mexicans from that
country's northern border states
will not be eligible. The Mexican
government did not immediate-
ly respond to requests for com-
ment Tuesday.
The experiment comes as
Mexican cities along the U.S.
border are grappling with large
numbers of deportees who have
no roots, few employment pros-
pects and sometimes limited
Spanish. Many are deported to
cities that are among the hard-
est hit by organized crime in
Mexico, particularly across the
border from Texas in the state of
Tamaulipas.
"The newly repatriated, often
with no means to return home,
are susceptible to becoming
part of criminal organizations
as a means of survival," Gustavo
Mohar, Mexico's interior under-

secretary for population, migra-
tion and religious affairs, said in
a statement released by ICE.
ICE Director John Morton said
the flights "willbetter ensure that
individuals repatriated to Mexico
are removed in circumstances
that are safe and controlled."
ICE, which is managing the
flights, said passengers will
include Mexicans with criminal
convictions in the United States
and those who don't have any.
They will be taken from through-
out the United States to a process-
ing center in Chaparral, N.M.,
before being put on flights at El
Paso International Airport.
President Barack Obama's
administration has made
migrants with criminal convic-
tions a top priority among the
roughly 400,000 people of all
nationalities who are deported
each year. The Department of
Homeland Security said nearly
half of the 293,966 Mexicans
deported in its last fiscal year
had criminal convictions in the
United States.
The policy has fueled concern

in Mexican cities along the U.S.
border that deportees are being
victimized, turn to petty crime
or are recruited by criminal
gangs. In February, Homeland
Security Janet Napolitano and
Mexican Interior Secretary Ale-
jandro Poire announced plans
for a pilot program, which was
to begin April 1, but negotiations
delayed the start until Tuesday.
Homeland Security officials said
the time was needed considering
the complexities and logistics of
the effort.
The Border Patrol will not
participate in the flights, which
is called the Interior Repatria-
tion Initiative, Navas said.
Under a previous effort, some
Mexicans who were arrested
by the Border Patrol in Arizo-
na's stifling summer heat were
offered a free flight to Mexico
City, but they could refuse. The
Mexican Interior Repatriation
Program flights carried 125,164
passengers at a cost of $90.6
million from 2004 to 2011, or an
average of $724 for each passen-
ger, according to ICE.

The district was trying to push

Federal grants will support

their DNA in the water, officials
said Tuesday.
The U.S. Environmental Pro-

universities and nonprofit orga-
nizations for invasive species
research studies. In addition to
warding off future attacks, the

A member of a leading human

The lawyer for Yacine Zaid said
Tuesday that his client had been

when they arrested him at a road
block in Ouargla, 700 kilometers
(435 miles) south of the capital.
The lawyer, Sidhoum Mohamed

Monday on the ground that he
had shown a lack of respect for
police.
The daily El Watan reported
that Zaid would go on trial Mon-

Kismayo takes power

Army says it is now

last Somali city in
rebellion
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -
Allied African troops have
taken full control of Kismayo in
Somalia, the last stronghold of
Islamist rebels who have been
fighting against the country's
internationally backed govern-
ment, a Kenyan military official
said Tuesday.
Remnants of the militants,
known as al-Shabab, executed
seven civilians who did not
support them in the southern
part of Kismayo on Monday, the
Kenyan military said.
Kenya Defense Forces and
the Somali National Army
are now patrolling the streets
of Kismayo, Kenyan military
spokesman Maj. Emmanuel
Chirchir said through Twit-
ter. He said that the troops had
secured the city's central police
station and the new airport. He
said military aircraft will start
landing there.

Kenyan troops invaded the
southern Somali city of Kis-
mayo early Friday, and al-Qai-
da-linked al-Shabab announced
soon after that their forces were
leaving the lucrative port town.
After years of bloody street-
by-street warfare, African
Union troops from Uganda and
Burundi pushed al-Shabab out
of Somalia's capital of Moga-
dishu in August 2011. The AU
troops have since taken over
towns outside of Mogadishu
as well. Kenyan forces invaded
Somalia late last year, and have
been moving slowly toward
Kismayo.
The once-powerful al-Sha-
bab spent years defending its
Mogadishu territory, but since
being forced out it has chosen
to retreat from towns when
challenged by African Union
forces or Ethiopian troops who
moved into western Somalia
earlier this year.
Allied African troops sent by
the African Union are helping
Somalia's fragile government to
restore order to the failed state
that has been in chaos since
warlords overthrew a longtime

dictator in 1991.
Analysts expect that now
that al-Shabab has been forced
from all of Somalia's major
cities, the group will resort
to guerrilla tactics such as
suicide attacks and roadside
bombs. Al-Shabab claimed
through Twitter Tuesday that
it had set off huge explosions
targeting allied troops and
killed scores attempting to
enter a regional administra-
tion building.
But the Kenyan forces dis-
puted al-Shabab's claim. Bomb
experts had simply detonated
improvised explosive devices
planted at the new airport,
said Kenyan army spokesman
Chirchir.
Residents in Kismayo said a
hand grenade had been thrown
at a Somalia government vehi-
cle and exploded without caus-
ing any casualties.
Claims about fighting in
Somalia are difficult to verify.

Outreach, changes
in policy account
for diversity
As the Supreme Court revis-
its the use of race in college
admissions next week, critics
of affirmative action are hope-
ful the justices will roll back
the practice. A new report out
Wednesday offers a big reason
for their optimism: evidence
from at least some of the nine
states that don't use affirma-
tive action that leading public
universities can bring mean-
ingful diversity to their cam-
puses through race-neutral
means.
That conclusion is vigor-
ously disputed by support-
ers of race-based affirmative
action, including universities
in states like California which
cannot under state law fac-
tor race into admissions deci-
sions. The new report, by the
Richard Kahlenberg, a senior
fellow at the Century Founda-
tion and prominent advocate of
class-based affirmative action,
calls those states' race-neutral
policies largely successful.
The University of California
and others call them a failure
that's left their campuses inad-
equately representative of the
states they serve.
Kahlenberg also acknowl-
edges that highly selective
universities like UCLA and
the Universities of California-
Berkeley and Michigan haven't
recovered from drop-offs in
minority enrollments after
voters in those states outlawed
racial preferences.
But in most places, the report
argues, a combination of mea-
sures - aggressive outreach,
de-emphasizing of standard-
ized tests, affirmative action
based on class instead of race,
and even getting rid of legacy
preferences that mostly benefit
whites - has allowed minority
representation on their cam-
puses to recover to previous

levels.
Seven states have banned
racial preferences in admis-
sions outright - Washington,
Michigan, Nebraska, Arizona,
New Hampshire, Californiaand
Florida. In Texas and Georgia
leading public universities use a
race-neutral system, though the
University of Texas has main-
tained some use of affirmative
action. It's that policy at UT
that's now before the court in a
casebroughtbyAbigail Fisher, a
rejected white applicant. Argu-
ments are next Wednesday.
In its last two major affirma-
tive action decisions, in 1978
and 2003, the court essentially
took universities at their word
when they argued it's impos-
sible to achieve adequate racial
diversity without factoring race
into admissions. But in the 2003
decision, involving the Univer-
sity of Michigan, the court also
indicated it would pay close
attention to race-neutral exper-
iments in the states to make
sure racial preferences were
really necessary to achieve
diversity.
This time around, the swing
vote is likely Justice Anthony
Kennedy, who dissented in the
case nine years ago, precisely
because he believed colleges
need to try harder to achieve
diversity by other means before
resorting to racial preferences.
"It's the central question in
Fisher: whether race-neutral
alternativeswill work," Kahlen-
berg said.
Kahlenberg says the state
data, compiled by Halley Potter,
shows they do.
At the University of Wash-
ington, for instance, black and
Latino enrollment fell after the
use of race was banned but has
since surpassed previous lev-
els. At the University of Florida,
Hispanic enrollment is higher
and black enrollment is compa-
rable to before race was banned
(though the report's figures
show black enrollment has fall-
en lately from nearly 15 percent
to below 10 percent).

Pope's butler declares innocence
in charges of aggravated theft

Assistant says he
made photocopies
in broad daylight
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Benedict XVI's onetime but-
ler declared Tuesday he was
innocent of a charge of aggra-
vated theft of the pope's private
correspondence, but acknowl-
edged he photocopied the
papers and said he feels guilty
that he betrayed the trust of the
pontiff he loves like a father.
Paolo Gabriele took the stand
Tuesday in a Vatican court-
room to defend himself against
accusations of his role in one
of the most damaging scandals
of Benedict's pontificate. Pros-
ecutors say Gabriele stole the
pope's letters and documents
alleging power struggles and
corruption inside the Vatican
and leaked them to a journal-
ist in an unprecedented papal
security breach.
Gabriele faces four years
in prison if he is found guilty,
although most Vatican watch-
ers expect he will receive a
papal pardon if he is convicted.
During Tuesday's hear-
ing, Gabriele's attorney com-
plained that her client spent
his first 20 days in Vatican
detention in a room so small
he couldn't stretch his arms
out and with lights kept on
24 hours a day. Vatican police
swiftly defended their treat-
ment of Gabriele, but the
Vatican prosecutor opened an
investigation regardless.
Prosecutors have said Gabri-
ele, 46, has confessed to leaking
copies of the documents to Ital-
ian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi,
because he wanted to expose
the "evil and corruption" in the
church. They quoted him as
saying in a June 5 interrogation
that even though he knew tak-
ing the documents was wrong,
he felt inspired by the Holy
Spirit "to bring the church back

on the right track."
Judge Giuseppe Dalla Torre
asked Gabriele on Tuesday if he
stood by his confession. Gabri-
ele responded: "Yes."
Asked, though, by his attor-
ney Cristiana Arru how he
responded to the charge of
aggravated theft, Gabriele said:
"I declare myself innocent con-
cerning the charge of aggravat-
ed theft. I feel guilty of having
betrayed the trust of the Holy
Father, whom I love as a son
would."
He insisted he had no accom-
plices, though he acknowledged
that many people inside the
Vatican, including cardinals,
trusted him and would come
to him with their problems
and concerns. He said he felt
inspired by his faith to always
give them a listen.
He acknowledged he photo-
copied papal documentation,
but insisted he did so in plain
view of others and during day-
light office hours, using the
photocopier in the office he
shared with the pope's two pri-
vate secretaries.
The trial opened over the
weekend inside the intimate
ground-floor tribunal in the
Vatican's courthouse tucked
behind St. Peter's Basilica.
Dalla Torre has said he expects
it to be over within three more
hearings.
In addition to Gabriele, the
court heard Tuesday from four
witnesses, including the pope's
main private secretary, Mon-
signor Georg Gaenswein, who
along with Gabriele was the
closest assistant to the pontiff.
Gaenswein testified that he
began having suspicions about
Gabriele after he realized three
documents that appeared in
Nuzzi's book could only have
come from their shared office.
"This was the moment when
I started to have my doubts,"
Gaenswein said.
The book, "His Holiness:

Pope Benedict XVI's private
papers," became an immedi-
ate blockbuster when it was
published May 20, detailing
intrigue and scandals inside the
Apostolic Palace. The leaked
documents seemed primar-
ily aimed at discrediting Bene-
dict's No. 2, Cardinal Tarcisio
Bertone, often criticized for
perceived shortcomings in run-
ning the Vatican administra-
tion.
Gaenswein said as soon as he
read the book, he immediately
asked the pope's permission to
convene a meeting of the small
papal family to ask each mem-
ber if he or she had taken the
documentation.
One member, Cristina Cer-
netti, one of the pope's four
housekeepers, told the court
she knew immediately that
Gabriele was to blame because
she could exclude without a
doubt any other member of the
family.
In an indication of the
respect Gabriele still feels for
Gaenswein, he stood up from
his bench when Gaenswein
entered the courtroom and then
again when he exited. Gaens-
wein seemed to not acknowl-
edge him.
The trial resumes Wednes-
day with the testimony of four
members of the Vatican police
force who conducted the search
of Gabriele's Vatican City apart-
ment on May 23. In testimony
Tuesday, two police officers
said they discovered thousands
of papers in Gabriele's studio,
some of them originals.
During the testimony, the
lawyer Arru complained about
the conditions . under which
Gabriele spent his first 20
days in detention - conditions
which Gabriele said contribut-
ed to his "psychological depres-
sion."
Dalla Torre asked the pros-
ecutor to open an investigation,
which he did.

Mich. legal system in
overdrive before Nov.

State Supreme
Court hears six
ballot proposals
DETROIT (AP) - The
November ballot in Michigan
will be peppered with measures
that endured legaltussles justto
make it there, and some politi-
cal observers say they can't
remember an election where
courts played such a major role.
Several high-stakes bal-
lot proposals were challenged
all the way to the Michigan
Supreme Court. The justice
system also had a role in a west
Michigan state lawmaker's
party switch and a longtime
congressman's decision not to
run again after staffers were
accused of falsifying petition
signatures.
Some argue there's nothing
improper about people turn-
ing to the court system to fight
for what they believe are their
rights, but others contend the
electorate can become polar-
ized when litigation merges
with policymaking.
"It really points to the divi-
siveness and severe parti-
sanship we see in Lansing,
Washington, D.C., and gener-
ally divides the politics among
us," said Eric Lupher, director
of local affairs for the nonprofit,
nonpartisan.Citizens Research
Council of Michigan. "This
year, I think we can probably
argue that the planets are align-
ing... (and) that draws attention
to these things."
At the front of the litigation
line are the six ballot proposals
spawning a raft of attacks and
counterattacks in courtrooms
as well as in the media. The
state's highest court last month

approved three: whether to
strengthen collective bargain-
ing rights, allow construction of
bridges a'nd tunnels to Canada,
and require a supermajority in
the Legislature to raise taxes.
Each would amend the Michi-
gan Constitution - a concern
for critics.
"Special interests have kind
of hijacked, in my view, what
was intended by the writers
of the 1963 constitution. Most
of them literally are going to
require a whole bunch of new
lawsuits to resolve if any of
them pass," said Bill Rustem,
senior policy adviser to Gov.
Rick Snyder. "Everybody who's
got a special interest has dis-
covered the way to get your idea
done. ... If you can't deal with
representative democracy, you
just hire people to gather signa-
tures for you."
Still, not everyone sees ram-
pant polarization or problems
with the system, even as they
acknowledge the high number
oflitigation-fueledballotissues.
"Our constitution provides
for referenda and initiatives,
which I think is good," Michi-
gan Attorney General Bill
Schuette said. "This is people
speaking their minds in many
cases.
Is it perfect? No, but it's the
best system going."
Signature-gathering is at the
heart of another legal battle
brewing in the run-up to the
election. Four ex-campaign
staffers of former Michigan
U.S. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter
were charged in August with
forging or falsifying signa-
tures on nominating petitions a
month after his resignation. He
wasn't charged, but Schuette
said McCotter was "asleep at
the switch."

Hold Adidas accountable
'U' may need to respond with concrete action
didas is one of the University's largest partners in athletic
gear and one of the largest companies in its industry. But
recent controversy regarding the company's working con-
ditions in Indonesia has elicited a response from University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman. In a letter to the corporation, Coleman
stated her disappointment with its compensation for workers after
the unanticipated closure of the PT Kizone factory. Coleman also
outlined the University's expectations for Adidas moving forward.
While this is a commendable gesture, it's crucial that the University
reconsider its relationship with the company. The University must
respond with concrete action if Adidas fails to respect the situation
of all its employees.

Cut through campaign talk

recently came across a Wash-
ington Post column, "The truth
deficit from both campaigns."
In this column,
Robert Samu-
elson details
what each cam-
paign isn't tell-
ingus about the
true economic
situation of the
country. Cov- HARSHA
ered up by cam- NAHATA
paign rhetoric,
both candidates
are ignoring blatant truths that
may threaten the economic future
of the country.
President Barack Obama, accord-
ing to Samuelson, conveniently,
refrains from discussing the larger
issue of the uncontrollable growth
of Social Security and Medicare,
and how these programs are quick-
ly becoming unsustainable burdens
on the federal budget. If these poli-
cies are kept as is, they would result
in a total added deficit of $10 tril-
lion between 2013 and 2022. It is
also estimated that by 2022, the
deficit is expected to be $1.4 trillion
- 5.5 percent of U.S. GDP.
Obama's plans to tax higher
income sector and revenue still
won't close the gap, even if income
tax rates are raised as high as 49.6
percent of income. According to
Third Way - a think tank striving
to answer America's tough ques-
tions - if Social Security and Medi-
care see no change, tax increases
of up to 60 percent are 'inevitable'
for the middle class. No matter how
it's sugarcoated, the truth remains
that eventually Social Security and
Medicare will overtake the GDP to
the point of financial instability.
But no one wants to tell us that.
The facts aren't being hidden
on one side alone. Samuelson pins
Republican presidential candidate
Mitt Romney for stretching the

truth and mitigating the bad as
well..Romney's goal to cut the fed-
eral budget by 20 percent isn't via-
ble, Samuelson says. For Romney to
do so, he would have to make dras-
tic cuts to significant social pro-
grams, like the Center for Disease
Control, the FBI and border author-
ities. Moreover, Romney's claim to
provide tax cuts won't work. The
need for revenue is so great that to
close the gap, an increase in rates is
necessary. Since 1972, tax revenue
has only made up 18 percent of GDP.
This has to increase if the goal is to
curb deficit spending.
Again, the point is made that
unless programs like Social Secu-
rity and health expenditures are
railed in, there isn't a comprehen-
sive solution to the growing deficit
and debt. This is something that
neither campaign wants to admit.
What stuck out to me about Sam-
uelson's column weren't the glaring
truths that we as a nation have yet
to face - that's a debate for a later
time. What was striking was the
fact that we continue to be oblivi-
ous to these issues. The structures
and programs we have in place are
quickly becoming outdated and
unsustainable, and yet we keep
trying to convince ourselves that
maybe if enough Band-Aids are
used, we'll be able to magically
make the problem disappear.
It's no surprise that campaigns
are catering to what people want to
hear, but it's concerning when we -
the American public - don't want to
hear the harsh reality of the policy
decisions facing us today. The rea-
son candidates won't tell us these
hard truths is because they don't
think doing so will win them votes.
They don't believe we want to hear
the truth.
This isn't the first time that an
article like Samuelson's column has
been written. The reality is that in
the upcoming years, we as a nation

are going to have to face tough cuts
to many programs that people have
come to love and rely on. But those
cuts have to be made. And the soon-
er they're made, the better.
We need to
demand the
truth from
politicians.
As Thomas Friedman described
in a Dec. 25, 2010 column in The
New York Times, Kasim Reed,
mayor of Atlanta, recognized this
and made the tough cuts needed to
balance the budget. Reed was quot-
ed as saying, "The bottom line is that
for the country to do and to be what
we have been ... there mustbe a gen-
eration tough enough to stick out
its chin and take the hit. It is time
to begin having the types of mature
and honest conversations necessary
to deal effectively with the new eco-
nomic realities we are facing as a
nation. We simply cannot keep kick-
ing the can down the road."
Now, the solution isn't to take an
ax to the budget, cutting anything
and everything. But, it's also not
fair to keep delaying the conversa-
tion with campaign promises to
save programs that at some point
will need to be significantly pared
down. As Reed said, it's about being
honest about the conversations we
need to have and the position we're
'in. Though, for the American public
to get that honesty, we must start
demanding it from our politicians,
election season or not.

After the April 2011 closure of the PT
Kizone factory in Indonesia, Adidas didn't
compensate more than 2,700 workers with
the required $1.5 million in salaries, ben-
efits and severance. Instead, the company
attempted to place this responsibility on the
factory owner. This neglect prompted action
from the University of Wisconsin and Cornell
University. Adidas has since announced plans
to discuss future steps with other corpora-
tions and insurance companies. However, the
company's poor and delayed response to the
issue warranted a reaction from Coleman.
The letter called for humanitarian aid as well
as monthly updates on the company's interac-
tion with PT Kizone, employment for former
workers and collaboration with the Indone-
sian government.
This letter is an important step in giving
attention to an issue we're all connected to.
It's especially important for our school to
send the right message, as the University is
in agood position to exert influence. The con-
tract between Michigan and Adidas is worth
$7.5 million each year. Over the course of the
contract, the University will earn $60 mil-
lion. The University should make use of its
clout in this area and promote a change in
Indonesian working conditions.
Coleman's letter is a compelling call for

humane corporate practices. However, the
mistreatment of factory workers is hardly
a new concern, and it requires adequate
responses. Adidas' negligence has already
driven the University of Wisconsin to file a
lawsuit. Similarly, Cornell University sev-
ered its relationship to the corporation sev-
eral days ago. Michigan should certainly keep
both of these developments in-mind and fol-
low suit if necessary.
Although Michigan's contract with Adi-
das does not expire until 2017, we should
seriously consider changing sponsors if the
company doesn't correct its mistreatment of
workers . This dispute is especially unaccept-
able considering the contract's terms regard-
inghuman rights. Adidas' currentmisconduct
is similar to that of Nike, Michigan's previous
vendor. Just as Michigan switched sponsors
in 2007, we should consider the same course
if the workers's needs are not met.
The circumstances in Indonesia require
concrete action, if not on the part of Adidas,
then by the University itself. President Cole-
man's letter is admirable, and will hopefully
inspire genuine change. But, if Adidas contin-
ues to mistreat these former employees, the
University should use its predominant posi-
tion in the world of athletic sponsorship to
promote necessary change.

BRANDON SHAW I
An ode to The Boss

Bruce Springsteen last performed in Ann
Arbor 32 years ago today, and I'd like to use
the anniversary as an opportunity to express
my adoration for him and his music. But more
importantly, I want to attempt to explain why
Springsteen, who turned 63 a little more than
a week ago, is in fine pitch with the tune of
America and the world today.
At 63, Spingsteen is still performing shows
that last more than four hours; he is cajoling,
screaming, running, sliding, whispering, beck-
oning and then doing it all over again. When
asked why the show exemplifies the true con-
cept of a performance, he has often said that
he's "in a lifelong conversation with [his] audi-
ence; the theatrics are a necessary part of tell-
ing our story, of connecting together."
But it isn't the four-hour shows that please
his fans. It's his ability, in all of the tenets of
a live performance and each facet of what he
does to remain, by a long measure, the most rel-
evant artist of our day.
Many front men today utilize similar stage
theatrics and attempt to convey the emotion
like Springsteen. They make political referenc-
es and form connections with their audience.
But Springsteen, though he has backed Demo-
cratic causes and candidates his entire life,
continues to be so relevant for the same reason
he isn't publically endorsing a candidate this
election cycle. He's the physical embodiment of
America - discomforted by too much instabil-
ity to remain one-sided, divided and overly con-
cerned with politics to take a stance. Even in
the self-mockery of the live performance, as he
laughs off his own fortune: "People at the top,
these rich guitar players, have been given a free
pass!" Springsteen recognizes that no politici-

zation or professional metaphor can equate to
the intensely emotional and personal journey
of pain and loss that Americais going through.
In the Gaelic-driven warning tale, "Dea'th
to my Hometown," he cautions a "sonny boy"
to "listen up" and "be ready when they come,"
so he better "get yourself a song to sing; sing it
till you're done. Sing it hard and sing it well;
send the robber barons straight to hell. Whose
crimes have gone unpunished now; walk the
streets as free men now."
Springsteen is part youthful performer who
instills a minted vigor and thirst for answers in
every show-goer in the room. But he has also
found his part as the wise older Springsteen,
intent on nailing life lessons into his audience,
and the convergence of these two is precisely
why he remains so relevant.
Bruce Springsteen is the personification of
the cultural identity of America: what America
is meant to be, what it's become and the mea-
surement of the distance between the two.
He exemplifies what America needs and what
it doesn't have: unity, a culture of acceptance,
an impeccable, unparalleled work ethic and
a community that embraces and helps each
other out.
The only mentions of politics throughout the
live show's stories on the current Springsteen
tour are when they are equated to the loss of
people's jobs, relatives, close friends and identi-
ties. "I'm gonna do this for our ghosts aind for
yours," Springsteen says each night, because "if
you're here, and we're here then they're here."
Happy Birthday, Bruce. Thanks for being
here each night. And thanks, for everything.

The Wall Street Journal recently
ran two articles on the changing
tendencies of medicine. The first,
flaunting pictures of surgeons and
scalpels, proudly and bluntly pro-
claimed that medicine has more
preventable and disguised errors
than any other profession. It
accused medicine of cheating the
system of criticism, and holding
itself above efforts to streamline
and perfect. The second, dominated
bythe portraitofa physician, subtly
(Not!) remarked on a "doctor to the
top percent." It told the story of a
referral base for the rich and cor-
porate medicine. And it set up a tale
of selfish medicine, of exploitation
and bureaucracy.
So what's really going on? Are
doctors conspiring to charge higher
fees, to spend less time with each
patient at the same time as seeing
more patients, to neglect admitting
mistakes on purpose, to commit
Medicare fraud and to reject Medi-
care patients, all so that they can go
home sooner with fatter wallets?
Obviously, that's not what's hap-
pening. There's a lot of confusion
about the Affordable Care Act, also
known as Obamacare. The fact is
simple - it won't work, for the same
reasons that doctors are already
charging higher fees and spending
less time with each patient.
Let's discuss why it won't fly, at
least in the way Obama intends it to.
First, define how he intends Obam-
acare to work: about 25 percent
more of the nation will receive the
necessary care they deserve, sim-
ply because they are human beings.
Now that's a novel idea - everyone
deserves care when they're ill. The
problem is where care is coming

from when provided. It's provided
by doctors and by individuals.
So, why is that a problem? Train-
ing to become a doctor is the sin-
gle most time, dollar, brain-cell
and life-consuming professional
development curve since becom-
ing a referee in the National Foot-
ball League. On average, doctors
come out of training at age 32
indebted an estimated $280,000.
They work 80-hour weeks (if you
think hospitals really follow the
new resident rules which, I can tell
you from observing, they don't).
And it doesn't include time spent
researching, reviewing charts,
doing paperwork and any time "off
call" spent in the hospital.
Again, why does this matter? It's
important because medical schools
are not increasing class sizes, not
significantly increasing nation-
ally in number and not decreasing
training requirements. What does
all of this point to? By 2015, there
is an expected shortage of 63,000
doctors across the nation. Training
for doctors isn't becoming any eas-
ier, shorter or cheaper. Couple that
with the 44-percent increase (from
50.7 to 73.2 million) in covered
patients by 2025, and that spells
trouble with a capital "T." Let's just
wave the white flag now.
Back to The Wall Street Jour-
nal articles - what does all of this
signify for medicine? It means two
things: first, that doctors accepting
Medicare will spend even less time
with patients. Less time means less
engagement, insight and foresight.
Those factors add up to more pre-
ventable mistakes, since the focus
would be on quantity, not quality.
Not that the quality w'ould be poor,

just that it will be worse than it is
currently. Second, it means that a
larger contingency of doctors will
switch to private practice.
All in all, this symbolizes the
fragmentation of medicine by
class divisions. It means more
low-income patients will wait lon-
ger for care, provided that they
will indeed, at some point in time,
receiveit.And it points towards the
privatization of the "boutique phy-
sician," who will provide brilliant
care for wealthy patients.
Is this S-graph of medicine really
what we want? Maybe; most doc-
tors are amazingly intelligent and
diligent people, who, despite the
obstacles thrust upon them, will
pursue perfection as they always
have. But to accuse them of selfish-
ness and conspiracy is outrageous.
The well-publicized issues of medi-
cine are derived from external
pressures, not internal motivations.
I've been advised more than once
(or twice or three times) not to go
into medicine for the money but to
do it because it's "the good fight."
With that knowledge, I refute the
fact that doctors are acting solely
in their own interest. The whole
reason they went into medicine is
to care for others, and there was no
sudden change of heart convincing
all physicians otherwise. I'm all in
support of expanding care to the
masses, but we need to look at the
cogs of the operation as well. Ulti-
mately, we need to redefine how to
care for those who care for us. We
must care enough about them to let
them care enough for us.

'Borderlands 2' builds
on success of original

By JULIAN AIDAN
Daily Arts Writer
If you've ever wanted to blow a
shotgun-wielding midget riding a
yeti to smithereens with a rocket-
propelled gre-
nade, you'll
find solace
that, in "Bor- Borderlands2
derlands 2,"
your wish will PC, Xbox 360
be fulfilled not and PS3
too far into the 2k
game. The car-
toonish and
visually striking world of Pandora
once again acts as a backdrop for
the hilariously violent, tongue-in-
cheek sequel to 2009's megahit.
As a new crew of Vault Hunt-
ers arrive in search of treasure,
a satellite A.I. Guardian Angel
begins to communicate with
them, aiding them in their search
for a new Vault, the one from the
first game having disappeared.
The world of Pandora is more or
less run equally by roving bandits
and the Hyperion Corporation,
an ultra-powerful organization
capable of everything from mak-
ing living ponies out of diamonds
to keeping an entire planet under
constant surveillance.
The game is true to its prede-
cessor in bringing nonstop, over-
the-top action and gore to the
player's fingertips. It looks and
feels pretty much the same as
the original "Borderlands," with
the graphics and gameplay hav-
ing evolved little. The game is as
riddled with cheeky Easter eggs
and dark humor as expected. The
constant stream of new quests,
new enemies and nearly infinite
amounts of new weapons keeps
things interesting for the player
as he or she progresses. Each
character has numerous custom-
izable aesthetic options, includ-
ing different heads and costumes,
as well as three very different
skill trees to put points in as they
level up, changing combat han-
dling and providing vastly dif-

Detroit mayor suspends
police chief during probe

by unknown assailants on the highway leading to the city of Cuernavaca, near Tres Marias, Mexico.

in1Mexican police ambush

Officer alleges she
and Godbee had
bad breakup
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing suspended the
city's top law enforcement offi-
cer Tuesday amid allegations
that the married police chief of
police had a sexual relationship
with a subordinate.
Chief Ralph Godbee and
Angelica Robinson, an internal
affairs officer, had been in a rela-
tionship that she eventuallytried
to end, said her attorney, David
Robinson.
"There was a sexual rela-
tionship between my client and
Godbee," Robinson told The
Associated Press on Tuesday
evening. "She was trying to end
the relationship, and Godbee
didn't want to let it go."
She posted a photo with her
service weapon in her mouth
on the social media site Twit-
ter after learning Godbee was
at a police conference over the
weekend with another woman,
David Robinson said.
He said Godbee had other
officers locate the 37-year-old
Angelica Robinson and put her
under surveillance.
"Obviously, it raised the impli-
cation of suicide," David Robin-.
son added. "The story is that she
was hurt he was at a conference
with another woman. Certainly
this has created a lot of pressure.
Unfairly, her future is a little bit

uncertain. She has to suffer the
humiliation."
Angelica Robinson has been
reassigned from internal affairs
to other duties. !
This is the second time in two
years that a Detroit police chief
has been embroiled in scandal.
Godbee's predecessor, Warren
Evans, was fired by Bing in 2010
partly because he was romantical-
ly involved with a female officer.
"After learning of the alle-
gations regarding Chief Ralph
Godbee, I have placed him on
a 30-day suspension pending a
full and thorough investigation
of this matter," the mayor said in
a statement Tuesday that did not
specify the allegations.
Godbee could not be reached
Tuesday afternoon for com-
ment, police spokeswoman Sgt.
Eren Stephens said.
Angelica Robinson, who is
married, told her attorney the
relationship with Godbee lasted
about a year. Godbee is separat-
ed from his wife.
David Robinson said the rela-
tionship was consenasual.
Without being specific, Rob-
inson said he will approach the
city "and see what their posi-
tion would be and hopefully (the
city will) do the right thing" in
regard to his client.
"The chief of police exceeded
his professional status," David
Robinson said. "He's breached
the trust of the department."
Godbee and Bing have been
assailed by officers in recent
weeks over a 10 percent pay cut

and implementation of 12-hour
workdays to help cut millions of
dollars from the police budget.
Officers complain the cuts and
new work rules are too much
to take in a city with one of the
highest violent crime rates in
the country.
The 287 murders committed
through Sept. 23 in Detroit are
26 more than at the same point
last year.
Godbee was named chief in
2010 after Bing fired Evans.
Evans, a former Wayne Coun-
ty sheriff, was appointed chief
by Bing in 2009 and fired after
he raised the mayor's ire by tak-
ing part in a promotional video
for a cable police reality show.
Bing later said he also fired
Evans because the chief was
romantically involved with Lt.
Monique Patterson.
Godbee, too, had a roman-
tic relationship with Patterson
before she began dating Evans
and when she was Godbee's sub-
ordinate.
The prior relationship
between Godbee and Patter-
son was disclosed publicly after
Godbee was named interim
chief, and Bing issued a strongly
worded statement after its dis-
closure saying he wasn't consid-
ering firing Godbee for having
an affair with a subordinate.
Godbee, 44, joined the
department in 1987 and rose to
assistant chief in 2007. He later
retired only to be reappointed
assistant chief in July 2009
when Evans was hired.

Evidence that
police shooters
were working for
cartel
MEXICO CITY (AP) - A
senior U.S. official says there is
strong circumstantial evidence
that Mexican federal police who
fired on a U.S. Embassy vehicle,
wounding two CIA officers, were
working for organized crime in a
targeted assassination attempt.
Meanwhile, a Mexican official
with knowledge of the case con-
firmed on Tuesday that prosecu-
tors are investigating whether
the Beltran Leyva Cartel was
behind the Aug. 24 ambush.
The Mexican official said
that is among several lines of
investigation into the shooting
of an armored SUV that was
clearly marked with diplomatic
license plates on a rural road
near Cuernavaca south of Mex-
ico City. Federal police, at times
battered by allegations of infil-
tration and corruption by drug
cartels, have said the shooting
was a case of mistaken identity
as officers were looking into the
kidnapping of a government
employee in that area.
"That's not a'We're trying to

shake down a couple people for
a traffic violation sort of opera-
tion. That's a 'We are specifi-
cally trying to kill the people in
this vehicle'," a U.S. official,
familiar with the investiga-
tion told The Associated Press.
"This is not a 'Whoops, we got
the wrong people.'"
Photos of the gray Toyota
SUV, a model known to be used
by Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration agents and other U.S.
Embassy employees working in
Mexico, showed it riddled with
heavy gunfire. The U.S. Embassy
called the attack an "ambush."
When asked by the AP if the
Mexican federal police officers
involved in the shooting were
tied to organized crime, the U.S.
official said, "The circumstantial
evidence is pretty damn strong."
Both the U.S. and Mexican
officials spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the sen-
sitivity of the diplomatic issue.
A federal police on Tuesday
maintained the position that
their agents fired on the vehicle
by mistake, thinking it belonged
to a band of kidnappers they
were pursuing, according to a
spokesman who was not autho-
rized to speak on the record.
The U.S. State Department
declined to discuss details.
"We will not comment on

an ongoing investigation," said
William Ostick, a spokesman.
"This is a matter of great sig-
nificance to both our countries
and we will continue to cooper-
ate with Mexican authorities in
their investigation."
The Mexican official said
one line of investigation is
that members of the Beltran
Leyva Cartel were interested in
attacking the people in the car
because some of their lookouts
had seen them passing through
the area and presumed they
were investigating the cartel.
It's possible they didn't know
they were Americans.
The rural road near Cuer-
navaca where the attack took
place is known territory of
the remnants of the Beltran
Leyvas, a once-powerful car-
tel now run by Hector Beltran
Leyva since the Navy killed
his brother, drug lord Arturo
Beltran Leyva, in Cuernavaca
in late 2009. Beltran Leyva
was once aligned with Mexi-
co's powerful cartel, Sinaloa,
headed by fugitive drug lord
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
But the groups split in 2008 and
continued government hits on
Beltran Leyva leadership since
then have splintered that car-
tel into small gangs warring for
the area.

ment battle recently afflicting
teachers and football feferees.
Across the country, sympho-
ny and chamber orchestra exec-
utives have cited flat ticket sales
and slumping private support as
they seek major pay concessions
from musicians, who warn about
a loss of talent and reputation.
In Minneapolis, the Minnesota
Orchestra has already cancelled
concerts through Nov. 25 as
negotiators argue over a propos-
al to trim the average musicians'
salary by $46,000 a year.
A similar standoff is under-
way across the Mississippi River
at the St. Paul Chamber Orches-
tra. The Indianapolis Symphony
Orchestra has canceled the first
month of its season in a labor
impasse, and labor troubles are
also rumbling at orchestras in
Richmond, Va., Jacksonville,
Fla., and San Antonio, Texas.
"It breaks my heart," said
Christal Steele, a violinist and
assistant concertmaster in Indi-
anapolis, where she and fellow
musicians have gone without
pay and benefits for almost a
month. "This is my 40th sea-
son, and in that time, I have seen
nothing but this orchestra rise
in quality and in stature. Now in
one fell swoop, they're trying to
erase the last 30 years."
Last week, musicians and
management at the symphony
orchestras in both Chicago and
Atlanta reached new contracts
after contentious negotiations.
Atlanta's musicians went with-
out pay for a month before
accepting $5.2 million in com-
pensation cuts over two years,
plus reductions in their ranks.
The Chicago deal came after a
two-day strike that forced the
cancellations of the season's
first Saturday night show, with
musicians wrangling salary
increases but agreeing to pay
higher health care costs.
"It's shaking up a lot of orga-
nizations right now," said Drew
McManus, a Chicago-based con-
sultant to orchestras and other
arts organizations. "This world
of orchestras is one that's always
been defined by well-established
strata - the best orchestras in
the country, the second tier and
so on - and that is very much in
flux at the moment."
The Minnesota Orchestra has
seen its reputation grow in recent
years under conductor Osmo
Vanska. The Finnish-born Van-
ska has become something of a
celebrity in a state that treasures
its Scandinavian heritage, and
he's won international acclaim
for pushing the orchestra to new
heights.

Orchestra play at Carnegie Hall

in 2010, The New Yorker's clas-
sical music critic Alex Ross
wrote that they "sounded, to my
ears, like the greatest orchestra
in the world."
But the' orchestra's leaders
have said even as its reputation
grows they've seen flat atten-
dance, declining corporate and
individual support, and poor
results from investments. Mean-
while, salaries grew by 3 to 4
percent annually under the pre-
vious contract.
"You couple that with one of
the worst financial markets of
the last 100 years, and obviously
you have to reset our orchestra
and our organization in terms
of looking to a future that's sus-
tainable," said Michael Hen-
son, the orchestra's president.
He said the orchestra has been
forced to draw too deeply from
its endowment to stay in the
black.
"A very significant part of our
expenses are musicians' sala-
ries, and that's a logical area for
us to address to find a solution
for long-term stability," Henson
said. Management's proposal
would trim average annual sala-
ries for orchestra members from
$135,000 to $89,000.
Doug Wright, the Minnesota
Orchestra's principal trombon-
ist and a member of the musi-
cians' negotiating team, said the
wages reflect the skill involved
in reaching the top level and big
salary cuts would result in a loss
of talent.
"The musicians of a major
American symphony orchestra
live in a global marketplace,"
Wright said. "And if we're going
to continue to attract and retain
the best of the best, our compe-
tition is not, you know, the local
marching band. Our competi-
tion is Boston, Chicago, L.A.,
San Francisco."
McManus, the arts consul-
tant, said the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra took a big blow to its
reputation after a six-month
musicians' strike in 2010, during
which many musicians quit.
Musicians have demanded
an open audit of the orchestras'
finances, complaining about a
$50 million renovationof Orches-
tra Hall's lobby now underway.
Henson said renovation funds
come from dedicated donations
and are needed to keep drawing
audiences and big donors.
Jesse Rosen, president and
chief executive officer of the
League of American Orches-
tras, which doesn't take sides
in labor-management disputes,
said orchestras are struggling
with the economy like many
other businesses that depend on
discretionary spending.

Ross applications down
17 percent from 2011

Border patrol agent
shot dead in Arizona

Business School
mirrors national
trend
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
For the Daily
This year, the number of
applicants to the full-time MBA
program at the Ross School of
Business fell by about 17 percent
from 2011.
The decline of applicants
at the University mirrors an
international trend, as the total
number of MBA applications
decreased globally this year.
According a Sept. 17 article in
the Wall Street Journal, the
median number of applicants
to MBA programs worldwide
declined 22 percent, marking
the fourth consecutive year of
overall decline in applications.
Notable decreases among
U.S. programs include a 19-per-
cent drop at the Columbia Busi-
ness School and a decrease of 12
percent at the New York Univer-
sity Stern School of Business.
The Graduate Management
Admissions Report report -

data of 359 schools - shows that

Savabieasfahani was not
allowed to finish her speech,
but would go on to receive
another warning before the end
of the meeting for attempting
to address the assembly when
she wasn't recognized. She will
not be allowed to speak at next

Tension at the meeting subsid-

second warning of the semester
- preventing him from speak-

ing - for applauding another
anti-Israel speaker, as applaud-
ing speakers during community
concerns is prohibited.

dumbfounded look. Proppe again

informational material.
"There are 99,000 potential
voters in Ann Arbor and those
voters need to understand the
millage," Henry said.. "There
is some confusion in the pub-
lic marketplace about what the
millage would go towards and
why it's important."
Henry said the group primar-
ily hopes to clarify the minimal
cost of the proposed property tax,
which would span three years

 and cost most households about
$11 annually.
"We want the public to know
that it's a small amount," Henry
said.
Despite differing political ide-
ologies, area residents and stu-
dents have united in the effort
to support the art millage and its
potential effect on public art. All

Marcia Higgins (D-Ward 4) and
Jane Lumm (D-Ward 2) - have

pattern than seen in previous
years. Until recently, applica-
tion numbers have correlated
inversely to the overall state
of the world economy - if the
economy declines, application
volume increases and if it peaks,
applications decrease.
Though applications have
decreased 'globally, the report
noted that this year's numbers
show an improvement from pre-
vious post-recession statistics.
Soojin Kwon, the director
of admissions at the Business
School, said she's not concerned
about the decrease in appli-
cants.
"Our drop follows a year in
which we were one of only two
top-ranked schools that posted
an increase in applications,"
Kwon said. "If you look at a
multi-year picture of applica-
tion volume changes, you'll find
that most top-ranked schools
posted declines in at least two
out of the last three years."
Kwon noted that a drop in
application volume doesn't nec-
essarily imply a weaker class.
"Despite the drop in total
applications, we still had more
good candidates than we have
seats for in the class," Kwon
said. "At the end of the day, what,
schools need are enough great
turning to approach the sitting
representatives, vitriolically
raising an anti-Israel sign above
his head and staring down the
executive board.
Later inthe meeting, CSG pres-
ident Manish Parikh addressed
the situation in case any further
incidents unfolded.
"As soon as today's assem-
bly's meeting is over, let's not
hang around much here. We'll
just leave quickly, lock down the
place," he said. "DPS is on stand-
by in case there are any issues."
Parikh also delivered an exec-
utive address to the assembly
in light of previous anti-Israel
speakers decried the assembly's
disinterest in their speeches and
criticized the organization's lack
of diversity.
"We've been accused today
(of being) an assembly ... which
does not have diversity. I want
everyone to take a look around
this room. We have people of
Latino-American ancestry,
Native-American ancestry, of
Indian-American ancestry. We
have Serbian-Americans, we have
Chinese-Americans," he said.
"We are a diverse organization
and we will continue to fight for

applicants to make a great class.
We had that."
Business senior Clarence Ho
said a decrease in admissions
numbers could signify rejuvena-
tion of the economy.
"If you see a decrease in MBA
applicants, I don't think it's
going to be a Ross-specific prob-
lem," Ho said. "It's going to be
an indicator that things are get-
ting better."
MBA student Carlton Gordon
speculated that the decrease
in admissions might be signify
that students are applying to
graduate programs that better
match their career aspirations
rather than their desired salary.
"I think it's good because it
allows the focus to be on people
who actually want to go back
and learn as opposed to people
who are doing it solely to fur-
ther their career," Gordon said.
MBA student Ryan Fukushi-
ma suggested that prospective
graduate students may be more
hesitant to pay for further edu-
cation.
"I don't think it's necessarily
good or bad," Fukushima said.
"I think it's just reflective of
people's perception of the value
they're getting. With the price
increasing, people are more
reluctant to apply."
every single student on campus
no matter what religion of com-
munity they originate from."
The first community concerns
speaker was Law student John
Lin, who served as a representa-
tive in the assembly as an under-
graduate. He said the assembly
faced a similar situation from
protesters in 2009, but was pri-
marily able to prevent them from
speaking at meetings with a reso-
lution.
He encouraged the assembly to
pass the resolution, adding that
as a student, he did not want to
see his representatives discuss
issues that were not pertinent to
students.
During the matters arising
portion of the meeting, Rackham
representative Patrick O'Mahen
said regardless of the outcome
of the resolution, the assembly
already failed to serve its students
since it spent the rest of the meet-
ing extenuating arguments about
divestment from Israel rather
than movingto new topics.
"They baited us and we took
the bait, and we talked about this
again and again," he said. "Please
let's not have any more resolu-
tions on community concerns."

First agent
shooting since
2010 in Mexico
NACO, Ariz. (AP) - A Border
Patrol agent was shot to death
Tuesday in Arizona near the
U.S.-Mexico line, the first fatal
shooting of an agent since a
deadly 2010 firefight with Mexi-
can bandits that spawned con-
gressional probes of a botched
government gun-smuggling
investigation.
The agent,30-year-oldNicho-
las Ivie, and a colleague were on
patrol in the desert near Naco,
about 100 miles from Tucson,
when gunfire broke out shortly
before 2 a.m., the Border Patrol
said. The second agent was shot
in the ankle and buttocks, but
was reportedly in stable condi-
tion.
Authorities have not identi-
fied the agent who was wound-
ed, nor did they say whether any
weapons were seized at the site
of the shooting.
Ata news conference in Naco,
an FBI official said the agency
still was processing the crime
scene and that it might take sev-
eral days to complete. The FBI
and the Cochise County Sher-
iff's Office, which is also inves-
tigating, declined to say whether
investigators have recovered
guns or bullet casings.
No arrests have been made,
but authorities suspect that more
than one person fired at the
agents.
"It's been a long day for us but
it's been longer for no one more
than a wife whose husband is not
coming home. It's been longer
for two children whose father
is not coming home, and that is
what is going to strengthen our

Ivie, who is married, lived in
Sierra Vista with his wife and
their two young daughters.,
President Barack Obama
called Ivie's family Tuesday to
offer condolences and to express
his gratitude for Ivies "selfless
service to his nation," a White
House statement said.
Obama made it clear that
the administration "was doing
everything it could to locate
those responsible."
The last Border Patrol agent
fatally shot on duty was Brian
Terry, who died in a shootout
with bandits near the border
in December 2010. The Border
Patrol station in Naco, where the
two agents shot Tuesday were
stationed, was recently named
after Terry.
Terry's shooting was later
linked to the government's "Fast
and Furious" gun-smuggling
operation, which allowed peo-
ple suspected of illegally buying
guns for others to walk away
from gun shops with weapons,
rather than be arrested.
Authorities intended to track
the guns into Mexico. Two rifles
found at the scene of Terry's
shooting were bought by a mem-
ber of the gun-smuggling ring
being investigated.
Critics of the operation say
any shooting along the border
now will raise the specter those
illegal weapons are still being
used in border violence.
"There's no way to know at
this point how the agent was
killed, but because of Operation
Fast and Furious, we'll wonder
for years if the guns used in any
killing along the border were
part of an ill-advised gun-walk-
ing strategy," Republican Sen.
Chuck Grassley said in a state-
ment.
The Terry family said that the
shooting was a "graphic remind-
er of the inherent dangers that
threaten the safety of those who
AATA board member Jesse
Bernstein said in the press
release that increased public
transit will benefit the city eco-
nomically.
"Good, affordable pub-
lic transportation promotes a
healthier quality of life, attracts
businesses and jobs locally and
helps spur economic develop-
ment throughout our region,"
Bernstein said.
Bernstein, who just finished
his term as chairman of the
board, said the organization's
first priority is fixing present
services.

live and work near the border."
Authorities set up a check-
point on a dirt road about seven
miles southeast of Bisbee. A
Border Patrol truck and another
vehicle carrying two portable
toilets were allowed to drive
past the roadblock.
Agents at the checkpoint
declined to comment and barred
reporters from going further.
Two helicopters from federal
immigration agencies could be
seen from a distance circling the
area. And a fugitive-chase team
could be seen staging on a road-
side.
The area near the shooting is
scattered with houses, trailers
and ranchettes. Mesquite trees
and creosote bushes dot the land-
scape, with a mountain. range
nearby tothe west.
The U.S. government has put
thousands of sensors along the
border that, when tripped, alert
dispatchers thatthey should send
agents to a particularlocation.
The agents were fired upon
in a rugged hilly area about five
miles north of the border as they
responded to an alarm that was
triggered on one of the sensors,
said sheriff's spokeswoman
Carol Capas. It is not known
whether the agents returned
fire, she said.
The agents who were shot
were on patrol with a third
agent,,who was not harmed, said
George McCubbin, president
of the National Border Patrol
Council, a union represent-
ing about 17,000 border patrol
agents.
The Border Patrol said Ivie
worked for the agency since Jan-
uary 2008 and grew up in Provo,
Utah. He worked as an emer-
gency medical technician before
joining the Border Patrol, said
his'brother-in-law, Todd Davis.
He served a two-year mission
with The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints in Vexico
City after high school.
"Significant gaps exist in the
services being provided now,"
Bernstein said. "Some areas of
Washtenaw County have no
service whatsoever. We need
to ensure our growing elderly
population is able to remain
independent."
Bernstein will lead a district
advisory committee meeting in
October and will address spe-
cific concerns raised by resi-
dents and council members.
The new county-wide ser-
vices will go into effect if voters
from the joining communities
approve funding.


formally endorsed the proposal.
Henry said the passage of pub-
lic arts millage would immensely
benefit the community.
"I think that art is very impor-
tant to our community with
regard to making it competitive,
with regard to economic devel-
opment," Henry said.
Henry also noted that the
proposal would allow Ann
Arbor to continue to be a leader
in public art.
"Ann Arbor is known for
being a leader especially in
Michigan, especially in the U.S.
, for college town culture and
art. I think it is important that
the public make it a priority and
invest in it," he said.
Marsha Chamberlin, CEO of
the Ann Arbor Art Center, said
enthusiasm for the millage has
already spread throughout the
community, and local groups
have reached out specifically to
artists who specialize in tempo-
rary art. She alluded to a project
by Patrick Dougherty, who cre-
ates tent sculptures woven out
of tree branches and is expect-

ed to install a piece on campus
within the next few years.
Chamberlin noted that
Dougherty's sculptures are
temporary due to their natural
composition, and the proposed
millage would fund temporary
artworks like Dougherty's that
otherwise wouldn't receive city
funding.
Ann Arbor public art com-
missioner Theresa Reid said she
endorses the new millage, but
stressed that her support comes
as an area resident and not in
her official capacity as commis-
sioner. Reid is also the executive
director of the UM Arts Engine,
a program that facilitates stu-
dent artists and integrates art-
work throughout the University.
Reid said the millage has
put public art in the spotlight,
which she said will hopefully
bring more artists and tempo-
rary artwork to the city.
"It's just an incredible gift to
have a public art," Reid said. "So
I'm in favor of public art first
and also because of the way this
(new) funding will work."

the whole place."
In addition to maneuver-
ing the libraries through a new
digital age, Evrard said the new
dean will need to be able to
manage day-to-day operations
of the library.
While there are associate
University librarians who work
on the business side of the oper-
ation, Evrard said it's essential
that the new dean is business
savvy.

"The library is a ... $50 mil-
lion operation with over 500
employees," he said. "So it's
a good-sized business to run
so there's just managerial
aspects."
In an e-mail sent to Library
faculty and staff, Provost Han-
lon wrote that Courant spurred
significant innovation while
at the helm of the University
Library.
"With Paul's guidance, the
library has become an interna-
tional leader in areas beyond
digitization," Hanlon wrote.
"His wide-ranging expertise

.. has positioned the library to
engage some of the most press-
ing issues in academia today,
among them the impact of cur-
rent copyright law on research,
scholarship, and learning; the
future of scholarly communi-
cation; and the integration of
technology into teaching and
learning."
Courant is among four deans
- including Law School Dean
Evan Caminker, Dentistry
School Dean Peter Polverini and
LSA Dean Terrence McDonald
- who will leave the University
after this school year.

failed, JFK failed, LBJ failed,
Richard Nixon failed and Bill
Clinton failed," Leonhardt said.
"Nearly everyone who has tried
failed."
Leonhardt noted that the
election is becoming increas-
ingly polarized between vot-
ers who support the Affordable
Care Act and those who believe
it should be repealed, even
though its legality was affirmed
by the U.S. Supreme Court ear-
lier this year.
Jonathan Gruber, a professor
of economics at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said the
country has two primary choices
for the future of health care.
"The fight in this country is
stuck between two extremes:
on the one hand we have the
left, which says we should have

a single health system like Can-
ada ... on the right they say the
system works fine," Gruber said.
Gruber said of the options,
neither is possible or sustain-
able, and the government must
build on the existing system in
formulating effective reform
policies.
He noted that Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Rom-
ney accomplished this medium
with his health care policy
when he was governor of Mas-
sachusetts. The Affordable Care
Act was modeled after the Mas-
sachusetts law.
"When Mitt Romney was
governor of Massachusetts, he
proposed a third way, which I
call incremental universalism,"
Gruber said. "What it really is,
is the incremental bar from the
right, which is building on what
works ... the universal bai from
the left is implementing univer-
sal coverage."
Katherine Baicker, a pro-

fessor of health economics at
Harvard University's School
of Public Health, said reform
should stem from increasingthe
value of what the health care
budget is spent on.
"The states where we spend a
lot of money on health care ben-
eficiaries are the states where
those beneficiaries are least
likely to get mammograms, to
have their eye exams, to get flu
shots," Baicker said. "These are
low cost, high value interven-
tions that aren't being done in
the places we are spending the
most money."
In closing, Leonhardt said
the upcoming presidential elec-
tion will be highly influential
in deciding the future of U.S.
health care reform.
"This is an enormously con-
sequential election, because it is
essentially a referendum on the
most significant piece of social
legislation in 50 years," Leon-

Wolverines to host
Blue/White Game

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Fifth-year senior wide receiver Roy Roundtree and the Michiganfootball team's offense had 23 missed assignments in a 13-6 loss to Notre Dame.
'Unbelievably high' number of
missed assignments plague

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The worst part of film study,
Jordan Kovacs said, is when you
know you messed up. Those glar-
ing missed assignments, when
you should've done one thing
but did the other, and all you can
manage now isto pray thf coach-
es stop the film.
"It's not fun," the fifth-year
senior safety said with a laugh.
"Sometimes you get in those
meetings and you know the play
is coming, and you're thinking
'Oh God, here it comes. Please
don'tshow it, please don't show it.
What is coach goingto say?"'
Against Notre Dame, the
Michigan offense had 23 of those
missed assignments, according
to redshirt junior tackle Tay-
lor Lewan, a number he called
"unbelievably high." The mis-
takes could range from missed
blocks to improper reads to poor
communication.
"You should have one or two
maybe in a game," Lewan said.

"I've never seen (23 missed
assignments) happen before, per-
sonally."
Senior quarterback Denard
Robinson and his five turnovers
have received most of the blame
from Saturday's loss, but the rest
of the offense struggled with
even the smallest of details. Wide
receivers ran past unblocked
linebackers or didn't block at all.
Linemen got beat.
Runners made the wrong
reads. Minus the Hail Mary at the
end of the first half, Robinson was
pressured or hiton all of his.inter-
ceptions.
Lewan said the offense even
failed to communicate the proper
play call. Offensive coordinator
Al Borges called plays on several
occasions that never made it onto
the field.
"It's not just Denard," Lewan
said. "There's plenty of guys who
messed up."
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
calls those missed assignments
"game spasms," his word for
mistakes that never happen in

practice but can derail an offense
during a game. A few happen in
every game, but Michigan tends
to suffer more on the road. Think
Michgian State or Iowa or even
Virginia Tech last year, or Ala-
bama or Notre Dame this year.
When not in Michigan Stadi-
um, the number of missed assign-
ments rises and the Wolverines'
total yardage falls.
This year, Michigan has aver-
aged 504 yards of total offense
per game at home but just 284
yards away from Ann Arbor.
Granted, the level of competition
- Alabama and Notre Dame -
was much higher on road games
this year, but last year's trend was
similar. At home in 2011, Michi-
gan averaged 450 yards. On the
road, the Wolverines averaged
332 yards.
Borges said he used the bye
week to review his own perfor-
mance on the road. He looked at
his play calls from the past two
seasons on the road, every single
call, and evaluated his decisions.
He codified each play into three.

categories. One, where the call
gave an advantage to the offense,
the type of play that should be'
successful; two, where the call
could be successful but required
more execution; and a third
where a call gave the defense the
advantage.
Borges declined to say spe-
cifically what he learned form
his analysis, but the fact that he
reviewed his road play-calling at
all is revealing.
"As a play-caller, believe me,
as hard as the fans are on me,
I'm about eight times harder on
myself," Borges said.
Robinson didn't have an
answer for Michigan's road strug-
gles, and jokingly noted, "I don't
think I had a bad game when I
was at Notre Dame my sopho-
more year," as an understatement..
Lewan said it wouldn't happeni
again. Kovacs blamed a lack of
cohesion.
"It comes down to communi-
cation and just feeling comfort-
able with the guys that you're out
there with," Kovacs said.

The Michigan hockey program
will host its annual Blue/White
Game, featuring several alumni,
at Yost Ice Arena on Sunday. The
scrimmage will feature current
National Hockey League players
Mike Knuble, Jack Johnson, Matt
Hunwick and Andy Hilbert.
The puck is scheduled to drop
at 4:50 p.m.
Michigan NOTEBOOK
coach Red
Berenson said on Tuesday's "Red
Berenson Radio Show" that the
game will be a great opportunity
for fans to catch a first glimpse of
the renovated rink.
This summer, Yost underwent
a major facelift, which most nota-
bly included new windows at
both ends of the arena. The entire
rink is now outfitted with metal
bleachers, and luxury boxes have
been added where the press box
used to sit. The concourses were
also renovated and are now more
spacious.
Johnson, who was the first
alumni guest of the season on
the radio show, said he's excited
to take part in Sunday's scrim-
mage. He's been skating in Ann
Arbor during the NHL's lockout
- Johnson, who has been in the
NHL since 2007, is a member of
the Columbus Blue Jackets.
"It's a great way to stay in
shape," during the NHL lockout,
Johnson said.
HERE COMES THE... DP?: This
_summer, Red Berenson strolled
into a wedding reception to find
a familiar face behind the disc-
jockey booth - junior defense-
man Mac Bennett.
"He's pretty good, so you guys
watch yourselves," Berenson told
the hosts of the radio show, which
- airs weekly on WTKA.
Former Michigan hockey play-
er Danny Fardig chose Bennett to
man the turntables, as he has been

known to do, for his summer wed-
ding.
"I think that's a one-time
thing," Bennett said. "Literally,
I did not sleep for four nights
before the wedding. All I could
think about was that if I mess this
up, everyone's going to know. But
it went well."
Bennett added that the wed-
ding was a perfect match for him
because the bride enjoyed techno
house music - Bennett's special- i
ty.
PRESEASON AWARDS: Tues-
day, the Central Collegiate
Hockey Association released its
preseason all-conference teams,
which included four Michigan
hockey players.
Junior defenseman Jon Merrill
was chosen as the lone Wolver-
ine on the first team. Sophomore
forward Alex Guptill and senior
defensemanheLeecMoffie were
posted to the second team, and
senior forward A.J. Treais was
named an honorable mention.
Merrill earned a preseason
accolade for the second-straight
year, tallying eight first-place
votes and 44 total points amongst
the CCHA's head coaches. The
Brighton, Mich. native notched
seven goals and 18 assists in his
rookie campaign. After missing
the first 22 games last year due
to suspension, Merrill posted 11
points, including four multiple-
point games.
Last season, Guptill accumu-
lated a handful of conference
awards en route tobeing named
CCHA Rookie of the Year. He
tied for the team-high with 16
goals, including five power-play
goals and four game-winners.
In his first three seasons, Mof-
fie registered 61 points, includ-
ing last year's team-high of 25
assists. He was selected for the
All-CCHA Tournamentteam and
received a trio of first-place votes

FOOTBALL
Defense gains confidence
entering Big Ten season

Barnes Arico excited for season

By LUKE PASCH
Daily SportsEditor
Following an underwhelming
2-2 start for the Michigan foot-
ball team this fall, the team's
rhetoric has not changed: The
goal for the season is to win the
Big Ten Championship.
"Why not?" asked fifth-year
senior safety Jordan Kovacs on
Tuesday. "I'm not discouraged
at all by the way things have
started. We're undefeated in the
Big Ten right now, right? Aren't
we undefeated?"
Reporters w chuckled. The
Wolverines are the only team
in the Legends division of the
Big Ten to not play a conference
opponent. So, yes - they have
statistically as good a chance of
winning the Big Ten title as any
other team.
"That's what I thought,"
Kovacs said.
That glass-half-full mental-
ity was apparent from most of
the personnel that spoke with
the media on Tuesday, espe-
cially from the defensive play-
ers. Even defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison, who is never sat-
isfied with his defense's perfor-
mance, seemed proud of how his
unit played against Notre Dame
before the bye week.
To be clear, no Wolverine left
South Bend two Saturdays ago
feeling content with the 13-6
loss to the Fighting Irish. But
Mattison still recognizes good
defense when he sees it. The
offense turned the ball over six
times at Notre Dame Stadium,
and his players still surrendered
just 13 points. That's impressive,
regardless of the outcome.
"Well, I'm encouraged that it

Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico stood
in the William Davidson Player
Development Center with a smile
splashed across her face, stand-
ing relaxed and waiting to begin
practice.
You didn't need to see her
demeanor, though, you could hear
her excitement in her voice.
"We're all extremely excited
to be here, from the staff to the
players down, to the support
staff," Barnes Arico said. "I think
the culture that we're creating is
extremely exciting. Everybody
wants to be a part of it and get
started."
Though just two days of offi-
cial practice have passed, Barnes
Arico's upbeat personality has
already carried over to the court.
Barnes Arico enters her first
season as head coach at Michi-
gan, replacing former coach
Kevin Borseth. Before coming to
Ann Arbor in April, she capped
her 10-year tenure at St. John's
with three-consecutive NCAA
Tournament berths. In her final
season at the helm of the Red
Storm, she guided the team to the
Sweet 16.
While her expectations are
high for her new program, Barnes
Arico said she isn't focused on
buildingoff of last season - Mich-
igan's first NCAA Tournament
appearance in 11 years, which
ended with a loss to Oklahoma
in the first round. Instead, she is
building an entirely new founda-
tion for the 40-year-old program.
"Ithinkoneofthebigthings for
me is not to compare it to things
they've had in past," Barnes Arico
said. "It's a new time for them as
players, it's a new time for our
program and it's a challenge for
me."
Michigan returns 11 years
this year, including five seniors.
Among them is senior center
Rachel Scheffer, the team's lead-
ing scorer in 2011-2012.

Known for running a fast-
paced offense and a strong
defense, Barnes Arico was also
clear abouther plans for the 2012-
2013 squad.
"We would like to get up and
down (the.court) - we would like
to be the best-conditioned team
in the country as well as the team
that works the hardest," Barnes
Arico said. "That's what we're
really stressing early on - just
going hard in everything you do."
Barnes Arico has also had 'to
adjust to life off the court in Ann
Arbor with her husband and three
children.
From coaching clinics to speak-
ing at the student watch party at
Michigan Stadium before Michi-
gan football's season opener, she
has quickly immersed herself in
the city and the University com-
munity.
"I would have only left (St.
John's) for something incredibly
special - and that is Michigan,"
Barnes Arico said. "It's an incred-
ible place. Everything about the
place - from the facilities to the
academic reputation, the nation-
al reputation, the resources, but
even the entire community.

after completingher first, the New
York City Marathon, last year.
Her goals also extend beyond the
court as well, as Barnes Arico said
she hopes to enhance the reputa-
tion of Michigan women's basket-
ball inthe community.
"I think the number one thing
is for the community to feel con-
nected," she said. "They need to
feel a relationship with us and I
think it's partof my job is to go out
and build that relationship. (We
want to) promote the program
and what these young ladies stand
for and how much they work and
how we're building a champion-
ship year for the women's basket-
ball program."
If the animated Barnes Arico
has one setback in her outstand-
ing career, it may be working late
into the night.
"I'm just a high-energy per-
son," Barnes Arico said. "Unless
you catch me after nine, then I'm
not really high energy. That's a bit
of a problem."
Someone should warn her
about the 13 night games she plays
this season, then.

What do flying, marriage and Greek Life
have in common?

By Zach Bergson and Terra Molengraff

Name: Leslie Weisz
Age: 20
Hometown: Plymouth, Mich.
School and Year: LSA senior
Concentration: Biological Physics
Where do you like to hang out in Ann Arbor?
I spend most of my time on South U. But, I'm an outdoors-
y person so I like going to the Arb. I'll go rock climbing
every now and then. I play a lot of video games at my
house, but that's not really hanging out in Ann Arbor.
What kind of video games do you play?
"Call of Duty," it's my favorite. I'm still hooked to "Black
Ops," though everyone else has moved on. But I love "Call
of Duty." It's really corny; don't tell anyone.
Where do you live?
Greenwood. So yeah, that kind of defines me.
Are your shoes up on the wires on Greenwood?
No, I haven't had to put shoes up there yet. The rule is if
you ever party on Greenwood and you pass out, they'll take
off your shoes and throw them up there, so thankfully,
mine aren't up there.
You're in a sorority (Sigma Kappa), you played on the
varsity women's soccer team your freshman year and
you're a part of Air Force ROTC. How did you balance
all of these things with school?
I'm not even sure, looking back on it. It's a lot of planning.
I'm a listmaker, probably too excessively. Also, I'm a nine
to 10 hour sleeper. If I don't get that much sleep, my days
don't really work. It's all about efficiency. If I have to get
9 something done, I have to get it done, or there's no way I'll
ever get anything done.
What are you going to do in the Air Force after you
graduate?
When you're a senior, you put in a job application to the Air
Force. They evaluate thembased upon physical fitness, GPA,
how well you did when you went to boot camp. If you did

well on all of those things, you're going to get a job you want.
There are also specific jobs - the sexy jobs, like pilot or navi-
gator - that are separate and you have to apply to them. Last
year, I applied to be a pilot and got selected. I made it through
all of the security clearances and my flight physical. In May,
I'll be headed to flight training and that will be my job.
Do you have a specific plane that you want to fly?
I would love to fly an F-16, but it's hard to get those.
There's not a lot of positions and it's a very competitive
career field. I want to be a fighter, though, not a bomber.
But that B-52 flyover at the football game was pretty cool.
Do you know what you want to do after the Air Force,
or is that not on the radar yet?
The problem is that when you're in a normal ROTC pro-
gram, you only owe the Air Force four years of duty. But
as a pilot, since it costs so much time and money to train
someone, they up it to 10 years. It's a give and take. Going
into the career field of a pilot, I get to be a pilot, which is
awesome, but now I owe the Air Force 10 years of service.
You have been involved with three very distinct
groups on campus. What was it like to interacting
with such different organizations?
ROTC and the military are significantly different than the
girls in Sigma Kappa. To be honest, you have to be open
to new people and new ideas and new ways of thinking.
The way that the girls in my sorority lived their lives are
completely different from me. I.don't want to say that I
was an anomaly in our sorority, but as clich6 as it sounds,
they're wearing their Ugg boots and their tights, but that's
not who I am, but it's who they are. You have to take each
person for their personality and be open to who they are
instead of what they wear or who they hang out with.
I see a shiny diamond ring on your finger ... are you
engaged?
Yes! I met him in the Air Force duringtraining back in fresh-
man year. He goes to Penn State, so we don't like him very
much. We dated for about a year and a half, and he wants to
be a pilot too so we got engaged (couples in the military can
only be together if they join while they're married). We've
been together for almost three years now.

Regarding: "/ am a first-generation college student"
Terra I just want to say thanks and wow!I am a Michigan graduate from
way back in 1986. I was also a summer bridge student in the summer of
1980.
I remember watching the Empire Strikes Back at the campus theater,
dancing in the Michigan Union Club under the summer stars and experi-
encing life away from home with my fellow bridge students.
How funny that!I now work for Lucasfilm. It was just a dream back then
but I've learned that dreams come true...with hard work.
I understand where you are now and what you still have to go through. I
would like to offer some wisdom from an older person.
I understand the less than utopian experience of being the first in the
family to attend college. There are real pressures from all sides. Trust your-
self. Trust your dreams. In the eod it's your choices that will define your
desired reality not others expectations. Michigan is not paradise but it is a
great micro universe where you can explore, observe, grow...and have fun.
Go Blue and thank you!

P.S. I lived in MoJo too. Great dorm!

Welcome to the Random Stu-
dent Interview, where our
hopes and dreams haven't been
crushed by an overwhelming
sense of self-doubt ... yet.
So, the semester's getting
underway. You're a freshman.
Feeling the stress yet?
Oh yeah, little bit.
What's that stress feel like? Give
me a descriptor.
'A descriptor of stress? Like, I'm
always feeling busy... I don't know.
Describing stress, that's a tough one.
Is it crushing? Are you strug-
gling to stand up straight under
the weight?
It's not crushing. I'd say it's
stretching.
Stretching. That's a good one.
I was just wondering because
mine's more like a crushing sen-
sation. I'm a senior so things are
just piling up. You're a freshman
so you must feel like you have
everything figured out.
Oh yeah. I've got a system worked
out now so it's not so bad. I mean,
I'm only taking 13 credits.
Oh, you did it right! Who gave
you that great advice?
An Engineering advising person.
OK, good. So, let's take this oppor-
tunity youhave with anonymity
inthis interviewtounload some
of the things onyour mind. This

could be a mini therapy session.
So vent to me.Is your roommate
doing anything annoying?
No. My roommate's pretty cool.
And venting? There's nothing for
me to vent about right now. I don't
know. I love it here so far.
You're just living a great life.
The sun is shining because Matt
tells it to shine.
Yeah, I'm just having a great time.
I'm very happy.
Get back to me on that in four
years.
(Laughs)
So where are you headed to
know to spread your happiness?
Back to West Quad to chill out.
Maybe eat something.
How about that burrito bar?
I've actually never tried it.
Seriously? If you think you're
life is good now, wait until you
stuff your face with a personal-
ized burrito.
I know. I just don't want to be dis-
appointed.
Because
you have
Ssuch high
hopes?
Â« I'm from
California so
we have very good Mexican food.
Did you know that the burrito is
not Mexican?
No. I didn't know that.
Apparently it's not from Mex-
ico. I read it somewhere so it
must be true.
Oh, OK.

It's fast food Mexican.
It's notMexican. We just went
over this.
It's a step up from Taco Bell.
Wait. Let me get
this straight. I
just realized
that you're
- happy here even
though you're from California.
Yeah. I mean the weather hasn't
gotten bad yet, but...
You are just too optimistic for
me. I take back what I said
about coming back to talk to me
in four years. Come back and
talk to me after the first snow-
fall.
Yeah, well, I'm planning on mov-
ing back there once I'm done with
undergrad.
OK, so this is temporarily
endurable.
Yeah. It's like going on an adven-
ture for four years.

that you can't get out of and

don't want to get married.
I've been telling people this since I was about 12,
though the thought was in the back of my mind before
then.
Whenever I tell people I don't want to get married, I'm
met with one of two responses: They either react as if I've
just informed them that I have a nuclear bomb in my purse or
they laugh and say I'll change my mind.
Though I could talk about heterosexist institutions and
the nuclear family for days, my not wanting to get married
isn't some kind of feminist endgame. For me, my stance on
marriage isn't any different from the fact that I don't want
to get a tattoo or live in Texas or become an investment
banker.
Though my mother brings up the 'm' word from time to
time (those times have come up more frequently since she
started watching "Downtown Abbey"), most people who
are not the Dowager Countess would probably agree that
I'm a bit voung for all this sedding talk, so let's put that
issue aside for now and focus on something more relevant:

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND
I don't want to be good at dating. I used to join in with my
self-berating single friends and lament over failed attempts
at relationships. After all, years of watching too much TV
had taught me I'm supposed to long for a life of romance. It
took me a while to realize that most of my social ineptitude
has a clear cause: I'm bad at dating because I don't want to
date.
Because I've never cried during a movie, many of my
friends call me a robot. The guy I took to senior prom told
me that I'm cold and distant. My go-to piece of advice for
any friends who are fighting with their significant other
is: "You're probably better off without him/her." One
time, I attempted to have a heartfelt discussion about
relationships with a friend of mine over Facebook chat.
I ended up quoting - verbatim - a Joey monologue from
season two of "Dawson's Creek" just for laughs. He never
noticed.
Dating is just not something I want, or need, right now. I
am content with my single lady status. I'm perplexed bcon
c's ts as simple as holding ha.ris and cuddling. Those a.:
things I want, and unfortunateI that snot somethmn p'os
are uii!to eccept. I've had people accuse me of bemj <' il,.

damaged, insensitive. Yes, I'm afraid of commitment, but I
also don't want the most commonly accepted incarnations of
love and romance.
So back to that whole marriage hoopla. The only thing
less appealing to me than marriage is a tattoo. My attitude
toward dating is something I see as temporary and mostly
circumstantial, but marriage hasn't ever sounded like some-
thing I want.
As it turns out, my unwillingness to settle or compro-
mise is becoming an increasingly popular trend. New York
University sociologist Eric Klinenberg conducted a study
of adults who choose to stay single and published the book
"Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal
of Living Alone." Spoiler alert: They're not all selfish, heart-
less monsters. And I'm not destined to end up a bitter woman
with 17 cats or an uptight bitch married to her career (though

LEADERS

child.

in flux of posts from U of M on Asian-
ssleepinginthelibrary.tumblr.com.

Breitenbach also emphasized that
committed relationships tack on yet
another responsibility to the already
overextended schedule of a typical col-
lege student.
"Relationships are quite mentally
straining, and when you're trying to grad-
uate, especially from Michigan, you have
all these kind of other stresses - you have
to get a good GPA, you have to do all this
extra work - you kind of want to die some-
times," she said.
The preponderance of the double
standard
Despite the advancements young
women have made toward sexual empow-
erment, Aubrey argues that "old-fashioned
patriarchy" has continued to prevail in a
culture largely based on sexual objectifica-
tion.
According to Aubrey, in a party context
women are more likely to be evaluated by
their appearances than men, whereas men
are more likely to be evaluated on other
attributes: resources, access, social con-
nections or financial means.
While out at a bar one night, Cronin said
she was approached by a man who groped
her breasts. Clearly violated, she inquired
what possessed him to engage in such an
inappropriate manner.
"He was like 'Well, didn't you want
me to? That's why you were wearing that
shirt,' " she recalled. "That's the kind of
stuff that I hate."
In a study, Aubrey analyzed televi-
sion shows to see how sexual experiences
and their consequences were distributed
among females and males. She found that
female characters received negative pen-
alties for their behaviors more often than

males.
"Hooking up is portrayed in a less con-
flicting way for men than it is for-women,"
Aubrey said. "Women are definitely shown
hooking up, but there is a variation on the
emotional outcome of that for women ver-
sus men."
But despite the enduring stereotype
that females have an inherent tendency to
develop feelings in the wake of a hookup,
Breitenbach said she more often experi-
ences the opposite.
She cited a former relationship attempt
as evidence.
"He was totally gung-ho about it, and
then I was like, 'Oh, I'm not interested
in you at all,' " she said. "He wanted to
take it from being hook-up buddies to
being a relationship, and I was just not
into it."
Til death do us part?
But what about marriage? Is this cul-
ture - marked by the conflict between the
physical and the emotional - just a titil-
lating means of keeping marriage on the
backburner? Or is the institution slowly
becoming obsolete?
In a study from the Pew Research
Center, 39 percent of Gen Yers claimed
they believed marriage had become an
archaic practice. Only 30 percent consid-
er marriage to be a top priority in their
lives.
Additionally, data shows 22 percent
of individuals ages 19 to 29 are married.
This number is down from 29 percent in
1997.
In her November 2011 Atlantic piece
"All The Single Ladies," Kate Bolick
paints a portrait of the American wom-
an's undulating perspectives on mar-

riage, amplified in the wake of vast
economic gains.
"As women have climbed ever higher,
men have been falling behind," she writes
in the article. "We've arrived at the top
of the staircase, finally ready to start our
lives, only to discover a cavernous room
at the tail end of a party, most of the men
gone already, some having never shown
up - and those who remain are leering
by the cheese table, or are, you know, the
ones you don't want to go out with."
LSA senior Charlotte Myers's experi-
ence growingup as the daughter of a single,
working mother struggling to raise three
children has made her skeptical toward
wedlock.
"I just want to do things for myself,"
Myers said. "If things work out that I get
married or have kids or something, then
that's fine too. But it's not in my plan for
life."
LSA senior Erin Reed, whose father
walked out on her when she was three
months old, said she would like to get
married someday, but is doubtful of the
ability to find a partner who will fully
commit.
"I definitely think that I'm more cau-
tious in that situation and in the qualities
that I would need to see in another per-
son," Reed said. "My number one is com-
mitment."
Despite contradictory feelings toward
marriage and mounting skepticism toward
monogamous institutions, many students
haven't completely foregone the desire to
tie the knot.
"There's a big part of me that's like,
'OK, marriage is this antiquated ritual.'
But then there's the part of me that's
grown up in America, that looks at my
parents' wedding photos and their fabu-

lous wedding, and thinks, 'Man, I really
do want that really beautiful white dress,'
" Cohen, the woman in the open relation-
ship, said.
"Being in an open
relationship is just
great. You have all of the
security and the support
and the love that you
have in a traditional,
monogamous
relationship. But you
also have the freedom to
go out on Friday night
with your friends, and if
you end up making out
with some frat guy, you
don't have to break up
over it."
-Music, Theatre & Dance Senior
Laura Cohen
Cronin, the woman who describes her-
self as "in-between," said she also antici-
pates marrying someday.
"I think eventually I'd like to get mar-
ried," Cronin said with a smile. "Probably
when I'm, like, 40, though. Because I've
got to get my career going first."

The morning after: A portrait of the University's hook-up cu

Iture


By Bethany Biron


Curled comfortably beneath a red wool blanket, LSA
senior Michelle Cronin glances quizzically at her house-
mates lounging in the dimly lit living room of Owen
House, a co-op on Oakland Street.
"You're pretty in-between," Emilia Breitenbach, a recent
University alum, says after thoughtful consideration. "Your
mindset is in-between, definitely."
Cronin ruminates a moment longer, drawing the blan-
ket closer to herbody and fidgeting with the frayed threads
unraveling along the edges.
"I don't like hook-up culture, but I have gotten into some
random situations and always felt really weird afterwards,"
she says.
"You kind of have that guilt complex afterward," Breiten-
bach adds. "Where it's, like, 'Oh, this isn't right,' and you're
more looking for a serious person. But in-between, you're still
dipping into it.
"Whereas for me, I'm just straight up random hookups."
Breitenbach pauses. "I don't want to worry about it."
As they sit and mull over their experiences, Cronin
and Breitenbach find themselves trapped in an ideologi-
cal contradiction that plagues young twenty-something
women in the modern era. It's no longer enough to go to
college, find a boyfriend and get married. The priorities
have shifted.
As today's women navigate the tumultuous path between
romance and career, they've increasingly turned toward
"hook-up culture" as a means of escape. An arduous week

of academia paves way to the sweet freedom of Friday night,
and the streets swell with a cavalcade of stilettos propping up
scantily clad girls with berry-colored lips and black-rimmed
eyes.
With bags slung haphazardly across their shoulders, they
sip on gin and tonics between shots of Absolut before stum-
bling to the dance floor where their lips magnetically meet
with a stranger's, heads ultimately hitting the pillow in that
same stranger's bed.
The proliferation of hook-up culture - promulgated by the
sexual revolution of the 1960s, advancements in the women's
movement and the advent of birth control - has fostered a
generation that waltzes precariously atop a delicate thread of
empowerment and objectification, wavering between endors-
ing and rejecting a culture that shies away from traditional
notions of monogamy.
The transformation of the modern relationship
After trying her hand at monogamy with her first "real"
boyfriend during her freshman and sophomore years at the
University, Music, Theatre & Dance senior Laura Cohen
decided commitment ultimately wasn't for her.
"It was a big learning experience," she said. "It definite-
ly showed me that I have very little interest in monogamy
... I don't really think that it's something I care about in
my life."
Instead, she opted for an open relationship, establishing

a mutual understanding between herself and her partner
that outside hookups were allowed, even encouraged.
"Being inan open relationship is just great," Cohen said.
"You have all of the security and the support and the love that
you have in a traditional, monogamous relationship.-But you
also have the freedom to go out on Friday night with your
friends, and if you end up making out with some frat guy, you
don't have to break up over it."
As defined by Elizabeth Marquardt, the director of the
Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for Ameri-
can Values in New York City, and the late University of Texas
sociologist Norval Glenn, a hookup is "anything ranging from
'hooking up to having sex.' "An unbreakable criterion is that
it must take place outside the context of commitment.
Engineering senior Stephen Barnard met a girl at a party
last summer for whom he quickly developed sexual feelings.
They started regularly hooking up.
But as their sexual escapades persisted, they felt compelled
to take a stab at being in a relationship. They started doing
"coupley things," as Barnard put it - but their attempt fal-
tered shortly after.
"I was sort of pushing things forward artificially without
either of us really being into it, sort of out of obligation," Bar-
nard said. "Then it all sort of broke down, and we admitted
that we were just fuck buddies."
In 2004, Elizabeth Armstrong, an associate professor of
Women's Studies, conducted a study of the romantic lives of
53 female students at a dorm known for its propensity for par-

tying at a Midwestern state school.
She was surprised to discover how many subjects
expressed a desire to experiment with the concept of "friends
with benefits."
Armstrong cited one young woman who developed a con-
tract that defined the parameters of her and her partner's
relationship. This contract, the young woman stated, was
developed out of concern that the partner might develop feel-
ings for her.
Determined via text message and instant messenger,
the ground rules of the contract defined which sexual
acts would be allowed and which forms of birth control
were permitted. It set stipulations on spending time
together outside of the bedroom to prevent any roman-
tic sentiments that could have arisen over morning-after
pancakes.
Breitenbach, sitting at Owen House, said she agreed with
the woman in the study, saying her experiences with hook-
ing up in college had largely been focused on meeting car-
nal desires rather than facilitating meaningful and fulfilling
interactions.
"I've more just been kind of free-spirited about it, more
dealing with physical needs instead of emotional needs," she
said.
Similarly for Cohen, the woman in the open relationship,
sex became more of a biological urge than an emotionally
laden interaction, and served as a means for establishing
independence.,
