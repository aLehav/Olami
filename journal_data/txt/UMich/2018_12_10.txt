At 
the 
intersection 
of 

Washtenaw Avenue and Hill 
Street, where the University 
of Michigan’s iconic painted 
Rock resides, residents have 
reported many dangerous car 
accidents that put drivers and 
pedestrians at risk.

Michigan 
Traffic 
Crash 

Facts, a tool developed by the 
University, compiles queries 
of 
accident 
information 

across the state of Michigan. 
According to MTCF, there 
were 245 crashes within 150 
feet of the intersection of 
Washtenaw and Hill from 
2008 to 2017, and 41 of those 
crashes were in 2017 alone. In 
fact, the number of crashes 
almost doubled from 2016 to 
2017 with 25 crashes reported 
in 2016. Information about 
2018 has yet to be synthesized.
Residents suspect the high 
frequency of accidents can be 
attributed to the sloping road, 
illegal left turns and the high 
speed limit –– 45 miles per 
hour.

Holde Dorcherts, a retired 

University 
of 
Michigan 

library researcher, has lived in 
a house at this intersection for 
the last 39 years. She claims 
accidents 
have 
increased 

since she and her husband 
have moved into the house.

“I’m saying that for the 

last 39 years, Ann Arbor 
has increased in size. It’s 

becoming a city instead of a 
cute little town, and we have 
enormous traffic coming into 
town –– thousands of cars,” 
she said. “This intersection is 
poorly designed. It was fine 
50 to 100 years ago, but now 
it is a major server into town. 
Because of this increase in 
population and traffic we 
have a lot more accidents 
here, but the intersection 
design has not changed.”

Dorcherts said it is not an 

uncommon 
occurrence 
to 

hear an accident across the 
street shortly followed by the 
sirens of an ambulance. 

“We built over the years a 

pretty solid hedge, and that 
hedge takes so much abuse 
at that corner,” she said. “It 
doesn’t matter what we plant, 
it gets demolished from cars.”

A similar event happened 

to resident Chad Brummett, 
a professor of anesthesiology 
at the Medical School, when 

his iron-rod fence was split in 
half by an automobile accident 
a few weeks ago. Brummett 
said he was shocked by the 
sheer force needed to dent the 
fence, let alone break it.

“We’ve lived in this house 

for almost nine years. We see 
accidents there all the time,” 
Brummett said. 

When the new University of 

Michigan’s 
Board 
of 
Regents 

convenes in 2019, it will have seven 
Democrats and just one Republican, 
the result of two new Democratic 
members, Jordan Acker and Paul 
Brown, replacing two current 
Republican 
members, 
Andrew 

Richner 
and 
Andrea 
Fischer 

Newman. This will shift the 
ideological balance of the board 
to the furthest left it has been in 
several decades.

The board has been comprised 

of eight officials elected statewide 
since 
1852. 
Members 
were 

initially mostly nonpartisan but 
increasingly identified with one 
of the major political parties. By 
the early 20th century, nearly all 
members of the board had political 
affiliations. Since this period, such 
partisan dominance that will be 
present next year has rarely been 
seen.

There were several brief periods 

of Republican dominance, but 
since the emergence of the modern 
party system, there have been only 
two such periods, from 1967 to 1968 
and from 1975 to 1984, both marked

The University of Michigan hired 

Stephen Shipps as an associate 
professor of music on Sept. 1, 1989. 
Since then, he has had a successful 
academic career at the University. 
From 2001 to 2004, he served on 
the Executive Committee of the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance. 
From 2002 to 2007, he served as 
the associate dean for academic 
affairs. He is currently the chair of 
strings and the faculty director of 
the Strings Preparatory Academy, 

a university-affiliated pre-college 
music program for local middle and 
high school students.

A Michigan Daily investigation 

unearthed previously undisclosed 
allegations of sexual harassment and 
sexual misconduct against Shipps. 
These reports span nearly 40 years, 
from Fall 1978 to a University-
affiliated 
summer 
program 
in 

the last five years. They include 
accusations of unwanted touching, 
sexual assault, prolonged sexual 
relationships with teenage students, 
and misogynistic and sexist verbal 
statements.

Shipps declined to comment for 

this article. His lawyer, David Nacht, 
also declined to comment.

The Daily also found reports that 

at least one faculty member in the 
Music, Theatre & Dance school, Prof. 
Yizhak Schotten, was made aware 
of some of these allegations soon 
after Shipps’s hiring was announced 
and before he started teaching. It is 
unclear whether he communicated 
these concerns to the University at 
the time, or if the University has ever 
been made aware of these concerns.

***
Shipps taught at the University of 

North Carolina School of the Arts — 
known then as the North Carolina 

School of the Arts before a 2008 
name change — prior to coming to 
the University of Michigan. The 
Daily spoke with a former North 
Carolina School of the Arts college 
student, who wished to remain 
anonymous, citing professional and 
privacy 
concerns. 
She 
currently 

serves as the associate principal 
second (the second-ranked member 
of the second violin section) in a 
full-time professional orchestra. In 
this article, she will be referred to as 
Meghan.

neuroscience,” Booth said in a 
university press release.

LSA 
senior 
Camille 

Phaneuf, 
co-president 
of 

the 
Neuroscience 
Student 

Association, 
chose 
her 

major because much about the 
brain is yet to be uncovered, 
and is excited about the new 
program.

“I 
decided 
to 
study 

neuroscience because the brain 
is a gelatinous blob that semi-
floats between our ears, yet it 

somehow manages 
to 

control our every thought, 
action and emotion,” Phaneuf 
said. “Despite all of humans’ 
powerful 
metacognitive 

abilities, 
we 
actually 

understand so little about 
the organ that makes these 
capacities possible.”

In order to complete the 

University’s new certificate, 
students must finish nine 
graduate 
credit 
hours 

in 
approved 
core 
and 

interdisciplinary 
courses, 

by 7 to 1 Democratic dominance. 
However, the board has had an 
almost uninterrupted Democratic 
majority since the 1950s.

Despite 
this 
consistent 

ideological presence, the board’s 
work is largely nonpartisan and 
focuses on various challenges 
facing 
the 
University 
rather 

than ideologically acrimonious 
issues. According to University 
Regent Ron Weiser (R), the 
board’s working style is mostly 
harmonious and united.

“The board is not ideological 

in nature; at least that’s what I’ve 
found up to now,” Weiser said. “I 
believe everyone there is looking 
at a focus on the University and 
what’s best for it and the students 
at the University, for its long-term 
future. And I don’t think that 
partisan politics are at play; at 
least I have not experienced that 
in my two years.”

Weiser, who was first elected in 

2016, will be the chair of the board 
and the board’s only Republican. 
He has established productive 
individual working relationships 
with the current members of the 
board and doesn’t see partisan 
obstacles in the future.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
who 
sits 
on 
the 

board as a non-voting member, 
echoed 
these 
comments 
in 

an interview with The Michigan 
Daily earlier this month.

“Rarely do partisan issues 

show up in discussions by the 
board,” Schlissel said. “They’re 
responsible for supervising me 
and then general oversight of the 
University, and there are way 
more similarities than there are 
differences between the members 
of different parties … With two 
new people (Acker and Brown), 
that’s a quarter of the group that’s 
different, so there’s a whole new 
dynamic. And people come in 
with their own background and 
the issues they care about … but I 
wouldn’t parse those things into 
Democrat or Republican.”

Though the work on the board 

is 
supposedly 
non-partisan, 

Public Policy junior Katie Kelly, 
the communications director of 
the University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said she still sees value 
in the partisan elections. She said 
party identification signals that 
candidates hold certain views on 
governance.

“It shows the real values that 

that person has,” Kelly said. “With 
the extreme divides that have 
come between the Democratic 
and Republican parties, it has 
become easier to see what a 
politician values based on their 
party. So for us in College Dems 
— we knew that Jordan Acker 
and Paul Brown shared the same 
values as us.”

The College Democrats spent 

time working with Brown and 
Acker, who attended several 
meetings of the organization 
this semester as well as their 
“election eve” party. Kelly said the 
College Democrats considered 
this midterm to be especially 
important, 
and 
members 

emphasized the importance 
of down-ballot elections, 
such as those for the 
Board of Regents, in their 
advocacy. They focused on 
the Board of Regents more 
than 
other 
down-ballot 

elections because of how 
directly 
the 
candidates 

affect 
the 
lives 
and 

educations of University 
students.

The University’s chapter of 

College Republicans similarly 
campaigned for Richner and 
Newman. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Dylan Berger, president of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, said the College 
Republicans 
supported 
the 

candidates 
because 
of 
their 

specific policy positions.

“We supported both (Richner 

and Newman) because they 
supported fiscal responsibility 
and free speech on campus, not 
because of their party affiliation,” 
Berger 
wrote 
in 
an 
email 

interview. “Going forward, we 
are committed to working with 
all Regents, regardless of political 
affiliation, to advance freedom of 
speech on campus.”

Where the regents do differ, 

the differences tend to be more 
pronounced in what policy issues 
they focus on rather than their 
place on the partisan spectrum. 
Nonetheless, Weiser expressed 
firm confidence in the capability 
of the board to work effectively in 
the future.

“I don’t see anything that’s 

going to change based on the 
things that we’re working on, 
which are really about what’s 
best for our customers, which are 
the students, and for our faculty, 
staff, and for the University’s 
future,” Weiser said. “We have a 
responsibility of general oversight 
— especially financial oversight — 
and I think that doesn’t change.”

The Marshall Scholarship provides up to 50 students from across the United

 48 scholars were chosen from a pool of 

 1,000 applicants.

collected from storm sewers in Ann

exposure to large amounts of

liver damage, as well as respiratory 
issues, the state lowered the 
acceptable amount of the toxin from

Hello! 
In 
a 
staggering 

demonstration of self-flagellation, I 
wanted to go over my college essay 
I used to apply to the University of 
Michigan. Maybe this could be a 
nice send off for myself.

Before we start — who was 

17-year-old Nisa Khan? She was an 
insecure thing — not much different 
from 
the 
soon-to-be 
college 

graduate (Inshallah!!) she is now — 
but she was a little sad.

I will not dive so deeply as to 

why — I am not quite certain that 
I remember — but I know that I 
felt very disconnected with the 
community around me. I could not 
relate with Americans. I could not 
relate with desis. I did not feel like 
the University was my home. It was 
just another pit stop in the series of 
places my family moved to.

Let’s get started. Fair warning, 

she wasn’t a fantastic writer.

Bold are the comments from 

present day me.

I 
was 
born 
in 
Hershey, 

Pennsylvania. I moved from the US 
to Saudi Arabia, then to Pakistan, 
then to Qatar, then to Maryland, 
and finally to Michigan. When I 
relay this in conversations, I get 
a variety of replies: “Why do you 
move so much?” to “That must have 
been hard.” I relate to the latter one 
the most. Already she’s getting 
dramatic!! I love it.

The small town of Hershey was 

the center of my world for eight 
years.

(From what I remember, it 

felt like such a bright first few 
years. It’s a bizarre place, very, 
very small-town-like that also 
has huge tourist attractions. 
We lived near the amusement 
park 
and 
I 
still 
remember 

our vacations in the summer, 
Halloween, Christmas — the four 
of us walking through the park’s 
carnival-like existence, with the 
neon lights and pure joy from 
everyone around us.)

A wild Pennsylvanian youth shows 

her mother the reaps of her hunt.

My family ate Chinese on 

Christmas because it was the 
only place open. I had a name that 
made substitute teachers cringe 
as they came across it. (If I can be 
completely honest, there is a good 
chance that I am pronouncing 
my old name incorrectly due to 

my accent. Fun facts: The oldest 
root that I personally know of 
was that it was the last wife of the 
Mughal emperor Jahangir— she 
went by Nur Jahan but her real 
name was Mehr-un-Nissa. She 
even died in Lahore, which is my 
family’s home town.

However, I don’t think my 

parents knew this. My dad claims 
it’s from an old female family 
member— Khair-un-Nisa. My 
mom claims it was from my dad’s 
ex-girlfriend.)

(Nisa (rhymes with Lisa), for 

the record, was a name born out 
of my sister’s mispronunciation 
of my name. The true “Nisa” 
sound in Mehrunisa is more like 
“Nyssa.”)

I always hailed these as making 

me a unique individual. Bad 
grammar. Yet, while I was proud 
that I could dress up as a pretty 
mean Hermione Granger due to 
my unruly hair (I still make a 
great Hermione, but oh Nisa, you 
would not imagine how much 
JKR would let you down.), I was 
also rather ignorant of my culture, 
or my parent’s culture. My mother, 
father, and both sides of the family 
— everyone, really — would beg me 
to speak Urdu. But I was insistent 
that it was ultimately useless. The 
pride! The assimilation! Drag 
her! Ignoring my serious threats 
of chaining myself to the house, 
my parents moved us to Lahore, 
Pakistan, after the death of my 
grandmother. My swashbuckling 
confidence would soon come to a 
sudden halt.

My most piercing memory in 

Lahore occurred when I was in my 
fifth grade classroom. My hands 
were clenched to the stair railing 
as I listened to the bombs going off 
in the distance. My legs were weak 
and my heart was lodged in my 
throat. We hid in the classroom’s 
closet 
where 
I 
lamented 
my 

parents’ decision to move me here. 
I did not fit in this strange country 
with its spicy food and people who 
laughed at my lack of knowledge 
concerning my culture; the latter 
filled me with shame. I could never 
imagine myself getting used to this 
way of life where explosions were 
commonplace. I missed Hershey, 
where the chocolate smell wafted in 
the peaceful air.

But then, with my time spent in 

my new home, with my classmates, 
and with my extended family, I 
came to appreciate the Pakistani 
lifestyle: its clothes, food, and 
language. I could finally carry on 
a conversation in Urdu, although 
with an extended “A” sound that I 
struggled with due to my American 
accent. Still have it. I no longer 
felt the need to hide from my 
background because I was where 
the background was accepted. I 
wanted to join in with my cousins 
and the kids at school. I wanted to 
assume a greater identity. After 
only a year, I was far more adjusted 
than my father. He would be scared 
to send us to our school after bomb 
threats but eleven-year-old Nisa 
would assure him we couldn’t live 
in fear.

Three 
year 
later, 
I 
visited 

Hershey. This magical little town 
— the sweetest place on Earth — 
seemed like it was just any other 
suburban town. The city seemed to 
have lost its whimsy.

In reality, the town did not 

change; I just grew up. I knew a 
life outside Hershey and childhood 
nostalgia no longer had as firm of a 
grasp. If we had stayed in Hershey, 
I would have never truly embraced 
my Pakistani culture. Some people 
do not have to leave home for that 
experience, but I did.

This is actually a lot more 

honest than I remember it being. 
But it is, of course, not always so 
simple.

Perhaps a part of me still has 

that bit of resentment for Lahore 
from my experience — a part of 
me that still remembers those 
few, horrible days. A part of me 
still scared for my sister, my 
extended-family, even though I 
am so, so lucky to live in a city and 
country that is mostly stable and 
that my loved-ones are safe. And 
sometimes I feel ashamed about 
it. Because I do love Lahore.

I think coming back to the 

United States has made me more 
attached to my Pakistani identity. 
Coming back to this country did 
not feel like a homecoming — it 
felt even more alienating than 
the international schools I went 
to growing up. I became a quieter 
person — a stark contrast to that 
bright, bubbly girl from Hershey.

My first day back in an 

American school, a girl asked 
me if I knew how to put together 
to bomb. If I knew Osama Bin 
Laden. I smiled tightly and said, 
“Please don’t joke about that.” 

And 
her 
smile 
disappeared, 

shaken at my sudden change in 
demeanor. (And she was 14 — and 
14 year olds can say dumb things. 
I don’t hold it against her. I barely 
remember her name.)

I think it makes sense — when 

you are in the States and you 
feel alone, you want something 
to call your own. To grab on 
and say, “Hey, this is me. I look 
like them, my name sounds like 
theirs.” I think this, and my own 
expansion of what social justice 
was, gave me this boost to be like: 
Yeah, I am Pakistani-American.

It taught me the value of 

communicating and connecting, 
to be more open to our world. Yes, 
moving around was hard, but my 
eyes were opened to the world with 
all its challenges and possibilities.

And going to the University of 

Michigan helped.

It’s been the longest I have 

stayed in one place. My parents 
feel at ease in this state. And, 
because of The Daily, I find myself 
weirdly passionate about the 
culture and politics of this state. 
Because of the friends I made 
here, I feel suddenly attached to 
the Midwestern identity (at the 
chagrin of my East Coast raised 
sister who I love dearly and 
demand to be present more in 
this essay). 

Being in Michigan, finding 

more people of color and Brown 
and Asian and Muslim friends, 
finding people who care about 
politics 
and 
journalism 
and 

social justice and talking about 
bad horror movies and comic 
books and artsy nonsense, gave 
me my home. And Michigan in 
Color made me think about my 
place in the world, my identity in 
relation to it, and what I can do to 
be a better and more thoughtful 
person. 

I will always aim to grow — I 

will always want to grow. I will 
slip up, say something wrong, 
do something wrong. I know the 
people around me will make sure 
to help me correct my mistakes, 
to be a humble and gracious 
person.

I do not know where I will be 

in the next few years but, despite 
any of the rough times I had 
in college, I will miss being in 
Michigan. I will miss The Daily 
and this wonderful space. I will 
miss this part of my life but I hope 
that leaving college will not stop 
me from growing and expanding 
my world.

On December 6, 2015 — 

the night of my 18th birthday 
— I received an email that 
began, “Congratulations! We 
are very happy to inform you 
that you will be one of the five 
Senior Editors of the Opinion 
section for the Winter 2016 
term!” The paragraph went 
on to name the four other 
editors I’d be working with, 
and ended with an invitation 
to brunch the next morning. 
In hindsight, that email was 
one of the best birthday gifts 
I’ve ever received — although 
I didn’t know it at the time. 
I 
was 
nervous, 
shocked, 

but, most of all, excited. 
Nonetheless, I never could 
have imagined what the next 
few years would bring. 

From 
my 
one 
semester 

as an opinion senior editor, 
to my two years as a MiC 
managing editor, no evening 
in the newsroom was identical 
to another. As a result, it’s 
tough to distill my time at 
420 Maynard into a short 
reflection — but I’m always up 
for a challenge. 

First, to Ashley: I truly 

can’t believe you didn’t rip 
my head off over the past few 
years (although I suppose 
there’s still time). While I 
had a blast during my time in 
the newsroom, I’d be lying if 
I said we didn’t also have our 
fair share of stressful nights. 
However, even in the depths 
of our most chaotic moments, 
you were still able to prioritize 
the needs of the section and 
the paper — even if that came 

at the price of a late night 
or missed assignment. Your 
dedication, drive, and passion 
are truly admirable, and we 
couldn’t have accomplished 
a fraction of what we did 
without it. Thank you for 
being my co-ME, and, above 
all, thank you for being one of 
my best friends. 

Second, I’m so thankful 

to have been a part of an 

organization with as much 
tradition and history as The 
Michigan Daily. While being 
surrounded by century-old 
copies of The Daily offered 
a sobering reminder of how 
short my time on campus 
is, the knowledge that I 
was contributing to such a 
renowned space never failed to 
excite me. More importantly, 
however, I’m so honored to 
have had the opportunity to 
help shape these traditions 
as the paper evolved over the 
past four years. 

And third, in light of our 

turbulent social and political 
climate, 
I’m 
even 
more 

thankful for the broader Daily 
community. 
Without 
this 

space, I honestly don’t know 
how I would’ve expressed my 
frustrations with inequities 
both on campus and beyond. 
Furthermore, I feel lucky 
to have been able to give 
others a similar opportunity. 
From working with student 
organizers to publish their 
lists of demands, to exposing 
incidents of hate and vitriol 
around 
campus, 
I 
feel 

immense privilege that I was 
able to be, in some small way, 
a bullhorn for the voiceless. 
And in a world seemingly gone 
mad, The Daily remained my 
sanctuary.

To all of the friends I’ve 

made over the past four years 
— 
Sophie, 
Adam, 
Tanya, 

Christian, 
Alexa, 
Emma, 

and countless other — thank 
you. Thank you for crying 
with me during my lows and 
celebrating with me during 
my highs.

To Na’kia and Carly, I have 

no doubt you’ll do wonderful 
things next year. You’re two 
of the smartest and hardest-
working people I know, and 
I am so eager to see how you 
will carry the space forward 
into the future. 

And finally, back to Ashley, 

thanks for the wild ride — I 
think we made a good team.

I can’t wait to see how the 

paper evolves over the next 
year and beyond. Here’s to 128 
more years!

Goodbye Seniors: What We’ve Learned

In a way, The Daily is the 

one constant throughout my 
college life. From my start as an 
Opinion writer to the strange 
events that led me to becoming 
an ME, The Daily gave me the 
space to learn what it means to 
be a writer, an activist, and a 
leader. 

I continue to be thankful 

for, and look back fondly, on 
the 
opportunities 
I’ve 
had 

here. Some of it is the nature 
of the job: I just got to do some 
incredible things as a member 
of Michigan in Color. Others are 
from being around wonderful 
people. Nights spent talking 
until 5 am, Jeopardy kickbacks, 
and wreaking havoc with Jason 
and Sophie — it’s difficult to 
describe the beautifully weird 
moments that happen when 

you put sports stars, theatre 
kids, social justice warriors, 
meme 
creators, 
responsible 

journalists, and more in the 
same room 5 nights a week. 

I like to think The Daily and 

MiC have changed and evolved 
over the last few years. MiC 
grew from upstart column to 
full-fledged section (with a 
desk!). The Daily became more 
willing to accommodate the 
needs of this campus’ most 
marginalized — in our coverage 
and our workspace. I feel 
privileged to have witnessed 
and been a small part of that 
change, and hopeful that the 
necessary changes will extend 
far beyond my time. 

As 
I 
write 
this 
senior 

goodbye, I struggle reconciling 
what it means to be a part of 

both Michigan in Color and The 
Michigan Daily. In my mind, 
the two are distinct entities 
— 
though 
perhaps 
closer 
 

together 
than 
they 
first 

appear. In a perfect world, MiC 
wouldn’t need to exist, yet here 
we are. 

Working for The Daily is 

a privilege. The ability to 
have your work spread across 
campus or meet alumni who 
work for this country’s most 
esteemed publications is not 
an opportunity afforded to 
everyone. From my time here, 
I look back on warm memories; 
looking forward, I see opened 
doors. It is my hope that one day 
every student who strives to 
find those same opportunities 
in our newspaper can — and 
will.

Though my time at Michigan 

in Color was short, it was 
memorable. My experience at 
The Michigan Daily seemed 
to be a culmination of all the 
lessons I learned in college. 
This space taught me how 
to navigate complicated and 
controversial issues without 
losing sight of my values. I 
learned how crucial it is for 
platforms like this to exist in 
a world that isn’t inclined to 
give people of color the space 

to voice our opinions. This is 
a community that truly strives 
to live our values. Michigan in 
Color has been a space where 
I’ve felt affirmed, appreciated 
and accepted. I want to thank 
the entire Michigan in Color 
family for being a part of 
this community that meant 
so much to me this year. I’m 
happy I decided to be a part of 
this incredible group of people 
this past year, and I’m sad to 
say goodbye. 

I joined Michigan in Color 

as an eager sophomore that 
just rediscovered her love of 
writing. I did not know exactly 
what I was signing up for but 
never imagined I would gain 
the support system and home 
I have in MiC.

Being a Senior Editor was 

one of the most challenging 
yet 
rewording 
things 
I 

have ever done. I came in 
knowing the stories of my 
peers varied vastly, but I 
left 
with 
an 
appreciation 

and 
understanding 
of 
the 

magnitude of the weight they 
carry on their shoulders.

MiC has opened so many 

doors for me, metaphorically 
and literally. Growing up I did 
not have the privilege to even 
think of a career in writing. I 
did not realize and could not 
even to begin to imagine myself 
as a professional writer, let 

alone editor. MiC has given me 
the space to publish my work 
and release some of the weight 
of my deepest thoughts. MiC 
has lifted my writing to new 
heights and helped me receive 
the attention of foundations 
that want to pay to hear my 
voice. But above all, MiC has 
give me the opportunity to 
uplift other voices. 

Even though my MiC family 

started with just 8 people, it is 
the most meaningful network 
I have. I watched my fellow 
editors land jobs of their 
dreams in D.C., New York 
and California, and knew no 
matter where we all ended 
up I will always have them. 
Now as I get ready to head to 
medical school, a feat they 
supported me every step of the 
way through, I am incredibly 
humbled to have been a part of 
Michigan in Color.

W

hat 
began 
as 
a 
debate 
over 
the 
dinner table at the 
Mosher-Jordan Dining Hall 
festered 
into 
the 
ominous 
realization that we are all 
unsuspecting 
advocates 
for 
a consumerist society. Well, 
not necessarily all, but most 
of us. As we ate dinner with 
each other on a busy, work-
filled Sunday, my friends and 
I found ourselves engaged in 
an intense discussion over a 
rather odd controversy: green 
grass.
A friend of mine had pitted 
himself against the entire 
table of 11 people, voicing his 
individual acrimony toward 
the green lawns many of us 
had been raised to love. The 
rest of us were infuriated; 
we couldn’t fathom why our 
beloved green grass was even 
up for question. Many of us 
justified that lawns are good 
for the property boundaries, 
the multitude of recreational 
uses they can provide and 
for being one of the more 
admirable components of the 
suburban aesthetic. I, too, 
argued against him, but as I 
soon as I said, “We want it for 
the aesthetic,” I shuddered.
I know why he continued 
to 
argue 
even 
when 
we 
were 
so 
appalled 
by 
his 
ridiculousness. 
Intuitively, 
he knew that our concept 
of beauty should transcend 
beyond mere aesthetic. He 
was crying out for a society 
that values the natural beauty 
of our world instead one that 
orients our likings to the 
lifestyles we were raised with 
and leads us to avoid being 
independent, real and natural. 
What he realized is what 
many of us have not come to 
terms with: We will always 
uphold our culture before we 
give our attention away to our 
environment.
We interact every day with 
the people around us, waking 
up 
and 
eating 
breakfast, 
traveling to school or work, 
earning money at work and 
giving it back to our economy 
at the store, using social 

media 
and 
investing 
time 
in our physical and mental 
health. But we are never truly 
thinking in the best interest 
of our society each day we 
interact with it — we are 
merely using it, consuming 
it. Every day, millions of us 
consume the electrical and 
nonrenewable energy in our 
infrastructure, consume the 
satisfaction of data presented 
in all sorts of forms on our 
various social media apps, 
consume 
the 
conveniences 
of 
processed 
goods 
and 
acquiring necessities digitally 
and consume the idea that 
the way we serve back to our 

resourceful society is through 
money. As we spend money 
toward the irrigation of our 
green lawns, for instance, we 
are usually wasting 50 percent 
of our water in runoff and 
experience the consequences 
of dry spells in large regions 
like California as a result. 
Thus, what we should have 
come to realize by now is that 
this idea we have created for 
ourselves is dangerously far 
from the truth — the way we 
give back to our civilization 
is to act so that it may persist 
well into the future.
For 
some, 
the 
aesthetic 
of 
a 
manicured 
backyard, 
artsy social media account or 
display of wealth in the form 
of a house or a car is worth 
it. Our society has somehow 
ingrained in our psyche that 
we are missing out if we don’t 
have these things or if we are 
not striving to achieve these 
things in the future. When 
our 
circumstances 
put 
us 
outside of or away from these 

goals, we will naturally feel 
excluded 
and 
can 
develop 
depression 
because 
of 
it. 
When we are placed outside 
of an environment we are 
predisposed to prefer, we will 
naturally strive to become a 
part of that environment again. 
For instance, we are prone 
to changing cities with the 
mental goal of reigniting the 
chance for new opportunities 
to continue our growth if our 
current surroundings prevent 
that. Many physically travel 
to scenic, more pleasurable 
places 
during 
the 
winter 
to avoid seasonal affective 
disorder, a type of depression 
that reduces the body’s ability 
to feel mentally and physically 
energized 
during 
gloomy 
seasons.
I blame our materialistic 
society for causing us to orient 
ourselves 
toward 
material 
achievements and to do all that 
we can to avoid being excluded 
from that material lifestyle 
based on the hard feelings 
that would follow. Had we 
prioritized and normalized a 
society oriented around the 
health of our environment, 
we would be able to project 
a 
bright 
future 
for 
our 
civilization today because we 
would have understood that 
our future is inevitably more 
important than an aesthetic 
culture. In theory, we should 
be able to resolve what we are 
to blame for. But as we seek 
to discover ourselves and to 
be able to tell our individual 
stories, we will never truly 
stay connected with the power 
that exists in the masses and 
therefore will never be able to 
make a drastic enough change 
to our society’s ways.
At this point, I would just 
like to thank my friend, the 
rebel and the idealist in this 
society, 
for 
enlightening 
me on how to be a realist in 
that other world where we 
value the common sense of 
sustaining our future.

L

ately, when people ask 
me how I’m doing, I 
explain how I’ve been 
pretty overwhelmed 
and 
stressed 
by 
my 
workload 
and 
commitments 
this 
semester. 
Either 
they 
respond 
sharing 
the 
same 
feelings and we gab 
on and on about the 
struggles of failing 
to juggle it all, or 
they say they hope 
I’m 
finding 
time 
to take care of myself. I’m 
relieved yet sad to know I’m 
not the only one experiencing 
all-consuming 
stress. 
But 
when 
given 
the 
second 
response, I’m often annoyed 
that people mention taking 
care of myself, because I’m 
trying to do that, I just often 
don’t feel like I have the time.
In my Community Action 
and Social Change classes, 
many of them have lessons 
on self-care. They mention 
how 
in 
professions 
where 
you are working with others 
or for causes where there is 
little immediate gratification, 
common in the social services, 
you need to take care of 
yourself. Self-care is crucial 
to avoid burnout, where you 
cannot do your work any 
longer due to not prioritizing 
your 
needs. 
Everyone 
has 
different self-care practices, 
from 
reading 
or 
watching 
some TV at the end of the 
day to journaling, listening 
to music, going on a run or 
taking a bath. These self-care 
practices 
are 
supposed 
to 
allow one to unwind and take 
some time out of the day to 
spend on oneself.
My professors encourage 
us to create some of these 
practices 
for 
ourselves. 
My practices are watching 
several 
NPR 
“Tiny 
Desk” 
concerts, 
re-watching 
old 
sitcoms 
like 
“New 
Girl”, 
taking a shower, going on a 
walk or playing my ukulele. 
But on nights when I have 
multiple assignments, a house 
emergency and an exam the 
next day, I do not prioritize 
taking care of myself. I put my 
commitments and obligations 
first, because I often worry 
about falling behind.
I see this competitive drive 
in my friends and fellow 
classmates at our university. 

Last week, a friend of mine 
with strep throat continued 
to go to her classes — even 
though 
the 
best 
way for her to get 
better was to stay 
home and rest — 
because she did not 
want to miss class. 
Observing this need 
to push through it 
all, I have noticed 
we have a really 
hard 
time 
taking 
a break from class 
and our obligations, 
even when we are physically 
sick or dealing with our 
mental health.
This message is not just 
fostered at our university but 
in our society overall. It is the 
framework of our economic 
system. 
Competition 
is 
what 
drives 
our 
markets 

and fuels economic growth 
in our capitalistic society. 
I 
remember 
learning 
in 
economics that competition 
has been known to create 
better goods and drive people 
to 
work 
harder, 
because 
they can compete with one 
another.
I think this competitive 
drive that is felt in the 
economic world generalizes 
to our academic world as well. 
This competition is damaging 
when 
students 
put 
their 
physical and mental health 
on the line to compete with 
their fellow students to get 
the best grade point average 
and impressive résumés to get 
into the best graduate schools 
and jobs. But there is the 
overarching ideal that we will 
not get into the best graduate 
school or job we want unless 
we are doing better than 
those around us.
This 
notion 
of 
always 
having to work and perform 
is 
fundamental 
to 
our 
society. People are not even 
guaranteed good health care 

unless they are a working 
person in our country. If one 
cannot work or compete at the 
same level as everyone else, 
there are real consequences 
in the resources one receives. 
This 
means 
even 
if 
one 
doesn’t care or doesn’t want 
to compete with others, one 
has to participate in a society 
where the reason one is doing 
better is because others are 
not as well off.
Throughout high school, I 
was always trying to do well 
in my classes so I could get 
into a competitive college, 
but now that I’m at this 
competitive college, I cannot 
turn off the need to perform 
exceptionally well in classes. 
Even though I don’t have 
any 
competitive 
graduate 
program driving me, I still 
feel this need to do my best or 
be better than those around 
me.
Last academic year, I made 
a promise to myself that I 
would focus on me first and 
my relationships, the things 
that bring me joy and my 
classwork 
second. 
I 
still 
performed well in my classes, 
but I felt so much happier. 
But this semester, something 
felt different. Maybe it is that 
my time is ending as a senior 
or that I have a harder and 
larger workload. Honestly, 
I think that I lost this 
promise I made to myself. 
I have begun to prioritize 
my classwork, commitments 
and obligations over my own 
wellbeing, and I’m not okay 
with it.
Now that the semester is 
coming to an end, I’ve been 
able to ref lect that I took 
on too many commitments 
and 
got 
caught 
up 
in 
our 
competitive 
college 
atmosphere. It is not easy 
to 
prioritize 
ourselves 
and 
make 
time 
when 
it 
can impact our ability to 
succeed in school or work. 
It is upsetting to me that I 
live in a society that values 
competition and work before 
well-being. And the truth 
is I don’t need to be the 
best or beat others to feel 
comfortable, 
happy 
and 
successful. I just need to do 
me.

P

harmSci 
420, 
a 
new 
University of Michigan 
course beginning Winter 
2019, will explore all aspects of 
the medicinal use of cannabis. 
Legalization 
of 
recreational 
marijuana 
in 
Michigan 
indicates 
voters are interested 
in 
the 
idea, 
yet 
contradictory 
federal 
laws 
limit 
our ability to explore 
it 
academically. 
The 
University 
of 
Michigan is known 
for 
its 
variety 
of 
classes that present experiential 
learning opportunities, and it 
maintains the legacy with the 
new cannabis course that meets 
student demands and ends the 
disconnect.
The endocannabinoid system 
is versatile and ubiquitous. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
pharmaceutical 
sciences 
professor Gus Rosania explained 
how THC receptors are involved 
with stress and sleep, appetite 
and gastrointestinal function, 
even pain and inflammation. 
The endocannabinoid system 
is also the part of our biology 
that responds to cannabis, and 
according to Rosania, it “is 
just not taught in our curricula 
because of federal prohibition.”
Rosania 
began 
planning 
the class four years ago; he 
was encouraged by colleagues 
and distinguished College of 
Pharmacy professors Gordon 
Amidon and James T. Dalton, 
who is also the College of 
Pharmacy dean. Most faculty, 
however, believed the course to 
be a joke.
“A medicinal cannabis course 
is as relevant and real as a 
course gets for our students,” 
Rosania said. The course will 
teach the science, concepts and 
laws that ultimately amounted 
to cannabis prohibition and 
legalization, and exists thanks 
to student input.
Student 
organizations, 
such as cannabis club Green 
Wolverine, played a large role 

in introducing the College of 
Pharmacy to the larger interest 
in and benefits of cannabis. 
Earlier this semester, the Green 
Wolverine Science Symposium 
promoted discussion 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
business and politics 
by hosting a dozen 
leading 
experts, 
including 
Rosania, 
to speak at the event. 
The club exists within 
the Ross School of 
Business, 
and 
the 
club’s members are 
eager to take their 
well-respected 
business degrees to the cannabis 
industry. Undergraduates in the 
club, Rosania said, “showed me 
how serious they were about 
learning and that there was an 
unmet need that really needed 
to be addressed.”
A majority of states, Michigan 
included, have legalized access 
to cannabis in one form or 
another, 
leaving 
only 
four 
states with no public access. 
In Ann Arbor, legalization has 
spurred talk about recreational 
dispensaries in addition to the 
24 medicinal ones we already 
have. Still, cannabis remains a 
Schedule 1 substance, meaning 
our federal government does 
not justify its use as medicinally 
valid.
“A lot of what we teach has 
been mandated by the federal 
government 
and 
centralized 
accreditation entities,” Rosania 
said. 
“Clearly, 
there 
is 
a 
disconnect.”
The 
standard 
curriculum 
was, in Rosania’s words, “out of 
touch with reality.”
There are still open seats, and 
a diverse crowd of University 
students are already signed up to 
fill PharmSci 420’s first lecture 
room. Thus far, half the students 
are Pharmacy students, as the 
course is primarily designed to 
supplement the pharmaceutical 
sciences 
undergraduate 
program. 
The 
other 
half 
comprises 
undergraduates 
studying 
biochemistry, 
neuroscience, 
psychology, 

botany, engineering, computer 
science, public health … the list 
goes on. The only similarity 
among the enrolled is their 
interest in cannabis research.
“Our 
teaching 
needs 
to 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
our 
students,” 
Rosania 
said. 
PharmSci 420 does just that.
Other new classes for Winter 
2019 meet student demands 
and keep up with the times, 
including a psychology course 
“American 
Addictions”, 

American culture course on 
virtual reality, and Comm 408: 
“Understanding 
Self-Control, 
Media 
Habits 
and 
Media 
Addiction”. Though not the 
first school to offer a cannabis 
course, the University already 
offers 
unique 
classes 
that 
keep our curricula relevant 
and 
constantly 
expanding. 
This 
past 
fall, 
the 
School 
of Art & Design created an 
inspirational and entertaining 
“Voting is Sexy” campaign 
for the midterm election, and 
LSA offered an art history 
course called “Emoji Worlds” 
that discussed the trend that 
changed the communication of 
emotion. Communications and 
history courses examined fake 
news, the School of Education 
addressed inequalities among 
the homeless and one course 
currently 
investigates 
cold 
cases regarding racial crime 
and injustice in Michigan.
Some may call the course a 
sign of the times, others may 
find it controversial. Regardless, 
the vision Rosania has in mind 
supersedes that of the federal 
government.
“My teaching is not paid for 
by Congress, the Supreme Court 
or the White House,” Rosania 
said, explaining that his mission 
is to address the educational 
demands of our students, and of 
the U.S. citizens that live here 
in Michigan. “I can only hope 
that it is the beginning of an 
educational revolution.”

Director Daniel Goldhaber talks ‘Cam,’ collaboration 
and the normalization of sex work through cinema

A few days before writing this 
article, my Instagram briefly got 
hacked. My initial reaction was 
confusion, followed by a sudden 
surge of panic and a series of 
unanswerable questions: How 
could this have happened? Who 
could have done this? Why 
me? Once I logged back into 
my account, I found that my 
username and email address 
had been changed to something 
completely 
different. 
After 
hastily 
putting 
the 
correct 
information back in, I thought 
more about this collective fear 
embedded in our culture of 
online identity theft, that at 
any given moment, a random 
stranger could access and distort 
the intimate details that define 
how we are perceived on the 
Internet and beyond.
This bewilderment, paranoia 
and dread that manifested from 
this momentarily scary situation 
are the same emotions endured 
to an extreme by the protagonist 
of the glossy, thought-provoking 
psychological thriller “Cam,” 
which premiered at the Fantasia 
International 
Film 
Festival 
in July and on Netflix in Nov. 
The film follows cam girl Alice 
(Madeline Brewer, “Orange is 
the New Black”), who faces an 
unexpected dilemma when she 
is locked out of her account and 
finds a doppelgänger has taken 
her place.
While 
Instagram 
is 
not 
at the forefront of the film’s 
premise, “Cam” reflects the 
same existential horror someone 
might encounter when their 
online profile has been violated 
and 
exploited 
out 
of 
their 
control. In the specific case 
of Alice, who operates as an 
online sex worker, this issue is 
particularly 
anxiety-inducing. 
As Alice sets out on a desperate 

quest to investigate how this 
“clone” took over her life, “Cam” 
gradually blurs the lines between 
fantasy and reality, resulting in 
a twisty, unnerving and utterly 
captivating viewing experience.
Although “Cam” is his feature-
length directorial debut, Daniel 
Goldhaber has directed music 
videos for ambient rock artists 
Michal Menert and StaG and 
worked on several short films 
and 
commercials, 
including 
an ad for MapQuest that won 
the 2016 Emmy Award for Best 
Commercial, Single Spot. In an 
exclusive phone interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Goldhaber 
talks about the process of making 
the film, finding his lead from 
a “Black Mirror” episode and 
normalizing sex work through 
an immersive narrative.
The Michigan Daily: Tell 
me a little bit about your 
background, what got you 
interested 
in 
filmmaking, 
where you went to undergrad, 
what you studied, etc.
Daniel Goldhaber: I grew 
up in Denver, CO. I went to 
Harvard for undergrad. They 
have 
a 
department 
called 
the 
Department 
of 
Visual 
and 
Environmental 
Studies. 
Essentially, it’s a combination of 
film, photography, studio art and 
visual theory all up in one. I had 
known about it in high school 
and that Darren Aronofsky, who 
I was quite obsessed with, had 
gone through the department. 
I learned just a little about 
what the pedagogy was like 
there, which is very different, 
I think, from how a lot of film 
departments are run in this 
country.
There’s not so much a focus on 
production as much as there is a 
focus on learning what is a movie, 
how you watch film, what is the 
meaning of images, what are the 
ethics of images, why make a 
movie. The big exercise they do 
that was pretty formative for me 

is that the first year that you’re 
in the film program, the entire 
class directs a documentary film 
by committee over the course of 
a semester. There’s no director, 
so it takes this idea of authorship 
and it really focuses the idea of 
authorship on the collaborative 
filmmaking process. I think 
that 
that’s 
something 
that’s 
really under-talked about and 
under-thought about, especially 
in film school. Filmmaking is a 
collaborative medium, but we 
can kind of just automatically 
assume the authorship belongs 
to a director.
When you’re directing a film 
by committee with a whole class, 
you really start to think about 
the nature of authorship and the 
nature of the filmmaking process 
quite differently. One of the other 
cool things about the program is 
that there’s no permanent film 
faculty there. It’s all visiting 
professors. You don’t get that 
stale sense that I think you get in 
a lot of film departments where 
it’s three or four professors 
with their idea of what a good 
narrative film is and it kind of 
just becomes the house style 
and that’s that. That’s definitely 
true of Harvard, which is mostly 
a documentary program, but 
with new blood, it keeps the 
intellectual conversation around 
film alive. 
TMD: How did you venture 
into filmmaking after college?
DG: I did the (short films) 
in college. Kind of everything 
else came after. It was really 
just me trying to survive post-
grad, trying to find work, trying 
to build a reel. Ultimately, 
most of it didn’t really help me 
land a feature film. One of the 
interesting things about getting 
“Cam” made and jump-starting 
my career was that it really was 
just a script, the idea, the clarity 
of vision that me and (“Cam” 
screenwriter) 
Isa 
and 
our 
creative producers at Divide/

Conquer all had. We didn’t get 
into the Sundance Labs. I didn’t 
ever have a short film at a major 
film festival. It really was just 
faith in the ideas and that we 
could answer any question that 
we were asked.
TMD: I read that the film’s 
screenwriter 
Isa 
Mazzei 
worked as a camgirl, which 
helped inspire and shape the 
story. How did you two get 
together to collaborate and 
what was that collaboration 
like?
DG: We’ve known each other 
since high school. We actually 
dated in high school. And we’ve 
been collaborating since that 
point in time too in some form 
or another. Ultimately, what 
happened is she hired me to 
shoot… long after that, she went 
into camming and when she 
started camming, she needed 
to make a bunch of promotional 
video content for her show 
and thought that I might make 
some good porn for her. That 
was my introduction to the 
world of cam. Her story and her 
approach to her own practice of 
sex work … I think that we both 
felt like there was a film to be 
made about it. Through a series 
of conversations, we kind of 
just found that making a genre 
movie set in that world would 
be the best way to communicate 
our ideas to a large, commercial 
audience, which was really the 
goal.
TMD: 
“Cam” 
tackles 
a 
dense bevy of topical themes 
— 
namely, 
the 
obsession 
with maintaining an online 
identity, the commodification 
of desire, the male gaze and the 
conflation of sex and violence. 
What were you hoping people 
would get out of watching the 
film?
DG: Politically, I think that 
the goal was to tell a story 
that would ask an audience to 
empathize with a sex worker 
who was a creative 
professional 
and 
to make a film that 
was from her point 
of view formally, 
that it’s from a 
woman’s point of 
view, 
portraying 
her sexuality as 
she sees herself. 
From a filmmaking 
standpoint, 
I 
think 
that 
was 
another 
goal. 
But ultimately, I 
think that movies 
are 
empathy 
machines 
on 
a 
certain level. We 
wanted to reflect 
Isa’s 
experiences 
of being a cam 
girl, being a sex 
worker, 
talking 
about 
putting 
forth an example 
of how she feels 
like her experience 
of a sex worker 
was for her and a 
way of thinking 
about 
portraying 
sex work in media 
in a more ethical, 
representational 
capacity. Also, just 
wanting to make a 
movie that felt true 
to our experiences 
of being online… 
there’s no moral to 
the story outside of 
the politics of its 
representation. 
TMD: 
Madeline Brewer 
gives a striking 
performance 
as 
the 
main 
character 
Alice. 
How did you land 
on casting her as 
the lead?
DG: 
My 
dad 
actually 
saw 
Maddie 
(Brewer) 
in an episode of 
“Black 
Mirror” 
and was like, “She’s 
really perfect for 
this.” So, we just 
really beat down 
our 
manager’s 
door. 
Luckily, 
someone on our 
team 
knew 
her 

manager and beat down his door 
and got him to actually meet 
with me before she even read the 
script, so that I can kind of be 
like, “Hey! So, this is crazy, but 
here’s what we want to do with 
it…” That was really effective. 
She read the script and then she 
met with Isa and then came in 
to read for us and we cast her 
within minutes later. What was 
so immediately telling about her 
earlier work was that we needed 
a film in which the actor can go 
from a completely naturalistic 
person to algorithmic sex robot. 
Maddie has that kind of rare 
combination of technical ability 
and naturalism. She’s a very 
technical actress and you can 
tell that in her performance. She 
never feels particularly “act-y.”
TMD: There’s some stigma 
surrounding 
“the 
cyber-
cinema” subgenre — films that 
revolve 
specifically 
around 
technology. But considering 
the attention your film is 
getting and the success of 
other recent indie films like 
“Ingrid 
Goes 
West” 
and 
“Searching,” do you think 
cyber-cinema 
will 
receive 
more critical recognition in 
the years to come?
DG: I think good movies 
should 
receive 
critical 
recognition, regardless of what 
they are. I can’t think of a 
cyber-cinema movie about the 
Internet or technology that’s 
really good that’s gone horribly 
unrecognized. Even a movie 
like 
“Unfriended,” 
which 
is 
pretty genre, was very well-
reviewed and I think was a 
game-changing movie in a lot of 
respects. The reason that a lot 
of “cyber-cinema” hasn’t been 
taken seriously is that it’s been 
made by people who didn’t grow 
up with the Internet. I’ve had 
social media since elementary 
school in some form or another. 
There’s no alienation factor. 
People have seen the Internet as 
an impediment — “Oh, movies 
set in the modern day, we kind 
of have to deal with this Internet 
thing in order to do that.” But 
they’re not taking a step back and 
saying, “Hey, there’s this new 
thing that exists. Let’s change 
the way we think and interact. 
How do we make cinema that 
responds to that? Is there one 
way to do that?”
What we wanted to do with 
“Cam” was simply say, “How do 
we show the main character’s 
experience online with no tricks, 
just editing? Let’s go back to the 
basic fundamentals of cinema 
and build up from there.” That’s 
where the use of the cut-ins 
came from. The kind of flat space 
of the Internet that’s seen in the 
movie — that was very inspired 
by “Unfriended.” On some level, 
I think the movie is a refutation 
of this screenlife idea that if 
you’re gonna make a movie 
online, it has to only take place 
online. What I’m interested in is 
the collision between the digital 
and real.
TMD: What was the process 
of conceptualizing “Cam”?
DG: 
It’s 
honestly 
really 
complicated in the sense that it 
was a really organic process, it’s 
a talking process, it’s a process 
of sharing ideas and constantly 
challenging 
each 
other 
to 
specify the idea, to dig deeper 
into the idea and then to find the 
best possible way to deliver the 
idea inside of the architecture 
of a commercial movie. P.T. 
Anderson says that “writing is 
like ironing.” I think sometimes, 
it’s also about layering things 
into each other, so you start 
with this idea of a movie about 
webcam porn. What’s the right 
story for that? One of the things 
I really like to do process-wise 
when I’m working with anybody 
is trying to build world banks, 
to build a big bank of, “Here are 
all the potential stories we could 
tell in that world.” And then, 
we start whittling them down: 
Which of these stories are good? 
Which of these stories have 
common ideas?
Eventually, we actually met 
with a bunch of other cam 
girls 
and 
sex 
workers 
and 
interviewed them. We’re trying 
to find the similarities between 
Isa’s 
experiences 
and 
their 

experiences, trying to figure 
out which of the more universal 
things was connecting these 
ideas. Then, whittling that idea 
down to the idea of identity, the 
dopplegänger. You start saying, 
“OK, well, what’s that look like?” 
You start talking about the big 
themes that you’re interested 
in. Isa would frequently talk 
about her practice as a former 
performance artist and how 
it felt to her. So, OK, that’s 
something that is a very relatable 
idea for people. What are movies 
about great artists that we really 
love?
TMD: How were you able 
to get “Cam” financed and 
distributed?
DG: (Blumhouse Productions 
CEO 
Jason) 
Blum 
basically 
financed the movie and set it 
up at a production company 
called Divide/Conquer. Divide/
Conquer 
finished 
the 
film. 
Blum bought the film back and 
then they sold it to Netflix. 
Blumhouse 
helped 
develop 
the script. They were kind of 
advisors on the project, but they 
weren’t significantly involved 
in the day-to-day making of 
the film. Couper Samuelson 
and Bea Sequeira were the two 
executives over there that we 
worked really closely with. Bea 
was the person who found the 
script and kind of kicked it up to 
Couper. Both really championed 
the film and gave notes and 
helped us connect with people 
when necessary. It’s an amazing 
company. They’re doing amazing 
work. Jason’s some sort of cross 
between Roger Corman and… 
I need to figure out who else 
because he’s not just Corman. 
He’s taking what Corman did 
and he’s bringing it into the 
mainstream, 
and 
it’s 
really 
interesting. 
TMD: What has been your 
reaction to the film’s response 
from audiences and critics?
DG: I’m surprised that the 
ending has gotten the response 
that it’s gotten. To be completely 
honest, I don’t think the movie 
is nearly as confusing as people 
seem to think it is. People were 
like, “What is Lola?” And all the 
evidence is in the film for what 
she is. It’s not that we don’t 
explain it — the main character 
figures it out. We don’t literally 
spell it out because you’re seeing 
it from (Alice’s) perspective and 
she’s figuring it out on her own. 
I’m kind of surprised that that’s 
as controversial as it is. That’s 
more of an audience response 
thing than a critical response, 
and that’s really not something 
that became clear until after it 
was actually out on Netflix. It’s 
been extremely satisfying to 
see the critical response to the 
film. (“Cam”) is like the second 
highest-rated horror movie of 
the year on Rotten Tomatoes.
It’s 
extremely 
gratifying 
also to see the politics of the 
movie be embraced in the way 
that they are. It was a surprise 
when The New York Times 
called it a “feminist film.” We 
have to take a second to realize 
that that’s The New York Times 
Arts 
section 
embracing 
the 
destigmatization of sex work 
and the legitimization of sex 
worker narratives from that 
point of view. That’s a really big 
step forward. I don’t even think 
that that was even a conscious 
decision on the part of (New 
York Times critic) Jeannette 
Catsoulis. I think that was just 
kind of what she took away from 
the film.
To me, one of the most 
gratifying things for a filmmaker 
is when you’ve told a story, you 
put an incredible amount of work 
into the politics of the film, but 
that ultimately, a great political 
film isn’t necessarily one where 
it ends with a big speech with 
somebody explaining what the 
politics of the movie is. It’s a 
movie that’s taking you into 
somebody 
else’s 
world 
and 
allowing you to empathize with 
them in a way that only film can. 
When that’s been successful, 
you can’t necessarily explain 
it. You just know that you had 
that experience. Seeing people 
embrace the experience they 
had with “Cam” has been really 
amazing.

FILM INTERVIEW


There were two stages set up at 
the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit 
on Dec. 5 for Travis Scott’s “Wish 
You Were Here” Tour — one main 
stage in the front and one side 
stage, unimposing even with the 
yawning “O” of the carousel roller 
coaster that had been built on top of 
it, in the back. The fellow Daily Arts 
Writer who was also attending the 
show knew that Travis was going 
to perform the first few songs of the 
show on the back stage and then 
transition to the main stage by way 
of roller coaster. We looked up. The 
skeleton of a roller coaster track 
hung from the arena’s roof. We 
moved to the smaller stage in the 
back and, having guessed correctly, 
found ourselves arms length away 
from Travis Scott himself when the 
show finally started, riding the crest 
of a monstrous mosh pit, losing our 
minds to “STARGAZING.”
Much like ASTROWORLD itself, 
the “Wish You Were Here” Tour 
was twisted around the concept 
of a psychedelic carnival. Each 
detail of the show strove to be more 

ostentatious than the last. The 
visuals were trippy and brightly 
colored, some stretched out of 
proportion as if placed in front of a 
funhouse mirror. Halfway through 
the set, a larger than life astronaut 
popped out of the ground, dwarfing 
Travis Scott as he sat on the end of 
the main stage, a literal man on 
the moon. And the performance’s 
coup de grâce — the massive roller 
coaster that stretched above our 
heads from one stage to the other 
— was near sacrilegious, the GA 
crowd following its track in a mass 
that was reminiscent of Kanye’s 
floating stage during the Saint 
Pablo tour.
It almost was too absurdly gaudy 
— the show’s visuals and props in 
danger of overpowering the music 
itself. As you were thrown around 
from one sweaty body to the next, 
the roar of the crowd and your own 
heartbeat echoing in your ears, 
you could barely hear “Mamacita” 
or “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” or 
“HOUSTONFORNICATION.” 
Yet, as Little Caesars Arena 
exploded in whorls of spiraling 
lights and thrashing arms during 
every era of Travis Scott music 
— from “Quintana” and “Drugs 
You Should Try It” that went all 
the way back to Days Before Rodeo 
and Owl Pharaoh to “goosebumps” 
and “way back” from Birds in the 

Trap Sing McKnight to the more 
popular “NO BYSTANDERS” and 
“STOP TRYING TO BE GOD” 
from ASTROWORLD — we were 
shown that these various garish 
and glaring aspects of the show, as 
well as the rage that accompanied 
every aspect, are as much a part of 
a Travis Scott performance as the 
music itself.

That was the first 10 minutes 
of my experience at Travis Scott’s

an arms length from the rail that 
separated the savage crowd from 
the miniature stage on which Scott 
debuted, I was afloat in the oceanic 
energy of the sweaty ragers.
Acknowledging the presence of 
“ragers” at a massively mainstream 
arena concert feels weird to me, and 
that’s the gist of my take on Scott’s 
live show. With conflated identities 
as an imperfect trap demon that 
brought unprecedented energy to 
hip hop and an ambitious chart-
chaser with polished promotional 
tactics, Scott has garnered a 
uniquely eclectic fanbase over

CONCERT REVIEW

On Elizabeth Alexander’s 
masterful words, poetry

“This unlikely thing of being 
a poet has given me a place for all 
that strange music in my brain.” 
There’s 
something 
thrilling 
about walking to UMMA in 
anticipation of a Helen Zell Visiting 
Writers reading. I love sitting in 
the Helmut Stern Auditorium, 
underneath the lights that look like 
floating candles, and gathering in 
The Apse surrounded by artwork 
and artists alike. 
This past Tuesday, I attended 
the Zell Visiting Writer Series with 
readings from Elizabeth Alexander, 
Distinguished Poet in Residence. 
Alexander is an incredibly talented 
writer with a number of accolades 
to show for it. She composed and 
delivered “Praise Song for the 
Day” at the inauguration of former 
President Barack Obama, was a 
Pulitzer Prize finalist for her book 
of poems “American Sublime” and 
was recently appointed President of 
the Andrew H. Mellon Foundation. 
 
But Alexander is more than her 
impressive list of accomplishments. 
She’s deeply curious. She’s thinking 
about big ideas. She’s constantly 
experimenting with sound, form 
and genre. 
Alexander opened her reading 
with a discussion of freedom, 
asking the audience, “What does 
freedom look like? What does it 

look like when we lose it? How do 
we guard it?”
Using 
this 
framework, 
Alexander read “Emancipation.” 
She plays with alliteration in the 
first line: “corncob constellation.” 
The poem is a conglomeration of 
unlikely words, references and 
sounds coming together. Alexander 
mentions Linda Brent, a character 
from “Incidents in the Life of a 
Slave Girl” by Harriet Jacobs, who 
grapples with a choice between 
freedom and staying a slave to be 
with her children. Though the end 
of the poem ends with the lines 
“We’re free,” Brent ultimately 
chooses 
motherhood, 
making 
me wonder if the poem is saying 
emancipation isn’t as easy as being 
told you’re free. 
Throughout 
her 
reading, 
Alexander offered writers in the 
audience small tidbits of advice.
“For those of who you are 
writing, history is an extraordinary 
source,” Alexander said. “Though 
historians have done a great job of 
figuring out the past, there are still 
gaps, and we can fill in the spaces 
historians cannot.” 
Alexander 
thinks 
about 
historical gaps with her poetic 
sequence “Amistad,” which is 
based on the famous story of the 
Amistad ship that was carrying 
African captives to Cuba. The 
captives took control of the 
ship, steering it north until they 
arrived in Connecticut. Alexander 

imagines the perspective of some 
of the captives, from someone who 
watches a blue whale swimming 
alongside the vessel for hours, to a 
little boy who has no mother and 
whose father possibly just died 
next to him. 
My favorite out of Alexander’s 
poems read aloud was “Ars 
Poetica 17: First Afro-American 
Esperantist.” The poem’s strong 
words varied vastly in sound, from 
“gumbo” to “certificate.” This 
poem reminded me that language 
is meant to be spoken and heard, 
as reading the poem in your head 
doesn’t give you the full effect of 
Alexander’s pauses and drawn out 
words. 
Alexander concluded the night 
by reading from her memoir 
“The Light of the World,” in 
which Alexander reflects on the 
unexpected death of her husband, 
who passed away at only 49 years 
old. Though writing a memoir 
gave her a “momentary crisis about 
genre,” she realized “these words 
were poet’s prose.” 
Alexander’s decision to focus 
the reading on the idea of freedom 
was a smart one. In moving 
from historical freedom to the 
personal freedom of writing what 
she needed to grieve, Alexander 
effectively shared how poetry is 
her mental freedom, and can be 
ours too. 
The Zell Visiting Writers Series 
will return next semester.

FLICKR

Travis Scott is peaking on
‘Wish You Were Here’ tour

FLICKR

the course of his career to which 
the Astroworld tour is expertly 
catered. To your left could be a 
24-year-old who got lit to “Upper 
Echelon” while driving to a party 
in her junior year of high school, 
to your right could be a 13-year-
old whose mom is parked outside 
with a budding teenage angst that 
is tragically fueled by “Sicko Mode” 
— and both would leave the concert 
perfectly content.
Oftentimes, arena shows are 
vacuums — the venues are just too 
big and contain too many people to 
emulate the intimacy and energy of 
smaller settings. To compensate, 

these blockbuster performances 
boast incredible stage designs 
with colossal props to keep the 
audience at least visually engaged 
(see: Kendrick Lamar’s “DAMN” 
tour). Somehow, Scott avoided this 
plague, shrinking Little Caesars 
Arena to provide longtime fans 
the chaotic energy they associated 
with the prince of their high school 
hip-hop days while riding a roller 
coaster above the crowd to inspire 
recent fans who couldn’t believe 
they were witnessing their favorite 
superstar in action.
The show was a unique moment 
between young and old — both 

“Mamacita” and “NC-17” received 
equal applause. This rarity is likely 
because Scott rests at a special point 
in his career, with overlapping 
respect from fans of five years and 
fans of five months. This moment 
is incredibly transient — just ask 
Eminem. As an artist grows, 
they shed the characteristics that 
brought them into the spotlight in 
favor of new characteristics that 
attempt to hold the spotlight in 
place as it naturally migrates to 
the next star. I’m glad I was able 
to catch Scott before this demise 
takes place.

Michigan couldn’t stop turning 

the ball over. South Carolina 
couldn’t stop fouling.

It was as sloppy a game as either 

team has played all season. But with 
a few offensive rebounds, a few free 
throws and a lot of Jordan Poole, 
the fifth-ranked Wolverines held 
off the Gamecocks (4-5), 89-78, to 
improve to 10-0.

Saturday’s game at Crisler Center 

was promoted as a “Poole Party,” 
and in front of a Maize Rage clad in 
pool floaties and beach attire, the 
sophomore guard did his part in 
aiding the theme. With 26 points on 
8-for-12 shooting and 4-for-7 beyond 
the arc, Poole paced Michigan with 
a career-high in scoring.

“That’s the Jordan we know,” said 

sophomore forward Isaiah Livers. 
“He can score at all three levels for 
sure. You know he’s going to take 
those threes — step-back threes — 
and he’s got to get one of those out 
of his system.”

The fans who came for the Poole 

party certainly got their money’s 
worth. But that was about all they 
got.

Poole’s huge game 

notwithstanding, the Wolverines 
put forth a thoroughly uninspiring 
performance against a South 
Carolina team which came in with 
losses to Stony 
Brook, Wofford 
and Wyoming.

The Gamecocks 

deserve plenty of 
credit, however. 
The 25th-fastest 
team in the nation, 
per KenPom, 
they succeeded in 
turning the game 
into a track meet, 
putting up 62 shots 
and hitting 32 of 
them. On offense, 
they funneled 
the ball through 
their big men, as 
forwards Chris 
Silva, Maik Kotsar and Keyshawn 
Bryant all scored in double figures.

“Our defense was not great,” 

said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“It’s a tough matchup for us inside, 
and I think we got to get better at 
helping (junior center Jon Teske) 
in the post. Little upset at our team 
that the scouting report said Silva’s 
going to go right, he’s going to go 
right, he’s going to go right, and he 
went right and we still fouled him.”

At the start, it appeared as if 

Michigan would simply run away 
with a routine win against an 
overmatched opponent. Teske 
flushed a midrange jumper to give 
the Wolverines an 11-6 lead at the 
under-16 media timeout.

But South Carolina hung around, 

as it would all game. With 9:36 
remaining in the first half, Kotsar 
banked home a baby hook to put the 
Gamecocks up three.

The Wolverines vastly aided 

matters by turning the ball over 
five times in the first six minutes 
— three of which came from Poole — 
and 11 times in the first half overall.

“We had some really careless 

(turnovers),” Beilein said. “ … But 
we had a few of those. But that’s 
them. They’re good, and you have 

to be able to 
adjust to that, 
and that’s why 
the game was 
really close.”

Michigan’s 

saving grace 
in the first 
half was its 
ability to 
get to the 
line, as it 
already 
was 
in 
the 

double 

bonus 
with seven 

minutes left 

in the 
first half. Poole 

and 
freshman forward 

Ignas Brazdeikis took advantage 
of an aggressive South Carolina 
defense that committed 21 fouls for 
the game. The duo combined to hit 
11 of a combined 13 free throws 
as the Wolverines took a 42-36 
lead into halftime.

The other main positive for 

Michigan was its offensive 
rebounding, as it grabbed a 
season-high 13. Two minutes 
into the second half, redshirt 
junior guard Charles 
Matthews grabbed a board 
off a miss, darted back to 
the 3-point line and drilled 
a trey on the ensuing 
possession. Poole hit a 

triple of 
his own 
on the 

Wolverines’ 
next trip 
down the 
court, and 
finished a wide-
open fastbreak dunk 
minutes later to put 
them up by 11.

With every big 

shot by Michigan, 
however, the 
Gamecocks seemed 

to have an answer. After a highlight-
reel pull-up trey by Poole with 12 
minutes to play, South Carolina 
cut it to single digits with inside 
buckets.

Teske powered down an alley-oop 

with 6:21 remaining to put Crisler 
Center on its feet, setting the 
Wolverines up 16 with what seemed 
to be a finishing blow. But three 
minutes later, the Gamecocks shot 
back within striking distance after 
a basket by Kotsar made the score 
82-73.

In the end, the outcome was never 

really in doubt. Michigan shot 52 
percent from the field, 42 percent 
from deep and 77 percent from 
the foul line. The 16 turnovers it 
committed were an ugly blemish, 
but not enough to cost it a victory.

South Carolina, however, made 

sure it wasn’t a pretty one.

“Today we didn’t play that well 

defensively,” Teske said. “Lot of 
letdowns, but we got some key 
stops. Our offense carried us — 
everyone scored, I don’t know how 
many (Poole) had but he had a great 
game, (Livers) came out shooting 
really well. But when we have our 
offense clicking, it’s hard to beat 
us.”

Another round of Harbaugh rumors
M

y grandfather called 
me last week.
I’ll preface this by 
saying that my grandpa is not 
your typi-
cal hot-take 
sports fan. 
I respect 
his opinions 
on sports 
as much as 
anybody I 
know. So in 
this case, I 
think he was 
probably just 
checking 
in and had a topic in mind he 
thought would make me laugh 
or at least give us something to 
talk about.
He asked me if Jim Harbaugh 
was leaving Michigan.
We had both seen the head-
lines by that time, on ESPN and 
other platforms, that certain 
pundits were reporting that 
certain NFL teams were in talks 
with Harbaugh to pull him from 
the Wolverines and back into the 
ranks of professional football.
I laughed and brushed it off, 
because the reporters I know on 
the Michigan beat, who would 
definitely know if Harbaugh was 
considering leaving Ann Arbor, 
had all but called the reports 
stupid.
Apparently, the rumors, per-
haps aided by the de-commit-
ment of five-star safety Daxton 
Hill, were enough to make Har-
baugh give a response.
“This is a choreographed 
message that comes up at this 
time every year before signing 
day,” Harbaugh told ESPN this 
weekend. “It’s people spreading 
messages to further their own 
personal agenda.
“But I’m on record right here, 
right now: I’m not going any-
where. I’m staying at Michigan. 
We have big plans here, and 
there’s a lot we want to accom-
plish.”

On Sunday, he elaborated 
further when asked why he com-
mented on the story at all.
“To make a 
statement of it,” 
he said. “To go 
on record, and to 
not be asked any 
more after that 
by people who 
like to yap and 
ask questions.”
Thinking back, 
though, the call 
from my grandpa 
wasn’t the first 
time I had gotten the question.
A couple months ago, an edi-
tor from a well-renowned news-
paper called The Daily newsdesk 
asking for me. He was doing a 

story about Harbaugh, and he 
wanted the perspective of some-
one on campus.
Among the 
questions he 
asked was one 
about Harbaugh 
and whether or 
not students and 
fans were losing 
patience with 
him.
I laughed 
then, too. If I 
remember cor-
rectly, it was just 
after Michigan had lost to Notre 
Dame, so I understood that there 
were some questions about the 
state of the program and its lead-
ership.

Now, with the benefit of hind-
sight, it seems ridiculous that 
there are and have been ques-
tions if the Wol-
verines want to 
keep Harbaugh.
Michigan is 
in a far better 
place than it was 
when Harbaugh 
took over. The 
program was 
competing for 
a conference 
championship all 
season, until its 
hopes were snuffed out by Ohio 
State yet again.
Michigan athletic director 
Warde Manuel addressed that 
side of things Sunday. His sup-

port has always been steadfast, 
so his statement should come as 
no surprise.
“Jim is one 
of the greatest 
coaches (in foot-
ball), college or 
pro, so I think it’s 
to his credit his 
name continually 
pops up,” Manuel 
said. “As I said 
before, when 
we think about 
bringing student-
athletes here, we 
want the best, and we have the 
best coach. I just hope people 
understand, and particularly 
our recruits don’t get dissuaded 
because people put out these 

rumors which this man deserves 
because of his ability to coach.
“... Every year as soon as 
there’s an opening, all of a sud-
den his name’s mentioned that 
he’s not going to be here. He and 
I have a great relationship. We 
talked about this from the first 
year on. I have full faith in Jim, 
in the person he is and the leader 
he is of this team. I’m so happy 
he’s our coach. I look forward to 
him coaching, as I said before, 
until he retires from Michigan 
and ends his career here.”
And, listen, I get impatience. 
But wanting better from the 
coach you have is much different 
than wanting a different coach 
altogether.
It is okay to both expect the 
Wolverines to actually win a 
conference championship — or 
better — and want Harbaugh to 
stay on as head coach. Believe it 
or not, those two things are not 
mutually exclusive.
Harbaugh does need to 
improve, and he is the first to 
admit it. Hence, the “there’s a lot 
we want to accomplish,” part of 
his quote to ESPN.
But it seems like if you are 
going to bring up this neverend-
ing question about Harbaugh’s 
permanence at Michigan, you 
have to answer two other ques-
tions first.
First: What gives anybody any 
indication that Harbaugh actu-
ally wants to leave?
Second: If the Wolverines did 
want him gone, who could they 
possibly get that would be bet-
ter?
If you can’t answer the first, 
spare me the waste of time it 
takes to prove any rumors false.
And if you can’t answer the 
second, don’t bother pining for 
greener pastures.

Poole finding consistency

Last February, Crisler Center 
filled with bathing suits and pool 
noodles — a strange sight on a 
snowy mid-winter afternoon in 
Ann Arbor. The ‘Poole Party’ 
theme had been organized by 
the Maize Rage — Michigan’s 
courtside student section — to 
celebrate 
Jordan 
Poole, 
the 
team’s 
swaggering 
freshman 
guard.
The freshman Poole wanted to 
give the crowd what they came 
to see. He came off the bench 
midway through the first half 
and immediately fired off two 
3-point attempts. Both clanged 
iron. The rest of the game was no 
different. Poole attempted four 
threes, made none of them, and 
finished with zero points in 12 
minutes.
Saturday 
against 
South 
Carolina, 
the 
Maize 
Rage 
brought the ‘Poole Party’ theme 
back. With a year of experience 
under his belt, the sophomore 
Poole hit 8-of-12 field goal 
attempts en route to a career-
high 26 points, as the Wolverines 
won 89-78.
“I 
wasn’t 
really 
thinking 
about it,” Poole said of this year’s 
‘Poole Party.’ “I think last year, 
I was thinking about it. … Being 
a freshman, I only played 11 
minutes, I kinda wanted to go 
out there, because it was a Poole 
Party, and play 
excited.”
Games 
like 
the 
Minnesota 
one 
weren’t 
unusual for Poole 
last 
year. 
He 
quickly 
became 
a 
fan 
favorite, 
often 
providing 
a spark off the 
bench, 
like 
he 
did in a 19-point 
game against Indiana or a 4-of-5 
showing from the three against 
Ohio State. But other times, he 
was invisible, scoring less than 
six points in half of Michigan’s 
games.
“Last year as a freshman, he’d 
have moments in which he didn’t 
look as good as he really was,” 

said South Carolina coach Frank 
Martin. “Cause he’d get wrapped 
up in the emotion of the game.”
Earlier this season, it seemed 
as if Poole hadn’t changed. He 
totaled just 13 points over the 
Wolverines’ first three games. 
When it looked as if he busted 
his 
slump 
in 
a 
22-point 
performance 
against 
George 
Washington, 
he followed up 
with four against 
Providence 
the 
next day.
Since 
then, 
Poole 
has 
been 
the 
star 
that 
Michigan 
expected him to be coming 
into the season, hitting 17-of-
28 threes and scoring at least 14 
points in five straight games.
“I just feel like I’m letting the 
game come to me,” Poole said. 
“Taking the right shots but also 
being aggressive.”
“… 
I 
feel 
like 
I 
was 

overthinking, ‘What’s a good 
shot, what’s a bad shot?’ So 
focused about assists to where I 
was passing up a lot of stuff. But 
now coach is giving me the green 
light to be aggressive. They feel 
like I’m one of the best shooters 
in the country.”
That 
green 
light 
paid 
dividends early in the second 
half when the Gamecocks cut 
Michigan’s deficit to six.
Poole pulled up and hit a three 
with a defender draped all over 
him. Then another one, followed 
by a fast-break dunk. He had 
effectively shut the door on South 
Carolina’s comeback hopes and 
rewarded his coach’s green light 
all in a two-minute stretch that 
exemplified everything he was 
anointed to be last season.
As he jogged to Michigan’s 
huddle after his dunk forced 
Martin into a timeout, students 
hurled snorkels and beach towels 
into the air in jubilation.
Somehow — on a freezing 
December day — that now 
seems normal.

‘M’ falls to Minnesota, 4-3, on late heartbeaker

If 
the 
No. 
15 
Michigan 
hockey team thought it would 
get a breather after a fourth 
consecutive overtime game at 
Yost Ice Arena, it took less than 
ten minutes for it to realize that 
was a pipe dream, and 58 minutes 
for a win to become a pipe dream, 
too.
As the Gophers opened up a 
2-0 lead, the Wolverines found 
themselves 
at 
an 
inflection 
point. Though Michigan was 
outshooting Minnesota early, the 
Wolverines failed to capitalize on 
any breakaways or opportunities 
in the crease early on.
While Michigan responded 
by pulling the rug out from 
underneath Minnesota, it was 
eventually the Gophers who got 
the final laugh, scoring a game-
winner with 1:41 left in the game 
and walking out of Yost with a 4-3 
win.
A minute into the first period, 
both teams were playing fast-
paced, with largely crisp passing. 
Then, senior forward Brendan 
Warren intercepted a pass at 
the blueline and had a clear 
breakaway. 
But 
Warren 
got 
walled by Minnesota goaltender 
Mat Robson right at the crease.
And before the Wolverines 
could catch their breath, it was 
the Gophers that got on the 
scoreboard after a streaking 
Brannon McManus went five-
hole on freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann.
Mann 
seemed 
to 
redeem 
himself three minutes later with a 
contorting, cross-body save with 
his right pad, but the rebound 
wasn’t 
cleaned 
up. 
Instead, 
Minnesota found the puck right at 
the top of the crease with Mann’s 
back turned and found the back of 
the net once again.
 “There’s a couple of shifts 
during the game where we seem 
like we’re all over the place in the 
zone,” said junior forward Nick 
Pastujov. “I think that’s where 
they get a lot of their chances.”

Then, 
7:43 
into 
the 
first 
period, freshman forward Nolan 
Moyle got a 2-on-0 breakaway 
opportunity 
with 
Pastujov, 
Michigan 
had 
another 
easy 
scoring opportunity. In Friday’s 
game, the game went to overtime 
because 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
inability to finish those point-
blank shots, and the trend seemed 
to be continuing.
With a flick of the wrist though, 
Moyle passed it to Pastujov, who 
went forehand, then backhand 
and slotted the puck into the five-
hole to give Michigan its first 
goal. Less than two minutes later, 
the Wolverines struck again from 
up close — as sophomore forward 
Michael Pastujov snaked around 
a scrum at the goal to equalize the 
game from behind the left post.
Though neither team scored 
for the next 16 minutes, the 
Wolverines 
found 
a 
rhythm 
offensively. After trading shots 
with 
Minnesota 
early 
on, 
Michigan went up 10 shots on 

the Gophers early in the second 
period. And by the end of it, the 
Wolverines eclipsed their per-
game average of 35.9 with 40 
shots and found themselves up 
3-2 thanks to a screamer from 
sophomore forward Josh Norris 
that flew into the top right of the 
goal from the left circle. For the 
game, they doubled the Gophers 
with 98 shot attempts to their 49.
 “We’ve outshot five of the last 
six games we’ve played in,” Norris 
said. We outshot them both times 
by a ton. It’s frustrating to not get 
a win after playing so well.”
But just as fast as Michigan 
seemed to be running away with 
the game, Minnesota created 
more chaos in the crease early in 
the third period. Though Mann 
again made a slew of saves in the 
shadow of Gophers defenders, 
Minnesota tied the score at 3-3 
by again taking advantage of 
Michigan’s inability to clear the 
puck.
The Wolverines seemed to 

have the equalizer on a scrum led 
by junior forward Will Lockwood 
late in the third period, but 
the goal was waved off due to 
interference. With Michigan’s 
momentum gone, the Gophers 
barreled in a shot with less than 
two minutes remaining.
 “We had what was it, 53 
shots?,” Norris said. “I think 
we did a good job there, but we 
need to do a better job of getting 
guys in front of the net. We had 
an unfortunate call at the end 
that might have been goalie 
interference … but if we start to 
(get in front of the net), more 
pucks will come our way.”
It wasn’t another overtime, 
but it was a familiar dread for the 
Wolverines — another tight loss 
against another team it outplayed 
for the majority of the game.
 “We’ve probably played well 
enough to win all these games,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. “Tonight more so than 
any of them.”

Offense struggles to convert 

Shots came easily, goals did not.
After last Saturday’s game 
against Michigan State, Michigan 
hockey 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
commented on his team’s recent 
lack of “puck luck” as a big reason 
for his team’s low conversion 
rate on offense. The bounces 
just weren’t going their way all 
weekend. Shots rattled off the pipe 
and trickled through the crease –– 
teasing the Wolverines.
Unfortunately for the Michigan 
hockey team (6-7-4 overall, 2-4-4-2 
Big Ten), that trend continued this 
weekend.
The Wolverines followed up 
Friday’s 
42-shot 
performance 
with 53 shots in Saturday’s 4-3 loss 
against Minnesota. Junior forward 
Nick Pastujov shared his team’s 
frustrations.
“We were right there on a lot 
of chances,” Pastujov said after 
Saturday’s game. “We just gotta 
finish those chances. I think the 
game could’ve been 7-2 our way.”
Michigan has been getting 
shots on net but has been unable to 
translate those shots into goals.
Despite 
outshooting 
their 
opponents in five of their last six 
games, the Wolverines have not 
emerged victorious in regulation 
during that span. The team’s last 
regulation win was in Happy 
Valley against Penn State on Nov. 
16.
During a second period power 
play for Michigan on Saturday, 
a scrum in front of the Gophers’ 
net led to a loose puck just in front 
of the crease. In the chaos that 
ensued, sophomore forward Jack 
Becker collected the loose puck. It 
appeared as though it would be a 
sure goal for the Wolverines with 
the goaltender out of position.
A score would give them a 
commanding 4-2 lead, but, instead, 
Becker’s shot hit a Minnesota 
defenseman who was on all 
fours in the crease. The Gophers 
went on to clear the puck, killing 
off the penalty and preserving 
the tie heading into the second 

intermission.
“We had a number of really good 
scoring opportunities and we don’t 
get it,” Pearson said after Saturday’s 
game. “Then it becomes a one-shot 
game. They go out and get a break 
or a rebound and then you’re tied. 
I think that’s really the story of the 
game and been the story the last 
three weeks. ... We’re making every 
goaltender look like they’re an All-
American right now.”
Collectively outshooting your 
opponent, 248-164, in your last 
six games while being outscored, 
12-14, will do that. The offense 
is generating chances by getting 
the puck in goal-scoring areas but 
finishing those chances continues 
to be a problem. And it is becoming 
a costly problem for Michigan, as 
Minnesota is now tied with the 
Wolverines for fourth in Big Ten 
standings despite having played 
two fewer conference games.
It is not for a lack of effort on 
the part of Michigan. It outplayed 
Michigan State two weekends 
ago and came away with only one 
point. This past weekend against 
Minnesota as well, shots depicted it 
the better team but the Wolverines 
left the weekend with just two 
points.
The level of parity in the Big Ten 
is keeping them afloat and within 
reaching distance of the top of the 
conference. A hot streak can rocket 
them to the top of the standings 
and secure them a spot in the 
NCAA Tournament. But failing to 
come out of a weekend with more 
than one or two points will keep 
them in the middle of the pack, or 
may even send Michigan to the 
bottom of the table.
Converting 
on 
its 
scoring 
opportunities will be a key to 
success in the second half of 
the season. The Wolverines are 
heading into the break in a similar 
spot as last season: hovering 
around a .500 record and plagued 
by inconsistent play.
“Not unlike last year at this 
time,” Pearson said about the state 
of the team. “Now, can we turn it 
on like we did? That’s the question 
that remains to be seen.”

Church, Munger lead Michigan to win

The first two of the Michigan 
women’s basketball team’s 85 
points came a minute into the 
game on a fast break layup by 
senior guard Nicole Munger. 
From then on, the Wolverines 
(7-3) never relinquished the lead 
cruising to an 85-59 victory over 
Oakland (2-8).
Munger, who led all Michigan 
players with 21 points, fueled a 
dominant first quarter for the 
Wolverines. She scored 11 of the 
team’s 27 first-quarter points on 
4-for-6 shooting, including a trio 
of 3-pointers.
However, Munger didn’t score 
in the second quarter. Instead, 
it was freshman forward Naz 
Hillmon 
who 
controlled 
the 
scoring, complimenting Munger’s 
high-scoring first quarter with a 
10-point quarter of her own. 
“I 
think 
Nicole’s 
playing 
with a tremendous amount of 
confidence,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico in a 
post-game interview. “Being a 
senior, her leadership role, her 
confidence (and) her experience 
(are) shining through and tonight 
was another example of that. I 
think her teammates are doing a 
great job now of really finding her 
and getting her some open shots, 
and she’s just able to knock them 
down. She’s prepared herself her 
whole life to make these shots, 
and I’m really proud of her having 
these opportunities.” 
While it was Munger and 
Hillmon who led the Wolverines 
in their scoring efforts, it was 
sophomore guard Deja Church 
who facilitated the offense and 
took charge on defense.
Church ended the game with a 
career-high nine assists, including 
seven in the first half, and was 
tasked with guarding the Golden 
Grizzlies’ leading scorer, guard 
Taylor Jones (15 points per game). 
Even though Jones did finish the 
game with 15 points, Barnes Arico 
was more focused on the fact that 
it took her 20 shots to get there.
“Deja 
Church 
was 
outstanding,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “I thought she had a great 
game on both the offensive and 
defensive ends. … So Deja really 

did a great job on the defensive 
end and then I think that sparked 
her offense. She ran point for us, 
the wing for us.
“She 
distributed 
the 
ball 
exceptionally well, she made 
some free throws, she made some 
shots. She just all-around had 
a great high energy and a great 
game. I was really happy for her.”
Yet, 
despite 
the 
overall 
dominant 
performance 
for 
Michigan, in which Munger, 
Hillmon and Church excelled, 
others struggled — specifically, 
freshman guard Amy Dilk and 
senior center Hallie Thome.
Dilk, who finished with a 1:1 
assist-to-turnover ratio and shot 
2-for-12 from the field, has hit 
just five of her last 31 shots and 
has an assist-to-turnover ratio 
of 16:13 during a frustrating last 
four games. Still, the freshman 
has shown flashes of why she was 
named Miss Basketball in Indiana 
last year after very promising 
performances 
against 
two 
formidable opponents, Texas and 
Washington, earlier this season.
“We have two big off-days 
right now, so I think it will be big 
for her to get back in the gym and 
take easy shots and be able to get a 

high volume of shots up,” Munger 
said. “That’s what I did and it 
seemed to help. I’ll definitely be 
in her ear because she’s a great 
listener and she just wants to get 
better. She’ll respond and she’ll be 
good.”
Thome, meanwhile, did not 
necessarily 
struggle 
against 
Oakland, but rather was unable 
to leave her mark on the game due 
to back spasms; she played just 12 
minutes and scored six points. 
Aside from the back spasms, 
though, Thome has been relatively 
quiet in her past few games. After 
taking at least nine shots in all but 
one of the Wolverines’ first six 
games, she has not reached that 
shot total in any of her last four.
“We work really well together,” 
Munger said. “We live together 
too, so we’re able to talk about 
(her struggles) whenever we need 
to. But Hallie will be fine. She had 
a really, really good workout. She 
knows what she needs to do, so 
she’s gotten back in the gym to get 
her touch back. She’ll be fine.”
Michigan will take on Morgan 
State on Saturday, Dec. 15 and 
play two more non-conference 
games before Big Ten play begins 
Dec. 28.

Michigan dominates Indiana, 32-7

Jackson 
Striggow 
has 
something to celebrate going 
into finals week. Entering the 
second period of his match tied 
2-2 in a defensive standoff, the 
redshirt junior left Sunday’s 
contest 
with 
both 
fists 
in 
the air, a smile 
across 
his 
face 
and 
an 
automatic 
win 

from a 15-point 
pin.
The Michigan 
wrestling team 
(3-0) dominated 
Indiana 
(2-3), 
32-7, in a contest 
riddled with bonus points, near 
falls and strong performances by 
several Wolverines. With high-
scoring wins from Striggow, 
fifth-year senior Malik Amine, 
redshirt junior Myles Amine 
and redshirt freshman Jelani 
Embree, Michigan will leave 
for the holidays with a big win 
and momentum for its next dual 
meet versus Illinois.
Starting 
the 
meet 
well, 
sophomore Drew Mattin and 
redshirt junior Stevan Micic 
delivered wins in the 125 and 
133-pound 
weight 
classes, 
respectively. 
Mattin, 
ranked 
tenth 
in 
his 
weight 
class 
nationally, and Micic, ranked 
second 
in 
the 
133-pound 
division, both faced unranked 
opponents.
With two clean wins and 
a six-point lead over Indiana, 
eighth-ranked 
redshirt 
sophomore Kanen Storr entered 
the only ranked matchup of the 
day versus 15th-ranked Cole 
Weaver, a fifth-year senior from 
Hudson, Mich. Both three-time 
Michigan high school state 
champions at 141 pounds, Storr 
and Weaver trained in the same 
gym in high school. But their 
familiarity didn’t faze Storr, he 
said.
After a scoreless defensive 
struggle in the first period, 
Storr delivered a key near 
fall, bringing the score to 2-1. 

Though Weaver escaped to 
his feet to earn a point, Storr 
responded with an escape in 
the third period, securing the 
win and a 9-0 team score for 
Michigan.
“There’s a little bit of pressure 
because he’s like an older 
brother figure to me: always 
trains 
with 
me, he’s older 
than 
me, 
he’s 
from Michigan, 
(three)-time 
state 
champ. 
I 
know 
he’s 
gonna be a great 
opponent,” 
Storr 
said. 
“I 
kind of had a 
down week, but 
overall, I came 
out here, I gutted out a win. I 
didn’t feel my best, so there’s a 
lot to be proud of there but a lot 
to build off of also.”
Following Storr’s close win, 
Malik Amine put on a booming 
performance in the 149-pound 
division, winning his match 
18-0 and generating a five-point 
technical fall for the Wolverines. 
Amine’s 
momentum 
largely 
manifested in the third period, 
when he pushed the score from 
4-0 to 18-0 with three four-
point near falls and one two-
point near fall.
Despite 
redshirt 
freshman Layne 
Van 
Anrooy’s 
loss in the 157-
pound 
weight 
class, 
seventh-
ranked redshirt 
junior 
Logan 
Massa 
quickly 
reestablished 
Michigan’s 
success and won his match 
at 165 pounds, ushering in 
another bonus-point win in the 
174-pound division by third-
ranked 
Myles 
Amine, 
who 
won 19-1 in the second period 
with three near falls and three 
takedowns. Combined, Malik 
and Myles Amine outscored 
their opponents 37-1 for the day.
Embree, ranked 19th, piled 
on that success, beating his 

opponent 
14-2 
in 
a 
major 
decision and increasing the 
Wolverines’ team score to 26-4.
Massa, Myles Amine and 
Embree’s successful outings, 
though, 
culminated 
in 
Striggow’s 197-pound matchup. 
After a difficult first period, 
tied 2-2, Striggow delivered a 
dramatic pin to win his match 
and drive the team score up 
further.
“I think some guys, including 
me especially, could’ve done a 
little better at the beginning 
coming out with a little more 
momentum, 
carrying 
the 
momentum from each match, 
but overall I think we had a 
pretty good day,” Striggow said. 
“I’ve kind of struggled in that 
position in a couple matches 
this year and it’s cost me one 
or two matches already, so I’ve 
really been working on it in the 
practice room and to finally get 
it, I was pretty pumped up to 
have it finally work out for me.”
Despite Indiana’s win in the 
final 
heavyweight 
matchup 
against 
redshirt 
freshman 
Luke 
Ready, 
Michigan 
still 
won the meet handily due to 
several standout matchups. The 
Wolverines 
emphasize 
those 
bonus-point wins, said Striggow, 
partially with a hammer trophy 
that one player 
earns each week 
by scoring the 
most 
points 
in 
that 
meet. 
Sunday, 
the 
contest 
was 
a 
tight one with 
multiple 
high-
scoring matches.
“I was super 
pleased with the 
way we wrestled 
on the mat,” said Michigan 
coach Sean Bormet. “After I 
congratulated those guys on a 
good performance today, the 
first thing we talked about as a 
staff was that it’s an important 
week to really dig in and focus 
on school work (and) rest, 
because we’re still gonna have a 
good, hard eight days of training 
ahead. We have some work to 
do.”

How John Beilein helped Mike Gansey realize his NBA dreams

Thanksgiving, 
2006. 
Basketball 
buzzed 
in 
the 
background, but for the first 
time in his life, Mike Gansey 
wasn’t 
interested.
He was at 
his parents’ 
house 
in 
Olmsted 
Falls, Ohio. 
A perfectly 
pleasant 
place, 
but 
Gansey was 
supposed 
to be on the 
other side of that television 
set — playing basketball, not 
watching it.
That’s where he had been a 
year earlier, a star at shooting 
guard 
for 
John 
Beilein’s 
West 
Virginia 
Mountaineers. 
He 
finished 
sixth 
in 
the 
Big 
East 
in 
scoring 
that 
year 
and 
was 
named 
to 
the 
all-conference 
team.
He 
arrived 
at West Virginia two years 
before that, as a transfer from 
St. Bonaventure. Gansey knew 
it was the right fit from the 
first time he met Beilein, on 
his initial visit to Morgantown. 
Beilein told him he could live 
with his son, Patrick, a guard 
for the Mountaineers at the 
time.
Except 
when 
Gansey 
arrived on campus in the fall 
of 2003, there had been a 
miscommunication. He wasn’t 
living with Patrick. Within a 
week, they became best friends 
anyway, 
bonding 
over 
the 
misery of their NFL teams — 
Gansey, a native Clevelander, 
is a lifelong Browns fan, while 
Patrick follows in his father’s 
footsteps as a Buffalo Bills fan.
“We had a ton of similarities,” 
Gansey told The Daily. “You 
know how it is when you meet 
someone and it just clicks, and 
you’re like, ‘Man.’ We knew 
we were gonna be best friends 
from there.”
“He’s part of our family,” 
John Beilein said of Gansey 
now, 15 years later. “He’s 
probably as close as any kid 
that any of our children have 
met as part of our family.”
Gansey had to sit out his 
first season, redshirting and 
learning Beilein’s system. The 
next year — now living with 
Patrick for real — he became 
a star. That March, his place 
in Mountaineer history was 
immortalized when he scored 
29 points in a double-overtime 
win over Chris Paul and Wake 
Forest in the second round of 
the NCAA Tournament and 
helped West Virginia make its 
first Elite Eight in 46 years.
It 
was 
all 
supposed 
to 

culminate 
in 
the 
summer 
of 2006, when Gansey was 
projected 
as 
a 
first-round 
pick in the NBA draft. When 
the Indiana Pacers selected 
Shawne Williams 17th overall, 
Gansey became the top player 
available on ESPN analyst Jay 
Bilas’ big board.
But Gansey knew that wasn’t 
going to come to fruition. 
During 
pre-draft 
workouts, 
he 
hadn’t 
been 
the 
same 
player that he was during the 
previous two seasons, and he 
ended up going undrafted. The 
Miami Heat signed him to their 
Summer League roster, but his 
fatigue persisted.
“When I played Summer 
League in Miami, I was in a 
lot of pain,” Gansey said. “But 
I just thought 
I 
was 
worn 
down more than 
anything.”
He 
fought 
through 
the 
pain, went back 
to Morgantown 
and hoped for a 
second crack at 
the NBA.
One 
day 
with 
summer 
winding down, he and Patrick 
convinced the elder Beilein 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
fleeting warmth and play a 
rare nine holes of golf. But 
after persuading Beilein to join 
them, it was Gansey who had 
to quit midway through the 
round.
“I couldn’t even sit in the 
golf cart,” Gansey said. “And I 
was just like, ‘Something’s not 
right.’
“The next day, I was like, ‘I 
gotta go home, I gotta go to the 
Cleveland Clinic, I gotta figure 
this thing out.’ ”
Doctors quickly confirmed 
Gansey’s suspicion, diagnosing 
him with MRSA, a severe staph 
infection. Over the next two 
months, he lost 30 pounds 
and spiraled into depression, 
unable to play basketball for 
the first time in his life.
“He was very quiet,” said 
his brother Steve, who now 
coaches the Fort Wayne Mad 
Ants of the NBA G League. “It 
was a tough time for him and it 
was a tough time for our entire 
family, including me. Just to 
see my brother work his butt 
off and do everything that he 
absolutely strived for and it 
just being taken away from him 
because of a staph infection, it 
was very unfortunate.”
Then came the call.
Beilein was on the other 
end, inviting Gansey to return 
to Morgantown and live with 
him and his wife, Kathleen, 
as he continued to recover. 
Gansey 
had 
remained 
in 
communication with Patrick 
throughout 
his 
sickness. 
When Beilein got word of the 
situation, taking him in was 
the natural thing to do.

“He needed to be around 
the type of environment of 
happiness and fun that we have 
in our family,” Beilein told The 
Daily.
Gansey views it differently.
“Coach doesn’t have to do 
that,” Gansey said. “It just 
shows who Coach is, that when 
I was in a really bad place and 
depressed and had nothing to 
do, nowhere to go, that he and 
Mrs. Beilein and Pat were just 
like, ‘Hey, why don’t you come 
live with us?’
“It’s just who he is. It’s not 
just for me. He would do that 
for anyone.”
***
Now 35 years old, married 
with three kids, Gansey has an 
NBA championship ring locked 
away 
in 
his 
house — almost 
as he dreamt it 
in the summer 
of ’06.
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that it came not 
as a player, but 
as a front office 
executive 
for 
the 
Cleveland 
Cavaliers’ 2016 
championship team. Both Mike 
and Steve Gansey use the same 
word to describe that night — 
unforgettable. Mike because he 
had realized a lifelong dream, 
Steve because his brother face-
timed 
him 
mid-celebration 
from the locker room with 
Jamie Foxx.

“Me being a Clevelander … it 
was a surreal moment,” Gansey 
said.
Gansey’s journey to that 
locker 
room 
in 
Oakland 
began in earnest nine years 
earlier, 
when 
he 
returned 
to Morgantown to live with 
the Beileins. After spending 
that winter working out with 
Patrick and running youth 
camps around the state, he 
regained enough strength to 
take another crack at Summer 
League, this time with the Los 
Angeles Clippers.
Again, Gansey was unable to 
secure an NBA roster spot, but 
his performances were enough 
to earn a contract in the Italian 
league. The next season, he 
moved 700 miles north to 
Bremerhaven, a 
drab port town 
in the north of 
Germany.
John 
and 
Patrick 
Beilein 
came over for a 
game that year, 
in 
the 
winter 
of 2009, as part 
of a European 
tour that took 
them 
to 
see 
three former players. Despite 
having spent the past decade 
in Ann Arbor, John still shivers 
at the memory of March in 
Bremerhaven. Unfazed, Gansey 
persevered in pursuit of his 
NBA dream, jumping from 
Germany to D League stints in 
Boise, Idaho and Erie, Penn., 

before returning to Europe for 
a season in Spain.
Each 
summer, 
he 
would 
come back to the U.S., visit the 
Beileins in Ann Arbor, and then 
go back to Cleveland. He turned 
some connections with the 
Cavaliers into an opportunity 
to workout with players who 
stayed in town for the summer, 
playing 5-on-5 and joining in 
lifting sessions.
“Mike was such a nice guy 
and did whatever they wanted 
him to do,” Steve said. “It was 
a free workout, that’s really 
tough to get.”
At the end of 2011, when 
Cleveland had an internship 
open up in its front office, those 
summers with the team — as 
well as the year in Erie with 
their G League 
affiliate — paid 
dividends.
But it wasn’t 
just 
Gansey’s 
connections. 
Steve 
recalls 
his 
brother’s 
encyclopedic 
knowledge 
of 
the 
league 
long before his 
first 
job 
with 
the Cavaliers. One year when 
Mike was overseas, he decided 
he 
was 
unsatisfied 
with 
traditional NCAA tournament 
brackets and conjured a fantasy 
league for a couple friends. 
Steve was originally skeptical, 
but that quickly changed once 
the tournament got underway.

“It was actually really fun,” 
Steve said. “And I was just like, 
‘Mike, you could definitely get 
into scouting and get into some 
basketball operations here.’ ”
Not long after his first job 
as an intern, Cleveland’s front 
office handed him the reins to 
Canton. Since then, it has been 
a rapid ascension to assistant 
GM, with his former coach by 
him every step of the way.
“I learned so much from 
(Beilein),” Gansey said. “Just 
how he approaches every single 
day, how he approaches his 
staff. ‘Cause he’s the leader, the 
head coach, I’m always asking 
his advice. And he always 
calls me. When LeBron left, he 
called me and said, ‘Hey, keep 
your head up.’ Just giving me 
some motivation 
and 
saying 
everything’s 
gonna be okay.
“He 
just 
cared. 
Little 
things like that 
that go a long 
way. And that’s 
just who he is.”
Now, 
when 
Gansey’s phone 
rings 
and 
the 
screen reads, ‘John Beilein,’ 
there’s nothing abnormal about 
it. Just two friends talking 
about basketball and family.
“He cares about you more 
as a person than a basketball 
player,” Gansey said. “He’s a 
basketball coach, but he’s more 
of a role model to me.”

Michigan begins preparation to face Florida in the Peach Bowl

Chase Winovich would have 
had every right to skip out on 
the Peach Bowl.
The 
fifth-year 
senior 
defensive 
end 
will 
enter 

the NFL Draft this spring, 
and 
many 
players 
with 
similar 
prospects 
choose 
to sit out bowls due to the 
risk of injury. It wouldn’t 
have been a surprise, and it 
would have been completely 
understandable, had Winovich 

done the same.
But when asked if he would 
play in the No. 7 Michigan 
football team’s game against 
No. 10 Florida on Dec. 29, 
Winovich cracked a smile.
“Totally.”
He elaborated: “(The Peach 

Bowl) is a great bowl game and 
it’s a huge opportunity. I think 
because it’s not as historic as 
the Rose and the Orange and 
so forth, I think it often … gets 
overlooked, but this is … a huge 
opportunity for the team. It’s a 
must-win game against Florida 
and it really will set the tone 
for next year, good or bad.”
Bowl 
games 
can 
often 
feel meaningless, a hollow 
consolation 
for 
not 
being 
good enough to make the 
College Football Playoff. In 
the Wolverines’ case, after 
falling 
short 
in 
the 
last 
game of the season against 
their biggest rival with a Big 
Ten 
Championship 
Game 
appearance 
on 
the 
line, 
it’s even more so. But with 
the way the season ended, 
there’s a sense of unfinished 
business. The only thing left 
to do is move forward, and a 
win against the Gators would 
allow Winovich to go out on a 
high note.
“I’ve had the most fun of 
my football career suiting up 
here at Michigan,” said junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson — 

who also confirmed he would 
play in the game and said he 
would be back to 100 percent 
after suffering minor injuries 
against 
Indiana 
and 
Ohio 
State. “It’s been such an honor 
to do it and I think there’s a 
lot more to be done, but like 
I said, I’m just so excited to 
get one more win and possibly 
finish top five in the country. I 
think that would be pretty big 
for us.”
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
very 
little 
about the loss in Columbus on 
Sunday following the team’s 
awards banquet. Instead, he 
praised his team for how it 
overcame adversity after a 
loss to Notre Dame to rattle 
off 10 straight wins and how 
it fought through an early 17-0 
deficit at Northwestern for a 
comeback victory.
But how the Wolverines 
respond to the loss to the 
Buckeyes is their biggest trial 
yet, and a win in Atlanta could 
do a lot to wash out some of the 
bad taste in Michigan’s mouth 
and set the tone for next year.
“(We) started our practices 

(Saturday) 
and 
continue 
(Monday),” Harbaugh said. “It 
… was better than any I can 
remember where there was a 
break, two weeks where the 
team came back sharp and 
good.”
And despite the crushing 
end to the regular season, 
there are still things to look 
forward to at the Peach Bowl. 
The pre-bowl festivities will 
include trips to the College 
Football Hall of Fame and the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Center, 
a competition for a WWE-
style belt in the Battle for 
Bowl Week and service with 
kids from a local children’s 
hospital. And the Wolverines 
still have a goal to focus on: 
getting to 11 wins for just the 
10th time in program history.
“Getting our team prepared 
to play a really good, uber-
talented 
and 
twitched-up 
team like Florida, I’d say that’s 
a great challenge,” Harbaugh 
said. 
“The 
competition’s 
always the best part and the 
objective’s 
always 
to 
win. 
(We’re) hungry for that 11th 
win.”

John Beilein took his former player in when he was at his lowest point and helped turn his life around.

Michigan coach John Beilein has a unique relationship with Mike Gansey, the assistant general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who played under Beilein.

“It’s not just 
for me. He’d 
do that for 
anyone.”

“He’s a 
basketball 
coach, but he’s a 
role model...” 

“...I just thought 
I was worn 
down more 
than anything.”
