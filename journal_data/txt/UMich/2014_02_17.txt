Body-Peace Corps
creates Eating
Disorder Week to
raise awareness
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
The Body-Peace Corps, a
student-run organization,
along with MBody and
University Health Services,
kicked off this year's Eating
Disorder Awareness Week
with a Valentine's Day-themed
event on the Diag Friday, and a
Twitter campaign Sunday.
The campaign for awareness
comes a week before National
Eating Disorder Awareness
Week, which is Feb. 23 to March
1. It also falls during a larger
month-long push - February
is Eating Disorders Awareness
Month.
On campus, the week has

been held consistently for the
past decade, though its sponsors
have changed from year to year.
In the past, it's been run through
Counseling and Psychological
Services and the University.
LSA sophomore India
Peterson, Body-Peace Corps
event chair, said the week is
necessary at the University
because it helps remove some of
the stigma surrounding eating
disorders and helps students
form more positive body images.
"It's really important because
a lot of people have the wrong
view of eating disorders and
they don't know all the facts,"
Peterson said. "It'sjust important
to promote positive body image
beyause I know that especially
with the media, especially on
college campuses, a lot of people
struggle with having a positive
image."
The Valentine's Day event,
called "Trash Your Trash Talk,"
was sponsored in .partnership

BUSINESS
3D printing
business opens
in Ann Arbor

Local store to
appeal to needs of
residents, students
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Most 3D printing businesses
cater to engineers, hobbyists and
other tech-savvy folks with thick
wallets. However, this is not
the case at the recently opened
Thingsmiths.
Owner Owen Tien said he
opened the State Street business
last month to cater to anyone
with an interest in 3D printing.
"It doesn't matter if it's
sketched on a napkin," Tien said.
"We'll do our best to make sure
it's good for our customer."
Napkin-sourced designs are
not hypothetical. Art & Design
sophomore Rachel Snyder, who
assists with 3D modeling at
Thingsmiths, said she recently
helped a customer produce his
napkin schemes in two weeks.
"I find it actually really
exciting," Snyder said. "I think
the big' responsibility that I

have as a designer is to make
someone's creative idea a reality
and help them make exactly what
they wanted, exactly what they
envisioned."
Few 3D printing stores exist to
serve the average consumer. Even
fewer exist in brick-and-mortar
forms.
Thingsmiths fulfills both
of those rarities. Thingsmiths
opened last month and joined
what Tien estimated to be fewer
than 50 physical 3D printing
shops in the United States.
Tien said the Ann Arbor
location was ideal for attracting
tech-aware customers. He also
considered Bloomfield Hills
and Grand Rapids as potential
locations.
Most 3D printing shops are
online. They won't explain how
the 3D printing process works,
how to submit your ideas in the
requisite computer-aided design
format or a host of other techie
complications. There are barriers
for the Average Joe to explore
the much-hyped world of 3D
printing.

Michigan Yellow Cards replaced

40 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(FEB. 21,1974)
After a vote among graduate
students defeated a call to strike
sponsored by the Graduate,
Employees' Organization, the
group elected to seek recognition
as a union representing teaching
fellows, research assistants and
staff assistants.
The strike was intended to
help GEO members negotiate
with the University on financial
and fringe benefits for graduate
student instructors. The GEO's
conversion to a union ensured
recognition the Michigan
Employment Relations
Commission and permit'
negotiations with the University.

24 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK 10 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(FEB.21,1990) (Feb. 20, 2004)

The University began issuing
non-transferable photo IDs
that also served as real cards.
The new system served as a
response to a number of problems
with University yellow cards,
including the problem of theft.
The new cards were modeled
after yellow cards and combined
the functions of those used in
the College of Engineering and
the Ross School of Business. The
cards included a magnetic strip
that allowed students to purchase
meals in dining halls, check out
books from the library and enter
laboratories and other University
facilities.

Supporters of the Lecturers'
Employee Organization
rallied in front of the Fleming
Administration Building
before the weekly scheduled
University's Board of Regents
meeting of the week.
The rally's goal was to
highlight support for increased
benefits and job security for
non-tenure track faculty at the
University. Other concerns
included higher wages and
increased representation in
University policy-making.

Recent Florida verdict
revisits self-defence issue

Like Zimmerman,
Dunn is charged
with the murder of a
black teen
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -
A verdict in the city of Jackson-
ville is again raising the issue of
self-defense and race in Florida,
just seven months after George
Zimmerman was acquitted in
the shooting of a black teenager,
Trayvon Martin.
Michael Dunn, a white
47-year-old software developer,
could face 60 years in prison
following his conviction
Saturday on multiple counts of
attempted murder for shooting
into a carful of teenagers outside
a Jacksonville convenience store
in 2012. Jordan Davis, a black
17 year old, was killed in the
shooting, but the jury couldn't
reach a verdict on the first-
degree murder charge against
Dunn. A mistrial was declared on

that count.

Judge Russell L. Healey could
impose a 60-year sentence -
state statutes call for a mandatory
minimum sentence of 20 years on
each second-degree attempted
murder conviction.
But the Florida Supreme Court
could reduce the total sentence
to 20 years if it decides that
consecutive sentences are not
appropriate when the sentences
arise from one criminal episode,
said Weinstein.

Eruption debris is
used as a valuable
construction
addititive
SIDOMULYO, Indonesia (AP)
- The ash and debris that Indo-
nesia's Mount Kelud blasted from
its belly brought death and mis-
ery, and disrupted international
air traffic. But for many of the mil-
lions of people cleaning up in the
wake of the explosive eruption,
it was also a money earner and a
shot of life for their crops.
"This is a blessing of the
disaster," said Imam Choiri, a
farmer who was scraping up
the ash from the road to use as
fertilizer on his small vegetable
plot a few kilometers from the
crater of the rumbling mountain.
Choiri said locals believe the ash
helps drive away pests from crops.
The eruption of the 1,731-meter
(5,680-foot) -high mountain on
Java island late Thursday was
one of the most dramatic to hit
Indonesia in recent years, with
ash falling as far as 600 kilometers
(370 miles) away.,
Four people, including a
97-year-old woman, were killed
when the roofs of their homes

caved in under the weight of ash.
More than 100,000 people were
evacuated to temporary shelters.
On Saturday, scientists said
Kelud's activities were dying
down, in line with its reputation
as a mountain that blows its top
dramatically but then quickly
settles down for another 10 years
or so. But authorities warned
that water from its crater, along
with rain, could bring deadly
landslides of fresh ash and rocks
down river beds into villages and
valleys.
Army troops enforced a
ban on people returning to
houses within 10 kilometers
(6 miles) of the volcano, but
many people sneaked back to
check on livestock and clean up.
Authorities were finding it hard
to prevent people from returning,
given the money farmers stand
to lose by staying away, and said
about 56,000 people remained in
89 shelters.
"Our cows need to be milked.
If they aren't, they can get sick
and die," said Marjito, who was
riding on a motorbike with his
wife to his village around 5 kilo-
meters (3 miles) from the crater.
"We have so much work to do,
including running and hiding
from security officers," said his
wife, Dinayah. Like.many Indo-
nesians, both go by a single name.

Volcanic ash and debris are
also prized in the building
industry because they make
especially strong cement, and
sand diggers can charge almost
twice as much per load than they
can for regular sand. Scores of
diggers were collecting the fresh,
easy-to-dig sand, packing the
windfall into bags or onto trucks.
"Kelud is a valuable source of
livelihood to me and my family,"
Harjito Huda, a sand miner from
Ngancar village, said.
Transportation Ministry
spokesman Bambang Ervan said
that the Juanda international
airport in the country's second-
largest city, Surabaya, resumed
operation late Saturday along
with three others in Malang,
Semarang and Cilacap.
A total of seven airports on
Java - Indonesia's most densely
populated island and home to
more than half of the country's
240 million people - had been
closed because of ash on the
runway and on planes.
Three other airports in
Bandung, Solo and Yogyakarta
are scheduled to reopen later
Sunday or Tuesday at the
latest, Ervan said. The Darwin,
Australia-based Volcanic Ash
Advisory Center informed that
the conditions in Indonesia are
safe for airlines, he said.

graduation. Michigan legislators should work to pass SMART because it
provides a more reasonable approach to paying student loans and could
make college more accessible.

The failure of emergency management

SMART will begin as a five-year pilot
program with $2 million of loan funding. The
loans will be given to 200 in-state students
whose adjusted gross income is less than
$250,000. Half of the students awarded would
attend an in-state public university, while the
other half would attend an in-state community
college. if more than 200 eligible students
apply, then students will be randomly chosen
out of a lottery. Loans will not exceed the cost
of tuition. For every year a student receives
the loan, they will have to pay back five years'
worth of payments. If the student went to a
community college, they wit have to pay 2
percent of their adjusted gross income, while a
public university student wottld pay 4 percent.
Community college students can't take out
more than three years' worth of loans, and
public university students can't take out more
than five. Since these rates are fixed, and the
repayments stop after 15 or 25 years depending
on the school type, this means some students
would pay less than they took out, and others
would pay more, depending on their post-
graduation income. The program requires that
all awarded students must maintain at least
a 2.5 grade point average, which ensures that
students spend their time in classes instead of
juggling multiple jobs.
This forward-thinking plan will benefit
college students and the state economy because
it prevents lifelong debt by cappingthe number
ofyears a student will have to pay backthe state.
As of 2013, 62 percent of Michigan students
graduated with an average amount of $28,840
in debt. This becomes even more problematic

for students who continue their education, or
have a reasonable gap between graduation and
their first job. Unlike normal loans, repayments
for this loan will start once the student starts a
job and earns an adjusted gross income above
the federal poverty level. This makes it much
more feasible for a recent graduate to pay back a
large sum of money right after they enter their
first full-time job.
College could become more accessible to
lower-income students with this program, and
has proven to do so in other countries. With a
degree, students will be able to go into higher-
paying fields and pay back into the system,
making it self-sustaining over time. Countries
like the United Kingdom and Australia have
student repayment programs in place for their
entire country. In Australia, the payment
repayment program has been very successful,
as "it has financed expanded access to higher
education, contained tuition subsidy costs to
taxpayers and managed risk for students and
graduates. There is no such thing as student
loan default in Australia."
Students should not be discouraged from
obtaining a college education because of the
price. Michigan should pass this proposal
while putting forward even more legislation
that makes college more accessible and less
of a debt trap. While the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act passed under
Obama's administration has the ability to help
many students and control student debt, state
legislators need to do their part to provide
their students with more opportunities for an
affordable college education.

Highland Park, seems inevitable.
So how do we make emergency
managers under Public Act 436 more
accountable to citizens' long-term
benefit? Fortunately, barriers to
improvingthe existinglaw are simple.
For one, locally elected officials
should have more say in their
emergency manager appointment -
increasing the likelihood of creating
a positive working relationship with
local officials. Along those lines, it
might be more palatable at times
to temporarily grant local mayors
themselves - still responsible to
voters - with the powers of financial
managers. As Majewski pointed out,
emergency managers oftentimes
have never run a city.
Second, the governor needs to
mandate regular reporting to local
officials - entirely nonexistent
currently - to facilitate some level of
mentorship and a smooth transition
back to local government.
"One would hope that the
emergency manager would be
workingtoward aseamlesstransition
- so that when she walks out the
door, you're already up and rolling,"
Majewski said. "But that doesn't
have to happen. ... We could do such
a better job if we were informed and
partof the decision-making process."
And shouldn't that be the
point? Ultimately local control
will be restored, ideally on better
fiscal footing. Anything less is an
unquestionable affrontto democracy.
But even that's been uncertain
at times. In Pontiac, for example,
emergency management ended last
August, but oversight persisted from
the "receivership-transition advisory
board" with the authority to approve
all municipal contracts, hiring and
spending. One member of that board
is Pontiac's former antagonistic
emergency manager Louis Schimmel.
Critics contend that this consti-
tutes nothing more than continued
state control - without the supposed
legitimacy of financial emergency.
But what are our alternatives?
Peck and Majewski think they have
the answer.
Bailout.
And though the word has developed
a negative connotation in our lexicon,
we previously used other words to
describe the same phenomenon -
revenue-sharingkey amongthem.
"Our revenue-sharing has been
cut to the degree that the narrative
now has become absolutely one of
bailout," Majewski said at Peck's
presentation. "Promises that were
made to municipalities decades
ago and then slowly clawed back
- there's no recognition that those
promises were ever made. Now
in order for us to reclaim those
promises, we're coming begging and
our requests are delegitimized."
"The austerity is the new norm."

Pathos for philanthropy

THE UNITED COALITION FOR RACIAL JUSTICE
No more excuses

"Sign up for the bone marrow registry, it
only takes five minutes!" For a week I stood
eagerly beside Be The Match's table in Mason
Hall promoting the organization's bone
marrow registry. As people walked by, some
smiled, most ignored me and some shuddered
at the misconceived notion that I was going
to strap them down and give them a spinal
tap. Most people don't know what our bone
marrow registry is or are stuck on false
misinterpretations about it from watching
too much "House" or "Grey's Anatomy."
When students approach the table, I tell them
that bone marrow transplants are potential
lifesavers for people with leukemia, lymphoma
or other blood-borne diseases, used often as a
last resort. Registering is as simple as filling
out a form and having a quick cheek swab, and
the information is saved on a database until
you are 61 years old. If they find that you are
a match, which is pretty rare, there is a new
donating procedure that is just as easy as giving
blood, used far more frequently nowadays.
Even people familiar with bone marrow will
be surprised about how easy and painless new
technology has made donating.
I find that because of this new technology,
registering for, and if possible, donating
bone marrow, is the easiest way to help save
someone's life. However, in order to have
someone sign up and help, they have to
feel emotionally drawn to the cause. They
have to hear someone's story or feel the
grave importance of signing up. To expand
the registry, we rely on our most effective
technique: education. Once people hear about
the new procedure, they are likely to sign up,
but getting them to listen to my spiel remains
difficult. Recently, Michigan won a battle
against Ohio State University by signing up
more people for the registry. We collected
300 names and though this is an amazing
victory, the number could be so much higher.
Education and raising awareness comes
with its own challenges of being active and
assertive in public. During the drives, I feel

like a saleswoman, reading the body language
of the listener and knowing what to say to
make them feel the importance of the cause.
I thrive off the rush when someone signs up,
knowing I've made a tangible difference. It
feels even better when someone comes to the
table to inform me that they've been called to
be someone's match.
Volunteering through education doesn't
feel like raising money, where the donor often
doesn't know exactly where their money
is going or how it will be used. Of course,
fundraising is an excellent way to make a
difference - nothing would advance without
a financial push - but talking with people
from the community is a more direct effort to
help those in need. Personally, I feel invested
in a cause once I know more about it. Through
education, I realize the potential to make a
direct impact on someone else's life. It is a
different type of commitment than merely
buying a cookie at a bake sale and forgetting
about the cause 10 minutes later. Bone marrow
registry members turn off their apathy and
invest themselves in knowledge. Because
they stop to listen, they become larger than a
dollar in a cash box - they strengthen their
empathetic fibers for the good of humanity.
Every swab increases the chance of saving
someone's life and, because finding a match is
so rare, there is a potential for a special, deep
connection with the possible recipient.
Education doesn't only come through
standing at a table and being aggressive to
passersby. Next semester we are planning on
havingapanel discussion andbringingspeakers
who have donated or received donations. We
are also planning to possibly reach out to high
school students so people can be aware from
an earlier age. There are so many creative ways
in which to spread awareness. You just have
to be creative enough to get people to listen.
Education is the gateway to developing passion
and getting those philanthropic results.

Quick! When was the last time
that the University of Michigan had a
10-percent Black student enrollment?
That was a trick question:
the answer is "never." But many
may answer "before Proposal 2,"
which reflects the mainstream
University narrative on the current
crisis in minority enrollment. The
Proposal 2 narrative champions
the University and attributes major
setbacks in minority recruitment
to the passing of the 2006 ballot
initiative, which effectively banned
race-based affirmative action in
Michigan public institutions.
For example, according to a recent
article on the #BBUM demands,
President Coleman claimed that the
administration has "both hands tied
behind(its)back"andwill"waitforthe
Supreme Court." Proposal 2 has acted
as an excuse for the administration to
shield its poor record on diversity.
This narrative paints the
administration as hamstrung by law
and therefore unable to successfully
create a diverse and inclusive campus.
It spotlights the University's Supreme
Court affirmative action cases to
portray the University as a leader in
diversity rather than a place which
has consistently lagged behind its
so-called "peer institutions."
Thus, this narrative depicts
decreased minority enrollment as a
new problem rather than a historical
and enduring reality.
What has been framed as a singular
cause and effect is actually a longer,
two-part process: an initial drop
in enrollment of underrepresented
minorities from 1997-2006 and a
second decline from the time of
Proposal 2 to the present. While Black
enrollment did drop significantly in

the years immediately after Proposal
2 - from nearly 7 percent to under 5
percent in 2010, where it has remained
ever since - it was preceded by an
extenuated drop intheyears prior.
When President Bollinger arrived,
Black enrollment under former
President Duderstadt's Michigan
Mandate had reached an institutional
high of nearly 9 percent. This was the
closest Michigan has ever come to the
elusive 10 percentdemand ofthe Black
Action Movement in 1970.
But asthe institutional commitment
to diversity waned, minority
enrollment followed suit.
As Proposal 2 came into effect, the
nearly 9 percent high point of 1996
had already droppedtof6.8 percentin
2007, suggesting that changes before
the implementation of Proposal 2
caused this initial drop. Since then,
the University has proclaimed itself
a warrior for affirmative action: In
Provost Pollack's university-wide
e-mail, she reiteratedthat"Michigan
has a proud history of fighting for
social justice, including taking the
fight to promote diversity all the
way to the U.S. Supreme Court." But
again, this relies on the nearsighted,
myopic view.
There are ways in which
Proposal 2 has had devastating
effects on underrepresented
minority enrollment.
Latin@ enrollment has been a
neglected topic because enrollment
numbers have not noticeably dropped.
However, its steadiness appears less
reassuringwhenwe take Latin@ state
and national population growth into
account. Between 2000 and 2010,
Michigan's population remained
relatively constant, while the Latin@
population in the state grew nearly

35 percent. Yet that rise has yet to be
reflected in admissions figures.
Perhaps the most silenced narrative
of all is the one regarding Native
American enrollment,whereProposal
2's effects are most devastating. In
2009, 254 Native American students
were enrolled at the University, a
number that would face a 71-percent
decrease over the three following
years. In 2006, Native Americans
comprised 1 percent of the total
enrollment, 0.7 percent in 2009, and
a mere 0.2 percent ever since 2010. As
bothoftheseexamplesshow,Proposal
2 did have devastating effects on all
underrepresented minorities, a side of
the story that is often obscured by the
mainstreamnarrative.
Immediately after the passage of
Proposal2in2006,President Coleman
assured the 2,000 activists gathered
on the Diag: "I will do everything
that's legal to help us attract minority
students. But it's already having a
chilling effect."
In reality, that "chill" was nearly a
decade old then, and now approaches
two decades.
So when Provost Martha Pollack
admitted that the "percentage of
underrepresentedminoritystudents
on campus has fallen noticeably
in the last few years," we must ask
ourselves: "Are they recycling the
old Proposal 2 narrative of recent
decline and a willing, but hampered,
administration?" It has been nearly
20 years since the University made
a true institutional commitment
to diversity. It is time to move
beyond equivocations.

PRINTING
From Page 1A
should be a process where
someone with no experience with
3D printing or no experience with
the CAD stuff could walk in and
have a conversation with someone
and discuss what they want to
have," Tien said.
Located on State Street,
Thingsmiths is in a small room
above Five Guys. Printed objects
sit on shelves around the room
- a multicolored rocket, a tiny,
detailed Eiffel Tower and even
a small bust of a Thingsmiths
volunteer. With aprinterrunning,
the smell of a glue gun lingers and
it sounds vaguely like a Clinton-
era Ethernet connection.

Those printers, Tien said, are
similar to industrial models -
minus a few hundred thousand
dollars. Nevertheless, he said the
printers have 90 percent of the
capability of the arm-and-a-leg
ones.
"A lot of it is a difference
in volume and a difference in
precision," Tien said. "If you're
prototyping an automotive
engine, you need the accuracy
to be down to 10 microns and
you need to be able to print a
250-pound piece. The average
consumer is not gonna do that."
The low-cost printers allow
the products to remain relatively
cheap. For instance, a custom-
built iPhone case costs about $10.
That's one thing the average
customer might like from a 3D

printer. Custom-made cookie
cutters, jewelry and figurines are
other options. Most prominent
is the potential 3D printers have
for fixing or tinkering with
household objects. Tien said
custom-made fixes for a broken
or off-kilter object is where he
sees 3D printing integrating itself
most prominently in the typical
consumer's life.
"The end target is the average
person on the street," Tien said.
"They'll say, 'I broke this part, I
need it fixed by tomorrow. I could
order it through Amazon and
maybe have it in a day, or I could
have it in an hour."'
Synder added that 3D printing
could help eliminate the custom
of tossing broken objects. Along
with making it easier to fix broken

objects, Synder said 3D printing
can make objects more personal-
ized, more sentimental and more
likely to not end up in America's
growing landfills.
"You can throw away your
blender because it's a blender,"
Synder said. "It doesn't work,
why would you fix it? But you'd
never throw away that treasured
stuffed animal."
Allowing people to select
their color and monogram their
products will ensure they will
hold on to them, which is possible
with 3D printed products.
"Creatingmore personalization
in the manufacturing business,
getting people to be really
attached to their appliances or
new technology, they're gonna
wanna fix them more often

instead of just throwing them
away," Snyder said. "3D modelling
offers a really new exciting
possibility in that field because
you can personalize products."
However, 3D printing is still
relatively unknown. That lack of
awareness, Tien said, is his busi-
ness' key issue. He said he became
interested in it in his early adult-
hood, during his college years at
Grand Valley State University and
running a coffee shop in Midland.
"I mean it is cool, right?" Tien
said. "I'll be honest, I like shiny
new things. I just am one of those
people."
He chuckled and added that he
was also inspired by Robohand, a
3D-printed medical advancement
that's helped over 200 people
globally.

"It's one of those great exam-
ples where the average guy has a
problem, collaborates with some-
one across the world online and
comes up with a solution that's
being spread around the world
and actually helping people," Tien
said. "It's hard not to fall in love
with that sort of narrative."
That echoes the story that
Snyder has seen in her time at
Thingsmiths. She said 3D printing
is enabling people who lack
manufacturing or design training
like her and her peers.
"I think to some extent every
person is a creator is a designer,"
Snyder said. "Realizing that we
all have that responsibility and
thinking of smarter solutions
working with everyone can really
make that difference."

Snake-handling pastor
dies from reptile bite

Man refused
medical treatment
after bitten during
church service
MIDDLESBORO, Ky. (AP) -
Jamie Coots, a snake-handling
Kentucky pastor who appeared
on the National Geographic
television reality show "Snake
Salvation," died Saturday after
being bitten by a snake.
Coots was handling a
rattlesnake during a Saturday
night service at his Full Gospel
TabernacleinJesus Name Church
in Middlesboro when he was bit,
-another preacher, Cody Winn,
told WBIR-TV.
"Jamie went across the floor.
He had one of the rattlers in his
hand, he came over and he was
standing beside me. It was plain
view, it just turned its head and
bit him in the back of the hand ...
within a second," Winn said.
When an amhilance arrived at

the church at 8:30 p.m., they were
told Coots had gone home, the
Middlesboro Police Department
said in a news release. Contacted
at his house, Coots refused medi-
cal treatment.

9:10 p.m. When they returned
about an hour later, Coots was
dead from a venomous snake bite,
police said.
In January 2013, Coots was
caught transporting three
rattlesnakes and two copperheads
through Knoxville, Tenn.
Wildlife officials confiscated the
snakes, and Coots pleaded guilty
to illegally wildlife possession.
He was given one year of
unsupervised probation.
Coots said then he needed
the snakes for religious reasons,
citing a Bible passage in the book
of Mark that reads, in part: "And
these signs shall follow them that
believe; In my name shall they
cast out devils; they shall speak
with new tongues; They shall
take up serpents; and if they drink

any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
them; they shall lay hands on the
sick, and they shall recover."
Coots said he took the passage
at face value.
"We literally believe they want
us to take up snakes," Coots told
The Associated Press in February
2013. "We've been serpent han-
dling for the past 20 or 21 years."
After he was bitten Saturday
night, Coots dropped the snakes, but
then picked them back up and con-
tinued on. Within minutes, Winn
said Coots headed to the bathroom.
His son, Cody, told the
television station his dad had been
bit eight times before, but never
had such a severe reaction. Cody
Coots said he thought the bite
would be just like all the others.
"We're going to go home, he's
going to lay on the couch, he's
going to hurt, he's going to pray for
a while and he's going to get better.
That's what happened every other
time, except this time was just so
quick and it was crazy, it was really
crazy," Cody Coots said.

Four South Korean tourists
killed in Sinai bus bombing

First visitor attack
in a decade may be
linked to al-Qaida
CAIRO (AP) - An explosion
tore through a bus filled with
South Korean sightseers in the
Sinai Peninsula on Sunday, killing
at least four people and raising
fears that Islamic militants have
renewed a bloody campaign to
wreck Egypt's tourism industry.
The bombing near the tip of
the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba was
the first attack against tourists in
Sinai in nearly a decade.
There was no immediate claim
of responsibility. But the blast
bore the hallmarks of attacks
blamed on the al-Qaida-linked
militant groups that have been
battling government forces in
Sinai's restive north for years.

At least three South Korean
tourists were killed and 12
seriously wounded, according to
Egyptian security officials. The
Egyptian bus driver was also
among the dead, the officials said.
"I am deeply saddened by the
incident," Tourism Minister
Hesham Zazou told state TV.
The Egyptian presidency called
the attack a "despicable act of
cowardice" and vowed to bring
the culprits to justice.
Egypt's vital tourism sector,
which normally accounts for about
11 percent of the economy and 20
percent of all foreign currency
revenue, has been badly hit by the
deadly turmoil that has roiled the
country since the 2011 revolt that
overthrew ruler Hosni Mubarak.
Sunday's blast came as signs of a
slow recovery in the industry were
emerging, especially at Red Sea
resorts in Sinailike Sharm el-Sheik.

"The sad consequence for
Egypt is that this takes the
tourism industry and devastates it
for years into the future," said Jon
Alterman, director of the Middle
East Program at the Center
for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
Egyptian security officials said
they believe the blast was caused
by either a car bomb or a roadside
bomb that was detonated by
remote control.
Rescue workers found the
remains of four and perhaps five
people, according to Khaled Abu
Hashem, the head of ambulance
services in southern Sinai.
In Seoul, the foreign ministry
said in a text message that 31
passengers from a church in
Jincheon were being led by a
South Korean tour guide. Two of
its citizens were killed and nine
wounded, the ministry added.

Abass said he
doesn't want Israel
overwhelmed
RAMALLAH, West Bank
(AP) - The Palestinian president
on Sunday reassured a group of
young Israeli activists visiting
his West Bank compound that
he has no intention of flooding
Israel with Palestinian refugees
- his most ambitious attempt
yet to directly influence Israeli
public opinion over the heads
of a largely hard-line Israeli
leadership.
President Mahmoud Abbas
made a series of conciliatory
statements on some of the most
sensitive issues in peace talks,
including alleged Palestinian
incitement against Israel and
recognition of Jewish suffering
in the Holocaust, as he sought
to rally support for U.S.-backed
peace efforts.
Abbas delivered his message at
a sensitive time in the peace talks.
The sides have been conducting
behind-the-scenes negotiations
for nearly seven months. With
an April target date approaching,
there have been no signs of
progress. The talks have been
marred by finger pointing, with
both sides accusing each other of
hindering the negotiations with

rigid demands.
Speaking to some 300 Israeli
university students and activists,
Abbas signaled new flexibility
in one of the thorniest issues
of the conflict: Palestinian
refugees' "right of return" to lost
properties in what is now Israel.
"I am not looking to drown
Israel with millions of refugees
to change its nature," Abbas said.
"We want to put the problem on
the table and find a creative solu-
tion... you will be satisfied and we
will be satisfied."
The fate of the Palestinian
refugees is one of the most
emotional issues in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
Some 700,000 Palestinians
either fled or were expelled from
their homes during the war sur-
rounding Israel's establishment
in 1948. Today, the number of
refugees and their descendants
number about 5 million people,
spread mostly throughout the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and neigh-
boring Arab countries.
In Israel, there is a broad
consensus against accepting a
large-scale resettling of these
refugees in any future peace deal,
fearing they would dilute Israel's
Jewish character.
Israeli leaders have long
demanded that the Palestinian
leadership publicly renounce the
right of return, and say refugees
should be resettled in a future
Palestinian state or offered
compensation.
In Palestinian society, though,
there is an overwhelming
demand for refugees to be able
to return home. Abbas is himself
is a refugee from what is now
Safed in northern Israel, though
he has said he has no intention of
seekingto live there.
The refugee issue is one of the
Palestinians' most important
cards in the peace talks, and
something that is unlikely to be
addressed until the final stage of
negotiations.
Taysir Nasrallah, the head
of a committee representing
Palestinian refugees, said "no
one can concede" their rights
and said Abbas' comments were
politically motivated. "We will
retain these rights no matter how
long it would take us to achieve
them," he said.
Kerry is expected back in
the region in the coming weeks
with a proposed outline of a final
peace deal. By hosting the Israeli
delegation, Abbaswasattempting
to reach out to the Israeli public,
where skepticism about reaching
an agreement remains high.
Sitting in front of a large
poster of a dove soaring over the
ancient walled city of Jerusalem
with a Palestinian flag attached
to its wings, Abbas ran through
a list of oft-repeated Israeli max-
ims questioningthe Palestinians'
readiness to make peace.
Addressing a common Israeli
notion that the Palestinian leader
speaks moderately to Israelis
and foreign leaders but takes
a tougher tone with his own
people, Abbas said, "We don't
have two languages. We speak in
one language. we have nothing to
hide."
As for the common saying by
Israeli leaders that the country
does not have a true partner for
peace, Abbas said, "I am your
partner."
Israeli leaders often accuse

the Palestinians of promoting
incitement and hatred in
textbooks and official media.
"This is true. It exists," Abbas

said regarding incitement,
without elaborating as to what
kind.
But he said Israel refused an
offer to establish a joint commit-
tee with the Palestinians and the
U.S. to address incitement in both
Israeli and Palestinian societies.
Abbas seeks the West Bank,
east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip
- territories captured by Israel
in 1967 - for a Palestinian state
alongside Israel. He has said
he would be willing to alter the
border with "land swaps" to
allow Israel to keep some of the
Jewish settlements it has built.
Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wants to
retain parts of the West Bank
and opposes any division of east
Jerusalem, home to sensitive
religious sites. Israel withdrew
from Gaza in 2005, and Hamas
militants subsequently seized
control of the area.
The Hamas takeover, which
was followed by years of rocket
attacks on Israel, has raised fears
that the West Bank could follow a
similar path if Israel withdraws.
Abbas said Palestinians seek
a demilitarized state, which
he said proves Palestinians do
not seek violence with Israel.
He also rejected claims that a
book he published in the 1980s
denied the Holocaust. "I know
millions of Jews were killed in
the Holocaust," he said.
While claiming east
Jerusalem as the Palestinian
capital, Abbas said he wants it
to function alongside Israel's
capital, keeping Jerusalem as
one undivided city. "What is
the problem with that? This is
coexistence," Abbas said.
As for claims in Israel that he
rejected a generous peace offer
from former Israeli Prime Min-
ister Ehud Olmert in 2008,Abbas
said peace talks fell through
because "Olmert fell" out of
power. Olmert resigned amid
corruption allegations. "We had
to go back to square one," he said.
In a question and answer ses-
sion, Israelis asked repeatedly if
he would be willing to recognize
Israel as a Jewish state, one of
Netanyahu's key demands.
Abbas has rejected the
demand, saying it would
undercut the rights of refugees
and Israel's own Arab minority.
But he said if Israel received such
official recognition from the
United Nations, he would accept
it as well.
The audience of young
Israelis, mostly affiliated with
dovish political parties and
coexistence activities, greeted
Abbas' comments with multiple
bursts of applause. Israeli Labor
party lawmaker Hilik Bar, who
organized the event, called the
meeting "unprecedented."
It was only a decade ago that
the Muqataa, the Palestinian
government headquarters where
they were visiting, was under
siege by the Israeli army.
Today, the army keeps
Ramallah, the administrative
and financial capital of the West
Bank, off-limits to Israeli Jewish
citizens, making Sunday's trip a
firstvisit for many of the Israelis,
who took photos of themselves
next to Palestinian flags inside
the Muqataa.
"You need to pinch yourself,"
Amir Rosenthal, 26, a philosophy
and economy student at the

University of Haifa, said about
meeting Abbas. "It's real. He's
friendly, he wants peace, and I'm
here in Ramallah."

Notwithstanding its outward
shittiness, like -unwarranted
plot decisions and lazy, mawkish
scripting, the movie softens
the histrionic blow via clever
character flaws and moments of
spellbinding effect. But this effect
is both a blessing and a curse -
while it adds layers to a thinly
veiled script, it also complicates
the narrative in a "huh, what
the fudge" fashion. in the end,
though, certain characters, like
the receptive fathers of the two
lovers, provide ace perfornances
as men with dark pasts trying to
make the future a little brighter.
Despite its palpable campiness
and the fact that it cutely released

merit a bookshelf in the library
of romantic sensibilities. Unless
you're asexual, a nihilist or
just think whatever mom and

titillates us in a way-few films
can - in an existential, ."I know

but it's OK to dream" way. These
"shitty roms" matter because
they say what no other film genre
or sensibility has the brass balls
to say: We know you all want
this, so here's Exhibit A. Fuck
naturalism, this stuff might make
you laugh but it also makes you
think about what could have
been and what could be, whether
you're a romantic or a stone-face
pretending not to be a romantic.
Filmmaker Shana Feste
("Country Strong") knows what
she's doing when she decides on
a "feel this way" soundtrack, or
a romantic climax at the airport,
or a punk slugging away at a
punching bag in an unfinished
garage. She understands that it's
"bad"by commercial, middlebrow
standards, but she doesn't
care. Because "Endless Love"
isn't about avoiding derivative
plot placement or sexy lensing,
it's about feeling nostalgia at a
distance from reality - something
supposedly we are too refined or
intellectual to experience.

'RoboCop' reboot makes a case for itself

BySEAN CZARNECKI
DailyArts Writer
This year's least-desired
remake, "RoboCop," is both
underpinned and undermined
by its decision
to do away B-
with the dark
and campy RoboCop
touches of the
1987 Paul Ver- Quality 6
hoeven origi- and Rave 20
nal. Director Columbia
Josa Padilha
("Elite Squad:
The Enemy Within") makes his
RoboCop sleek. He replaces the
original's jointed movements
with agility and realism. He
neuters it of ultraviolence. He
adds in naturalism, CGI instead
of claymation. It was wise on
Padhila's part to understand
the impossibility of imitating
Verhoeven. Here is a remake
admirable in its efforts, com-
petent, oftentimes cerebral and
talky, sometimes even great.
But for the most part, it lacks a
style strong enough to warrant
resurrecting a classic, whose
unique character had made it so
memorable.
"RoboCop" is, of course, the
futuristic story of a Detroit
cop named Alex Murphy (Joel
Kinnaman, "The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo") who is killed
by gangsters and brought back
to life through technology.
Omnicorp, a multinational
corporation, creates an
armored suit to which they
fuse what's left of his body
and consciousness, a suit that
will be a powerful weapon for
the police and a political tool
for Omnicorp's monetary gain.
Murphy must fight crime-
ridden Detroit and he must
fight for his own humanity and
bring justice to the guilty.

For a relatively straightfor-
ward plot, "RoboCop" loses its
way in Joshua Zetumer's script
(his first). Fastidious conversa-
tions account for huge amounts
of the 118-minute runtime;
often the film feels much longer.
The political and philosophi-
cal scope of their conversations,
wisely disguised in the form of
corporate politics, is commend-
able, tackling everything from
invasion of privacy to existen-
tialism to the military industrial
complex. As much as I enjoyed
watching Samuel L. Jackson's Pat
Novak, a caricaturized conserva-
tive TV pundit, which reminds
audiences of this prolific actor's
comedic talent just as "Django
Unchained" had, "RoboCop"
plays out more like the cable
culture it skewers so deliciously.
Its messages, repeated time and
time again, leave little room for
interpretation. Said simply: This
movie is too cerebral for its own
good. Thankfully, there is plenty

of wry humor to balance out the
weighty musings of its players.
But Padhila and Zetumer add
such sentiment and longing to
this story. Their most effective
scene comes when Murphy asks
Dr. Dennett Norton, played by
Gary Oldman ("Lawless") with
warmth and earnest idealism,
to remove his suit so that he can
see his body. The result is stun-
ning and horrific: Piece by piece,
machines pull the suit apart to
reveal a glass jar of gore and ver-
tebrae, swelling lungs, a severed
hand. "Holy Christ," Murphy
says. "Holy Christ, there's noth-
ing left." Later, behind closed
doors, the men who control
Murphy - he's only a product
of Omnicorp - discuss among
themselves his humanity; Ray-
mond Sellars, CEO of Omnicorp,
(Michael Keeton, "The Other
Guys")' reaches the conclusion
that this is only a machine who
thinks he's Alex. (Again, this is a
long, long conversation.)

Philosophy aside, as an action
film, the theatrics and gymnastic
gunplay lack the bite, the
intensity you've been waiting for.
And coming from the director of
the very R-rated "Elite Squad"
series, we expect more.
All in all, this film has some
moments of true vision. Action
takes a backseat to its palpable
angst and philosophizing,
which is as much a virtue as it
is a downfall, since its messages
are done with little eloquence.
"RoboCop" wants satire, action,
intellectualism and humor.
Not all these elements blend as
seamlessly as they always could.
Still, you can't help but leave
the theater feeling that there
is real talent behind this film,
that Zetumer will one day write
a great film, that Padhila will
direct a massive blockbuster,
that Kinnaman, with his
rugged face, full of confidence
and pain, will go on to star in
similar movie cop roles.

Peace. Love.

Something's amiss.

Sochi's influence
on social media

Cold and unfulfilling
'Winter's' adaptation

Olympics provide
platform for online
conversation
ByEMILYBODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
The permeation of the
Olympics into all facets of social
media should surprise no one.
Consideringthat my friends and I
have all live-tweeted, most likely
to the chagrin of our followers,
every award show this season,
this level of cultural obsession
makes perfect sense. So much so
that my mother keeps sending me
links (Mom, I love them. Please
continue doing so.)'to every cool/
funny/thoughtful article/Tumblr/
tweet/video she sees relating to
Sochi 2014.
Think about that: my
50-something-year-old mother,
who sometimes needs to call me
about working our cable box,
actively consuming and dispersing
social media surrounding the
Winter Olympics. What does.
that say about Generation Y? We
are the Kings and Queens of the
Interweb. We create, process and
respond to posts all day long. And
that mentality has resulted in huge
amounts of content surrounding
the Olympics.
There has been some contro-
versy about the use of Twitter -
by journalists and athletes alike
- with the hashtag #SochiProb-
lems. While some of the posts are
more lighthearted, obviously pok-
ing fun atthe host country's minor
setbacks, others are much more
scathing. The question is what
the Russian government is going
to make of these international
criticisms. They draw attention to

every imperfection and broadcast
it with avail.
While Twitter and similar
sites allow for wide dispersal of
information, other websites have
gone another route. The day after
the opening ceremony, an article
started popping up on my Face-
book timeline. Friends were shar-
ing it with captions of outrage. My
curiosity was piqued and I finally
read the article. The website pub-
lishing the article was one I was
unfamiliar with, The Daily Cur-
rant . The article, "Man Respon-
sible For Olympic Ring Mishap
Found Dead In Sochi," suggests
that one of the technicians dur-
ing the ceremony was killed with
encouragement from the gov-
ernment for a lighting blunder.
Thankfully, the article was a farce
- much like The Onion, The Daily
Currant is a satirical publication.
That being said, how many people
believed this article without fact
or source checking?
These pieces demonstrate the
potential backlash of increasing
globalization. But not everything
that has come out during the past
two weeks has been negative.
Some of the material created
surrounding the Olympics has
been hilarious, thought-provoking
or generally silly.
One of the best mash-ups of
popular culture and an Olympic
sport came from the redubbing of
an ice dancing routine. Twitter
users started pointing out the
obvious: pairs ice dancing could be
made even better with one simple
addition - Beyonc6. Luckily,
BuzzFeed followed through and
altered a winningperformance by
the University's own Meryl Davis
and Charlie White, taking out

of Beyonc6's most recentself-titled
album. The results are pure magic.
I am sure others would agree that
there should be a new category in
ice skating that only allows the use
of Queen Bey's music.
Another great combination of
pop culture and Olympians comes
in the form of a Tumblr. Shoshi
Games 2014 is dedicated to pho-
toshopping the face of Shoshanna
Shapiro (of HBO's popular show
"Girls") onto Olympians' bodies.
it may sound dumb, but for "Girls"
and Olympics enthusiasts alike,
the results are hilarious. Shoshi
Games 2014 fulfills all of the long-
ings I didn't know existed until I
saw the Tumblr.
In all honesty, one of my favor-
ite uses of social media is the use
of the mobile-app Tinder, and
the Olympic athletes have admit-
ted to it being used in the village.
Take that in. Olympians are find-
ing other Olympians through the
same "dating" app that college
kids use to find hook-ups on cam-
pus. In combination with the dis-
tribution of condoms in Olympic
Village, I can only imagine what
the direct messages are like. Sup
posedly the number of Tinder-
users has skyrocketed in Sochi
since the beginning of the games.
Can you really blame people
though? Tinder seems way more
exciting when you could become'
a match with the likes of Shaun
White or Matteo Guarise instead
of simply the kid that lived down
the hall from you freshman year.
The Olympics don't end until
the Feb. 23rd and surely more
gems will come to fruition thanks
to the Internet. Sochi 204
definitely sets a precedent for the
Olympic Games to come by way of

It took 31 years for Mark
Helprin's novel "Winter's Tale"
to reach the big screen. The novel
- originally

1983 - is a

commentary on Tale
life in New York Qualityl6and
City, spanning Rave20
nearly 100 years
and exploring Warer Btss.
the cultures of
two distinct
time periods. It succeeds as a bold
love story, an urban tragedy -
innovative for both its scope and
colloquial charm. The aesthetics
of Helprin's writing are consistent
and augment the story's rich
devices. The novel's function
as a poetic, romantic drama,
however, is completely ignored in,
director Akiva Goldsman's recent
cinettsatic rendition. The film
misrepresents or misinterprets
nearly every symbolic pillar
and instead, strives to depict a
fantasficlA'callOus love tale.
The character relationships-
consistently fail to invigorate the
defunct and exaggerated plot.
Peter Lake (Colin Farrell, "Saving
Mr. Banks") is a thief in 19th
century New York City under the
dictation of Irish gangster Pearly
Soames (Russell Crowe, "Man of
Steel"). After failing to please the

boss, Lake decides to flee from
New York. The last burglary he
commits is of a Central Park West
mansion, in which dying heiress
Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown
Findlay, "Downtown Abbey")
awaits her impending demise at
the hands of tuberculosis. The two
fall in love and Lake resolves to
help cure herillness.
Weak performances by
accomplished actors merely add to
the film's contemptible conjecture.
Russell Crowe is a droog-
controlling tyrant that oversees
most of the city's underworking.
He is evil, and everyone but Crowe
seems to know this. Granted, the
role is tricky, he reports to ajudge/
devil-type.character called Lucifer
(played by Will Smith, "After
Earth"), who teeters on the verge
of clinical insanity and, for some
unexplained reason, is unable
to leave New York City when
Peter Lake flees with Beverly. A
mix of unabashed plot holes and
character flaws prevent Crowe
from delivering a truly powerful
menace. What we get instead
is a flaky, frustrated mob boss
- forever stuck chucking his
droogsafter a low-leveloiminalt
andhis doomed love interest.
The rampant time shifting
is another major component of
the film's gradual collapse. The
film employs deus ex machina
often, so as to coax the audience
into believing that the story is
set in another reality, but it can't
explain Peter Lake's quantum

leaps from New York in the 1890s
to New York in 2014. The script
offers minimal justification for
this phenomenon. It becomes
a part of the story that is to be
accepted and committed to
heart. Many aspects of the film
commandeer this same method
of demand.
Ultimately, many fans of the
book will be disappointed with
Goldsman's adaptation. A great
part of the novel's attention
to poetic detail was simply
lost in the translation. What
should be a marvelous story,
one complemented by crime,
culture, patriotism, history
and love, ends up as a shallow
spin on unrebutted time travel.
Helprin's New York City is filled
with a diversity of characters and
experiences - a winter's tale that
rouses compassion. Goldsman's
New York Cityachieves no such
culture.
Winter's stolid frost is often
associated with beauty. A scene
consisting of a frozen lake,, a
frosted bridge and a cozy cottage
should present some degree of
visual splendor. A love story

By KARSTEN SMOLINSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Visually and aurally charged
with a diverse collage of mod-
ern Rome's splendor from the
ancient ruins
to the night- B+
clubs, "The
Great Beauty" The Great
relates the com-
mon story of BeutY
man's search Michigan
for meaning Theater
with an uncom-
mon approach. Janus Films
Though the
plot meanders
and drags at points, the sights and
sounds of writer/director Paolo
Sorrentino's ("This Must Be the
Place") vision of Rome never grow
stale.
Jep Gambardella, an aging writ-
er and connoisseur of Rome's high
society nightlife, loves to party. He
drinks and dances all night, finally
going to bed as the rest of the city
awakens. Leaning on the popu-
larity of his only novel, written in
his youth, Jeb has spent nearly 40
years this way. However, follow-
ing shortly after his 65th birthday,
news of the death of his first love
triggers potent memories of his
past and a lack of fulfillment with
his hedonistic lifestyle.
"The Great Beauty" tells the
story of an artist floundering in
apathy, unable to create anything
he finds meaningful. Surrounded
by pseudo-intellectuals, art snobs
and has-beens, Jeb feels adrift in a
seaofesotericdrivel and absurdity.
Toni Servillo ("Il Divo: La Spetta-
colare Vita di Giulio Andreotti")
plays the jaded writer, perfectly
portraying Jeb's inner turmoil
through his long, contemplative
gazes and those rare moments
when, unable to contain what's

"Anyway, here's 'Wonderwall.'"
below the surface,his face contorts
in agony. The narrative follows
him as he attempts to navigate
the multitudinous arts and rela-
tionships of Rome, searching for
meaning to inspire him.
The film's cinematography
embodies this search, mimicking
the artist's eye as it picks over the
world surrounding Jeb. Often-
times, it discovers one of the sub-
plots woven throughout the film,
such as a friend's suicidal child or
a washed-up, coked-out ex-televi-
sion star. These details round out
Sorrentino's portrait of absurdity.
The camera moves ceaselessly,
sometimes sweeping over pan-
oramas of Rome or a gorgeous,
turquoise sea, drifting over fine
architectural details or shaking
with the beat of another glitzy
party. The viewer gets the sense
that Sorrentino has framed every
scene with purpose and meticu-
lously planned every tracking
shot. Together, Jeb and the audi-
ence scrutinize these displays,
digging for purpose. The bril-
liant soundtrack compliments
this examination of art through
classical songs that infuse the
picture with their tone of wonder
and awe.
As Jeb surveys Renaissance
paintings and sculptures, incred-

ible landscapes and the bod-
ies of nude women, art and the
everyday begin to bleed into
one another. In one scene, Jeb
rehearses the words and actions
he will give to a mourning friend
as condolence. Even his social
interactions have become a per-
formance, showing how a life
awash in excessive art gradually
sinks into meaninglessness. The
messages soon contradict one
another and form an irreconcil-
able sense of absurdity.
Lacking in any completely
revolutionary ideas, "The Great
Beauty" inevitably draws com-
parisons to the films of'Fellini,
such as the decadent "La Dolce
Vita" or the contemplative "81."
However, these comparisons
come off favorably in the end,
evoking the masterful skill of
these Italian auteurs. With this
film, Paolo Sorrentino deftlyuses
cinematography and sound to
explore every possible facet of
art and meaning. By the time the
credits role, most viewers will
possess very few new answers
regarding the purpose of art and
life. However, Sorrentino's focus
on capturing the immense power
and beauty of this question will
restore any audience member's
sense of awe.

Wisconsin tops
Michigan, 75-62

Frank's red hot:
Kaminsky rolls

Wolverines start
cold, comeback
falls short as teams
split season series
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
The way Jon Horford
described it, there are days
when the effort and energy sag,
and to combat the lethargy, you
have to dig deep to bring it out.
The Michigan men's
basketball team couldn't do
that in the first half Sunday
night, and an 18-point deficit
was too much to make up in
the Wolverines' 75-62 loss to
Wisconsin in Crisler Center on
Sunday afternoon.
"You have to look within
yourself, and you have to bring
that energy out," said the
redshirt junior center. "You
have to force it. I hate to use the

word 'force,' but it is something
that you have to get done if you
want to have success."
in an anemic first half,
the 15th-ranked Wolverines
recorded no assists and seven
turnovers to complement
32-percent shooting as the
Badgers raced out to a 34-19
halftime lead.
Though Michigan turned
a switch in the second half to
whittle the 15-point deficit
down to three, its luck ran out as
the Badgers stormed right back
in the final minutes.
"It was too big of a hole that
we dug ourselves in the first
half, and we couldn't really get
out of it," said sophomore guard
Caris LeVert.
The game looked like a mirror
image of the teams' last contest
a month ago in Madison.
The home team came out
sluggishly, and the amped-up
visitors drove the lead into the
teens. Then the home team
charged back, and, like the Jan.

18 game, the comeback attempt
fell short.
"They're really good, and
we weren't so good today," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
"We fought back, and I really
thought we were going to come
all the way back."
Badger forward Frank
Kaminsky teed off on the
Michigan frontcourt, making 11
of his 16 shots for 25 points with
11 rebounds. The Badgers' 32
points in the paint exposed the
Wolverine big men, who hadn't
faced such a stiff test.
In a handful of Michigan
losses this season, LeVert has
carried the scoring with much
of the rest of the offense gone
silent, and Sunday was no
different.
The sophomore guard scored
a career-high 25 points on 5-for-
6 shooting from deep. That

body to first create a gap to drive
to the basket and then finesse to
make space at the hoop, Kaminski
was the leading reason Michigan

"We were able to get it to him,

"And once he got it 12 feet away -
12 to maybe 15 - that's when he

As the game winded down in

It seemed like the majority of

team's offensive weapons
played like somebody else was
going to step up. Freshman
point guard Derrick Walton
Jr., finished the game with
zero points on six shots despite
scoring in double figures in

Added sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas: "Defensively and
offensively, there just wasn't that
sense of urgency there. Whether
that was rotations on defense
or being aggressive and making
smart decisions on the offensive
end, it just wasn't there today."
Right now, a week before
Michigan State, we'll have to
take Michigan's word that the
lack of effort was an anomaly,
just a weird hiccup in an
otherwise impressive run
through the Big Ten.
But there is no hiding or a
place for excuses next weekend,
because the Spartans are in
town in a game that very well
could decide the Big Ten title. If
the Wolverines can't get up for
that one, this team has bigger

enough to outscore the rest of

And yet, with a win next
weekend, none of that matters.
In the last two weekends,
Michigan has dropped out of
first place with a loss, only to
see Michigan State fall later in

Youth on display in baseball's weekend in Texas

Wolverines take
early leads but
falter to 1-2-1 mark
in opening games
By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan baseball coach Erik
Bakich saidearlierthis weekthat
his team's abundance of youth
would have ups and downs this
season. And this was certainly
on display this weekend at the
Texas State Tournament in San
Marcos, Texas.
Michigan jumped out to
early leads in each of its four
games this weekend but only
held onto one, finishing 1-2-1.
The competition included Texas
State, Air Force and two games
against Washington.
Relief pitching, when healthy,
is one of the strongest areas for
Michigan, but with sophomore
Jacob Cronenworth recovering
from labrum surgery, it became
one of the weakest. Bakich
expects the sophomore to be
back in the next two weeks.
Without their premier closer,
the Wolverines (1-2-1) threw
freshman left-hander Brett
Adcock to finish off Texas State
(1-1) in the opening game.
The Wolverines went up 7-3
early andtheir batswere hot. But
Michigan's bats started to cool
while the Bobcats' bats started
to find rhythm. After giving up
a walk and two hits to load the
bases, Michigan replaced fifth-
year senior right-hander Logan
McAnallen for Adcock midway
through the eighth inning.
With the bases juiced and
needing only one out, Adcock
gave up a two-RBI single
before giving up another RBI
single, tying the game. Adcock
remained in the game and
got through the ninth inning,
but couldn't finish in the loth

hits balls as hard you can hit
balls all weekend long. He's one
of the guys coaches talk about -
players that force them to keep
writing their name in the lineup.
He did that this weekend, that's
for sure."
Lamb aside, the Wolverines
got steady production from
infielder Ramsey Romano. The
freshman reached base in all
four games, while also stealing
a base and driving in two runs.
Cronenworth continued
where he left off last season,
batting .312 on the weekend
with four RBI, two doubles and
a triple.
The Wolverines certainly
had its ups-and-downs this
weekend, and is only beginning
to find their identity.
"There were definitely some
bright spots, but the biggest
bright spot was getting the
whole team out there competing
against another jersey," Bakich
said. "Even though the outcome
wasn't what we wanted, we
know we're going to get better,
there's no question about that.
The first time being outside

inning. The freshman walked
the first hitter before giving up
the game-winning single to cap
an 8-7 loss.
"(Adcock) is throwing
strikes but just giving up some
hits right now," Bakich said.
"Unfortunately the balls he gave
up happened to find holes. He's
not going to get hit like that
moving forward."
Adcock's struggles didn't end
there. The freshman couldn't
find any rhythm Sunday against
Washington (2-1-1), giving up
four hits and one earned run
in his only inning pitched. The
Wolverines couldn't rebound
from the pitching woes, tying
the Huskies 7-7 in eight innings.
The game had to end early due
to travel conflicts.
"He's actually going to be

From Page 18
rim, put Michigan in position
to get a comeback win, but the
Wolverines' other failings were
too significant to be hidden.
LeVert's offense couldn't
compensate for a lack of rhythm
elsewhere on the court. Sopho-
more forward Glenn Robinson
III scored 10 points, and sopho-
more guard Nik Stauskas picked
up 11, but no one else had more
than six.
"When I was on the bench
at one point in the first half, it
just seemed like we were going
side to side," Stauskas said. "We
weren't going north to south to
the basket."
What originally could be
written off as hot Wisconsin
shooting in the first half became
more of a systemic problem in
Michigan's play.
The Wolverines (10-3 Big Ten,
18-7 overall) failed to rebound,
giving the Badgers second-
chance opportunities - and
easy ones at that. Wisconsin
(8-5, 21-5) had 16 from in close
by halftime, and it didn't have to
fight too hard to get them.
That hindered Michigan's
ability to get run-outs after
missed baskets, and the lack of
transition opportunities led to
the feeble first-half output.
If it felt like you could recall
each of the Wolverines' first-half
baskets one-by-one, it's because
you probably could. They made
just seven baskets in the frame,
and the lackluster half was the

worst that Michigan has played
all season.
Their 19 points in a half
weren't just a season low; they
were a season low for any
of Michigan's opponents -
exhibition games too - which
included Concordia, UMass-
Lowell and Houston Baptist.
"It was one of those games
where you bury yourself and
you're going to have to play
a super second half," Beilein
said. "While we played better, it
wasn't good enough."
With six minutes remaining,
Michigan finished reeling off a
16-7 run to cut the Wisconsin
lead to 52-49. Momentum was
favoring the home team, but
a series of Badgers 3-pointers
put the finishing touches on
Michigan's third loss in as many
weekends.
There was a corner three by
known Michigan tormentor Josh
Gasser, and then another three
on a step-back by Kaminsky
at the top of the key with two
minutes left to put the game out
of reach.
It was a game where the Bad-
gers turned the ball over just
twice. Michigan finished with
no steals and no blocks. It was
a sign that it wasn't all there
for the Wolverines. There was
something essential missing.
"People go through that their
whole lives," Horford said. "It
doesn't matter in sports or work-
ing in a job. There's days where
you just don't have it, and you
don't want it. Just don't want to
do anything, it's just like,'I'm not
feeling it."'

As the shot clock approached

back and crushed any hopes the
Wolverines had of a comeback
in the final two minutes with a
3-pointer, his only basket from
long range for the game.
As much as the shot
represented a dagger for the

Badgers, it represented an
end to the talk for Ryan about
a similar shot Stauskas had
against Wisconsin on Jan. 18.
"I mean what else was
he going to do when he did
the step-back," Ryan said.
"He probably got tired of me
showing Stauskas' step-back
that he hit against us. I guess
our guys were tired of seeing
it because Frank did one of his
own. Did you notice that?"
Stauskas definitely noticed it,
calling ita "fair comparison."
"Yeah, that was a dagger
definitely," he said. "After he
hit that, it definitely took the
energy out of us and that was
big shot for them."

hockey coach Red Berenson set
a goal for the second half of the
season to improve special teams.
His players have responded well

Defensively, the penalty-killing

two goals in the past six games
