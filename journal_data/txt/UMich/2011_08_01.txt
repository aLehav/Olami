AAPD says they
suspect one or
two attackers

As part of the Ann Arbor
Police Department's continued
efforts in searching for suspects
involved in the recent series of
assaults against women in the
community, they are enlisting all

resources available, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigations.
Ann Arbor Police Chief Bar-
nett Jones announced at a press
conference on July27 that the city
is currently in the process of find-
ing one or two suspects as part of
its investigation into six assaults
against women since July 15. Four
of the assaults have been catego-
rized as sexual assaults - two of
which were rapes.
Jones - whose announce-
ment followed a July 26 sexual
assault where a woman was
grabbed from behind and fondled
on the 700 block of South State

Street at about 11:30 p.m. while
walking to her car - confirmed
on July 27 the correlations in
descriptions of the attackers led
AAPD to conclude the assaults
were carried out by either one or
two suspects.
He also said AAPD pledges to
use all available resources to bring
the offender or offenders into cus-
tody. Among those resources is
the FBI, which announced July
28 it will aid in the investigations.
AAPD requested the FBI's
assistance on these cases, accord-

University renews partnership with Traverse
City Film Festival in quest to expand the arts

Event aims to
teach students and
residents about the
art of filmmaking
ByJESSICA TREPKA
For the Daily
Film enthusiasts from around
the country and beyond gathered
in Traverse City, Mich. this past
week to experience the art of film
at the seventh annual Traverse
City Film Festival.
The festival, which was
held from July 26 to July 31, was
developed in 2005 by Michael
Moore, a native Michigander and
renowned political filmmaker.
The University decided to renew
its educational affiliation with the
festival for a second year by invit-
ing University professors from the
department of Screen Arts & Cul-
tures to serve as jurors for many
of the films previewed at the fes-
tival.
Lee Doyle, director of the Uni-
versity's Film Office, said the film
festival's popularity has increased
substantially since its inception,
noting that admission has dou-
bled since its first year, and last
year's festival offered more than

135 screenings and received more
than 106,000 submissions.
Doyle added that Moore's
vision and enthusiasm for film
has served as the festival's lasting
legacy.
"(The) imprint of Michael
Moore has enthusiasts of the film
industry gathering together,"
Doyle said. "He has created an
atmosphere for film fans of all
sorts of interests."
Moore chooses which films
are shown and often decides on
content that pushes boundaries
in order to open the public's eyes
to serious issues, according to the
festival's online mission state-
ment.
"Aspecial emphasis isgiven to
foreign films, American indepen-
dents, documentaries, and films
which have been overlooked but
deserve the attention of a public
starved to see a good movie," the
festival's website said.
However, the festival is not
limited to film viewings. There is
also an onsite film school where
the public can take classes to
enrich their knowledge of sub-
jects like directing, screenwriting
and how to break into the indus-
try, many of which are taught by
University professors, Doyle said.
"One of the main purposes
is to teach people to view film as

an art," he said. "The film festival
helps people take film more seri-
ously."
Doyle added that by partak-
ing in the festival, the University
aims to elevate the role of the arts
in public life and to show that it is
more than just a research institu-
tion.
"It is always important for the
University to reach out," Doyle
said. "We take our role as a pub-
lic University very seriously. We
have a strong alumni base, and we
enjoy bringing a part of the Uni-
versity to them."
Two short films - "Work/
Study," written by Ben Ellmann
and directed by Joey Bergren as
well as "Shark Tank," written
by Kelci Parker and directed by
Barbara Twist - were created by
students from SAC and viewed at
the festival by a wide array of film
fans, experts and industry mem-
bers.
Festival juror and University
SAC Prof. Colin Gunckel said the
chance to have student works
shown at a popular festival pro-
vides immense opportunities for
film students and also serves as a
forum to showcase the University
and its SAC program.
"Our participation allows
festival attendees to understand
what our department is all about,

and provides us as faculty with an
opportunity to share our knowl-
edge and expertise beyond a
purely academic setting," Gunckel
said.
Additionally he said the fes-
tival provides students with both
internship opportunities and the
ability to network with profes-
sionals.
"(The students are) certainly
gratified to hear a large audi-
ence react to their films, espe-
cially when they laugh at the right
parts," Gunckel said. "It's also an
excellent chance for them to net-
work. A number of our students
also work as interns for the fes-
tival - a great way for them to
get experience beyond the class-
room."
He added he was excited to
take part in the festival because
it draws attendees from around
the world who become immersed
in the culture and community
of Traverse City by partaking in
activities like screening films on
the lakeshore.
"The festival also gener-
ates a great deal of enthusiasm
among the residents of Traverse
City," Gunckel said. "Screenings
are frequently sold out and the
entire town is truly energized and
excited about cinema. It's really a
unique environment to witness."

. Council to revisit panhandling amendments

Officials question
enforcement of
city panhandling
legislation
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
After being unanimously
approved by the Ann Arbor City
Council on May 2, city officials
say the amendment that calls for
panhandlers to gain formal per-
mission to be on city property
hasn't proved to be as effective as
anticipated.
The council began work-
ing on the panhandling legisla-
tion in September 2010, when
the city's Downtown Marketing
Task Force - a group that aims
to ensure a safe and clean down-
town area - first convened after
a year of talks between the Ann
Arbor City Council and Mayor
John Hieftje. During this time,
city council invited merchants,
police officers, panhandlers,
University officials and home-

that the perception that there are
not enough police officers patrol-
ling Ann Arbor's streets following
recent layoffs is invalid.
Referring to the recent string
of assaults, Rapundalo's challenger,
Tim Hull, a programmer at the Uni-
versity's Center for Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics and a
member of the city's taxicab board,
said now is not a time to cut public
safety. Instead, administrative and
capital expenses need to be evalu-
ated and reduced, he said.
Hull added an important part of
his campaign is ensuring students
feel involved in the council's actions.
"I feel like sometimes students
feel left out of the city's affairs,"
Hull said. "I feel like sometimes
their concerns are neglected
because they're just students."
KUNSELMAN SAYS RACE IS
ALL ABOUT THE DDA
City Council member Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said he
takes a firm stance against the city's

less organizations to voice their
concerns about the upswing of
panhandling and offer possible
solutions.
The meetings yielded a
42-page report - published at
the end of the task force's six-
month assignment in March
- recommending a "program
of educational outreach to the
community" and an amendment
to the city's panhandling ordi-
nances.
Tom Heywood, executive
director of the State Street Area
Association, said the number
of panhandlers on State Street,
South University Avenue and
Main Street this summer has
been "about the same" as previ-
ous summers, a time when com-
munity members often claim to
notice an influx of panhandlers.
Heywood added that with a
decreased number of police offi-
cers following this year's city
budget cuts, as well as the Ann
Arbor Police Department's need
to address more urgent matters
- like the recent spate of sexual
assaults - enforcement of the
panhandling amendment was
Downtown Development Authority,
which he said is "running rampant"
with spending and has caused the
city to incur $140 million in debt.
"They have been spending
more public dollars then they have
received in the last four years,"
Kunselman said. "(The DDA) is
projected to do so again as they're
drawing down their fund reserves
to an irresponsible low."
Kunselman specifically cited
the decision to construct an under-
ground parking structure on South
Fifth Avenue between East William
Street and East Liberty Street as a
resultof poor judgmentby the DDA,
adding that it financially turned the
community "upside down."
Kunselman accused the DDA of
trying to force him out of office, not-
ing three of the endorsements held
by one of his challengers - Ingrid
Ault, executive director of Think
Local First - are DDA board mem-
bers, including City Council mem-
ber Sandi Smith (D-Ward 1).
"This election has turned into
my calling out the irresponsible
spending of the DDA," Kunselman
said. "And they in turn are trying
to remove meas an elected official."
He added because the city is in

expected to be relegated.
"Enforcement is always going
to be dependent on resources,
and we haven't had beat cops in
a while, a couple of years," he
said. "When you have things
like sexual assaults, the police
department, the University and
the city are going to spend more
time working on those kinds of
things than something like pan-
handling. That's just the reality
of how you triage things."
While he said he understands
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment's prioritization, he said the
task force has worked to regulate
the issue to some degree, adding
the city will never be fully able
to eliminate panhandling since
preventing citizens to engage in
such acts is violating their first
amendment right to free speech.
"I think that Ann Arbor does
an outstanding job trying to deal
with the entire problem ..." Hey-
wood said. "It's just going to
be with us all the time ... You're
never going to eliminate it, and
you're never going to have com-
plete control of this as long as
people have the right to express
debt, financial cuts to services like
public safety were unavoidable.
"Unfortunately, the cuts are
necessary because we don't have
the money," Kunselman said.
"We've got a yoke of debt burden
around the city financial budget."
While Ault acknowledged that
public safety cuts were essential,
she said the unions that represent
firefighters and police officers need
to make more compromises in their
negotiations.
Kunselman's other challenger,
Marwan Issa, technology direc-
tor at Global Education Excellence,
criticized public safety cuts made
by the city.
"We shouldn't be cutting safe-
ty," Issa said. "Our students expect
to be safe."
Issa has proposed the Univer-
sity subsidize education and health-
care for Ann Arbor residents facing
"temporary economic hardship."
He added the University Hospital
- a non-profit organization - has
enough funds to perform health-
care for residents "pro bono."
COUNCIL CANDIDATES SAY
UNIVERSITY STUDENT
INVOLVEMENT IS KEY

themselves."
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)
agreed enforcement of the
amendment has remained inef-
fective thus far.
"We heard from people who
lived downtown who complained
that they couldn't walk two
blocks from their home without
being followed down the street,
without being confronted by peo-
ple demanding money, without
feeling like they needed to cross
the street to avoid people," Briere
said.
She added that though an
absence of data has made it dif-
ficult for her to fully assess the
amendment's impact, there are
a few indicators it has been suc-
cessful in curbing panhandling.
She said this includes a lowered
amount of complaints from the
community and a decrease in
news coverage of panhandling
incidents.
However, she said she
couldn't fully determine if the
apparent decrease is because of
the amendment or the possibility
that panhandlers didn't choose
Ann Arbor as a destination this
Council member Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) said it is critical that
students understand council mem-
bers are always available to them if
they need assistance.
Anglin said while the council
tries to address student issues, there
is not always continual dialogue
- something that is important in
order for change in the city to occur.
"I need students to know they
can contact me," Anglin said.
When asked about recent stu-
dent concern over a lack of proper
lighting in the Oxford Road area -
most notably brought to council by
the Greek community and Michi-
gan Student Assembly officials fol-
lowing a string of armed robberies
in January - Anglin expressed con-
cern that the council has not taken
action to resolve the issue, calling
the area "spooky" for residents
walking alone at night.
Anglin said the responsibility
of lighting the Oxford area, as well
as other areas with high student
populations, should ultimately fall
on landlords.
"If there is student housing or
someone's renting to a student, they
should be required to install a light
in the street," Anglin said. "If every-

year.
Briere said she is also con-
cerned about the uninitiated
panhandling education program
that was created by the March
report because the task force
hasn't been active since Febru-
ary 4.
"As a committee, we asked
that the task force be reinvigorat-
ed and take on this responsibility
of providing the education," Bri-
ere said. "And that's been not as
effective a request, unfortunate-
ly, as I would've liked to see. We
need the cooperation of down-
town residents and merchants.
We need the support of the busi-
nesses in order to do this."
Briere nonetheless said she
remains confident about the
future of the panhandling edu-
cation program and the city's
initiatives to aid the homeless.
When students return in the fall,
she said she hopes to discuss the
issue with the University and the
Michigan Student Assembly to
institute those measures, adding
that by then she expects to con-
vince the task force to reconsti-
tute.
body's got a light on the street, then
the student areas will be much bet-
ter than they are now."
Ward 5 challenger Neal Elya-
kin, supervisor of young adult
programs for the Washtenaw Inter-
mediate School District and a mem-
ber of the Ann Arbor Human Rights
Commission, said he isn't familiar
with the details regarding light-
ing issues near Oxford. Despite his
lack of knowledge on the issue, he
said the city should listen to student
concerns.
In addition to making it a prior-
ity to address student issues, Elya-
kin said council members must
look toward the future and explore
opportunities for economic devel-
opment, mass transit and other ven-
tures.
He added the city should
embark upon increased collabo-
rations with the University in an
effort to achieve these objectives.
"I think it's ineffective for
us, meaning the city, to say that
the University of Michigan is not
a good partner," Elyakin said. "I
don't think that's an effective way
of creating positive relationships
with the largest employer (in the
city)."

Vote Issa, Rapundalo, Anglin
City Council needs representatives to pull Ann Arbor through economic woes

With such a small population going to the polls, every
vote can tip the balance in tomorrow's Ann Arbor
City Council Primary elections. The Republican
candidates are running unopposed, but for those who are plan-
ning on voting Democrat, there is a diverse pool of candidates
to choose from. Ann Arbor, like many cities in the country,
has faced tough economic decisions, and will likely face even
more difficult decisions in the future. It's important, maybe
now more than ever, that the city has the right people sitting
on council as it trudges through the hard times ahead.

In Ward 2, incumbent Stephen
Rapundalo is being challenged
by Tim Hull, a programmer
at the University's Center for
Computational Medicine and
Bioinformatics and the current
head of the city council's taxicab
board. Hull, a 26-year old who
holds a master's degree from
the University, empathizes with
a community that has a large
college population. He is earnest
in his desire to scrutinize the
city's budget and cut areas that
aren't personnel or employees.
While this platform is noble
and deserves attention, the
unfortunate reality of city
finances and his lack of public
experience maypreventhimfrom
effectively making the changes
to which he is committed.
Rapundalo has been on the
City Council for years and has
an extensive knowledge of
city finances and governance.
Recently, though, Rapundalo
was in the minority of city
council dissenters on the long
awaited mandate of the local

medical marijuana ordinances,
but his desires for a perfect plan
may have hampered a solution
that was well overdue. This,
along with his endorsement
of the couch ban, are actions
that reveal some of the poor
policy decisions he should
avoid revisiting. Despite these
shortcomings, Rapundalo's
experience in the coming years
will be a stronger asset than
Hull's good will. The incumbent
is similarly committed to cutting
expenditures and wants to go
about it in the least painful way.
If he is elected, he would do
well to remember that cutting
employees is the most painful
way to balance the budget.
The Michigan Daily endorses
Stephen Rapundalo for Ward 2.
Neal Elyakin, supervisor
of young adult programs for
the Washtenaw Intermediate
School District and a member
of the Ann Arbor Human Rights
commission, is challenging
incumbent Mike Anglin in Ward
5. Elyakin has a vision of Ann

Arbor where all branches of
government and governmental
organizations work congruently
while looking twenty years
down the road. He goes to great
lengths to emphasize this goal,
but he needs specific plans to
coincide with the visions of a
greater Ann Arbor years down
the road. Elyakin also proposes
the experimentation of property
taxes on the University,
which could spell trouble for
an institution that is already
strapped for cash. This measure
could lead to higher tuition,
less growth within the city and
even less amicable interaction
between Ann Arbor and its
biggest financial wellspring.
Elyakin wants to take a very
moderate and pragmatic
approach to each issue, which is
commendable, but there should
be some areas where one has
conviction and wants to push
projects to fruition. He has a lot
of ideas and a lot of questions,
but Elyakin seems to lack the
answers.

on the other side of Ward 5's ballot,
Anglin wants to bring the Ann Arbor
community together on decisions
that occur in the present. He wants to
improve the council's transparency by
creating a committee that would take
in public perspective and input before
various items reach City Council. He
also favors bringing students and the
City Council together and looks for
a broader dialogue with all residents
of Ann Arbor. He wishes to focus on
safety, though with recent laws like
the city's ban on porch couches, he may
be taking his concerns too far. Elyakin
has some laudable qualities that should
be present in a city councilmen, but
his proposed platform doesn't bring
enough concrete ideas to the table. The
Michigan Daily endorses Mike Anglin
for Ward 5.
In the third ward, there are two
challengers to the incumbent Stephen
Kunselman. Running for his third term,
Kunselman wants to focus on what
he believes are the chief roles of city
council: utility, safety and well-being.
He doesn't believe City Council should
be a force for generating business and
instead wants to keep the focus simpler.
While all of his outlined priorities
should be primary concerns of the
council, the importance of business
and development in Ann Arbor should
not be forgotten. Ingrid Ault, executive
director of Think Local First, differs
greatly from Kunselman's view and
wants to flex the council's ability to
rescue business within the city. One
of her primary concerns is raising
the amount of affordable housing,
something the city desperately needs
more of. Housing prices gouge students,
and while many candidates simply defer
to market forces, Ault is committed
to bringing more housing options to

the table. She believes in engaging
with students actively and thoroughly,
something other city councilmen have
neglected in the past. However, she is
not without her shortcomings. Her lack
of knowledge on the medical marijuana
ordinances and a paucity of attention
on issues other than city economics
obscures many future policies she may
vote on as a councilwomen.
Marwan Issa, technology director
at Global Education Excellence and
a longtime resident of Ann Arbor
who holds a master's degree from the
University, has the most commendable
policy platform for his City Council
candidacy. He endorses the long
overdue medical marijuanaordinances
and is extremely critical of personnel
cuts in the police and fire departments.
Marwan has a liberal view of personal
freedom and also strives to make
citizens safer - not with parental
measures like the couch ban, but by
maintaining strong police and fire
forces in Ann Arbor. Issa may find the
current economic situation is tougher
when he is at the helm than when he is
campaigning (as he will have to clash
with hard bargaining unions), but with
a little leeway from the unions and
some other clever measures, he may
be able to do what other councilman
have not. A new face on the council
and a new point of view may be just
what the council needs to act on some
previously unexplored options. The
Michigan Daily endorses Marwan
Issa for the Ward5.
A familiarity with the current budget
and government process is important,
but a new candidate is necessary to
break the current status quo. There
should be more than austerity in Ann
Arbor's future, and new faces will be
what pushes the city in a new direction.

Affirmative action revisited

Affirmative action has been
controversial for years, especially
at the University of Michigan. Phi-
losophers here such as Elizabeth
Anderson and
Carl Cohen,
along with
sociologist
Patricia Gurin,
have written
books arguing
for and against
it, consider- ANNA
ing whether CLEMENTS
its dangers
outweigh its
benefits, and investigating what
those pros and cons really are.
Now that it's being considered to
no longer be prohibited, we can
explore its risks and advantages.
Will affirmative action, as Carl
Cohen indicates, simply manifest
as sheer racial preference? Or will
it function in a way that enhances
the potential of society, as Eliza-
beth Anderson and Patricia Gurin
prophesy, by using integration
to break down barriers blocking
blacks and other minorities from
opportunities?
An education at the University
can be viewed as a scarce resource,
as Cohen alludes to in his essay
in The Civil Liberties Review
titled "Honorable Ends, Unsavory
Means." He states that "when a
resource is in short supply (such as
seats in a university), and some by
virtue of their race are given more
of it, others by virtue of their race
get less." Viewing education inthis
way may be helpful in deciphering
the social costs and benefits that
exist due to the exclusive nature of
university admissions in general.
However, claiming that "systems
of preferential admissions do not
integrate, they disintegrate" might
not be supported by premises that
point to the scarcity of education.
Furthermore, it doesn't support
the conclusion that affirmative
action is inadvisable.
Anderson examines the com-
pensatory and integrative effects
of affirmative action and argues
for it based on the latter of the two
rationales. Both in the courses she
teaches and in her written work,

she depicts the ways in which pref-
erential admissions policies decon-
struct current barriers to minority
advancement, thereby efficaciously
promoting a fairer, more demo-
cratic society. Segregation is a bar-
rier to democracy; it isolates the
various interests of certain groups
so that the broader public fails to
incorporate them when making
decisions. Thus, policies favoring
the admission of a wider variety
of students into an institution also
function to support democracy by
diminishing the aforementioned
isolation of interests.
The proposal that banned affir-
mative action for the past five years
has been declared unconstitutional
by a federal court of appeals; it
might well go on to the Supreme
Court and be reinstituted there.
Therefore, it is crucial that we at the
University and among the general
public, continue to discuss policies
of affirmative action, and critically
examine the rhetoric supporting
and opposing it. Is it a form of dis-
crimination, condemnable under
laws and values that reject using
personal characteristics such as
race and gender in making hiring
and admissions decisions?
In "Defending Diversity: Affir-
mative Action at the University
of Michigan," Professor Gurin
examines the effects that diver-
sity in the student body has on
individual students' learning
experiences. She includes a selec-
tion of testimonies written by Uni-
versity students on how diversity
has affected their learning expe-
riences. Based on those accounts
as well as on her own specula-
tion, she concludes that "students'
experiences with racial and ethnic
diversity have far-reaching and
significant educational benefits
for both learning and democracy
outcomes, and that these benefits
extend to ... non-minorities and
minorities alike." Thus, by treat-
ing educational diversity as a pub-
lic good, she demonstrates how
affirmative action policies do not
just redistribute resources to the
disadvantaged, or save certain
groups from the segregation that
has been imposed upon them due

to centuries of racism; but rather,
affirmative action has the poten-
tial to help every student become
a more capable citizen.
Gurin cites University politi-
cal scientist Profesor Arlene Sax-
onhouse, who discusses debates
that took place in ancient history
over diversity's impact on democ-
racy in her book Fear ofDiversity.
According to Saxonhouse, Plato
argued that a homogenous soci-
ety is the most beneficial system
for an effective democracy to take
place within, whereas Aristotle
advocates for equal relationships
It's crucial that
we continue
to discuss it.
among people of diverse back-
grounds as a way to let democracy
thrive. In the United States, how-
ever, almost nobody would dare
assert that diversity is a drawback
to an institution. It's one of this
country's central tenets. How else
would capitalism have thrived
here for so long if we did not value
multiplicity or diversity? In order
to have true, functional competi-
tion, differences are critical.
I am not writing this in order
to out professors' political persua-
sions. But it's important, while in
an institution such as this one, to
be aware not only of the content
that is being taught in courses,
but of the backdrop over which
the ideas interact. If affirma-
tive action is put into place, what
changes will we observe? Is educa-
tion the resource over which to be
fought, as Cohen assumes, or is it
a public good, strengthening both
communities and the democratic
process? Determining how we
are to view diversity is crucial in
deciding whether and how to insti-
tute affirmative action policies.

'U' to offer new entrepreneurship master's

Degree combines
engineering and
business curriculum
By MARISA WINTER
For the Daily
For master's students look-
ing to study entrepreneurship,
they will no longer have to look
any further than the University.
Beginning this fall, the College of
Engineering will be collaborating
with the Ross School of Business
to offer a professional master's
degree in entrepreneurship.
Tim Faley, Business School
professor and managing director
at the University's Zell Lurie Insti-
tute for Entrepreneurial Studies,
said the collaboration will bridge
ASSAULTS
From Page 1
Berchtold. However, she said she
couldn't discuss any details of the
Bureau's involvement.
She could, however, say AAPD
is still the primary department on
the cases, and the FBI has no inten-
tion of taking over.
AAPD Lt. Renee Bush said the
FBI will be assisting the Ann Arbor
police along with other depart-
ments like the Michigan State
Police, adding they were asked to
be involved because of the circum-
stances of the cases.
"These are unusual assaults
happening to women ... We can use
all resources," Bush said.
AAPD has received more than
250 tips regarding these assaults,
and they have officers investigating
each one, Bush said.
At the AAPD press conference,
Jones said he greatly appreciated
the community's support and con-
cern over the spate of assaults.
"I'm about to begin a conversa-
tion I believe no law enforcement
officer would ever want to give his
community," he said. "We have a
predator or predators operating in
our community."
Over the course of the 25Anin-
ute press conference, Jones reiter-
ated that last sentence two or three
times, as well as fielded questions
from reporters and addressed

together science and business to
develop additional methods of
innovation.
"It will satisfy a huge need
for technologists who want to be
innovative or are interested in
commercialization of science and
commercialization in general,"
Faley said.
He said engineering and busi-
ness alumni fueled the idea for
the new program because many
believe one specialization is no
longer sufficient to be successful
in the working world.
"Traditional education ave-
nues no longer work in a dynamic
world," Faley said. "Skills in all
areas fill the gap the 'U' isn't offer-
ing. It's not an MBA, which trains
a student how to be a business per-
son, and it's not a science degree.
It's the white space in between
that creates a bridge between sci-

ence and business."
Faley added the program was
put into motion in response to both
student interest and the demand"
from major companies looking for
students who had both technical
and business experience.
"We were overwhelmed at
how hungry engineering students
were to learn business," he said.
"An increasing company demand,
for example from Google and
Cisco Systems, would ask for stu-
dents to become engineers, but
they would be much more effec-
tive in a corporation if they knew
how science would be commer-
cialized."
The Zell Lurie Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies - which
also supports TechArb, the Uni-
versity's entrepreneurial hub -
backed the creation of the master's
degree. Faley said he hopes the

Zell Institute will later expand the
experiment across campus and
help form a similar program with
the Law School.
David Munson, dean of engi-
neering, said the University is
unique because it has both nation-
ally renowned business and engi-
neering school, adding that the
joint effort will produce one of the
best programs in the country.
"The melding of the business
and tech world will generate a lot
more activity in southeast Michi-
gan and throughout the country
and world," Munson said.
Munson added that a business
background can benefit an engi-
neering student in many practical
ways as they embark upon a career
in the corporate world.
"Students have a lot of ideas
for engineering companies to get
formed but not enough business

knowledge or experience to start
a company on their own," Munson
said. "Alumni in engineering were
pushing very hard for additional
programming. Alumni who took
courses in business and are in the
working world had a clear advan-
tage by knowing about business."
Doug Neal, managing director
of the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship, said the degree was created
out of a demand for students seek-
ing to acquire the skills necessary
to start their own businesses.
"(The program was created)
out of a market need for graduate
students looking for an opportu-
nity to get education experience -
and quickly grow startup ideas,"
Neal said.
There is currently a nine-
credit academic program for
undergraduate engineering stu-
dents.

topics like how budget cuts have
impacted AAPD's enforcement,
the victims' descriptions of the
attackers and the increasing need'
for people to be cautious and prag-
matic when walking alone at night.
In response to a query about
whether the recent cutbacks on the
force had hamstrung the depart-
ment's ability to investigate the
assaults, Jones admitted the series
of assaults has taken away "our
sense of safety in our community."
He denied, however, the cuts
had any effect on the investigation,
stood behind the police's approach
to finding the one or two attackers
and lauded the force's investigative
partnerships with local agencies.
He added that the force has devot-
ed 15 officers to the recent assault
cases as well.
"It's still a great town and it is
very upsetting, but we're not in a
vacuum here and ... this is the type
of occasion that we have to rise to
the highest level," Jones said.
In the ongoing search for sus-
pects since the first assault - in
which a woman was pulled into
a dark area but then escaped near
Community High School on Divi-
sion Street on July 151- the Univer-
sity's Department of Public Safety
has also "committed all its resourc-
es" to the investigation.
The department has been rear-
ranging officers' schedules and
postponing their vacations in an
effort to strengthen security on and

around Central Campus, according
to DPS Lt. Robert Neumann.
DPS released a statement on
July 27 saying they will be working
with AAPD to solve the cases even
though they occurred off-campus.
Additionally, both DPS and AAPD
are amping up uniformed police
patrol of Central Campus, the
statement said.
Along with increased secu-
rity measures, the department has
undertaken efforts to encourage
incoming freshmen to be aware
of their surroundings, to walk in
pairs at night and to avoid talking
on their cell phones when walking
alone, Neumann said.
As part of its crime awareness
program, DPS has also pledged to
"talk about this string of incidents
specifically" during freshmen ori-
entation sessions, Neumann added.
In an interview after the press
conference, City Council member
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) said find-
ing the attackers and educating
students is important because the
assaults have deprived the commu-
nity of a sense of security.
"Crimes like this make us all
insecure," Briere said. "We stop
walking around at night. We stop
going to parties. We stop feeling
like we can do what we want to do.
It makes us all question our secu-
rity."
Crime Stoppers of Michigan is
offering a $1,000 reward for a tip
that leads to an arrest.

Crazy mediocre love

COURTESY OF UNIVERSAL

"Can't touch this."

Broncos clash with aliens

By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
The marketers at Universal
seemed to know exactly where to
hit the target audience for "Cow-
boys & Aliens"
- simplistic
but impressive
posters, action- COA"
packed and flashy
trailers. But most & AhiS
important of all AtQuality 16
was a small title and Rave
card advertising
that this film was Universal
from the director
of "Iron Man."
Enough has been mentioned
about said director Jon Favreau.
But his style - or at least the style
Universal banked on getting peo-
ple to the multiplex - was humor-
twinged action with a proficient
hand in special effects and an abil-
ity to handle powerhouse actors
like Robert Downey Jr.
The director plays "Cowboys &
Aliens" with a somewhat different
hand - one that not many expect-
ed and few prefer. He plays it
straight and serious, as if the film's
jumbled script could somehow rest
on its own storytelling laurels. The
simplicity of Universal's posters
comes full circle into a bland and
poorly planned action-adventure
that feels a lot smaller than it's
meant to.
The narrative is messy. We
find Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig,
"Defiance") alone in the 19th-cen-
tury desert, amnesic and affixed
with a strange, thick metal bracelet
on his wrist. He finds his wayto the
town of Absolution, which is ruled
by moneyman Woodrow Dolar-

hyde (Harrison Ford, "Morning
Glory") and tormented by his little
shithead of a kid Percy (Paul Dano,
"There Will Be Blood"). The other
characters we encounter include
a kindly priest (Clancy Brown), a
helpless saloon owner (Sam Rock-
well, "Conviction"), a stoic sheriff
(Keith Carradine, "Peacock") and
a mysterious beauty (Olivia Wilde,
"TRON: Legacy").
Lonergan turns out to be a want-
ed man with a big bounty on his
head. Not remembering his crimes,
he discovers his story's exposition
just as slowly as it's delivered to
us. He gets locked up, ponders his
troubled past and wonders what to
do next.
And then aliens attack.
There's not much need to say
anything more, and before see-
ing the film, most people probably
didn't know anything beyond the
genre-blending concept implied
by the title anyway. Lonergan is a
badass of action, not words. When
people of the town are kidnapped
by the alien ships, though, he leads
an outing to retrieve them, and
thoroughly saves the town from
their foreign visitors.
Lonergan's story is the story of
"Cowboys & Aliens," and the film
rightly focuses on him. That said,
the script doesn't leave everyone
else alone, giving us so much plot
and so many split ends to recon-
nect by the end of the story that the
film has nary a chance of succeed-
ing.
The film is slightly redeemed
by Craig, who has his character-
istic serious look and James Bond
physicality. He is utterly likeable
and plays each scene with a subtle-
ty the entire cast and production

around him seems to severely lack.
The visuals are also occasion-
ally sumptuous. The collision of
fluorescent blue alien light and the
wide brown expanse of the desert
create moments of gooey special
effects goodness, but the Wild
West town footage has the unshak-
able feeling of the archetypal
soundstage setup.
And if you're wondering about
the aliens - they're CGI disgust-
ing, scary and ruthless. Movie
aliens are becoming more and
more physically complex, it seems,
if the two blockbuster alien films
this summer are any indication.
Can't quite rope
in sci-fi too,
podner.
Tryingto provide a counterpoint
of sorts to the cowboys and Indians
concept, "Cowboys & Aliens" tries
hard to bring in an outside force
and create a situation in which all
earthlings can unite. In the end, it
has few real statements to make,
and is derailed into a muddled
series of pointless moments with
over-developed and boring sup-
porting characters.
It seemed like a great concept
- ripe for the 21st century, a rein-
vigorating combination of things
we've seen before - but Favreau
ends up finding the worst of each
of its genres, resulting in two half-
films whose sum is less than its
parts.

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
"Crazy" and "stupid" are two
adjectives that can be used to
describe not only love, but this
movie. Ulti-
mately, it's
people doing
crazy, stupid Crazy
things in the
name of love ... Stupid Love
for two hours. At Quality16
Cal (Steve and Rave
Carell, "Date
Night) has Warner Bros.
been married
to Emily (Juli-
anne Moore, "The Kids Are All
Right") for a very long time. In
fact, she's the only woman he's
ever been with, but she cheats on
him. Luckily, Cal runs into Jacob
(Ryan Gosling, "Blue Valentine"),
who gives him a makeover. Cal is
told that he should never wear
New Balance sneakers (unless
he is in a fraternity or Steve
Jobs), and is taught how to pick
up women. Incidentally, there
are many beautiful women in his
town who are just waiting to be
hit on by 40-and-up gentlemen.
In a "Love Actually" fashion,
there are several side plots that
are forced, with bizarre twists
and the might of the scriptwrit-
ers, to connect at the end.
The movie doesn't sound all
that terrible - in fact, it sounds
like the perfect carefree summer
movie. It's fluff, a kind of make-
over movie for guys. Except, the
movie has no charm and is really
just cringe-inducingly embar-
rassing at times, like when Cal's
17-year-old babysitter takes sexy
nude photos of herself to send to
an older man. There's nothing
cute about that. In fact, that's a
serious issue that doesn't make

for lighthearted fun.
Despite this oversight, the vast
majority of the movie's humor
doesn't depend on outrageous
jokes or big explosions. It's sub-
tle, restrained, and much more
situational. At the same time,
though, the movie is not astute.
There are no biting insights and
it doesn't really explore the rela-
tionships and the love between
the characters
Even Steve Carell himself, the
master of dramatic awkward situ-
ations as demonstrated by his stint
as Michael on TV's "The Office,"
just can't pull off that kind of com-
edy in this movie. The problem
is that Carell is trying to play the
nice guy, the perfect dad who gets
stuck in bad situations instead
of causing them. And that's not
funny. At rare moments, he does
manage to come through as his
comical self, but only briefly, and
when his character is drunkenly
and bitterly berating a cocktail
waitress, or, as he calls her a "cock-
tail servant."
The rest of the cast, while
talented, also struggles a bit.
Gosling just acts as a womaniz-
ing guru with perfectly chiseled
abs and impeccable dress sense.
But he's a shallow character and
when he does undergo a change
and falls in love, it's hard to
understand why. His revealing
that he likes to buy things off of
infomercials doesn't lay bare to
the audience the depths of the
character's soul.
And that's a consistent prob-
lem with the movie, not just with
Gosling's character - though
there's an earnest attempt to
reveal the inner workings of the
characters and their relation-
ships, any insight is lost in the
chaotic plotline and awkward
situational comedy.

drama, and it all went to hell.
Somehow renewed for an eighth
and final season, the show is wise-
ly returning to its roots, and in
the premier, we see some of what
we remember. But throughout the
episode, we're faced with unwel-
coming reminders that the show
we love isn't quite back.
Vince (Adrian Grenier, "The
Devil Wears Prada"), the show's
fantasy A-lister, starts the sea-
son leaving rehab, drawing the
"movie star on coke" storyline to
a welcome close. Meanwhile, his
TV "star" older brother, Drama
(Kevin Dillon, "Hotel for Dogs")
and his ex-weed carrier Turtle
(an almost creepily thin Jerry
Ferrara, "Brooklyn Rules"), comb
Vince's frat house of a mansion for
liquor and drugs. The people who
actually contribute to his career
are busy with their girl problems:
His manager, Eric (Kevin Con-
nolly, "Secretariat") just canceled

his wedding. His agent, Ari (the
always-enjoyable Jeremy Piven,
"The Kingdom") is dealing with
an unwanted separation.

show brings us the kind of witty,
borderline-offensive edge that

' aims to remedy defense Campbell expecting
By TIM RO HANbreay
Daily Spurts Editor u j n o y ar

CHICAGO - Mike Martin and
the rest of the Michigan defen-
sive line wanted to show their new
coaches what they were capable
of, and, what exactly two former
defensive line coaches would have
to start the heart of their defense
with.
Brady Hoke and Greg Mattison
had returned to Michigan, one hav-
ing left to build Ball State and San
Diego State into winning football
programs, while the other molded
successful defenses all over the.
country at the college and profes-
sional level.
Soon after they arrived, Martin
and his defensive linemates were
going through their first workout
of their winter conditioning and the
coaches watched, not saying much.
"We were all going hard, obvi-
ously," Martin said. "(This) was our
first impression on the coach."
After the workout, Mattison
pulled Martin aside and warned
him: "That was terrible. That was
completely terrible. You guys have to
do much better."
"I thought we did pretty good,"
Martin thought to himself
Ever since Hoke and Mattison
took over, the expectations are
higher around the Michigan foot-
ball team, and that has carried over
into summer workouts.
"I feel like that we didn't know
how a championship team really
functioned," Martin said. "That's
why coach Hoke and coach Matti-
son and the rest of the staff are so
vital and a huge asset, because they
know what it takes. They've been
around teams that have won. They
tell us. Before they came in, we
thought we were working hard. We
weren't.
"They've putcthe bar way higher."
The seniors have led "optional"
workouts throughout the summer
and 7-on-7 passing drills for skill-
position players. They may be listed
as "optional," but with the help the
new accountable attitude Hoke has
instilled, there has been a 100-per-
cent participation rate.
"All of them wanted to show up,"
junior quarterback Denard Robin-
son said. "Everybody wanted to do
better this year."

not showing up for summer work-

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
CHICAGO - Junior defensive
tackle William Campbell's con-
tribution to the Michigan football
team can be summed up pretty
simply.
Underwhelming.
In two seasons, the five-star
recruit from Cass Tech High
School in Detroit has just five tack-
les and three pass break-ups to
his name. Little numbers for "Big
Will"
After flip-flopping between the
offensive and defensive lines last
season - something he also did in
high school - Campbell will play
the key role of three-technique
defensive tackle in 2011.
"His attitude and his mindset
has totally changed and gotten
better," senior defensive tackle
Mike Martin said Friday at the Big
Ten Media Days in Chicago. "And
he knows that he's in a spot where
he has to step up and be a big
part of this defense - our three-
technique. (Defensive coordina-
tor Greg) Mattison stressed when
he got here that if we don't have a
three-tech that can step up, we're
not going to be able to run the
defense. If we can't run it well,
we're not going to run it."
During the transition from for-
mer defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson's 3-3-5 defense to Mat-
tison's 4-3 set, Campbell has a big
spot to fill.
"He put the burden right on ....
Big Will and pretty much said, 'You
gotta do what you gotta do,' "Mar-
tin said. "Will has really stepped
up and answered the call. His work
ethic is as high as I've seen it, and
he's got his mind right."
Campbell becomes the defen-
sive tackle tasked with breaking
down the line of scrimmage with
his big body and eliminating the
risk of double teams on his line-
mate Martin, something the All-
Big Ten nose tackle can appreciate.
"It makes it easier onus,because
they can't double everyone," Mar-
tin said. "Someone's going to have
a one-on-one, when the pass comes
around. Someone's goingto be free
and has to get to the ball."
And if all goes according to plan,
opposing backs may find them-
selves in a world of hurt when they
hit the line this fall.
"When you've got guys getting

to the ball, it'slike, 'Who you gonna
block?"' Martin said.
Perhaps Campbell's most glar-
ing weakness is his fitness.
He's very mucha defensive line-
man trapped in an offensive line-
man's body.
"I think his whole mental aspect
is a defensive mind, but his ath-
leticism puts him on the offensive
line," Cass Tech coach Thomas
Wilcher said this month. "I love
his big body, I love his work ethic.
I know he's goingto be agreat foot-
ball player."
Added Martin: "He's a brick
house. That kid's really strong.
When I went against him when he
was on the scout team on offense,
he gave us a great look. I'm glad
we got him on our side of the ball
now."
Weight training this summer
has keyed on players' condition-
ing. And according to Martin*
and Michigan coach Brady Hoke,
Campbell has bought into the
training regimen and is seeing it
pay dividends.
The junior is listed at 6-foot-5,
333 pounds, but Hoke said Camp-
bell has dropped 17 or 18 pounds 0
already.
Hoke mentioned that he would
be happy toland at 320 pounds by
the season opener on Sept. 3.
"Still, I think that Will Campbell
will bump up our average weight
on the defensive line a little bit,"
Martin added.
Campbell was recruited as an
explosive, bruising rusher on the
line, and while that image has been
somewhat marred at Michigan,
Hoke knowsthe shinestillremains
somewhere underneath on this
blue-chip talent.
"I think Will has a tremen-
dous ability that's been a little bit
untapped - part of that is mov-
ing back and forth on both sides
of the ball and never really finding 6
a home," Hoke said. "I think he's
made strides, and if he continues,
he'll be a big part of our football
team."
It's hard for a 330-pound line-
man to go unnoticed. And Martin
will make certain that doesn't hap- *
pen - in workouts or on the field.
"I've always thought, 'Why
don't we have this guy incthe game,'
" Martin said. "(Campbell's) got no
excuses. He's going to be playing.
I'm in his ear all the time (saying)
I'm counting on him."

Robinson elaborates on reasons for return

Star quarterback
returns to lead
new-look M' squad
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
CHICAGO - On Brady Hoke's
first day as the Michigan football
team's coach, he lost the spotlight.
It wasn't with the media, who
packed the Junge Family Champi-
ons Center to cover his hour-long
press conference, but in a separate
meeting with his team.
With the cameras off, the Wol-
verines assembled for Hoke's first
address to the team. That's when
junior quarterback Denard Robin-
son got up. Robinson usually leads
by example alone - he couldn't do
that here.
He had a message: I'm not going
anywhere.
"The media was all saying, yeah
he might leave, but I never told
anybody I was leaving," Robinson
said at Big Ten Media Days. "So it
was just like I had to tell everybody
on the team like, 'Man, don't think
I'm leaving, don't read what every-

body says."'
The statement had a profound
impact on those in the room, one
that was remembered on the final
day of Big Ten Media Days on Fri-
day.
"It was something new, because
I've never seen Denard that angry
or that excited," senior defensive
"I've never
seen Denard
that angry or
excited."
tackle Mike Martin said. "But it
was a huge reassurance. But then
he transitioned into the team, like,
'What are we going to do as a team?
Where are we now? We can either
not be all in and do what we need
to do, or we can work hard together
and make sure we're successful."'
Hoke was also in the room. He
remembered Robinson being upset
at the media speculating his depar-

ture. He remembered fifth-year
senior center David Molk getting
up in that same meeting and telling
everybody the team was going to
stick together.
He remembered his first con-
versation with Robinson, which
ended with the quarterback saying,
"Coach, I'm not going anywhere."
And it doesn't appear Robin-
son is going anywhere for a long
time. When asked about making
the jump to the NFL, he said he
would address the issue when it
approached, but also reiterated
that he wanted to be the first per-
son in his family to have a col-
lege degree. He also wants to win
games, and to do that he needs his
teammates. Robinson didn't want
the young guys to relive what he
went through, coming to an under-
manned team after a summer of
mass exodus. Speaking now, but
leading by example at the same
time.
"When (Robinson) came to us,
he was addressing that we as a
group - including him - need to
make sure that none of the younger
guys have doubtful thoughts or
might want to stray away," Mar-
tin said. "We didn't want there to

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson spoke at team meeting to reassure his team.

be a repeat of last time there was a
transfer of a coach."
Safety Ray Vinopal and corner-
back Cullen Christian have trans-
ferred.
But the offseason has been noth-
ing compared to former coach Rich
Rodriguez's first, when both his
starting quarterback and a start-
ing offensive lineman left for other
schools. Michigan's scholarship
numbers are still low. Hoke said
he's at about 80 or 81 scholarship
players instead of the maximum

85. The lack of depth may be a con-
cern with Hoke's physical style. He
talked about having practices that
you only need to hear, creating a
"traditional" Michigan team.
That first edition of the tradi-
tional team will have an uncon-
ventional quarterback, but judging
from that meeting, a traditional
leader.

Fickell shows inexperience at Big Ten Media Days

Ohio State coach
prepares for first
season at the helm

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
CHICAGO - At Big Ten Media
Days on Thursday, Ohio State
coach Luke Fickell said the best
thing that happened to him after
he was hired - following all the
scandals with former quarterback
Terrelle Pryor and former coach
Jim Tressel - was that he "had no
time to sit and think."
Fickell was hired just a day
after Tressel was canned as head
coach at Ohio State.
Well, apparently the first-year
coach was so busy that he had no
time to look through the Media
Day schedule to get an idea of
what he was about to take part in,
either.
"I guess I thought it was a lun-
cheon," Fickel said of his first-

ever Media Day, a day loaded with
question and answer periods and
hundreds of media members. "I
thought you had to go up there,
it wasn't a question and answer
period, it was more of a talk."
For anyone keeping score, it
clearly says "Q&A" session on
the Media Day schedule. And
this wasn't exactly the first-ever
Media Day.
But regardless of Fickell's
naivete to the media day pro-
cess, he pinned his experience on
Thursday as a type of microcosm
of what he tries to preach to his
players as they embark on a new
era in Ohio State football.
"I like the mental challenges
at times just to see how you can
adapt to things," Fickell said.
"We try and get our guys, we
want to challenge them mentally
and throw them into situations
they're not prepared for to see
how they would react.
"Just not knowing (what's
going to happen), to me, that's

e on whatever new hurdles had in our coaching staff. The
thrown at it. He continu- experiences that we have had as

a staff over the last eight, nine, 10
years is invaluable."
One aspect Fickell can find
solace in is the Buckeyes' recent
dominance in one of the biggest
rivalries in all of sports; Ohio
State has beaten Michigan nine
out of the last 10 matchups.
But with new coaches at the
helm of both squads this year -
which is certainly rare - a whole
new era of The Game will be set to
begin this November. Both coach-
es understand the importance of
what will happen on Nov. 26.
"If you can't get geared up for
that and get goose bumps and all
those things for that game, then
you may not be human," Michigan
coach Brady Hoke said.
Fickell echoed Hoke's enthusi-
asm.
"Nobody will overlook that," he
said. "I know that's not something
that will ever be overlooked at
Ohio State."
Buckeye fans just better hope
Fickell is more seasoned than he
appeared at his Big Ten debut.
