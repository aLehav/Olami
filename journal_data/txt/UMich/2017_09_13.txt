An audience of 3,500 in 

Hill Auditorium burst into 
applause at the sight of The 
New York Times best-selling 
author Daniel Pink’s “Fear the 
Khaki” T-shirt on Tuesday 
evening. Pink donned the shirt 
as part of the first anecdote 
during his presentation, “The 
Mind of the Future: How 
to Survive an Outsourced, 
Automated Age.” Pink’s talk 
highlighted useful lessons on 
what it takes to be successful 
in the workplace as society 
shifts from the information 
age to the conceptual age.

Aside 
from 
an 
author, 

Daniel Pink is also a well 
known 
business 
strategist 

who was named one of the 
top ten business minds in the 
world by Thinkers50 in 2015. 
His TED Talk on science and 
motivation 
has 
also 
been 

viewed 
almost 
19 
million 

times. Pink also served as 
former 
Vice 
President 
Al 

Gore’s 
chief 
speechwriter 

from 1995 to 1997.

Pink’s presentation was a 

part of the Joseph and Sally 
Handleman Lecture Series, 
which presents the University 
of Michigan with the nation’s 
leading 
experts 
in 
areas 

of business, academia and 
government.

Business freshman Drew 

Tyson was one of the students 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 

lecture. Before the event, 
Tyson was looking forward 
to hearing Pink’s lessons — 
especially those concerning 
future success.

“I want to study finance 

and accounting and sort of 
how to manage your money 
and tips for being successful 
when I’m older, so I hope to 
learn some stuff about that,” 
he said, explaining how his 
interest in business prompted 
him to attend the event. 

Pink’s 
presentation 

highlighted Asia, automation 
and 
abundance 
as 
the 

three main challenges that 
individuals face in today’s 
economy. He reflected on 
how Asia’s large and capable 
population has resulted in 
outsourcing of many jobs 

University of Michigan Central 

Student Government convened 
Tuesday night, introducing the 
various initiatives of their executive 
committees for the academic year 
and passing revisions to the CSG 
Elections Code.

On par with a wider initiative of 

schools in the Big Ten Conference, 
CSG Vice President Nadine Jawad, 
a Public Policy senior, announced 
efforts for the University to partake 
in a University-side campaign to 
compete against other institutions 
to register students to vote as Sept. 
26 — National Voter Registration 
Day in the United States — 
approaches.

CSG President Anushka Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, redressed concerns 
among 
the 
assembly 
about 

registering students to vote in the 
state of Michigan, which may not 
be their permanent residency.

“We will not be encouraging 

people to be registered to vote in 
Michigan or Ann Arbor if this is 
not their regular residence because 
there are ethical concerns,” Sarkar

Ann Arbor City Council has 

revealed the master plan for 
a new state-of-the-art urban 
trail through the city.

The trail, which will be 

known as The Treeline: Allen 
Creek Urban Trail, began as 
a citizens’ initiative and has 
garnered wide support from 
City Council in the last two 
years. The current draft of 
the trail’s route spans 2.75 
miles and aims to connect 
the Huron River area of the 
city with downtown. It is 
expected to cost around $55 
million to complete.

Although trail routes are 

still tentative, the city hopes 
it will be able to connect the 
trail to the Border-to-Border 
trail, which runs alongside 

the Huron River and connects 
much of Washtenaw County 
by bike path. They also hope 
to make the trail adjacent to 
the University of Michigan 
campus.

City Administrator Howard 

Lazarus said the city is excited 
about the opportunities this 
new trail could bring, and 
thinks the creation of the trail 
will accomplish many goals 
Ann Arbor has set for itself. 

“It provides connections, 

ways for people to get around, 
opportunities 
for 
family 

recreations,” Lazarus said. “It 
can also be a nice development 
tool because in many cases 
it’s been proven that access 
to high quality bicycle and 
pedestrian 
facilities 
raise 

property values and make 
properties more attractive.”

At event at Mcity, Elaine Chao, other industry leaders talk safety and innovation

In a press conference Tuesday 

afternoon, 
United 
States 

Secretary 
of 
Transportation 

Elaine 
Chao 
unveiled 
the 

release of the department’s new 
guidance for automated driving 
system safety, titled A Vision 
for Safety 2.0. As part of an all 

day event, the press conference 
also 
welcomed 
Lieutenant 

Governor of Michigan Brian 
Calley; 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 

Dingell, D- Ann Arbor, Debbie 
Dingell; Mitch Bainwol, CEO 
and president of Alliance of 
Automobile 
Manufacturers; 

Mark Riccobono, president of 
the National Federation of the 
Blind; University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel; and 

Mcity Director Huei Peng.

The event was hosted at Mcity, 

a test site for driverless cars 
that opened on North Campus 
in July 2015. The site — which 
includes features necessary for 
standard transportation by car 
such as freeways, road signs 
and highway tunnels — has 
been used by companies such as 
Ford and was a pivotal resource 
in the debut of the first self-

driving passenger shuttle in 
North America.

“At Michigan, working with 

our partners in government 
and industry, we are driving 
the future of mobility towards 
a society that is safer, more 
sustainable and economically 
powerful for our state and 
nation,” Schlissel said during 
the conference.

After months of anticipation, Michigan 

Attorney General Bill Schuette announced 
the launch of his gubernatorial campaign 
Tuesday evening. Schuette already expected 
by political analysts to be the Republican 
frontrunner. 

Schuette made his announcement at 

the Midland County Fairgrounds in his 
hometown. He stressed his campaign will 
focus on income taxes, growing Michigan’s 
economy and helping the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act.

“Michigan needs leaders who are laser-

focused on jobs,” Schuette said, according 
to the Detroit Free Press. “More jobs, more 
paychecks, and more people.”

Schuette also said during the event the 

2018 gubernatorial election will present 
voters with a choice between economic 

stagnancy or growth.

“We must have a governor who won’t 

accept the fate assigned to us by the liberal 
elite, who look down on manufacturing,” 

Schuette said.

Schuette has faced criticism from both the 

left and right — mainly for his involvement 
with the Bush family and his support of 
President Donald Trump.

Regardless, Schuette is expected to be 

the GOP frontrunner and polls noted by 
the Detroit Free Press already suggest he 
has pulled ahead of former frontrunners 
Gretchen Whitmer and Geoffrey Fieger.

The idea of autonomous 

travel discussed by speakers 
highlighted current issues with 
automotive transportation and 
the goals that the Department 
of Transportation hopes to 
achieve with the release of their 
new federal guidance. Bainwol 
explained that more than 90 
percent of crashes are related 
to human error and the use of 
driverless cars will primarily 
address these issues — as well 
as provide for a cleaner, more 
efficient and more productive 
form of transportation.

The factors necessary to 

achieve such an autonomous 
future, 
Bainwol 
explained, 

include technology and public 
policy.

“The idea of autonomous 

cars has been a dream for a 
long time, but now, following 
decades of investment, it’s 
becoming a reality,” he said. 
“Policy can either harness 
and slow down innovations or 
it can help accelerate the life-
saving, life-changing benefits, 
and that’s why what Secretary 
Chao is announcing today is so 
significant.”

The 
speakers 
also 

emphasized 
the 
advantages 

such methods of transportation 
would 
provide 
those 
with 

disabilities, 
specifically 
the 

blind. Riccobono noted that 
while vision has always been a 
necessity for driving, a society 
in which automated vehicles 
are used by everyone would 
provide those with physical 
disabilities the opportunity to 
make use of these methods of 
transportation.

“Equal access to reliable, 

affordable, 
flexible 
and 

barrier-free 
transportation 

is one of the most significant 
obstacles 
preventing 
people 

with 
disabilities, 
who 

represent one out of every 
five Americans, from fully 

contributing their talents and 
achieving 
full 
integration 

in 
our 
communities,” 
he 

said. 
“The 
race 
to 
bring 

fully 
autonomous 
vehicles 

to America’s roads brings an 
unprecedented opportunity to 
ensure equal access for people 
with disabilities.”

When 
announcing 
the 

guidance, 
which 
includes 

aspects from previous policy 
but is updated with input 
from public comments and 
Congressional hearings, Chao 
explained how the information 
will help to ensure safety and 
effective practice by states and 
policymakers.

She stated that the vision “is 

not a static document,” and that 
the vehicles of tomorrow will 
continue to build upon policies 
established by the guidance. 
While today’s vehicles include 
many 
automated 
features, 

the future of transportation 
will include new computing 
powers, sensors and cameras.

“The 
future 
of 
this 

innovative, new technology is 
so full of promise,” she said. 
“It’s a future where vehicles 
increasingly help drivers avoid 
crashes. It’s a future where 
the time spent commuting is 
dramatically 
reduced, 
and 

where millions more, including 
the elderly and people with 
disabilities, 
gain 
access 
to 

the freedom of the open road. 
Especially important, it’s a 
future where highway fatalities 
and injuries are significantly 
reduced.”

A Vision for Safety 2.0, 

developed with the assistance 
of 
the 
National 
Highway 

Traffic Safety Administration, 
is laid out in new booklet. This 
replaces the previous Version 
1.0, otherwise known as the 
Federal Automated Vehicles 
Policy, and seeks to provide 
a productive path in which 
safe and effective automated 
vehicles 
can 
further 
be 

successful through four main 
objectives: the encouragement 
of 
new 
ideas, 
updating 

department 
processes 
by 

following 
private 
sector 

innovation 
and 
supporting 

partnership with the public 
and stakeholders in regard to 
this innovation and making 
use of the best practices and 
assistance for state legislators.

“As technology advances and 

the department gathers new 
and more information from 
stakeholders and consumers, 
we will continue to refine and 
update this guidance,” Chao 
said. “In fact, the department, 
and all of its modes, are already 
planning for Version 3.0 to be 
released in 2018.”

Chao also emphasized this is 

not an enforcement document 
and in conjunction with each 
state’s interest in legislating 
autonomous 
vehicles 
will 

continue 
to 
provide 
an 

approach for a world with 
increasing 
technological 

changes to make use of such 
resources for public efficiency 
and safety.

The 
new 
announcement 

mirrors 
legislation 
which 

was recently passed by the 
House of Representatives. In 
a statement released following 
the 
conference, 
Dingell 

expressed her support of the 
new measures.

“This 
updated 
policy 

guidance 
also 
compliments 

legislation passed unanimously 
in the House of Representatives, 
the SELF DRIVE Act, which 
establishes a framework for 
the regulation of self-driving 
vehicles for the first time,” 
Dingell said in the statement. 
“Automated vehicles have the 
potential to transform mobility 
in this country — improving 
our economy and saving lives 
on the road. This is a unique 
opportunity for members of 
both parties to come together 
to improve safety, support 
the auto industry’s comeback, 
and help create more cutting-
edge jobs in our state. Today’s 
announcement brings us one 
step closer to making this new 
technology a reality.”

may seem like a hefty price tag 
for a bike-and-pedestrian trail, 
Lazarus explained the costs 
are all in the name of safety.

“The master plan has a lot 

of great separated crossings, 
so that pedestrians don’t have 
to compete with cars to cross 
intersections,” 
he 
said. 
“I 

think that’s what gives some 
of the cost. Particularly when 
you get to the North Bank, the 
connection to the Border-to-
Border trail, there’s some pretty 
heavy infrastructure required.”

Furthermore, 
the 
city 
is 

exploring options of private 
funding so that the trail will not 
have to be funded entirely by 
taxpayers.

“We would find a way to set 

funding aside,” Lazarus said. 
“We want to look for grant 
opportunities as well. The city 
also does bring some property 
along the Border-to-Border trail 
that we could leverage for some 
secure funding.”

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

are excited about the new 
recreation and transportation 
opportunities 
the 
trail 
will 

bring 
them. 
According 
to 

Councilmember Jason Frenzel, 
D-Ward 1, who represents a 
large part of the city that the 
trail is slated to run through, 

citizens like the master plan 
because it ensures the trail will 
line up with the core values the 
city holds.

“The response kept getting 

more and more positive over 
time,” Frenzel said. “When I talk 
to the residents who have not 
been involved in that planning 
and they see it for the first time, 
they’re generally really, really 
positive. It’s shiny and cool-
looking, and it’s an innovative 
idea that holds Ann Arbor’s 
value sets with stewardship 
and 
active 
recreation 
and 

placemaking all to standard. I 
hear people excited because of 
those components.” 

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 

University 
is 
not 
quite 
as 

on 
board 
with 
the 
master 

plan as Ann Arbor residents. 
Lazarus said the school has 
some concerns about the trail 
interfering with its own master 
plan.

“We’re going to continue 

to work with them on that,” 
Lazarus said. “They are first 
and foremost an educational 
institution, so they need to be 
concerned with how to support 
their 
educational 
mission. 

But they do realize that the 
connection to the community 
is 
important 
to 
students, 

faculty, and visitors. … It’ll run 
along the periphery of campus. 
Having 
a 
facility 
students 

can use is important. At some 
point in the future it may cross 

through 
different 
parts 
of 

campus.” 

For his part, Kinesiology 

senior Connor Mora is excited 
for the trail. Though Mora will 
graduate before the trail is 
completed, as a member of the 
men’s cross country team, he is 
enthusiastic the opportunities 
it opens for the future team.

“Some of our routes can 

get 
pretty 
monotonous, 
so 

new routes are always very 
exciting,” Mora said. “The 
new track is being built right 
now, and it would be really 
convenient 
for 
the 
teams 

located in the South Campus 
area to be able to use the trail, 
too.”

Frenzel said the trail still has 

to undergo many stages before 
it can be used by citizens. 
City Council has accepted it 
for public comment, and staff 
will 
be 
seeking 
additional 

input from future stakeholders 
of the trail. Then the council will 
review the revised plan again, 
look for funding and then begin 
construction.

“I think it’s really important for 

people to recognize that a lot of the 
really big and important things 
that we have in our community 
have taken decades to implement,” 
Frenzel said. “We can do really big 
things on moderate time horizons. 
This is one of those things that will 
take a few years, but when we get it 
done it will be a treasure for this 
community.”

said.

She went on to reaffirm the motives of the 

committee and CSG as solely purposed in 
getting better student voter turnout rates in 
elections.

“The whole point of this is to get people to 

register to vote; we don’t really care where 
they’re voting,” Sarkar spoke.

Fulfilling an initiative outlined in their 

platform 
as 
candidates 
last 
semester, 

Jawad announced at assembly she will be 
meeting with the University’s Information 
Technology Services as soon as next week 
to discuss initiatives of installing Wi-Fi on 
Central Campus’s Diag.

With the widespread campaign efforts 

of the eMerge party during last winter, the 
Information and Technology Services began 
working on the initiative in June, Sarkar told 
the committee.

With due diligence, Sarkar told the 

committee that students could see Wi-Fi 
on the Diag as soon as the latter half of the 
Winter 2018 semester.

In rewriting Article VI of the University 

Election Commission, CSG also instituted 
the position of special prosecutor for Student 
Government elections, citing a need for a 
more impartial hearing process for parties 
filing complaints to the elections director.

Under the new position, the special 

prosecutor will serve as a petitioner for 
any case whose complainant requests and 
be responsible for gathering evidence and 
presenting cases at hearing before the 
elections counsel.

Additionally, the majority 

leader is interested in starting 
a signature-gathering effort to 
repeal existing wage laws.

State 
Senate 
Minority 

Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint

Flint still does not have 

clean water, landing a solution 
to the water crisis at the 
top of state Sen. Ananich’s 
agenda. In addition to local 
solutions, Ananich said he is 
intent on preventing similar 
water crises from happening 
around the state. He said 
despite Michigan having such 
large amount of fresh water, 
many communities have had 
issues with housing over the 
price of water, which he said is 
inacceptable.

“We need to protect all of 

our waterways, not just the 
Great Lakes,” Ananich said. 
“We shouldn’t have any more 
crises –– it happened to me 
personally and I have no other 
motivation than making sure 
it doesn’t happen to other 
people.”

For those who have had to 

endure the crisis, Ananich is 
hoping to establish a need-
based scholarship by the end 
of the year. The scholarship, 
named 
the 
Flint 
Promise, 

would make Flint the 11th 
city in Michigan designated 
a “promise zone,” or a city 
offering free tuition to those 
in need.

Ananich 
also 
said 
with 

so 
much 
insecurity 
in 

Washington, 
the 
state 
is 

looking 
to 
provide 
policy 

solutions 
for 
issues 
not 

federally 
addressed, 

such as price gouging in 
pharmaceutical companies.

State House Speaker Tom 

Leonard, R-DeWitt

State House Speaker Tom 

Leonard wrote in an email 
interview he has three top 
priorities for the fall, with 
mental health reform topping 

the list.

“This is a problem that does 

not have easy answers, but it 
is something we must address. 
I created a special task force 
this summer to travel around 
the state and talk to people 
who have been affected and 
learn what we can do to make 
a difference,” Leonard wrote.

Leonard 
also 
wants 
to 

support skilled trade schools, 
giving high school students 
more education options and 
adding more skilled labor to 

the economy.

“We created new options 

for high school students this 
spring, and we are working on 
new reforms to help prepare 
future students for the modern 
economy,” he said.

Like 
Meekhof, 
Leonard 

expressed interest in auto 
insurance reform, citing the 
same high rates.

“Michigan 
families 

currently 
pay 
the 
highest 

rates in the country for auto 
insurance, and it is not close. 
We have to do whatever we can 
to lower rates for Michigan 
drivers,” he said.

State Rep. Peter Lucido, 

D-Macomb

State 
Rep. 
Lucido 
has 

introduced the most bills this 
term compared to the rest of 
the Michigan representatives. 
Hoping to find solutions for 
auto 
insurance 
like 
many 

other 
congressmen, 
Lucido 

mentioned 
the 
need 
to 

efficiently 
create 
reform. 

He said that 22 percent of 
Michigan drivers currently do 
not have insurance, creating a 
sluggish Secretary of State.

“We will know when you 

got insurance, how long it 
was purchased for, and so it 
goes right from the company 
to the secretary of state,” 
Lucido said. “As soon as police 
officers pull you over, they 
will know whether or not you 
have insurance.”

In addition to predictions 

that 2018 will see legislation 
on medical marijuana, Lucido 
said alleviating the opioid 
epidemic requires continued 
education for doctors and 
patients, and that correction 
reform is needed.

“We currently spend $2 

million 
on 
corrections 
–– 

that’s too much,” he said.

that are based solely on 
routine.

Pink also noted many 

professions, 
such 
as 

accounting 
and 
law, 

are 
slowly 
becoming 

automated 
as 
the 

steps for each job are 
becoming 
more 
and 

more present on the 
internet. Finally, Pink 
explained 
the 
large 

amount of goods present 
in the country is also 
becoming 
problematic 

for the working class.

“There 
is 
this 

incessant need to come 
up with something new 
or 
create 
something 

better,” Pink said. 

Pink 
also 
touched 

on the importance of 
students 
becoming 

T-shaped; 
in 
other 

words, having not only 
a specialized knowledge 
of a certain subject, 
but also a more general 
understanding of other 
subjects.

He 
acknowledged 

the danger of hyper-
specialization in today’s 
economy, 
especially 

given how quickly it can 

change.

“You can specialize 

in 
a 
programming 

language 
that 
ends 

up 
disappearing, 
or 

you can specialize in 
a type of technology 
that ends up becoming 
obsolete pretty quickly,” 
he said. “I think that 
some specialization is 
okay, but I think hyper-
specialization 
at 
this 

age is really dangerous 
because the world is 
going to be different in 
20 years. What you need 
is a versatile portfolio of 
skills, a great mindset 
and the ability to learn.”

The 
presentation 

also 
highlighted 
the 

value of the arts and 
creativity 
in 
today’s 

economy. 
However, 

Pink acknowledged the 
challenge many of this 
generation’s 
students 

face in terms of feeling 
the need to focus only on 
developing logical skills, 
calling 
for 
educators 

to incorporate a multi-
faceted 
definition 
of 

subjects 
included 
in 

STEM fields.

“I think that we short-

sell STEM by thinking of 
it as a purely reductive 
linear thing — it’s not,” 
Pink 
said. 
“I 
think 

AUTHOR

We created 
new options

students 

this spring, 
and we are 
working on 
new reforms 

to help 

prepare future 

students for 
the modern 

economy 

that in our school system we 
often think of STEM as the AP 

biology where you’re answering 
multiple choice questions, when 
that’s not what STEM is. It’s 
exploration, experimentation, 

multidisciplinary, 
teams 

working together. You basically 
have to give your generation 
a reality check on what STEM 
actually is.”

Pink ended his talk with an 

explanation of benefits of the 
arts — specifically regarding 
composition, 
coordination 

and compassion. He explained 
while not everyone might be 
naturally gifted in areas like 
art or music, they can work 
towards 
having 
sufficient 

skills. He commended both the 
Ross School of Business and 
the University on taking an 
interdisciplinary approach to 
education.

“I think that being part of the 

overall University of Michigan 
is 
really 
valuable 
because 

tonight somewhere there was a 
dance performance, there was 

a play, there was a concert,” 
he said. “You’re not in just a 
specialized area. I think that 
Ross lodged in the context of 
the U of M is in a pretty good 
place.”

In terms of the future, Pink 

speculated the economy will 
focus more on a search for 
meaning.

“I think that one thing I can 

see happening is the economy 
becoming more focused on the 
search for meaning. I think that 
human beings in general want 
to live a life of meaning which 
can be hard to do if you’re just 
trying to survive, and if more 
people aren’t simply trying to 
survive you might encourage 
more people to try and find a 
sense of meaning.”

There is this 
incessant need 
to come up with 
something new or 
create something 

better,

W

hen I was around 
13 
years 
old, 
I 

became absolutely 

desperate to be in my 20s. 
I was just old enough to 
desire independence but still 
too immature to handle it. 
I imagined my 20s as this 
glittering time in my life when I 
would have my own apartment, 
spend my evenings partying 
and eventually meet the love 
of my life. I envisioned my 20s 
as the best decade of my life; 
I wouldn’t be burdened with 
children yet, and I would still be 
young and in shape. I would also 
have a high-power, high-paying 
job. I would never be alone, and 
my life would be magical. 

Though I’m not too far into my 

20s, I have to say this experience 
hasn’t been what I expected. 
From what I’ve seen so far, 
adulthood actually consists of 
living with roommates in cheap 
apartments, praying to find a 
well-paying job after graduation 
and using mobile apps to hook 
up with people you hope aren’t 
weird. 
Overall, 
this 
decade 

will most likely consist of 
inconsistency, of never settling 
in one place long enough to 
establish a community.

Once you make friends in 

one place, you find yourself 
moving again to a different 
city. And from what I’ve been 
told by those in their late 20s, 
life won’t really settle down 
until long after college is over. 
You move out of your parents’ 
home, try to make friends 
wherever you go and get 
used to being alone. Instead 
of being called “the most 
exciting decade of your life,” 
maybe this decade should be 
labeled “the loneliest decade 
of your life.”

This year, I’ll be a senior. 

Since starting college, I have 
switched living arrangements 
five times and moved permanent 
residences once. I believe this 
living situation is pretty normal 
for a college student, but the 
process of constantly changing 
homes creates a real feeling of 
isolation. When the people you 
usually see on a day-to-day basis 
suddenly change, you have to find 
comfort and a feeling of home 
inside yourself instead of in those 
around you.

I’ve 
come 
to 
recognize 

many aspects of my life — my 
possessions, my goals, even my 
friendships — as temporary. 
Upon 
graduating, 
I 
won’t 

know when I’ll see my friends 
in person again. What I once 
considered 
to 
be 
perennial 

facets of my daily life have now 
become temporary situations I’ll 
need to prepare to live without.

Yet I’ve also discovered 

there are some benefits of 
being lonely for an extended 
period of time. Of course, 
when you’re living in that 
solitary moment, it’s hard to 

see what good can come out of 
a long period of solitude. But 
nothing helps two people get 
to know each other better than 
being forced to spend a lot of 
time together; the same works 
for getting to know yourself. 
When you are forced to be alone, 
you learn a lot more about how 
you function, what your likes 
and dislikes are and thus how 
you can better succeed.

Without the influence of 

outside 
voices, 
you 
really 

begin to know what makes 
you, you. And I have found 
that a place or a city is most 
accessible not when I have a 
lot of friends there, but when 
I’m not afraid of exploring it 
on my own. True confidence 
and 
self-assurance 
don’t 

come from being surrounded 
by friends and family, but 
from knowing yourself well 
enough to be able to spend an 
extended period of time alone.

It’s true that my 20s haven’t 

quite 
yet 
lived 
up 
to 
the 

expectations I held when I was 
13. I’m not super rich and I don’t 
have a bajillion friends and as 
clichéd as this sounds, I’ve come 
to the awful understanding that 
our lives are not at all like the 
young-people sitcoms we used 
to watch. But every day I learn 
something new about myself, and 
every day I’m a little bit stronger, 
a little bit more confident for it. 
And even though I can’t wait 
until I’m (hopefully) financially 
and personally settled in my 
30s, I’m trying to enjoy the 
freedom and independence I 
know I only get to experience 
when I’m on my own.

When adulthood gets lonely

W

hen school is finally 
out 
and 
summer 

arrives, I often find 

myself browsing the latest 
trends. 
However, 

this 
summer 
I 

got a “real world” 
office 
job 
and, 

instead of looking 
for 
high-waisted 

shorts and tanks, 
I 
found 
myself 

looking for blazers 
and dress pants. 
After spending a 
small fortune on 
clothes that made 
me feel uncomfortable and 
look like a box, I thought it 
would be worth it. I had to look 
professional, right?

As women, we are sent 

many mixed signals on what 
it means to look professional. 
I remember standing in the 
bathroom between meetings 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
my 

internship, disgusted by the 
middle-aged woman I looked 
like I had become. I had never 
worn anything of this nature in 
my life, and this sudden change 
made me uncomfortable.

Through my experience as a 

young woman in a professional 
workplace, I found that having 
a lot of options regarding ways 
to dress myself can serve as 
a positive opportunity for 
personal expression. But upon 
further analysis I have come 
to realize all the ways this 
freedom 
puts 
unnecessary 

burdens on women in the 
workplace.

On my first day, I quickly 

noticed that men did not go 
through the same stress of 
getting dressed for work as 
women do. Growing up, boys 
are dressed by their parents 
in button-downs and khakis 
from the age of 3. By the time 
they enter the workplace, they 
know exactly how to present 
themselves to the professional 
world. They have been dressing 
the same way their entire lives. 
The same attire they wear to a 
wedding or celebration could 
be worn to the office as well.

As a woman, I have found 

liberation in my outfit choices, 

but I also have encountered 
mixed signals when deciding 
what is appropriate to wear 
to a certain gathering. When 

reading 
the 
words 

“business 
casual” 

in an email from a 
potential 
employer, 

my mind floods with 
outfit 
possibilities. 

Should I wear a blazer 
and 
pants? 
Dress 

pants or casual jeans? 
Flats or heels? Will 
they think I am a 
tramp if my heels are 
too high? What about 

the length of my skirt? Will 
they be offended if I show my 
shoulders?

I guarantee my boyfriend 

does not ask himself that many 
questions when he gets ready 
for an interview. The fashion 
industry 
makes 
a 
fortune 

off marketing each season’s 
“hot new look” to the female 
consumer, so they provide 
her 
with 
endless 
options. 

Thank you, Macy’s, I really do 
appreciate it, but the pressure 
I feel to “dress my best” cannot 
be eliminated by shopping at 
your semi-annual sale.

Women 
must 
constantly 

decide what outfit will best suit 
the situation. The way women 
are traditionally represented in 
fashion advertisements is often 
what one would expect to see in 
the bedroom, not the cubicle. 
Despite the stereotypes and 
implications women have in 
society, many women strive for 
equality between the sexes in 
the workplace.

In the ’70s, fashion designers 

recognized what these women 
were missing, and thus, the 
pantsuit rose to popularity. 
Pantsuits 
allowed 
women 

to dress just like their male 
counterparts in a demand for 
equal respect in the workplace. 
For centuries, it was frowned 
upon 
for 
women 
to 
wear 

pants, let alone a masculine-
looking suit. The pantsuit led 
the way for women to dress in 
a professional style that was 
similar to men’s, and it made 
headway in the fight for equal 
rights. However, as time went 

on and fashion evolved after 
the pantsuit hit stores, women 
were bombarded with mixed 
signals about what it meant 
to dress “business casual.” 
Blazers and skirts became a 
smashing combo for the office, 
and loafers became acceptable 
for women to wear to work.

I have found that, depending 

on the office environment, 
the norms for what women 
wear can be vastly different. 
Working at a tech startup 
versus 
working 
for 
the 

government calls for women to 
dress in vastly different ways. 
However, no matter the office 
environment, most of what 
men wear remains the same. 
Formal or casual, he will most 
likely to be pressured to wear a 
shirt with a collar.

I have found that one’s 

comfort 
should 
not 
be 

compromised by what one 
might 
be 
pressured 
into 

wearing to work. Out of all 
the boxy clothes I bought for 
my summer job, I ended up 
wearing dark pants and a white 
blouse nearly every day. It 
became my summer uniform.

Strangely, I found freedom 

in not having to think about 
what to wear to work every 
day. That is probably the way 
men feel, too. I could go to 
work focused on what I needed 
to accomplish that day, rather 
than worrying if my necklace 
matched my shoes.

As women, we have more 

freedom than men in deciding 
what 
to 
wear. 
The 
ever-

evolving 
fashion 
industry 

leaves it up to us to choose 
which pieces best fit our 
style and the occasion. This 
summer, 
without 
intending 

to, I ended up taking comfort 
in wearing basically the same 
outfit to work every day, and 
it was strangely liberating. 
Perhaps all the choices women 
encounter in selecting just the 
right outfit, while fun, ignore 
the fact that we are also in the 
office to work.

 

The importance of admitting ignorance

Redefining business casual

MICHELLE PHILLIPS| COLUMN

I 

am fortunate enough to 
surround 
myself 
with 

people who are generally 

politically 
motivated, 
left-

leaning individuals. I live in 
a co-op filled with murals 
praising liberal and socialist 
views. I frequently visit Metal 
Frat, a place where it often 
seems difficult to visit without 
having a political conversation. 
I write for The Michigan Daily, 
a clearly liberal-leaning college 
newspaper. I’m majoring in Arts 
and Ideas, a major where my 
class conversations about art 
often lead to discussions about 
the art’s impact on the political 
climate during its conception. 

Through 
all 
of 
this, 
I 

have talked to many people 
who I view as being both 
intellectually superior to me 
and much more informed on 
the current political climate 
than I am. I like to pride myself 
on staying fairly well-informed 
and educated, yet I do often 
find myself in circumstances 
where I cannot keep with the 
conversation. Here is where I 
try to admit my ignorance and 
attempt to learn.

If there’s one thing I’m 

passionate about when it comes 
to politics, it’s caring. You have 
to care about something. No 
matter what specific issues 
you’re passionate about, as long 
as you have that passion, that’s 
what matters. Apathy is the 
enemy of progress and dialogue.

I can accept disagreeing 

with someone, but I cannot 
accept 
them 
not 
being 

involved in the conversation. 
I 
have 
talked 
to 
several 

friends who try to stay out 
of politics. When I asked 
them why they don’t have 
opinions, the answer I hear 
time and time again is that 
they are afraid of not knowing 
information during a debate 
or conversation.

This is quite understandable. 

In a world where we are in 

constant contact with others, 
losing face is a scary thing. 
Yet however understandable it 
may be, it does not excuse the 
action. One way to help cure 
this phenomenon would be 
to normalize the admittance 
of ignorance.

I 
remember 
a 
specific 

moment not too long ago when 
rumors first started spreading 
that President Donald Trump 
was going to end Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals. 
I admittedly had no idea what 
DACA was at the time, but 
two of my classmates were 
very fired up about the issue. 

I think that even only a 
year ago, I would have kept 
quiet, alienating myself from 
these two people and fearing 
judgement, but this time I 
spoke up and inquired about 
DACA. This simple action 
made me feel like I was part 
of the conversation and less 
intimidated from intellectual 
political discourse.

The only way anyone can 

learn about economic and 
social issues is if they are 
taught, whether that’s through 
academia 
or 
their 
peers. 

Knowledge does not magically 
appear into someone’s head. 
If people become less afraid 
of not knowing, then maybe 
they will become more eager 
to learn.

This is particularly hard 

on our campus here at the 
University of Michigan, where 

most of us pride ourselves 
on 
our 
intelligence 
and 

individuality. If someone feels 
that either of those things has 
the potential of being taken 
away from them, they would 
more likely not speak than 
risk the loss.

As a community, we need 

to make people feel more 
comfortable with admitting 
their ignorance on a topic 
without 
feeling 
like 
their 

intelligence is being insulted. 
Hopefully, this will encourage 
people to participate more in 
current political dialogue. 

If there ever was a time 

to participate, it’s now. The 
current 
political 
climate 

almost doesn’t feel like real 
life at this point. Often when I 
read the news I have to remind 
myself that this isn’t a movie 
and we can’t just take the film 
out of the projector.

Trump blazed a trail of 

unrealistic promises and hate 
across the campaign trail. 
Now, over 200 days into his 
presidency, 
our 
country’s 

reality is worse than most of 
us could have even imagined. 
I know a lot of people who 
didn’t vote during the 2016 
presidential election because 
they were still sucked into 
their own apathy. Now is the 
time to come together, to 
learn and to make our country 
a better place. We can’t do 
that without votes.

Decisions 
on 
every 

level of government affect 
our 
community, 
whether 

transparent or not. I am still 
very uninformed on local and 
state politics. I hope to learn a 
lot more about the lower levels 
of 
government 
during 
my 

junior year at the University. 
I hope to take that knowledge 
and share it with anyone that 
is willing to listen.

‘You’re the Worst’ returns for it’s fourth season
‘You’re the Worst’ deals 
with post-breakup woes

FXX show returns for its fourth season with its signature dark 
comedy delivering laughs with a few stumbles along the way

One 
of 
the 
defining 

characteristics 
of 
“You’re 

the Worst,” Stephen Falk’s 
brilliantly 
underrated 
anti-

rom-com, is that it embraces 
and subverts conventions at the 
same time. The story’s central 
protagonists — arrogant British 
novelist Jimmy (Chris Geere, 
“After 
Earth”) 
and 
selfish 

music rep Gretchen (Aya Cash, 
“Easy”) — are essentially the 
antithesis of a gung-ho healthy 
relationship. And yet, with 
their toxic personalities and 
regressive 
attitudes, 
they’re 

made for one another.

Throughout the series — now 

entering its fourth season — 
the two have reached almost 
every possible “normal couple” 
milestone: moving in together, 
declaring 
their 
love 
and 

proposing marriage. But with 
each milestone, Jimmy and 
Gretchen found themselves in 
quiet emotional turmoil, both 
uncertain 
for 

their 
future 

together 
and 
unable 

to 
properly 

communicate 
their anxieties. 
Given 
how 

Jimmy 
impulsively 
backtracked 
his proposal to 
Gretchen 
and 

abandoned her 
in last season’s 
(literal 
and 

figurative) 
cliffhanger 
finale, 
the 

prospect 
for 
their 

reconciliation 
looks 
dim. 

Fortunately, 
despite 
the 

abrupt 
end 

to 
their 

already fragile 
romance, there 
may be some compelling soul-
searching on the horizon for 
this season.

Unlike 
the 
chaotic, 

sometimes wayward season 
three, the newest season of 
“You’re the Worst” opens on 
a much more confident note. 
The premiere’s hour-long two-
parter, “It’s Been,” allows some 
breathing room for the show’s 
often fast-paced setup. Each 
part, both written and directed 
by Falk, cleverly splits time 
between Jimmy and Gretchen 
three 
months 
after 
their 

unexpected breakup, and how 
they’ve coped with the trauma 

of ending their relationship.

The 
stunning 
first 
half 

showcases 
a 
scruffy 
and 

laconic Jimmy adjusting to a 
completely new environment 
in upstate California. Squatting 
in a trailer park community for 
seniors, Jimmy has chosen a 
simpler life for himself, going so 
far as to completely 
disconnect 
from 

technology 
altogether. 
Even 

with his newfound 
bachelor lifestyle, 
he still projects an 
unfulfilled desire 
for connection onto 
Bert 
(Raymond 

J. 
Berry), 
a 

misanthropic 
local who would 
rather watch crime 
procedurals 
with 

Jimmy than get boba tea with 
his chummy neighbors.

During 
an 
entertaining 

subplot in which Jimmy helps 
Bert retrieve his stolen car keys, 
Jimmy finally sees just how 
reckless Bert can be on his own. 

He 
realizes 

he 
must 
not 

only 
re-enter 

civilization for 
the sake of his 
own sanity, but 
also 
confront 

the issues he 
left behind so 
he doesn’t grow 
into a detached 
hermit 
like 

Bert. 
This 

uneasiness 
is 
best 

exemplified 
when 
Jimmy 

decides 
to 

turn his dusty 
iPhone 
back 

on, 
only 
to 

be 
hit 
with 

an 
anxiety-

inducing 
symphony 
of 

text 
message 

and voicemail 
notifications 
from Gretchen.

While Jimmy comes to his 

senses, the second half of the 
episode finds Gretchen in a 
manic state. Her portion of 
the episode, though hilarious 
and equally harrowing, is not 
nearly as emotionally potent 
as 
the 
first 
part. 
Instead 

of 
shrinking 
back 
into 
a 

depression like in season two, 
Gretchen opts for a hyperactive 
persona, 
which 
includes 

speedily reciting ‘90s hits like 
the 
Cranberries’ 
“Zombie” 

and the Barenaked Ladies’ 
“One Week,” smoking a bowl 
of crack and drawing dinosaur 
murals to pass the time. The 

episode’s funniest scenes occur 
during Gretchen’s story, but 
Gretchen’s compulsive craving 
for stimulation falls somewhat 
flat in comparison to Jimmy’s 
dramatic plot. She ends up 
crawling back to her ex, Ty 
(Stephen 
Schneider, 
“Broad 

City”), making for a plausible 

yet 
predictable 

character 
development.

Most 
of 

the 
winning 

moments in this 
episode belong 
to 
the 
series’ 

incredible 
supporting 
players, 
the 

hedonistic 
Lindsay (Kether 
Donohue, “Pitch 
Perfect”) 
and 

the 
sincere, 
pot-smoking 

veteran 
Edgar 
(Desmin 

Borges, 
“Carrie 
Pilby”). 

In contrast to Jimmy and 
Gretchen’s 
individual 
and 

joint dysfunction, Lindsay and 
Edgar work well together and 
on their own, with Lindsay 
temping as a fashion assistant 
and Edgar as a sketch comedy 
writer. But after Lindsay and 
Edgar end up in bed together, 
the two inadvertently become 
friends 
with 
benefits, 
a 

deal that feels like a subtle 
foreshadowing of relationship 
problems 
ahead 
for 
these 

characters. But it’s good to see 
that Lindsay and Edgar have 
found some inner peace after 
going through some emotional 
turbulence in previous seasons.

“It’s 
Been” 
continues 
to 

display “You’re The Worst”’s 
trademark 
mix 
of 
black 

comedy and pathos, furthering 
Falk’s nuanced portrayal of 
modern romance and mental 
illness. It would have been 
nice 
if 
Gretchen 
had 
the 

ample plot that Jimmy had, 
especially 
since 
her 
story 

doesn’t hit as many strong 
emotional beats. Regardless of 
the episode’s slight imbalance, 
it conveys a solid illustration 
of the limitations of their 
post-breakup 
solitude. 
Like 

Jimmy and Gretchen, there’s 
a 
strong, 
lonesome 
heart 

beating underneath the show’s 
cynical, twisted shell. The 
characters are continuing to 
develop into complex people 
and veer away from the self-
destructive 
behavior 
that 

dictated their actions before. 
It’ll be hard to know how long 
the show will last, given how it 
primarily revolves around the 
fate of Jimmy and Gretchen’s 
relationship. But here’s hoping 
that “You’re the Worst” keeps 
being the best.

TV REVIEW

SACRED BONES RECORDS

Zola Jesus. Yeah.
Zola Jesus’s ‘Okovi’ is 
intimate yet existential

Zola Jesus brings an expansive, dynamic sound to her fifth 
studio album in which she explores questions of fear and doubt

Cathedrals 
always 
seem 

to 
inspire 
awe 
in 
a 
way 

independent 
of 
religious 

affiliation. The infinite reach 
of 
soaring 
ceilings 
infuses 

grandeur into the air; curved 
arches cradle simple elegance 
in their graceful lines. A hush 
stretches indefinitely through 
the gaps of pews: a space for 
reverence and reflection.

“Doma,” the first track off 
 

Nika Roza Danilova’s (recording 
under the name Zola Jesus) fifth 
studio album, Okovi, ignites a 
similar sort of introspection. 
Compositionally, 
the 
track 

is sparse: the harmony of 
ambiguous vocals and white 
noise 
fades 
in 

and 
out. 
Yet, 

despite 
its 

uniformity, 
the 

song 
captivates. 

Its gossamer hum 
creates a space for 
Danilova’s voice 
to 
reverberate 

into 
towering 

points and lofty 
canopies — the 
faint outline of a 
cathedral begins 
to 
take 
shape. 

“Doma” 
flickers 

like a candle at 
the altar of Okovi, 
introducing 
a 

deeply personal album awash in 
unrestrained layers of emotion.

From “Doma,” Zola Jesus 

wastes no time developing its 
hazy form into a solid presence. 
The second track, “Exhumed,” 
pulls the original flat ambiance 
into a dynamic collision of 

cutting 
instrumentals 
and 

feverous 
beats. 
If 
“Doma” 

was the consistent gray of an 
overcast sky, “Exhumed” is a 
torrential 
downpour, 
primal 

and inhibited. In this sudden 
expansiveness, Danilova is a 
powerhouse: projecting, “Bury 
the tongue between the teeth 
/ Open the jaw and sink in 
deep” from the heavens with 
an intensity that splinters and 
a desperation that is almost 
overwhelming; 
a catharsis that 
threatens to wash 
away the earth.

“Exhumed” 

flows into “Soak,” 
a 
track 
that 

maintains 
the 

same 
forceful 

undercurrent of sincerity but 

mellows 
from 

the 
jagged 

explosiveness 
of 
“Exhumed.” 

Withdrawn 
tempos 
and 

controlled 
rhythms 
create a muted 
repetitiousness 
that 
forms 

a 
sense 
of 

disillusionment; 
deadweight 
hangs from every 
aspect of “Soak.” 
The 
overall 

lifelessness 
of 
the 
sound 

corresponds 
with 
the 

hopelessness 
of 
the 
lyrics 

themselves, 
exploring 
the 

futility of life.

It’s a bleak perspective; one 

that is quickly contested through 
songs “Witness” and “Siphon.” 
Both hold a more hopeful 

sentiment. The simple balance 
between 
Danilova’s 
vocals 

and the quiet instrumental 
background weaves a desire 
for others to see their own 
potential into the melody of 
“Witness;” 
the 
unyielding 

chorus of “‘Cause we’d rather 
clean the blood of a living man 
/ We’d rather lean over, hold 
your warm, warm hand / We’d 
love to clean the blood of a 
living man / We’d hate to see 

you give into those 
cold, dark nights 
inside your head” 
in “Siphon” fights 
against apathy and 
self-destruction. 
The dramatic shift 
in 
temperament 

between 
“Soak” 

and 
“Witness” 
or 
between 

“Siphon” 
and 
the 
darkly 

existential 
questionings 
of 

the song “Veka” is abrupt and 
unexplained. 

Zola 
Jesus 
seems 
to 

be 
debating 
with 
herself, 

ruminating on the meaning 
of life under the inevitability 
of death. Her songs offer no 
answers, 
only 
half-finished 

explorations 
of 
contrasting 

arguments.

The jumble of incongruity 

is difficult to keep up with, yet 
powerful all the same. 

More than anything, Okovi is 

an album created by Zola Jesus 
for herself. Rather than a concise 
narrative, it is a passionately 
pieced-together collection of 
intimate thoughts and past 
experiences. Fears, doubts and 
unanswerable questions come 
together to form a holy ground, 
a place where the shackles that 
burden Zola Jesus start to feel a 
little bit lighter.

ALBUM REVIEW

It’s been about three 

years since Sam Smith’s 
In 
the 
Lonely 
Hour 

debuted and the world 
was 
introduced 
to 
his 

somewhat 
cheesy 
(yet 

entirely 
beautiful) 
“Sad 

Boy” persona. Now, in 2017, 
Sam Smith is just as sad.

In the three years of 

his fame, Smith jumped 
between crooning about 
past 
relationships 
over 

soulful 
instrumentation 

and 
belting 
with 

Disclosure on the duo’s most popular tracks. 
On his new single “Too Good At Goodbyes,” 
Smith finds a happy medium between 
“Stay With Me” and “Latch.” Co-written 
with Stargate, the production duo behind 
everything from Beyonce’s “Irreplaceable” 
to Rihanna’s “S&M,” the track has a slight 
R&B undertone. Smith opens with just his 
voice and piano, followed by a progressive 
layering of light strings and snaps. About 
1:15 in, a head-bobbing bass guitar comes in 
over a simple bass drum beat, showcasing 
Stargate’s R&B expertise. Smith’s voice 
sounds phenomenal and sheds light on his 
extensive range, despite a setback from vocal 
cord surgery. A friend of mine even compared 

his voice on “Too Good At Goodbyes” to a 
saxophone. That rings true, especially on the 
chorus.

Lyrically, “Too Good At Goodbyes” is 

classic Sam Smith. He describes how a past 
lover hurt him so many times that he’s now 
adept at moving on (essentially the motif of 
In the Lonely Hour). The single is nothing 
new in terms of content, but instrumentally 
Smith delivers a welcomed update to his 
usual, string-heavy production. He’s still 
sad, but sadness and Sam Smith are like 
Rihanna and sex-appeal – it’s just innate.

DAILY COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

A lesson from 
the Inklings

Columnist Bailey Kadian talks about 

her time with Inklings at Oxford 

I often think to myself, 

Maybe this doesn’t make any 
sense.

You may ask what “this” 

refers to. “This” can be a lot 
of things. My career, my goals, 
how I see the next ten years 
of my life unfolding, how I 
plan to use my time, how I 
currently use my time, what I 
wish I could get more involved 
in, what I think should happen 
in my life, what is happening 
in my life. The list goes on.

Over the years, I 

have drawn a parallel 
between how I see 
the 
trajectory 
of 

my life and what I 
believe would be the 
most logical way to 
compose its course. 
I have viewed my 
education, 
and 

the 
experiences 

that 
surround 
it, 

as 
an 
entity 
that 

requires a clear, set 
path. I worry that 
my 
studies 
don’t 

necessarily 
align 

with 
my 
long-term 
goals, 

like one day maybe owning a 
business or having a family. 
I have muddled the idea of 
freedom in my education with 
a belief that my future has to 
be practical or “make sense.” I 
have put school in one category 
of learning and everything 
else, like volunteering or social 
events, in another.

It has taken some time to 

unravel such a view of things.

This past summer, I had the 

opportunity to study at Oxford 
and during my time abroad, I 
experienced a taste of what it 
was like to move my education 
outside of its usual constraints. 
I met many different students, 
with 
different 
interests, 

dreams and passions. I went 
into the program thinking: as 
an English major, studying at 
an institution such as this one, 
with faculty of such value, I 
will be able to further engage 
in my study of literature, 
and 
better 

understand 
its place in my 
education.

Many of those 

initial 
hopes 

did 
come 
to 

fruition, but not 
in a conventional 
way. 
The 

experience 
of 

learning 
in 
a 

new place, with 
new 
people, 

taught me more 
than 
anything 

out of a book or 
lecture. 
When 

you are thrown 
into an entirely 
new 
setting 

and 
forced 
to 

adapt, you learn 
the most about 
yourself. I don’t 
mean to project 
this 
in 
some 

cliché 
form 
of 

traveling abroad 
to “find myself.” 
I mean that while 
you are abroad, surrounded by 
new people, you start to see the 
way you view your life outside 
of its usual structures. When 
those boundaries blurred a bit, 
what I found was invaluable.

In 
class, 
I 
saw 
the 

differences that bring students 
together to study a certain 
author or text. We came at it 
from different angles, yet we 
found commonalities across 
what moved us and why. I 
took a course on the Inklings, 
a group of writers who met 
as a weekly literary group in 
Magdalen 
College. 
Among 

them were C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. 
Tolkien, Owen Barfield and 
Charles Williams.

Some students loved “The 

Lord of the Rings,” some were 
fascinated by Lewis’s religious 
writings 
and 
others 
were 

particularly interested in each 
writer’s ties to Oxford and 
their lasting legacy.

The Inklings met to discuss 

their writings, their lives, 
ideas 
and 
dreams. 
These 

writers moved learning into a 
category of living. That is what 
I believe my experience was. 
Beyond sitting in a classroom 
and reading the texts of these 
writers, we found that the 
learning was woven through 
every experience. I learned 
the most about people and 
their lives while sitting on 
the lawn before dinner, or 

riding on a bus to 
an excursion. Yes, 
many of us had 
similar interests in 
literature, but my 
love for Lewis was 
vastly 
different 

than 
others’ 

interest in Tolkien, 
or love for fantasy. 
We learned from 
one 
another 

because of these 
differences.

Our 
education 

stretches 
far 

beyond the limits 

of a course or field of study. 
What I saw before as a failure 
in finding a clear path to my 
future, I now recognize needs 
to be reordered. There is no 
such thing as one way to learn, 
or one way to follow a passion. 
However, there is one way to 
miss it. We can remain too 
limited in what we know or 
what we have grown used to. 
That makes us unable to see 
our need for something new.

When Tolkien and Lewis 

met among the other Inklings, 
they didn’t just sit and confirm 
what they already believed to 
be true. They pushed against 
their views of fantasy, religion, 
romance and language. By 
studying the way these writers 
engaged with each other and 
challenged each other, I feel 
I need to implement these 
habits in my own educational 
experience. The Inklings saw 
one another as teachers, and 
greatly valued every opinion 

about 
their 

work. 
The 

fellowship 
of this group 
encourages 
me to consider 
who I surround 
myself 
with, 

and 
how 

willing 
I 
am 

to learn from 
them.

We 
become 

comfortable 
— and remain 
fixed — in a 
lifestyle 
that 

makes 
sense 

to us, or aligns 
with 
our 

goals. But we 
need 
things 

to disrupt our 
positions. 
We 

need people to 
question 
why 

we 
believe 

what 
we 

believe, or love 
what we love. It 
is only in those 

moments that we can firmly 
hold onto the very ideals we 
build our lives upon. While 
surrounded by so many people, 
you cling to common interests, 
and possibly diverge on certain 
principles. But through the 
common thread of accepting 
the experience, you are forced 
to grow.

In reflection of his time 

with 
the 
Inklings, 
Lewis 

once wrote, “What I owe to 
them all is incalculable.” Use 
those around you to grow 
and learn, and allow the 
views 
that 
challenge 
your 

own to teach you more about 
yourself. Dismissing such an 
opportunity for the sake of 
comfort robs you of plenty. 
Once you abandon the rigid 
track you feel you must follow 
and look outside of it — you’ll 
likely find your path more 
transparent than ever before.

One night only event!
‘The B-Side’ overstays its welcome

Documentary provides nuanced if not long-winded look at a beat photographer

The latest documentary from 

Errol Morris (“The Unknown 
Known”) is much too long for 
its subject matter. At the center 
of “The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman’s 
Portrait Photography” is a now 
eighty-year-old woman who 
moved to New York in 1959, took 
up photography and ended up 
capturing many seminal Beat 
generation 
figures 
through 

her camera lens. Among her 
most impressive works is a 
series of 1975 photographs 

featuring Bob Dylan and Allen 
Ginsberg. Later, 
she 
became 

Ginsberg’s 
trusted 
photographer, 
capturing 
him 

as 
he 
aged. 

Dorfman 
turned to more 
commercial, 
family-oriented 
portrait 
photography 
as 
she 
settled 

in 
Cambridge, 

MA, where she 
now lives. Dorfman continues 

to use large-format Polaroid 

photography, even 
past the format’s 
popularity.

But 
while 

Dorfman’s 
life, 

especially in the 
1960s, is naturally 
intriguing, 
Morris’s 
documentary 
is 
cinematic 

overkill. Even at 
a 
lean 
seventy-

six minutes, the 
film feels at least 
half an hour too 

long, and at times more of an 

advertisement for Dorfman’s 
services from a friend rather 
than a prodding examination 
of lives and cultures one can 
expect from a documentarian 
of Morris’s stature. That’s 
not to say the whole film is 
a bust — Dorfman is a warm 
personality 
who 
offers 
a 

rather unique perspective on 
a closely-studied generation of 
people, and her photography 
is as compelling as herself 
— but the film may feel more 
at home as an informative 
program running on a helpful 
television next to a temporary 
art exhibit.

BAILEY 
KADIAN

By studying 

the way 

these writers 

engaged 
with each 
other and 
challenged 
each other, I 
feel I need to 
implement 
such habits 
in my own 
educational 
experience

The case for Wilton Speight

W

hen Wilton Speight 
steps up to the 
podium, he exudes 

a quality few college athletes 
— let alone students — 
possess in the face of intense 
criticism: professionalism. 

Saturday 

was no 
different. 
Michigan 
coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
described 
the natural 
butterflies 
this 
youthful 
team must 
overcome.

Speight is one of a few 

exceptions.

As a redshirt freshman, 

he won a game on the road, 
at night, with his team down 
five in the fourth quarter 
against Minnesota.

Nearly a year later, he 

threw the 40-yard touchdown 
pass that beat then-No. 8 
Wisconsin.

Seven games later, he 

started on the road against 
Ohio State with a shoulder he 
wouldn’t admit was injured — 
but undoubtedly was — only 
to come three points shy in a 
heartbreaker.

“When mistakes are made, 

nothing’s gonna faze him,” 
said fifth-year senior center 
Patrick Kugler. “After a big 
play, he’s not super high 
or super low. He’s a poised 
leader out there. Especially 
in the huddle, you know 
that he has a 
command that 
you want to 
follow him.”

And for 

that reason, 
the redshirt 
junior is — and 
should remain 
— Michigan’s 
starting 
quarterback.

I’m not going 

to make excuses 
for Speight.

This season, he has 

underperformed, plain and 
simple, no doubt about it.

He threw two pick-sixes 

in Michigan’s season opener 
against Florida.

He should be absolved 

for the first. The pass hit 
sophomore wide receiver 
Kekoa Crawford’s hands and 
cornerback Duke Dawson 
took it to the house.

The other was his fault. 

Speight sailed a ball over 
Grant Perry’s head and 
cornerback CJ Henderson 
made him pay for the mistake.

Against Cincinnati, he 

fumbled twice — both on 

botched handoffs.

On the first, Speight tried 

to hand the ball off with one 
hand — something Harbaugh 
said he repeatedly cautioned 

his quarterback 
against doing. 
He warned 
that it would 
eventually 
come back to 
bite him. It 
finally did.

The second 

came on an 
end-around 
attempt 
intended for 
Crawford. The 

play ended with Cincinnati 
recovering a fumble. Speight 
was fortunate that his defense 
bailed him out with three 
straight stops.

Through two games, 

Speight is 28-for-54 for 402 
yards, three touchdowns 
and two interceptions. At 
this point last year, he was 
35-for-50 for 457 yards, 
seven touchdowns and one 
interception.

Hawaii and Central Florida 

aren’t Florida and Cincinnati, 
though.

Still, this is Speight’s 

second year under center. 
With that experience comes 
higher expectations, and 

with good reason. Many are 
waiting to see Speight take 
a game over. He hasn’t done 
that yet — not even close.

And when Harbaugh 

briefly sat Speight against the 
Gators, it was supposed to be 
an opportunity for Speight to 
gather himself, settle into the 
flow of the game and examine 
Florida’s defense.

The strategy worked. In the 

first series of the second half, 
he went 5-for-7 for 52 yards 
on a crucial touchdown drive.

Speight’s time on the 

sideline may have opened up 
the dialogue of a quarterback 
competition when there isn’t 
one at all.

Monday afternoon became 

the most recent 
instance that 
Harbaugh has 
publicly backed 
Speight.

“Wilton’s 

the starting 
quarterback,” 
he said.

Yet, the 

other options 
at quarterback 
remain 
unrealistically 
romanticized.

John O’Korn’s 

underwhelming performances 
against Indiana in 2016 

and against Florida in the 
opener are suddenly being 
chalked up to a case of small 
sample size worthy of further 
experimentation.

Brandon Peters’ 

unexpectedly strong 
performance in Michigan’s 
Spring Game suddenly seems 
very appealing.

Even true freshman 

Dylan McCaffrey is drawing 
intrigue, with talk of 2017 
being a year to rebuild and 
prepare young talent for a 
true title push in 2018.

Harbaugh could trot out 

McCaffrey or Peters and let 
them take their lumps. But in 
all likelihood, a young team 
led by a young quarterback 

would stumble 
to a record that 
isn’t indicative 
of the talent 
the Wolverines 
have.

Or Harbaugh 

could start 
O’Korn. 
The fifth-
year senior 
would take 
snaps under 
center for a 

year before his eligibility is 
exhausted, all in the name 
of stopping the bleeding — if 
he’s even capable of doing so. 

McCaffrey and Peters still 
wouldn’t get the experience 
that seems so appealing to 
many as they look to the 
future.

Then there is Speight. He 

has a year of experience. 
He has a year of eligibility 
left. The Wolverines get 
a quarterback capable of 
leading a roster ample with 
youth, and develop Peters 
and McCaffrey for a year — 
all while Speight continues 
to develop himself.

If, come next year, 

Speight isn’t best suited 
to lead Michigan, then the 
torch still gets passed to 
his successor. And if he is 
Harbaugh’s choice — which 
would speak volumes, as 
it already should — the 
Wolverines have a two-year 
starter leading a crop of 
receivers brimming with 
potential.

In Speight, Michigan 

has a man praised for his 
ability to lead a team when 
faced with adversity — the 
Wolverines being booed 
for the first time in the 
Harbaugh era against 
Cincinnati serving as the 
most recent example.

“Everyone sees it, but 

it doesn’t faze him, so it’s 
not gonna faze us,” Kugler 
said, when asked if the 
team recognizes the 
criticism Speight 
has received. “So 
as long he keeps it 
cool — and I know 
he will — because 
he’s a great leader, 
he’s poised, 
no matter the 
circumstance. He’s 
our quarterback. 
He’s our leader, 
so I’ll follow 
him.”

Added 

fullback 
Khalid 
Hill: 
“Next play, 
that’s just 
his mindset. 
It’s always been his 
mindset, ever since 
he became a starter. I 
appreciate him having 
the mindset of a true 
leader. He leads by 
example and he 
wants everyone 
to do the best 
that they can. I 
applaud him for 
that.”

Last year, 

Speight didn’t 
need to be a 
leader. Enough 
seniors around 
him could 
assume that 
role.

And yet, 

Kugler 
explained, 
Speight led 
anyway. He 
isn’t a “rah-
rah” guy, 
but he is a 
steadying 
force. That 
should be 
more than 
enough on a 
young team 
that will 
be prone 
to making 
mistakes — 
even if Speight 
is making them 
himself.

Redshirt junior quarterback Wilton Speight has faced a large share of criticism lately, but that doesn’t change the fact that his coach and his teammates still believe he is the starter for the Wolverines.

KEVIN 
SANTO

The redshirt junior has made uncharacteristic mistakes to open the 
season, but the starting job belongs to him, and it should remain his

“He wants 

everyone to do 
the best that 
they can.”

“I appreciate 
him having the 

mindset of a 
true leader.”

Freshman receiver Tarik Black has earned a starting spot early in his career.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will give Amazon a closer look at his program. 

Black off to impressive 
start to his career at ‘M’

Tarik Black’s first two games 

for Michigan have been nothing 
short of exceptional. 

A freshman receiver from 

Connecticut — not Texas, Florida 
or any other football hotbed 
— is starting for the seventh-
ranked team in the country. He’s 
starting over his classmate, the 
former No. 1 wide receiver in 
the nation, and producing well 
beyond his years.

In two career games, Black 

has caught six passes for 94 
receiving yards, and he even 
scored a touchdown on his first 
career reception.

“Coming 
in, 
(making 

an 
impact) 
was 
definitely 

something I wanted to do,” Black 
said to media Tuesday. “I knew I 
had to work my tail off and learn 
that playbook, but I knew things 
would happen for me.”

Enrolling early last winter, he 

had time to learn the playbook. 
Black’s 
impact 

on 
the 
field 

is 
already 

apparent, 
but 

he admits that 
he 
struggled 

adjusting to the 
college game.

At 
first, 

Black 
found 

that 
getting 

accustomed 
to 

a new playbook 
and new routes was not so easy.

“I struggled a little bit with 

the playbook,” Black said. “That 
was the hardest part. Once I got 
that down I was able to do what I 
came here to do.”

The 
nuances 
of 
actually 

getting open hadn’t been part 
of Black’s game in high school. 
Both in speed and in his overall 
skillset, he was a step ahead of 
all of his opponents, so beating 
out a safety or cornerback for 
a catch was never a problem. 
Though, with defensive backs 
around college football — as 
he’ll soon learn in the Big Ten 
season — it’s not as easy to break 
free.

In high school, Black did not 

have to worry about whether 
to sit in a zone or take the open 

space, and reading defenses had 
never been a concern. He was a 
four-star recruit and the No. 1 
overall player in Connecticut — 
getting open back then was not 
an issue.

At Michigan, though, there 

has been a lot more to learn.

“We just run a lot of routes 

here,” Black said. “The more you 
do it, you’re going to continue to 
get better at it. The amount of 
routes you run is the reason why 
you get better at route running.”

Having gone through spring 

practice, fall camp and now two 
games, Black is fairly confident 
that he has already proven 
himself. However, he says that 
he still has a lot to work on, 
especially in being more physical 
in order to beat out cornerbacks 
off the line of scrimmage.

“At this level, you actually 

have to work to release,” Black 
said. “You’re not just going 
to run off the ball and run by 
everybody like I used to do in 
high school. That’s something I 

had to add to my 
game in order to 
get open.”

Physical play 

will come with 
time 
as 
Black 

continues 
to 

grow 
stronger. 

But his mental 
game is where he 
feels he has been 
able to make the 
most strides.

Black watches game film with 

redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight. He has already 
built a strong relationship with 
his new quarterback, and going 
over film together has helped 
him solidify that bond.

“(Speight) definitely teaches 

me a lot,” Black said. “I’ve 
learned a lot from him about 
college football. It’s definitely 
different than what I’m used to.”

When Black was “used to” 

high school football, he was 
lighting 
up 
backfields 
and 

earning his chance to play in the 
U.S. Army All-American game.

With 
almost 
a 
hundred 

receiving yards and a touchdown 
already, if he’s not “used to” the 
college game yet, Michigan fans 
have plenty to look forward to.

Michigan, Amazon team 
up to create docu-series

Starting in January, Wolverine 

fans will get an inside look at the 
2017 season, as the Michigan 
football 
program 
announced 

a partnership with Amazon 
Prime on Tuesday — geared 
toward creating an eight-episode 
documentary series about how 
Team 138 operates during the 
season. 

The 
documentary 
will 
be 

released 
on 
Amazon 
Prime 

following the end of the season, and 
is part of a partnership between 
Michigan, Amazon, The Montag 
Group and Big Ten Network.

The show will document the 

lives of the Michigan players, 
coaches and staff during the 
season — both at home and on the 
road — and also follow the student-
athletes into the classroom.

“We are proud to partner 

with Amazon Prime Video in 
documenting our University of 
Michigan student-athletes’ daily 
experiences 
and 
the 
lifelong 

lessons learned both on the 
football field and in the classroom,” 
said Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh in the press release. “We 
welcome judgement! We embrace 
this opportunity to showcase 
our 2017 University of Michigan 
football team to a vast audience 
around the world.”

The series will likely bear 

resemblance to documentaries 
like Last Chance U and Hard 
Knocks that give a behind-
the-scenes peek at college and 
professional 
football 
teams. 

Last Chance U, a docu-series on 
Netflix, follows the lives of various 
college athletes that have had off-
the-field issues. Those athletes 
wound up at East Mississippi 
Community College, where they 
were given another shot at playing 
football.

The Netflix show is popular 

among the Michigan football 
team.

Sophomore 
safety 
Josh 

Metellus watches Last Chance U 
with some of his teammates, and 
at one point he thought to himself 
that making a documentary would 
be a good thing for someone to 
do about their own football team 
here in Michigan.

His wish came true, and now 

he’s got a show of his own. The 
cameras have been following him 

and the other Wolverines around 
campus — to practice, team 
meetings, classes and anywhere 
else. Constantly having a camera 
crew on his tail could seem 
distracting, but Metellus noted 
that it’s nothing he isn’t used to.

“We got people following us 

around every day whether or not 
there’s cameras,” Metellus said.

The camera crew also only 

comes three days a week, and 
Metellus described it as “nothing 
too serious.”

With a year under his belt, 

Metellus has gotten used to the 
media attention. The freshmen 
on the team, though, are the ones 
relishing the newfound fame.

“You can just tell by all the 

videos we have that (freshmen) 
post from the Michigan twitter 
page,” Metellus said. “They love 
the camera — mostly the offensive 
players. They just love being the 
flashy type of guys. You know, 
on defense, we don’t really get all 
that recognition, because we play 
defense. The offense likes to take 
it.”

So far, the cameras have been 

following around “the guys who 
get the ball,” according to fifth-
year senior Henry Poggi.

That includes most of the 

players you would usually hear 
about — guys like redshirt junior 
quarterback Wilton Speight and 
freshman wide receiver Tarik 
Black.

For Poggi, not so much.
“I’d be surprised if they 

featured me,” Poggi joked.

Poggi, a self-proclaimed fan 

of MTV’s Real World, admitted 
that 
the 
Michigan 
football 

documentary 
would 
not 
be 

including any major confessions 
like the hit reality show used to.

“Much to the viewers’ dismay,” 

he laughed.

Nonetheless, he and others felt 

that the series could be helpful 
to the program by giving fans an 
inside look at the inner-workings 
of the Michigan football team.

It will certainly pay dividends 

on the recruiting front, but 
sophomore offensive lineman Ben 
Bredeson had his own personal 
reasons for liking the show.

“It’s going to help answer a lot 

of questions from Mom and Dad 
who always want to know what’s 
going on every day,” Bredeson said 
with a grin. “I’ll just tell them to 
watch, and we’ll be good.”

Wednesday, September 13, 2017 // The Statement 

Personal Statement: Four Months at the Helm 
of the News Desk

F

or four months of my life, I served as 
boss, editor, reporter, writer and tyrant 
all at once: This summer I worked as the 
managing news editor of The Michigan 

Daily.

It was a position I was surprised to hold for a 

number of reasons — the first being I didn’t see 
myself pursuing journalism after school.

That’s not to say I don’t enjoy journalism or my 

time at the Daily. From it, I’ve become a more 
competent writer, I’ve made friends and I learned 
more about current events and social issues than 
had I simply been sitting in a classroom all summer. 
I absolutely love the organized chaos that composes 
a newsroom, and having been part of a few different 
publications in college and high school, I have met 
some of the most intelligent individuals. Though I 
have nothing but respect for the field, I still didn’t 
see myself as a journalist.

I pictured myself, and still do to an extent, as a 

lawyer or working in academia. Some think I’m 
crazy for considering a Ph.D. program in sociology, 
as these can take more than seven years to complete, 
and if I decide to pursue law school immediately 
after completing my undergrad, I should be well 
on my way to studying for the LSAT right now … 
which I’m not.

My dad is a lawyer who teaches a course in 

business law, so I’ve always imagined myself, like 
him, teaching something that interests me. I enjoy 
school, as much as I complain about the workload, 
and I see myself continuing in an academic setting. 
And in my mind, pursuing journalism as a career 
doesn’t fit that mold — especially a managing editor. 
 

I never envisioned myself as a boss. I suppose 

I imagined myself in a sort of background role 
— no less important, just not at the front. I feel I 
contribute thoroughly to group assignments. I’m 
a good listener, and I partake in discussions. I’ve 
always felt comfortable as an asset to a team I’m not 
responsible for. I like the idea of proving myself — 
not in a self-deprecating way, but in an aspirational 
way — to those above me. It’s a feeling comparable 
to my interest in academia.

Therefore, I didn’t see myself assuming a 

managerial role.

I was used to being told what stories to write 

by higher powers, to attend a protest at which 

the Graduate Employees’ Organization would 
be rallying in support of a new contract with the 
University, to abruptly call state Rep. Adam Zemke 
to obtain a last-minute quote for an article on the 
night that it is due, to cover a Central Student 

Government meeting with 20 minutes’ notice, 
semi-quiet place on campus — likely in a stairwell 
somewhere — to conduct a phone interview.

However, planning to stay in Ann Arbor for the 

summer, I wanted a challenge. I disregarded my 
concerns because I wanted to try something new 
— and I cannot deny, I have a soft spot for The 
Michigan Daily.

Upon embarking on the role, I was quickly 

humbled, stressed and, frankly, tired.

It was a learning experience to say the least 

because I was unsure of how exactly I would 
perform: Would I be aggressive, too easygoing or 
plainly ineffective?

I feared that I wouldn’t know how to assign 

stories evenly; I feared I wouldn’t know where to 
place stories on a page for print publication; I was 
terrified I would overlook an important event in 
Ann Arbor or on campus — and what would I do if I 
couldn’t manage my time well enough?

On my first night in charge, three stories came 

in, rather late, from three competent, but very new, 
reporters. I don’t think I’ve ever sent as many text 

messages as I did on that day to the writers, other 
news editors, the editor-in-chief, copy editors and 
photographers. It was a late night.

I wish I could say it was all uphill from there, 

but it wasn’t. There were many late nights, several 
instances of confusion over article deadlines (Yes, 
it’s still 5 p.m.), story angles, communicating with 
sources and questions about editing.

And there were hundreds — maybe thousands — 

more text messages.

In my time as managing news editor, I asked as 

many questions as I answered. I communicated 
with hundreds of people — reporters, fellow 
editors, protesters, professors, students, state 
representatives and even my own father, who 
kindly explained to me the difference between tax 
evasion and tax avoidance. I sent out hundreds of 
emails, to the point where I wouldn’t be upset if I 
never had to write an email again, and I wrote well 
over 50 articles and contributed to dozens more.

Since the summer staff at The Michigan Daily 

only meets once a week in the newsroom to 
create a print paper, a large part of my job was 
done remotely. As my inbox became flooded with 
emails I realized my experience would be as much 
a learning experience as the academia I hoped to 
continue pursuing.

Journalism is raw and fast-paced, but it is still 

just as multifaceted as any field of study. It’s like 
academia in real-time, if that makes sense.

I learned early on that the staffwould not function 

without group chats — several group chats, in fact 
— to keep editors and photographers on the same 
page as stories went through the editing process.

I learned Ann Arbor City Council meetings 

are a lot easier for me to understand than CSG 
meetings, and that it’s a bad idea to conduct an 
interview while walking in the Arb.

I learned the newsroom at the Daily on a hot 

July night is kept at an icy 55 degrees and so it is 
important to dress in layers.

And above all, I discovered the collaborative 

efforts that I merely wished to be a member of 
were very much alive as I served at the top.

Perhaps, it’s these little things that keep me in 

the newsroom past 1:00 in the morning debating 
the minor details of a tuition hikes with my 
editor.

ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN TOLAR


“

Love you and miss you 
loads! Can’t wait to 
hear more adventures 
next week! XOXO...”

When was the last time you 

sent someone a letter? I don’t 
mean birthday cards or thank 
you notes. When was the last 
time you sent a loved one a 
handwritten letter and kept a 
correspondence going through 
snail mail?

I would imagine only a few 

people 
still 
communicate 

through this outdated medium, 
but 
letter-writing 
remains 

a timeless mechanism that 
can bridge an emotional and 
physical gap between two 
people.

Letter-writing has played 

a 
particularly 
important 

role in the resurgence of my 
relationship with my older 
sister, Adina. Other than the 
occasional argument that most 
siblings have at one point or 
another, we didn’t have a lot of 
issues growing up. Our strong 
bond as brother and sister was 
rooted in listening to mashups 
of 
pop 
songs, 
watching 

“America’s Next Top Model” 
and making each other laugh, 
often to annoy and vex our 
parents.

After she left for college, 

however, our conversations 
became sporadic, and I began 
to see the limitations of our 
communication 
and 
our 

closeness. I would only get to 
see her during school breaks 
or religious holidays. It was in 
her absence that I realized how 
little I knew about what was 
going on in her life.

Being the younger sibling, I 

didn’t think to ask about whom 
she was dating or her thoughts 
on current events. Selfishly, I 
figured that it wasn’t my place 
to inquire about such ideas. As a 
result of this apprehension, we 
began to drift apart. 

What I value most in my 

relationship with my sister — 
other than the sweet childhood 
memories we share and our 
similar tastes in music and 

TV — is the necessity for 
transparent 
communication. 

More specifically, the necessity 
for our exchanges to be more 
than just the generic “Hey, 
how are you?” The necessity of 
openly discussing heavy, hot-
button issues and our current 
pop culture obsessions. I was 
looking to evolve our older-
younger sibling dynamic into 
something akin to a mature 
close 
friend-colleague-type 

relationship.

During my first two years 

of college, my sister and I hit 
a rough patch. We weren’t 
talking or texting each other 
much. Often, I wouldn’t get 
a response to a text I sent her 
until two days 
after. When we 
did talk, it was 
always 
at 
an 

inconvenient 
time 
and 

typically 
the 

same one-sided 
conversation: I’d 
tell her at length 
about my life at 
the moment and 
she’d only tell 
me vague details 
about hers. Our 
lives 
couldn’t 

have been more 
different — me, 
being a college 
student 
and 

her, working as a high school 
special education teacher in 
Seattle. Given the weight of 
daily stresses straining our 
routines, 
our 
conversations 

became inert.

What bothered me wasn’t 

just that our communication 
lacked depth and dynamism, 
but that somehow our closeness 
as 
siblings 
was 
gradually 

dissolving because of lack of 
communication. We both knew 
it, yet neither of us wanted to 
admit it or confront it because 
it would open up all kinds of 
uncomfortable wounds that 
had been deeply suppressed 
from years of reticence.

On a family vacation in Palm 

Springs last winter, the rut 
deepened into an all-time low. 
Our conversations quickly went 
from tepid to passive aggressive 
to hostile. Tension stirred 
between us during long bouts of 
simmering angry silence on the 
drive there and back. Staying in 
the same hotel room for a few 
nights didn’t help either. We 
were acting as if we weren’t 
even siblings anymore, just two 
disgruntled young adults who 
happened to be related to each 
other.

After 
we 
apologized 

and reconciled, things got 
somewhat better. We both 
recognized each other’s needs: 
She wanted me to ask more 

mindful questions and I wanted 
her to give me more thorough 
answers. 
Still, 
something 

was missing, especially when 
our discourse returned to its 
normal, lackluster state.

During this past spring 

semester, I attended the New 
England Literature Program, 
a six-week academic retreat in 
the woods of New Hampshire, 
where 
technology 
was 

nonexistent and the only means 
of 
outside 
communication 

was via letter-writing. Along 
with the other elements of the 
program, I found the tech-
free environment particularly 
exciting and liberating. Not 
only would I get the chance 

to experience life without my 
phone or computer, but also I 
would learn to connect with 
my friends and family outside 
NELP 
through 
physical, 

handwritten letters — the “old-
fashioned” way.

When I wrote my first letter 

to Adina, in addition to the 
rest of my family, I instantly 
noticed a change in the way 
I communicated. My inner 
thoughts flowed more fluidly 
from my fingertips. I paid closer 
attention to the kinds of words I 
used to describe my experience 
away from home, integrating 
daily anecdotes with pensive, 
personal reflection. I felt like a 
better version of myself writing 

these letters. And 
when I received my 
first reply from Adina 
in the mail, I grew 
giddy. 
She 
wrote 

a long, thoughtful 
response back, asking 
me questions about 
the experiences that 
I shared with her and 
divulging her own 
vivid stories about 
her early summer 
days.

I loved the letters 

she sent me, because 
I, 
too, 
believed 

Adina was the best 
version 
of 
herself 

in her letters. I felt 

her dynamic spirit in the way 
she emphasized her emotions 
through capitalized words and 
multiple exclamation points. 
I sensed her compassionate 
attention to detail in the way 
she asked me about the classes 
I was taking on New England 
authors, weekly camping trips 
and other various activities. 
But perhaps most importantly, 
I learned so much more about 
her from how thorough she was 
in recounting her day-to-day 
happenings. Her letters made 
me feel a lot less lonely and 
alienated in our siblingship, and 
I’d like to believe she harbors a 
similar feeling.

In one of Adina’s last letters 

to me at NELP, she proposed 
that we keep writing letters to 
each other after the program 
was over. At first, I was a 
little unsure — why keep 
corresponding through letters 
when we could just text, call 
or 
FaceTime? 
It 
sounded 

redundant, but I figured I’d give 
it try, since I enjoyed writing to 
her anyway and wanted to see 
if it would further develop our 
revitalized closeness.

Post-NELP, we continued 

writing 
letters, 
giving 

descriptive 
accounts 
about 

what we were both up to since 
our last correspondence. Soon, 
we texted more frequently and 
direct-messaged funny memes 
to each other. I stopped getting 
mad at her when she wouldn’t 
respond to my texts, because 
there was more than just one 
line of communication. Now, our 
day to day felt riper and livelier. 
Through Twitter and texting, 
we talked about our pop culture 
icons (some of our favorites are 
Issa Rae, RuPaul and Fiona 
the Hippo), exchanged ideas 
for tweets and discussed our 
thoughts on relationships and 
current events.

As slow and time-consuming 

as writing letters may be, 
they have the power to open 
up a whole new channel in 
an 
emotionally 
dormant 

relationship. Even if technology 
offers 
a 
faster 
route 
for 

communication, 
there 
is 

something so authentic, so 
cathartic and so gratifying about 
handwriting a letter to someone, 
awaiting their response and 
then reading their reply over 
and over again. Sure, the process 
requires some extra patience, 
effort 
and 
commitment. 

Conflicting schedules might 
lengthen the waiting period. 
But letter writing shouldn’t feel 
like a chore. Rather, think of it 
as a regular conversation, one in 
which you and another person 
can make up for lost time.

“I can hear your voice 

through your words. I’ll write 
back as soon as I can.”

Lessons in Silence

Navigating our digital world

b y R e b e c c a Ta r n o p o l, Editorial Page Editor
S

ome dreary November day my 

junior year of high school, I 

plugged away at a calculus test. 

As I calculated how quickly the 

height of water was changing in a tank drain-

ing at some fixed rate, I felt it emanating from 

my right pocket. Buzz. I knew exactly what it 

was: a group chat of my friends who attended 

another high school, texting over their lunch 

hour. This wasn’t an uncommon occurrence — 

my phone often blew up during this class, text 

after text, notification after notification.

But this time its incessant buzzing was cer-

tainly audible in the silent test room. When 

I turned in the test, a mixture of embarrass-

ment and indignation prompted me to set my 

phone on silent. It has remained on silent ever 

since.

***

I got my first smartphone — an iPhone 

5S — in 2013. I was 16 years old. Even then, 

I entered the smartphone world late. In 2012, 

the average age children got their first smart-

phone was 12. By 2016, this age lowered to 10.

Nonetheless, I now stand among the major-

ity of American adults who own smartphones. 

According to a 2016 Pew Research Center 

survey, 77 percent of U.S. adults own smart-

phones, compared to 43 percent in September 

2012. This skyrocketing trend suggests these 

numbers will only increase, especially as 

younger generations enter adulthood: 99 per-

cent of 18- to 29-year-olds in the U.S. owned 

smartphones as of 2016.

The ubiquity of smartphones and social 

media usage — particularly among young peo-

ple — has prompted criticism from research-

ers and writers alike. But the statistics show 

smartphones are here to stay, at least until 

the next thing comes to replace them. Perhaps 

instead of lamenting the damage, we should 

examine how exactly smartphones change 

our interactions with the world around us.

***

When I left for the New England Literature 

Program this spring, the concept of living 

without electronics was not novel to me. From 

the age of ten, I was lucky enough to attend 

overnight summer camps with strict “no cell-

phone” policies. I regard these summers as 

formative to the person I am today, largely 

due to the community created in an environ-

ment free of digital distractions.

It was this community-driven environment 

that initially attracted me to NELP, a Univer-

sity of Michigan program in which students 

spend six weeks in rural New Hampshire 

reading the works of New England authors, 

writing voraciously in journals and explor-

ing the New England landscape — all without 

technology.

But NELP marked the first time in four 

years I had been device-less (staff at my sum-

mer camp had the “privilege” of bringing 

their phones to use on off hours), and perhaps 

the first time in my academic career I had an 

entirely analog educational experience (bar-

ring the Play-Doh and spaghetti paint half-

days of preschool).

In the days leading up to NELP, I worried 

about the severance from my primary mecha-

nism of communication. What will my friends 

be talking about without me? What if someone 

important emails me about an opportunity I’d 

regret to miss? What memes would crop up 

while I was gone?

Don’t get me wrong: Even in my phone’s 

silence, it commands my attention. My edit-

ing job at the Daily often demands I attend to 

texts and emails quickly, and course sites like 

Canvas allow instructors to update assign-

ments at any hour of the day, beckoning an 

obsessive student like myself to check in as 

often as possible.

Yet I’d be lying if I said I only obsessively 

checked my phone for business. I often receive 

compliments for my Facebook presence, and 

any of my friends can tell you I respond to texts 

and Snapchats at a record pace — for the most 

part (sorry, Mom). My arrival at NELP killed 

many long-standing Snapstreaks, the longest 

of which lasted 397 days before I turned in my 

phone for the spring (sorry, Jess).

The initial unease of turning in my phone at 

the beginning of NELP wasn’t enough to make 

me realize my dependency on it. Within hours 

I had forgotten about my phone, and I never 

once wished I had it. It wasn’t until weeks into 

the program, when I subconsciously reached 

for my phone in my pocket, feeling for its 

weight as if it were some ghost limb, that it 

hit me how ingrained in my life my phone had 

become.

***

“When I meet new people and they hear 

about my job, often their first question is 

something like: ‘Whoa, how do you deal with 

taking phones away from your students? That 

must be really hard,’” Aric Knuth, director 

of NELP, said. “But the fact is, it’s not hard. 

I think today people … are excited to see 

what life looks like and feels like without the 

phone.”

Sun poured into Aric’s office the September 

morning I visited him. He attended NELP as 

a student in 1997, years before smartphones 

made their debut, and has taught at the pro-

gram ever since. Even those not familiar with 

him can gather that NELP is core to his identi-

ty. His office door is plastered with remnants 

of NELPs past: flyers for mass meetings and 

reunions, notes from former students, a litho-

graph of Henry David Thoreau. Now, he sits 

in front of me, bespectacled and eager to talk.

“Things don’t feel that different to me, 

which is a strange thing to say because the 

world has changed so much,” Aric said. “But 

the fact is, in 1997 and ’98 and ’99 — when I 

was at NELP before phones — NELP was 

phoneless. And now, NELP is still phoneless.”

He attributes NELP’s unchanged atmo-

sphere to the fact that once students turn in 

their phones, they don’t lament their absence. 

Rather, it seems they merely forget about 

them, clicking into the lifestyle the program 

facilitates without much trouble. The story 

seems to turn after students receive their 

phones at the end of the program.

“Before smartphones, it was not uncom-

mon for a NELP student to get their cellphone 

back and smash it with a rock. I saw that a 

few times,” Aric said. “But if you’re smashing 

your iPhone with a rock, you’re losing a lot of 

money,” he added, contemplating the implica-

tions of society’s current investment in tech-

nology.

“When I say ‘invest,’ I mean that word in 

all the ways you might mean that word. It’s a 

financial investment, but your life is invested 

in it in all these ways too.”

***

“Investment” is a rather apt way to describe 

the relationship between humans and smart-

phones. Global revenue from smartphones 

sales reached $435.1 billion in 2016. Despite 

the iPhone X’s sticker price of $999, sales are 

still projected to break records. 

Where there is an investment in money, 

there also is an investment in time. Look 

around any room, and you’re likely to see blue 

light illuminating someone’s face. On campus, 

I see students text and Snapchat as they wait 

for class to start, particularly in large lecture 

courses. People text away during class, during 

passing times, during meals. I rarely take an 

elevator ride where at least one person isn’t 

avoiding conversation by scrolling through 

Facebook or Instagram on their phone. I 

myself am guilty of using my phone in all of 

these situations.

Research corroborates the large time 

investment I observed. In a 2017 ReportLinker 

survey, 46 percent of respondents reported 

checking their phone first thing when they 

wake up in the morning and 53 percent reported 

checking their phone before going to bed. Peo-

ple continue to check their phones constantly 

throughout the day. A 2015 Gallup poll report-

ed more than half of U.S. smartphone owners 

check their phones at least once an hour, with 11 

percent of respondents reporting checking their 

phones every few minutes. This amounts to U.S. 

consumers using their phones for an average of 

five hours over the course of a day.

Another 2015 Gallup poll revealed nearly half 

of U.S. smartphone owners could not imagine 

their lives without smartphones, a phenomenon 

they call “smartphone amnesia.” In practice, 

smartphone amnesia is likely more common, as 

a smartphone’s convenience often hides itself 

subtly in our daily lives. Last week in my medi-

eval travel literature course, my professor posed 

the question: “What do you use when you trav-

el?” The immediate answers were dominated by 

digital tools: smartphones, Google Maps, apps 

like GroupOn and Uber.

I couldn’t help but think about how just 

four months before my friends and I had been 

dropped off at a random location in rural New 

Hampshire, given a map and a compass and 

were told to get back to camp by dinner time. 

How foreign this analog way of travel had 

become.

***

Back in Aric’s office, he professed his fasci-

nation with the ways technology interacts with 

our daily lives.

“I do think often about how these technolo-

gies totally shape our vision of the world, in 

ways that isn’t (sic) always cool,” Aric contin-

ued. “The social media stuff, the Facebook algo-

rithm that determines what you see. … The fact 

that there’s just a thousand people in the world, 

and my sense of the community I’m a part of is 

really shaped by this algorithm.”

Facebook’s algorithms have grown notorious 

for their ability to tailor content specifically to 

each of its users’ tastes. These algorithms have 

proven to be incredibly powerful at shaping 

our perceptions. In 2012, Facebook conducted 

a behavioral experiment wherein algorithms 

curated people’s newsfeeds to selectively 

include either uplifting or upsetting content, 

and researchers found users’ moods shifted 

accordingly.

As he wrapped up a story about an incon-

sistency in Apple Maps that left him lost in the 

woods a few weeks earlier, Aric provided a note 

of caution. “There’s that danger of relying so 

much on the technology and the way it repre-

sents and can misrepresent the world.”

***

Misrepresentation is certainly a problem on 

social media, whose platforms host content that 

is highly curated both by the people posting it 

and by the algorithms calculating what exactly 

each user wants to see.

Considering the amount of time people 

spend on social media, this misrepresentation 

becomes especially problematic. A 2016 Nielsen 

report revealed that U.S. adults ages 18 to 34 

spend an average of six hours and 19 minutes on 

social media per week; U.S. adults ages 35 to 49 

spend even more — six hours and 58 minutes per 

week. This means that U.S. adults spend signifi-

cant amounts of time pouring over the carefully 

curated highlight reels of other people’s lives.

It’s no surprise, then, that research has 

revealed overwhelmingly negative correlations 

between social media usage and mental well-

being. A 2013 study conducted by psychology 

researchers at the University found that Face-

book usage correlated with a decline in “subjec-

tive well-being” of young adults. Studies have 

also cited Instagram as a particularly odious 

platform for mental well-being.

These effects are particularly troubling for 

a demographic Jean Twenge, professor of psy-

chology at San Diego State University, coined 

as the “iGen.” She defines the “iGen” as people 

born between 1995 and 2012, whose childhoods 

were dominated by the internet and rise of 

smartphones. By these standards, most Univer-

sity undergraduates are members of the “iGen.”

Twenge found higher rates of loneliness, 

sleep deprivation, depression and suicide among 

“iGen” teens in the years since smartphones 

became household items. Twenge fears these 

ailments will devastate a generation, as these 

problems will likely linger into adulthood.

***

Week five, day six of NELP, I sat on a dock 

with my friend Kelly, watching the still waters 

of Lake Winnipesaukee. With the end of the pro-

gram growing palpably near, we griped about 

how our phones would soon bombard us with 

information. I dreaded sifting through the hun-

dreds of texts and emails that would populate 

my phone as it woke from its six-week slumber.

I remember feeling this incredible sadness 

that NELP inevitably had to end, and I’d have 

to return to this sea of endless information. 

My time at NELP had left me content — if not 

happy — for the longest duration than I had 

been perhaps since my last phoneless days at 

camp in 2013. I woke up excited to see what each 

day would bring. I did not need worry about 

some exam, some meeting, some post-gradu-

ate opportunity lingering in the distant future 

often made urgent by the constant pestering of 

a smartphone.

But to attribute the happiness I felt at NELP 

solely to my separation from technology would 

be inaccurate. There were other factors, too: the 

rigorous yet supportive academic environment, 

the regular hiking trips through the New England 

wilderness, the opportunity to witness the bloom-

ing of spring for the second time in a year, the two 

dogs who laid patiently on the porch daily.

If anything, NELP offered a sense of clarity I 

hadn’t experienced in a long time. All that mattered 

in the world for those six weeks was right in front 

of me. I could sit on the dock staring out onto Win-

nipesaukee, basking in the present, asking myself, 

to borrow words from Kurt Vonnegut: “how wide it 

was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.”

***

At NELP, we weren’t at all strangers to the ideas 

of technological detractors. Hell, I even took a class 

about the Unabomber, who was certainly no advo-

cate for technological advancement. Before even 

leaving for NELP, we were instructed to read the 

“Economy” chapter of “Walden.” There, among his 

criticisms of American capitalist culture, Thoreau 

also denounces advents in communication tech-

nologies.

“We are in great haste to construct a magnetic 

telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and 

Texas, it may be, have nothing important to com-

municate,” Thoreau writes. “We are eager to tunnel 

under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some 

weeks nearer to the New; but perchance the first 

news that will leak through into the broad, flapping 

American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has 

the whooping cough.”

In essence, Thoreau detests the construction of 

the telegraph because it creates noise that dimin-

ishes whatever utility the shiny new technology 

might have had to begin with. Still, the novelty of 

the invention draws people to it, despite its useless-

ness.

150 years later, Thoreau’s words still hold truth 

— perhaps more so now than ever before. Social 

media has granted us the opportunity to commu-

nicate (instantly) from Maine to Tehran, Iran, and 

Princess Adelaide’s affliction has been supplanted 

by clickbait imploring you to discover whatever 

shocking ensemble Kylie Jenner wore to dinner the 

other night.

There’s a sort of self-consciousness that sur-

rounds social media usage. I’m keen to believe 

many of us know we shouldn’t care about our 

middle school classmate’s trip to the Bahamas or 

what Kylie Jenner wore to dinner that night. But 

thousands of years of human social evolution didn’t 

hardwire us to resist our urges to return yet again 

to these platforms which radically change the 

way humans interact with each other. The iPhone 

itself is only 10 years old, and apps just nine. These 

are our modern day magnetic telegraphs, and we 

haven’t yet figured out how to filter out the noise.

***

When I returned to “real world” Ann Arbor 

for the summer, I found myself frustrated at how 

quickly I fell back into my old habits, spending 

empty hours leafing aimlessly through Facebook, 

Instagram and Twitter. I had gone six weeks with-

out social media and didn’t miss anything impor-

tant at all — why was it that I now felt as if I’d be 

missing out on something if I wasn’t always check-

ing my phone?

It took me a while to realize NELP was a fan-

tasy land: We were isolated unto ourselves, all 53 

of us operating on the same rigid daily schedule. If 

I wanted to hang out with someone, I only had to 

walk 500 feet to find them. And we were still able to 

get access to memes if we wanted them — we’d just 

have to wait for them to arrive in the mail.

The world as we know it doesn’t operate so neat-

ly. We live in large societies, populated by people 

living incredibly different lives on incredibly differ-

ent schedules. If I were to walk to a friend’s house 

unannounced, I’d be lucky if they actually hap-

pened to be there. As much as I didn’t like it, I came 

to realize my phone offered the most efficient way 

of controlling the entropy of everyday life, to coor-

dinate my life with those around me.

It was just that my next task had to be finding 

balance.

***

Where I find fault in much of the current dis-

course about smartphones and social media usage 

is its failure to treat what it means to be a human 

navigating a world that grows increasingly digital 

with adequate sensitivity. Too often smartphones 

are written off as entirely detrimental to our exis-

tence, when the inventions themselves are not 

inherently evil.

For example, in an op-ed for the New York 

Times, Cal Newport, associate professor of com-

puter science at Georgetown University, claims that 

using social media ravages our ability to do impor-

tant work. Surely, he argues, if we channeled the 

same energy into our work as we do into perfect-

ing our LinkedIn profiles or crafting our Instagram 

aesthetic, perhaps we would actually accomplish 

something of worth.

But claiming that social media is of no value to 

important work is just as egregious as claiming that 

it is harmless. I, for one, hope to become a research 

scientist and I think some of the most important 

work scientists do is share their research on social 

media. As is, the bulk of scientific knowledge is 

inaccessible to the general public, either from the 

thick jargon that litters scientific discourse or the 

steep subscription fees for scientific journals.

In our current cultural moment, the general 

public is much more apt to believe political pander-

ing than actual scientific data, an issue particularly 

relevant to climate change. For scientists to forgo 

the opportunity to reach millions of people on a 

platform they use by choice — for free, might I add 

— is irresponsible and possibly even destructive to 

scientific careers. After all, much basic research is 

funded by the general public’s tax dollars.

Beyond the professional world, social media 

has also served as a springboard for social change. 

Social media has given historically subjugated voic-

es a platform to come to the forefront of conversa-

tions and organize massive movements. (Though 

these platforms remain admittedly imperfect on 

these fronts.) Black Lives Matter, perhaps one of the 

largest social movements in recent history, started 

as a hashtag on Twitter. January’s Women’s March 

grew from a Facebook event into an international 

affair.

At the end of the day, smartphones and social 

media have made our worlds infinitely larger, and, 

by extension, have offered us more resources and 

opportunities than we have time to take up. Sure, 

there are completely inconsequential opportuni-

ties we often engage in — adding that stranger on 

LinkedIn or picking the right Instagram filter 

for that photo of your brunch. But if we use 

these technologies in a measured and mindful 

way, we can do some truly amazing work.

***

Here I am now, back in the noisy world of 

Canvas announcements, Daily emails and push 

notifications. It’s been a strange return to the 

traditional classroom, where the roundtables 

and notebooks that characterized my NELP 

education have been replaced by rows of desks 

and laptops. Other things have come more 

naturally: My Snapstreaks are slowly regaining 

traction, the longest of which now clocking in 

at a measly 79 days.

I have taken steps, though, to limit my phone 

usage, to try to re-establish that clarity I felt 

at NELP. I keep my phone tucked away in my 

backpack during class. I ride my bike around 

campus to keep from texting as I commute. 

I leave my phone to charge on my desk over-

night, far from arm’s reach. Of course, I keep 

my phone in the same state it has been in since 

2013: silent.

Wednesday, September 13, 2017 // The Statement
6B
Let’s Talk About It: Do you speak English?

E

nglish is the language my 
tongue commands with 
the most power and versa-

tility, yet it is the one from which I 
feel the most estranged — or almost 
unwelcome. I perform spoken-word 
poetry in English, I write articles 
for The Michigan Daily and I plan to 
teach English in secondary schools. 
Despite that English is my first and 
most fluent language I know others 
will not fully accept me as a native 
English speaker because when they 
see my hijab, or Muslim headscarf, 
they question whether I speak it 
before any words leave my mouth.

The notion that I do not speak 

English is even more peculiar when 
considering English is my primary 
language. To some, my knowledge 
of English only serves as evidence 
that the British colonized the coun-
tries of my parents and ancestors. In 
one of my classes last fall, I brought 
up 
that 
European 
accents 
are 

thought of as superior, despite their 
difference from American accents, 
while other non-European accents 
like the South Asian accent are 
often mocked. I talked about how, 
although my parents learned Eng-
lish at school in their home coun-
tries, their miniscule South Asian 
accents — or perceived accents — 
can still be mocked as comedic. My 
professor then returned my com-
ment with a question that made me 
stumble: “Isn’t the fact that they 
learned English in their schools 
eurocentrism?” I was taken aback 
as I realized the language I hold 
such strong command over, that was 
taught to my parents and grandpar-
ents, was only a language learned because 
of European colonization.

This made me think of how English 

came to be the primary language spoken 
in my home — because of my eldest broth-
er’s kindergarten teacher. She called my 
parents one day deeply concerned that he 
was speaking to her in Urdu — my par-
ents’ native language — instead of Eng-
lish. My parents decided it would best if 
they stopped teaching us Urdu altogether, 
a flawed solution that came as a result 
of my teacher’s idea that bilingualism is 

problematic. 

In my School of Education courses, I 

learned this episode was hardly unique 
to my family. Many children that were 
originally bilingual are discouraged from 
speaking their home language. This cre-
ates a conflict of demands that is impossi-
ble to satisfy. Even when in public, people 
have questioned my and my family’s Eng-
lish. How is it that people can want others 
to know English, and yet, even when they 
do, it is never considered “good enough?” 
How is it that I can speak, read and write 

in English just as well as the average Eng-
lish speaker, and yet my English ability is 
still questioned?

Growing up, not being fluent in Urdu 

was frustrating for me. In the mosque I 
grew up in, Urdu is a big part of the cul-
ture and adults and friends often mocked 
me, asking me how much I understood.

“Do you know what ‘cow’ is in Urdu?” 

“Do you understand what I am saying?” 
“You don’t know Urdu, right?”

I was treated as inferior by many of my 

friends because Urdu was such a central 

part of their lives. It was only 
because of my childhood friend 
and her parents that I know as 
much Urdu as I do now, and they 
were the only ones who did not 
judge me for how much I knew. 
I spent many of my summers 
listening to them speak to one 
another or to me in Urdu, and 
sometimes responded when I felt 
brave enough. Consequently, I 
know enough to get by and even 
help some of my friends by trans-
lating for them when sermons are 
in Urdu at my mosque, but the 
obstacles that I face with Urdu 
still frustrate me.

At first glance, not many peo-

ple know how far my interest in 
language stretches. I’ve spent 
much of my life studying Arabic 
and recently used this knowledge 
when traveling abroad. I am cur-
rently learning Farsi and slowly 
building up my Urdu with prac-
tice. I find myself trying to hide 
the amount I know, and often do 
not respond to people in Urdu 
when they speak to me.

It was only when I asked my 

mother that I fully understood 
what my feelings on this are. Her 
response was, as always, about 
the importance of good values. “I 
think it was more important that 
we taught you how to be good 
people, and so I don’t think it 
really makes a difference wheth-
er we taught you Urdu or not.” 
Her response made me think 
about all the good that I did learn 
from my parents.

Language is not about supe-

riority, and knowing one better than 
another does not make a person better or 
worse, or more or less intelligent. I have 
been viewed as inferior because of my 
experiences being an English speaker who 
wears a hijab and being a South Asian that 
does not speak her mother tongue fluently. 
Yet, it was the more important lessons that 
were taught in my house — values of treat-
ing others with kindness regardless of their 
background, as well as other religious val-
ues — that formed a culture in my home 
stronger than my South Asian culture.

The Picture Stays in the Kid: Days Off

T

he last time someone asked me 
where I was from, the response 
itself was long enough to be 
nominated for a writing award (it 

certainly wouldn’t win, if anything for lack of 
lucidity).

“I’m from the North Shore suburbs of Chi-

cago, about 30 minutes on the 94, sort of near 
Northwestern University in Evanston, in John 
Hughes territory: You know, like “The Break-
fast Club” and ‘Ferris Bueller.’”

In fact, I’ll continue, if I haven’t lost the cap-

tive attention of my audience, “Ferris Buel-
ler’s Day Off” and “The Breakfast Club” were 
filmed at my high school in Northbrook, Ill., 
and were based on them. It’s a fun little fact that 
sometimes surprises and leads to an additional 
inquiry or two on the subject, but never lingers 
beyond ephemeral interest.

It was the same for me for the longest time, 

until it wasn’t. I threw out the fact as a matter of 
location-sleuthing convenience, and occasion-
ally as an icebreaker, but, as most would think 
with a fun fact, my high school’s cinematic 
legacy wasn’t much of my identity — despite the 
seemingly unending obsession with it that sur-
rounded me growing up.

It changed once my passion for film bloomed. 

I wanted to see myself — the halls I walked, the 
classes I took — on screen. And “Ferris Bueller” 
was it.

Film-going audiences have watched North 

Shore Chicago life unfold on screen for years. 

1980’s “Ordinary People” traced the lives of a 
grieving family in Lake Forest. “Mean Girls” 
ostensibly was set at Evanston Township High 
School, but any North Shore resident will tell 
you with a wink and perhaps a hushed voice 
that it’s actually about New Trier Township, 
Evanston’s wealthier neighbors to the north 
and the cluster of towns to the east of North-
brook.

And all John Hughes’s films — “The Break-

fast Club,” “Sixteen Candles,” “Home Alone,” 

and, of course, “Ferris Bueller” — were set in 
the North Shore, and some specifically in the 
fictional (but not entirely) town of Shermer 
(Northbrook was called “Shermerville” before 
anti-German sentiment in World War I led the 
town to name itself after the branch of the Chi-
cago River that runs through the town).

But there’s something about “Ferris Bueller” 

specifically that so perfectly captures a sub-
urban Chicago malaise and boredom, and the 
yearning to escape it.

My family drove down to Chicago nearly 

every week when I grew up, almost always to 
visit my grandmother who lived at the corner 
of Michigan and Chicago avenues. It was prime 
real estate — the famous water tower that sur-
vived that 1871 Chicago Fire sat across the 
street. Her window faced the towering John 
Hancock Center and a sliver of the Oak Street 
Beach peeked through the buildings clawing 
into the sky, north on the Magnificent Mile. I 
could spend hours staring at that view.

Every week, as I sat in Sunday school classes 

at synagogue, I couldn’t wait to climb into the 
car, stop at home briefly to grab some waters 
and a sweatshirt (“It’s colder by the lake,” my 
mom reminded us), and head down on I-94. 
The suburban tree-and-house-scapes that 
lined the highway would soon give way to the 
more crowded buildings lining busy streets. We 
would pass an old church whose ornate exterior 
came just short of the highway. We would pass 
a building side with an impressive and ever-

changing wall mural. We would pass the Mor-
ton Salt rooftop, which featured its logo — the 
umbrella girl — with the saying, “When it rains 
it pours.”

The same could be said for the city itself. In 

Chicago, even on the touristy and relatively 
staid Michigan Avenue, life was lived. Even 
more so in the peripheral neighborhoods where 
I began spending more time in recent years: 
Lincoln Park and Lakeview, the West Loop, 
Hyde Park. “Ferris Bueller,” I knew, was full of 
delirious exhilaration, but it was a metaphor for 
a state of being — of simply being in the city.

Ferris dances around to The Beatles’s “Twist 

and Shout” in a German pride parade. Every 
moment in the city seems like a celebration, 
every street corner a meticulously planned 
work of art. He steals the identity of the fiction-
al Abe Froman, the supposed “sausage king” 
of the city. Chicago, literally “the second city,” 
with a massive chip on its shoulder, is I believe 

the nation’s best-kept secret, even if 8 million or 
so people live in its environs and millions more 
tourists flood the city every year.

When my parents moved to Chicago from 

Washington, D.C., they settled in the city 
proper, moving around from neighborhood to 
neighborhood until deciding to move into the 
suburbs after deciding against a house in Chi-
cago’s Wicker Park, then on the cusp of a rapid 
bout of gentrification.

I understand their decision — and I value liv-

ing in a quiet village on the edge of Cook Coun-
ty — yet I can’t help but mourn the exuberant 
urban life I could have had. As if my birth itself 
were a scar in replace of an alternate life, I was 
born in Evanston while both my brothers and 
my father were all born in the same hospital in 
downtown Chicago.

I suppose I’m not alone, not even in my 

immediate family. My dad’s ancestors lived on 
the southside of Chicago since the 1870s, and 
his mother moved the family to Glencoe, Ill., 
only one town east of where I grew up. He, too, 
traveled to the city frequently to see his grand-
parents and the extended family in Hyde Park. 
And yet, at the end of the day, he lived in subur-
bia, close in proximity, but much farther in cul-
ture, from the city a half an hour to the south.

When I first watched “Ferris Bueller’s Day 

Off,” I was with my dad, who smiled and said, 
“This is a perfect movie.”

I think he knew it too.

Last Saturday, I photographed the Michigan football game against 
Cincinnati. I left my apartment at 9:30 a.m. and did not get home 
until 5:30 p.m. In between, I found myself on the field of the Big 

House, dodging footballs as they flew off the field and snapping over 

1000 photos. 

The team huddles on the field before returning to the locker for the last time before the game.

Photographers use the same tunnel entrance to the field as the players. Fellow Daily photographer Sam 
Mousigian and I walk out 45 minutes before game to ensure we don’t get trampled.

The sidelines often get crowded with TV crews, photographers, cheerleaders and the players vying for 
space.

A view of the student section from the field.
The sideline is packed with photographers and everyone must stay off of the field.

After the game, senior quarterback Wilton Speight shakes hands with a Cincinnati player.
Everyone follows the team back into the tunnel. The team goes into the locker room, and everyone else 
goes into the media rooms.
