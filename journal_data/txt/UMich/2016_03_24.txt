Federal officials 

urge universities to 
increase accessibility 

in higher ed

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

In 
a 
call 
with 
reporters 

Wednesday 
afternoon, 
U.S. 

Secretary of Education John B. 
King Jr. and Roberto Rodriguez, 
deputy assistant to the president 
for 
education, 
stressed 
the 

importance of colleges playing 
a role in increasing access to 
higher education.

“A college degree is the surest 

path to the middle class for many 
students, especially for students 
from low-income families,” King 
said. “But there are far too many 
barriers preventing low-income 
students from enrolling and 
graduating from college.”

King said higher education 

institutions have a responsibility 
to 
expand 
opportunity 
and 

target support to lower-income 
students, particularly Federal 

Pell Grant recipients. Federal 
Pell 
Grants 
are 
need-based 

grants for students given in a 
maximum 
amount 
of 
$5,815 

yearly.

“These 
institutions 
must 

ensure the degrees students 
receive prepare them for the 21st 
century economy and success 
after college,” he said.

Currently, 
King 
said 
only 

10 percent of schools in the 
country are enrolling their fair 
share of Pell recipients and also 
graduating more than half of 
them on time. He said the United 
States must do better.

While noting that department 

officials realize the rising cost 
of college makes it hard or 
impossible for some students to 
attend college, King said under 
the Obama Administration the 
maximum Pell Grant amount 
has increased and will now be 
indexed to inflation. Pell Grant 
recipients now encompass 40 
percent of all college students.

King also touched on Obama’s 

2015 pitch to make community 
college free as a key to making 
higher education accessible for

Astrophysicist 

urges audience to 
explore the sciences

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Neil 
deGrasse 
Tyson, 
an 

award-winning 
astrophysicist, 

author and television host, visited 
Ann Arbor Wednesday night for 

a stop at Hill Auditorium as part 
of his “An Evening with Neil 
deGrasse Tyson” tour. The tour 
began in January in Los Angeles 
and ends Thursday in Detroit.

The 
theme 
of 
Tyson’s 

Wednesday 
night 
talk 
was 

“cosmic 
perspective,” 
which 

Tyson defined as a view bigger 
than 
an 
individual’s 
own 

perspective that offers a humbling 
but enlightening outlook of one’s 
place in time and space.

In his lecture, Tyson stressed 

that because humans are made 
of the most abundant elements 
— such as hydrogen, carbon and 
oxygen — they are not different 
or separated from the rest of the 
universe.

“We are literally stardust — if 

that doesn’t make you feel large, 
I don’t know what will,” Tyson 
said. “We are not only in the 
universe, but the universe is in 
us.”

Tyson also addressed the 

importance of investing in science, 
technological, engineering and 
math research, as well as being 
comfortable seeing math and 
science in popular culture. He 
even suggested featuring STEM 
researchers on currency, as is 
done in Germany.

“(It’s) a culture that is not 

afraid to display the (STEM) 
brilliance of their citizens,” Tyson

Spray repellant 
could impact 

auto, refrigeration 

industry 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

The hassle of scraping ice off 

your car windshield in below-
freezing 
temperatures 
and 

snowy weather might soon be a 
thing of the past.

University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers recently developed 
ice-repellent 
coatings 
that 

have the ability to make ice 
slide off materials such as 
car windshields, ships and 
airplanes. Made from rubber, 
the spray-on technology could 
have a major impact on multiple 
industries affected by ice and 
cold climates.

The product was developed 

by Kevin Golovin, a doctoral 
student in materials science and 
engineering, and Anish Tuteja, 

associate prof. of materials 
science 
and 
engineering. 

The 
ice-repellent 
coating 

technology is being funded 
through several federal offices 
and departments including the 
Office of Naval Research and 
the Air Force Office of Scientific 
Research. 
The 
Michigan 

Translational 
Research 
and 

Commercialization, a program 
that provides resources to the 
College of Engineering and the 
University’s 
Transportation 

Research 
Institute, 
is 
also 

sponsoring the project.

“Living in Michigan, we see 

the issue of ice everywhere, so 
the need for a surface like this 
was quite obvious,” Tuteja said.

The new spray-on coating 

works 
through 
chemical 

alterations 
and 
blending 

of 
rubbers, 
Golovin 
said, 

ultimately creating a product 
that has never been made or 
prototyped before.

objects stuck together, they

With five choices 
remaining, student 
support varies after 
Michigan primary

By LYDIA MURRAY 
and CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporters

The presidential race began 

with 23 candidates. Now, only 
five remain — two Democrats and 

three Republicans. On campus, 
students appear to lean toward 
Sanders, but that is certainly not 
the only view present.

The Michigan primary was 

just one example of how student 
voters have significantly impacted 
the election cycle. Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (D–Vt.) scored a surprise 
win over Hillary Clinton with 50.1 
percent of the vote, despite having 
a 20-point deficit in the polls 
leading up to the election. High 
voter turnout and support among 
young people — particularly 

students — in part drove Sanders 
to victory in the state.

On the Republican side, Donald 

Trump’s victory was expected 
by pollsters. Gov. John Kasich’s 
(R–Ohio) had hoped to achieve 
a second place finish to bolster 
his position moving forward. 
Though Cruz came in second, 
Kasich found particularly strong 
support in the areas surrounding 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

earning 34 percent of the overall 
Republican vote in Washtenaw 

Ann Arbor Twp. 
pursues superfund 

designation for 
dioxane plume

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor Charter Township 

is exploring the possibility of 
petitioning 
the 
Environmental 

Protection Agency to designate a 
local dioxane plume contaminating 
groundwater beneath the township 
as a superfund site.

Doing so would grant the EPA, 

rather than the state, authority 
to clean the toxic matter, a move 
that’s desirable for many township 
leaders due to their lack of 
confidence in the state’s ability to 
resolve the problem. However, Ann 
Arbor officials say they are unsure 
if they will support a move by the 
township to do so.

more students, a sentiment 
Rodriguez echoed.

“The 
president 
firmly 

believes that anyone who works 
hard should not be priced out 
of a college opportunity and 
college education, particularly 
with the demands of today’s 
economy,” Rodriguez said.

He said the administration 

has also made progress by 
working 
to 
keep 
interest 

payments low and cap student 
loan payments at 10 percent of 
their income.

As well, by putting the 

Free Application of Federal 
Student Aid online and making 
it both easier to complete 
and available three months 
earlier, Rodriguez said the 
administration is trying to 

give 
hard-working 
students 

as much time as possible to 
search for the college that’s 
right for them and receive the 
aid they need.

“We will continue to work 

with more communities to 
strengthen education access, 
affordability and success for 
their students,” he said.

Ted Mitchell, U.S. under 

secretary of education, also 
joined the call, mentioning 

how federal aid can only do 
so much, and states need to 
reinvest in higher education to 
keep the cost of college tuition 
down.

“It’s important to recognize 

the 
major 
driver 
of 
the 

increase in costs and the 
increase in tuition prices is 
a result of widespread state 
disinvestment 
in 
higher 

education 
since 
the 
Great 

Recession,” Mitchell said.

Group strives to 

provide better care 
to underdeveloped 
areas of country

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

The Medical School and the 

School of Business have teamed 
up with the goal of increasing 
access 
to 
health 
care 
and 

education in Sri Lanka.

For the project, the two 

schools are partnering with the 
Grace Care Center, a shelter 
for orphan girls and the elderly 
located 
in 
Trincomalee, 
Sri 

Lanka. The shelter provides 
food, housing and schooling for 
dozens of girls and destitute 
elderly individuals, many of 
whom fled war or were impacted 
by a 2004 tsunami.

Business 
graduate 
student 

Patrick 
Camalo 
and 
Erica 

Dancik, a Business and Public 
Health 
graduate 
student, 

became involved in the GCC 
project 
through 
a 
Business 

School MBA class this semester 
called International Business 
Immersion: Healthcare Delivery 
in Emerging Markets. Twenty-
five students from the class are 
participating in five projects 
around the world.

Camalo said the Sri Lanka 

project will also include students 
from the Ford School of Public 
Policy and the School of Public 
Health.

“We focused on looking for a 

financial model for diabetes and 
hypertension in a remote area of 
Sri Lanka, in Trincomalee,” he 
said. “We wanted to understand 
the current landscape of diabetes 
care and then understand what 
a financially viable way was 
to deliver improved care to a 
broader patient population.”

Dancik said she and the 

team spent time meeting with 
Dr. Naresh Gunaratnam, the 

shelter’s founder, before crafting 
the program.

“We 
then 
traveled 
to 

Trincomalee for one week so 
that we could see, first-hand, 
what 
the 
health 
landscape 

looks like and so that we could 
interview and interact with 
some of the project’s key players 
and stakeholders,” she said.

Gunaratnam, 
a 

gastroenterologist 
at 
the 

University of Michigan Medical 
Center who was born in Sri 
Lanka, founded the GCC in 
2002. He fled the country with 
his family after the country 
became embattled in civil war in 
the 1980s.

“My father was a physician, 

and 
he 
loved 
teaching 
at 

the hospital in the capital,” 
Gunaratnam said. “He took his 
family out of the country that 
he loved because he thought it 
would give my brother and I a 
brighter future.”

Gunaratnam’s 
father, 

who 
passed 
away 
when 

Gunarantam was a teenager, 
served as an inspiration for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 

orphanage and elder care 
center in Trincomalee.

“When I had established 

myself as a physician and 
had the opportunity to help 
children like myself who had 
lost a parent, I jumped at the 
chance,” 
Gunaratnam 
said. 

“I empathized with their loss 
and knew the impact a few 
caring souls could have on 
their lives.”

The primary goal of the 

Business 
School’s 
project 

team is to eventually bring a 
long-term health care system 
to Trincomalee through two 
phases, the first focused on 
telemedicine and the second on 
self-sufficiency and expansion. 
Telemedicine is when doctors 
use Skype or other technology to 
provide care from afar.

As part of the collaboration, 

Anjan Saha, a medical scientist 
training program fellow at the 
University, traveled to GCC 
last December to help facilitate 
a camp that provided blood 
pressure 
and 
blood 
glucose 

tests to patients. Saha said 
the telemedicine aspect of the 
program has been very successful 
in providing information to the 
doctors in Sri Lanka.

“Reception for all of our 

projects has been good and we 
have continued to be invited 
back,” Saha said.

Currently, GCC — which also 

aims to safeguard the health and 
safety of the local population 
— is focusing their new health 
care initiative on hypertension 
and diabetes treatment and 
prevention. The blood tests Saha 
assisted with in December were 
free of charge to patients and 
funded by the Global Reach fund 
of the UM Medical School.

A total of 35 patients received 

testing, 
demonstrating 
the 

potential for the effectiveness 
of the health care delivery 
program, Saha said.

While the camp was deemed 

successful, Camalo said there 
is more work to be done. 
Affordability of care and building 
trust and interest among the 

Trincomalee residents are key 
goals 
Camalo 
and 
Dancik’s 

team are considering. Though 
primary health care in Sri Lanka 
is free, there is a lack of doctors 
and efficiency is a problem, 
which leads to long waits and 
often discourages locals from 
visiting clinics.

“It is a very inefficient system, 

so there is an emerging private 
sector market where people have 
to pay for care,” Camalo said. 
“However, people do not have a 
lot of money to pay for that, so it 
is usually targeting the wealthy 
population.”

Camalo said the team is 

exploring a few ideas for creating 
a sustainable financing source 
for the blood-testing program. 
He said one potential method 
could be a monthly subscription 
plan to encourage visits or a 
cross-subsidized program that 
would 
take 
payments 
from 

those who were more capable 
of affording the care to support 
the payments for lower income 
individuals.

“We are trying to incentivize 

different behaviors from the 
patients,” Camalo said. “If they 
come more frequently, we will 
give them a discount. People 
tend to come in only when their 
diabetes is out of control due to 
lack of education.”

Outside of the partnership, 

students 
on 
campus 
are 

providing other forms of aid 
to GCC. Student organization 
GracedU was founded in 2015 
by LSA sophomore Sahr Yazdani 
and LSA junior Rasika Patil to 
provide educational resources 

and support to girls at the GCC 
through 
video 
tutoring 
and 

other forms of outreach.

Yazdani has been working 

for GCC for five years and 
worked with the medical school 
to develop “Elder Care Night,” 
during 
which 
GCC 
medical 

assistants considered ways to 
improve the health care of senior 
citizens. Yazdani said her visit 
to the shelter in the summer 
of 2015 was a life-changing 
experience. She made the trip 
through VeAhavta, the non-
profit organization based in Ann 
Arbor that helps run Grace Care 
Center.

“From the moment I stepped 

off the bus, the little girls clung 
to my hands and legs, proudly 
showing off their home and 
their family,” Yazdani said. “The 
girls from Grace taught me the 
power of resilience — many of 
them have been through the 
toughest of life’s situations, 
but never once did they reflect 
negatively on their experiences. 
They demonstrate what it means 
to have courage in the face of 
adversity.”

Patil said she created the club 

after being inspired by the girls 
of GCC.

“I recognized a motivation 

within myself and my colleagues 
to help foster the Grace girls’ 
enthusiasm 
for 
learning,” 

Patil said. “Their dedication 
to the pursuit of knowledge is 
incredibly inspiring, and, in turn, 
we are dedicated to providing 
them with the peer support and 
educational resources they need 
to develop that passion.”

LSA sophomore Lindsay Randolph, president of Students for Kasich, discusses her thoughts on the 2016 presidential election on the Diag Monday.

you make one of those objects soft 
like rubber, then when you try to 
push off the hard object, it makes 
the rubber deform,” Golovin said. 
“That deformation creates a stress 
concentrator between the hard 
object, which in this case is the 
ice, and the rubber. That actually 
causes it to detach with a lot lower 
force than you would normally 
need.”

This 
phenomenon, 
called 

interfacial 
cavitation, 
is 
what 

explains the science behind this 
technology.

Though putting additives such 

as oils or silicone into the rubber 
makes it more slippery and helps to 
ease off ice, Golovin said the main 
goal of their project is to make 
the rubber softer by changing its 
properties.

“The reason rubber is hard or 

soft is something known as how 
many chemical crosslinks are in 
the rubber,” Golovin said. “That’s 
sort of a covalent bond inside and 
… the more there are, the harder 
the rubber is. You can tune the 

chemistry to make it softer just 
by lowering how many crosslinks 
there are.”

The spray-on coating could 

prove to be important for multiple 
industries, Golovin said, including 
those that produce airplanes, 
boats, 
food 
packaging 
and 

refrigerator linings. He added it 
may be difficult to put the product 
into use on airplanes because there 
are such stringent requirements 
for equipment used in aircrafts, but 
it would be possible for the product 
to be commercialized for boats that 
go through shipping lanes in the 
Arctic, as well as for food-based 
products.

“For 
different 
applications, 

we 
might 
have 
different 

requirements,” Tuteja said. “For 
example, if I was working with 
a food application with making 
packaging for frozen foods, then 
we can only work with materials 
that are approved by the FDA. 
That’s a limited number of rubbers 
that are approved.”

Golovin said there are multiple 

advantages to the spray-on coating, 
including 
its 
versatility 
and 

durability.

“One of the main motivations 

for this work was to make 
(coatings) that you wouldn’t need 
to constantly repaint on, so they 
effectively last as long as you 
need them to last,” Golovin said. 
“There’s no reason they should 
degrade over time.”

The coating itself, researchers 

also noted, is not just a single 
formula; formulas were developed 
to 
accommodate 
multiple 

materials.

“What we’ve done here is 

made well over 100 different 
coatings, and they’re all made of 
different rubbers and different 
oils, all different chemistries 
and compositions,” Tuteja said. 
“The reason was really to show 
that we understood these two 
new mechanisms that can show 
how ice detaches from rubbers 
and by being able to work with a 
wide range of different materials, 
we showed the principles that 
are applicable for a number of 
different materials.”

Researchers noted that one 

potential 
challenge 
for 
the 

coating is whether it will still 
work under extremely harsh and 
cold conditions. Golovin said 
rubbers have a property called 

glass transition temperature, at 
which the rubber becomes too 
cold and begins to act more like a 
glass than a rubber.

“How 
the 
coating 
works, 

you need the rubber to still be 
soft, so for certain rubbers, the 
temperature at which they stop 
being soft is the temperature at 
which they would stop working,” 
Golovin said. “Much like how 
you can choose the material to 
work with whatever underlying 
substrate, you can also choose 
rubber that have different glass 
transition temperatures so that 
you can make sure it still works 
at whatever temperature you’re 
expecting to see.”

Tuteja said the goal is to 

commercialize the coating in 
partnership 
with 
companies 

in 
multiple 
disciplines 
and 

industries, as well as create a 
spray that can be sold for use 
directly in households. He was 
co-founded a startup company, 
which is now licensing the 
technology and partnering with 
different companies for use in 
different fields. The technology is 
expected to be put into use within 
a year.

plume of the toxin 1,4-dioxane 
underneath Washtenaw County. 
The plume has contaminated 
groundwater and is expected by 
local officials to reach the Huron 
River in the coming decades.

Though 
the 
Michigan 

Department 
of 
Environmental 

Quality has maintained a network 
of monitoring wells to track the 
plume since 1992, city leaders have 
long been critical of the state’s 
response, and the Flint water crisis 
has re-energized public scrutiny 
on this issue.

In a February meeting of county 

leaders, Ann Arbor Township 
Supervisor Michael Moran told 
Michigan DEQ representatives 
he had “lost his confidence” in 
the state’s ability to control the 
contamination. Moran also said 
his township was exploring the 
option of turning the plume into a 
superfund site.

Monday night, the Board of 

Trustees for Ann Arbor Charter 
Township — which is a separate 
municipality from the city of Ann 
Arbor — unanimously authorized 
Moran to petition the EPA for 
superfund status.

In 
an 
interview, 
Moran 

said 
Michigan’s 
regulatory 

environment 
has 
failed 
to 

meaningfully 
manage 
the 

contaminated water, and the 
state’s recent promises to increase 
funding 
on 
monitoring 
and 

introduce more stringent cleanup 
standards for 1,4-dioxane are 
insufficient.

“Michigan statutes are not 

aimed at getting a cleanup of 
pollution, but rather managing 
the risk of pollution, and those are 
wildly different concepts,” Moran 
said, adding the EPA doesn’t 
operate under these constraints.

However, other local leaders 

say they are still unsure if the 
township’s 
decision 
was 
the 

best choice. Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor (D) said in 
an interview with the Daily that 
while the EPA would likely lead 
a more comprehensive cleanup 
of the contaminated water, the 

stigma of superfund status could 
damage property values in the city.

“The EPA is obviously very 

well-respected and tremendously 
valuable; however, the declaration 
of a superfund site has other 
consequences,” Taylor said. “If a 
portion of Ann Arbor is declared 
a superfund site, one expects 
that will reduce property values, 
even though the toxicity is of 
no immediate concerns to the 
immediately proximate residents.”

Taylor 
did 
not 
completely 

rule out supporting the petition 
and said the city will need to 
study the issue further before 
making a decision. He added the 
city’s current plan is to work the 
Michigan DEQ and Michigan 
Attorney General’s office to push 
the original polluter to perform a 
more comprehensive cleanup. In 
interviews, City Councilmembers 
Chip Smith (D–Ward 5) and 
Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 4) 
echoed Taylor’s points.

Moran said he does not intend 

to move forward with a superfund 
petition without consensus from 
the city of Ann Arbor and the 
rest of Washtenaw County. He 
noted a consultant working for 
a consortium of county officials 
had reported superfund status 
would not significantly hurt local 
property values, based on previous 
studies.

“It’s 
an 
issue 
that 
needs 

consideration 
from 
all 
local 

governments,” Moran said.

However, he also noted the 

township could still move forward 
without the approval of all the 
county’s municipalities.

Moran said the Michigan DEQ 

has failed, and other options to 
control the pollution need to be 
explored.

“After 20 years, the pollution 

plume is getting bigger and 
bigger, and there’s an inadequate 
response,” Moran said. “How long 
are you willing to keep playing 
with the same people?”

When reached for comment 

on 
Tuesday, 
Robert 
Wagner, 

Michigan 
DEQ 
remediation 

chief, said he respects Ann Arbor 
Charter Township’s decisions and 
is willing to work with the EPA if 
necessary.

County.

In a series of interviews with 

The Michigan Daily, students 
shared their political views, why 
they support different candidates 
and what they hope for the future 
following the election. Quotes 
were chosen from each interview 
to reflect the students’ beliefs.

Brendan Schroder

LSA junior, supports Sanders. 
“My father left when my mother 

was pregnant with me, so I had 
a single mother growing up,” he 
said. “It was very interesting to 
see from her point of view also as 
a teacher who hasn’t made that 
much. When you go through the 
education system a lot of teachers 
are very liberal, so that came 
across through my mother, but she 
also taught me to be loving and 
compassionate.”

“Surprisingly, 
I 
was 
very 

religious 
between 
sixth 
and 

12th grade. That actually is what 
formed me to what I am today. 
What all of the pastors taught me 
is that you should love one another; 
you should help one another. 
Right now those same people are 
voting for Ted Cruz and Donald 
Trump, so I don’t know where the 
disconnect happened that I ended 
up leaning towards Bernie Sanders 
and they ended up leaning towards 
that, but I feel like the messages 
they taught me, I interpreted as to 
believe in Bernie’s policies where 
we have to help people.”

“The 
college 
campus 
has 

changed a lot for me. Coming 
out of high school, I was kind of 
uneducated on a lot of issues. Being 
around a diverse group of people 
has helped me understand people 
better and probably made me more 
liberal leaning.”

Madeline Jursek

School of Information senior, 

supports Kasich.

Chair of the University chapter 

of the College Republicans

“My parents are both very 

strong, right-wing conservatives, 
and that obviously has a very 
strong say in what I believe now,” 
she said. “I have changed a lot 
since I came to college. Before I 
came to college, I was really just 
aligned with my parents’ views, 
but when I came here I definitely 
became more moderate. A big part 

of that was in high school I was 
part of a very small community, 
but coming here I got to meet all 
of these wonderful people and that 
changed my viewpoints a lot.”

“For me it’s mainly the fiscal 

issues. Social issues for me are 
not as important. I’m really a fan 
of how he turned around Ohio in 
terms of the big budget surplus 
and doing tax cuts. I also like the 
fact he is a little bit more moderate 
on the social issues.”

“I like the fact that his temper is 

pretty mild. I think as a president 
you need to be kind of calm at all 
times and level headed, so I like 
that Kasich seems to be very not 
quiet, but easy going with an even 
heeled temper.”

Anushka Sarkar

LSA 
sophomore, 
supports 

Hillary Clinton

Outreach director and event 

coordinator 
for 
Students 
for 

Hillary

“The trait that really draws me 

to Clinton is that she is a fighter,” 
she said. “There is a lot of sexism 
in the media, there is a lot of 
criticisms of Clinton even though 
she’s done some truly incredible 
things for people. Day in and day 
out she comes back and continues 
to fight for the people who criticize 
her — that’s the kind of selflessness 
that I would like in a leader — 
someone who has insults hurled 
at them in a rally and still goes out 
to fight for legislation that defends 
those people.”

“There are three policies that 

I am most passionate about: 
mental health, sexual assault on 
college campuses and college 
affordability. The sexual assault on 
college campuses is particularly 
important to me because Hillary 
is the only presidential candidate 
to have a platform about this. It’s 
an issue that, as a female college 
student, I’m afraid of every single 
day. It’s very validating to know 
that the person I support for 
president cares about my safety on 
campus.”

“People 
tend 
to 
view 
a 

woman who is commanding or 
authoritative or assertive in any 
way as bossy. If you have a man 
who speaks commandingly or has 
years of experience, that person 
wouldn’t be seen as a liar or 
someone who is untrustworthy, 
they would be seen as a commander 
in chief. Another reason people see 
her as a liar is that she has evolved 

on issues, which is something 
every candidate has done, and 
is necessary. You can’t hold onto 
your views from the ‘70s to 2016 
because while your views are 
important, what is most important 
is that you represent the people 
who elected you or who support 
you.”

Molly Grant

LSA 
sophomore, 
supports 

Trump.

Member 
of 
the 
College 

Republicans

 “His tax and immigration 

policy are most appealing to me,” 
she said. “When you think of 
Trump, you do not think of taxes. 
I’ve been encouraging people to 
look at his tax policy. It’s a four 
bracket system — the highest is 
25 percent on income. That is 
something I really like about him 
and I encourage others to look 
at it. Also, I really support him in 
immigration. We aren’t a country 
if we don’t have borders. I’m very 
pro-immigration, but it has to be 
legal. With him, I am confident 
that he will do something about 
immigration.”

“No matter what side you are 

on, the youth enthusiasm for 
voting in this election is crazy. 
Trump and Sanders are drawing 
huge crowds of college voters 
in, and that’s awesome. In terms 
of being at Michigan, I’m a very 
proud Trump supporter. I know I 
am in the really small minority, but 
I have found that with the Sanders 
supporters I have had great 
discussions with some of them. 
Talking about policies, not getting 
into arguments, but seeing where 
each other stands on these issues 
and gathering an understanding of 
why the other person thinks that 
way.”

“Do I agree with everything 

Trump says? No. But I think 
people are quick to judge on what 
they hear without sitting down 
and looking at his policies — things 
that aren’t brought up in the news 
such as his tax policy.”

Erin Kokoszka

LSA 
sophomore, 
supports 

Sanders. Member of Students for 
Sanders.

“I first heard about him last 

summer, maybe a couple of 
months before he entered the 
race,” she said. “I didn’t get that 
much of a realistic impression of 
him. I had heard of him as this 
outsider, socialist Democrat who 

didn’t really have a chance but had 
some really cool ideas. But then in 
the fall I joined up with Students 
for Sanders.”

“I think he is a really genuine 

candidate. He doesn’t have any 
super PACs. He doesn’t take any 
money 
from 
corporations 
or 

wealthy individual donors. You 
can tell who’s funding him, and in 
that sense he is more credible. He 
does seem very trustworthy. He’s 
consistent; he has a record. You 
can look up what he’s been doing 
and the values that he’s held for the 
past few decades.”

“I’d like to see a revitalizing 

our democracy. That’s what his 
campaign is really about, just 
taking the people’s voice and 
letting it be heard again. Having 
people actually represented in 
Washington by people who will 
actually protect their interests.”

Lindsay Randolph

LSA 
sophomore, 
supports 

Kasich

President of Students for Kasich
“He’s such a nice guy,” she said. 

“You look at Ted Cruz or Donald 
Trump. There are people getting 
beat up at his rallies. Whereas with 
Kasich — at least at the town halls 
I’ve been to — people are crying, 
he’s hugging them. It’s just a 
complete opposite of what you are 
seeing from the other Republican 
candidates. He shows compassion 
and genuine interest in the well-
being of Americans.”

“I would like to see a presidency 

that brings Americans together. 
At the end of the day, we can work 
together for a common purpose 
and not be so divided. Kasich 
speaks a lot about knowing your 
neighbor and having a community, 
and I think once we unite and work 
together to solve our problems 
and focus on our neighbors and 
our community then America can 
begin to thrive.”

“I grew up in a somewhat 

working-class 
home. 
College 

is where I started becoming 
interested in politics. I became 
much more informed and more 
interested in social issues. You 
can practically solve issues that 
the Republicans are not focused 
on, and I think you get that with 
Kasich. He wants to focus on the 
environment, he wants to not be so 
divided on gay rights.”

The Daily was unable to contact 

any supporters for Sen. Ted Cruz 
(R–Texas) on campus.

said.

Tyson said integrating the 

sciences into popular culture 
will help citizens become more 
scientifically literate, noting that 
the United States has both a low 
global ranking for math literacy 
in standardized assessments and 
a low percentage of people who 
believe in evolution. 

In particular, Tyson is known 

for using Twitter to share his 
passion for science to a broader 
audience. During an interview 
prior to his lecture on Wednesday 
with the Fox affiliate in Grand 
Rapids, Tyson said he uses social 
media to help people understand 
the sciences.

“I offer people a way to see the 

world that maybe they have never 
been taught,” Tyson said in the 
interview. “You don’t have to be 
fluent in math or fluent in physics, 
but you should at least be open to 
what’s going on around you.”

Tyson ended his talk with a 

quote from “Pale Blue Dot,” a 
book written by Carl Sagan, a late 

astronomy professor at Cornell 
University. The quote emphasizes 
how small and alone Earth is 
in the universe and how “there 
is no hint that help will come 
from elsewhere to save us from 
ourselves.”

LSA senior Trevor Picard said 

the quote was the perfect way to 
end the talk.

“That quote is my favorite,” 

Picard said. “(I) definitely liked 
the part where seeing the pale blue 
dot underscores our responsibility 
to deal kindly with one another.”

Samantha 
Musil, 
an 

event 
adviser 
with 
Campus 

Involvement, said Tyson almost 
did not speak at the University 
of Michigan, as his promoter 
originally considered just doing 
two shows in Detroit.

“(Tyson’s promoter) thought it 

was possible to do two shows in 
Detroit because the market was 
big enough to support multiple 
events,” Musil said. “We were able 
to find a date for them for a show 
in Ann Arbor that coincided with 
a date in Detroit, which doesn’t 
always happen. So we’re very glad 
and fortunate that we were able to 
host Dr. Tyson in Ann Arbor.”

ELECTIONS

C

entral Student Government elections 
are currently underway. Save for the 
spammy Facebook messages you’re 

likely receiving from your 
friends — or “friends,” 
broadly 
construed 
— 

asking you to vote for 
them, you may not have 
paid much attention to the 
elections at all. Students 
on this campus certainly 
don’t face a shortage of 
challenges — but many of 
them don’t necessarily see 
CSG as the body destined 
to solve them.

That needs to change.
Over the past two years, I’ve had the 

opportunity to work with and get to know 
David Schafer and Thomas Hislop, two of 
the candidates for CSG president. Last fall, 
Schafer and I served together on the College 
Republicans Executive Board. Hislop and I 
are both in the Ford School of Public Policy, 
and have taken three classes together. 
I’ve seen firsthand how both candidates 
approach problems, develop solutions and 
implementation strategies. Both candidates 
are great people, and I have no doubt that 
they would both engage with their work as 
president at a high level.

That 
said, 
I 
had 
absolutely 
no 

reservations when I voted Your Michigan 
for CSG president and 
vice president. If you’d 
like to see a CSG that’s 
more effective, efficient 
and equitable, I’d highly 
encourage you to vote 
Your Michigan as well.

Hislop is pragmatic and 

results-oriented. 
Your 

Michigan’s platform — 
which includes tangible, 
realistic plans to expand 
and improve mental health care on campus, 
combat sexual assault through peer-to-peer 
education and increase funding for student 
efforts to recruit potential Wolverines from 
underrepresented backgrounds — reflects that.

I sat down with Hislop and his running 

mate, Cam Dotson, to discuss their priorities 
for their presidency and vice presidency if 
elected. After three years of watching CSG 
administrations spend undue amounts of 
time engaging non-actionable issues — like 
whether or not to advise the University 
of Michigan to divest from all firms doing 
substantive business in Israel — I wanted to 
know whether the duo had a realistic idea 
of what CSG could accomplish. I asked them 
what they thought, fundamentally, they 
believed to be the role of CSG on campus. 

“CSG is here to improve the day-to-day life 

of the Michigan student,” Hislop said. “That 
is their primary role — to support them, to 
make them feel safe, to make sure they feel 
comfortable here and to make sure that the 
resources they have are there for them and 
are the best that they can be.”

Your Michigan’s policies start with this 

fundamental understanding. They prioritize 
issues that matter most to students and have 
solid implementation strategies that target 
the biggest challenge to resource creation 
and program support — funding. To name 
just one example, Hislop and Dotson plan 
to relocate funding from low- to high-
impact projects by analyzing uptake rates 
of seemingly underused resources, like bus 
services at odd times.

But perhaps the best example of the duo’s 

superior issue prioritization is a policy that 
they don’t support, not one they do.

The Daily’s editorial board endorsed 

newMICH candidates Schafer and Griggs 
largely due to their plans to work toward 
creating a non-voting, ex-officio position 
for a student representative on the Board 
of 
Regents. 
The 
representative 
would 

essentially serve as a student liaison to the 
board to advocate for, well, students. They 
argue that this would be better than the 
status quo, where the CSG president attends 
and speaks at every formal regents meeting. 

Having spent a considerable amount of 

time studying the legal organization of the 
University, I can tell you that attempting to 
create this position would essentially be a 
waste of time and energy. Further, it might 
not be possible without changing the state 
constitution. 

The 
University 
is 
what’s 
called 
a 

constitutional corporation. Basically, that 
means that, though created and funded by 
the state of Michigan, the state has absolutely 
nothing to do with its operations, in the 
exact same way it has nothing to do with the 
operations of, say, Taco Bell.

But, while Taco Bell and its private 

sector 
peers 
are 
established 
through 

documents called their charters or articles 
of 
incorporation, 
the 
University 
was 

established through the state constitution. 
Just as all corporations are bound by 

their charters or articles 
of 
incorporation, 
the 

University is bound by the 
constitutional 
provisions 

that establish it. These 
provisions 
specify 
the 

number of regents and 
how they will be selected.

The state constitution 

specifically 
creates 
an 

ex-officio, 
non-voting 

position on the board for the 

student council president.

There’s little question that whatever 

position can be created on the board for a 
new student representative wouldn’t be 
a voting one. At the very least, it would 
be another ex-officio position. But even 
creating another ex-officio position for 
the new student representative would be 
“undoubtedly questionable” as the Daily 
itself admits in its newMICH endorsement. 
More 
than 
that, 
it’s 
a 
question 
of 

constitutional law. 

If this student role is possible at all, it 

would require the Regents to amend their 
bylaws to create the position. If they refuse, 
Shafer and Griggs have little recourse out 
of court. Given that the CSG president 
already has a powerful voice with the Board 
of Regents, the next CSG executive team 
would be far better served by using that 
voice to advocate for increased resources for 
students — which is exactly what Hislop and 
Dotson plan to do.

Your Michigan’s candidates understand 

University governance, and they know 
that pushing for a student on the Board 
of Regents won’t be an effective way to 
secure change that improves students’ lives. 
Instead, they prioritize tangible results and 
realistic plans for action.

If you want your CSG to make real changes 

on campus, vote for the candidates who know 
how to enact it. Vote Hislop and Dotson for 
CSG president and vice president.

O

n slow news days last 
semester, The Michigan 
Daily opinion staff would 

sit around the 
conference room 
table, 
scouring 

the 
Internet 

for 
anything 

interesting 
to 
talk 
about. 

Derek (my then 
co-editorial page 
editor) 
would 

enthusiastically 
break 
the 

silence: 
“Let’s 

talk about the 
deer cull!”

“Absolutely not,” I mechanically 

commanded every time somebody 
broached the subject. “We are not 
talking about the stupid deer cull. 
Keep looking.”

In August 2015, the Ann Arbor 

City Council voted 8-1 in support 
of 
contracting 
professional 

sharpshooters 
to 
decrease 
the 

number of deer in the city over the 
next four years. Two successive 
resolutions clarifying plans for 
the cull passed 10-1. In all of the 
resolutions regarding the deer cull, 
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor (D) was the only voter to 
dissent, believing there was not 
enough community consensus to 
warrant the cull.

“I 
fully 
emphasize 
and 

appreciate the concerns with the 
deer-human interaction.” Taylor 
said after the initial City Council 
vote last August. “At the same time, 
there are many members of the 
community whose sense of place 
in their city will be substantially 
affected by shooting deer within 
our borders,”

To an extent, I agree with 

Taylor: 
The 
city 
government 

should not ostracize its citizens 
or diminish residents’ opinions 
through its resolutions. Hundreds 
of residents feel very strongly 
about the deer population in their 
hometown. They want the city to 
seek alternative solutions, and the 
city owes its residents a proper 
and thorough investigation into all 
issues of concern. 

But the most vocal opposition to 

the cull comes from the Humane 
Society of Huron Valley, headed 
by Tanya Hilgendorf, and local 
animal rights groups such as “Save 
the Deer.” Their main argument 
against the deer cull is based on 
ideas of nonviolence, innovation 
and the ethical treatment of all 
living things.

“I was always in awe of this 

cultural and intellectual mecca,” 
one resident said in reference to 
the Ann Arbor community during a 
November City Council discussion 
of the deer cull. “What happened 
to seeking creative, non-violent 
solutions? Where are the best and 
brightest now?” 

I 
understand 
the 
resistance 

against the deer cull — I really do. 
Personally, I am awed by our Earth. 
All living things are important 
and contribute to the lives humans 
lead; we should be respectful and 
considerate of all life; we should be 
innovative and find solutions that 
result in minimal harm.

But the belief that physically 

reducing 
the 
deer 
population 

perpetuates the most harm is a 
privileged 
(and 
slightly 
naive) 

perception.

***
Before human settlement, the 

wetlands, bogs and semi-forested 
areas of lower Michigan offered 
deer 
herds 
protection 
from 

predators and an abundance of 
vegetation to eat. However, by 1870, 
deforestation 
and 
unregulated 

hunting led to the extermination 
of deer in the southern part 
of 
Michigan. 
Meanwhile, 

deforestation in northern Michigan 
created an environment for deer 
populations to flourish.

Near the end of the 19th century, 

the 
state 
government 
began 

implementing methods to control 

deer populations. In 1915, William 
Oates, game commissioner at the 
Department of Natural Resources, 
estimated that there were only 
45,000 deer left in Michigan. Soon 
after, Oates proposed the “buck 
law” to the state legislature: A 
proposal that suggested hunters 
should only be allowed to take 
down one buck per hunting season.

With the implementation of 

strict hunting laws, coinciding 
with yet another change in deer 
habitat, Michigan’s deer population 
rebounded. In the 1930s, field 
investigators reported a shortage 
of deer food and shelter in the 
cedar-swamps they had examined. 
In 1937, Ilo Bartlett, Michigan’s 

first deer biologist, claimed there 
was a combined 1.125 million deer 
in the upper and lower peninsulas. 
Despite action to reverse the 
dramatic increase in deer, the 
population reached a peak at 1.5 
million in 1949.

Twenty-three 
years 
later, 

Michigan’s deer population fell by 1 
million. However, the major factor 
in the reduction of deer wasn’t 
the more lenient hunting laws, but 
rather an increased loss of and 
damage to deer habitats.

To remedy these losses, Wildlife 

Division 
Chief 
Merrill 
“Pete” 

Petoskey and staff biologist John 
Byelich developed the Deer Range 
Improvement Program. In 1971, part 
of the funds garnered from selling 
hunting licenses was earmarked for 
commercial forestry. Through the 
creation of 70,000 acres of forest 
openings, conservationists worked to 

improve the lives of Michigan deer.

In 1989, the DNR’s efforts — with 

the effect of several mild winters 
and the public’s feeding of deer 
— helped the Michigan deer herd 
reach a new high: an estimated 
2 
million 
deer. 
Deer-vehicle 

accidents and signs of distress 
among deer populations increased 
once again.

***
Today, the DNR and other deer 

conservationist groups aim to 
maintain a balanced doe-to-buck 
ratio. Deer management is its area 
of expertise; it has been trying 
to support ecological balance by 
monitoring wildlife. While plenty 
of mistakes have been made 
during the century that Michigan 
has been grappling with its deer 
population, the DNR and other 
conservationists 
holistically 

understand the lives of deer and 
their effects on the environment.

According to the DNR’s website, 

“State government has a legal 
mandate and moral responsibility 
to act, even if contrary to public 
will, where the integrity of the 
resource is threatened. Thus, the 
real challenge of the future of deer 
management will be to carefully 
sort out the social from biological, 
to respond to the will of the 
public for the former, and to take 
leadership, even if unpopular, for 
the latter.”

Humans 
have 
irrevocably 

interfered 
with 
the 
natural 

trajectory 
and 
populations 
of 

animals. To say otherwise is to 
ignore history and the effects it 
has on life today. To protect the 
lives of 100 deer because they are 
cute, fluffy mammals that are 
increasingly visible in urban and 
suburban lives is hypocritical.

Fences may keep deer out of 

our yards, but what about the rest 
of the ecosystem? What about the 
marbled salamander, Hungerford’s 
crawling water beetle, the barn 
owl, the smoky shrew or the 
dozens of other species currently 
on Michigan’s list of Species of 
Greatest Conservation Need? Why 
are deer — who often have negative 
effects on some threatened species 
— more important than other living 
things? Why are we questioning 
conservationists’ 
sense 
of 

ecological balance when they have 
been managing deer for decades?

In 
retrospect, 
I 
shouldn’t 

have shut down all conversation 
about the deer cull last semester. 
Editorial boards are inherently 
supposed to be democratic and my 
complete refusal to approach the 
subject was slightly dictatorial. 
However, despite all of my research 
and reading, my stance on the cull 
has yet to change.

Maybe it’s because I’m from a 

rural area where people rely on 
hunting to survive. Maybe it’s 
because all of the deer meat has 
been used to provide for hungry 
families. Maybe it’s because I care 
more about the wildflowers than 
the deer. Or maybe it’s because I 
listened to the deer experts who 
have come to a consensus: Far 
worse ecological disasters can 
happen without deer control.

Watch out for Moe Wagner

T

hough the story is one 
you’ll want to hear again, 
it’s not the story itself 

that matters. 
It’s the way 
Moritz 
Wagner tells 
it — with a 
smile on his 
face, fighting 
through 
laughter, 
capturing the 
attention of 
the five or six 
teammates 
within a 10-foot radius of his chair 
in Michigan’s locker room.

“I crossed over Chamberlain,” 

the 18-year-old German says 
proudly.

Chamberlain?
Redshirt freshman forward 

D.J. Wilson leans over to 
clarify: “He’s talking about Wilt 
Chamberlain.”

Wagner nods. “Jerry West, 

too.”

It makes sense that it’s Wagner 

who has changed Michigan’s team 
dynamic down the stretch. This 
type of unbridled enthusiasm and 
energy is Wagner’s specialty.

The difference between 

November and now? Wagner has 
learned to bring that energy from 
the locker room to the court, and 
on the court, it’s shaking things 
up in a big way.

Wagner’s triumph over two of 

the greatest players of all time, 
of course, happened months ago. 
More importantly, it happened 
in NBA 2K16, the video game 
— a fantasy matchup pitting an 
old-school squad starring The 
Logo and Wilt the Stilt against 

Wagner’s old German club, Alba 
Berlin.

The youngest player on 

Michigan’s roster this season, 
Wagner is also the only player 
to have a digital likeness. He 
brings it up sometimes, but his 
teammates aren’t impressed.

“He’s terrible,” Wilson said 

of Wagner’s 2K character, even 
citing his player rating. “He’s like 
a 56 (out of 100).”

But this is March 10, in 

the wake of Michigan’s Big 
Ten Tournament win over 
Northwestern, and Wagner 
is playing spot minutes. He’s 
still a week away from causing 
painful decibel levels in a 
packed NBA arena, energizing a 
team and a fanbase as he leaves 
hints of Mitch McGary’s 2013 
Big Dance explosiveness right 
and left.

But back to 2K. Wagner takes 

issues with Wilson’s assessment 
of his character, leading to more 
stories of video-game triumphs, 
then a debate: Who’s the 
Wolverines’ top gun in 2K?

Wagner’s says it’s him, but 

sophomore forward Kam 
Chatman, entirely unaware of 
the instant fame he’ll experience 
the next day against Indiana, is 
having none of it. Neither are 
other teammates — “I beat him 
eight straight times,” Wilson says 
— and Wagner folds quickly.

“I’m bad,” Wagner says 

sheepishly, about 10 seconds after 
claiming he’s the best on the team.

Fast-forward a week, and 

Wagner still isn’t experiencing a 
crisis of confidence.

He’s gobbling up the basketball 

and delivering an enormous put-

back dunk in Dayton to send the 
Wolverines past Tulsa in a First 
Four game. He’s making two 
first-half appearances against 
Notre Dame and scoring within 
seconds of checking in both times, 
bringing thousands of Michigan 
fans at the Barclays Center to 
their feet. He’s dribbling the ball 
between his legs and taking the 
ball to the rack with the shot 
clock winding down, only to 
be whistled for a questionable 
and game-changing charge call 
that has the referee warning 
Michigan’s bench, nearly hitting 
Spike Albrecht with a technical 
foul.

Charge or no, technical or 

no, one thing is clear: Wagner 
is the energy generator the 
Wolverines lacked all season 
long. Michigan assistant coach 
Bacari Alexander describes it as a 
“youthful exuberance,” but lately, 
it seems to be more than just that. 
Accompanying the exuberance, 
the happiness and the happy-go-
lucky locker-room mentality is an 
underlying intensity that didn’t 
show until the season’s final 
weeks.

It’s there now, for the whole 

basketball world to see. Wagner 
is still raw, still developing, still 
growing into a 6-foot-11 frame 
that will be a sight to behold once 
he fills it out. Wagner arrived 
in Ann Arbor at 211 pounds, but 
quickly jumped to 228 after just 
a few months of weight training 
and American food.

With a full summer ahead 

of him and a love for Chipotle 
long since revealed, it’s easy to 
imagine Wagner undergoing a 
massive physical transformation 

this summer. Wilson, Wagner 
and sophomore forward Ricky 
Doyle all emerged from Michigan 
strength coach Jon Sanderson’s 
famed boot camp with double-
digit weight gains, and Wagner’s 
frame is still the one with the 
most space for added weight and 
muscle.

Regardless of size, Wagner is a 

player who’s capable of changing 
games in a moment.

“He came (to Ann Arbor) in 

July,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein after the Tulsa game. 
“He’s from Germany. He’s still 
only 18 years old today. So he’s 

been away from home a long time, 
and he’s done well. He brings me 
energy every day. He’s a terrific 
kid.”

Wagner’s nature has never 

been in question. He’s a favorite 
of teammates, fans and the media 
alike, and when he steps on the 
court, he’s impossible to miss.

Beilein’s early-season warning 

rang true — there will be times 
when Wagner appears lost on 
the court and there will be 
times when Wagner drops jaws, 
like he did with a thunderous 
step-across dunk at North 
Carolina State in December or a 

surprise, unsanctioned 3-pointer 
against Indiana in the Big Ten 
Tournament.

With a season of American 

college hoops under his belt and 
likely a shape-shifting offseason 
ahead, watch out for more of Moe. 
The awkward moments aren’t 
quite gone yet, but if Michigan is 
lucky enough to hold onto Wagner 
for the duration of his eligibility, 
he’ll be dropping jaws around Ann 
Arbor for years to come.

Motte, Compher, 
Connor replicate 
1994 ‘Hobey’ feat

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team’s 

first line has been making 
headlines for a while now. And 
on March 16, it made another.

Last 
Wednesday, 
the 
top 

10 
finalists 
for 
the 
Hobey 

Baker Memorial Award were 
announced 
— 
and 
it’s 
no 

surprise that Kyle Connor, JT 
Compher and Tyler Motte were 
among them.

The trio has set the Big Ten 

ablaze this season, with Connor 
leading the nation in goals 
and points, and Compher first 
nationally 
in 
assists. 
Motte 

has been exceptional himself, 
trailing Connor’s scoring total 
by just four goals.

The announcement marked 

just the third time since the 
award’s inception in 1981 that 
three players from the same 
team broke the top 10, fitting for 
a line that has been so dominant.

The last year it happened was 

1994, when Michigan assistant 
coaches Brian Wiseman and 
Steve Shields donned the maize 
and blue sweater with fellow 
nominee David Oliver.

Though 
Connor, 
Compher 

and Motte have largely pushed 
the award to the backs of their 
minds, 
having 
their 
names 

written below their coaches’ 
in the history book is still 
something they can appreciate.

“(Being grouped with) the 

three guys, it’s just an honor,” 
Compher said. “It’s not the goal 
of our team, and that’s to win 
NCAA games and make the 
Frozen Four. (But) we thought 
about it for a couple minutes, 
congratulated each other. We 
had practice that day and it was 
back to normal.”

The 
original 
Michigan 

trio 
was 
nothing 
short 
of 

phenomenal in 1994 on the 
way to the NCAA Tournament 
quarterfinals. Wiseman led the 
Wolverines in scoring with 69 
points, Oliver scored 28 goals 
with 40 assists and Shields held 

a 2.66 goals-against average.

On top of the individual 

achievement, 
they 
were 

freshmen 
when 
Michigan’s 

streak of 22 consecutive NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances 

began.

Now, the current top line has 

a chance to jumpstart to a new 
streak, and one of them may 
have the opportunity to take 
home one trophy that Wiseman, 
Shields and Oliver couldn’t. 
But to do so may be even more 
difficult than usual with all 
three in contention.

Back in 1994, none of the 

Wolverines 
won 
the 
Hobey 

Baker. In retrospect, Shields and 
Wiseman agreed that the three 
of them making the top 10 might 
have hurt Oliver’s chances.

“He was Player of the Year in 

the CCHA that year,” Wiseman 
said. “He was a dominant player, 
a dominant goal scorer. If David 
Oliver was the only one, I think 
the outcome might be different.”

Added 
Shields: 
“(My 

nomination) was probably based 
on my career, but David Oliver 
had the best year of any college 
player. I don’t know how the 
voting gets split or whatever, 
but the guy who won — and no 
disrespect to him — but David 
Oliver was the best player in 
the country. It was too bad for 
David, but Wiseman was the 
other best player in the country, 
and I was (just) happy to be on 
the list.”

Their experience in 1994 

raises the question if history 
will repeat itself.

After 
being 
put 
together 

in early December, the trio, 
now dubbed the “CCM line,” 
has wrought havoc on the 
Big Ten. Entering the NCAA 
Tournament, Connor, Compher 
and Motte are first, second, 
and fourth in points nationally, 
respectively.

Even with numbers that could 

make the award committee 
do double takes, 1994 may be 
evidence: 
two 
is 
company, 

three’s a crowd.

The Michigan men’s lacrosse team couldn’t hold off a late Marist rally Wednesday night at Michigan Stadium.
Wolverines fall to Marist

Red Foxes mount 
late comeback, 

knock off Michigan 

at the Big House

By MIKE PERSAK

Daily Sports Writer

It has been a tough stretch 

for 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
lacrosse 
team over the past two weeks. 
It suffered a blowout loss to 
then-No. 5 Brown on March 
12, and it failed to complete a 
comeback against Dartmouth 

on March 19.

Wednesday, the Wolverines 

had an opportunity to right 
the ship against Marist with 
nine minutes left in the fourth 
quarter. Holding a 6-3 lead, 
they looked primed to do just 
that. 

But 
then, 

the Red Foxes 
mounted 
a 

comeback 
of 

their 
own, 

scoring three 
goals in just 
over 
six 

minutes to tie 
the score at 
six and force overtime.

With its back against the 

wall at a potential turning 

point in the season, Michigan 
needed some leadership from 
somewhere, anywhere, to score 
a goal and put the team on the 
right track. There was only one 
problem: The Wolverines’ two 
leading scorers, junior attacker 

Ian 
King 

and 
senior 

attacker Kyle 
Jackson, were 
watching 
from 
the 

sidelines with 
injuries.

The 
high-

scoring 
tandem 

was replaced by a group of 
inexperienced 
freshmen 

and 
sophomores. 
Freshmen 

attackers Rocco Sutherland and 
Brent Noseworthy, along with 
freshman midfielder Decker 
Curran, compiled a combined 
three goals and two assists, but 
fell short of completely filling 
the hole that King and Jackson 
left behind. Marist ultimately 
topped Michigan, 7-6.

“I 
thought 
(Sutherland, 

Noseworthy 
and 
Curran) 

looked like freshmen at times,” 
said Michigan coach John Paul. 
“I think they’re capable … it’s 
the first time (they) have had 
this kind of weight on their 
shoulders. I thought they did 
some good things and made 
some good plays, but they also 
looked like it was the first time 
with this kind of weight on 
their shoulders.”

Despite the lack of offensive 

firepower for the Wolverines, 
they held up tough on the 
defensive end for most of the 
game. Junior goalie Gerald 
Logan faced 36 shots while 
allowing seven goals, and he 
stood toe to toe for most of the 
night with Marist goalie Brian 
Corrigan, who boasts the third-
best save percentage in the 
country.

Additionally, 
like 
in 

Saturday’s 
game 
against 

Dartmouth, Michigan actually 
had the advantage in many 
statistical categories. Senior 
faceoff man Brad Lott won 
the faceoff battle again, and 
the team had the advantage in 
ground balls as well.

“I liked our energy today,” 

Paul said. “I thought it was 
a lot better than it was this 
weekend. That was something 
we focused on.”

Though the Wolverines now 

have a week and a half to right 
their wrongs and get healthier 
before their next game, their 
schedule doesn’t get any easier. 
The team prepares to welcome 
Maryland to Michigan Stadium 
on April 2.

“They’re certainly one of the 

best teams we’re going to face 
all year,” Paul said. “So we’ve 
got to get this past us, and 
we’ll see how tough we are on 
Monday.”

It is currently unknown 

when Jackson and King will 
be able to return, but while 
Jackson is sporting a walking 
boot and King is in a sling, 
Michigan will need to look to 
someone else to head in the 
right direction.

Seven Mile Music 

Brings Harmony 

to Detroit

People have been noticing 

the salubrious effects of music 
for a long time. Both in regard 
to individuals and the public at 
large, its health benefits have 
been trumpeted by musicians, 
scientists and perhaps overly 
enthused devotees the world 
over. Studies of varying veracity 
have linked listening to and 
participating in music with 
everything 
from 
improved 

immune systems to heightened 
computational ability, in some 
cases leading to cultural waves 
which 
gathered 
cult-like 

followings (for instance, the 
“Mozart 
Effect” 
movement, 

born out of a particular widely 
misunderstood 
study). 
In 

recent years the fields of music 
therapy 
and 
the 
cognitive 

neuroscience of music have 
flourished, borne aloft by public 
goodwill and interest driven by 
both the intriguing nature of 
contemporary discoveries and 
pop-science proselytizers (see: 
Oliver Sacks “Musicophilia”).

But in addition to music’s 

effects on the individual, there’s 
also great interest in its health 
effects — in the less literal, 
non-anatomically 
inclined 

sense — on society. Music has 
been shown to be an excellent 
tool for building communities, 
strengthening bonds between 

groups of people and providing 
a collective sense of purpose, 
particularly when children are 
involved. This isn’t either a new 
idea or a secret — even as early 
as 1837, when Lowell Mason’s 
dream of public music education 
became a reality in Boston, a 
report submitted in support of 
his proposal cited many of these 
same concepts (along with a 
few other reasons that sound 
a bit ridiculous today, such as 
“It appears self-evident that 
exercises in vocal Music, when 
not carried to an un-reasonable 
excess, 
must 
expand 
the 

chest, and thereby strengthen 
the lungs and vital organs,” 
which laughably argued that 
singing 
could 
cure/prevent 

tuberculosis).

Most 
notably 
in 
recent 

years, however, a Venezuelan 
program 
colloquially 
known 

as El Sistema has achieved 
massive international renown 
for 
its 
successes. 
Founded 

in 1975 by the musician and 
activist José Antonio Abreu, 
El Sistema started with a mere 
11 students rehearsing music 
in 
an 
underground 
parking 

garage and the goal of lifting 
economically 
disadvantaged 

children out of poverty. Of El 
Sistema’s mission, Abreu has 
remarked, “Music has to be 

recognized as an agent of social 
development … it has the ability 
to unite an entire community, 
and to express sublime feelings.” 
By others, El Sistema has been 
described 
as 
a 
remarkably 

successful public health project. 
In 
the 
intervening 
decades 

since its founding, El Sistema 
has expanded to include over 
500,000 students and inspired 
similar 
programs 
in 
other 

nations (including the United 
States), 
where 
the 
concept 

has 
been 
warmly 
received. 

Laudation has been in plentiful 
supply; in 2009, Abreu and El 
Sistema were awarded the TED 
Prize (as in TED Talks), and in 
2007 one of El Sistema’s star 
students, 
Gustavo 
Dudamel 

(perhaps best known outside 
of the music community as the 
crazy hair conductor meme), 
was named to follow the highly 
respected Esa-Pekka Salonen 
as music director of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, a post 
which he still holds and likely 
will hold for several years to 
come.

But after all of that, it is 

important to remember that 40 
years ago, El Sistema began as a 
small program made up of just a 
few students and leaders with a 
vision — a description that could 
apply equally well to Detroit’s 

Seven Mile Music.

“It’s 
certainly 
the 
same 

concept,” 
Sam 
Saunders, 

founder and president of Seven 
Mile Music, said of his program’s 
similarities to the Venezuelan 
program in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “I think 
(Seven Mile Music) is in line 
with El Sistema … in that its 
focus is to allow access to 
everyone, not just those with 
the means previously.”

Saunders — who is a senior 

studying 
music 
composition 

and piano performance at the 
University of Michigan School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
— started Seven Mile Music 
in the fall of 2013, with the 
aim of providing free music 
lessons to Detroit’s inner-city 
youths, taught by University 
students. Beginning with the 
neighborhood of Brightmoor, 
Saunders hoped to fill what 
he saw as a distressing void in 
the opportunities available to 
children from the city.

“I 
just 
found 
that 
(for) 

children in some of the roughest 
areas, 
there 
were 
just 
no 

resources coming to them. In 
many ways, but particularly 
in music, I saw almost none of 
it,” Saunders said. “I read that 
Detroit was cutting all funding 
to arts and music in the schools, 

and that sort of affected me 
personally because I knew how 
important music was to get me 
out of a sort of rough situation 
… I knew how important music 
would be for certain children to 
rise above their circumstance. 
So I thought particularly in a 
city like Detroit, it was just a 
crime to do away with music 
education.”

Saunders began Seven Mile 

with very little in terms of a 
support network, and the road 
to its founding was challenging. 
Without knowing anyone in 
the area, Saunders started by 
driving down Seven Mile Road, 
in the heart of Detroit, stopping 
at every church and community 
center to propose his idea — 
where he was met with reactions 
ranging 
from 
suspicion 
to 

welcome. Eventually, Saunders 
found the perfect environment 
for the program.

“I came upon Brightmoor, 

which is just known as one of the 
worse-off areas of the city, and I 
went to the community center, 
and I met the leader of the 
community center, a man named 
Dennis Talbert,” Saunders said. 
“And he was so supportive of the 
music program, he just couldn’t 
contain his excitement about it.”

There were many things about 

Brightmoor that made Saunders 

feel that his idea could work 
well within the community, 
not the least of which were the 
people he met.

“I 
started 
meeting 
more 

people around here, and I saw 
that Brightmoor really has a 
grassroots community of leaders 
from within who are really 
working to make it a better 
place,” Saunders said. “I saw the 
combination of a neighborhood 
that lacked many resources but 
also had a lot of positive energy, 
and it just seemed like a perfect 
fit.”

In the years since, Seven 

Mile has expanded in scale and 
attracted some attention. In 
2015, Brightmoor and Seven 
Mile Music were the subject of a 
documentary short called “The 
Key of B,” previously reported 
on in the Daily.

Much has been written and 

said about the economic plight 
of Detroit, the generalities of 
which are universally known 
enough that reprinting them 
here would be unnecessary. 
Let it suffice to say that when 
I accompanied Saunders and 
other members of Seven Mile 
into 
Brightmoor 
that 
the 

dilapidated state of many of the 
houses we passed confirmed a 
great deal of what is said about

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

A broken record sputters 

and repeats, much like the 
opening of Little Scream’s 
“Love As a Weapon” music 
video. Zooming out of an 
ornate frame, 
the shot 
reveals singer 
Laurel Spren-
gelmeyer 
lounging in a 
wooden chair, 
surrounded 
by wood-pan-
eled walls. The scene changes 
only slightly with each repeti-
tion, not unlike a game of spot 
the difference. The rest of the 
video follows in an equally 
quizzical fashion: metallic 
hands dancing in American 
Sign Language, tube lighting 
illuminating a man voguing 
and Sprengelmeyer dancing in 
a brightly lit entryway wear-
ing a sequined windbreaker 
as he sings, “Remember your 
greatest gift is to dance.”

The majority of the video is 

surreal, making it impossible 

for viewers to place the house 
in which the actions take 
place at a certain point in time 
or space — decades and genres 
are spanned. There doesn’t 
seem to be any connecting force 
between the barrage of scenes, 
colors and movements other 
than their randomness. It’s not 
until the shot again moves to 
the picture frame that opened 
the video that the pieces begin 
to fall into place. Continuing 

out through the frame hanging 
upon the wall, Sprengelmeyer is 
shown walking down a snowy 
lane alone, repeating “gonna 
work it out, gonna work it out.” 
As this sentiment echoes, we 
see Sprengelmeyer strutting 
through the snow, puzzling 
the same conundrum as the 
audience — how to make sense 
of the home within her head.

the city but my observations 

at our destination also lead me 
to lend credence to Saunders’s 
statements regarding the posi-
tive energy of the community.

The trip in which I took part 

was actually one of Seven Mile’s 
newer 
offshoot 
programs, 

dedicated to a combination of 
visual art and creative writing. 
The art program goes to the 
neighborhood 
on 
a 
weekly 

basis. There are also two weekly 
music trips, a large trip with 
about 20 teachers on Fridays 
and a smaller trip with about 
six on Wednesdays. We arrived 
at the building of Mission: 
City — one of Seven Mile’s 
community center partners — 
around 7 p.m., finding a handful 
of 
students 
finishing 
some 

tutoring sessions. 

The common room of Mis-

sion: City had the smell of an 
elementary school classroom 
and complimentarily themed 
decor (an example: a poster of 
check-boxes, reading “Bullies 
are: Not Cool, Not Friendly, Not 
Popular, Not Respected, Not 
Welcome, All of the Above,” the 
last option of which bore a big 
red checkmark). To our right a 
boy was constructing a Eiffel 
Tower-like 
structure 
using 

gumdrops and toothpicks. On 
the back wall of the community 
center there were several rows 
of uniquely patterned tiles, 
each apparently hand-crafted 
and bearing the name of a per-
son or group to which it was 
presumably dedicated.

While I conducted an inter-

view with Saunders, students 
worked with Seven Mile’s art 
teachers on a Van Gogh-themed 
project. At the beginning of 
the activity, students wrote 
haikus about sunflowers, and 
then proceeded to draw their 
own sunflower images, using 
Van Gogh’s famous painting as 
a model. In a side room of the 
building, a couple of boys could 
be heard drumming on a table 
with markers, prompting Cece 
Simonsen, a teacher with Seven 
Mile, to say to Saunders, “Go 
talk to them; they should join 
the drum corps” — another of 
Seven Mile’s more recent pro-
grams.

During the course of the 

trip, Saunders showed me a 
closet full of the instruments 
Seven Mile uses, a collection 
of various keyboards, violins, 
cellos 
and 
guitars, 
most 

of 
which 
were 
purchased 

using money collected via a 
GoFundMe page. Like many 
nonprofit organizations, Seven 
Mile is frequently low on 
monetary resources, and relies 
upon public donations given 
through either their GoFundMe 
page or website. Currently, the 

organization is in the middle 
of an instrument drive, the 
goal of which is to collect both 
instruments and funds with 
which to buy more.

“We’re doing an instrument 

drive with Spring Fest, with 
Music Matters … that’s the thing 
we’ve been (flyering) around 
campus about,” said LSA junior 
Mike Payne, Seven Mile Music’s 
board chair.

“For the students who aren’t 

able — because of time com-
mitments or for other reasons 
— who aren’t actually able to 
help us out by being a teacher, 
by being a volunteer, they still 
can do something,” Payne con-
tinued. “If you haven’t played 
an instrument in a while, and 
you’ve put it down for a while, 
and you’re sort of at that point 
where you think you’ve moved 
on from it — that instrument 
still has a lot of value, especial-
ly to the students that we work 
with that wouldn’t otherwise 
get the opportunity to play. It 
could sit at home or it could be 
in the hands of a child.” 

In addition to the programs 

Seven Mile offers during the 
academic year, they also operate 
a summer camp in Brightmoor 
called Brightmoor Arts Camp, 
which has very similar aims to 
the main program, with slight 
additions.

“It’s an eight-week program 

… the goal was to bring in some 
of the teachers we already had, 
but also bring in teachers and 
musicians from the community 
to make sure that the music 
and culture of the area was still 
being cultivated,” Payne said. 
“It really was something that 
was sourced from Detroit.”

During the course of the 

previous 
summer 
camp, 

Saunders lived in Brightmoor 
in order to better get to know 
the 
community. 
Following 

his 
graduation 
from 
the 

University 
this 
semester, 

Saunders plans to move back to 
the neighborhood to continue 
growing the program as much 
as he can during a planned gap 
year before attending graduate 
school.

“I’ve always dreamed big 

for this,” Saunders said. “I see 
this at first spreading to the 
(rest of the) city of Detroit … 
and then spreading around 
Michigan — Flint, Saginaw, 
Benton Harbor — some of the 
more underprivileged areas of 
Michigan.”

In addition to the state 

of 
Michigan, 
Saunders 
has 

long-term 
goals 
for 
Seven 

Mile, which include dramatic 
expansion.

“I definitely want it to go 

national,” Saunders said. “I 
think there is a need for this 
all over. I see a model where 
we provide start-ups at other 
universities 
— 
like 
Johns 

Hopkins in Baltimore, we would 
provide an umbrella funding, 
curriculum, everything needed 
for a motivated student at Johns 
Hopkins to start a subsidiary 
program. I really want it to 
expand nationally, and I see 
that happening through the 
collegiate system.”

Part of the reason why 

Saunders 
is 
so 
passionate 

about 
bringing 
music 
to 

disadvantaged children is his 
own early experiences with it, 
and the transformative effect it 
had on his life.

“I started playing piano when 

I was about 10, and it really got 
me on a better track in life,” 
Saunders said. “I was just not 
doing well in school, I was not 
doing well socially, I just wasn’t 
doing well all around. And I 
discovered a love of music, I 
discovered I had a talent for it 
and I just discovered an outlet 
for myself.”

Saunders also cited the posi-

tive social health effects of 
music, particularly emphasiz-
ing the impact it could have on 
children from underprivileged 
backgrounds.

“Just on the most basic level, 

I think it is the purest form of 
emotional expression, so par-
ticularly a child in a troubled 
circumstance, with a lot of 
emotions welling up inside of 
them, it gives them an outlet 
for those emotions,” Saunders 
said. “It’s not like these emo-
tions disappear — either there’s 
an outlet or they fester and 
grow into something worse, 
like depression or violence. A 
lot of children in a neighbor-
hood like Brightmoor have very 
few extracurricular activities 
… so they have very little to do 
with their time. Combine noth-
ing to do with a very troubled 
situation and you often have a 
child getting into a bad circum-
stance.”

While expressing a wish to 

not overstate what he believed 
Seven Mile could accomplish 
— mentioning that the program 
would likely simply be a bright 
spot in the week for many of its 
students — Saunders did display 
optimism about the sort of 
existence-altering effects Seven 
Mile could possibly create. 

“I think it does have the 

potential to be transformative,” 
Saunders said. “If we find a 
couple children that really have 
the aptitude and passion for it, 
then this really could change 
the whole trajectory of their 
lives.”

Since 
1928, 
the 
Michigan 

Theater 
has 
existed 
as 
a 

bastion of community culture. 
It 
was 
originally 
designed 

as a “movie palace” — an 
institution characteristic of the 
era — for silent films and stage 
productions. In these early years, 
it was common to preface films 
with a 30-minute stage show 
complete with an orchestra and 
pipe organ, which has persisted 
as an essential fixture of the 
theater.

It’s 
nothing 
short 
of 

extraordinary for the Michigan 
Theater to boast two of these 
musical rarities, considering only 
7,000 were assembled during 
the limited heyday of theater 
organ production, spanning from 
1912 until 1932. These theater 
organs are a special type of pipe 
organ designed specifically for 
silent 
film 
accompaniments. 

Their ranks, or sets, of pipes, 
imitate the instruments of the 
bygone orchestras as much as 
possible — not just the percussive 
instruments of chimes and bells. 

Since 
1971, 
these 
giant 

instruments have dwelled beside 
each stage of the Michigan 
Theater. 
They’re 
loud, 
and 

occasionally 
fear-inducing. 

They accompany theatergoers 
throughout 
the 
emotional 

journey of a silent film, or provide 
a soothing overture to preface 
the daily matinee. Today the 
Barton pipe organ of the main 
theater and the electric organ in 
the screening room are played by 
five organists — Henry Aldridge, 
Andrew Rogers, Stephen Warner, 
Lance Luce and David Hufford — 
and heard each day.

“We are truly blessed to have 

the full support of the Michigan 
Theater staff,” Aldridge wrote 
in an e-mail interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “The Barton is 
an integral part of the theater’s 
activities. Patrons come early to 
the movies just to hear it.”

For 40 years, Aldridge served 

as a professor of electronic 
media and film studies in the 
Department of Communication, 
Media & Theatre arts at Eastern 
Michigan 
University, 
with 

the organ serving as more of 
a hobby. Much like his other 
organist peers, he was always 
interested in music — the church 
pipe organs instantly intrigued 
him as a child. 

“Our church, St. Paul’s, had an 

outstanding music program, and 
I was very familiar with church 
pipe organs,” Aldridge wrote.

During 
his 
undergraduate 

years at the University of North 
Carolina, he began playing a 
small theater organ at the Center 
Theater 
in 
Durham. 
After 

coming to Ann Arbor in l970, 
Aldridge led a team of volunteers 
in working on the Michigan’s 
instrument in l971, beginning to 
play it in public in l972.

He subsequently took theater 

organ lessons from Father Jim 
Miller of Fenton, Mich., through 
whom he met future fellow 
Michigan 
Theater 
organist 

Rogers. In an interview, Rogers 

referred to Father Jim as the best 
instructor in the area.

“Music was always something 

that I tried to do in between 
the cracks of everything else,” 
Rogers said.

What originally served as a 

hobby while Rogers worked at a 
plastics factory and then a travel 
agency 
became 
his 
primary 

source of income. Though Rogers 
now typically plays two to five 
times during the week, he’s 
always willing to substitute for 
fellow organists.

“You like it that much?” the 

Daily asked.

“That and it is my job,” Rogers 

said in response, laughing. “We’re 
really lucky to be here. It’s really 
a gift. To have an original organ 
in its original home is rare.”

The instrument’s rarity surely 

makes it a local treasure, but it 
poses challenges for the primary 
musicians. Theater organs are 
considered a thing of the past, 
and music for them is no longer 
composed.

“They can’t be taken on the 

road, and there aren’t too many 
places to play,” Rogers said. “It’s 
really a double-edged sword.”

With 
minimal 
music 
for 

organists 
today, 
especially 

theater 
organists, 
the 

musicians must take on the 
role of composers and create 
original 
arrangements. 
For 

the organists of the Michigan 
Theater, this typically means 
creating their own film scores 
for upcoming silent films the 
theater will screen. The process 
is lengthy, often spanning two to 
three weeks, during which the 
organists watch the films over 
and over, collecting moments and 
emotions to reflect in the form of 
a compelling composition.

“You’re taking this musical 

material, 
the 
basis, 
the 

melody, the harmony and just 
reorganizing it kind of in real 
time,” Warner, another of the 
organists, said. “You want to 
make what you do a part of the 
movie.”

Usually, 
the 
organists 

start from scratch and watch 
the silent films without the 
provided score. According to 
Rogers, creating a successful 
score often means making sure 
the music doesn’t draw attention 
to itself. Still, the music does 
have the ability to control the 
audience’s expectations. Rogers 
referred to Hitchcock’s silent 
film “The Lodger: A Story of the 
London Fog,” which features a 
woman unwittingly falling for 
a Jack the Ripper-type serial 
killer, as an example.

“Musically, I have to decide 

when to let you know she’s safe 
in his presence,” Rogers said. 
“(By using music), you actually 
control part of the plot.”

“Try to capture the essence of 

what the filmmaker was trying 
to do,” Warner said. “Carry the 
emotion — intensify it, maybe, 
nuance it, but don’t change it.”

Some film scores require 

more 
work 
than 
others. 

Warner said he often creates a 
theme and assigns variations 
to different characters. This 
requires practice playing pieces 
in different styles.

The standard running time 

for these feature-length films is 
70 minutes, but there are some 
more ambitious projects. For 
long films like the often four-
hour-long epics of D.W. Griffith, 
the 
scores 
require 
broader 

brushstrokes; the music doesn’t 
change every 15 seconds.

“I haven’t done (any of those) 

yet,” Warner said. “I don’t know 
if I have the guts to do it.”

The Michigan Theater in 

particular offers the ability to 
expand the musical palates of 
its audiences, and it continually 
offers new opportunities for the 
organists themselves.

“Being in a venue like this, 

you 
can 
be 
experimental,” 

Warner said. “I know I have an 
adventurous audience here.”

To 
these 
organists, 
the 

relative obscurity of available 
organ music and the antiquated 
nature 
of 
the 
instrument 

doesn’t mean it has nothing to 
offer in the modern world. After 
all, the theater organ has always 
faced scrutiny.

“Even in its heyday, there was 

certainly a tension between the 
theater organ and the classical 
organ,” Warner said.

Warner also believes that the 

theater organ still has a place in 
modern music education.

“This is something we should 

actually learn about,” he said. 
“(After all), my personal music 
interests are far before my time. 
I’d love to start bringing back 
some of my pop music.”

Even if organ music never 

does 
make 
a 
significant 

resurgence, it still holds real 
value to the Michigan Theater 
organists.

“The instrument has a huge, 

colorful palate, and it has a 
huge, 
expressive 
capacity,” 

Warner said. “In the end, that’s 
kind of the reason I play it. You 
can have some really magical 
musical moments, singing for 
your audience through this big 
mechanical beast.”

SINGLE REVIEW

Late night, romantic 

ruminations over what could’ve 
been, what has been, and what 
may be; OVO 
Sound’s roster 
has a sizeable 
collection 
of artists 
who foster 
this sound, 
Drake most 
notoriously 
being the 
maestro of 
this aesthetic 
among them. Taking on the 
mantle from the Champagne Papi 
himelf, PARTYNEXTDOOR’s 
first single off his much awaited 
project, P3, is the latest example 
of the histrionic gunslinging of 
emotions that the two artists 
have become well known for.

While “Come And See Me” 

isn’t anything particularly 
groundbreaking or new in 
its content or aesthetic, it’s 

a reassuring message from 
PND, giving fans of his hope 
after 2014’s critically panned 
PNDCOLOURS, his last major 
release. Reminiscent of PND’s 
emotional “Kehlani’s Freestyle/
Things & Such,” the Noah “40” 
Shebib produced track is a great 
backdrop for PND and Drake’s 
signature lamenting lyricism and 
emotional sound. PND claims 
“I’ll admit I’m sorry when I’m 
truly sorry,” and Drake suggests, 
“I know you got another nigga 

tryna play the part / Just cause 
he got a heart don’t mean he got 
heart.”

PND is working with his 

bread and butter in “Come And 
See Me.” That might garner 
some critics, and it may leave 
something to be desired for some 
listeners. But all in all, the soulful 
arrangement of “Come And See 
Me” is a great move if he wants to 
safely drum up hype before P3’s 
release.

Trying to hear it all

By MELINA GLUSAC

Senior Arts Editor

I really don’t want to start 

another piece talking about being 
cooped up in Espresso Royale and 
contemplating life. It’s been done 
before, and if there’s anything a 
burgeoning writer strives to avoid, 
it’s clichés. But I’m here — the walls 
are the kind of red that looks like 
home, the paintings are abstract 
enough to distract me — and I’m 
starting to think. Funny how that 
works.

Espresso is a fine establishment 

that arguably fuels the entire city 
of Ann Arbor, serving up fresh 
brown nectar that nourishes the 
busy bees of town every day. They 
sashay these streets with their bur-
gundy cups in hand, headphones 
on ears, life restored. Buzzing, 
buzzing, buzzing. But since I’ve 
been on a mini caffeine-hiatus late-
ly, I need something more. I don’t 
have a burgundy cup in my hand. 
The 
background 
conversations 

aren’t cutting it today; my eaves-
dropping abilities are kind of rusty. 
Nay, I need a great song to fill the 
void. After all, what else can? Love, 
some say? But what the hell is that?

I’d be lying if I said Espresso’s 

playlists aren’t confusing. At this 
very table, I’ve written an English 
essay to The Bends by Radiohead, 
read “Twelfth Night” to something 
that literally sounded like Gyorgy 
Ligeti’s “Lux Aeterna” and heard 
some good ol’ Marcy Playground 
while sending out about 200 
e-mails in a row. These jams have 
done the job at their respective, 
distracted playtimes, but right now 
music is paramount. I need the real 
good stuff in my ears, the ooey-
gooey fusion of voice and instru-
mentation that will command my 
full attention and sweep me off 
Earth and help me forget.

“So what’s your favorite song?” 

I ask Natasha, Megan and Maddie.

***
Natasha says, “La vie en rose” 

by Edith Piaf. The track is creaky, 
smoky, almost as if it was recorded 
that way on purpose. Cooing brass 
and strings lead the listener in, but 
somehow it doesn’t sound hokey 
— and this bit goes on just long 
enough, mimicking Edith’s iconic 
cadence. Dahhhh, dah dah, dah dah, 
dah dah. The original queen enters: 
“Des yeux qui font baisser les 
miens / Un rire qui se perd sur sa 
bouche.” Come again? “Eyes that 

gaze into mine / A smile that is lost 
on his lips.” Ah, okay. Now we’re 
talking. She’s in that kind of love.

Piaf straddles the fine line 

between desperate longing and 
the simultaneous thrill of a mun-
dane conversation — as long as it’s 
those eyes, those lips, all of it is 
ecstasy. La vie en rose. Her verses 
are a casual tête-à-tête in a Parisian 
café, but her chorus is an amphi-
theater of bended French syllables 
and deep dives into the diaphragm 
that yields the world’s most roman-
tic growl. It’s no wonder the song 
is universally beloved. Somehow, 
Louis Armstrong’s version pales 
in comparison — all covers seem 
weak, inappropriately meek. Piaf 
gave us courage and attitude, and 
she showed us that it was perfectly 
okay to be yourself when you fall in 
love. None of that feigned sugary 
bollocks. Just sweet sass.

And then Megan says, “There is a 

Light that Never Goes Out” by The 
Smiths, which is one of my favorite 
Smiths songs (and songs in gen-
eral). Megan is right on with this 
one. Unfortunately, I can’t help but 
think of Zooey Deschanel when 
I hear it because of the elevator 
scene in “(500) Days of Summer,” 
which aroused every jeans-rolled-
up hipster man in the nation. But 
if you can push the bangs and the 
Manic Pixie Dream Girl “quirk” 
to the way back, “There is a Light” 
shines through.

Morrissey is melancholy but try-

ing his best not to be: “Take me out 
tonight / Where there’s music and 
there’s people / Who are young and 
alive / Driving in your car / I never 
never want to go home.” As he’s on 
the cusp of asking this auspicious 
girl out, he finds he can’t, but he’s 
still so content driving with her. He 
sounds almost childish, clingingly 
puerile when he pleads, “I don’t 
care, I don’t care, I don’t care.” 
Whether that’s the agony of life or 
the agony of love beating at his glo-
rious British chest is uncertain, but 
it’s intoxicating nonetheless.

Like a car driving down a high-

way at night, the song’s drums are 
the engine. The guitar chords are 
forward-thinking; the strings are 
filled with enough whimsy and 
wonder and fleeting phrasing to 
make you think everything is going 
to be okay. “To die by your side is 
such a heavenly way to die,” Mor-
rissey weep-croons. It’s happy. It’s 
sad. It’s us.

And then Maddie says, “Some-

body to Love” by Queen. Ah yes, 
the ultimate ballad of horniness.

Does it get better than this? 

Freddie Mercury is better than 
Morrissey, debatably better than 
Piaf. His voice is obliterating 
everything I just listened to, and 
I’m sitting here smiling like an 
idiot. How did someone combine 
opera and rock so well? Where did 
that voice come from? How is it so 
masculine yet so pretty, and how 
does it overflow with passion while 
still hitting some of the most deli-
cate, crystalline notes in rock ‘n’ 
roll history? I don’t know.

I could go on and on and try to 

dissect it, like I did with the first 
two, but that’s not helping me. I 
can sit here and ponder and pon-
der, wondering why I don’t have 
a favorite song and why my three 
friends were able to rattle off theirs 
so quickly, and I can try to unravel 
the enigma of Mr. Mercury. But 
that won’t give me a favorite song. 
That won’t tell me why sometimes 
I get irrationally freaked out, nor 
will it explain how I can feel incan-
descently glad a few minutes later. 
And we can’t even bring love into 
this, not again.

Music, then, is what we’re left 

with. What I’m left with — always. 
I’m here, in Espresso, with Fred-
die and Edith and Morrissey and 
now Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, and 
they’re talking about everything. 
Songs are a kind of eavesdrop-
ping, a two or three-minute long 
glance into the lives and loves of 
certain lucky, creative individu-
als, and we’re fortunate enough 
to have headphones to facilitate 
our nosiness. I’m trying to hear it 
all; I need something to invigorate 
me like the coffee I’m smelling, the 
people I’m seeing. Smiling, smil-
ing, smiling.

Just as Cuomo is about to finish, 

I pause my music in a daze. Play-
ing in Espresso, I notice, is some 
ethereal troubadour singing a 
real depressing number, probably 
lamenting the loss of his Birken-
stocks — bizarre, as usual. I smile. 
And I’m given a choice: I can look 
at the walls again, notice the paint-
ings. I can start to think, and won-
der if I’ll ever find a favorite song, 
if this one is the one, if Freddie 
actually found somebody to love. 
Will I?

A big breath. My pulse starts to 

decelerate. My finger hovers above 
the keyboard. I press play. 

Or I can just listen.

Daily Arts Writer

Most instruments within the 

realm of Western classical music 
have a long and elaborate history, 
their origins veiled in a certain 
amount of mystery. Violins, flutes, 
cellos, 
oboes 

— all have long 
lines of ances-
try and plumed 
pedigrees, 
all 

have 
peda-

gogues 
and 

pedagogies. As 
a result of this 
long 
history 

and the deep-
ly 
ingrained 

traditional-
ism 
inherent 

in 
classical 

music culture, new instruments 
often have difficulty establishing 
themselves within the repertoire, 
forced to overcome the prejudices 
and obstinate attitudes of the elder 
instruments. This is certainly the 
case with the saxophone, whose 
origin — in sharp contrast to earli-
er instruments — is a clear and spe-
cific part of the historical record. 
Invented by Adolphe Sax in 1840, 
the saxophone has since become 
most famous for its prominence in 
jazz music, played virtuosi such as 
John Coltrane and Charlie Parker.

But in addition to the saxo-

phone’s 
well-known 
affiliation 

with jazz, the last several decades 
have seen the rise of saxophone in 
the classical music sphere. Solo-
ists and chamber groups of enor-
mous ability dazzle audiences 
with newly composed music for 
their instrument — and perhaps 
there is no more famous classical 
saxophone ensemble active today 
than the Prism Quartet, who will 
be performing in Ann Arbor Sat-
urday.

“The Prism Quartet formed in 

1984,” said Timothy McAllister, 
soprano saxophonist for the quar-
tet and associate professor of Saxo-
phone in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “At the time, they 
were all graduate students at the 
University of Michigan here, all 
under our great mentor, the profes-
sor emeritus of Saxophone Donald 
Sinta.”

While the quartet originally 

formed as a group of students 
seeking to advance their education 
through competition, it soon grew 
into something with a greater 
sense of purpose.

“They formed to perform locally 

and also to compete in local and 
national chamber music competi-
tions — they ended up doing really 
well, and won a few major compe-
titions, which led to a more serious 

plan and mission for the group,” 
McAllister said. “Very quickly the 
group started to get involved with 
commissioning new music — con-
temporary music by living com-
posers, namely those associated 
with the University of Michigan 
here, faculty (and) recent gradu-
ates.”

In the years following its found-

ing, Prism was a major force in the 
promotion of the saxophone as a 
serious chamber music ensemble 
rivaling the traditional string 
quartet, a heterodoxy which soon 
distinguished 
them 
from 
the 

crowd.

“The idea of the saxophone 

quartet being something out there 
that would rival the traditional 
chamber music models — I think 
that was much more a pioneering 
effort on behalf of Prism,” McAllis-
ter said. “(Because ensembles like 
the string quartet) have so much 
more history, (Prism) worked very 
quickly to make up that ground, 
just by getting today’s most impor-
tant composers to write for the 
saxophone quartet.”

Since its founding, Prism has 

had several member changes. 
McAllister himself was hired in 
2000, the third soprano saxophon-
ist to be a member of the ensemble. 
Today, the quartet is comprised 
of McAllister, Taimur Sullivan 
on baritone, Zachary Shemon on 
alto and Matthew Levy — the only 
remaining founding member — on 
tenor.

“We’ve 
always 
hired 
from 

‘Michigan aesthetic,’ which is 
quite singular, both born out of 
the playing styles of Donald Sinta 
himself and his teacher Larry 
Teal, who was the first professor of 
saxophone anywhere in the United 
States,” McAllister said. “The first 
professorship in that field start-
ed here at Michigan. We’re very 
proud of that.”

Prism has long been associated 

with the University, and in the past 
few decades has served as a model 
to saxophone students in the 
School of Music, Theater & Dance.

“I did four degrees here at 

the University of Michigan, in 
the music school, and I knew for 
myself I grew up knowing about 
the Prism quartet, I came to col-
lege here knowing its history and 
its trailblazing status,” McAllister 
said. “That was an inspiration for 
all of us who were in the (saxo-
phone) studio at the time.”

For the concert on Saturday, 

Prism will be working with several 
creative collaborators. Renowned 
jazz saxophonists Diego Rivera 
and Andrew Bishop will be join-
ing the ensemble for performances 
of “Improvisations” by Chris Pot-
ter, “Found” by Matthew Levy 

and John Coltrane’s ballad “Dear 
Lord,” arranged by Dave Liebman.

“We wanted to really collabo-

rate with some really fantastic 
local jazz musicians, because the 
program called for that,” McAl-
lister said. “The goal has been to 
show this merging of the classical 
tradition with the more academic 
jazz tradition, and basically to 
show the middle ground, to create 
a collaboration that demonstrates 
both sides of the instrument as a 
single organism.”

The program’s primary fea-

tured piece is “Improvisations” by 
Chris Potter — a legendary jazz 
saxophonist — which was com-
posed for the quartet, the concept 
being that the composer/perform-
er would join the quartet to play in 
their own piece. When the piece 
was premiered it was played by 
Prism, Potter and Ravi Coltrane, 
the son of John Coltrane. On this 
week’s program the piece will be 
performed with Rivera and Bishop.

“The whole concert is quite a 

collage of a lot of our activity. It 
showcases some of our more seri-
ous classical pieces, it showcases 
some heavy concert jazz music and 
it has some transcriptions,” McAl-
lister said. “So it’s kind of a nice 
survey of our legacy, of the kind of 
activity that we’ve embarked upon 
for the whole history of the group 
but also in the more recent history 
of the group.”

In the upcoming concert, Prism 

will also be premiering a new 
piece by William Bolcom, a Pulit-
zer prize winning composer and 
professor emeritus in Composi-
tion at the University. Bolcom’s 
work, “Schumann Bouquet,” is a 
transcription of piano music by 
the Romantic era composer Robert 
Schumann.

“We wish for no major composer 

living composer to leave this Earth 
without at least considering writ-
ing for saxophone quartet,” McAl-
lister said of the quartet’s mission. 
“And if we can have a place in get-
ting those people to write for our 
medium, great; if we can be at the 
forefront of getting their attention, 
great … but we really actively seek 
out the leading figures of our time.”

Those who attend Prism’s Sat-

urday concert will witness a broad 
collection of musical styles, as it is a 
program designed to break the oft-
found stylistic unanimity common 
in classical music concerts.

“There can be such a chame-

leon-like quality to the instru-
ment so much that from piece to 
piece, style to style, genre to genre, 
you will feel that each of those 
is genuine, and almost complete 
identifiable with the saxophone,” 
McAllister said. “And yet each 
piece will sound different.”

The narrator in Jem Cohen’s 

film “Lost Book Found” says, “as 
I became invisible, I began to see 
things that had 
once been invis-
ible 
to 
me.” 

Filming 
city 

streets 
unob-

trusively 
with 

a single camera 
and plucking his 
narratives from 
months or years 
worth of docu-
mentary 
foot-

age, Jem Cohen’s films do just that. 
His work hones in on small details, 
layering snippets of individual sto-
ries to build a distinctive portrait of 
city life.

A hybrid of documentary and 

narrative, 
Cohen’s 
films 
look 

to the landscape of cities — the 
streets, objects and debris tossed 
to the wayside — to understand 
their inhabitants. Other times, he 
separates individual people from 
the bustling crowd on the streets 
and focuses on someone walking, 
talking on the phone or simply 
standing, a poetic perspective on 
seemingly mundane daily life.

“Night Scene New York” roams 

Chinatown’s night streets. Pedes-

trians dash for cover from the rain 
in “Helianthus Corner Blues,” a 
poetic second look at an ordinary 
nuisance. Crossing the pond to 
London, “On Essex Road” is a 
watchful observation of everyday 
engagements with historic cultur-
al markers.

The “Gravity Hill Newreels” 

chronicle the Occupy Wall Street 
protests in the fall of 2011. Unlike 
news media, Cohen’s films do not 
focus exclusively on the implica-
tions of the protest, but rather take 
the time to understand the protes-
tors themselves. Organizers lead 
groups in reciting a protest mani-
festo, people crowd around tables 
lined with literature. We read 
various protest signs, see a nod of 
solidarity between strangers in the 
encampments, watch volunteers 
pass out coffee and pack supplies.

Inspired by Walter Benjamin’s 

“The Passage Clock,” the films 
overlay imagery of Parisian archi-
tecture with a narrator reading 
through the various dictionary def-
initions of “passage” for a haunting 
exploration of motion and travel, 
evolution and loss, communication 
and archive.

“Lost Book Found” reminisc-

es about a notebook wherein its 
author meticulously groups and 
chronicles spaces all over the city. 
It’s a history of New York City 

slinking through forgotten alleys 
and discount stores, using the rel-
ics of commerce to explain what 
the past was like and the direction 
it took.

Cohen’s shots are constantly 

in motion, restless with the taut 
energy that drives the people in 
them. A roving camera settles its 
eye on a subject as a smattering of 
pedestrians will dash across the 
foreground, temporarily obstruct-
ing the view. Hints of someone’s 
arm gesturing mid-conversation 
peek out from the edges of a frame. 
While Cohen pinpoints the beauty 
in individuals, it’s the public inter-
section where all their stories con-
verge that is truly mesmerizing, 
and Cohen captures the atmo-
sphere masterfully.

Yet in spite of the relentless 

movement, Cohen manages to 
pluck out the exact details needed 
to make time slow down. As view-
ers, we’re immersed into the lives 
of his subjects. We stream across 
busy sidewalks, overwhelmed with 
our own thoughts and the external 
stimuli bombarding us, but then 
we look up and catch the eye of 
someone passing us. Cohen’s work 
captures that split second of under-
standing that this is us and this is 
you, and we see each other, before 
we both whizz off into the next 
chapter of our individual lives.

What exactly does it mean to 

be a celebrity in 2016? Or, bet-
ter yet, what does it mean to 
be famous in 2016? Apparently 
nowadays, if you’re part of a 
viral video or some other Inter-
net phenomenon, you’ve already 
reached celebrity status.

Time Magazine recently put 

out a list of “The 30 Most Influ-
ential People on the Internet,” 
yet some don’t seem very influen-
tial. One particular case is that of 
Josh Holz and Daniel Lara, the 
teenagers behind one of 2016’s 
most popular memes, “Damn 
Daniel.” The two garnered Inter-
net fame after posting a collec-
tion of funny Snapchat clips on 
Twitter, in which Holz record-
ed Lara walking around while 
screaming “Damn Daniel!” and 
“Back at it again with the white 
Vans” in a strangely cartoonish 
voice. Thus, the “Damn Daniel” 
meme was born, and America ate 
it up. After the videos garnered 
extreme popularity (approxi-
mately 200 million+ retweets 
and 300 million+ likes), Holz 
and Lara made an appearance 
on “Ellen,” cameoed in Weezer’s 
“California Kids” music video, 
walked the red carpet at the 
“Allegiant” movie premiere and 
Lara earned a lifetime supply 
of white Vans. In addition to all 
that, Internet users have posted 
“Damn Daniel” trap remixes, 
created “Damn Daniel” tattoos 
and so forth. 

While the titular star of 

“Damn Daniel” did use his 
stardom wisely (he donated 
the lifetime supply of Vans to 

a children’s hospital), it’s kind 
of funny to think that someone 
can become famous simply by 
having a pair of shoes, a camera 
phone and a Twitter account. 
That being said, the past few 
years have shown that viral vid-
eos and social media have been 
the major catalysts for trans-
forming ordinary people into 
online superstars. Last year, for 
instance, “Alex from Target” 
took the Internet by storm when 
a picture of an attractive Target 
cashier went viral. As I men-
tioned in one of my first articles 
for The Michigan Daily, the vid-
eo-sharing app Vine is a perfect 
example of this. With its six-sec-
ond limit, Vine allows users to 
capture hilarious, spontaneous 
moments and creative, impro-
visational clips. Though Vine 
can be beneficial in showcas-
ing the talent of aspiring young 
actors and highlighting other 
realms of pop culture, it’s also 
a way in which companies can 
capitalize on the fame of popu-
lar Viners and make them into 
corporate sellouts. Numerous 
“Vine famous” stars also take 
advantage of their online celeb-
rity by coming together in highly 
populated areas for “Vine meet-
ups” to sign autographs and take 
pictures with fans.

The reason why this troubles 

and intrigues me so much is that 
fame, especially Internet fame, 
is a tricky double-edged sword. 
While it can be a great platform 
for helping raise awareness on a 
social cause or giving back to the 
community, it can also lead to 
media scrutiny, TMZ paparazzi 
and second-rate imitators. The 
way in which people yearn to 

be as close to the limelight as 
possible is perhaps an even big-
ger reason as to why people on 
social media become “famous.”

I witnessed this type of obses-

sion with instant celebrity in 
high school. In the spring of 
2013, I watched a senior from 
my high school, Jake Davidson, 
become an overnight sensation 
when he starred in a viral video 
titled “Kate Upton, Will You Go 
to Prom with Me?” I can recall 
spending half of my first period 
biology class huddled around a 
computer with other students 
to intently watch a KTLA pro-
file interview on Jake. He was 
also featured on CNN, Yahoo 
and Ryan Seacrest’s radio show. 
Other students at my high 
school would jokingly take pic-
tures with Jake and share it 
on social media to show off to 
their friends that they “met” the 
“Kate Upton guy.”

During that time, I remem-

ber thinking how amazing and 
insane it was that someone from 
my high school could become 
that famous instantly. But like 
most Internet “celebrities,” fame 
comes and goes. Months from 
now, “Damn Daniel” will be a 
fading memory, relived only for 
nostalgic purposes. Yet, most 
of all, there seems to be one big 
change when it comes to achiev-
ing American fame: fame used to 
be perceived as this ideal way of 
living that was only within the 
reach of actors, musicians, ath-
letes and entrepreneurs. Now, in 
an era of virality and expanding 
media outlets, it seems as though 
becoming a celebrity can be as 
simple as a click of a button or 
the tap of a touchscreen.

EPISODE REVIEW

Since the beginning of CW’s 

excellent first season of the 
musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girl-
friend,” we have watched pro-
tagonist 
Rebecca 
Bunch 
(Rachel 
Bloom, 
“Robot 
Chicken”) 
develop 
from a 
delusional, 
depressed New York lawyer into 
a sunny, self-aware California 
woman. In this week’s episode 
“Josh Has No Idea Where I Am!,” 
the show focuses on the interplay 
between Rebecca and her friends, 
where Rebecca’s doubts about 
her ability to maintain loving 
relationships are literally mani-
fested in a hysterical yet poignant 
dream sequence.

After last week’s cliffhanger 

— Rebecca leaves on a plane and 
is seated next to her therapist 
Dr. Akopian (Michael Hyatt, 
“Nightcrawler”) — it’s quickly 
revealed that Rebecca is in fact 
not on her way to Hawaii to be 
with Josh, but back to New York 
City in hopes of getting her job 
and old life back. Disillusioned by 
Josh’s rejection of her, Rebecca 
has lost all hope in justifying why 

she moved to West Covina in the 
first place. But after falling asleep 
from ingesting a huge amount of 
sleeping pills and a Bloody Mary, 
Rebecca finds some insight from 
her subconscious, portrayed by 
Dr. Akopian. Together, the two 
women look through Rebecca’s 
memories of her childhood and 
college years to examine her 
relationship with her estranged 
father and a fling with a preten-
tious theatre major.

By contrasting the memories 

with her current life, Dr. Ako-
pian shows Rebecca that she in 
fact has people in her life who 
care about her well-being. Grad-
ually, Rebecca realizes those 
people are her best work friend 
Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin, 
“The Good Wife”), her boss Dar-
ryl (Pete Gardner, “The Brink”), 
her cynical on-and-off again 
love interest Greg (Santino Fon-

tana, “Frozen”) and her summer 
camp crush Josh Chan (Vincent 
Rodriguez III, “Hostages”).

Like many of “Crazy Ex-

Girlfriend” ’s episodes, “Josh 
Has No Idea Where I Am!” 
works on all levels, from Bloom 
and Aline Brosh McKenna’s 
incredible writing to Steven 
Tsuchida’s sensitive direction 
to the typically fantastic act-
ing of the ensemble cast. The 
episode’s only musical number, 
“Dream Ghost,” is a riveting 
treat as well, with Hyatt singing 
alongside welcome guest stars 
Amber Riley (“Glee”) and Nicki 
Lake (“Hairspray”). Its deft bal-
ance between sincere drama 
and witty comedy only furthers 
the story’s progression and the 
show’s status as one of the best 
and most underrated TV pro-
grams in the 2015-16 season.

GILLIAN 

JAKAB

By JOEY SCHUMAN

For the Daily

Yung Lean is wack to the 

fullest extent. Wack enough, 
apparently, to have his tour bus 
shot at, which happened Mar. 18 
after a Pittsburgh show. Scary, 
yes, but more than anything this 
shooting seemed to signal to the 
music world that the 19-year-old 
was somehow still relevant after 
two studio album releases that 
ranged from shaky (Unknown 
Memory) to flat out questionable 
(Warlord). 
Much 
has 
been 

written about the enigmatic 
19-year old Swede; Lean (real 
name: Jonatan Aron Leandoer 
Håstad) initially unearthed a 
hotbed of rap fandom through his 
use of early to mid-2000s cultural 
references and proved sneakily 
introspective while spitting out 
lines that scream in the language 
of phony — on “Kyoto,” off of 
Lavender EP (2013), he claims, “I 
got an empire of emotional squad 
/ see me cruisin,’ cruisin,’ in my 
go kart / I’m War ho, I’m Warhol 
/ I’m Wario when I’m in Mario 
Kart.”

The first time I heard Yung 

Lean was, appropriately, during 
my December 2013 trip to Israel. 
My first thought was that it 

was kind of funny. My second 
thought was questioning why I 
was listening to a 17-year-old rap 
about getting his balls licked by a 
Zooey Deschanel lookalike. My 
final thought was questioning 
why I was listening to this 
adolescent rap about getting his 
balls licked by a Zooey Deschanel 
lookalike while I was in a car ride 
from Masada to Jerusalem. My 
scenery consisted of beautiful, 
pure landscapes en route to 
arguably the world’s holiest city, 
and nothing about life at that 
moment felt kosher. Listening 
to “Ginseng Strip 2002” felt so 
wrong, yet so right, and I loved 
it. It was then that I understood 
the true essence of Yung Lean; he 
was the best type of joke.

What initially cultivated his 

brand was his expert tiptoeing 
of the line between innovation 
and idiocy. He started a bucket 
hat-wearing, 
probably 
not 

lean-consuming cult by taking 
what other rappers didn’t take 
seriously and making it his own. 
There wasn’t much substance 
in his raps, but his absurdity, 
heavily complemented by fairly 
unpredictable 
production 

from buds Yung Gud and Yung 
Sherman, presented a different, 
totally welcome total rap package.

Everything since then has 

been, for lack of a better word, 
confusing. He’s started taking 
himself more seriously, which 
is probably a good thing for his 
natural 
human 
development, 

but definitely a bad thing for his 
career prospects.

When he put out Warlord in 

February, I finished listening to it 
in a state of disarray. On “Hoover” 
he quipped, “Wake up with some 
liquor in me / wake up, and the 
world is empty / wake up, bet my 
bag is empty / wake up, take a trip 
to Paris.” What came out of this 
album was just dread — I wasn’t 
expecting a Justin Bieber-esque 
character shift for the worse, I 
didn’t want such dark, trappy 
production and I definitely wasn’t 
comfortable with a seemingly 
alcoholic Yung Lean.

If the young rapper wants 

to maintain his unique spot in 
hip hop, the most sensible move 
would be to halt such a transition. 
Yung Lean is fun, but he’s most 
fun when he’s making the type 
of “meme rap” that people don’t 
really need to take seriously. 
The current climate of the genre 
allows room for something like 
this, and hopefully he provides it. 
There’ll continue to be quite a few 
“sadboys” alongside me if not.

Bummer Yung Lean

Dear Gillian,
This past Friday I went to a bar 

with some friends. When we finally 
escaped the line outside and entered 
this underground space, I imme-
diately 
headed to 
the bar for 
a 
drink. 

It 
was 

there that 
I saw him. 
Brown 
silky 
hair 

and green 
eyes. I was 
instantly 
mesmer-
ized 
by 

this complete stranger. I spent the 
entire night trying to come up with a 
line or something to say to him, but 
at the end of the night I went home 
without even speaking to this man. 
This is why I am writing to you. I 
have never been good at approaching 
people at bars. The idea of rejection 
terrifies me; maybe he already has a 
partner, maybe he has no intention 
of speaking to strangers at a public 
bar or maybe he too wanted to speak 
to me, but was just as nervous. As I 
headed home, I thought that if I was 
perhaps in a class with this man or if 
he was attending a house party that 
I was at, I would have approached 
him. Something about being at a bar 
and talking to stranger has always 
intimidated me. How can I over-
come this fear of rejection?

 – Lust at First Sight
Dear Lust,
From the tabernae along the 

Appian Way to Beowulf’s Mead 
Hall to the Mos Eisley Cantina 
of Star Wars, bars have always 
served as places of edgy, vaguely 
dangerous adventure. Whether 
they lead to anything or not, there’s 
an excitement to encounters with 
the unintroduced. Though not 
everyone you approach will be 
available or interested, neither 
will anyone judge you for testing 
the waters and sussing out your 
stranger.

Unlike your counterexamples 

from class or a house party, 
encounters at a bar are based 
on having very little in common 
besides what’s assumed by venue 
choice. The crowd at Aut Bar is way 
different from that at Skeeps, and 
both are different from that at Rush 
Street. Then again, we’ve been to 
them all; the smaller the city, the 
less niche-y its spots can afford to 
be. At a house party, you have the 
hosts in common, or at least run into 
the same groups of friends; in class, 
you share an intellectual interest or 
at least a desire to pass. Bar patrons 
can be anyone from anywhere, and 
connections tend toward the lowest 
common denominator. (The fact 
that those might be too low for your 

instincts, Lust, is not a bad thing.) 
For these reasons, bars as pick-up 
spots tend to conjure images of 
uncertainty, romantic emptiness 
or even sleaze.

So why do you keep regarding 

bars 
as 
places 
of 
romantic 

potential? Jay McInerney sums up 
the paradox in his novel “Bright 
Lights, Big City”: “The problem is, 
for some reason you think you are 
going to meet the kind of girl who 
is not the kind of girl who would 
be at a place like this at this time of 
the morning.” 

Depending on the vibe of your 

spot, though, it may be a really 
nice place for some flirtatious 
chat. Then comes your next 
problem: a dearth of information. 
Is he interested in your gender? Is 
he interested in you? Is he single? 
Does he remember last week when 
you made eye contact at the other 
end of the bar? Look at Archibald 
Motley Jr.’s painting “Nightlife.” 
Documenting the Black social life 
of Bronzeville, Chicago’s South 
Side community, the background 
of the painting is injected with 
the exuberance and rhythm of 
the jazz age. In the foreground 
Motley captures the disjointed 
and thorny drama of the scene: a 
man at the bar can summon only 
enough courage to get his upper 
body to beckon, his hips and feet 
still unmoved facing the bar. This 
hesitancy results in an ambiguous 
gesture that leaves the three 
women confused about who he 
wants — one who’s taken, one who 
wants him and one who hasn’t 
even noticed.

Now, Lust, in case you want 

some, the liberal arts offer some 
clever pick-up lines and here are 
several examples:

Sylvia Plath: “Kiss me and you’ll 

see how important I am.”

Patti Smith: “Will you pretend 

you’re my boyfriend?”

Pablo Neruda: “I’d like to do 

with you what Spring does with 
the cherry tree.”

Gary 
Shteyngart: 
“I’m 
the 

fortieth ugliest man in this bar. 
But so what! … Isn’t this how 
people used to fall in love?

F. Scott Fitzgerald: “I like large 

parties. They’re so intimate. At 
small parties, there’s no privacy.”

That reminds me: I’ve been 

meaning to warn you against 
adopting Gatsby’s game. Don’t rent 
out The Last Word, publicize it 
robustly and arrange the invite of 
your green-eyed hottie. Things go 
terribly wrong if you try to deploy 
contrivance 
after 
contrivance 

to draw your Daisy close. So 
even if you’ve taken a trip to the 
bathroom for a quick Facebook 
stalk after catching a glimpse of 
his signature as he closed out his 
tab, resist the urge to name-drop 

that mutual friend of yours or ask 
how he enjoyed last semester in 
Copenhagen.

You write of the moment when 

you were instantly mesmerized, 
Lust. There’s nothing that takes 
you out of the mundane like the 
non-verbal communication of a 
stranger’s gaze. For Baudelaire, 
this was at the heart of the 
experience of the modern city. You 
might give a read to his poem, “To 
a Passerby,” a meditation on the 
anonymous figure who walks into 
your life and right on by. While 
it’s great fodder for poetry, I’d 
suggest avoiding the fixation of a 
voyeuristic flâneur; it’ll be creepy. 
Let that moment stir you, but stop 
staring.

I’m assuming you’re not at this 

bar alone. Friends (his, yours) can 
help reduce the fear of rejection. 
It’s best, though, to avoid any overt 
competition or goofiness like the 
sailors on shore leave in Jerome 
Robbins’s ballet “Fancy Free.” 
The sailors don’t know what to 
do with their sea legs in the big 
city filled with beautiful broads. 
They fumble over each other (with 
exquisite choreography) for the 
poor gals’ attention.

If after all this you still want 

to get better at approaching guys 
in bars, you might watch Diane 
Keaton in the 1977 film “Looking 
For Mr. Goodbar,” based on the 
Judith Rossner novel of the same 
name. Her character seems to 
have no problem night after night. 
But it ends horribly.

I don’t know if this is the advice 

you want, Lust, but I believe your 
intimidation about approaching 
strangers at bars is healthy and 
noble. No matter how fine these 
strangers may be, hitting on them 
in that milieu is not naturally your 
thing, and there’s nothing wrong 
with that. I’d keep my ears alert 
and listen for an invitation to 
join the conversation, head to the 
dance floor or make come-hither 
eye contact. If nothing of the sort 
presents itself, all is not lost. When 
you get out of the bar, you can drop 
your intimidation like a bad Econ 
course and not rest until you find 
a way to meet this young man in a 
context that suits your style.

How do I talk to sexy

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

THE CW

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

On Saturday and Sunday at 7 

p.m., the Walgreen Drama Center 
on North Campus will transform 
into a diverse 
performance 
space. Walking 
room to room, 
audiences will 
move between 
the worlds of 
Shakespeare 
and 
Greek 

tragedy, 
experiencing 
dance 
performance, 
musical 
theatre 
and 

the 
original 

works of University of Michigan 
students.

The 
Wall-to-Wall 
Theatre 

Festival is three years old and 
producer, 
director 
and 
LSA 

graduate 
Clare 
Brennan 
has 

been involved since its inception. 
According to her, the festival 
serves as an opportunity for 
students to see a variety of 
different genres of theatre in one 
night.

“We have nine pieces, all being 

performed in different spaces in 
the Walgreen Drama Center,” 
Brennan said. “They’ll be in the 
lobby, they’ll be in classrooms, 
some pieces will be in hallways or 
in small practice rooms. Audiences 
show up at 7 p.m. and they can go 
to any of these nine pieces, and 
then see another show after the 
piece is done. So you can see five 
or six shows over the course of the 
night.”

Brennan’s piece is an original 

work, an amalgamation of 10 
of Shakespeare’s sonnets. She 
and her cast wove the sonnets 
together and created a storyline 
that links them, a romance that 
falls apart. Film work and other 
media are incorporated into the 
live performance as well.

Producer and School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance senior Allyssa 
Powell has also been involved in 
the festival since its beginning. 
Powell said the idea for the festival 
originally came from School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance graduate 

Neal Kelley.

“It started as kind of a passion 

project, and we involved people 
who had something they’ve been 
dying to perform,” she said. “It’s 
a very unique experience, and it’s 
one of a kind on this campus. It’s 
really cool to walk in the door and 
not know what to expect.”

Something that makes Wall-to-

Wall unique among on-campus 
theatre productions is the concept 
of “roaming theatre.” The nine, 
25-minute 
acts 
perform 
in 

different parts of the Walgreen 
Center and audiences roam the 
building, moving from act to 
act. School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance junior Leia Squillace, 
whose piece will be formed 
on the grand staircase in the 
lobby of the Walgreen Center, 
called the festival “site-specific,” 
emphasizing 
the 
importance 

of the diversity of performance 
spaces to this event.

“Wall-to-Wall really breathes 

this air of experimentation,” 
she said. “You’re forced to be 
experimental because you’re not 
in a conventional space. You have 
to figure out how to use that space 
to your advantage, and I think the 
shows that are the most successful 
are the ones that embrace that 
space for what it is, as opposed to 
trying to navigate around it.”

Squillace is involved in Wall-

to-Wall for the first time this 
year. She is directing a 25-minute 
condensed version of “Trojan 
Women,” 
a 
Greek 
tragedy 

originally written by Euripides 
and 
translated 
into 
modern 

English by Ellen McLaughlin. 
This translation was created in 
collaboration with a group of 
female refugees from the Bosnian 
War, and Squillace said the 
themes of community and how 
communities support each other 
through tragedy are important to 
her piece.

School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance junior Larissa Marten 
also emphasized the opportunity 
for 
experimentation 
afforded 

by Wall-to-Wall. Marten will be 
performing a 25-minute excerpt 
from an original one-woman 
show called “I Killed the Cow,” 
which she has been working on 
for six months.

“Each night you get to do your 

show four or five times, so you 
get really great feedback on what 
sections work, what part of your 
writing lands, what part of your 
writing doesn’t land,” she said. “So 
it’s great from my perspective as 
a workshop learning experience 
because you get to do your show 
so many times after another. And 
because the sections are so short, 
I feel like, especially for students, 
it’s a really great opportunity 
to create work, because it’s not 
that big pressure of ‘Oh, I have 
to create a full length show,’ and 
that’s why I think students really 
flourish.”

Marten said her piece will 

involve a large amount of audience 
participation. She aims to get her 
audience to think and talk about 
their memories of sex and to “take 
sex out of the dark.”

“The piece I’m performing 

is called ‘Lost, Shared, Taken,’ 
” Marten said. “It’s centered 
around the idea that, today, sex 
is not talked about enough for 
people to really feel comfortable. 
It’s the idea of how we become the 
sexual beings that we are.”

Other performances include 

“Good Intentions,” a satirical 
work directed by School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance sophomore 
Sam 
Hamashima 
and 
“By 

Candlelight,” a performance by 
student dance group Sitelines, 
directed by School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance junior Ellen 
Wallace. 
This 
diversity 
of 

performances, 
Squillace 
said, 

allows the festival to make theatre 
accessible to everyone.

“For people who don’t like 

theatre 
or 
aren’t 
typically 

exposed, I just think it’s the most 
genius idea,” she said. “One, it’s 
free, so no consequences. Two, 
you can stay as long or as short as 
you want.”

Powell agreed that Wall-to-

Wall has a unique ability to share 
new pieces and kinds of theatre, 
even to theatre junkies.

“It’s another way of arts 

education and instilling the arts 
in people’s lives, because that is 
often not the case,” she said. “It’s 
exposure to art forms you’ve 
never heard of, but also stretching 
the idea of what theatre can be.”
