During 
a 
community 

conversation on race and campus 
climate 
Sunday, 
University 

of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel listened to student 
concerns and emphasized the 
impact he hopes the upcoming 
release of a University-wide 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan will have on campus.

The conversation, announced 

on Wednesday, was planned 
in response to racially charged 
fliers that were hung in Mason 
and Haven Halls last week. 
The fliers, along with a planned 
debate over the merits of the 
Black Lives Matter movement, 

prompted large student protests 
throughout the week.

Both 
events 
occurred 
a 

week before the release of the 
University’s 
Diversity, 
Equity 

and Inclusion strategic plan, a 
year-long 
initiative 
launched 

by Schlissel last September and 
slated to be announced Thursday.

Schlissel told the crowd that 

he believes the success of his 
presidency rests on the execution 
of the plan, and his ability to 
improve climate on campus.

He also stressed the need to 

get students involved in resolving 
campus climate issues, noting 
low attendance at events.

Four forums held by LSA 

over the past few weeks about 
their portion of the strategic 

Cecilia Muñoz, director of the 

White House Domestic Policy 
Council, and a panel of experts 
from Rust Belt cities in the U.S. 
drew more than 100 attendees to 
explore the crucial relationships 
between municipal, state and 
national governments for the 
implementation of the Obama 
administration’s 
“place-based” 

approach to domestic policy.

Muñoz, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan alum, was also the 
Towsley Foundation Policymaker 

in Residence at the Public Policy 
School in 2007.

The panel was comprised of five 

public servants from the Rust Belt 
cities of Youngstown, Ohio; Gary, 
Ind.; and Detroit, each highlighting 
the 
role 
of 
cooperation 
on 

municipal, state and national levels 
in the “place-based”approach the 
Obama administration has taken 
to domestic policy. Rust Belt cities 
refer to Midwestern and northern 
American 
cities 
characterized 

by declining industry and falling 
populations.

Colonel 
Kevin

the 

commander’s

for community partnerships in 

Youngstown and former United 
States Air Force Commander,

and 
blight 

remediation superintendent for 
the city of Youngstown, described 
the 
city’s 
unique 
cooperative 

relationship 
in 
tackling 
the 

problem of abandoned or vacant 
housing. Looking for ways to cut 
down on training costs for the 
Youngstown Air Reserve Station, 
Riley made use of the Realistic 
Military Training Program to kill

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Gov. Rick Snyder (R) speaks at the Let’s End Campus Sexual Assault Summit at the North Campus Research Complex Friday.

Michigan 
first 
lady 
Sue 

Snyder hosted the second annual 
“Inform. Empower. Prevent. Let’s 
End Campus Sexual Assault” 
summit Friday at the University of 

Michigan where representatives 
from Greek life, athletics and 
state 
government 
discussed 

rising sexual assault numbers and 
strategies for eliminating sexual 
assault on college campuses.

The summit featured a variety 

of speakers and panels, including 
an athletic panel as well as panels 
on bystander intervention and 

rape culture.

Gov. Rick Snyder, first lady Sue 

Snyder and their daughter, LSA 
junior Kelsey Snyder, kicked off 
the event with remarks on the 
importance of creating a dialogue 
on sexual assault and working 
to end sexual assault on college 
campuses.

In his remarks, Gov. Snyder said 

sexual assault has historically been 
one of the most underrepresented 
issues in society, and legislatures 
and colleges need to be doing more 
to combat it. He said summits 
like this one are a powerful step 
forward, but also encouraged 
people to go out and take action to 
individually facilitate change.

The first top-10 matchup in Ann 

Arbor since 2003 was expected 
to be a defensive showdown, and 
with the sun setting over Michigan 
Stadium in the fourth quarter, it 
looked like a showdown in which 
the 
fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 

might come up short.

Despite 
outgaining 
No. 
8 

Wisconsin by nearly 200 yards, 
Michigan had struggled to get 
anything going after scoring a 
touchdown on the first play of the 
second quarter. The Badgers had 
stopped every drive, sacked and 
picked off redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight and 
capitalized on three missed field 
goals to put the Wolverines’ backs 
against the wall.

But Speight reached back for one 

big play — a 46-yard touchdown 
pass to fifth-year senior wide 
receiver Amara Darboh with 7:56 
to play — and it put Michigan back 
on top, 14-7. And as it has all season, 
the Wolverines’ defense took care 
of the rest.

During the Michigan vs. 

Wisconsin game, 19-year-old 

actress Chloe Grace Moretz, 

known for her roles in the 

films like “Kick-Ass,” joined 

the College Democrats to 

rally University of Michigan 

students to vote for Democratic 

presidential nominee Hillary 

Clinton.

According to AmericaJr, a 

news and entertainment website, 

about 250 students registered at 

the event.

“It’s really exciting … to talk 

to a bunch of 18- and 19-year-old 

kids who have never registered 

to vote yet and this is their first 

vote — as with me, this is my 

very first vote; it’s exciting,” 

Moretz said in an interview with 

AmericaJr. “I think what’s sad 

is that the other side of this aisle 

has made this election process 

really negative. … The whole 

entire electoral process should 

be fun and exciting and you 

should have positive experience 

with your friends and learn 

things from both sides.”

LSA senior Taiwo Dosunmu, 

the communications director 

for the University’s chapter of 

College Democrats, said the 

event was handled by Clinton’s 

campaign campus organizers, 

but College Democrats promoted 

the event to its members.

“I attended the event and 

thought it went very well,” he 

said. “She spoke briefly about 

the importance of registering 

our fellow students to vote and 

did a good job conveying her 

enthusiasm about this election 

and about Hillary Clinton.”

Moretz has also been 

campaigning for Clinton 

this week at other Michigan 

universities such as Lawrence 

Tech University in Southfield 

and Michigan State University.

According to an interview 

with People magazine, Moretz 

decided to support Clinton after 

viewing her college loan reform 

plan. Clinton’s plan allows 

families who are earning under 

$125,000 per year enroll their 

children in an in-state university 

with a promise of being debt-free 

after graduation.

“This is a great opportunity, 

but let’s not have this opportunity 
just be a nice meeting — that’s 
not the point of today,” Snyder 
said. “The charge I would give 
you — the challenge I would say 
to you — is come out of here with 
a passion to inform others, to 
be that role model to empower 
others.”

At last year’s summit, Gov. 

Snyder 
first 
announced 
the 

introduction 
of 
a 
$500,000 

grant, which could be used by 
universities to apply for funding 
for sexual assault prevention 
initiatives. 
The 
University 

received $20,003, which it used 
for the Raise the Bar program 
— an initiative in which local 
bar employees participated in 
bystander intervention training. 
On Sunday, Snyder said he is 
proud the state is allocating 
another $500,000 for the same 
purpose. The University plans to 
apply for the grant again, but has 
not yet decided on a project for 
the potential funding.

Snyder, a University alum, said 

the college campus experience 
is an exceptional part of a young 
person’s life and development, 
and that people on campuses 
across the state need to be 
interacting with and educating 
students about sexual assault 
prevention.

“That’s one of the greatest 

experiences many of us have 
had in our lives, the opportunity 
to go on campus, to have that 
first experience beyond home,” 
Snyder said. “We need to engage 
everyone in this dialogue so 
these young people can have 
that wonderful experience we all 
dream about and not have these 
terrible tragedies interfere with 
their lives, potentially ruin their 
lives.”

Sue Snyder said the issue 

is important to her, especially 
because her daughter Kelsey is 
a student at the University and 
she considers Ann Arbor her 
hometown.

“That makes the work we 

are doing here today especially 
meaningful,” she said. “That’s 
what 
makes 
this 
initiative 

so personal: Our college and 
university campuses are our 
students’ 
homes 
away 
from 

home.”

Changing 
the 
culture 

surrounding sexual assault and 
encouraging students to seek 
help is a primary concern for 
her, Sue Snyder said. She said it is 
unacceptable for colleges to have 
an atmosphere that doesn’t give 
the proper respect to survivors 
and makes students afraid to 
speak up about sexual assault.

“Sexual assault has been a 

taboo topic around the country 
for far too long, and I am so proud 
Michigan is a leader in addressing 
this issue,” Snyder said.

Currently, the University of 

Michigan, Grand Valley State 
University and Alma College 
are 
under 
investigation 
for 

Title IX violations. Michigan 
State University was also under 
investigation for two cases, but 
both were resolved in 2015.

In a press conference after 

the event, Gov. Snyder said it 
is expected that sexual assault 
statistics will rise as more people 
feel 
comfortable 
reporting 

incidents, but the end goal is 
to see a decrease as assault 
prevention techniques are more 
effective.

“The goal is to reduce it over 

time,” he said. “Obviously you 
can see the numbers increase as 

you get awareness, but then 
hopefully prevention starts 
kicking in and you see that 
number go down.”

Speaking 
to 
the 

University 
specifically, 

Kelsey Snyder said unity 
and transparency between 
different 
organizations 

such as the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness 
Center, 
Central 
Student 

Government and Greek life 
are key.

“(From) 
firsthand 

experience, 
transparency 

is one of the biggest things 
a college campus can have 
with the community,” she 
said. “Just knowing the 
exact steps to take, having 
it all laid out, so (students) 
don’t 
feel 
blindsided 
by 

anything.”

New to this year’s summit 

was 
a 
forum 
for 
input 

from high school students, 
student athletes and Greek 
life representatives.

plan had notably low attendance, 
averaging about 40 people each 
except for one for staff, which drew 
120. Sunday’s gathering had one of 
the highest reported attendances 
for a University-sponsored event 
regarding diversity on campus this 
past month, with over 180 people.

However, student attendance has 

been much higher at student-run 
events, such as protests Monday and 
Tuesday night that drew more than 
600 people.

During the forum, Schlissel 

asked how University can engage 
better with students, asking for 

input from the audience.

“Where are the majority of 

students on the campus, and what 
more will it take to get everyone 
involved, woken up and care about 
this issue?” Schlissel said. “Just 
having this group here talk, it does 
us good, but we are not reaching 
enough people.”

E. Royster Harper, vice president 

for student life, also said she wished 
more students had attended the 
LSA diversity forums and other 
University-sponsored events, and 
highlighted the importance of 
bringing everyone together into one 
space to address issues of diversity 
on campus.

“Look at our community: We are 

together, we are talking,” she said. 

“We are not perfect, but we sure are 
trying.”

Speaking directly to the posters, 

Schlissel 
reiterated 
several 
of 

the sentiments in the campus-
wide email he sent Wednesday, 
saying while the administration is 
investigating who was responsible 
for the posters, it may never find the 
party responsible.

The event was split into three 

parts: small group conversations, 
group summary discussions and 
lastly, a speakout where students 
were given two minutes to share 
their opinions about the recent 
events on campus.

interception by senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis with two minutes 
remaining 
— 
allowing 
the 

Wolverines to hang on for the 
victory, their first win over a top-10 
opponent since upsetting the then-
ninth-ranked Badgers in 2008.

“I thought our secondary was 

really good (and) our defensive 
line was lights out,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “It was a 
game ball for (defensive coordinator) 
Don Brown kind of a game. Very 
impressed with our defense, with 
our defensive coaches and with the 
character of our defensive players 
and their talent. A-plus-plus.”

The game was back-and-forth 

from the start, beginning with three 
straight three-and-outs before the 
Wolverines got on the board first on 
an 11-play, 77-yard drive that started 
near the end of the first quarter. 
It was highlighted by a bizarre 
sequence where Michigan’s offense 
re-defined the term “I-formation” 
by lining up in a 10-man straight 
line under center on the last play 
of the first quarter. (They call the 
formation “Train,” Harbaugh later 
said.)

The Wolverines readjusted right 

before the snap, with senior running 
back De’Veon Smith taking the 
handoff and pushing the pile to the 

1-yard line. Redshirt junior fullback 
Khalid Hill punched it into the end 
zone for his fifth touchdown of 
the season on the next play, giving 
Michigan a 7-0 lead.

After 
that, 
Speight 
found 

himself under constant pressure, 
narrowly avoiding multiple sacks 
and throwing a near-interception 
to safety Luben Figaro in the 
second quarter. That karma would 
eventually catch up to Speight, as he 
was picked off by cornerback Derrick 
Tindal in the third quarter to give 
the Badgers the ball in Michigan 
territory. They quickly capitalized, 
with Hornibrook finding running 
back Dare Ogunbowale on a 17-yard 
wheel route for a game-tying 
touchdown.

Harbaugh absolved Speight of 

the blame for both of those throws, 
though, saying the quarterback’s 
only real mistake came when he took 
a sack in the third quarter instead of 
throwing the ball away.

“He was making good decisions,” 

Harbaugh said. “I don’t know how 
many decisions that is in a game, 
but if you make one bad one, (you’re) 
probably in the high 90s, percentage-
wise.”

The Wolverines had numerous 

chances to seize momentum earlier 
in the game, but they allowed kicking 
troubles and untimely penalties to 
stop them cold. Fifth-year senior 
kicker Kenny Allen missed both a 31- 
and 43-yard field goal in the first half, 
and sophomore Ryan Tice missed a 

40-yarder when he took over for an 
attempt in the third quarter.

Michigan also took a number of 

key penalties on punt formations, 
and it wasted prime field position 
late in the first half when it recorded 
both an illegal motion penalty and 
offensive pass interference on a 
deep pass to fifth-year senior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson.

The Wolverines managed to 

keep the game tied until the fourth 
quarter, though, and ultimately 
outgained the Badgers, 349-159. It 
also benefited from a stellar game 
from senior cornerback Channing 
Stribling, who had two interceptions 
and two pass breakups.

Thanks to the defense’s steadiness 

and the offense’s sudden resurgence, 
Michigan now has a signature win 
under its belt after four straight 
blowouts.

“Any time you can beat a top-10 

team and kind of let the world know 
that we’ve got something going on 
here … it’s special,” said redshirt 
junior running back Ty Isaac. “It’s 
not like fluke stuff.”

Injury update: The Wolverines 

lost sophomore left tackle Grant 
Newsome to an apparent knee injury 
in the second quarter. Newsome 
waved off the cart and walked to the 
locker room with the help of trainers, 
but Harbaugh said he would likely 
require an unspecified “surgical 
procedure.” Redshirt sophomore 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty replaced 
him at left tackle.

(the city) have a need where they 
have excess houses that need to 
come down, so we were able to get 
a memorandum of understanding 
signed,”he said. “It required the 
city to go through quite a few legal 
hoops to get there, including passing 
some ordinances to allow us to work 
on their equipment. They would 
provide all the supervision, all of 
the equipment, I would provide the 
labor and my guys get valuable stick 
time.”

Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson 

of Gary, Ind., described a similar 
collaboration in her city when the 
federal government was able to 
stretch federal dollars in dealing 
with urban blight and crime, despite 
low initial confidence. Using data 
acquired 
through 
cooperation 

with the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development and other 
federal agencies, Freeman-Wilson 
said she was able to quantify the 
housing vacancy problem more 
accurately and spend the limited 
federal funding in the most useful 
way.

“Shortly after taking office in 

January 2012, I got a visit from 
our regional HUD secretary, and 
he said, ‘I’m from the federal 
government and I’m here to help.’ 
And I’m thinking, ‘OK, I’ll entertain 
him for maybe 30 or 60 days and 
send him on his way,’ ” she said. “But 
I’m humbled to say that it really did 
transform into a wonderful working 
relationship.”

Augusta Gudeman, a first-year 

master’s student in the Ford School 
of Public Policy and the Taubman 
College of Architecture and Urban 
Planning, said she came to the panel 
because she thought the problem of 
urban blight was highly relevant.

“I think it’s something that 

we’re going to see around the U.S. 
probably more often, and it’s just 
a really interesting case study, so I 
was interested in what the leaders 
had to say,”Gudeman said. “I wasn’t 
familiar with anyone who was 
on the panel before coming, but 
learning about the federal and local 
level partnerships was awesome.”

Describing the city of Gary’s 

high murder rate, Freeman-Wilson 
said that the problem was also 
resolved 
through 
collaborating 

with the federal government. After 
Freeman-Wilson wrote a letter to 
then-Attorney General Eric Holder 
requesting 
help, 
Gary 
became 

one of the first cities involved in 
the Department of Justice Office 
of Justice Programs Diagnostic 
Center.

“I’m telling you, I have never had 

an experience as a guinea pig be so 
positive,” she said. “Our murder 
rate is half of what it was this time 
last year, and I’m genuinely afraid 
to say that publicly because you 
never know what will happen, but 
what I can say is that in changing 
the 
strategy 
and 
getting 
the 

collaboration 
with 
the 
federal 

government, it has caused not just 
the local government to come to the 
table, but the county government, 
the state government and private 
foundations.”

Freeman-Wilson also said one of 

the biggest hurdles in cooperation 

with the federal government is 
public distrust.

“The complication is the attitude 

that local residents have,” she said. 
“When we say that we’re part of the 
Strong Cities, Strong Communities 
initiative, they’re looking for the big 
check. And when I say ‘Oh, no, no, 
there’s no check,’ they’re looking 
like someone pulled the wool over 
my eyes.”

Muñoz agreed, citing public 

distrust as one of the Obama 
administration’s chief concerns.

“The thing that the president 

fears the most is cynicism,” she 
said. “This notion that things are 
just broken, and that we can’t 
make these neighborhoods places 
of 
opportunity 
anymore. 
He 

believes that’s wrong, and we have 
evidence that it’s wrong, and that 
there is brilliant local leadership 
and great innovation that people 
in this country remain capable 
of. This isn’t so much about the 
individual 
programs. 
It’s 
very 

much about the spirit in which the 
federal 
government 
approaches 

its 
partnerships 
with 
local 

communities.”

First-year Public Health student 

Camille Maker said she appreciated 
the panel’s tone of cooperation.

“I really enjoyed the emphasis on 

realizing that you can collaborate 
together, and it’s not something 
that you would come towards 
thought for change from one single 
direction, or from federal to state 
level, from state level to community, 
but that you can all impact every 
single level between them and you 
can all separately impact thought 
for change,” she said.

PANEL
From Page 1A

“definitely yes” or “probably yes.”

When 
asked 
if 
they 
were 

registered to vote, 91 percent of the 
respondents responded ‘yes.’ Seven 
percent reported that they were not 
registered, and 1 percent responded 
as too young to vote.

When given the option of every 

candidate on the ballot, 70 percent of 
the respondents said they would vote 
for Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton. The rest of the group was 
split mostly between GOP nominee 
Donald Trump (12 percent) and 
Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson 
(11.7 percent). However, when only 

given the option of Clinton, Trump 
or “other,” the numbers changed, 
with 75 percent saying they would 
vote for Clinton and 15 percent 
saying they would vote for Trump.

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

President of College Republicans, 
said the Daily’s polling is reflective 
of the growing base of supporters 
Trump has in Michigan.

“Mr. Trump polling at nearly 

double 
that 
of 
the 
previous 

Michigan Daily poll is tangible proof 
of College Republicans’ efforts in 
advocating the Trump campaign 
amongst our membership,” Zalamea 
said. “Just last Friday we took a 
group of UMCR members to attend 
Mr. Trump’s Novi Michigan Rally, 
where his campaign was generous 
enough to provide us with VIP 

seating. Mr. Trump even spoke to 
us privately before the rally to thank 
us all for our efforts in volunteering 
for and promoting his campaign. 
The rally itself drew an incredibly 
passionate crowd in the thousands 
and maintained an energy level 
unparalleled to any political event I 
have ever attended.”

College Democrats declined to 

comment. 

When compared to a poll done by 

the Daily on Sept. 18, more students 
said they would vote for Clinton 
at 74 percent, but fewer reported 
that they would vote for Trump at 
6 percent. Gary Johnson’s support 
remains steady.

Open letter to the U of M community

THE BLACK LEADERSHIP COUNCIL | OP-ED

T

o the 
University 
of 

Michigan Community:

In light of recent 

events, both on and off campus, 
we are deeply disturbed by 
the hateful and blatant racism 
put forth by people who label 
themselves the alt-right. It 
troubles us that the individuals 
of the Black community at 
the University of Michigan 
targeted 
by 
these 
posters 

and flyers are not only being 
stereotyped by incorrect data, 
but are also being made to feel 
unvalued and unwelcomed on 
the University campus.

We 
acknowledge 
the 

statements 
and 
appreciate 

the actions made by both the 
University and student activists 
on campus. We understand the 
University has not yet found 
the individual or individuals 
responsible for this cowardly 
act. However, we wish to 
bring attention to the fact 
that there is an alt-right blog 
that has used the University’s 
name in its title. Not only does 
this blog use phrases such as 
“harass,” “viscously attack” 
and “humiliate and destroy,” 
it also states that there is a 
potential Alt-Right Club at the 
University.

While freedom of speech 

is 
important, 
all 
student 

organizations 
are 
required 

to adhere to the University’s 
Nondiscrimination 
Policy, 

which 
includes 
all 
online 

media, like blogs. We call 
upon the University to fulfill 
its obligations stated in the 
“Discrimination and Harassment 
Policy” and the University’s 
“Procedural 
Guidelines 
for 

Handling Discrimination and 
Harassment Complaints.” We 
request the University enforce 
its 
commitment 
to 
prevent 

and 
eliminate 
impermissible 

discrimination and harassment 
of students by conducting a 
formal 
investigation 
of 
the 

incident in accordance with 
the 
Procedural 
Guidelines; 

eliminating both the potential 
Alt-Right University of Michigan 
Club and corresponding online 
blog; monitoring posting walls, 
boards and other University 
advertising spaces daily; and 
formally condemning the alt-
right as a hate group. While 
taking these actions would 
help in the short term, it is 
imperative to long-term and 
sustainable success that all 
members of the University 
community, 
whether 
they 

are students or staff, act in 
a way that is conducive to 
realizing the vision for “a 
campus environment where 
all students, faculty, and staff 
feel welcomed and valued. ...” 
as outlined in the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan.

In order for this vision to be 

realized, our responses must 
transcend written statements 
and lead to concrete action. 

The 
issues 
and 
problems 

surrounding campus climate 
are too great for a single 
group to take on alone. As 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel stated during the 
Black Student Union meeting 
on Sept. 29, it is necessary 
that we work together.

While we desire to solve the 

issues 
surrounding 
campus 

climate, we recognize that a 
solution to such a large problem 
will take time. We need time 
to heal. We need time to 
listen to and receive input 
from all members of the Black 
community to understand what 
they need, not just what we 
think they need. Above all, we 
need time to not only discuss 
how we can work together to 
bring about change, but to also 
discuss what unity in the Black 
community looks like outside 
of tragedy and pain.

Though 
we 
are 
leaders 

of 
various 
Black 
student 

organizations, we do not speak 
for the entire Black community; 
we speak so the members of the 
Black community know that 
their individual voices matter, 
that their individual lives matter.

The 
Black 
Leadership 

Council at the University of 
Michigan.

I

n perhaps one of the most 
memorable lines from the 
comical 
first 
presidential 

debate, candidate Hillary Clinton 
captured all of the qualms I have 
with Donald Trump: “Well, Donald, 
I know you live in your own reality, 
but that is not the facts.”

If you didn’t watch the debate 

because 
of 
time 
constraints, 

I suggest finding an abridged 
version on YouTube and ramping 
up the speed to 1.5x (it actually 
helps Hillary’s incessant pausing). 
A word of advice: Try not to get 
frustrated by Trump’s repeated 
mansplaining. A PBS article cites 
51 interruptions by Donald Trump, 
as opposed to 17 interruptions by 
Hillary Clinton.

Watching the debate, I tried to 

not get distracted by the constant 
interruptions, the incessant raising 
of voices and the unprofessional 
digs. As a junior in the Ford School, 
I focused my attention to all 
mentions of policy. But something 
about the way Donald Trump 
speaks occupied my brainpower. 
Trump’s speech is so unverifiable 
that he has complete liberty to say 
whatever he wants.

And that kind of explains his 

rhetoric, right? By using words 
such as “perhaps,” “probably,” 
“private,” 
“maybe,” 
etc., 
etc., 

Trump is able to say practically 
whatever fits the moment without 
anyone proving him wrong.

Take, for example, the moment 

when Clinton pointed out the 
architect in the audience who was 
stiffed by Trump after designing a 
clubhouse. Trump’s only response 
was, “Maybe he didn’t do a good 
job and I was unsatisfied with his 
work.” See that? It’s not that Donald 
Trump admits he was unsatisfied 
and didn’t pay the man, it’s that 
there’s a possibility he maybe wasn’t 
satisfied. In other words, he shifts 
the accountability from himself to 
no one. And that’s a dangerous trait 
for a presidential nominee.

Another example of Trump-

talk occurs when he’s asked about 
birtherism and healing the racial 

divide. “I think I’ve developed very, 
very good relationships over the 
last little while with the African-
American community,” he said. “I 
think you can see that.” The content 
of this quote perfectly captures 
Donald Trump’s dismal engagement 
with African-American voters and 
communities “over the last little 
while.” But let’s look at his style of 
delivery of these so-called facts: “I 
think I’ve developed,” “I think you 
can see that.” Once again, we hear 
Trump abstractly state a pseudo-
fact. It’s not that he’s saying, “I have 
developed X and Y relationships, 
as a matter of fact.” Rather, he’s 
playing with minds of voters with 
his unverifiable Trump-talk.

But why does this matter? I argue 

that speech and rhetoric forecast 
the nation we will live in for the 
next four or more years. So we, 
the American electorate, must ask 
ourselves: What kind of nation do 
we want to live in?

Do we want to live in fear for 

the next four years, forced to hide 
behind walls, scared of foreign 
ideas and enemies? Do we want to 
monopolize on freedom, liberty 
and equality while erecting borders 
and barriers? Or would we rather 
break down walls, lend a helping 
hand to our neighbors and work 
together toward a brighter, more 
tolerant future? Until we stop 
pointing fingers at the “Others,” and 
realize that we are the Others, we 
will continue to divide ourselves. A 
wall works both ways, and so does 
divisive rhetoric.

Let’s work as a nation to turn our 

pointed fingers into extended hands 
to help those around us. Secretary 
Clinton put it best in her Democratic 
National Convention speech when 
she said, “No one gets through life 
alone. We have to look out for each 
other and lift each other up.”

With 
job-searching 
in 
full 

swing, I look to the future with one 
particular goal in mind. My goal is 
to establish and strengthen empathy 
in governments at home and abroad. 
Empathy, once nourished and grown 
in the hearts of people, has the power 

to mitigate conflict, cast away hate 
and establish love. Empathy gives us 
the ability to see ourselves in the eyes 
of our opponents and realize that 
we’re all not so different. We stand on 
a common ground, albeit sometimes 
opposite sides of that ground. But we 
learn to walk from birth so we can 
meet in the middle and compromise 
with our fellow humans. Empathy 
helps us, as President Obama said at 
the DNC, conduct a “contest of ideas 
that pushes our country forward.” 
In fact, empathy is at the heart of 
democracy.

Now, empathy doesn’t call on 

people to hold hands, dance around 
the proverbial campfire and sing 
“Kumbaya.” Empathy helps us 
communicate our concerns in a 
productive manner so that the 
women and men we electcan find 
solutions. How can we expect our 
communities to stay safe, and our 
friends and families to be content in 
a supposed Union, if we can’t hear 
each other out long enough to come 
to a compromise?

To quote The Rolling Stones, 

“You can’t always get what you 
want. But if you try sometimes, well 
you just might find, you get what 
you need.”

So what do we need, America? 

Well, as I examine the two 
nominees, I conclude that they’re 
not running for the same position. 
No, in fact we have two offices up 
for grabs. While Secretary Clinton 
is running for the traditional office 
of the president of the United 
States of America, I believe Donald 
Trump has his eyes set on a new 
position: president of the Divided 
States of America. 

I call upon my fellow Americans 

to work toward union, not division. 
Exercise your right to vote and vote 
with empathy in mind. Remember, 
we are the Others. Come Nov. 
8, I’ll be voting with my Muslim 
community’s slogan in mind: Love 
for All, Hatred for None.

DONELLY-

DEROVEN

I

’ve always had a morbid 
curiosity with stalking dead 
strangers on the internet. 

The first dead stranger I remember 
stalking was Anna 
Svidersky. 
Svidersky 

was 
a 
17-year-old 

girl 
who 
lived 
in 

Vancouver, 
Wash., 

and 
was 
originally 

from a small town in 
Russia. She worked 
at a McDonald’s and 
was stabbed to death 
at work less than a 
week before her 18th 
birthday by a random 
schizophrenic 
man 

who 
was 
also 
a 

convicted sex offender.

I found out about Svidersky’s 

murder during the summer of 
2008 when I was 12 and had made 
a habit out of watching sad videos 
on YouTube, specifically videos 
set to Avril Lavigne background 
music — I was very moody. I 
watched as many slideshows of 
Svidersky set to pop-emo music 
as I could find. After that, I 
scoured her MySpace page and 
consumed unhealthy amounts of 
news stories about her murder.

I don’t know why I still know 

so much about Anna Svidersky. 
It’s really weird, and it actually 
makes me feel sort of gross. But 
what’s even more unsettling is that 
I still do things like this: I have an 
informal list of dead people I don’t 
know whose Facebooks I go to 
when I’ve run out of live people to 
stalk. Looking at dead strangers’ 
Facebook pages feels like a kind 
of pseudo-coping: I use others’ 
tragedies in order to simulate my 
own sadness. But I don’t actually 
know the people, so I don’t actually 
care. It’s like poverty porn, only 
it’s others’-pain-and-suffering-in-
order-to-give-myself-an-artificial-
and-controlled-emotional-
response-and-also-assuage-my-
distasteful-curiosity porn.

This strange (and potentially 

offensive) habit of mine probably 
has 
something 
to 
do 
with 

the 
strangeness 
of 
internet 

immortality. But it likely has more 
to do with me as a person and with 
my socialization in a culture that’s 
incredibly 
uncomfortable 
with 

non-ironic emotional expression.

Emotional expressions make 

me feel awkward: crying in front 
of people, grieving, expressing 

gratitude, 
admiring 
beauty, 

admitting love, etc. Sometimes 
when I’m about to cry in public, 
in order to avoid it or to deflect 

attention 
away 
from 

myself I say — ironically, 
of course — that I’ve built 
a reputation for myself 
as someone who doesn’t 
outwardly express her 
emotions. 
Emotional 

expressions make me 
uncomfortable because I 
have a hard time “doing” 
my emotions in a way 
that feels honest. Usually 
it feels like an “Am I 
actually 
feeling 
this? 

Or am I just doing this 

because we have a greeting card 
industry and I watch a lot of TV and 
when everyone else performs this 
emotion it always looks like this?” 
sort of way.

I’m thinking about all this 

because last Friday my really good 
friend had a stroke, and I’m having 
a hard time “processing.” Among 
other things, this friend and I 
have oddly built our relationship 
around this distaste for emotional 
expression. Neither of us are 
“huggers,” and usually instead of 
saying that someone hurt or upset us 
we say they’re “being a fuckhead.” 
We have an almost pathological 
aversion to sentiment, and I don’t 
think that makes us unique. In fact, 
I think an aversion to sentiment is 
actually a uniting factor for people 
our age in this specific cultural 
moment, and I think meme culture 
best exemplifies this.

Memes are about heavy stuff: 

racism, sexism, breaking up with 
partners, feeling like you’re wasting 
your 
life, 
being 
overworked, 

underpaid and exhausted, etc. 
These are serious things that we 
have serious feelings about. But 
memes are also ironic. There’s no 
such thing as a serious meme — I 
mean there is, but it’s ironic about 
the fact that it’s serious. Memes take 
our emotions about heavy things, 
which at times can feel debilitating 
and all-encompassing and even 
embarrassing, and pairs them with 
a silly photo in order to make us 
laugh about our pain, in order to 
make the emotion digestible.

The use of irony as a coping 

mechanism is nothing new, and 
it’s 
nothing 
that’s 
necessarily 

problematic. I like irony a lot of the 
time, but I worry that our use of 

irony has become too layered, that 
it’s become a totality: And by that 
I mean that we literally can’t say 
anything serious anymore. (Also, 
I’m not the first person to worry 
about this. Check out David Foster 
Wallace’s essay E Unibus Pluram: 
Television and U.S. Fiction.)

When people say serious things, 

they (we) worry about sounding 
cliché. This is a hard thing to worry 
about because it’s mostly true: 
Almost everything that isn’t ironic 
can sound cliché. We have too many 
behavioral referents, too many 
cultural examples of people acting 
out this emotion and this situation 
for us to feel like we actually 
decided how we wanted to have 
and feel and show this emotion. 
So it feels phony and dishonest to 
say anything serious, even if you 
mean it, because you’re unable to 
articulate if you really feel this way 
and want to do this thing to express 
this emotion, or if you’re just doing 
it because that’s how you’ve seen it 
done before and how you feel like 
you’re supposed to do it.

It’s a crisis of authenticity. It’s 

an alienation from the self where 
we don’t see ourselves as human 
individuals with agency, but rather 
subjects within an ideology that 
says feelings and sentiment are 
lame, and there’s no way to not be 
cliché except by being ironic. We see 
no other way out, so we oblige. 

Consuming 
dead 
strangers’ 

Facebook pages doesn’t require me 
to have serious emotions; in fact, 
I can list it off as an ironic activity 
I do when I’m asked about that 
sort of thing. But I think I use it as 
a way to prove to myself that I can 
do emotional expression, that I can 
privately, genuinely feel a thing and 
that it’s not all just a performance. 
But when an actual sad thing 
happens in my life, I don’t know 
what to do with all my feelings. I 
get stuck in a cycle of wondering 
if I actually feel this way or if I’m 
just performing my sadness this 
way because this is what it looks 
like when other people do it. So I 
don’t cry and I try to avoid talking 
about the fragility of human life. 
I say stupid things about meme 
culture and stalk dead strangers on 
Facebook. I get stuck in irony.

IBRAHIM IJAZ | OP-ED

Ibrahim Ijaz is a public policy junior.

A

s someone who firmly 
believes in the value of 
aid work and service 

to others, and providing I 
spent last summer working at 
a Buddhist nunnery where I 
performed intensive community-
based 
inquiry 
to 
create 

comprehensive 
examples 
of 

good communication with local 
people as a means of improving 
the conduct of foreign aid 
groups, I have a few important 
words to share in response to 
one of my classmate’s critical 
remarks on the matter.

My classmate described her 

thoughts about “two realms of 
protecting human rights” like 
this: On one hand, you have 
the people who are tending to 
the injuries that the system 
inflicts 
on 
disadvantaged 

groups. On the other, you 
have the real heroes that are 
actively working to dismantle 
the roots of oppression and 
suffering inlaid in the system. 
She continued saying if we 
want to end injustice, we must 
go straight to the root; all other 
ventures only serve to detract 
from this overall goal, and play 
a major role in perpetuating 
human suffering.

But what I think is even more 

“harmful” than attending to the 
damage inflicted by systematic 
abuse is attempting to fragment 
the solidarity of social justice 
workers by asserting that one 
category of social justice work 
is fundamentally more valuable 
than another. The point is not 
to victimize aid workers for 
“ignoring the roots of suffering,” 
nor is it to create a moral chasm 
between two groups that are 
fighting for the same purpose, 
the same humanity.

Systematic 
change 
is, 
of 

course, our main priority on the 
path to ending human suffering 

in all shapes and forms. I do not 
refute this fact. I dream of a 
world in which the systematic 
factors that cause voices to 
cry out for help are destroyed 
so there are no reasons to cry 
out for help in the first place. 
Unfortunately, it will be a 
long and arduous process to 
arrive at a political, economic 
and legal infrastructure that 
flawlessly eradicates all of the 
internal factors that fuel this 
endless stream of injustices 
against humanity. Let alone a 
system that functions within all 
worldly borders.

My 
point: 
We 
must 
all 

cooperate on a united front. 
We need the whole range of 
social justice workers to drive 
the movement forward. As we 
actively work to disassemble 
the overarching structures that 
are the root causes of suffering, 
we must simultaneously serve 
and pay active attention to 
the victims of these structural 
abuses. What’s more, we must 
ensure this aid is lasting and 
effective. We cannot simply 
ignore the human suffering of 
today in the name of completely 
eradicating human suffering in 
the future.

Instead 
of 
victimizing 

aid 
workers 
and 
charity 

organizations 
for 
providing 

pseudo-aid, we should focus on 
improving the framework of the 
humanitarian aid sector so its 
overall impact is quantifiably 
beneficial. Most importantly, we 
must scrap the aged method of 
self-directed, imperialistic-style 
foreign-aid projects and instead 
dive deep into perspectives of 
the actual victims of systematic 
injustice. The problem is not 
humanitarian 
aid 
by 
itself, 

but rather the rampant lack 
of diligence that plagues this 
sector.

A significant example of this 

is what has been occurring in 
the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. For more than a 
century, the country has been 
overwhelmed 
by 
regional 

conflict and a deadly struggle for 
its vast mineral resources. The 
hunger for Congo’s abundant 
natural resources has been a 
chief driver of brutalities and 
conflict throughout the country’s 
history. In eastern Congo today, 
these mineral resources are 
funding several armed groups, 
and these groups use mass gang 
rape as a methodical tactic to 
control local populations, thus 
securing control of mines and 
trading routes.

“I now pronounce you man and 

wife.”

You know the deal — white 

dresses, 
flow-

ers, 
kissing, 
an 

exchange of rings, 
a promise of this 
thing called forever 
— before a priest, 
a rabbi, a judge, a 
confession in front 
of loved ones and that distant aunt 
you had to invite despite your dis-
taste for her political views and 
loud chewing.

Fiction writer Katie Chase, who 

is reading at Literati tonight at 7 
p.m., has crafted her debut col-
lection of short stories upon this 
phrase. Her stories explore the 
strange world of marriage tradition 
in terms of gender, family dynamics 
and the public and private ways we 
grow up in a bizarre and arbitrarily 
gendered world.

“The expectations that our soci-

ety, and others, have not just for 
women but for men, seem endlessly 
strange and fascinating to me,” 
Chase wrote in an email interview. 
“Fiction, as an endeavor that is 
equal parts intellectual and emo-
tional, seems the proper place to 
probe those thoughts and feelings.”

Chase grew up in a suburb out-

side of Detroit and graduated from 
the University of Michigan with 
a B.A. in English in 2002, where 
she studied with English profes-
sors Eileen Pollack and Peter Ho 
Davies and lecturer Tish O’Dowd. 
She then went on to get her MFA 
in Fiction from the Iowa Writers’ 

Workshop.

Her title story, 

“Man and Wife,” 
draws 
on 
heavy 

influence 
from 

women 
writ-

ers such as Edith 
Wharton, 
Alice 

Munro and Margaret Atwood. 
It’s also inspired by writing that 
has revolved around women, the 
institution of marriage and how it 
marks a female life.

“I knew I wanted to make work 

that reacted in some way to what 
has been considered ‘female,’ and 
I was excited by the possibilities 
of working in more imaginative 
territory, with creative worlds and 
premises,” Chase said.

“Man and Wife” focuses on 

nine-and-a-half-year-old 
Mary 

Ellen, betrothed to a much older 
man whom she has never met. “The 
Hut” tells the story of the narrator’s 
visceral loneliness upon getting 
her period for the first time. Chase 
wrote that in stories like these, she 
unpacks “a little more forthrightly 
what it feels like to be initiated into 
womanhood.”

The work of fiction has the Mid-

western touch of Chase’s suburban 
Detroit upbringing. In one story, 
“Creation Story,” the female pre-
teen narrator observes her ado-
lescent brother in rituals different 
than her own. The story is tinged 
with distinct tones of industrial 
development and automobile cul-
ture.

In playing with rites of passage 

in imaginative space, Chase wrote 
that the story “Every Good Mar-
riage Begins in Tears” “came more 
out of research and a desire to put 
myself, insofar as that is impossible, 
within the bounds of another cul-
ture.” The story is a vodka-soaked 
narrative that takes place in post-
Soviet Kyrgyzstan.

“I do see so many of the prem-

ises and worlds in the book to be 
exaggerations of reality, not merely 
their own fictions,” Chase wrote. “I 
do hope it can make readers see our 
world anew.”

Although the collection enters 

realms of the uncanny or surreal, 
the stories hold a kernel of honest 
fact, humor and strangeness about 
the grit of what it is to be a woman, 
bound within the structure of his-
torical rite and tradition. With her 
fiction, she bestows upon her audi-
ence an opportunity for rich imagi-
nation — a chance to lift the veil, 
stories that question the vows, an 
invitation to enter the history and 
secrets of not-quite-girls but not-
quite-women beyond their place as 
figures atop a cake.

ALBUM REVIEW

Take off, if you can, those 

heavy winter jackets, those well-
worn boots and that general 
sense of brooding, 
melancholy 
listlessness which 
define the latter 
months of the year. 
Bon Iver, once an 
impressionistic 
staple 
of 
that 

season, certainly 
has.

The pet project of Justin 

Vernon, a native of Wisconsin 
(and, accordingly, the general 
sadness which accompanies a 
state subdued by a winter which 
stretches its arms too far), Bon 
Iver once defined that particular 
winter mood. Their very name 
makes reference to it, an alteration 
of the French phrase “bon hiver,” 
meaning “good winter.” Though 
the band has never been one to 
subject itself to an exact musical 
style, moving from the stripped-
down 
arrangements 
of 
their 

debut For Emma, Forever Ago to 
a fuller, more orchestral sound on 
Bon Iver, Bon Iver, their music has 
occupied a clear space. Vernon 
himself acknowledged this at a 
recent press conference in his 
home town of Eaux Claire: “… (T)
he old records are of this kind of 
sad nature — I was healing myself 
through that stuff. Being sad 
about something is okay. And then 
wallowing in it, circling though 
the same cycles emotionally just 
feels boring.” These are not the 
words of status quo.

Neither is the band’s first album 

in nearly five years, 22, A Million. 
If the immediacy of change doesn’t 
hit you so clearly on opener “22 
(OVER SooN),” the electric field 
of “10 d E A T h b R E a s T” will 
make it abundantly clear. This 
is the sound of iconoclasm, of a 
desperate need to break what once 
was and rearrange the pieces. 
That contravention is everywhere 
on 22, A Million. Most obvious is 
the destruction of the song title: 
names once quaint and grounded 
(“Woods,” “Calgary,” “Flume”) 
have 
become 
bombastic 
and 

confounding 
(“29 
#Strafford 

APTS,” “715 - CReeKS”).

But beyond the superficial, like 

the equally chaotic album cover, 
there is, too, a clear departure from 

the past here lyrically. Vernon’s 
lyrics have become defined by 
their vague mystique, but they 
nonetheless always paint cerebral 
scenes. 
Previous 
landscapes 

have mirrored their song titles, 

whispering 
about 

the 
interior 
and 

the 
calm, 
as 
in 

“Holocene,” 
in 

which 
he 
coos, 

“Christmas night, it 
clutched the light, 
the hallow bright.” 
Here, he turns his 
face more outward, 

describing his love in distance — 
“Said I would have walked across 
any thousand lands” — and hinting 
at a more restless being, including 
a distorted vocal of Stevie Nicks’s 
“Wild Heart.”

There 
will 
be 
an 
easy 

comparison 
made 
between 

22, A Million and Radiohead’s 
experimental album Kid A. In 
many respects there is a strong 
line between the two: both employ 
significant vocal distortion, a 
departure from once was and a 
sense of fragmentation. But 22, A 
Million, while a break, doesn’t feel 
quite so violent in its aspirations. 
There is a stronger continuation 
of the past on this album than Kid 
A allows. With enough listens, 
the dissonance of the electronic 
production calmed, 22, A Million 
will sound closer to what was than 
the veneer it first gives off.

Take “715 - CReeKS,” which has 

no instrumental and leaves just 
the auto-tuned vocals of Vernon to 
stand on their own. If you squint, 
you can see For Emma, Forever Ago 
in its empty arrangement. And the 
powerful lead single “33 “GOD”” 
recalls the quiet grandiosity of 
Bon Iver, Bon Iver opener “Perth.” 
Breaking and picking up the 
pieces, Vernon keeps certain gems 
fully intact.

The best moments of 22, A 

Million are when Bon Iver can 
combine the bluster of their new 
instruments with the quiet force 
they previously perfected. “29 
#Strafford APT” is a clear product 
of this. For much of the track, one 
can forget that anthemic songs like 
“10 d E A T h b R E a s T” introduced 
the album. It starts with confident 
whispers and sparse instruments; 
a distant pulse of jazz enters 
the background every so often, 
accompanied by a meandering 
acoustic guitar so defining of 

the band. The true magic here, 
though, is the faltering conclusion, 
when the vocals are artificially cut 
and distorted as they ascend the 
scale. It’s a disarming moment of 
clarity, where the electronic and 
the stripped-away balance one 
another lightly, perfectly.

Conversely, the most in-your-

face electronic distortion can be 
some of the most fascinating here. 
The transition between “21 MooN 
WATER” and “8 (Circle)” finds a 
wandering saxophone solo turn 
into a frenzied yelp before landing 
easily at the introduction of “8 
(Circle)” ’s soft synths. It recalls 
in execution Frank Ocean’s recent 
foray into the strange: the intro 
of Blonde’s “Pretty Sweet.” Both 
are moments of discord which 
jar the listener, realigning them 
again with the peaceful directly 
afterwards.

Given the blatantly separate 

worlds conjured on each of 
the band’s three LP ventures, 
determining 
their 
relative 

quality to one another is bound 
to be a difficult endeavor. For 
Emma, Forever Ago is a far more 
emotionally cathartic album than 
what you’ll find here, but it lacked 
the kind of skilled arrangements 
which found themselves on Bon 
Iver, Bon Iver. The inventiveness 
of this album is unmatched in 
their discography — even the 
words here are new (“Paramind,” 
or the unforgettable “Fuckified”). 
Vernon has discussed wanting 
to create new instruments and 
sounds, 
and 
that’s 
certainly 

accomplished on 22, A Million.

But what seems to be lacking 

(and maybe just ever so slightly) 
is the ethereal quality which 
settles after a listen to the band’s 
self-titled masterpiece. However 
bombastic, this release still feels 
less impactful and resonant 
than that one. The sheer beauty 
of 
that 
landscape, 
constant 

and consuming, isn’t so here. 
Perhaps it’s on account of that 
inventiveness, slightly shading 
the heart to which Bon Iver are 
so adept at speaking. Regardless, 
it’s clear that Bon Iver are still 
at the forefront of a concept. No 
matter how static and stretched 
they make it, the catharsis of 
Vernon’s pitch, the quiet pulse 
of the drums and the fleeting 
instrumentals still strike with an 
inner force few other bands can 
even dream of.

‘22’ is the most inventive 
album yet from Bon Iver

MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Justin Vernon gets weird, but stays mostly true to himself

There’s a little something 

for all Fab Four fans in “The 
Beatles: Eight Days a Week – 
The 
Touring 

Years,” the new 
documentary 
by Ron Howard 
(“Rush”). 
Fol-

lowing the most 
famous 
rock 

group in history 
from their days 
as a Liverpudlian 
skiffle group to 
international 
sensation only a few years later, 
the film, as the title indicates, 
serves as an exploration of The 
Beatles specifically during, not 
before or after, their meteoric 
rise and groundbreaking trans-
formation.

Through a mixture of video 

(much of which was restored in 
stunning 4K) and audio footage 
and interviews in the present, 
from both obvious subjects and 
a few surprising ones, Howard 
is able to string together a cohe-
sive tale of youthful exuberance 
and rebellion. The film’s editing 
and structure — kinetic, chaotic 
and disorganized — matches 
the band itself. The Beatles’ 
brash sound and defining jux-
taposition of mopheads in suits 
proved overwhelmingly scin-
tillating for its massive base of 
dedicated fans. Interviews with 
Larry Kane, a radio journalist 
assigned to follow The Beatles 
on tour and provided coverage 

of Beatlemania at its peak, pro-
vide the rather non-cohesive 
narrative structure for the film.

After their early albums, 

The 
Beatles 
became 
more 

experimental. In 1965 and 1966 

respectively, 
they 

released 
Rubber 

Soul and Revolver, 
unequivocally two 
of 
the 
greatest 

works of art ever 
created. They grew 
up, started taking 
drugs and settled 
down with wives in 
large homes. They 
became real peo-

ple, agitated at interview ques-
tions, needing to take breaks in 
between their tiresome record-
ing schedules. They recorded 
less and less. They stopped 
making 
films. 
And, 
most 

importantly for the film, tours 
became sources of frustration: 
audience members came to see 
(and scream at) the group, not 
listen to their music. The Bea-
tles played Candlestick Park 
in San Francisco on August 29, 
1966. Nearly a year later, they 
released Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club Band, an album 
Howard upholds with a great 
personal reverence. They didn’t 
perform in public for two and a 
half years.

The members of The Beatles 

may find their success a cosmic 
joke (their humor is a recur-
ring message in the film), but 
their importance nonetheless 
remains. In the mid-1960s, a 
president had been assassinat-

ed, nuclear testing signaled an 
impending nuclear doom and 
the civil rights movement had 
reached its peak. Americans 
needed escapism, but no one 
could have predicted it would 
come from four English twenty-
somethings with messy hair. 
But the film only lightly touch-
es on these themes. Howard 
could have attempted to explain 
Beatlemania, but he defers to 
(beautifully restored) archival 
footage.

While little new information 

is provided by the film — much, 
even that given by Ringo Starr 
and Paul McCartney, could be 
gleaned from a Wikipedia deep 
dive — its charm is undeniable. 
But undoubtedly that charm 
comes from the subject material 
itself, not from any filmmaking 
techniques exhibited by How-
ard.

I’ve never been a die-hard 

Beatles fan. I’ve enjoyed much 
of their music, especially the 
middle period, but I could hap-
pily go a few months without 
listening to their tunes. How-
ard’s film has probably reversed 
that. A coda, the group’s 1969 
rooftop performance, is beyond 
triumphant. Whether Howard’s 
film is responsible, I, like many 
others, feel personally connect-
ed to John, Paul, George and 
Ringo. Their songs are anthems, 
not earworms. Their style is 
revolutionary, not silly. And 
while Howard’s documentary 
may have its fair share of flaws, 
I’ll be damned if I didn’t have 
fun watching it.

“Pull my fingers.”

MUSIC COLUMN

The Killers were the 
end of a golden era

I 

was wearing dog ears made 
out of paper and black eye 
pencil on my nose when I 

finally realized how powerful 
“Mr. Brightside” could be.

It was Halloween of 2015. I 

was dressed as Mr. Peanutbut-

ter from “BoJack Horseman,” 
and I was in a Kerrytown 
basement with a faulty stereo 
system. The music was great, 
but the songs would sometimes 
cut out for minutes at a time — 
people would trip over a cord or 

knock against the speaker the 
wrong way or something, and 
we’d be stuck in awkward, dis-
appointed silence until it got 
fixed.

Anyway, “Mr. Brightside” 

comes on, and if you’re a fan of 

ADAM 

THEISEN

10 years since “When You Were Young,” their work still stands alone

Superheroes are good, and 

supervillains 
are 
bad. 
It’s 

black and white. Simple. Chil-
dren and adults 
alike have read, 
collected 
and 

adored Marvel’s 
classic 
comic 

books, 
living 

through heroes 
that 
conquer 

villains 
in 
a 

universe 
that 

builds an almost 
naive 
concep-

tion that, above 
all 
else, 
jus-

tice will come 
out on top. But 
“Marvel’s Luke 
Cage” does something different 
in its adaptation of the beloved 
1972 comic. Set in a dynamic 
and dangerous Harlem, “Luke 
Cage” steps into reality, where 
things aren’t quite as simple 
as good and evil. In real life, 
even the good guys have a little 
streak of bad in them, and the 
bad guys are just fighting from 
a different perspective.

The third Marvel series on 

Netflix, “Luke Cage” fits into 
the Marvel universe timeline by 
picking up a few months after 
the explosive “Jessica Jones” 
finale. This time, the story 
turns over to Jessica Jones’s 
love interest, Luke Cage (Mike 
Colter, “Agent X”), a bulletproof 
man who acquired his superhu-
man powers after a botched 
prison experiment. Hiding out 
in Harlem and living on cash 
only jobs, Luke is keeping a 
low profile, desperately trying 
to run from his past and the 
impending onset of his “gifted” 
present. “Luke Cage” is a story 
of embracing one’s identity – 
superhuman 
and 
otherwise 

– and living in a reality where 
that identity might be ques-
tioned, torn down and taken 
advantage of.

Writer, producer and show-

runner Cheo Hodari Coker 
(“Southland”) told the Wash-

ington Post, “I will never get 
tired of seeing a bulletproof 
Black man. Like Dr. Martin 
Luther King, like Malcolm X, 
like Medgar Evers or even from 
hip-hop in terms of Tupac and 

the Notorious B.I.G., 
so many of our heroes 
aren’t bulletproof, so 
when you have a bul-
letproof hero, even if 
you’re not telling a 
political story, seeing 
a bulletproof Black 
man in the world, has 
inherent politics.”

As the first Black 

superhero to lead a 
story in the Marvel 
cinematic universe, 
Colter’s 
perfor-

mance as Luke Cage 
is undeniably inspir-

ing. Just as the series addresses 
the issue of race, so does Col-
ter, embodying Harlem – and 
everything that comes with 
it – as an integral part of his 
character. 
In 
episode 
two, 

“Code of the Streets,” Luke 
monologues about one of his 
Black heroes, Crispus Attucks, 
the first American to die in the 
Revolutionary War. The series 
allows Cage to express his con-
nection with Black history and 
culture, as the script engages 
with Harlem’s saturated and 
complicated narrative. History, 
music (each episode is named 
after a Gang Starr song), sports 
and Black culture are deeply 
embedded in the narrative of 
Luke Cage, weaving in and out 
of the dialogue and constantly 
being portrayed in visual sym-
bols and cinematic homages. 
Without pushing a political 
agenda, the series adds to the 
current political conversation 
on what it means to be Black in 
America. “Luke Cage” succeeds 
in bringing depth and adding 
perspective to a discussion that 
hits close to home for its audi-
ence.

But ultimately, it’s the villain 

Cottonmouth (Mahershala Ali, 
“House of Cards”), who steals 
the show. In a dynamic and 
near-perfect performance, Ali’s 

portrayal of a power-hungry 
bad guy is both gloriously dis-
turbing and enchanting. While 
he operates far outside the law 
and possesses the unethical 
components that characterize 
him as “evil,” Cottonmouth is 
a villain who is allowed a com-
plex emotional narrative. At 
the end of episode two, we see 
him burst into tears after losing 
someone from his past, and just 
for a brief moment, the audi-
ence is able to forget his vil-
lainy. Despite his murders, his 
selfishness and his corrupt rise 
to power, he is not a “bad guy” 
from his own perspective. He’s 
just trying to succeed in a real-
ity painted in shades of grey, 
making Cottonmouth one of 
the most exciting characters to 
watch on screen.

The narrative glides effort-

lessly and swiftly through its 
13-episode arc, diversifying the 
storytelling through unusual 
and creative cinematic deci-
sions. The series doesn’t shy 
away from extreme high and 
low angles, breaks up time with 
flashbacks and memories, and 
is able to create high energy 
action scenes by altering the 
speed of their shots. Cinemato-
graphically, “Luke Cage” has a 
great deal of texture, pulling in 
the audience by breaking the 
fourth wall and allowing them 
to breathe as shots of a buzzing 
Harlem gloss over the screen.

“Luke Cage” skillfully plays 

on a wide range of human emo-
tions, eliciting laughs, sympathy 
and surprise. It pulls inspira-
tion from history while root-
ing itself in today’s pop culture, 
making it the perfect series for 
an all-consuming binge watch.

TV REVIEW

The Killers, you know there’s 
no greater rush of excitement 
than those opening guitar 
notes. You hear them come out 
of nowhere and it’s just deliri-
ous ecstasy, with 
the entire room 
suddenly united in 
a sweaty mess of 
jumps and shouts.

And that was 

the reaction at this 
Halloween party 
— until the speak-
ers gave way again. 
Except, the thing 
is, the lack of music 
didn’t stop the song. 
People kept singing the words, 
clapping along to the beat and 
turning the basement into a 
spontaneous a cappella party 
that lasted until the real “Mr. 
Brightside” came back with all 
its synth-pop spectacle.

There was a run in the mid-

2000s where everything The 
Killers made was a pure light 
of golden energy. Hot Fuss, 
their debut, remains one of 
the most beloved albums of its 
generation, “Mr. Brightside” is 
untouchable and anthems like 
“All These Things That I’ve 
Done,” “Somebody Told Me” 
and “When You Were Young” 
come closer than any other 
band’s attempts. I think in the 
right place, they could all pass 
the broken-speaker test.

And I’ve been thinking about 

“When You Were Young” in 
particular lately, because it just 
turned 10 years old, but I don’t 
think any rock song since has 
had anywhere near the cultural 
impact that it did. The Killers 
seem to be this special band 
that hit it big with anachronis-
tic, earnest rock ‘n’ roll, and no 
other artist has been able to use 
that formula to recapture the 
level of success they had.

The album that features 

“When You Were Young,” Sam’s 
Town, seems hard to imagine 
in 2016. After taking their cues 
from new wave British dance 
groups like Duran Duran and 
New Order for Hot Fuss, Bran-

don Flowers and his Las Vegas 
quartet rediscovered America, 
falling in love with Springsteen, 
cowboys and beards.

The result was a record that, 

despite being an over-
blown mess that too 
often confused loud-
ness and overstuffed 
arrangements with 
epic power, was still 
very easy to love. It 
had heart-on-sleeve, 
unselfconscious song 
writing, skyscraper-
huge choruses and a 
whirlwind of excite-
ment on every song. 

Critics at the time hated it (Rob 
Sheffield infamously gave it 
two stars in Rolling Stone), but 
it has remained a favorite with 
the general rock public, espe-
cially as it feels more and more 
unique as time goes on.

There’s a small canon of 

recent rock songs that continue 
to be beloved by everybody, but 
that canon seems to end around 
2006. There’s “All the Small 
Things” (1999), “Stacy’s Mom” 
(2003), “Sugar, We’re Goin’ 
Down” (2005) and perhaps 
“I Bet You Look Good on the 
Dancefloor” (2006), to name 
most of them.

And then there’s The Killers, 

and then after that we seem to 
stop. Of course, I’m not saying 
that The Killers are anywhere 
near the last great rock band, 
but they scored at least 5 or 6 
major hits, most of which still 
light up a party today. Bands in 
this era are extremely lucky to 
get even one song in that tail-
gate playlist.

And I’m sorry, but honestly, 

I don’t have a definitive answer 
for why this happened. There 
are definitely fewer people who 
listen exclusively to rock, which 
means an average band like 
Grand Funk Railroad in the ’70s 
or Live in the ’90s can’t score 
some radio play when no one else 
is making good music and get 
famous by default.

Major labels, too, aren’t invest-

ing in album production like they 

used to — I don’t know what the 
budget for Sam’s Town was, but 
it sounds expensive, and I really 
doubt it could have recouped its 
losses if it were released today.

And finally, perhaps, I think 

we’re seeing the effects of a 
backlash to the overwhelm-
ing straight white male-ness of 
mainstream rock, and a turn to 
traditionally more inclusive, yet 
critically scorned, sounds of R&B 
and dance music.

But I still have hope for the 

future. Rock music isn’t dying 
— if anything, with artists still 
on the upswing of their young 
careers like Modern Baseball, 
Hop Along, Mitski, Car Seat 
Headrest, Parquet Courts, 
Whitney and PWR BTTM, just 
to name a few, it might be more 
vital and varied than ever.

Beyond that, The Struts are 

starting to make a name for 
themselves with the kind of 
dumb, fun, beer commercial rock 
that still has a lot of fans, Walk 
the Moon scored a hit last year 
with the Hot Fuss-esque “Shut 
Up and Dance” and The 1975 
quietly became Tumblr teen idols 
and released I Like It When You 
Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful 
yet So Unaware of It, the kind of 
overblown, ambitious, aspiring-
to-legend-status record that The 
Killers were going for with Sam’s 
Town.

As fractured as the music 

world has gotten in the past few 
years, there are still some artists 
who unite us. The Killers remain 
one of them, standing alone as 
a rock band even a decade after 
their peak, and proving that we 
still love booming anthems and 
guitar solos. But while, right 
now, none of the up-and-coming 
young guitar bands have the 
special, ecstatic kind of song that 
pass the broken-speaker test, it 
would be crazy to count them 
out. I know we’ll be waiting with 
open ears when they deliver.

T

hough Jourdan Lewis 
will make Saturday’s top-
10 highlight reels for his 

late-game heroics, not one player 
better led the 
Wolverines to 
a 14-7 victory 
over No. 8 Wis-
consin than 
senior corner-
back Channing 
Stribling.

To be fair, 

Lewis’ pick was 
nothing short 
of miraculous. 
When Badgers quarterback Alex 
Hornibrook dropped back and 
launched the ball on 4th-and-10 
with just over two minutes left in 
the game, everyone at Michigan 
Stadium froze. But Lewis was 
there — almost too early, curiously 
floating for what seemed like an 
eternity before he grabbed the ball 
with one hand and tucked it in to 
cut short Wisconsin’s last breath.

If it weren’t for Lewis, 

Wisconsin could easily have 
been set up at midfield with two 
minutes of time to reach the end 
zone. Maybe the game would have 
gone to overtime.

But if it weren’t for Stribling, 

Michigan may have never been in 
that position in the first place.

Throughout all four quarters, 

the defense had to hold up 
the offense. In the first top-10 
matchup at the Big House since 
2003, Stribling showed up for all 
four quarters.

In the first quarter, he broke up 

his first pass of the game. In the 

second, he undercut a Wisconsin 
receiver and picked off the ball, 
giving the Wolverines possession 
at Wisconsin’s 44-yard line. In 
the fourth, he broke up a pass and 
picked up his second interception 
of the game.

Stribling shifted the momentum 

when his teammates seemed 
sluggish.

“I can think of two right now 

that were outstanding, they were 
testing him deep,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “I think 
he got his hands on four or five 
balls during the game, which is 
outstanding, and two interceptions. 
That’s outstanding for a corner. 
And he tackled. I thought he had a 
heck of a ballgame as well.”

It’s fair to say that Stribling 

wouldn’t have had his shining 
moment today if it weren’t for 
Lewis, though.

Stribling himself put it best 

after the game: “(Lewis) is an 
All-American, you’ve gotta go the 
other way!”

But this time, when the Badgers 

tested the corner without All-
American accolades, they got 
burned.

“(Wisconsin) tried to test us 

early, just figuring out who was 
the weak link, I guess,” Stribling 
said. “We didn’t have any, so after 
that, we worked.”

Neither Lewis nor Stribling 

showboat, but Lewis shows his 
confidence more outwardly than 
Stribling does. They’re different 
people and different players, so 
that makes sense.

But Stribling thinks that that’s 

why others have doubted his level 
of composure when he knows he’s 
always been self-assured, even from 
the first day he stepped on campus.

“Kinda back to my freshman 

year coming in, I had the same 
kind of confidence,” Stribling 
said. “When the coaches have 
confidence in you, the sky’s the 
limit. Just bringing it back to 
myself, especially this year, this last 
year, just making sure I had it.”

Stribling later added: “I’m not 

like a ‘rah-rah’ guy. I mean, I get 
a little rowdy, but you see JD, 
you know he gets rowdy. He’s out 
there. When I get confident, I’m 
calm, just like, ‘OK, I’m good.’ ”

The last time he had two or more 

picks in a game was his senior year 
of high school, when he had three. 
This season, Stribling had a pick-six 
against Hawaii, but so did Delano 
Hill, and the Wolverines dropped 
63 points on the Rainbow Warriors. 
The points came from just about 
everywhere.

But this time, the interceptions 

and pass breakups came against 
a talented top-10 team with two 
wide receivers who had already 
logged more than 200 receiving 
yards this season.

Stribling was asked after the 

game if this was the biggest 
performance of his career.

“I think so, (but) we still got 

plenty of games left,” Stribling said. 
“I think this was a stepping stone 
for me, proving to myself, proving 
to I guess a lot of people that I can 
make plays and do a lot of things, so 
I just gotta keep going with it.”

TAKE
UR PICK

Three missed field goals, all 

within makeable range, all in a 
close game.

That’s what the Michigan 

football team surrendered to 
Wisconsin on Saturday, taking 
nine points off the board against 
the nation’s No. 8 team. You don’t 
usually come back from that.

And yet, the fourth-ranked 

Wolverines were still standing 
Saturday night, when the clouds 
opened up and gave way to the 
rain that, if you looked only at the 
stat sheet, you might have thought 
was present all game long.

How 
else 
to 
explain 

Michigan’s 0-for-3 showing on 
field goals in a game in which 
they needed them? Fifth-year 
senior kicker Kenny Allen made 
81.8 percent of his field goals 
last season. But in the second 
quarter, he missed two inside 44 
yards, sending his team into the 
half up 7-0 instead of 13-0.

It might sound like a small 

difference, but in a game that 
boasted two of the nation’s best 
defenses, the Wolverines could 
ill afford those misses. Add in 
sophomore Ryan Tice’s missed 
field goal from 40 yards out in 

a tie game late in the third, and 
it’s a minor surprise Michigan 
emerged victorious from its first 
true battle of the season.

After the game, redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight tried to take the blame.

“Any time you leave points 

off the board, it’s not the 
goal, it’s not what you want,” 
Speight said. “But that’s not on 
the kicker, that’s on me as the 
quarterback, and on the offense 
to get the ball in the end zone.”

Speight said it was “unfair” 

to put pressure on a kicker on 
a windy day like Saturday, but 
when a top-five team leaves that 
many points off the board, it’s 
almost inevitable.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

bailed 
out 
the 
special 

teams Saturday, buoyed by 
three 
interceptions 
from 

its 
cornerbacks 
and 
timely 

pressure 
on 
the 
Badgers’ 

redshirt freshman quarterback, 
Alex 
Hornibrook. 
Redshirt 

sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Bryan Mone was back, giving 
Michigan its full rotation for the 
first time this season, and the 
benefit was evident.

“It was a game ball for 

Don Brown kind of a game,” 
Harbaugh said.

It may not have had to be, 

though. Up 7-0 with just under 10 
minutes left in the first half, Allen 
missed his first field goal from 31 
yards. He missed again from 43 
yards on the very next drive, his 
third straight miss dating back to 
the Colorado game.

That led Harbaugh to give 

Tice a shot when Michigan 
got into field-goal range on 
its second drive of the third 
quarter, this time in a tie game. 
The Wolverines had gotten as 
far as the Badgers’ 12-yard line 
on that drive, but after senior 
running back De’Veon Smith 
was stuffed for a loss of one, 
Speight took a nine-yard sack 
back to the 22-yard line.

Harbaugh singled out that 

sack — which put the ball at the 
right hash mark for Tice — as 
Speight’s only big mistake of 
the day, even despite throwing 
an 
interception. 
And 
the 

Wolverines paid for it when Tice 
missed wide right.

Now, even though his team 

survived the mishaps, Harbaugh 
has a decision on his hands.

With Allen having lost his 

form, and Tice an inexperienced 
walk-on, the Wolverines’ coach 
said there would be a kicking 
competition in the coming week. 
He said that he never thought

Fab Five still shapes the conversation
T

oday, they might not 
stand out.

Five young Black men in 

baggy shorts, 
black shoes 
and black 
socks with 
shaved heads 
isn’t a rarity on 
the basketball 
court. Not 
anymore, at 
least.

When the 

Fab Five burst 
into college 
basketball 25 years ago, that 
swaggering style was likened to 
thuggery. Now, it is as much a 
part of the game as free throws 
and Dick Vitale.

Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, Ray 

Jackson, Juwan Howard and 
Chris Webber didn’t just shake 
up the college hoops landscape, 
they put it in a blender and left 
it running for two years. The 
culture of basketball has shifted 
in the time since, moving (if ever 
so slowly) away from norms that 
call for obedience and order 
instead of personality.

But as symbolic and powerful 

as a pair of black tube socks can 
be, they can only go so far. Two 
more symbols used to hang from 
the Crisler Center rafters. The 
reason they don’t can be traced 
back to what was then, and still 
is, the plight of college athletes.

Marred by an improper benefits 

scandal that saw the physical 
embodiments of their time in 
Ann Arbor torn from the rafters, 
the Fab Five was temporarily 
disassociated from the University. 
But that’s no reason to stop 
learning from their time here.

They remain one of, if not the 

single, most significant examples 
of the conflicts between race, 
money and power in college 
sports. Saturday, three of the 
group’s members (Jackson, King 
and Rose) will visit campus for 

a public discussion about their 
legacy, bringing along a history so 
heavy and complicated it might 
not fit in Hill Auditorium.

It’s a discussion that shouldn’t 

need its own special event, but 
almost inarguably does.

King, Rose and Jackson will join 

LSA Professor Yago Colas; as well 
as journalist Kevin Blackistone, 
who is a visiting professor at 
University of Maryland; and 
University of Houston Professor 
Billy King at Hill Auditorium for a 
public discussion called “Fab 5 at 
25.” Colas will moderate the event, 
asking questions to the panelists 
himself first and then opening it 
up for questions from the public. 

The event is scheduled to last two 
hours. But what comes of it could 
endure much longer.

“I think what 

would feel best 
for me is for this 
to kind of kick off 
a conversation, 
or a series of 
conversations, 
that could occur 
over time on 
campus about 
some of the 
issues that, I 
think, the team 
and thinking about the team 
raise,” Colas said. “Specifically 
issues of race within college 

sports, especially in big-time 
college sports, and the related 
issues of money in college sports, 

educational 
opportunity in 
college sports for 
athletes.”

The history of 

the group has been 
well chronicled. In 
addition to their 
phenom statuses 
as freshmen, those 
five players’ radical 
defiance of the 
standards to which 

their predecessors and peers were 
held changed the culture of the 
sport. But today, that legacy seems 

outweighed by what came after 
they were gone.

The Ed Martin scandal rocked 

the Fab Five’s public perception 
and temporarily severed its ties 
with the University. Both wounds 
are only now really beginning to 
heal. The Fab Five’s perception is 
forever shaded by attitudes about 
their attitudes, critiques that 
might not have been heard about 
white players asserting the same 
intent to control their image. And, 
of course, the power dynamics 
that see college athletes generate 
so much interest and revenue 
but aren’t allowed to take home a 
penny of it.

Those issues have only 

increased in importance in 
the time since the Fab Five 
left campus. At a time when 
the debate of whether college 
athletes ought to be paid rages 
strongly, the Fab Five’s story is as 
important as ever. Someday, the 
benefits causing the scandal may 
no longer be deemed improper. 

Presumably, some students 

will be in attendance Saturday, 
some who are athletes and 
some who aren’t. Colas thinks 
both groups will have plenty to 
take away from the event, but 
for those who fill the bleachers 
on game days, there could be 
something extra to gain.

“I guess in a certain way, I do 

feel that, just because there are 
more students who aren’t athletes 
… I’d say there’s more urgency 
to the sort of vast number of 
students who are fans of Michigan 
athletes, to hear the stories of 
athletes and open themselves up 
to the experience emotionally of 
recognizing the humanity of the 
athlete,” Colas said.

Even while Jalen Rose calls 

for re-hanging the banners that 
were taken down in the wake of 
the Martin scandal, there is other 
change at stake on Saturday, 
change that extends beyond the 
rafters of Crisler Center. What 
that looks like remains to be seen. 
Colas said that after the event, 
they organizers will look at the 
reaction and go from there.

And even with the urgency 

Colas referenced, there’s still time 
for nuanced thought. Debates 
on money, race, power and 
amateurism aren’t going away, 
and this event invites Michigan 
back to the center of them.

No one is saying that these are 

issues that can be solved with a 
conversation. But they can’t be 
solved without one.

bultmanm@umich.edu and on 

Twitter @m_bultman. Please @ him.

Stribling has come a long way 

since 2013, when former Penn 
State wide receiver Allen Robinson 
caught a fourth-quarter pass over 
him that set up for the game-
tying score. It sent the game to 
quadruple overtime, where the 
Wolverines lost, 43-40. It even 
inspired Robinson to ink his side 
with the picture of the catch.

It’s unlikely that Stribling 

would allow something like that 
to happen again.

“He has his confidence 

back and he’s getting more 
comfortable with himself and he 
knows that he’s one of the best, 
really,” Lewis said. “I know he 
won’t ever say that, but I know 
he’s one of the best.” 

It’s hard to decide which 

corner will have a bigger impact 
on the season than the other, and 
it probably doesn’t matter for this 
reason: Michigan may have the 
best two in the Big Ten.

Hall can be reached at 

hallkl@umich.edu and on

handling all three kicking duties 
(field goals, kickoffs and punting) 
was “ideal” for Allen, and regardless 
of whether that is the case, Allen 
now finds himself in a fight with 
Tice for the placekicking job.

For his part, the fifth-year 

senior had a solid day punting the 
ball, pinning Wisconsin inside the 
20 four times and notching four 
punts of 50 or more yards.

With a trip to Rutgers looming, 

the Wolverines may not need a 
flawless performance from their 
kickers Saturday. But as Harbaugh 
pointed out, they will eventually.

After the game, Harbaugh was 

asked about the saying “defense 
wins championships,” a nod to 
the way Brown’s unit bailed out 
the mishaps on Saturday. He said 
he ascribes to the saying with 
one caveat.

“To 
win 
championships,” 

Harbaugh said, “you’ve gotta 
make field goals, too.”

Game-winning pass redeems passing game

In the third quarter of the 

Michigan football team’s game 
against Wisconsin, Bo Dever 
found his friend Jehu Chesson 
on the Wolverines’ sideline and 
tried to stay positive. Dever, 
a former wide receiver on the 
team who is now a graduate 
assistant, told Chesson, now a 
fifth-year senior wideout, that 
the breakthrough was coming.

“Man, 
something’s 
gonna 

crack,” Dever told Chesson. “We 
gotta keep pounding. It’ll crack, 
it’ll crack.”

Up until that point, there 

wasn’t 
much 
evidence 
to 

suggest 
Michigan’s 
passing 

game was close to a go-ahead 
score. On the first series of 
the 
second 
half, 
redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight 
threw 
his 
second 

interception of the season. On 
the next two drives, the Badgers 
stopped the Wolverines with 
third-down sacks. And yet 
there were Dever and Chesson, 
already sensing paydirt.

“It had to come,” Chesson 

thought.

Then, midway through the 

fourth quarter, with No. 4 
Michigan still locked in a 7-7 tie 
with No. 8 Wisconsin, Speight 
hit Darboh with a 15-yard slant 
pass on 3rd-and-7, keeping the 
drive alive at the Badgers’ 46. 
Passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch called a play Chesson 
referred to as simply “All 
Goes.”

The pass was supposed to go 

to senior tight end Jake Butt, 
who ran a post over the middle. 
But Speight saw Darboh on the 
weak side, matched one-on-one 
with 
Wisconsin 
cornerback 

Derrick Tindal — who grabbed 
the interception earlier.

“That’s probably the best 

scenario that, as a quarterback, 
I could hear is one-on-one 
with Amara Darboh,” Speight 
said. “I got back at the top of 
my drop and saw that he won 
on his release. And it was still 
solid coverage, so I knew I 
needed to put it in one spot and 

one spot only, and he made a 
great play.”

Redshirt junior running back 

Ty Isaac blocked Wisconsin 
defensive end Alec James long 
enough for Darboh to beat 
Tindal down the sideline by a 
full stride. Speight’s eyes shifted 
from Butt to Darboh. Tindal had 
no help from the safeties.

“You’re just kind of holding 

your breath there the last split-
seconds of the play to see that 
it doesn’t get deflected,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.

Seeing his man wide-open, 

Speight floated a perfect pass to 
Darboh, who snatched it away 
from Tindal and waltzed into 
the end zone. The Wolverines 
won by that margin.

That 
was 
by 
far 
their 

highlight against a swarming 

Wisconsin pass defense, but 
it was enough. Of Michigan’s 
first 12 drives, two resulted in 
touchdowns, and the other 10 
stalled on passing plays — three 
sacks, one interception and 
six 
incomplete 

passes. 
The 

drive 
before 

the touchdown 
ended 
when 

Darboh bobbled 
a pass and then 
dropped it after 
a hit by D’Cota 
Dixon. 
The 

next series was 
redemption for 
Darboh, 
too, 

Michigan’s 
leading 
receiver 

with 87 yards.

“The kid has ice in his veins, 

so he’s very clutch,” Chesson 

said. “He got the game-winning 
touchdown throw, so we’re very, 
very, very lucky to have him on 
our sideline.”

The Badgers sacked Speight 

on third down on each of the 

two 
previous 

drives 
— 
two 

of 
their 
four 

sacks on the day 
— 
and 
before 

that came the 
interception, 
when 
Speight 

threw a low ball 
over the middle 
into traffic and 
Tindal grabbed 
it.

On several other occasions, 

Wisconsin’s aggressive defense 
gave 
Michigan 
problems. 

The 
Badgers 
blitzed 
often 

out of their 3-4 front, and 
the back end of their defense 
swarmed 
to 
the 
ball 
and 

limited the effectiveness of the 
Wolverines’ usual screen and 
crossing routes.

But in the fourth quarter, 

Chesson still felt like Michigan 
was gaining traction against 
Wisconsin’s 
cornerbacks. 

Harbaugh was confident in 
Speight’s ability to throw deep, 
and Darboh liked his matchup. 
The final result validated all of 
their beliefs.

“I was just very excited when 

I saw (Darboh), very excited 
when he caught that touchdown 
because that meant we went up 
by six, made the extra point, up 
by seven, and we’re winning 
the game,” Chesson said. “So it 
finally cracked.”

‘M’ wins second straight, tops Penn State

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
That’s the short version of 

what Michigan men’s soccer 
coach Chaka Daley told his 
team at halftime of Sunday’s 
game against Penn State. It was 
scoreless at the time, but Daley 
sought to convince his team 
success was coming.

“If things are going the 

right way, which they were the 
first half, we just told them 
to stay the course and keep 
going, and goals will come if 
we keep playing the way we’re 
playing,” Daley said. “And more 
importantly, keep competing 
the way we’re competing.”

And the goals did come after 

the half. Michigan (1-4 Big Ten, 
2-6-3 overall) put away two 
chances in the final 45 minutes, 
notching its second straight 
win and first in the Big Ten this 
season by a score of 2-0.

The first goal came early 

in the 63rd minute, when 
freshman 
forward 
Jack 

Hallahan scored from the top 
of the box, finishing a chance 
perfectly into the left corner of 
the goal.

“Honestly, 
it 
was 

overwhelming,” Hallahan said. 
“We needed a goal and I knew 
that we were struggling to get 
a goal. We were at them all 
game and it was just joy, relief, 
everything in one.”

Ten minutes later, Francis 

Atuahene added another to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
tally. 
The 

sophomore forward put up six 
shots, but finally connected with 
a header from senior forward 
Rylee Woods’ high cross that 
came from 30 yards out.

After notching its inaugural 

victory 
Wednesday 
against 

Detroit, Michigan’s momentum 
carried over to Sunday. Early in 
the contest, it forced a fast pace, 
creating a flurry of quality shots 

and — playing to the strength 
of their forwards’ speed — 
exploited Penn State’s (2-2-0 Big 
Ten, 4-5-1 overall) weakness in 
that department.

The Wolverines registered 18 

shots, seven of which were on 
goal, including five in the first 
half alone. The 
total exceeded 
their 
average 

shots per game 
of 16.2, which 
ranked 14th in 
the nation and 
second in the 
Big Ten coming 
into the game.

Michigan’s 

best 
scoring 

chance of the 
first half was in the 42nd minute, 
when Atuahene finished a ball 
off a service from Woods, only 
for the goal to be negated due to 
an offside call.

The Wolverines pressured the 

ball, controlling the possession 
predominantly 
in 
their 

opponents’ half. Any semblance of 
a Penn State offensive stand was 
quickly thwarted and converted 
into a strong counterattack. 
With Michigan’s offense and 

defense working 
cohesively, 
it 

took until the 
81st 
minute 

for the Nittany 
Lions 
to 
get 

their first shot 
on goal — a 
testament 
to 

the Wolverines’ 
stout defensive 
effort.

Senior center 

back Lars Eckenrode credited 
the coaching staff for assembling 
an extensive scouting report 
that pinpointed Penn State’s 
offensive game plan.

“We listened to the coaches, 

we put that into action today, 
and it really showed that as long 
as we listen and have trust in 
our coaches with things that 
they ask of us, then we’ll have a 
tight defense,” Eckenrode said. 
“And we followed through with 
the game plan.”

Daley added that stopping 

midfielder 
Connor 
Maloney 

and forward Dayonn Harris 
— coined Penn State’s “danger 
guys” — was a priority that was 
achieved.

Yet even with the healthy 

two-goal 
cushion, 
the 

Wolverines continued to attack, 
adding three more shots in the 
final minutes.

“We’ve had previous games 

where we’ve been up by two and 
then drew 2-2,” Hallahan said. 
“We knew that we had to grind 
it out and we couldn’t take our 
foot off the gas.”

Wolverines score twice in second half, beat Nittany Lions for first Big Ten win

FIELD HOCKEY
Wolverines fall twice

Coming off a home loss to 

No. 4 Penn State last weekend, 
things were not looking up for 
the Michigan field hockey team. 
Rather, things were looking east.

The ninth-ranked Wolverines 

(2-2 Big Ten, 7-4 overall) traveled 
to the East Coast this weekend for 
a pair of games against two top-
10 teams: No. 8 Maryland (3-1 Big 
Ten, 8-3 overall) and No. 2 North 
Carolina (3-1 ACC, 9-2 overall). 
The team was hoping to add more 
quality wins to its resume, but 
instead found itself disappointed 
and overwhelmed.

Michigan began its weekend 

Friday in College Park with a Big 
Ten battle against the Terrapins. 
The Wolverines got on the 
scoreboard first, when redshirt 
junior Carly Bennett knocked a 
loose ball into the back of the net. 
Michigan continued to outshoot 
Maryland the rest of the half, but 
was unable to score again, and 
went into halftime with a 1-0 lead.

The Terrapins came out of 

halftime strong, scoring eight 
minutes into the half after a penalty 
gave them a corner attempt. Ten 
minutes later, though, freshman 
Meg Dowthwaite notched a goal, 
giving the Wolverines a 2-1 lead.

The lead wouldn’t last long, 

though, as Maryland’s Welma 
Luus knocked the ball in from just 
in front of the cage. The Terrapins 
continued to sustain pressure for 
the rest of the half, and outshot 
Michigan 12-7 in the second 
half. But neither team scored 
again in the half, and the eighth- 
and ninth-ranked teams in the 
country went to overtime.

Overtime 
began 
just 
as 

regulation ended, with Maryland 
dominating 
play. 
Junior 

goalkeeper Sam Swenson made 
three early saves in the period, but 
her heroics eventually came to an 
end. Three and a half minutes into 
the period, the Terrapins knocked 
the ball past Swenson, and the 

Wolverines’ hope for another top-
10 win faded away.

Despite 
the 
disappointing 

result of its match in College 
Park, the Michigan field hockey 
team realized it had another 
game to play, senior midfielder 
Eliza Stein said. The Wolverines 
headed two states south to 
Chapel Hill, N.C., to face off 
against North Carolina. The two 
teams previously met in August, 
when Michigan defeated the 
then-first-ranked Tar Heels, 1-0.

Early on, the Wolverines 

showed signs of repeating their 
performance 
against 
North 

Carolina, with Stein scoring 
unassisted nine minutes into 
the game.

Eight minutes later, though, 

the Tar Heels improved upon 
their earlier performance with a 
tying goal by Eva van’t Hoog. The 
remainder of the half was pretty 
even, with Michigan outshooting 
the home team, 7-5.

“I think we got off to as good of 

a start against UNC as in the first 
game,” Stein said.

The Wolverines were in a good 

position going into the second half 
to score another quality win over 
the Tar Heels. But, it wasn’t to be.

Four minutes into the half, 

North Carolina struck again, 
giving the Tar Heels their first 
lead over Michigan this season. 
Emma Bozek scored off a penalty 
corner, and it didn’t stop there. 
Over the next 30 minutes North 
Carolina scored three more times, 
including twice more off penalty 
corners. A potential marquee 
Wolverine victory quickly turned 
into a blowout, and the Tar Heels 
avenged their season-opening loss 
with a 5-1 demolition.

Michigan now has a reprieve 

from top-10 opponents. Its next 
game is at home against Rutgers, 
and even despite the results from 
this weekend, the team is still 
confident in the rest of the season.

“I think we can still compete for 

a national championship,” Stein 
said. “This doesn’t change that.”

Wolverines off to historic Big Ten start

After a 3-1 win over Maryland 

on 
Sunday, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s soccer team is off to 
its best start in the Big Ten in 
program history. 

“It feels really good,” said 

senior forward Nicky Waldeck. 
“I’m excited about it, but we’re 
gonna keep the same mentality, 
focusing on the next game.”

Michigan (5-0-0 Big Ten, 

9-1-1 overall) came into the game 
with six straight wins and an 
undefeated record at home. The 
Terrapins, on the other hand, 
have 
struggled 
considerably 

this season, winning only one 
game in September and just 
three overall.

Michigan quickly set the 

tempo for the game, dominating 
possession through the first 10 
minutes, and giving Maryland 
few opportunities to score.

With 22 minutes left in the 

first half, the Wolverines broke 
the deadlock. Waldeck, who had 
already generated a couple of 
chances during the half, passed 
the ball to sophomore midfielder 
Jackie White, who scored her 
first goal of the season. 

With this goal Michigan also 

continued its streak of scoring 
the first goal in each of its 
games. 

“It felt really good,” White 

said. “Nicky did all the hard 
work ... all I had to do was to tap 
it in.”

The Wolverines continued 

to dominate play throughout 
the half, but the Terrapins 
still managed to generate a 
dangerous scoring opportunity 
when 
forward 
Chelsea 

Jackson shot the ball just past 
Michigan’s goal.

Two 
minutes 
before 
the 

half 
ended, 
the 
Wolverines 

managed to extend their lead to 

two goals. Sophomore forward 
Reilly Martin drove through 
Maryland’s penalty box, passing 
the ball over to junior midfielder 
Emma Groffsky, who tapped the 
ball into the Terrapins’ net. The 
goal was also Groffsky’s first of 
the season.

Despite 
the 
2-0 
lead, 

Michigan coach Greg Ryan did 
not want to change his team’s 
style of play in the second half.

“We wanted to go after them 

in the second half,” Ryan said.

And a mere five minutes into 

the second half, the Wolverines 
would 
capitalize 
on 
their 

coach’s words. Martin, who 
had assisted on the second 
goal, managed to shoot the ball 
past 
Maryland’s 
goalkeeper, 

extending Michigan’s lead to 
three goals.

While it did seem that the 

Wolverines settled down their 
offensive attack to maintain 
their lead after that point, the 

team still generated a handful 
of chances, including a standout 
attempt toward the end of 
the half by freshman forward 
Brooke DeSantis.

Not until the Wolverines 

changed goalkeepers did the 
Terrapins finally dent their score 
line. After redshirt sophomore 
Sarah Jackson went off, junior 
Megan Hinz gave up a goal on a 
corner kick in the 79th minute.

Despite 
some 
last-

minute 
opportunities 
for 

the Wolverines, neither side 
was able to further alter the 
scoreline, keeping the game at 
3-1 in Michigan’s favor. 

The Wolverines have now 

won seven straight games this 
season, something that Ryan 
attributed to team chemistry.

“This is a team that is very 

positive, and they’re outlooking, 
has a lot of fun playing,” Ryan 
said. “It’s as good as it’s been 
since I’ve been here.”

‘M’ performs well 
at Ohio exhibition

The Michigan rowing team 

set out on the water in Columbus 
this weekend with Olympians 
in the spotlight. With Rio de 
Janerio 
experience 
behind 

both teams in contention, the 
Wolverines scrimmaged Ohio 
State on Sunday, helping them 
to assess their abilities in the 
fall season.

The 
Wolverines 
had 

Olympians to sport, with three 
former 
team 

members 
joining 
the 

coaching staff 
following 
their 
return 

from 
the 

2016 Olympic 
Games. 
In 

the water, the 
Wolverines 
faced 
off 
in 

pairs 
rowing 

against 2016 Olympian and Ohio 
State athlete Elodie Ravera-
Scaramozzino in her Olympic 
event — women’s doubles skulls 
rowing.

Michigan 
competed 
well 

against the Buckeyes, with 
strong performances in the 
race’s 2x4.5-kilometer format 
carrying the team’s momentum 
following last week’s successful 
performance against Eastern 
Michigan.

Since the team’s primary 

competitive season is in the 
spring, this scrimmage allowed 
the Wolverines to gauge their 
performances in a more relaxed 
environment.

While the team’s major races 

in the spring are in boats of 
four to eight athletes, Sunday’s 
scrimmage featured six boats 
with two rowers each and 
three boats of eight rowers. 
The isolated nature of the pairs 
rowing allowed the athletes 

to assess their performances 
closely, allowing for growth 
and 
targeted 
practices 
to 

improve their performances as 
they approach more significant 
meets.

The boats were released in a 

staggered fashion, also known 
as head-style. Because of this, 
the boats could not visually 
compare themselves to each 
other in order to gauge their 
performance and were left to 
race against the clock.

Sunday’s 
conditions 
were 

favorable to the 
Wolverines, as 
they remained 
successful 
under 
sunny 

skies in Upper 
Arlington, 
Ohio, 
as 
the 

duo of Katie 
Wright 
and 

Kendall Brewer 
finished 
first 

overall in the 

pairs races with a combined 
time of 35:52 in the two 
4.5-kilometer races.

While they finished the first 

race with an 18-second lead 
over the Buckeyes’ leading boat, 
their second race finished with 
a closer gap of only six seconds, 
with Ohio State taking second 
again.

Michigan also raced three 

eights 
boats 
against 
one 

Buckeye eights team. Ohio State 
came out on top in the first 
eights race with a time of 15:14, 
but Michigan senior Alexis 
Jones coxed the Wolverines to 
the front of the pack with a time 
of 15:57, finishing eight seconds 
ahead of the Buckeyes’ second 
place boat.

“I thought it went well,” said 

head coach Mark Rothstein. 
“It’s the beginning of the 
season, so it’s early, and there’s 
a lot of development happening 
right now.”
