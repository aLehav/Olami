Students 
and 
faculty 

convened 
Sunday 
in 
the 

Annenberg 
Auditorium 
for 

the 
first 
annual 
WeListen 

fall 
conference, 
a 
day-long 

event focused on maintaining 
open 
communication 
among 

individuals 
from 
different 

political backgrounds.

WeListen, a University of 

Michigan student organization 
aimed at bridging the political 
divide 
through 
bipartisan 

discourse on pertinent political 
issues, 
supports 
healthy 

political discussion rather than 
heated debate.

Co-president 
of 
WeListen 

Nicholas Tomaino, a Public 
Policy 
junior, 
shared 
the 

organization’s goal for the first 
conference.

“Since 
its 
inception, 

WeListen has been advocating 
for a space wherein students 
from all political persuasions 
may talk about the things that 

matter in our civic sphere, ” said. 
“WeListen’s first annual Fall 
Conference will convene 100 
students from the University of 
Michigan to do just that: engage 
in 
dialogue, 
find 
common 

ground and work to bridge the 
American political divide.”

The keynote event featured 

a discussion between Neera 
Tanden and William Kristol 
— esteemed political analysts 

from opposite sides of the 
political spectrum. 

The University of Michigan 

Law 
School 
community 

organized a rally of more 
than 70 students and faculty 

member 
called 
“Respect 

Women, Respect Survivors and 
Respect the Court” Friday in 
support of survivors of sexual 
assault at the conclusion of a 
week highly focused on the 
Supreme Court nominee Brett 
Kavanaugh allegations.

Kavanaugh 
was 

publicly accused of sexual 
assault 
in 
September 

by 
Palo 
Alto 
University 

professor 
Christine 
Blasey 

Ford and Deborah Ramirez. 
The 
confirmation 
hearing 

concluded Friday afternoon, 

after beginning on Thursday 
with 
testimonies 
from 

Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh 
and 
questioning 
from 
the 

Senate Judiciary Committee. 

The University of Michigan 

has appealed a court ruling that 
mandates the University allow 
students 
accused 
of 
sexual 

assault 
to 
directly 
question 

their accuser. The University 
claims the ruling will not only 
discourage 
survivors 
from 

coming forward but will also be 
unfair to students with lower 
incomes.

In the federal Sixth Circuit 

Court of Appeals ruling, the 
court held the University partial 
against students accused of 
sexual misconduct. The ruling 
claimed the University violated 
the due process rights of a 
male student accused of sexual 
assault because it did not allow 
him to directly question his 
accuser.

Deborah Gordon, the accused 

student’s 
attorney, 
said 
the 

University is making exceptions 
for students accused of sexual 
misconduct 
rather 
than 

following their long-standing 
process.

“The 
University 
provides 

everyone 
with 
cross-

examinations except students 
accused of sexual misconduct,” 
Gordon said. “Why would it 
be any different for them? It’s 
a longtime policy, but now 
the University says you can’t 
do that (direct questioning of 
accuser) when you’re accused 
of sexual misconduct … Yet, 
students 
accused 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
have 
the 
most 

severe punishment.”

The 
three-judge 
panel 

ruled the cross-examinations 
can take one of two forms — 
either allowing the accused 
student to directly question 
the accuser or allowing an 
“individual aligned with the 
accused 
student” 
to 
cross-

examine the accuser.

In the court appeal, the 

University found several issues 
with the two options.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

STILL BREATHING

Michigan had to overcome 

a 17-point deficit against 

Northwestern to move 

its winning streak to four 

games.

In an effort to highlight 

the 
current 
scientific 
data 

surrounding medical marijuana 
by 
world-class 
researchers, 

scientists and physicians, the 
first Green Wolverine Science 
Symposium took place Saturday 
at the Ross School of Business — 
ending precisely at 4:20 p.m. 

Student 
organization 

Green 
Wolverine 
arranged 

lectures and panel discussions 
where speakers debated the 
professional 
study 
of 
THC 

and CBD, the active chemical 
ingredients 
in 
marijuana. 

Speakers were given time to 
explain their research and sit 
in on panel discussions where 
audience members asked their 
own questions in response.

Green Wolverine President 

Abigail Kennedy, a Business 
senior, 
emphasized 
the 

informative role the organization 
plays and how this event was 
created to educate students 
and community members about 
scientific features of cannabis.

Following the death of longtime 

economics 
professor 
John 

DiNardo last summer, about 40 
friends, colleagues and students 
gathered in his honor to present 
and discuss a series of 10 research 
papers regarding modern labor 
economics.

The event, hosted by the Ross 

School of Business and Ford School 
of Public Policy, took place this past 
Friday and Saturday. According to 
Paula Lantz, associate dean of the 
Public Policy School, prominent 
economists 
from 
around 
the 

country were in attendance to 
listen in and speak about various 
papers highlighting labor issues 
and policy.

“Some of the most prominent 

labor economists are here,” Lantz 
said. “There’s 10 papers being 
presented and they’re all being 
presented by very well-known 
labor economists working on really 
important policy issues of the day. 
Every presenter is someone who 
worked with (DiNardo), people

While discussing his new 

book “How Democracies Die”, 
co-authored 
with 
Harvard 

professor 
Daniel 
Ziblatt, 

Steven Levitsky, a professor 
of 
government 
at 
Harvard 

University, 
noted 
the 

current 
Supreme 
Court 

nomination 
process 
of 

Brett Kavanaugh. Levitsky 
argued increased political 
polarization will result in 
increased conflict, while 
addressing a crowd of about 
40 students and faculty 
members Saturday on the 
present state of democracy 
in the United States and the 
current 
administration’s 

role 
in 
the 
democratic 

landscape.

“As we grow polarized, 

Americans on both the left 
and the right are willing to 
tolerate abuses against the 
other side,” Levitsky said. 
“Daniel and I had a really 
interesting meeting with 
seven Democratic senators 
earlier this week. One of 
them, 
Michael 
Bennett 

from Colorado, told us, ‘I’m 
quite sure that never again 
will a president without a 
majority in the Senate get 
his or her (Supreme Court 
justice) nomination passed. 
The days of a minority 
president 
nominating 
a 

person to the Supreme Court, 
ever, those days are done.’”

Levitsky 
said 
President 

Donald Trump has contributed 
to the public’s declining faith in 
U.S. government.

“There are things to worry 

about … the impact of his 
discourse is accelerating the 
erosion of the public trust in 
our institutions,” Levitsky said. 
“Same thing with the press. 
An independent media and 
press freedom are essential 
institutions in any democracy. 
And 
Trump’s 
discourse, 

that the media is conspiring 
against him … has accelerated 
the erosion of public trust in 
independent media.”

However, 
 
according 
to 

Levitsky, the United States 
is still in a strong position in 
terms of democratic prosperity.

“U.S. democracy isn’t dead, 

it’s not dying, it probably won’t 
die,” Levitsky said. “Social 
scientists don’t agree on too 
many things, but there are a 
couple of factors they agree 
contribute to the longevity of 
democracy — age and wealth.”

ANN UAL ORGAN CONFE RE NCE RE HE R SAL

A 
recent 
University 
of 

Michigan 
study 
found 
each 

federal dollar the United States 
government spends on the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative leads 
to an extra $3.35 of economic 
activity in the region. These 
results are conclusive through the 
year 2036.

The GLRI was launched in 

2010 and Congress has funded 
over 
$2.5 
billion 
worth 
of 

projects to improve the region’s 
environmental 
concerns. 
The 

economic 
benefits 
were 
not 

initially intended to be part of the 
initiative, but through the GLRI, 
approximately 1,700 new jobs 
in tourism have been created or 
supported.

John Linc Stine, chair of the 

Great Lakes Commission, said in a 
Water Canada article these results 
leave a positive legacy for the area.

“This study describes what we 

already know in facts and figures: 
Cleaning up legacy pollution and 
restoring aquatic habitat on the 
Great Lakes isn’t only good for 
the environment, it creates jobs 
and fuels the regional economy,” 
Linc Stine said. “It’s a positive 
legacy that states and our partner 
organizations can leave for future 
generations. The Great Lakes 
states are ready and excited to 

continue this critical work until 
the job is finished.”

The study also found the federal 

dollars 
increased 
quality 
of 

life throughout coastal areas. 
Housing values improved by 
$1.08 
per 
home, 
an 
overall 

increase of $900 million. GLRI 
was also found to increase new 
real estate development, water-
based recreation, tourism and a 
permanent young population.

Nurses Contract Agreement

The University of Michigan Professional Nurses Council 
reached a tentative 3-year contract agreement with 
Michigan Medicine administrators on Saturday. In 
upcoming weeks, the more than 5,700 Michigan Medicine 
nurses plan to ratify the agreement.

According to the 2017-2018 Sustainability Cultural Indicators 
Program survey, 75% of University of Michigan students, an 
almost 10% increase from 2015, are “extremely sure” climate 
change is occurring. In contrast, a 2017 Yale University survey 
found that 45% of Americans were “extremely sure” 
climate change is real.

Student Climate Change Survey

Doctoral Student Survey

The Rackham Institutional Research office's first Michigan Doctoral Experience 
Study, conducted in 2017 now publicly available , found that 72 percent of surveyed 
students pursuing a master’s in social sciences reported they wanted to teach after 
earning their degrees. In contrast, the study found that only about 43 percent of 
surveyed students pursuing their master’s in the physical sciences or engineering 
reported they wanted to teach after earning their degrees.

On Tuesday, the Zell Lurie Institute at the Ross School of Business announced a 
$100,000 investment from its Founders Fund into organic snack company SMPL. 
SMPL was started by University alum Ellis Fried, whom earned more than $17,000 
in the 2017 Michigan Business Challenge while an undergraduate student.

D.C.’s Chinatown is for tourists

“Do 
you 
even 
have 

Chinese cooks? This tastes 
like cardboard,” my mother 
yelled in Mandarin at the 
poor, unsuspecting waitress. 
She was very unimpressed 
by the food we tried at the 
“authentic” Chinese restaurant 
at Chinatown in Washington, 
D.C. Despite the traditional 
archway 
and 
the 
Chinese 

characters on the signage along 
the streets, there was not much 
authenticity remaining in this 
section of the city.

When I first saw Chinatown 

in D.C., I was so full of 
excitement. I had never lived 
in a place that had a proper 
Chinatown before (well, besides 
living in actual China). I stared 
adoringly 
at 
the 
beautiful 

arches and the zodiac on the 
ground, surrounded by Chinese 
restaurants. I was so eager to 
be around people who shared 
my culture.

Unfortunately, it was all 

largely a facade.

My mom would later look up 

on her Chinese sites where the 
best Chinese food in the area 
was. The answer: Maryland.

In 
the 
20th 
century, 

Chinatown 
in 
D.C. 
was 
a 

bustling center for the Chinese 
community (who notably had 
to live in a segregated enclave 
due to racism). But waves of 
gentrification have pushed out 
much of the Chinese people 
who once lived there to make 
way for office buildings and 
hipster vegan restaurants — 
which actually make a damn 

good soy milkshake, but I 
digress.

The 
remaining 
Chinese 

restaurants 
serve 
highly 

Americanized Chinese food. 
As of 2015, there were only 300 
Chinese-Americans still living 
in Chinatown, down from a 
peak of about 3,000. Across 
Chinatown, instead of actual 
Chinese businesses, there are 
Urban Outfitters and pizza 
spots that put up signage in 
Chinese characters in some 
borderline offensive attempt 

to preserve the culture of the 
area. Sometimes it seems like 
there 
are 
more 
University 

of Michigan graduates than 
Chinese people in this city, 
given how often I see the hats 
and shirts, especially on game 
day.

Every day when I step off the 

metro and walk past the shining 
gates to go to work on the top 
floor of an office building, I 
can’t help but wonder if I’m 
part of the problem. Sure, I 
make less than minimum wage 
and am the only East Asian in 
my office, but I am an outsider 
swooping in, looking for a job 
and eating at the hip vegan 
place.

On 
the 
second 
day 
of 

being in D.C. for Michigan in 
Washington, I walked a mile 
to get to one of the only Asian 
markets in the city. It is a 
Japanese store, so they didn’t 
have the special chili sauce 
I was looking for, but I was 
able to get many of the other 
ingredients that would sit in 
my pantry so I could pretend 
I would actually cook fresh 
Chinese food and not just 
eat two-ingredient salad and 
frozen Trader Joe’s pasta. (I 
have yet to make my mom’s 
favorite noodle recipe that she 
taught me before leaving, sorry 
mom.)

The tiny store was crowded 

with the white-to-Asian ratio 
skewed in the white direction 
— partially because of the 
high density of Asian girls and 
their white boyfriends, who I 
made jokes about to my friends, 
noting the irony given I am also 
dating a white dude.

Gentrification is a major 

problem 
facing 
many 
D.C. 

residents, 
and 
the 
impact 

on 
Chinatown 
is 
only 
a 

fraction 
of 
that 
problem. 

Across 
the 
city, 
minority 

communities 
(especially 
the 

Black community) repeatedly 
get pushed out of their homes 
to make way for a new office 
building, apartment complex 
or Whole Foods. This all occurs 
without attempts to preserve 
the culture of the neighborhood 
or accommodate for the existing 
people, because the new, rich, 
white person needs a place to 
stay and a bougie grocery store 
to go with it — at the expense of 
communities of color.

LYDIA MURRAY

MiC Columnist

On Sept. 15, I attended the 

third 
annual 
Palipalooza, 
a 

Palestine-centered 
concert 
in 

Chicago, on behalf of Learning 
for 
the 
Empowerment 
and 

Advancement 
of 
Palestinians. 

LEAP 
is 
an 
organization 
I 

volunteered with this summer 
that provides Palestinian children 
living in refugee camps south 
of Lebanon with a six-week 
intensive English program to help 
prepare them for the Brevet, an 
English-heavy examination all 
Lebanese students must take to 
go to high school or vocational 
schools. Through LEAP, I had 
the opportunity to connect with 
people 
who 
quickly 
became 

my brothers, sisters and best 
friends. However, not everyone 
gets to witness what the Israeli 
occupation means firsthand and 
see how it affects people they 
love, which is why events like 
Palipalooza are so important.

Palipalooza 
gave 
Palestine-

centered vendors a chance to 
showcase their music, films and 
products. Among the vendors 
was Wear The Peace. Aside from 
providing great conversation, they 
also had fashionable products and 
an inspirational mission. For each 
item of clothing sold, one was 
donated, and 100 percent of the 
money raised from accessories 
was donated to the Helping Hands 
for Relief and Development and 
Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. 
They sold stylish items, some with 
Arabic script, including jewelry 
saying 
“Love” 
and 
clothing 

with the word “Peace,” and they 
used their designs to promote 
resistance through fashion.

Murad Nofal, co-founder of 

Wear the Peace, described, “Me 
and Mustafa [Mabruk] wanted 
to start a movement where we 
can spread awareness and peace 
through clothing and at the same 
time give back to those same 
causes we’re trying to bring 
attention to.” This is one of the few 
companies I have encountered 

where I genuinely knew my 
money was going to help people in 
need, and their political clothing 
items encouraged people to learn 
more, even if only for the sake of 
knowing what they are wearing.

Mary Hazboun, a Palestinian 

folk singer, writer and artist, was 
showcasing cartoons from her 
collection “The Art of Weeping” 
at another table. Hazboun, born 
in Bethlehem, began doodling 
as a way to cope with flashbacks 
and panic attacks that she would 
experience from her time living 
under Israeli military occupation 
and being forced from her home. 
She now uses her artwork as a 
platform to share her narrative 
and resist through her pieces. 
She translates her pain and 
experiences into unique and 
delicate cartoons, often depicting 
women with symbols of the 
Palestinian diaspora like the 
keffiyeh, traditional embroidery 
and the key of return.

“Events like Palipalooza make 

me feel like I am back in Palestine, 
even if it is for a few hours. To be 
around Palestinians and other 
people of color activists & artists 
who use their creative work as 
a form of resistance is crucial 
to highlight how our struggles 
are interconnected,” Hazboun 
reflected. The emotion that was 
so prevalent in every single one 
of her drawings allowed viewers 
to connect to something raw 
and personal that none of us had 
actually experienced.

One of the talents performing 

was Lakota rapper and producer 
Frank 
Waln. 
Waln 
made 

the 
connection 
between 
the 

apartheid in Palestine and the 
ethnic cleansing of his Native 
American ancestors, as well as the 
erasure of indigenous histories 
by the colonial settler, both 
points reminiscent of Mahmoud 
Darwish’s poem, “Speech of the 
Red Indian.” My favorite song he 
performed was “What Makes the 
Red Man Red?” from the classic 
Disney cartoon “Peter Pan.” He 
transformed this racist song and 
countered the stereotypes that 

have been produced since America 
was founded through lyrics like 
“You made me red when you 
killed my people” and “We died 
for the birth of your nation,” both 
of which I feel apply to the current 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He 
also sang a song called “My People 
Come From the Land,” which 
fought back against attempts by 
Americans to erase the natives’ 
connection 
to 
the 
country, 

describing the land as open for 
the settlers to come, occupy 
and “civilize.” This parallels an 
argument used by Israelis today. 
Waln’s final call was to tell the 
audience not to let what happened 
to Native Americans happen again 
to the Palestinians, encouraging 
us to fight back against injustice 
and not let history repeat itself. 
Waln’s music showed viewers you 
don’t need to be Palestinian to 
show solidarity in what is unjust 
because everyone has experience 
with and can recognize injustice.

When I was asked to drive 

to Chicago so close to the start 
of the new school year, I was 
a little hesitant. However, the 
opportunity to meet all of these 
strong 
and 
talented 
people 

who were so connected to their 
identities made the trip more than 
worth it. It was beautiful to see 
different communities showing 
up in support of Palestine, and it 
made me realize you don’t need 
to have a personal connection 
to relate to the struggle of a 
people oppressed. The solidarity 
and coalition building shown 
at 
Palipalooza 
is 
something 

I hope to see reflected more 
often in the coming school year, 
and we are already off to an 
admirable start with the practice 
of the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions Movement shown by 
Associate Prof. John Cheney-
Lippold in declining to write a 
recommendation letter for a study 
abroad trip in occupied Palestine. 
As a student body, we should take 
after Cheney-Lippold and refuse 
to be bystanders complicit in the 
human rights abuses carried out 
by Israel against Palestinians.

Palipalooza: centering the Palestinian cause

I have been learning the 

English language for 15 years 
now. I have improved from 
learning vowels to now writing 
in a second language. Fifteen 
years is long enough to have 
mastered a skill, yet there are 
still some words in English I 
can never pronounce.

Veggie patty, water, letter
Whenever I need to use 

these 
words 
in 
my 
daily 

conversations, my brain enters a 
panic mode because it will need 
to choose between sounding 
like an American or like who 
I am. I learned in Linguistics 
210 the first semester of my 
freshman year that these are 
called flaps or taps. It refers 
to the way the tongue has to 
somehow touch the alveolar 
ridge, but not quite. Some days 
I can do the American flap or 
tap pronunciation, so ordering 
water at restaurants becomes 
less daunting. Most days I can 
never pronounce veggie patty 
even though it’s the same way 
of pronouncing water. Perhaps 
the flap comes with practice 
because I have certainly said 
the word water a lot more than 
the word veggie patty. Some 
days I just avoid the word and 
eventually, I become a master 
of synonyms — not because of 
spending hours with thesaurus, 
but because of avoiding words 

(so “mail” instead of “letter”).

Mitten, kitten, badminton
I can make myself learn flaps, 

but never these contractions. 
It goes against my natural 
instinct to just disregard the 
letter between ‘t’ and ‘n.’ In 
my first language, we never 
hide letters. They are there, 
and we vocalize them. What 
is it with these Americans and 
contractions? It gets so much 
more 
absurd 
in 
discussion 

sections of highly technical 
courses. “Moniring” instead 
of ‘monitoring’ or “wachh-a-
say” instead of “what did you 
say.” When I come to the U.S., I 
struggle with how I tell people 
my name. To these Americans, 
my name is a foreign word. Some 
of my friends have names that 
can sound foreign. My name is 
not like that. Arabs will try to 
say my name the Arabic way 
but I am not Arab, even though 
my name is. It is complicated 
but I like to think my name and 
me are a cultural juxtaposition. 
I also struggle in discussion 
class because I need a few 
minutes to gather my thoughts 
and choose “affordable” words. 
This often takes way too long 
and by the time I have come 
up with my thoughts, the 
discussion has moved on to a 
new topic. It must be nice to 
have an American tongue. How 
seamless it is for them to speak 
in discussion class without the 
risk of sounding like a toad.

These pronunciations don’t 

bother me as much anymore 
because I am not much of a 
talker anyway. No one needs 
to hear me talking and then 
after a few minutes realize 
I have foreign tongue. Yet 
what bothers me is the way 
in which my tongue has been 
Americanized to some extent. 
I am American enough in my 
thoughts and how I dress, so I 
cannot afford to lose my accent 
as well. Then one day, after 
reading Chimamanda Ngozi 
Adichie’s “Americanah,” I came 
across the video “We Should 
All be Feminists.” One African 
accent lead me to the movie 
“Queen of Katwe” to Filipino 
co-workers. There is something 
about their pronunciation of 
English 
words 
that 
makes 

me attracted to them. It is in 
the way they are sort of just 
boasting 
confidence 
with 

their version of the English 
language. In their own version 
of cultural juxtaposition, I have 
found I do not need to pass off 
as American to be in the U.S.

So I began becoming proud 

of saying my name, the way I 
know how. Not the American 
way or the Arabic way, but 
the Malaysian way, and every 
time during discussion class I 
can only wait for my American 
graduate student instructor to 
ask me the second time how to 
pronounce my name because it 
is so foreign to them.

What are you: ambiguously brown

A foreigner on foreign wordings

Walking into one of the many 

bodegas on Mt. Pleasant Street in 
Washington, D.C., I’m instantly 
greeted in Spanish by the cashier. 
Without hesitation, I respond in 
Spanish, but I am not Latino. The 
first time I walked into what would 
become my regular barbershop on 
Georgia Avenue, the man yelled 
for someone to “take care of the 
light-skinned guy”, but I am not 
black. In the elevator at University 
Towers last year on my way to 
work out, a woman tapped me on 
the shoulder and made me turn 
around and take out my earbuds 
only to ask “Excuse me, are you 
Ethiopian? I’m Ethiopian”. Mostly, 
I find these events entertaining, 
happy that I can function as a 
racial and cultural chameleon.

On the other hand, meeting a 

white person for the first time, the 
following conversation is standard 
procedure:

Them: “Where are you from?
Me: “D.C.”

Them: “No, but where are you 

really from?”

Me (no hesitation): “D.C.”
Unlike the interactions in the 

previous paragraph, these leave 
me emotionally drained. Some are 
confused by this; why should an 
exchange in which a white person 
inquires about my race be more 
exasperating than one in which a 
person of color assumes it?

The key difference is intent, 

whether conscious or not. When 
another person of color identifies 
(or in my case, thinks they 
identify) someone of the same 
race, it’s an instant connection- 
finally seeing a familiar face in a 
sea of white ones; someone with 
whom you can actually relate and 
don’t have to tone down, or be 
apologetic about, your culture. 
This fosters inclusion. On the 
other hand, when a white person 
meets a person of color, and their 
first instinct is to seek out that 
person’s racial or ethnic identity, 
that is a form of direct exclusion. It 
means that they see that person as 
different than themselves and are 

seeking a tangible way to ‘other’ 
them. More than that, it is seeking 
to categorize you and fit you in a 
neat box that doesn’t conflict with 
that person’s worldview. I tend to 
interrupt preconceived notions of 
race for many people because I’m 
mixed in a way that doesn’t neatly 
fit into any one box.

The point of writing this, if 

there is one, is to say one thing, 
specifically 
to 
white 
people: 

stop. If my racial background 
is something I care to tell you, 
or if it’s relevant, I will share it 
with you. Otherwise, don’t ask. 
It’s exhausting and a constant 
reminder that society is seeking 
to exclude me due to the color of 
my skin, and unnecessary for most 
conversations. Initially, I thought 
I’d conclude with my actual 
ethnic background, but upon 
reconsideration I figured to do so 
would be counterintuitive to the 
point of this piece. I am a racially 
ambiguous brown American, and 
unless I decide otherwise, that’s 
all you need to know.

Three inches from the top
One inch from the sides

Margins are the parts of the

Outside the limit of what is

Outside the limit of the green 

line we found

Who is not important
Palestinians living in East 

Jerusalem

Where a stone’s throw and a 

Jewish mother affords you

Better 
housing, 
cleaner 

streets and the chance to live

Beyond survival
In 
the 
basement 
of 
an

At the end of a room
Sat a man who was not a man
He 
was 
an 
immaterial 

country

The wounds of a conflict
The mat of an oppressive 

government

No
More than a man
He was a voice
With 
the 
Jewish 
Israeli 

trumpet of triumph ringing in 
my ear

I sat and I listened
And I listened and I sat
And I remained still as the 

sand on a beach

While this tide of a man
Who was really a voice
Forced me from my position
And into the rocks of his 

truth

“This is a national struggle”
The voice said
And suddenly the Palestinian 

was not a resisting citizen but a 
rebelling nation

The Palestinian is one-third 

of the Jerusalem municipality

But 12 percent of the budget’s 

burden

In the West Bank he is 

neither citizen nor resident

He is a number
A statistic
A terrorist
The Palestinian is
the wrong color
The wrong religion
The wrong language
He is one inch from each side
Surrounds the main body of 

Israel 

Is outside the wall
A margin
I did not pity the voice
Because it was strong
But I pitied his listeners
because it was alone
Like a tune arranged for a 

mass choir

We heard just the tenor
Or maybe a soprano
But for us to understand the 

lyrics

We must complete the choir
And sit and listen some more

I 

used to dread the first day of 
school. I didn’t dread it because 
it meant that summer was 
ending and that I’d soon spend my 
evenings doing homework rather 
than relaxing. It was because 
teachers 
never 
pronounced my 
name right. Before I started going by 
Krystal, I went by my non-American, 
phonetically spelled (yet somehow 
still difficult to pronounce) name that 
I won’t write here because I know no 
one will be able to pronounce it.
The first day of school, I always 
had to listen to the teachers blunder 
through my name before I corrected 
them with the entire class watching 
me. Same with substitute teachers 
— my classmates would laugh as the 
teacher would try to say my name. Of 
course, I’m not blaming the teachers 
for not being able to pronounce my 
name. We both felt embarrassed as 
we became a spectacle. I know I can’t 
expect people to properly pronounce 
my name if they don’t speak the 
language from which my name 
originated.
I was reminded of this trauma 
after hearing about two recent 
celebrity interviews. Chrissy Teigen 
recently revealed on “The Tonight 
Show” (after being prompted by 
host Jimmy Fallon) that contrary to 
popular belief, her name is actually 
pronounced “tie-genn,” instead of 
“tee-genn.” She said of her name: “So, 
correct is Tie-genn. Do I want people 
to call me that? Not really, because 
then only half are going to do it. And 
then, would we want my dad to be 
happy?” Ariana Grande also recently 
said on Beats Radio, “my grandpa said 
‘grand-eee.’” They then discussed 
how 
her 
grandfather 
changed 
the pronunciation to “grand-eee” 
most likely to make it sound more 
Americanized. However, neither of 
these women has ever corrected the 
public for saying their names wrong, 
and only discussed the way in which 
they say their names when prompted 
to do so.
Hearing Teigen and Grande 
discuss their names led me to think 
about how I used to feel correcting 
people about the pronunciation of 
my name. Often times, I felt that 
correcting them made no difference 
— all correcting them essentially 
did was teach them the formal 

mispronunciation of my name. When 
substitute teachers would butcher 
my name and excitedly ask if they 
pronounced it right, I always said yes. 
Honestly, I don’t think I would have 
been so uncaring about how people 
pronounce my name if I didn’t hate 
the way that my name sounded in 
its formal American pronunciation. 
I thought that it sounded too whiny 
and nasally and it made me dislike 
my name and cringe whenever 
someone would address me by it, so 
really, it didn’t matter to me whether 
or not anyone pronounced it in the 
formal way: Either way, they would 
be wrong.
However, in high school, I 
decided to go by the name Krystal 
after realizing I didn’t have to 
continue listening to my name being 
butchered in various ways. I chose 
“Krystal” because it was a name 
that everyone knew how to say, yet 
I knew that I wouldn’t become one 
out of a sea of many Krystals, as what 
sometimes happens to people with 
common names such as Emily or 
Alex.
Sometimes, I feel guilty about 
having changed my name, as if 
I’m abandoning my heritage or 
dishonoring my parents by rejecting 
the name that has defined me for 
so many years. However, when I 
remember the discontent I felt when 
I heard my name being butchered for 
so many years, I don’t feel as sorry. I 
think of it more as protecting my name 
from being tainted by so many bad 
memories of it being mispronounced, 
time and time again.
Interestingly enough, many of my 
friends protested when I told them 
about my choice to go by “Krystal.” 
They told me they didn’t like the name 
“Krystal,” and some of them even 
made it a point to not call me “Krystal” 
even when referring to me when with 
other people. While I understood 
some people would not like the name 
“Krystal,” I found it confusing some of 
my friends thought they were entitled 
to define me in the way they wanted, 
rather than in the way that I wanted. 
Perhaps it was confusing for them 
to understand why I would want to 
go by an entirely new name; but then 
again, they were the same people who 
unknowingly made me hate my name.
In a similar vein, when I studied 

Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” 
in high school, my English teacher 
told us in the middle of discussion 
she calls one of the main characters, 
Ikemefuna, by “Ike”, a nickname 
I believe she coined herself. Most 
of the other students followed her 
and started calling the character 
by that nickname, too. However, I 
always thought it was a bit insulting 
to “Americanize” his name in such 
a way without his consent. While 
Ikemefuna is a fictional character, and 
people give other people nicknames 
quite frequently, the sole purpose of 
calling him “Ike” was to make our 
lives easier. “Ike” wasn’t a nickname 
borne out of affection but of pure 
laziness about saying four extra 
syllables.
Knowing what I know now 
about how to pronounce Grande and 
Teigen’s last names, I’m unsure about 
where to proceed. I don’t want to be 
complicit with the same laziness that 
changed Ikemefuna to “Ike” in my 
English class. Do I start saying their 
names the way they’re supposed to 
be pronounced? The logical answer 
is yes — but there’s inevitably going to 
be people who haven’t watched their 
respective interviews who are going 
to believe that I’m mispronouncing 
their names and think that I’m a 
complete dunce.
Perhaps a better question to ask 
is what Grande or Teigen would 
prefer people to do. Because it’s their 
names, they’re ultimately the ones 
who should have a say in how we 
refer to them. Just as I exercised my 
power over my name by changing it 
to Krystal despite some of my friends’ 
opposition, they too should be the 
ones who get to decide how their 
names are said. While Teigen said she 
doesn’t want people to pronounce her 
last name the way that it’s supposed 
to be pronounced, Grande was less 
clear about how she wants people to 
say her last name. It’s possible that 
she doesn’t have a clear preference 
— and that’s fine, too —as long as it’s 
clear that she’s the one who rightfully 
has the power over how others 
pronounce her name.

The scourge of online trolling
T

he United States has a long 
history of disinformation. 
One of the first major 
manipulations of the media took 
place in 1782 when Ben Franklin 
oversaw the publishing of an entirely 
fake issue of the Boston Chronicle. 
Printed on the pages of the issue was 
an incendiary story about the scalping 
of 700 colonists by Native Americans 
meant to generate sympathy among 
British citizens for the plight of 
Americans.
However, 
the 
contemporary 
perpetrators of “fake news” are 
capable of far more harm than 
anything 
the 
founding 
fathers 
could have imagined (or concocted 
themselves). With the immense 
volume of data and ease of accessibility 
provided by the internet, bad actors 
are now able to have an exaggerated 
influence on public opinion. Keeping 
the internet free for everyone while 
simultaneously controlling the effects 
of disinformation is a balancing 
act, but ultimately we all as digital 
citizens have a responsibility to be 
aware of the myriad of online threats 
and its consequences.
We know that disinformation 
is nothing new, but how exactly 
did it come about on the internet? 
The pioneers of this new breed 
of digital content are known as 
“trolls,” invoking the mean-spirited 
mythological creature that taunts 
its victims from under a bridge. 
According to Data & Society, a 
research institute that focuses on 
the social and cultural impact of 
data in the modern world, a troll is 
defined as someone who deliberately 
baits people to elicit an emotional 
response. Trolls started to pop up in 
the early 2000s on internet message 
boards such as the website 4chan, 
where anonymous users can post 
content consisting of simple words 
and pictures.
It was primarily on these 
anonymous 
platforms 
that 
the 
malicious side of trolling took shape. 
Though many trolls claim to be 
apolitical — simply trolling for the 
“lulz,” as they like to call it, the reality 
is trolling is skewed much more 
toward “alt-right” viewpoints. For 
example, the users of 4chan’s /b/ sub-
board use deliberately offensive hate 
speech to create an emotional impact 
on their targets. As opposed to the 
moralistic, sometimes smug political 

correctness and affinity for fairness 
supported by the left, trolls bring 
out the worst in toxic white rage, 
meninism, nativism and similarly 
twisted views about vulnerable 
groups that slip through the cracks of 
“alt-right” ideology.
The effects of trolling are not 
limited to sub-boards, though, and 
in the past few years mainstream 
conservatives have adopted the 
highly sensational tactics of trolling 
to appeal to voters. From the first 
moments of Donald Trump’s 2016 
campaign, when he rode down the 
escalators to announce his candidacy 
and said of Mexicans, “They’re 
bringing drugs. They’re bringing 
crime. They’re rapists. And some, I 
assume, are good people,” his speech 
had all the hallmark elements of 
trolling.
Back then, people still thought 
that Trump was running to highlight 
the hypocrisy of the political elite. 
Yes, he was running for office from 
an official standpoint, but very few 
people thought he was serious. This 
represents a key trolling tactic of 
preserving ambiguity called Poe’s 
Law, an internet adage that asserts the 
difficulty of distinguishing between 
sincere expressions of extremism 
and satire of extremism. Therefore, 
trolls theoretically always have the 
moral authority of challenging the 
establishment, as Trump positioned 
himself so many times on the 
campaign trail, rather than simply 
engaging in hateful discourse.
Unfortunately, 
armed 
with 
hateful rhetoric and their own 
version of moral justification, a very 
visible sub-species of trolls (shall 
we call them ogres?) emboldened 
by online trolling behavior has 
come to dominate today’s political 
discourse. 
In 
a 
country 
that 
supposedly 
champions 
liberal 
values, the most valued content in 
our online atmosphere proves to be 
sensational and damaging. Websites 
such as Twitter and Facebook are 
struggling to curtail the effects of 
racist, misogynistic and xenophobic 
accounts, most of which are run 
by foreign actors or fake bots 
designed to algorithmically post 
inflammatory statements. In 2017, 
Facebook reported up to 3 percent 
of its accounts were fake, totaling 
60 million “users” not associated 
with a real person. The internet, and 

social media sites in particular, are 
predisposed to promote content that 
attracts attention, yet a consequence 
of this is the promotion of sensational 
messages that sow discord and harm.
Because the natural tendency of 
the internet is to guide users toward 
attention-grabbing 
sensationalism, 
we need creative solutions to 
take back control of our online 
spaces. There have been attempts 
at pulling the policy lever on this 
issue, such as legislation passed by 
the French Parliament that allows 
courts to remove fake news during 
election periods. However, when 
governments or companies gain 
the authority of censoring online 
content, it creates a slippery slope; 
one that may ultimately lead to the 
infringement of our first amendment 
rights in the United States.
Instead, the way to combat 
disinformation is to make users 
more digitally literate. Students 
have it drilled into them since 
middle school that they need to use 
credible sources for their essays, but 
this warning should go beyond the 
classroom. Let us make it a personal 
responsibility for everyone to be 
conscious surfers of the web. This 
can be done without limiting the 
freedoms of any individual user, 
while also impacting their choices of 
who and what to interact with online. 
For example, qualified professionals 
in schools could teach online safety, 
content evaluation and personal data 
protection that may help students 
make better choices. Structuring 
these courses in the same way as drug 
and alcohol awareness or consent 
education seminars would be a good 
first step toward promoting more 
responsible internet usage.
The internet is the biggest 
playground in the history of human 
civilization, and every playground 
has its bullies. But through education 
about disinformation, fake news and 
trolling behavior, it is possible to give 
each internet user the resources they 
need to function in this complicated 
ecosystem. 
A 
more 
educated 
populace will lead to a safer internet 
for all and provide a chance to reverse 
some of the negative consequences of 
unlimited information.

I

’ve sat through my classes in 
the past weeks and watched 
as students halfheartedly took 
lecture notes while they streamed 
hearing after hearing on their 
laptops, like a melancholy version 
of March Madness. I listened to 
my peers chat about each new 
development in the fleeting minutes 
before professors start lecturing, the 
conversations no longer dominated 
by, “So, did you do the reading?”
By 
Thursday, 
we 
felt 
overwhelmed, hopeless and unable 
to focus in our classes. We asked 
each other in hushed voices, “Do 
you think we’ll talk about Brett 
Kavanaugh today?” But we didn’t. 
I’m in four political science classes 
this semester. Only one of my 
professors has taken time to talk 
about Kavanaugh, let alone ask his 
students’ concerns on the matter.
Our professors tell us time and 
time again that our department 
is one of the best in the world. But 
how can that be true if we neglect 
to discuss what is quite possibly the 
most controversial political event 
of our lifetime? We weren’t alive for 
Anita Hill. We are the generation 
that brought discussions of rape 
culture on college campuses to the 
forefront. We marched for those 
of us brave enough to share their 
stories of survival, and we continue 
to stand by the courageous women 
who decide to share their stories. We 

watched as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford 
cried during her testimony, and so 
many of us cried with her. So why did 
so many of our professors neglect to 
acknowledge the mere existence of 
this entire situation?
I understand we cannot discuss 
every pertinent current event in class. 
I understand we must draw the line 
somewhere. But this isn’t where we 
should draw that line. Regardless of 
what students or professors believe 
about the validity of Ford’s testimony, 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation process 
has already had profound political 
implications.
This process has been the ugliest 
political battle many of us have ever 
seen. It speaks to growing political 
polarization. It speaks to lack of 
representation in Congress, as 11 
white men neglected to speak to a 
survivor of sexual assault, yet had no 
issues yelling at their colleagues in 
defense of another white man.
It even speaks to political theory: 
Is it a just separation of powers if one 
Republican senator votes against 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation and Vice 
President Mike Pence casts the tie-
breaking vote? Was that outcome 
the intent of the Framers, seeing as 
they wrote our Constitution so that 
the vice president was the runner-
up in the presidential election? 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation process 
has already had real repercussions 
for political science, and I’m sure 

more will come in the coming weeks. 
That, in and of itself, is worth talking 
about.
But outside of the ways in which 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation applies 
to our curriculum, our professors 
should take time to discuss the 
situation for a separate reason 
entirely. Because at the end of the 
day, we’re still students. Maybe we 
don’t get it all, or maybe there’s a 
side of this entire debacle that we’re 
neglecting to consider.
In the one class where my 
professor did take time to ask if we 
had questions or concerns, it sparked 
not only an intellectual conversation 
between students, but also a string 
of thought-provoking questions that 
the students asked our professor. 
The professor’s voice will always be 
louder, stronger and wiser in these 
discussions. To my professors: You 
are so much more likely to change 
our minds than we are to change 
each other’s. I don’t doubt that we’re 
getting one of the best political 
science educations in the world. 
But you also owe us an education 
that takes time to discuss what is 
unfolding in front of our eyes. So, let’s 
start talking.

at 
an 
inflection 
point. 
Allegations of sexual assault 
have stalled Brett Kavanaugh’s 
nomination to the court, casting 
uncertainty over an appointment 
that 
only 
weeks 
ago 
seemed 
contentious but inevitable. The 
allegations have attracted more 
media scrutiny to the Senate’s 
upcoming floor vote on Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation, but the controversial 
nomination featured intense debate 
and partisan divide long before these 
accusations surfaced.
The 
Republicans’ 
mostly 
unwavering 
support 
and 
the 
Democrats’ 
steadfast 
opposition 
to 
Kavanaugh 
underscore 
the 
importance of this appointment, 
which is perhaps unparalleled in its 
potential to mold the future of the 
Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh is slated to replace 
Anthony 
Kennedy, 
who 
was 
arguably the Court’s only true 
moderate. Kennedy was nominated 
by President Ronald Reagan but 
semi-regularly sided with his liberal 
colleagues on social issues to provide 
the pivotal vote on cases that dealt 
with gay rights, abortion, affirmative 
action and capital punishment. 
Kennedy’s retirement likely leaves 
Chief Justice John Roberts as the 
court’s swing vote, but aside from 
a few notable defections, Roberts 
has voted reliably with the court’s 
conservative 
bloc 
throughout 
his tenure. The confirmation of a 
solidly conservative jurist, such as 
Kavanaugh, would tilt the court 
decidedly to the right, allowing 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
and 
congressional 
Republicans 
to 
legislate with less concern of being 
rebuffed by the Supreme Court.
In the near future, the court 
could have to rule on a variety 
of consequential and politically-
charged issues, including whether 
a sitting president can be indicted 
or whether a president can pardon 
himself. These decisions carry 
momentous 
legal 
and 
political 
implications, and they demand a 
high court without a visible partisan 
divide. Unfortunately, the Court’s 

ideological divide seems to only be 
growing wider.
An 
increasingly 
politicized 
Supreme Court is not a positive 
development. 
Roberts 
famously 
likened the role of the justices to 
calling “balls and strikes,” but it is 
difficult to agree with this view 
when Supreme Court votes become 
as predictable and consistent. As 
an institution, the Supreme Court 
works best when its justices serve 
as impartial umpires, but in reality 
they have political and ideological 
motives that are masked by their 
chosen judicial philosophies. These 
biases influence the cases they 
choose to take, the way they vote and 
the timing of their retirements.
Amid the current prospect of 
a majority-conservative Supreme 
Court for the foreseeable future, 
many on the left have called for 
institutional reform to the Supreme 
Court and the judicial branch in 
general. These proposals include 
establishing judicial term limits, 
packing the court or even electing 
justices. Ultimately, none of these 
proposals will work, because the 
problem with the Supreme Court is 
not institutional but ideological.
The institution of the Supreme 
Court has functioned with varying 
degrees of effectiveness since its 
inception. Its early relationship 
with the other branches was 
acrimonious. After coming to power 
in the elections of 1800, Thomas 
Jefferson and his fellow Democratic-
Republicans sought to curb the 
influence of the judiciary, which 
they considered to be biased in favor 
of their Federalist rivals. Jefferson’s 
Congressional 
allies 
took 
the 
unprecedented step of impeaching 
a Supreme Court justice, Samuel 
Chase, on grounds of political bias. 
Chase was acquitted by the Senate 
and he remains the only Supreme 
Court justice ever impeached.
Chase’s acquittal reaffirmed the 
court’s independent authority for 
most of the 19th century, though 
the court occasionally found its 
authority questioned or ignored 
when it waded into politically-
contentious 
issues 
like 
Native 

American tribal rights and slavery. 
The court’s legitimacy was next 
tested in the 1930s, after President 
Franklin Roosevelt proposed to 
pack the court after it overturned 
several of his New Deal reforms. 
Despite 
Roosevelt’s 
widespread 
popularity, his plan failed and the 
court remained at nine justices. 
Curiously, 
the 
court 
reversed 
course and upheld several pieces of 
New Deal legislation, including the 
Social Security Act, National Labor 
Relations Board and minimum 
wage laws, perhaps sensing their 
political vulnerability despite the 
failure of Roosevelt’s court-packing 
scheme.
In the decades that followed, the 
Supreme Court stayed relatively 
above the political fray. The court’s 
unanimous decision in U.S. v. Nixon 
led to clean, minimally partisan end 
of the Nixon saga. Nominations to 
the court, with a couple exceptions, 
usually 
enjoyed 
overwhelming 
bipartisan 
support. 
Antonin 
Scalia, a staunch conservative, was 
confirmed unanimously, as were 
John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day 
O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a solidly 
liberal justice, was confirmed 96-3, 
and even the first two of President 
Barack Obama’s nominees enjoyed 
some Republican support.
However, the Supreme Court 
appears to now be sliding back into 
the partisan fray that it has avoided 
for so many years. The Senate’s 
politically-motivated refusal to even 
hold hearings on Merrick Garland’s 
nomination 
in 
2016 
ensured 
Supreme Court appointments for 
the foreseeable future will be heated, 
partisan affairs. Furthermore, the 
elimination of the filibuster on 
Supreme Court nominations in 2017 
essentially removed any need for a 
president’s nominee to have cross-
party appeal.

Seven or eight years ago, 

when it looked like AMC’s quiet 
prestige period drama “Mad 
Men” was onto something, a 
bunch of network execs picked 

up the phone, presumably barked 
“’60s!” to whoever was on the 
line and we were all treated to 
some of the most disastrous 
television ever, in the form of 
“Pan Am” and “The Playboy 
Club.” NBC’s “This Is Us” is the 
latest TV powerhouse to inspire 
such a response, though none as 
transparent as ABC’s “A Million 
Little Things,” which might as 
well be called “Hey, This Is Also 
Us!”

“A Million Little Things” is 

the story of four friends who 
met while trapped in an elevator 
on the way to a Bruins game. 

Jon (Ron Livingston, “Band 
of Brothers”) is the glue of the 
group, a successful businessman, 
devoted husband and Harvard 
graduate who takes it upon 
himself to spout such nuggets of 
wisdom as, “Everything happens 
for a reason,” and “Friendship 
isn’t one big thing, it’s…” — can 
you guess? — “…a million little 
things.”

Rome 
(Romany 
Malco, 

“Weeds”), an aspiring filmmaker, 
is happily married to a talented 
restaurateur 
but 
privately 

struggles with depression. Gary 
(James Roday, “Psych”) is a 
sardonic breast cancer survivor 
who picks up women at survivor 
support groups and takes them 
on first dates to funerals. And 
then 
there’s 
Eddie 
(David 

Giuntoli, “Grimm”), a guitar 
teacher who lives perhaps the 
most tragic life of all, desperately 
trying to escape his marriage to 
a (shudder) lawyer, who works 
long hours and sometimes needs 
him to pick up their son from 
daycare. Oh, the horror! Sorry, 
bud, someone has to pay for the 
Bruins tickets.

Rome, Gary and Eddie are 

stunned when they learn that Jon 
has committed suicide. Jon’s own 
mantra, “Everything happens for 
a reason,” keeps coming back 
to haunt them. He was strong, 
successful and happy, with loving 

friends and family, so what could 
possibly be his reason? Here’s 
where “A Million Little Things” 
veers into dangerous territory. 
Rather than accept that Jon 
might have been in pain for a 
long time or that people are more 
complicated than we see them 
to be, everyone quickly searches 
for reasons. Was it because Jon’s 
wife was unfaithful? Does it have 
anything to do with a mysterious 
business deal?

And then the show quickly 

arrives at the most odious 
conclusion of all: Maybe it took 
Jon killing himself for everyone 
to come to terms with their own 
problems. It presents suicide 
as romantic or necessary or 
beneficial to other people, when 
it’s none of those things. And of 
course, the whole thing is neatly 
wrapped in montages set to 
“Riptide” by Vance Joy and “Both 
Sides Now” by Joni Mitchell. 
(ABC, you leave Joni out of this!)

There’s a very strong case to be 

made that “This Is Us” also leans 
hard on emotional manipulation 
of its audience. But somehow it 
works. The narrative twists are 
earned. The emotional punches 
are mostly well-crafted. And the 
entire show is so nicely acted 
that every character feels real 
and worthy of our empathy. “A 
Million Little Things” just can’t 
pull that off. Which is perfectly 

understandable; 
it’s not easy — even 
Dan 
Fogelman, 

who 
created 

“This 
Is 
Us,” 

couldn’t replicate 
its 
winning 

formula 
in 
the 

widely-panned 
“Life 
Itself.” 

Not to mention, 
getting people to 
empathize 
with 

Boston 
hockey 

fans is a very tall 
order.

The 
biggest 

crime 
a 
show 

like 
“A 
Million 

Little 
Things” 

commits 
is 
to 

assume that the 
audience watching 
it is stupid. No 
one 
watched 

“Mad 
Men” 
for 

cigarettes 
or 

upholstery 
or 

gin 
martinis. 

We 
watched 
it 

because it told a 
story about deeply 
complicated 
people struggling 
to make sense of 
a volatile world. 
It was a show that 
never thought its 
interesting setting 
was a substitute for 
scrupulous writing 
and 
delicious 

emotional payoffs. 
And people don’t 
watch 
“This 
Is 

Us” 
for 
crying 

and death — in 
fact, many of us 
enjoy 
it 
despite 

its schmaltz. Pro 
tip: If you’re going 
to rip off a show, 
at least bother to 
figure out what 
made 
the 
show 

work in the first 
place.

‘A Million Little Things’ 
is just one giant disaster

TV REVIEW

MAITREYI ANANTHARAMAN

Daily Arts Writer

ABC

The opening of any concert 

season is an exciting event. This 
past week’s University Musical 
Society 
season-opener 
was 

particularly thrilling. The hall 
was abuzz with energy, with 
student and longtime subscribers 
lined up all the way out the door 
to witness the performance. 
The Philadelphia Orchestra was 
on hand to deliver a masterful 
performance of two staples of 
the repertoire and an inspired 
performance of a new addition. 

The first piece on the program 

was Nico Muhly’s “Liar, Suite from 
Marnie,” an orchestral suite from 
Muhly’s new opera premiering on 
Oct. 19 at the Metropolitan Opera. 
The 
piece 
featured 
frequent 

staccato passages in the lower 
woodwinds and strings along 
with longer melodic material in 
the upper strings. The opening 
was 
energetic, 
immediately 

grabbing the audience’s attention. 

After 
about 
five 
minutes, 

however, this idea began to tire. 
Short bursts from the basses 
and cellos did little to sustain 
the fading energy. The work was 
at its best in the long melodic 
passages that pervaded the rest 
of the work. Overall, however, 
it could never reach the frantic 
energy of the opening measures 
— as the piece continued a quick 
glance around the hall would 
reveal the audience becoming 
increasingly disengaged as the 
piece continued.

As a taste of Muhly’s upcoming 

opera, the work was promising. 
His ideas were fresh and his use of 
accented notes in the lower strings 
was unexpected and intriguing. 
The trading of long melodic notes 
between woodwinds and strings 
was quite lovely. But one hopes 
that the pacing and structure of 

Muhly’s opera is less predictable 
than that of the “Suite.” 

The second piece on the 

program 
was 
Tchaikovsky’s 

“Violin Concerto in D Major” 
with soloist Lisa Batiashvili. 
From the very first notes of 
the Tchaikovsky, the orchestra 
seemed more comfortable with 
the music. This was clearly the 
type of playing that they do 
all the time, and they did not 
disappoint. The soloist made 
even the most complicated of 
passages seem simple, and as her 
playing increased in intensity, 
the orchestra matched her step-
by-step. 
The 
audience 
could 

not help but applaud the end of 
the first movement though two 
movements were still to come. As 
conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin 
pointed out, this would have 
been standard practice during 
Tchaikovsky’s time.

The following two movements 

were similarly magnificent. The 
orchestra and soloist played with 
a level of intensity that demanded 
attention from the audience — it 
was impossible to sit passively 
throughout 
the 
performance. 

The finale, in particular, was 
breathtaking. 
Batiashvili 

possesses an effortless ability to 
take even the most difficult of 
passages and make them seem 
effortless. She soared above the 
orchestra, 
the 
upper 
strings 

responding to her every move 
and echoing her in kind. Nézet-
Séguin and Batiashvili clearly 
enjoy working together, as they 
frequently smiled at each other 
and responded to each other in 
kind throughout the work.

After five minutes of applause 

following 
the 
piece, 
Nézet-

Séguin and Batiashvili offered a 
brief encore with Nézet-Séguin 
accompanying 
her 
from 
the 

piano. 
Nézet-Séguin’s 
piano 

playing was surprisingly delicate 
and subtle — though he conducts 

with large, sweeping gestures 
his piano playing was relaxed 
and gentle. Given that he will be 
returning in Dec. to accompany 
Joyce DiDonato in a recital of 
Schubert’s “Winterreise,” it is 
clear that Nézet-Séguin is equally 
as comfortable at the piano as he 
is on the podium.

The concert finished with a 

performance of Rachmaninoff’s 
“Symphonic Dances.” Combining 
energetic rhythms and simple 
melodic 
material, 
this 
was 

Rachmaninoff’s last and arguably 
best work. Nézet-Séguin lead an 
aggressive interpretation of the 
work, emphasizing the complex 
rhythms and jarringly simple 
melodic material. Yet even with 
this 
aggressive 
interpretive 

angle, the orchestra did not lose 
momentum as they had with 
the Muhly. They brought a fresh 
vitality to the work, something 
that I have not heard in many 
other performances of it. Though 
musicality 
in 
some 
passages 

was replaced by brute force, the 
overall effect was compelling. 

The end of the performance 

was 
met 
with 
a 
near-

instantaneous standing ovation. 
And after five minutes, the 
orchestra 
responded 
to 
the 

cries of “encore” with a surprise 
performance of “The Victors.” 
Nézet-Séguin had been wearing 
a white shirt with shoulder pads 
and mesmerizing purple sequined 
shoes, and as he returned to 
the stage wearing a Michigan 
baseball hat, he encouraged the 
audience to clap and sing along. It 
was a fun ending to the night and 
an encouraging sign of what was 
to come this concert season. As 
the audience left the auditorium, 
the excitement was palpable. The 
Philadelphia Orchestra had more 
than lived up to expectations, 
and it is up to the next ensemble 
to match the intensity that they 
brought to this season opener.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Last week, my popular horror 

class 
was 
discussing 
“Dear 

David,” a ghost story told last 
year via Twitter by Adam Ellis. 
“Dear David” is presented by 
Ellis as being a true story that 
he experienced in person. One 
of the criticisms brought up was 
the idea that while Ellis provided 
many forms of evidence that his 
apartment was being haunted 
— 
audio 
files, 
photographs, 

diagrams and videos — there was 
no piece of evidence that couldn’t 
have been faked or made up. 
Therefore, his ghost story was 
not to be believed.

Personally, 
I’m 
always 

naturally hesitant to say that 
I don’t believe something. I’d 
probably never commit to saying 
I don’t believe in ghosts, or 
most other things some people 
consider to be incredulous, even 
though I can’t confidently say I’ve 
met a ghost myself. I’m not sure I 
would recognize a ghost if I came 
across one — I might brush it off, 
attach some other explanation 
to it, or miss it completely — and 
if I can’t say I’d recognize a real 
one, then I can’t fairly say I’d 
know when I’m seeing a fake 
one, either. Similarly, I don’t 
consider myself religious, but 
I’ve never committed to saying I 
don’t believe in God or any kind 
of higher power.

I didn’t think too much 

more about the “Dear David” 
discussion until a couple of 
days later, when I was talking 
with someone else about the 
Kavanaugh hearing. The hearing 
has dominated the news for the 
last week, and particularly the 
last few days, with questions 
arising of Kavanaugh’s conduct 
on the stand, the demonstrability 
of Ford’s account of Kavanaugh 
sexually 
assaulting 
her 
and 

credibility on both ends. The 
person 
with 
whom 
I 
was 

speaking essentially said that 

they didn’t believe Ford, because 
she could technically have been 
lying. There was no evidence 
that indicated with absolute 
certainty, without a shadow of 
a doubt, that Kavanaugh had 
assaulted her. Therefore, she 
shouldn’t be believed.

This flippant dismissal of Ford 

stuck out to me, in part because 
it reminded me so much of the 
“Dear David” discussion. Is 
that really our national default 
when it comes to sexual assault? 
Assessing it against the same 
metrics we’d use to pick apart a 
ghost story?

The issue of lacking evidence 

has been brought up often over 
the course of the hearing, just as 
it’s often brought up when people 
are 
discussing 
“fantastical” 

claims such as accounts of 
encounters with ghosts and 
aliens. It’s true, in the case of the 
Kavanaugh hearing, that with 
little decisive physical evidence 
on both ends, a lot of the case 
is a matter of he-said, she-said. 
Many of our perceptions come 
down to what we do know: For 
instance, that Ford has passed a 
polygraph test while Kavanaugh 
hasn’t even taken one, and that 
three other women — Deborah 
Ramirez, Julie Swetnick and one 
anonymous woman — have also 
accused Kavanaugh of sexual 

assault or misconduct.

It can’t be proven definitively 

that Kavanaugh did assault Ford. 
But one of the many differences 
between the Kavanaugh hearing 
and ghost stories like “Dear 
David” is that one has a definite 
bearing on the future of our 
nation. With Kavanaugh up for 
a position of authority that he 
may hold for the rest of his life, 
a position that will have a drastic 
influence on the direction of our 
country, we as a nation need 
to carefully consider ideas of 
credibility. According to news 
sources including Slate, Vox 
and Esquire, Kavanaugh lied 
repeatedly and plainly while he 
was under oath.

I’m hesitant to discount ghost 

stories and religion because I 
don’t want to commit myself to 
a narrow-minded perspective, 
simply because the evidence 
isn’t concrete enough for me. I 
think the nation should avoid 
committing itself to a Supreme 
Court Justice who has proven 
willing to bend and break basic 
courtroom practices, such as 
answering 
questions 
directly 

and 
truthfully, 
to 
suit 
his 

purposes. The issue at stake 
right now isn’t whether or not 
Kavanaugh is going to be sent 
to prison; it’s whether powerful 
figures are willing to look past 
the possibility of him assaulting 
someone far enough to give him a 
lifetime Supreme Court seat.

Sexual assault survivors are 

not ghosts. They’re not aliens. 
If we approach their consistent 
and measured testimony with 
the same skepticism we bear 
while discussing a ghost story, 
we tell the world that to the 
United States, the stories of Ford, 
Ramirez, Swetnick and other 
survivors are just that: stories. 
An important decision is to be 
made as a result of this hearing — 
let that not be it.

Credibility, ghost stories 
and Christine Blasey Ford

it’s a wonder that she’s still 
functioning at all.

It’s hard not to view The 

Lamb as the conclusion to some 
unwritten 
bildungsroman, 

but West has been careful to 
clarify that things aren’t so 
clear cut. For now, there may 
not be a definitive end point 
in her journey from addiction 
to sobriety. This sentiment 
is encapsulated in a single 
lyric on “Water Over Sex,” 
the album’s second single, 
where West delicately croons, 
“You think I’m good well I 
want to be gooder.” This is 
characteristic of her lyrical 
style, where communication 
— if sometimes extremely 
oblique — takes priority over 
correctness and blunt honesty 
comes through in both diction 
and delivery.

Lala Lala’s first release, 

Sleepyhead 
(2016), 
was 

recorded 
as 
a 
three-piece 

— guitar, bass and drums. 
For The Lamb, West and co. 
break out the synths and 
the drum machine in a big 
way. 
The 
introduction 
of 
 

“Water Over Sex” feels like 
something out of Porches’s 
Pool 
(2016), 
and 
“Dove” 

shimmers 
with 
a 
warbly, 

aquatic glow punctuated with 
harsh, 
emotive 
harmonies. 

Where the guitar tone across 
Sleepyhead 
is 
brilliantly 

chunky, The Lamb’s is much 
cleaner 
and 
shares 
more 

melodic responsibility with 
the synthesizer.

For all the differences from 

its 
predecessor 
— 
which, 

according 
to 
a 
Bandcamp 

piece on Lala Lala, West 
“doesn’t even consider … a real 
album” — The Lamb holds onto 
the same forward energy that 
made Sleepyhead a standout 
debut. 
West 
consistently 

discovers hooky, ostensibly 
obvious melodies in places 

you’d 
think 
had 
already 

been drilled dry. The Lamb 
also 
finds 
West 
seriously 

exploring her upper register 
for the first time. Opener 
“Destroyer” 
might 
be 
the 

best example, where she sings 
“You are the reason my heart 

broke behind my back” in a 
downward cascade that starts 
higher than she ever sang on 
Sleepyhead and ends in her 
most comfortable range, talk-
singing plainly but forcefully.

On the same day of the 

album release, Lala Lala put 
out a video for “Scary Movie,” 
The Lamb’s ninth track. In 
it, a couple takes turns flying 
a kite on the beach as skips 
and imperfections in the film 
flash upon the screen. The 
man and woman in the video 
are West’s parents, and the 
film taken before West was 
born, though she discovered 
it only recently. Nostalgia 
flows freely from the video, 
while West’s troubling lyrics 
float above: “Spilling blood 
is ugly / Unless I know it’s 
mine,” “This knowing leads 
to horror / There’s hands 
around my neck.” Captured 
here is the ultimate conflict of 
The Lamb, where sweetness, 
love, protectiveness and a 
desire to keep getting better 
are all at war with paranoia, 
anxiety, violence and fear of 
abandonment.

When all’s said and done, 

West doesn’t have any clear 
answers for us. What she 
presents is a raw, thoroughly 
unpretentious reflection on 
being an imperfect human. 
One who lies, who sometimes 
drinks too much, who is hurt 
and hurts, who wants to be 
“gooder” but doesn’t always 
have the energy to do so, or 
even know how. One who, at 
the end of the day, still needs 
to eat. The Lamb is a bold but 
sure second step for West, and 
one that points to a bigger and 
better future no matter what 
the past may have held.

Catch Lala Lala at the 

Loving Touch in Ferndale, 
MI on Friday, Nov. 23rd with 
WHY? and the Ophelias.

I was first exposed to Lillie 

West’s Lala Lala project just 
over a year ago. The Chicago-
based group — a three-piece 
on tour — was opening for 
Surf Curse at Marble Bar in 
Detroit, and their set featured 
visuals that were produced 
and projected live on a drop-
down screen above the band. 
The image was just “Lala 
Lala” tiled across the screen 
with 
various 
effects 
and 

filters applied — relatively 
simple stuff — but the display 
hinted at an enthusiasm and 
willingness 
to 
create 
and 

explore 
different 
ways 
of 

presenting a project. It was 
technically 
a 
“multimedia” 

performance, I suppose, but it 
felt counterintuitively raw and 
unpretentiously DIY.

I later had the privilege 

of seeing Lala Lala open for 
Frankie Cosmos, but before 
then caught one of Lala Lala’s 
bassist Emily Kempf’s other 
projects opening for the D.C.-
based Flasher. The project, 
called Dehd, is a collaboration 
between Kempf and NE-HI 
guitarist-vocalist Jason Balla. 

Balla, in turn, releases solo 
material 
under 
the 
name 

Accessory, and put out the 
excellent Blue Tape at the end 
of this past summer. Seeing 
Dehd — their raw energy, 
movement 
on 
stage 
and 

incredibly hooky guitar riffs 
— and recognizing Kempf was 
actually what prompted me to 

revisit Lala Lala. When I did, 
I was delightfully surprised 
and, wanting more, I began my 
descent down the rabbit hole 
of this particular nook of the 
Chicago indie scene. There I 
discovered 
the 
connections 

between 
these 
artists 
and 

more: 
Melkbelly, 
Whitney, 

Twin Peaks, Post Animal, 
Grapetooth — the list goes 
on. It’s not all that surprising 
that these people know each 
other, but the amount of 
collaboration 
and 
support 

that 
exists 
between 
them 

is impressive and uniquely 
heartening.

The 
Lamb, 
Lala 
Lala’s 

second album and first since 
West made the decision to 
go 
sober, 
seems 
in 
some 

ways a manifestation of the 
camaraderie that exists within 
the scene and between West 
and other friends. Anxiety and 
paranoia, to which West says 
her sobriety has contributed, 
also perfuse the album. On the 
record’s penultimate cut, West 
sings “Keep my friends safe 
keep my friends close / Keep 
my friends safe night and day 
/ Keep my friends safe now 
and always.” Titled “When 
You Die,” the track functions 
as a prayer, one in which West 
has taken the phrase “live 
every day like it might be your 
last” to heart. When she’s not 
around to protect those close 
to her, she has to make sure 
someone is.

It’s important to note that 

West’s paranoia is far from 
unwarranted. While writing 
the album, she suffered more 
than one personal loss, and 
an intruder broke into her 
home. “I wish Herc hadn’t 
died, I wish I hadn’t gotten 
robbed,” she sings on “I Get 
Cut.” Compounded by her 
adjustment to sobriety and 
the stress inherent in being a 
young, independent musician, 

‘The Lamb’: A lot has changed for Chicago’s Lillie West

Michigan avoids near-devastating loss to Wildcats

EVANSTON — Shea 

Patterson and the Michigan 
football team’s offense stepped 
onto the field with 10:05 left in 
the game.

The 14th-ranked Wolverines 

(4-1 overall, 2-0 Big Ten) had 
struggled all night on that side 
of the ball, especially in the 
first half, when they fell into a 
17-0 deficit on the road against 
Northwestern (1-3, 1-1). And 
after halftime, when Patterson 
and company did string together 
some positive plays, they 
struggled to punch it in the 
endzone, settling for two field 
goals from inside the 10-yard 
line.

With that, Michigan’s 

offense faced a 17-13 deficit and 
an opportunity to reverse its 
fortunes.

On the first play of the drive, 

Patterson found fifth-year 
senior fullback Jared Wangler 

for nine yards. Patterson hit 
redshirt junior tight end Zach 
Gentry for 13 yards on a corner 
route on the next set of downs, 
then he scrambled for a key 
third-down conversion after 
that.

Patterson then put the 

Wolverines in striking position 
when, on second-and-10 from 
the Wildcats’ 28, he threaded a 
pass through three defenders to 
Gentry, who fell to the ground at 
the six-yard line. Senior running 
back Karan Higdon completed 
the comeback two plays later, 
plowing into the endzone for 
a five-yard score with 4:06 on 
the clock, as Patterson wildly 
pumped his fist behind him.

Michigan’s defense took it 

from there, snuffing out any 
Northwestern late-game heroics 
and finishing off a nail-biting 
win, 20-17.

“A lot of guys really left it out 

there, you know, played their 
hearts out,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “Tested in the 

ball game and had to show what 
we were made of. And (I) like 
what we’re made of.”

Despite the happy ending for 

the Wolverines, the rest of the 
game was surely not how they 
drew it up.

After building momentum 

with three, dominating wins in 
the last three weeks, Michigan 
came in heavy favorites against 
the Wildcats, who were fresh off 
losses to Duke and Akron.

With that, when the 

Wolverines won the opening 
coin toss, they opted to receive 
in an effort to seize momentum 
from the jump.

But their first drive 

went three and out, and 
Northwestern responded with a 
56-yard drive for a touchdown. 
7-0.

On the next possession, 

Michigan went three and out 
again, and the Wildcats drove 
back down the field to kick a 
field goal. 10-0.

The Wolverines’ third drive 

started to build momentum, but 
a key drop on a would-be big 
play by junior tight end Sean 
McKeon ended that threat, and 
Northwestern’s offense went 
straight into the endzone again. 
It was 17-0 with 12:56 left in the 
second quarter.

Michigan’s offense had 21 

yards at that point. The Wildcats 
had 145.

The Wolverines scored on 

a 4-yard run from Higdon on 
the next possession for a much-
needed response, but they still 
went to halftime down 17-7.

“Just keep pushing. Keep 

pushing,” Higdon said. “You 
know, there’s four quarters for 
a reason, and that first half they 
were up, and we remembered a 
lot of the adversity we faced over 
the summer. You know, summer 
workouts and stuff like that, and 
we dug deep, and we came out 
with a win.”

Added Harbaugh, on his 

halftime message: “I mean, what 
you’re made of. Can you dig 

down and, you know, continue 
to execute and execute better 
than what you did? So, yeah, it’s 
self-explanatory. Do you have 
the metal? Got the gravel in your 
gut to win a game on the road 
under tough circumstances? I’m 
proud of our guys.”

Michigan’s defense, 

especially, seemed to take that 
message to heart.

Northwestern gained a total 

of 51 yards in the entire second 
half. It went 1-for-6 on third 
downs. The Wolverines sacked 
Wildcats quarterback Clayton 
Thorson five times in the final 
30 minutes. Four of them were 
on third down, and the other 
one was the last play of the 
game, when junior linebacker 
Josh Uche brought down 
Thorson on a would-be Hail 
Mary attempt.

And most importantly, 

Northwestern didn’t score 
another point.

“Coming out (of halftime), we 

knew they couldn’t really hang 

with us,” Uche said. “We (were) 
just having a lot of self-inflicted 
wounds. Went into the locker 
room, got our minds right, came 
back and dominated like we’re 
supposed to.”

For a while, though, it looked 

like the offense didn’t have 
enough.

But when Michigan needed 

it most, the unit, and especially 
Patterson, came through.

In front of a road crowd that 

was half-filled with Wolverines 
fans, Patterson ended things 
with a fist pump after his 
signature drive to this point in a 
Michigan uniform — in a game 
that wasn’t supposed to need 
one.

“I can’t even describe it,” 

Patterson said. “It’s such an 
exhilarating feeling, and you 
know, that’s why you play the 
game. You play the game for 
these moments, and like I said, 
man, I’m just proud to be a part 
of this team and help out any 
way I can.”

Winovich is the voice of the defense
B

efore 
the 
season 
began, the 
week of the 
Notre Dame 
game, Chase 
Winovich was 
dealt some 
unexpected 
bad news.
After a 
season in which he led the 
Michigan football team in 
sacks, tackles for loss and 
fumble recoveries, Winovich 
was one of the unquestioned 
leaders on the Wolverines’ 
defense which finished third 
nationally in total defense.
He saw himself as a leader 
too.
So, when Michigan 
announced its captains, 
voted on by the players, 
and Winovich wasn’t one of 
them, he was understandably 
disappointed.
“That one stung a little bit,” 
Winovich said that week, on 
Aug. 28, before giving some 
context. “But at the end of the 
day, when you think about it, 
I came back to win a national 
championship. 
I didn’t come 
back to win 
a popularity 
contest, so, you 
know, it’s on the 
board. That’s 
all I’m gonna 
say. My role as 
a leader is still 
the same. I woke 
up that day, was 
not the captain. 
I woke up the next day, was not 
the captain. End of the day, it’s 
out of my hands. So I’m moving 
on.”
He said that last part while 
mimicking wiping his hands 
clean. Perhaps he was telling 
the truth. His play has only 
gotten better from last year’s 
coming-out party — captaincy 
or not.
Winovich is tied for the 
most tackles for loss in the 
nation through five games this 

season. He once again leads 
the Wolverines 
in sacks, and 
he is second 
on the team in 
tackles, behind 
linebacker 
Devin Bush.
He is the 
workhorse of 
Michigan’s 
defense, and 
that was never 
more obvious 
than in the Wolverines’ 
win over Northwestern on 
Saturday.
Winovich led Michigan with 
nine tackles, eight of which 
were solo and three of which 
were for losses.
He practically lived in the 
Wildcats’ backfield all game 
long, breaking through their 
line so often you couldn’t help 
but notice his dominance.
“The ends, I think 
Chase had one of his better 

ballgames,” said Michigan 
coach Jim 
Harbaugh after 
the game. “Just 
the way he was 
flying around 
and hustling all 
night. I mean, 
play after play 
after play after 
play.”
Winovich’s 
production 
obviously 
helped the Wolverines in their 
emotional, comeback win. And 
after every game like that, 
there are questions asked and 
stories told about sideline 
or locker room interactions 
that fired up a team or an 
individual player.
On Saturday night, 
Winovich was the subject of a 
few stories.
“Chase is a character, and 
he’s a tremendous leader 
on this team,” said junior 

quarterback Shea Patterson. 
“All he’s gotta 
do is look at 
you, and you 
know what 
he’s saying. He 
sparked a fire in 
me in the locker 
room and on the 
field in the third 
quarter. That 
helped me out 
a lot.”
“I told a lot 
of the guys when we were 
down, I looked each person in 
the eye, because I didn’t want 
the message to be dispelled,” 
Winovich said. “I said, ‘This 
is the part where we double 
down on all the hard work 
we’ve done. All the preparation 
that we’ve gone through. And 
they can’t take this from us.’ 
Even when we were losing I 
said that. It was our game. It 
was nothing they could do. But 
I’m just so fired up about that 

game, and it feels great.”
Another story 
that popped 
up was from 
practice last 
week.
On Thursday, 
Winovich spoke 
to the defense 
in an effort to 
inspire them for 
a game that may 
have looked like 
a cakewalk.
“I said, you know, ‘It’s in 
a sense their season, and it’s 
our season.’ ” Winovich said. 
“You know, we lose this game, 
who knows how that affects 
our chances at the playoffs 
and a Big Ten Championship. 
And for them, this would have 
been the greatest night of their 
lives. And obviously we spoiled 
that.”
It might seem odd to hear 
these stories of Winovich’s 
leadership from Winovich 

himself. For many people, that 
would make the stories less 
believable.
But Winovich isn’t a 
bullshitter. He’ll call an 
opponent’s offense predictable 
after a game if he feels that’s 
the case. He’ll tell you candidly 
that he was hurt when he 
wasn’t named captain.
There was one more bit of 
truth from Aug. 28.
After a question about his 
offseason and the progress he 
had made, Winovich started 
by mentioning the tools he’s 
added and credited strength 
and conditioning coach Ben 
Herbert. Then he finished with 
a prediction.
“It’s gonna be fun,” 
Winovich said. “That’s all I’m 
gonna say about this season. 
Yeah, it’s gonna be fun.”
In hindsight, that almost 
looks like foreshadowing. 
Winovich had fun on Saturday. 
His team did too.
“It was electric,” Winovich 
said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever 
experienced a Michigan locker 
room that was that — like, the 
juice was flowing through 
everyone from the coaches to 
the managers to 
the equipment 
staff. It was 
going through 
everyone.”
Part of that 
can be credited 
to Winovich, 
who has stayed 
true to his word 
that his role has 
not changed. He 
has dominated 
on the field and done his best 
to inspire his teammates.
Winovich didn’t win the 
popularity contest at the 
beginning of the year. But 
he’s moved on from that. The 
reason Winovich came back 
— his national championship 
goals — are still in play. And 
Winovich is leading the push.

‘M’ suffers from frequent penalties

For 
yet 
another 
season, 
Michigan is one of the country’s 
most penalized teams in 2018. 
Teams have accepted an average 
of 9.2 infractions for 84.2 yards 
per game against the Wolverines 
— 13th and 15th worst nationally, 
respectively.
That’s up nearly three penalties 
a contest from 2017, marking the 
third season Michigan ranks 
below average in the category 
under coach Jim Harbaugh.
Yellow 
flags 
were 
again 
plentiful for the Wolverines in 
their come-from-behind victory 
at Northwestern on Saturday. 
Michigan was called for six 
penalties in the first half, their 
effects compounded by the costly 
moments in which they came.
Facing 
third-and-long 
early in the second quarter, 
Northwestern threw a fade to the 
endzone, looking to capitalize on 
a man-to-man matchup between 
David Long and receiver Bennett 
Skowronek. The junior corner fell 
behind the route, however, and 
was forced to grab Skowronek to 
prevent an easy touchdown. Long 
was called for pass interference, 
setting up a punch-in score for the 
Wildcats two snaps later.
Junior corner Lavert Hill was 
flagged for a hold later in the 
second quarter, as he and Long 
struggled against Northwestern’s 
quick passing plays and slants 
early. Thorson completed nine of 
his first 11 passes.
But 
perhaps 
the 
most 
momentum-thwarting 
penalty 
was a false start by redshirt 
junior tight end Zach Gentry late 
in the second quarter. Looking 
for points before heading to the 
locker room, Gentry jumped on 
fourth-and-three, 
forcing 
the 
Wolverines to bring on their 
punting unit in Wildcat territory.
While 
Michigan 
adjusted 
both its discipline and play in the 
second half, those errors were far 
from confidence-inspiring. As 
nearly 16-point favorites in front 
of a split crowd, the Wolverines 
were expected to cruise through 

Saturday.
They showed they could have 
with 
20 
unanswered 
points 
to finish the game. But those 
penalties and self-inflicted errors 
created Michigan’s razor-thin 
margin for error.
It was also the second horrid 
defensive start on the road for the 
Wolverines in as many tries. A 
month ago, Notre Dame jumped 
out to a 21-3 lead after now-backup 
Brandon Wimbush torched the 
Wolverines secondary. Penalties 
had their roll then, too. Junior 
safety Josh Metellus was ejected 
after a targeting call on the game’s 
second drive.
Khaleke Hudson has become 
all 
too 
familiar 
with 
that 
controversial player-safety rule. 
For the second consecutive week, 
the junior VIPER sat out the first 
half after targeting penalties the 
week prior.
Fans, meanwhile, will point 
to a questionable penalty that 
didn’t go the Wolverines’ way. On 
a zone-read in the fourth quarter, 
senior 
running 
back 
Karan 
Higdon was penalized for a hold 
Harbaugh said was a “phantom 
call.”
“I asked for it specifically just 

to make sure they didn’t come 
back later and say it was some 
other player,” Harbaugh said. 
“They called it on 22, they called 
it on Karan, so I asked the referee, 
‘Go ask the side judge who he 
called it on.’ So there wasn’t some 
different explanation days from 
now.”
Fifth-year 
senior 
defensive 
end Chase Winovich also said he 
was “baffled” by what he thought 
were a litany of missed holding 
penalities against Northwestern’s 
offensive line. 
Officials make mistakes. It’s 
part of college football. Many of 
those mistakes happened to not 
benefit Michigan on Saturday.
But it doesn’t discount a 
worrying trend. Penalties, for yet 
another week, proved numerous 
and detrimental. And as the Big 
Ten slate heats up, it could be 
only a matter of time before they 
culminate in another loss for the 
Wolverines.
“We’ve got to make it clear that 
there were no penalties, so there’s 
no grey in-between for the refs 
to throw that flag,” said junior 
linebacker Josh Uche. “Like I 
said, it was self-inflicted stuff, but 
we adjusted.”

Next generation of Michigan defense emerges

As the Michigan football 
team 
mounted 
its 
largest 
comeback 
in 
the 
Jim 
Harbaugh era Saturday against 
Northwestern, fans saw a team 
clawing for its season. They saw 
an offense do just enough, led 
by a quarterback who showed 
guile and resolve.
They also saw a defense 
show a prolonged glimpse into 
what the future holds on that 
side of the ball. 
Junior 
Josh 
Uche 
and 
sophomore 
Kwity 
Paye, 
in 
particular, asserted themselves 
in career-best days. Uche and 
Paye — dubbed as two of the 
players expected to fill the 
shoes of fifth-year senior Chase 
Winovich and junior Rashan 
Gary — notched two sacks each. 
Their contributions proved 
game-altering 
against 
the 
Wildcats. 
“Like I said, talked about it 
at halftime,” Harbaugh said. 
“We were being tested, this 
is time to find out what we’re 
made of. And our guys really 
responded.”
Though 
oft 
regarded 
as 
hard-working 
players, 
stubborn about taking even one 
play off, Gary and Winovich 
intentionally 
cede 
time 
in 
practice to get Paye, Uche and 
others more reps.
“Rashan 
and 
Chase, 
in 
practice, make sure I get my 
reps, make sure I know what 
I’m doing,” Paye said Saturday. 
“They 
quiz 
me 
sometimes 
on what I’m doing in those 
situations.”
The writing is on the wall, 
with 
Paye 
specifically, 
to 
ascend into a a more regular 
role next season. Gary and 
Winovich know it. Paye does, 
too.
The sophomore has been 
operating in practice at both 
the “end” side and “anchor” 
side, 
taking 
all 
the 
reps 
Winovich and Gary relinquish. 
It’s made Paye — a natural edge 
pass-rusher — a more well-
rounded 
defensive 
end, 
he 
says, but remains a challenge 
nontheless.

“I 
think 
(defensive 
line 
coach Greg Mattison) knows 
those guys are getting ready to 
leave,” Paye said last week. “So 
I feel like he’s trying to prepare 
me to try and eventually take 
over, eventually fill those spots. 
But as of right now, I’m just 
trying to contribute.”
But it’s not only about the 
future.
Given that opportunity to 
contribute Saturday, with Gary 
in and out of the lineup due to 
injury, Uche and Paye made the 
most of the present, too.
In the fourth quarter, with 
the defense needing to get 
off the field on third down, 
Paye 
noticed 
Northwestern 
quarterback 
Thorson 
drifting to his left with the 
pocket eroding. Showing his 
athleticism, 
Paye 
exploded 
right at Thorson, finishing 
with vigor for a 10-yard sack, 
his second on the day. 
Uche, touted as a potential 
up-and-coming 
pass-rushing 
force for years now, seems to 
finally be emerging into just 

that. He earned two sacks of 
his own by dipping his shoulder 
and sneaking past the tackle, 
the latter of which ended the 
game.
As 
Harbaugh 
rattled 
off 
names of guys who impressed 
after Saturday’s game, Uche 
and Paye neared the top of the 
list multiple times.
“Josh Uche, some of those 
speed rushes he had on the 
edge were huge,” he said. … 
“And also Kwity Paye, thought 
he really stepped up.”
Then again later.
“Kwity Paye, also showed 
up, as I said, Josh Uche,” he 
said again. “Two of those speed 
rushes went fast and powerful.”
When Harbaugh mentions 
a player off-hand, that alone 
merits note. He, along with 
Mattison, will undoubtedly be 
finding more ways to get the 
duo on the field. Perhaps that 
means sliding Gary inside on 
some downs. Maybe it means 
resting the banged-up Gary in 
lower-leverage spots. It could 
just mean a more frequent 

rotation in general.
These are good problems to 
have.
That these questions even 
need to be asked speaks well 
to the depth up front, and the 
future of the defense. And 
it wasn’t restricted to Paye 
or 
Uche. 
Freshman 
Aidan 
Hutchinson 
continues 
to 
demand playing time on the 
defensive 
line. 
Sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 
Michael 
Dwumfour played his best 
game in a Michigan uniform. 
Sophomore 
linebacker 
Josh 
Ross made several key plays, 
including a thumping pass-
breakup on a third down in the 
second half. The list could go 
on.
Saturday’s 
game 
will 
be 
remembered in several ways. 
A late comeback on the road. 
A quarterback finding a way. 
A game that was closer than it 
should’ve been. 
But perhaps the most lasting 
memory? The emergence of the 
next generation of Michigan’s 
defense.

Northwestern’s blitz too much for Wolverines

Heading into Friday night, 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team may have anticipated 
that Northwestern’s backline 
would give the Wolverines the 
most trouble.
The Wildcats’ defense had 
surrendered just five goals 
over the first 11 games of the 
season, and thanks to brick-
wall 
goalkeeper 
Mackenzie 
Wood, seven of those games 
were shutouts.
On 
Friday 
though, 
Michigan’s 
demise 
came 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
rapid 
offensive onslaught, as No. 17 
Northwestern (2-2-1 Big Ten, 
8-2-2 overall) defeated the 
Wolverines in Evanston, 4-1.
A lot about Friday’s game 
was unusual.
For 
starters, 
Michigan 
(2-3-0, 
6-6-0) 
outshot 
the 
Wildcats, 7-6, in the first half 
of the game—the same frame 
Northwestern saw all four of 
its goals scored. The Wildcats 
hadn’t scored four goals in a 
game in two seasons.
The first three goals came off 
corner kicks, as Northwestern 
jumped on opportunities when 
they were able to create set-ups 
and slow the game down.
“I 
think 
it 
came 
down 
to attention to details, and 
they capitalized on us,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein. 
After a contentious first 10 
minutes that saw somewhat 
sloppy play characterized by 
midfield turnovers from both 
sides, Northwestern began to 
differentiate itself.
At 
the 
10:45 
mark, 
the 
Wildcat players crowded the 
box on their first corner kick 
of the game, drawing the 
Wolverine defense inside. This 
left 
Northwestern 
forward 
Brenna Lovera open on the 
outside to smash the ball into 
the top of the net, opening up 
scoring in the game.
The Wildcats wasted little 
time, striking again under six 

minutes later. Northwestern 
capitalized 
on 
another 
set 
piece opportunity, this time 
with a header from defender 
Kayla Sharples, putting them 
ahead, 2-0.
Almost 
immediately, 
Michigan 
responded 
with 
smart passing up the pitch 
from senior midfielder Ashley 
Calcagno to redshirt junior 
midfielder Katie Foug. After 
fighting off a defender, Foug 
crossed the ball to sophomore 
midfielder Alia Martin, who 
sent the ball in to cut the 
Wolverines’ deficit in half.
“I think our ability to come 
back and score, we had great 
control of the ball in the run-
up play, we moved it really 
nicely, creating good chances,” 
Klein said.
Over the course of the next 
15 
minutes, 
Northwestern 
tacked 
on 
two 
additional 
insurance goals — the first 
off yet another corner kick — 
running an efficient offense 
for a team primarily known as 

a defensive powerhouse.
By the 30-minute mark of 
the 90-minute game, all of the 
scoring that would happen had 
happened.
It 
wasn’t 
until 
the 
dwindling 
seconds 
of 
the 
half that Michigan regained 
momentum, 
crisply 
passing 
between 
midfielders 
and 
forwards in center of the pitch, 
but it was too late. 
At halftime, the Wolverines 
knew they had significant 
work to do with a three-goal 
deficit. 
“I told them (at halftime) I 
think we can come back and 
win 5-4 if we clean up details,” 
Klein said. “I think we were 
unfortunate to not get a goal 
in the half, but again, I thought 
we controlled a lot of play 
and really had the ball for the 
majority of the second half.”
And in the second half, 
Michigan was able to clean 
things up. The Wolverines 
made a series of defensive 
adjustments, 
such 
as 
not 

allowing the Wildcats to catch 
them in transition and not 
giving away as many corner 
opportunities—the detrimental 
flaw of the first half. 
Michigan exuded confidence 
in the final 15 minutes of the 
game after a back and forth 
start to the second half. The 
Wolverines created five or six 
viable scoring chances, but 
were unable to convert on any, 
leaving the game’s score the 
same as it was at halftime. 
Klein felt proud of her team’s 
second half appearance, noting 
that Michigan’s play didn’t 
necessarily reflect in the box 
score.
“I was proud of the team’s 
response in the second half 
to continue to fight and push, 
but we just were unfortunate,” 
Klein said. “It got close at the 
end, I told them that we needed 
to be a team that was okay 
doing some dirty work, and I 
thought we could come back 
and find a way to get a result. 
Unfortunately, we didn’t.”

‘Evil genius’ Don Brown 
aids defense in 20-17 win

It was a familiar punch 
to the jaw. Just as Notre 
Dame racked up three quick 
touchdowns in the season 
opener, 
Northwestern 
dealt the Michigan football 
team blow after blow early 
Saturday.
The Wildcats ran 17 plays 
for 145 yards on their first 
three 
drives, 
seemingly 
converting everything they 
wanted. Quarterback Clayton 
Thorson 
completed 
slant 
after 
slant, 
resembling 
a 
prized fighter meticulously 
shredding and wearing down 
his opponent. He consistently 
had 
a 
clean 
pocket 
to 
throw from — 
the Wolverines 
defensive line’s 
“twist” stunts 
weren’t getting 
home.
Michigan 
couldn’t avoid 
its 
own 
jabs, 
either. 
Its 
defense 
was 
penalized three times for 
40 yards, as yellow flags 
dismantled any resistance the 
Wolverines could muster.
Late in the first quarter, 
a 
nine-play, 
52-yard 
touchdown 
drive 
extended 
Northwestern’s lead to 17. 
It looked like a potential 
knock-out punch, especially 
with 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
sputtering.
“We 
let 
small 
missed 
assignments 
turn 
into 
a 
big gains,” said sophomore 
defensive end Kwity Paye. 
“We just had to settle down.”
“Settling down” is certainly 
not 
Don 
Brown’s 
M.O. 
The 
third-year 
defensive 
coordinator is known instead 
for 
his 
fiery 
personality, 
“solve your problems with 
aggression” 
mantra 
and 
endless 
pursuit 
of 
the 
quarterback.
But 
that’s 
exactly 
what 
Brown did for the Michigan 
defense. 
After 
the 
first 
quarter, 
the 
Wolverines 
allowed 
just 
119 
yards 
of 
total 
offense 
and 
kept 
the 
Wildcats 
from 
truly delivering 
that KO.
“He’s an evil 
genius 
of 
the 
defense,” 
said 
fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chase Winovich. 
“It’s 
more 
than 
just 
his 
coaching style, it’s his ability to 
manage relationships, which 
requires a certain level of 
genius in itself to get everyone 
on the same page.”
Naturally, aggression was 
Brown’s key to finding that 
page. Moving away from those 
twist stunts for a traditional 
pursuit, 
Michigan 
sacked 
Thorson five times in the 
second half.
“It was like, ‘Let’s put our 
best pass rushers out there 
and straight pass rush them,’ ” 

Paye said.
The problem met aggression, 
and Brown had the answer. 
Calling 
blitzes 
like 
you’d 
expect from an “evil genius,” 
Brown made Northwestern’s 
offense look lost down the 
stretch, 
its 
quarterback 
picking himself off the turf 
consistently.
Thorson couldn’t rely on 
those slants anymore, either.
As they had two weeks ago 
against SMU, safeties Josh 
Metellus and Tyree Kinnel 
struggled 
early 
on 
quick 
passing plays in man-to-man 
coverage. But Brown had his 
solution, and of course, it was 
based in physicality.
“We 
came 
in 
knowing 
that was their 
go-to 
— 
the 
short 
game,” 
said 
junior 
linebacker Josh 
Uche. 
“We 
just had to get 
better hands on 
the 
receivers 
coming off the 
line.”
And 
as 
Metellus 
and company did just that, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
was 
officially settled in. Those 
penalties, quick passes and 
points all mostly disappeared 
during the second half.
“Don 
Brown 
had 
some 
tremendous calls,” said coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “We got free 
runners to the quarterback, 
and that was big … We started 
getting our hands on some of 
those balls in the secondary 
and started applying pressure, 
and it really helped us.”
So did the play of Uche and 
Paye, which was especially 
critical 
considering 
Rashan 
Gary left injured in the third 
quarter 
— 
he 
did 
return 
eventually. 
In 
breakout 
performances, 
the 
pair 
collected 
two 
sacks 
each 
during the absence of the junior 
defense end.
True to his adjustment, it 
was Brown’s call that sealed 
Michigan’s largest come-from-
behind victory since 2011. On 
the 
game’s 
final 
play, 
Uche 
speed 
rushed 
off 
the right edge 
to 
dispatch 
Northwestern’s 
tackle 
— 
no 
twist 
stunt 
needed — and 
sack Thorson. 
“It was good 
for 
him 
to 
show himself that he could 
ball,” Paye said. “Rashan got 
injured, and he stepped up 
and made some big plays for 
us.”
Most 
importantly, 
they 
were 
the 
kind 
of 
plays 
Michigan needed with such a 
thin margin for error. With his 
team bruised and on the ropes, 
Brown helped Michigan settle 
in the only way he knows how: 
with aggression. 
“This would’ve been the 
greatest night of (their) lives,” 
Winovich said. “I think we 
spoiled that.”

Patterson shows resilience in comeback win

EVANSTON 
— 
Saturday 
wasn’t Shea Patterson’s best 
performance in a Michigan 
uniform. It’s not one that will 
litter his highlight reel or show 
off to NFL scouts. His statistics 
won’t jump off the page come 
Sunday morning.
But with 10:05 left in the 
fourth quarter, down by four 
points, Patterson took the ball 
and showed the very reason 
Michigan went and got him 
in the first place. He showed 
talent. He showed moxy. He 
showed emotion.
In the process, he went out 
and won a Big Ten football 
game on the road, roaring back 
from an early 17-0 deficit to 
beat Northwestern, 20-17.
“I saw a guy with poise, 
confidence and belief, a lot 
of faith,” said junior running 
back Karan Higdon. “When 
you work with somebody like 
that, who knows what can 
happen?”
Against Notre Dame four 
weeks 
ago, 
that 
comeback 
effort fell short, as Patterson 
fumbled on a potential game-
tying drive with 46 seconds 
left. That game crept into the 
back of Patterson’s head as he 
took the huddle, down 17-13 in 
the fourth quarter, with the 
game in his hands.
“I love when the moment’s 
big, 
even 
when 
I 
fail,” 
Patterson said. “I love that 
situation because you’ve got to 
fail to succeed.”
Patterson, who entered the 
decisive drive 12-for-21 for just 
152 yards, found Jared Wangler 
on a nine-yard checkdown in 
the flat, surveying the field 
and choosing to dump the ball 
down to his fifth-year senior 
fullback. It was Wangler’s first 
career catch.
Then, after two consecutive 
Higdon 
runs 
amounted 
to 
four 
yards, 
Patterson 
and 
the Michigan offense faced 
3rd down. He knew he was 
dropping back. Northwestern 
knew he was dropping back. 
The whole stadium knew.
Patterson 
dropped 
back 
anyway, firing a 13-yard strike 
to redshirt junior Zach Gentry 
on 
the 
sideline, 
entering 

Northwestern territory as the 
clock continued to tick.
Two plays later, he faced a 
third-and-six once again, this 
time eluding a linebacker to 
gain nine yards with his legs. 
He got off the ground and 
shimmied and signaled a first 
down with his arms.
“This is why we play the 
game, situations like this,” 
Patterson said. “It was just a 
fun feeling. Call a zone read, 
get the first down, get excited 
about the game. I love it.”
Then, the decisive play. The 
throw that will be seared into 
fans’ memories, the one that 
reminded everyone why it 
was imperative for Michigan 
to bring him in. Moments like 
this.
Patterson fired a dart to 
Gentry for 22 yards, who was 
running down the seam. It 
was the perfect location — on 
Gentry’s right shoulder. It 
had the perfect speed — just 
miliseconds before the safety 
could come over the top to 
make a play on the ball.
“They gave up a lot of stuff 
over the middle, and I think 
the adjustment in the second 
half just let your guy go make a 

play,” Patterson said. “Put it in 
the vicinity, and that’s the kind 
of guy Zach Gentry is.”
Deflect praise, as he may, 
it was an NFL throw. It was a 
winning throw.
It also brought Michigan into 
a goal-to-go situation, where, 
two plays later, Higdon walked 
in for the game-winning, five-
yard score. Patterson pumped 
his arms and sprinted back to 
the sideline.
“I like what we’re made of, 
starting with the quarterback,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. “He really stepped 
up big, took the game into his 
hands in a lot of ways there in 
the second half.”
His resilience?
“A-plus-plus,” 
Harbaugh 
added.
In the first half, Patterson 
was 
uncharacteristically 
errant 
on 
a 
few 
throws, 
lamenting 
a 
potential 
touchdown to senior Grant 
Perry in the third quarter that 
was overthrown. Throughout 
the game, he stayed positive, 
entering offense, defense and 
special teams huddles to keep 
the team morale up.
In the second half, he told 

fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich, “ ‘You take 
care of what you need to take 
care of,’ as Winovich recalled. 
“We’re going to score this 
ball, we’re going to score this 
touchdown.’ ”
And when it mattered most, 
he backed up those words.
He made every throw when 
he needed, he found first 
downs with his legs when 
the situation called for it. He 
orchestrated and executed the 
17-point comeback at the helm, 
on the road.
But there’s something with 
Patterson 
right 
now 
that 
supercedes 
his 
talent. 
An 
ambiguous “it” factor that has 
been noticeably absent in the 
quarterback room the last few 
years. 
Some 
call 
it 
leadership. 
Higdon 
opted 
for 
“belief.” 
Winovich, 
Patterson’s 
roommate, took it step further.
“I don’t know the statistics 
beside the W. I just know 
there’s something about him. 
I saw it the very first time we 
had met. He was a major factor 
in me coming back because 
there’s just an aura about him. 
… He’s a football player.
