to reinstate the
MichiganPromise Scholarship-a
popular, merit-based program cut
from the state budgeton Oct. 30.
Their efforts advocating for an
already-killed state program have
a renewed sense of vigor of late,
brought on by Michigan Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm's recent push to re-
heat the debate over funding the
scholarship.
Both students and University
administrators have a stake in
bringing the scholarship back.
Without it, students stand to lose
tuition funding that they and their
families were counting on. For the
University, which has pledged to
fill the tuition void for students
with demonstrated financial need,
the program's elimination carries
a hefty price tag - one sure to fur-
ther complicate an already delicate
budget picture for the next fiscal
year.

About two dozenUniversity stu-

chair of MSA's Committee on
External Relations.
"We've been able to come to a
mutually beneficial position where
clearly the University and the stu-

of bringing the Promise Scholar-

System crashed
last semester after
course evaluations
0 went paperless
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
Ldst winter term, the night
before the end of classes was may-
hem for students in the Fishbowl,

Undergraduate Library and other
computing sites across campus.
After administrators went
paperless with course evaluations,
and made them only accessible on
CTools, the website crashed and
students couldn't access their lec-
ture slides and notes on CTools to
study for finals.
But this semester, officials say
students can rest easy.
Yesterday, in an interview with
the Daily, University officials out-
lined their plan for ensuring that

CTools doesn't crash during finals
time. They cited updates to soft-
ware and alarger server as improve-
ments that will allow students to fill
out course evaluations on CTools
without overloading the site.
John Williams, executive direc-
tor of Digital Media Commons,
said that the issues that occurred
between April 18-22 this year were
not caused because something in
the system "broke," but, rather,
because the core services that
CTools has provided over the last

three years had expanded dramati-
cally.
He addedthe biggest factor inthe
crash were very quick, high-volume
spikes in the website's usage, that
occurred in a matter of seconds.
"We didn't anticipate these very
short, very high spikes in load
because the system is being used in
ways that we've never seen before,"
Williams said.

analysis" began immediately after

CLASSROOM CLICKERS
'U'mulls Qwizdom alternatives

Students, faculty say
clicker isn't meeting
classroom needs
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Soon it may be time to power off
the Qwizdom clicker system for
good and make way for new tech-
nology.
Instructional Support Services
and the LSA Student Government
have been researching replacement

options for the student response
remotes used in lectures at the Uni-
versity, most of which are for sci-
ence and engineering courses.
The reasoning behind these
changes comes from multiple prob-
lems ISS has encountered with the
Qwizdom system, which has been
in place for about three or four
years.
These problems include multiple
technical bugs within the system, a
lack of reliability in storing grades
and Qwizdom's incompatibility
with Apple computers and Win-
dows Vista.

The set-up of the system also
does not allow professors to navi-
gate away from the Qwizdom
slides.
"It kind of discourages profes-
sors from using YouTube, or using
video clips or audio clips," said
Laura Hlebasko, vice chair of the
LSA Student Government's Advi-
sory Committee to ISS.
Student feedback from online
evaluations was also taken into
account with the selections, which
prompted ISS to look into systems

How Ann Arbor bucked the expected trend

While relatively unas-
suming today, Fourth
Street in Ann Arbor had
a bit of a reputation in the
early 1970s as a "sex com-
plex," with several stores
selling pornographic mate-
rials to students and area
residents.
But on June 21, 1973, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled
in Miller v. California that
obscenity was not protect-
ed by the First Amendment.
The expected result was
a subsequent crackdown
in the porn industry and
a drop in business for Ann
Arbor's stores.
However, Dwight Wil-
liams, owner of Adult News
- one of the stores located
on Fourth Street - said ina
Sept. 6, 1973 article in The

Michigan Daily that the
ruling had quite the oppo-
site effect.
Despite the court rul-
ing, Williams told the Daily
at the time that he did not
see the need to remove or
censor any items from his
shelves. In fact, he antici-
pated an increase in sales if
he did.
"People dig what they
can get," Williams said. "It
was getting too open here -
like in Sweden. Everything
was being exposed."
In his store, paperback
novels with colored covers
bearing titles like "Deep
Mouth" and "Born to Stud"
lined the shelves. Films,
sex tabloids and magazines
were also featured among
the products sold.

At the time, Williams
told the Daily that his work
wasn't as exciting as some
may imagine.
"When you're staring at
this stuff every day, sex just
isn't that important any-
more," Williams said. "You
find there are more impor-
tant things in life."
Williams said at the time
that he found interacting
with his customers to be the
most rewarding aspect of
his job. Students composed
30 percent of Hs business,
and couples also frequented
the store on weekends.
Across the street from
his shop was Figure Model-
ing Agency, and right next
door was Adult Books and
Peep Shows - infamous for
its free half-hour massages

that. came with every pur-
chased sex movie of a cer-
tain value.
According to the Daily
article, none of these stores
appeared to be affected at
all by the Supreme Court
ruling, and local officials
interviewed at the time
didn't seem concerned with
the state of business.
Washtenaw County
Prosecutor William Del-
hey said at the time that he
didn't "think the decision
will have any bearing on
things here."
Additionally, while inthe
Adult News store one Ann
Arbor policeman said, "If
people wantto see this kind
of stuff, they have a perfect
right to, it's fine with me."

LANSING, Mich.
Michigan Senate
OKs changes to
state's school law
Michigan's efforts to win more
federal cash for schools could result
in changes that would cause some
angst beyond education circles.
Among them is a proposal that
would eliminate the requirement
that Michigan schools wait to start
classes until after Labor Day. It's
one of several changes proposed
in legislation that supporters say
would give Michigan a shot at
winning up to $400 million in the
Obama administration's Race to the
Top competition.
A state law passed in 2005
requires public schools to start
classes after Labor Day so families
could extend summer vacations
and tourism-related businesses
could have teen workers available
into early September. It was a pro-
vision sought mainly by Michigan
tourism interests, along with the
agriculture industry.
Some lawmakers say eliminating
that requirement may improve the
state's chances of securing more
federal cash for schools.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Granholm seeks
legal action
against Asian carp
Gov. Jennifer Granholm wants
Michigan's attorney general to take
legal action to prevent Asian carp
from invading the Great Lakes.
Granholm and Lt. Gov. John
Cherry sent Attorney General Mike
Cox a letter Wednesday urging him
to "pursue every legal tool" avail-
able.
They say among possible actions
are closing the Chicago Sanitary
and Ship Canal, part of a waterway
linking Lake Michigan with the
Mississippi River.
A Granholm spokeswoman
says Michigan could file lawsuits
against the state of Illinois and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It
also could try to prevent Southern
fish farms that use Asian carp from
importing more of them.
Five environmental groups also
have sent Cox a letter with similar
requests.
Cox's office had no immediate
comment.

Vallejo's mayor is under fire

Dozens of protesters waved rain-
bow flags and held signs demand-
ing separation of church and state

Davis' resignation.
Davis told The New York Times
last month that gays are "commit-

The New York Times also

the teaching evaluations had to be
shut down. In addition to software
improvements, Information Tech-
nology Services has made system
performance more efficient and
included a contingency plan for the
2009 teaching evaluations period.
"There are some minor features
that have been questioned, primar-
ily by students, that produce a lot
of load that we could temporarily
suspend without a loss of function-
ality," Williams said.
These features include services
like "users present" - the list on
the left-hand side of a page that
shows who is on the same page -
and e-mail digest, an option that
displays a list of e-mails one has
received through CTools.
In order to check the CTools
system, Williams discussed an
important analysis called "load
testing" which allows those who
run CTools to simulate different
loads on the system. But, despite
the use of that testing last year,
Williams said the system still
crashed in April because students
were using CTools in these new,
different ways.
one of those new ways was the
online course evaluations - a sys-
tem that allows students to give
feedback to their professors and
graduate student instructors via
an online medium rather than the
pencil and paper version.
Jim Kulik, director and research
scientist of the Office of Evalua-
tions and Examinations, said that
there are as many as 8,000-9,000
classes available for online evalua-
tion during the end of the term as
opposed to approximately 1,500

of places," not just along the pain
pathway or in the nervous system.
The presence of opiate receptors
in other areas of the body is one
reason opiate-based treatment of
pain results in side effects that
limit the dosages clinicians can
use, he said.
Fink added that the gene ther-
apy approach his laboratory is
developing may offer a more effec-
tive alternative pain treatment,
avoidingtheside effects associated
with opiate treatments. Since HSV
naturally possesses the capac-
ity and mechanisms necessary for
transmitting genetic information
to targeted cell types, Fink said
that the virus is a well-suited vec-
tor for the study.
The Department of Veterans
Affairs awarded a $1.8 million
grant early last month to fund the

given at midterm time.
At this point, Kulik said he feels
positive about the influx of stu-
dents tryingto complete their eval-
uations. After making it through
both the summer term and this
fall's midterm season without inci-
dent, he said he feels more confi-
dent about the process.
"What was unique to the winter
situation was a problem developed
that the only real alternative was
to shut down the whole service so
that all the other services CTools
provided would be there for stu-
dents," he said.
This semester, to avoid a situ-
ation like last spring, teaching
evaluations will be offered over a
longer period of time - from Dec.
4-15 - to cut down on the load and
to give students more opportunity
to complete the evaluations.
Kulik also discussed an initiative
to increase communication with
students, including e-mail updates
and reminders to complete evalua-
tions as well as CTools reminders
and posters across campus.
"We've tried a number of new
things and communication activi-
ties that have increased rather than
diminished (communication),"
Kulik said. "We're hoping that stu-
dents will be aware that the evalu-
ations are here and the importance
that teachers put on getting good
feedback from students."
Alan Levy, communications spe-
cialist fdr ITS, said that the most
valuable method ofcommunication
about evaluations is via professors
and GSIs in their classrooms.
"There is both some research
and anecdotal evidence that the
single greatest factor that predicts
students completing evaluations
is instructor encouragement,"
Levy said.
HSV research.
Fink said pharmaceutical com-
panies and start-up firms - not
grants - are usually the sources of
funding for such undertakings. He
said the new grant will fund the
production of a human-grade her-
pes simplex vector, which is.essen-
tial for testing the gene-transfer
pain therapy in clinical trials
involving human patients.
"The start-ups are ideally suited
for novel work but have limited
resources, while the pharmaceuti-
cal companies are typically more
risk-averse," Fink said.
But in the currguhentslnomic
environment,hesaid,pharmaceuti-
-cal corporations havebecome even
more cautious about funding inno-
vative research. In light of the hes
itation frompharmaceuticals,FPink
said, grants specifically intended
to fund translational research to
produce certified human-grade
vectors are critical to advancing
new medical research.

Gov. Paterson
disappointed by
vote shortfall
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New
York lawmakers rejected a bill
Wednesday that would have made
their state the sixth to allow gay
marriage, stunning advocates
who weathered a similar decision
by Maine voters just last month.
The New York measure need-
ed 32 votes to pass and failed by
a wider-than-expected margin,
falling eight votes short ina 24-38
decision by the state Senate. The
Assembly had earlier approved
the bilt, and Gov. David Paterson,
perhaps the bill's strongest advo-
cate, had pledged to sign it.
After the vote, Paterson called
Wednesday one of his saddest
days in 20 years of public service
and he criticized senators who
he said support gay marriage but
"didn't have the intestinal forti-
tude to vote for it.

Legislature's first openly gay
member, expressed anger and dis-
appointment. "I wasn't expecting
betrayal," he said.
During debate, Sen. Ruben
Diaz, a conservative minister
from the Bronx, led the mostly
Republican opposition.
"If you put this issue before
the voters, the voters will reject
it," Diaz said. "Let the people
decide."
But Sen. Eric Adams, D-Brook-
lyn, challenged lawmakers to set
aside their religious beliefs and
vote for the bill. He asked them to
rememberthat once even slavery
was legal.
"When I walk through these
doors, my Bible stays out," Adams
said.
"That's the wrong statement,"
Diaz countered later. "You should
carry your Bible all the time."

Missing the election
Students should care enough to vote in MSA elections
his year, students returning to campus after Thanksgiv-
ing break might have been surprised to discover that the
Michigan Student Assembly was holding its fall election -
if they noticed at all, that is. According to the Daily, only 3,565 out
of 39,671 students voted. That's a shame, because after a semester of
contentious MSA issues that affect the lives of students, the cam-
pus population should have felt compelled to vote. Responsibility is
twofold - MSA must do more to remind students of the election
and encourage participation, and students must demonstrate to the
University administration that they care about the way this campus
is governed by holding the assembly accountable in elections.

What American people did not bargain for
was another four years for one of the key
architects of the Bush economy."

confirmation hearing for his second term, as reported yesterday by CNN.

Chill out on global warming

The MSA Compiled Code sets timetables
for the elections, which are held each fall
and each winter semester. Due to a con-
flict between these timetables and MSA's
delayed selection of an election director,
the assembly was forced to push back the
election to the day after Thanksgiving
break. in addition, MSA was unable to get
a link to the online voting site placed on
the desktops of all campus computers as
it had planned. The result was an election
that garnered roughly 9 percent student
turnout - a slight drop from last fall's 9.6
percent - despite an expectation of higher
turnout from MSA leadership.
The day after Thanksgiving break was
certainly a less-than-ideal time to hold the
election, resulting in decreased last-min-
ute campaigning on the Diag that typically
serves to remind students to vote. Though
it's true that MSA was in a bind over when
to hold the election, the assembly should
make sure this doesn't happen again in
the future by picking an election director
earlier, if necessary. And the fact that the
voting links on campus computers never
materialized doesn't exactly speak well for
voteroutreach efforts, either.
That said, students shouldn't be waiting
for flashing neon lights that give them step-
by-step instructions on how and when to
vote. Students should feel a responsibility
to express their opinions of MSA's actions
and whether or not they approve of its
members and leadership. MSA can hardly
be expected to listen to students' needs or
fight for students' interests when it is only

accountable to 9 percent of campus. And
MSA will be more empowered to stand up
to the administration if they have student
votes to back them up.
After all, this semester was an impor-
tant one for the assembly, which dealt with
several issues directly relevant to students.
The revelation that for years MSA has been
appointing students to the Department of
Public Safety Oversight Committee rather
than holding campus-wide elections as
required by state law is something students
should be speaking up about. This commit-
tee is intended to be students' strongest
check on the University police system, and
its mismanagement over the last decade
should be getting students' attention. And
the fact that the University administration
looked the other way with regard to this
committee only strengthens the need for
students to vote.
That's not to say that students only have
reasons to be upset with members of the
assembly. Their support of state Sen. Liz
Brater's (D-Ann Arbor) Good Samaritan
bill - which would protect students from
getting minors in possession in instances
where they need to call for help on behalf
of friends who were drinking - was instru-
mental in assuring the bill's passage.
The point is that good or bad, MSA is
making decisions that effect students and
ones should care about. But the assem-
bly won't have a reason for its decision to
reflect campus's sentiments until students
vote in MSA elections in considerably larg-
er numbers.

ust before the onset of a win-
ter that some forecasters pre-
dict will be one of the coldest
in decades, a new
scandal is rocking
the global climate
change debate.
Last month, an
unidentified com-
puter hacker broke
into a server con-
taining private
emails from the
Climate. Research CHRIS
Unit at Britain's KOSLOWSKI
University of East
Anglia. The con- _
tent of the emails,
many skeptics of climate change
claim, is a smoking gun, proving the
existence of a conspiracy by lead-
ing British and American climate
researchers. Certain emails seem to
point to the researchers' deliberate
misrepresentation of climate data and
desire to suppress conflicting opin-
ions. The scandal is fueling the fire for
those who argue that climate change'
caused by humans is at best, shoddy
science and at worst, a giant hoax.
The University of East Anglia has
launched an investigation into the
matter. Phil Jones, director of the Cli-
mate Research Unit there and author
of several of the leaked e-mails,
announced Tuesday his intention to
voluntarily step down from his posi-
tion during the inquiry.
In a time when human-initiated
global warming is supposedly Gospel
truth and passing legislation meant
to battle climate change is one of the
primary concerns for governments
around the world, this scandal adds a
touch of doubt to the issue's purport-
edly airtight science. Governments
and organizations, including the Uni-
versity of Michigan, should use this
doubt as an opportunity to ensure
that fear is not the motivation behind

their environmental programs.
I've been a man-made global
warming skeptic for years. I could
go on and on about how warming
isn't necessarily a bad thing, and how
sunspots - dark spots on the surface
of the sun - probably impact our cli-
mate more than humanity's green-
house gas emissions. But before you
boo me for ignoring "science," killing
polar bears and dooming my progeny
to some apocalyptic future, I want to
concentrate on a factor which all too
often motivates the fight against cli-
mate change. That, of course, is fear.
Every year, Al Gore, Ted Danson
or some other politician or celebrity
warns us that we only have 10 years
left to save the world from environ-
mental destruction. We're fed images
of glaciers melting and animals suf-
fering. We're told to drive hybrid cars
and use compact fluorescent light
bulbs or else rising temperatures will
raise sea levels and cause widespread
famine. We're made to fear this loom-
ing climate crisis, and that fear is
supposed to motivate us to conserve,
buy and vote in accordance with what
the so-called experts tell us.
I'm completely in support of
reducing pollution, conserving our
resources and protecting Earth's
creatures. It's our moral responsi-
bility, it makes economic sense, and
it's just nice to live in a clean place.
But using fear to push this agenda is
wrong. Fear causes us to make hasty,
expensive decisions, to make sacri-
fices we don't need to make, to ignore
legitimate counterarguments and
concerns and to rely on government
to placate our worries.
If you believe that we only have 10
years until the Earth fries, you should
be afraid. But if you're like me and
believe that gradual, continual mod-
ernization ofoutdated forms of trans-
portation and energy creation will
ensure a lasting harmony between

people and our environment, you
should allow this latest climate scan-
dal to remind you howsome are using
fear to push action.
organizations like the Univer-
sity have spent millions of dollars
on "green" projects. Administrators
believe the impact and the example
set by these initiatives are worth the
investment. I may not agree that the
results of these projects justify the
expenses, but I can respect the Uni-
versity as long as it makes educated
environmental policy decisions. If
fear of a climate crisis is the motiva-
tion behind the University's actions,
however, I cannot maintain that
respect.
Climate changetc
hysteria WOn't do
us any good.
Some might say it's best to havesa
healthy dose of fear in order to avoid a
scenario in which the climate drasti-
callychanges and it's too late forus to
make a difference. Even if such a dev-
astating change is bound to happen,
I have yet to encounter any evidence
that we could do something to stop it.
Others might argue the East Anglia
climate scandal is just a big misinter-
pretation. Still, we should realize just
how much passion, terror and rage
the climate change issue inspires. In
order to appropriately address our
environmental concerns, we need to
detach from our fear of destruction
and take a long, smart look at the big
picture. On climate change, we need
to chill.

Those of you who risked your safety and sanity at shop-
ping malls in the early morning hours of Black Friday
may have missed the most significant news story of last
weekend. No, I'm not talking about nuclear weapons in
Iran or the effect of holiday travel on the environment. I
am talking about Tiger Woods's mysterious car accident.
Talk about a hard-hitting news story.
With all of the media coverage of the incident, he must
have been seriously injured, right? No, not really. He hurt
someone else, then? No, he just hit a fire hydrant and a
tree. Are the rumors that his wife found out he was having
an affair and attacked him with a golf club true? Though
anything is possible, these have yet to be confirmed.
So, why should anyone care about this? They shouldn't.
Woods's so-called "indiscretions" are irrelevant. The
media onslaught that came in the wake of this event
forced me to question society's priorities. The sad truth is
that Woods is not the first professional athlete to be cor-
rupted by an affair z- rumored or factual - and he cer-
tainly will not be the last. Though intriguing, the sexual
escapades of a professional golfer really aren't the public's
concern.
But when the American media gets their hands on
something this juicy, they just can't help themselves.
The societal obsession with celebrities seems to be in
overdrive lately. There is no such thing as a low profile. If
you are even remotely famous and you dare to sneeze in
public, someone is going to talk about it. I get the feeling
thatthe producers ofmorningtalkshowswakeupeveryday
praying that Octo-Mom is pregnant, that Balloon Boy actu-
ally flies away in a balloon and that Adam Lambert humps
another man's face in public. I'm pretty confident that Matt
Lauer would sacrifice his first-born child to go through the
spectacle of Michael Jackson's death all over again.
America loves a scandal, and Woods's situation is the
best kind: The fall from grace. What is interesting about

an attractive, young, wealthy, champion athlete, philan-
thropist and low-key guy? Nothing. But toss a banged-up
Escalade, an alleged affair with a stripper and an alleged-
ly angry wife into the mix, and now we have a story. There
is no reputation too clean to tarnish. With hard work and
perseverance anyone can be made to look like a total jerk.
By looking at the incident from this perspective, it's
absurd. But America still tunes in. Public attention has
been focused on Woods even more intently than when
he's playing golf. Woods released a statement apologizing,
taking responsibility and asking for privacy, but of course
the prying still hasn't stopped. Everyone wants to know
more and they need to know now. And the media is aware
that whoever reports this information first, wins.
But with all the craziness going on in the world, the
preoccupation with Woods is a shame. There are many
important and significant things happening on the planet
right now. Conflict in the Middle East, the global econo-
my and the environment - these things are relevant and
require our attention. Time magazine, in its November
issue, termed the past 10 years the "Decade from Hell."
It's true that life in America hasn't been fun lately. But
buying into the media-induced distractions of celebrity
gossip won't make life better. We need to focus on the
realities that affect our day-to-day lives if we are ever
going to fix them, no matter how unpleasant they may
be. Incidents like Woods's might provide us with distrac-
tions, but they are distractions we can't afford right now.
Students, especially, need to be wary of falling into
the bottomless pit that is the celebrity obsession culture.
Much of the task of making the world suck less will very
soon fall to us, and knowing how many seasons of VHl's
Tool Academy that Jamiee Grubbs - Woods's alleged
mistress - appeared in probably won't be relevant.
Michelle DeWitt is an LSA sophomore.

Blue shooting
woes continue

'M' could send two to World Juniors

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Writer
Coming into the season, Michi-
gan coach John Beilein knew that
just like last year, the Wolverines
had to be the hunters instead of the
hunted - they needed to focus on
their opponents and not on their
ranking.
But for the third straight game,
the Michigan basketball team
looked like roadkill throughout
much
of yes- BOSTON COLLEGE 62
terday's MICHIGAN 58
62-58 loss
to Boston College at Crisler Arena.
"We have our goals," sophomore
guard Stu Douglass said. "But we
just didn't focus on playing and
hunting like Coach talked about
in the preseason and we just got to
get back to what we know we can
do."
Even though the Wolverines
(3-3) lost by just four points, the
score was deceptive. The Eagles
dominated in both scoring and
rebounding, nailing 47 percent
of their shots and outrebounding
Michigan 43-32.
While M ichigan couldn't help
its conference in the Big Ten/ACC
Challenge, the Big Ten still pulled
off its first victory in its 11year his-
tory, winning six games to five.
Michigan's problems last night
were similar to those during last
weekend's Old Spice Classic. The
Wolverines got off to a slow start,
struggled to shoot 3-pointers
and couldn't make key defensive
stops.
By the halfway point of the first
half, Boston College (5-2) had built
a 23-12 lead, setting Michigan
behind the eight-ball for the entire
game.
In fact, the Wolverines were
lucky to get out of the period down
10 after the Eagles shot 54 percent
from the court, led by forward
Corey Raji. He sliced through
a brittle Wolverine defense all
night, finishing with 24 points. He
was one rebound short of a double-
double,, , '.t
"(Raji) didn't have too many
people guarding him today, he's

ously, they're a pretty good team
or we're a pretty bad team. I know
the score came close at the end, but
there was no doubt who the better
team was out there today."
Down 57-40 with five minutes
to play, senior forward Zack Gib-
son made two quick 3-pointers off
of screens to bring the Wolverines
within 11. While Michigan made it
appear as if the game was close, it
was simply a mirage as the Eagles
ran out the clock in the final min-
utes.
"We missed some opportuni-
ties," Beilein said. "DeShawn obvi-
ously got in foul trouble, but Zack
gave us a good lift, too. We're just
not a well-functioning as a unit
rightnow, and that's what I'm sup-
posed to do, figure that out."
Like in its other losses, Michi-
gan didn't have enough contribu-
tors. While junior Manny Harris
led the team with 19 points, he was
dormant throughout much of the
game, scoring just six points in the
first half and missing key layups
down the stretch.
After the game, Harris blamed
the loss on himself, even though
the finger could be pointed in a
multitude of directions.
"There are things out there, if
it's either leadership or talking
more or my defensive habits," Har-
ris said. "Just a lot of areas where I
think I could make our team bet-
ter, and I'm not doing it. They kind
of feed off what I do, and I don't
think I'm doing something right.
There's no way we should lose
three straight games."
The loss is a considerable shock
after the Wolverines were ranked
15th in the nation in the AP pre-
season poll. Michigan nowhas to
pull itself together before the holi-
day break if it wants to salvage the
first part of the season.
That won't be easy. The Wolver-
ines head to Utah and No. 1Kansas
in the coming weeks.
tf"It would have been hard for me
to say,'listen we're there,'" Beilein
said of his team's preseason No. 15
ranking. "At the same time, there is
a concern - w6 need to win games
against good teams...And collec-
tively, we'll band together and find
a way to do it."

to see them go, it's an opportunity
for them to represent their coun-
try in a great tournament. They
only get one or two opportunities
like this, and I think that's a pret-
ty special thing."
But two trends could possibly
be detrimental for Michigan next
month. Players in the past have
returned from the championships
either fatigued from the constant
hockey or with a changed style
of play after they compete with a
completely different set of talent.
But Rust doesn't agree.
After scoring just two goals
before the World Juniors Cham-
pionships last year, Rust broke out
of his slump in a big way after the

international event, scoring nine
goals in 21 games.
"You're playing against the best
kids in the world," Rust said. "The
speed of play is faster, guys are
stronger, the puck moves quicker,
so you learn to up your ante for
your play and that helps in the sec-
ond half of the season here."
And Brown assures that if he
and Wohlberg make the final U.S.
roster, neither will slump, since
U.S. coach Dean Blais knows what
both bring to the table.
"We really don't change styles,"
Brown said. "Every coach knows
I'm going to play physical and be a
power forward, and I think that's
why U.S.A. Hockey invited me.
It's the same type of thing that I
do here.
"It won't be a hard transition

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

ZELL
From Page 1A
Tribune Company when he led
a movement to take the compa-
ny private in a deal worth $8.2
billion.
The deal to make the compa-
ny private left the Tribune with
more than $13 million worth of
debt on its books, according to
Reuters. That debt, paired with
an industry-wide decline in
advertising revenue, drove the
company into Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy, which it has been in for
about a year, according to the
Tribune.
The change in leadership
came just one day after the
company's exclusive right to
file a reorganization plan in its
Chapter 11 case was extended
by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court
judge in Delaware until Feb.
28.
Zell and his late business
partner Robert Lurie began
their real estate investment
careers and partnership during
their time at the University.
"They began buying in apart-
ment buildings and they start-
ed it and they became student
landlords," said Jerry May, the
University's vice president for
development.
Zell and Lurie continued to
invest in properties across the
Midwest, eventually moving to
Chicago where they founded
Equity Group Investments.
May said Zell - a graduate
of the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, the Law
School and the Business School
- has continued to maintain
close ties to the University
throughout his rise on the cor-
porate ladder.
Zell founded, through a $10

million gift, the Samuel Zell
and Robert H. Lurie Institute
for Entrepreneurial Studies
at the University's business
school. He also established the
Sam Zell Dean's Tactical Fund
at the Law School.
May said Zell has been more
actively involved with the Uni-
versity than the typical donor,
serving on the president's advi-
sory board and coming back to
the University to speak to stu-
dents year after year.
In addition, Zell and his wife
Helen were honorary co-chairs
of the Michigan Difference
Campaign, which raised $3.2
billion for the University - the
most of any campaign by a pub-
lic university to date.
"For some organizations
(being an honorary co-chair)
can be kind of a passive role,
if anything (the Zells) are not
passive - they are great sup-
porters and leaders at the Uni-
versity," May said. "It's a really
deep commitment that they
have to the University."
May, who described Zell as
"a really cool guy," said he isn't
shy about offering advice to
University administrators.
"Anybody that's interacted
with Sam knows that Sam is
one of the most straightforward
leaders that you will ever find,"
May said. "He's a very exciting
executive to watch."
May said he couldn't com-
ment on how Zell's decision to
step down as CEO of the Tri-
bune Company will affect his
relationship with the Univer-
sity.
"I don't deal with Sam in that
particular realm," he said. "He
and Helen have been among
the most tremendous leaders at
Michigan and I know that will
continue."

PROMISE
Fror Page 1A
said Raymond, who also sits on the
Division of Student Affairs Advisory
Board.
According to E. Royster Harper,
vice president for Student Affairs, her
office was willing to pay for the bus so
that students could voice their con-
cerns about the state's cuts to higher
education and financial aid - specifi-
cally the Promise Scholarship.
"We often help students as they
work to have their voices heard in
critical debates that affect them
directly, including the current dis-
cussion about the Michigan Promise
Scholarship program," Harper wrote
in an e-mail to The Michigan Daily.
The University and student groups
also worked together in producing
videos to be sent to state legislators,
in which about 35 students who were
eligible for the Promise Scholarship
told their stories of how the elimina-
tion of the scholarship affects them
and their families.
The Office of the Vice President
for Communications offered to pay
for the videographer and to edit and
"professionalize" the videos to be
sent to legislators, while MSA and
LSA Student Government organized
and facilitated the actual production
of the videos, accordingto Raymond.
"We decided this video would be
a great way of combining University
and student resources to really have
an effective way of lobbying legisla-
tors," Raymond said.
UNIVERSITYINTERESTS
University administrators also
have a vested interest in having the
Promise Scholarship reinstated, as
the University has vowed to fill the
tuition gap left by the program's elim-
ination for students with demonstrat-
ed financial need, Raymond said.

"It's essentially going to cost the
University money if it doesn't come
back," he said.
The University has said that this
year,it willprovide extrafinancial aid
to 1,984 students - those for whom
the scholarship would have gone
toward demonstrated financial need
- out of thetotal 6,172 University stu-
dents eligible for the grants.
This amount totals to $2.3 million,
and is being paid by federal stimulus
money allocated to the University for
this academic year, according to Cyn-
thia Wilbanks, vice president for Gov-
ernment Relations forthe University.
"For those students who did have
the Promise, who are notgoingto get
it this year, their need remains; so
we made the commitment and we're
keeping the commitment to those
students," Wilbanks said.
While stimulus funds can serve as
a Band-Aid this year, the elimination
of the Promise Scholarship and other
financial aid and scholarships from
the state like the Michigan Competi-
tive Scholarship could make creating
the budget for the 2011 fiscal year
more of a struggle for the University,
Wilbanks said.
"It may create a challenge because
it's funding that, right now, we have
to identify in the budget process,"
Wilbanks said.
But the University cannot predict
what the legislature will do for the
state's 2011 fiscal year budget Wil-
banks said, and as such, does not
know the exact implications the elim-
ination of the Promise Scholarship
will have on next year's expenditures
for the University.
In addition to the University's
efforts in facilitating students' com-
municationwithMichiganlegislators,
the Office for Government Relations
has been corresponding with mem-
bers of the legislature, in collabora-
tion with other colleges in the state,
to stress the importance of the Prom-
ise Scholarship for students.

However, their efforts have not yet
been successful in convincing legisla-
tors to restore the scholarship, Wil-
banks said.
While the University clearly has
some interests on the line, Wil-
banks said the issue is ultimately one
between the students and the state
government, which is why the Univer-
sity has been aiding students in getting
their message across tolegislators.
"What we did was to help to facili-
tate students who own this issue,"
Wilbanks said.
OTHER SCHOOLS' EFFORTS
The University stands in the mid-
dle of the spectrum in terms of what
other state universities are doing to
make up those missing funds for stu-
dents.
Michigan State University is cov-
ering the funds for all 8,200 students
who were eligible for the scholarship
for the fall semester - not just those
with demonstrated need as the Uni-
versity did, according to Val Meyers,
associate financial aid director at
MSU. However, MSU is only covering
the scholarship amount for those stu-
dents who demonstrate need for the
spring semester, Meyers said.
"Michigan State has replaced the
scholarship awards for many of our
students," Meyers said. "So that was
our focus rather than concentrating
solely on our legislature."
This replacement of the scholar-
ship money will cost MSU $8 million
this year, which the school is also
funding through the federal stimulus
money, according to Meyers.
EasternMichiganUniversityisonly
providing those funds for just over
300 students who "demonstrate the
highest need," said Bernise Linbke,
vice president of Student Affairs and
Enrollment Management at EMU.
Additional funds may be allocated
to students on a case-by-case basis,
and may come in the form of addi-

Thursday, December 3, 2009 - 7A
tional work-study opportunities or
loans, Linbke said.
Wayne State University has been
working with administrations at other
universities to communicate with
legislators, specifically members of
the Higher Education Appropriations
Committees in each chamber, to con-
vince them of how essential the schol-
arship is for its 3,000 students who are
eligible for the scholarship this year,
Greg Bird, director of State Relations
for Wayne State University, said.
"Many in the legislature talk about
the importance of education, but
we've seen over the past few years
their words notmatch up; their action
not match up with that rhetoric," Bird
said. "So it's important to let them
know that this scholarship and any
financial aid programming they've
been cutting is very important."
Wayne State is covering the funds
for all of its students who are eligi-
ble for the Promise Scholarship for
this year, which totals $1.4 million,
according to Bird.
But Bird said if the Promise Schol-
arship is not restored next year, stu-
dents will no longer receive that
credit in funds from the university.
"Unfortunately, universities, just
like families across the state, have
come across difficult economic times
and the legislature has not only cut
funding for scholarships like the
Promise, but they've cut funding for
universities," he said.
Wilbanks said that while the vari-
ous university officials and students
are trying to galvanize support forthe
program, history is notonctheir side.
"We certainly did our work in talk-
ing with legislators about the impor-
tance of the grants, but at the end of the
daythevotespassed inboththe House
andSenateinthehigher educationbud-
get that did not include the funds," she
said. "And there's some days the efforts
of 15 universities can work miracles;
this year, the decisions were made to go
in a differentdirection."

What are your five favorite records to
scratch on the turntables?
5. AC/DC - "Back in Black": I like to sound like Rick Rubin on a 1986 Beastie
Boys record. Full of guitars.
4. Run DMC - "Here We Go (Live At The Funhouse)": This is a live perfor-
mance by Run DMC - there are a bunch of different parts to scratch on it.
3. Run DMC - "Peter Piper": Jam-Master Jay made this song by DJing. Now
DJs like to scratch it.
2. Jive Rhythm Trax - "122 BPM": Not really a record I scratch, it's a record to
scratch to. DJ Jazzy Jeff uses it on He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper.
1. Fab 5 Freddy - "Change The Beat": Almost every DJ knows the sounds on
this record but no one knows they came from this record. It's the famous "Ahh
fresh." You can hear it scratched on Herbie Hancock's "Rockit."

ONLINE GAMES OF THE WEEK

MEMORY MATRIX
"Memory Matrix" will test both your abilities of spatial
recall and your abilities to waste time. You're shown a pattern
of red squares on a grid for only a few seconds, then asked to
recreate it yourself. As you progress, both the grid size and the
number of red squares increase. But for a game that merely
asks you to remember something, "Matrix" is surprisingly
addictive.

The Fellowship of the 'U'alum's script

Angus Fletcher awarded
$30,000 grant for his
screenplay 'Sand Dogs'
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Michigan alumnus Angus Fletcher
(class of '98) has just become the envy of
screenwriters everywhere, nabbing him-
self, along with writing partner Vineet
Dewan, an esteemed Nicholl Fellowship
for his screenplay "Sand Dogs." Out of
a record 6,380 scripts submitted to the
fellowship, five were selected this year
by volunteer Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences members to receive a
$30,000 grant.
In celebration, Fletcher spent seven
days rubbing shoulders with Hollywood
elite during the week of the offical awards
ceremony.
"It's basically a whole week of you being
celebrated," Fletcher said. "You spend a

couple days surrounded by people respon-
sible for the greatest movies ever made in
the past 40, 50 years. At dinner we were
sitting next to the guy who made 'Beverly
Hills Cop,' which blew my mind when I
was a child."
"Everyone you look at is sort of a hero,"
he added. "All these people say very nice
things about you and your head gets real
large."
Awarded to new writers who haven't
sold a screenplay for more than $5,000,
the Nicholl Fellowship operates under the
Academy of the Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, otherwise known as the Acade-
my. The Fellowship is known for being the
most prestigious screenwriting competi-
tion in the nation. Notable Nicholl fellows
from the past are now heavyweights in
the industry. The group including Susan-
nah Grant ("Erin Brockovich"), Mike Rich
("Finding Forrester") and Andrew Mar-
lowe ("Air Force One").
"The Nicholl Fellowship started when
a woman named Gee Nicholl - the widow
of Don Nicholl. a TV writer best known

for 'The Jeffersons' and 'Three's Com-
pany' - brought the idea of helping new
writers to the Academy in 1985," Greg
Beal, director of the Nicholl Fellowship,
said. "There have now been 113 writers
who have won the award. This is the 24th
year of the Fellowship."
Fletcher's own initiation into the film
industry started a little more humbly.
"A couple years ago, Vineet won a lot of
awards for a very good short film called
'Clear Cut, Simple,' " Fletcher said. "I saw
the movie and I was very impressed with
his work, and we talked for a little bit and
we made a connection."
For the next year, Fletcher and Dewan
would work together on the script now
known as "Sand Dogs."
"I would write a draft and Vineet would
take the draft and make changes ... Each
of us would add different things. I'm more
interested in plot and he's more interested
in design and detail," Fletcher said. "We
kind of kicked it back and forth like a ping
pong ball."
Fletcher and Dewan originally intend-

ed to submit "Sand Dogs" to the Sundance
Screenwriting Contest, but missed the
deadline for this year.
"We thought, 'The Nicholl is such a
big fellowship we probably don't have a
chance of winning, but we should give it a
shot,'" Fletcher said.
A few months ago, Fletcher and Dewan
were notified by Beal of their finalist
standing. Since then, it's all been a dream.
They've been bombarded by e-mails from
production companies that want to sign
them and phone calls from agents and
managers who want to represent them.
"Sand Dogs," the winning screenplay,
is about a young, idealistic American who
travels to the highly volatile war zone of
Gaza as a Red Cross ambulance driver.
He befriends a slightly older Palestinian
and starts taking part in border crossings,
eventually getting sucked into a smug-
gling ring.
Although neither writer had direct
experience with the story's events, both
Fletcher and Dewan were attracted to
the concept of an outsider entering into a

world about which he knows nothing.
"Because I'm originally from England,
I'm an American, but I'm also watching
it from the outside. I think when you're
outside a culture you think you can fix it
because you think you know things that
people in the culture don't see," Fletcher
said.
"But the situations are so complicated
that the more you get involved, the more
you find yourself compromising your own
ideals," he added.
"I was attracted by the fact that a good
person wants to help people but he gets
put in a situation where the more he gets
involved,.the more he's forced to compro-
mise."
Reception to the script has been over-
whelmingly positive.
"It's a thriller, a war movie, a charac-
ter study - it was described last night at
the awards ceremony as a coming-of-age
story," Beal said.
"Believe it nor not, my major (at Michi-
gan) was actually cellular and molecular

Speaking like
grown-ups

ear Reader,
I know my given title
inThe Michigan Daily
is "Political Satire Columnist,"
but this week,
we've gone
through the
looking glass.
I'm afraid the
bizarro right-
wing me usu-
ally found in
these margins ZACH
and the real me SMILOVMTZ
actually agree.
More unfortunately, we're not
alone.
A few months ago, I began
writing this column and started
off with a few pot-shots at a
pretty easy target: former Alaska
governor Sarah Palin. At the
time, though I don't doubt you
recall, the Thrilla from Wasilla
was oddly auctioning off a dinner
with herself and Todd on eBay.
This, I thought, would be a pretty
good place to start. If you had any
affection for or agreed with Sarah
Palin on pretty much any issue,
this column wasn't going to be
for you.
So in researching this week's
piece, which I knew would be
about President Barack Obama
and his announcement of a new
Afghan war strategy, I went about
trying to form an opinion on the
matter. I made all the usual news
and opinion rounds, hearing from
eggheads like Thomas Friedman
and George Will and watching as
much cable news as is currently
legal in the state. One source
for information, and oftentimes
comic gold, is the much-anticipat-
ed Sarah Palin Facebook posts.
Following the president's speech
Tuesday night announcing the
troop escalation, former governor
Palin let her feelings on the mat-
ter be known.
Unfortunately, I pretty much
agreed with her at every turn.
"President Obama decided to
give his military commanders
much of what they need to accom-
plish their mission in Afghani-
stan. In the end, he decided to
endorse a'surge' for Afghanistan,
applying the counterinsurgency
principles of'clear, hold and
build' that worked so well in Iraq.
Given that he opposed the surge
in Iraq, it is even more welcome
that he now supports a surge in
Afghanistan," Palin wrote.
It can't be. Not a semester ago
I thought her the GOP's equiva-
lent of Michael Scott and now,
aside from a few pot-shots of her
own against Obama, her think-
ing couldn't be more in line with
mine. What's going on?
It's rare to see the political
stars align as uniquely as they
have since Obama's address to
the nation from West Point. In
announcing his Afghan troop
increase, the president was able
to complete a remarkable cross-
party Mibius strip, uniting both
the anti-any-war left and pro-
any-war right in a celebration of
themselves and condemnation of
the president. Like some kind of
bi-partisan key party, the likes of
Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly
found common ground in their
own self-righteousness. I guess
it's true: politics often make
strange, and physically unappeal-
ing, bedfellows.
Naturally, each side of the
political divide had its own grum-

blings about the president's order
for 30,000 more soldiers on the
ground starting at the end of this
year. Some on the right faulted
the president for not speak-
ing forcefully for victory while
those against the troop surge
wished they had heard a quicker
proposed rate of American with-
drawal. Moore and others believe
resolutely that more blood spilled
and treasure spent in Afghani-
stan is done in vain. Without a
reliable or legitimate partner in
Kabul, or the wide support of the
Afghan people, those against the
surge see flashes of the Vietnam
war and the Soviet experience
in a land that sent Alexander the
Great home in shame. They tell
the president the best course is
one of retreat and consolation
with the attackers and enablers of
the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
I just can't bring myself to agree

with them.
It isn't my habit or pleasure to
find common ground with Palin
or Henry Kissinger, whom, in an
earlier column, I inferred was a
war criminal. But after listening
to President Obama's mature and
reasoned argument for greater
American involvement, ol' HK
and I were on the same side.
"(The surge) is important for
the reasons President Obama
mentioned: the danger that oth-
erwise Afghanistan becomes
another headquarters for al-Qae-
da operations. Also, it's important
for the stability of Pakistan, cru-
cial for the stability of Pakistan
I think the policy that was
announced today deserves sup-
port and the reasons given for it
deserve support," the one-time
war criminal said on Fox News.
For me, this is not nation-
building; it's fighting the real
danger of a resurgent Taliban
and its al-Qaeda allies. Yeah, it's
a bitter pill to swallow, but that's
governing. You think Obama
wants to fight a two-ocean public
opinion war on both health care
and an escalation in Afghanistan?
or does he have the solemn job of
seeing problems this country has
to face immediately and facing
them. I don't think the president
is gauche enough to choose to
tackle both a 100-year American
health care problem and finish-
ing the war President George W.
Bush chose to forget just for his
ego.
In many points during the
Obama's speech, he turned the
thoughts oflistening Americans
to the voice of our country's his-
tory. He cited the promise that
has been made and the example
that is set by a government of the
people, for the people, and by the
people. He turned our thoughts
to our country as it entered the
Second World War, a war my
grandparents, who survived Hit-
ler's Final Solution, are grateful to
the United States for entering. He
turned our minds to Sept. 11, 2001
as the first point in the historical
moment in which we find our-
selves. He spoke of the great reli-
gion of Islam and its perversion
by al-Qaeda and like-minded sup-
porters. He spoke to the Afghan
people. He spoke to the American
people. He spoke to the world.
America's track record as a
global superpower in the last 50
years has not always been spot-
less but it has created the greatest
opportunities the human race has
ever had for peace and prosper-
ity. Obama is deserving of every
ounce of our scrutiny and testing,
but those like Dick Cheney who
chose to attack the commander-
in-chief on the eve of sending our
troops into battle, an attack made
merely for political gain, deserve
neither our respect nor consider-
ation.
It's yet to be seen whether
Obama will be able to weather
the rough seas he has chosen to
try to conquer in his first term.
Sarah Palin and
I seem to be on
the same page.
Now that evangelical folk hero
Mike Huckabee has all but called

himself out of the 2012 presi-
dential race, Palin seems to be
locking down all the Republican
constituencies that would win her
the nomination: the half of the
GOP that doesn't believe in taxes
and the half that doesn't believe
in evolution. I doubt she would be
much of a challenge for Obama in
2012; the same can be said for the
rest of the current slate of Repub-
lican presidential contenders. But
whoever will lead this country for
the next four, eight or 100 years,
I only hope that he or she will be
able to do what Obama did Tues-
day night: make an unpopular
decision that needs to be made, all
the while speaking to the country
like grown-ups.

should stand as testament
to fiction's ability to broaden
our understanding of different cultures.
Akpan, the newest featured author of Oprah's
Book Club and a 2006 University of Michigan
Master of Fine Arts graduate, is scheduled to
appear tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the Hatcher Grad-
uate Library to talk about his book.
Akpan's own story is almost as fascinating as
his fiction. He's a fully ordained Jesuit Catholic
priest hailing from the small Nigerian village of
Ikot Akpan Eda who still preaches in his home
country when not touring with his book. After
living in Nebraska in the mid '90s, he decided to
apply to Michigan's MFA program because of a
haphazard Google search for creative writing
programs in the Midwest. He entered the pro-
gram with much of "Say You're One of Them"
already written.
"We had a workshop each week for three
hours. It was here that I finally understood how
to create tangible conflict in my work, how to
pace the stories, how to sharpen the dialogue,
how to manage perspectives," Akpan wrote in

an e-mail interview. "Whatever I learnt from
the wo:kshops, I went back and applied to the
stories."
Akpan's semi-finished stories showed he
came to Michigan with the goal of publishing,
and he knew he had a lot of polishing to do.
Eileen Pollack, head of the Creative Writing
department, taughtAkpan in a fiction workshop
and immediately realized his potential.
"He came in with this huge amount of pages
- these very rough, very long manuscripts that
eventually became the stories and novellas that
are in the book," Pollack said.
Among those drafts was an early version of
"An Ex-Mas Feast," a story about a 12-year-old
girl who must work as a prostitute to support
her destitute Kenyan family. This story pro-
pelled Akpan into the upper reaches of the lit-
erary world when it was published in The New
Yorker in June 2005.
In creative writing workshops, Pollack helped
Akpan tighten up his stories by focusing more
on the ordeals of one relatable character than
the turmoil of an entire country. She also helped
him develop his own unique point of view on the
events his stories cover.
"You can't just write from the point of view
that genocide's terrible. I mean, we know that,"
Pollack said. "You have to have a particular
question about what's happening to your char-
acter. And you're writing from that question, not
from something you already know."
The five stories in "Say You're One of Them"
are set in several African countries including
Kenya, Ethiopia, Benin and Rwanda during
the time of the nation's genocides. Akpan had
not traveled to many of these locations before
he started writing, but be performed massive
research to accurately reflect their customs and
dialects.
"Africa has 52 countries and myriads of cul-
tures and ethnic groups. But we Africans do not
necessarily know what is happening in other
parts of Africa," Akpan wrote. "The pidgin
English spoken in Nigeria is decidedly differ-

ent from that spoken in, say, Kenya. The people
of Senegal may not know what is happening in
Sudan and vice versa.
Pollack put it more succinctly: "Just because
somebody is African doesn't mean he knows
every country (and) every region in Africa."
Pollack recalled an early draft of a story set in
Ethiopia in which characters lived in tall build-
ings and flew kites. itwasn't until Akpan visited
Ethiopia that he discovered none of the coun-
try's buildings exceed two stories and it's practi-
cally the only place in Africa where nobody flies
kites.
The main challenge facing Akpan was com-
municating the diverse struggles of Africa to
readers who were not familiar with the conti-
nent.
"I had to write in such a way that whoever
read the book would flow with the spirit of the
stories, without necessarily understanding
every word," he wrote.
But writing stories to address these Afri-
can struggles was an important challenge for
him to meet, and one he was more than ready
to accept. And he's already found immense
success. In addition to the exposure he's got-
ten from Oprah, "Say You're One of Them" has
received numerous other awards and topped
many critics' year-end best lists for 2008.
Akpan is particularly proud to have won the
Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First
Book for the African region.
Recently, Akpan has been surprised by the
astounding accomplishments of his first book,
and slightly exhausted by the busy promotional
schedule.
"I travel lots these days. That is grueling," he
wrote. "But I am thankful to God. It is better
than shopping around with a manuscript."
A good dozen of the stories Akpan showed
Pollack at Michigan didn't make it into the
book, including a long piece about child sol-
diers in Uganda. Since he's currently one of the
hottest names in literature, it's likely these sto-
ries won't stay hidden for long.

Death Cab for Cutie have record-

Recording budgets vary great-
ly. Rates in Ann Arbor can run
over $100 per hour, and for local
artists, the price can seem quite
daunting.
To save money, many musicians
record parts at home. Michael

a vocalist recorded at home and
e-mailed him the vocal track,
thus saving hours of recording
time in the studio. Michael said
that drums take a longer time
to record because of set-up and

attached to recording time.
Saltiel was wont to spend less
time at the studio, but not at the
expense of performance quality.
"Practically speaking, the one
thing that's imperative is buffer
time. You need to have the space
to take longer than you expect-
ed," Saltiel says. "It's very stress-
I ful to try to rush the process. We
tried our best to go quickly, but
we all defaulted to an extremely
t high standard, so it took a long
time to get it right."
The pressure of recording
under a tight schedule inevitably
took a toll on Saltiel.
"It got right down to the wire,
t and I even got sick because I
was barely sleeping. We actually
ended up recording the last vocal

last song," Saltiel says. "That's
not something I ever want to do

learn. Next time I'm sure
it'll be totally different."
All the bits and pieces of
the recording process - the
fixation on mic positioning,
agonizing over the right gear
as well the cost and the long,
painstaking hours- finally
comes together to create a fin-

biology," Fletcher said. "I had this desire to go and
study literature because I had so much science back-
ground."
Still, even in his undergraduate years, Fletcher
immersed himself in literature, and even won a
Hopwood Award for his poetry.
In his freshman year, he was also a member of the
Marine Corps ROTC, going down to boot camp for
10 weeks.
"But then the University of Michigan gave me a
full scholarship - I think it was actually an astron-
omy scholarship, even though I never did any
astronomy," Fletcher said. "So in the end, I didn't
need the military money, (and) I didn't need to join
the armed services. And so I thought, I'm kind of
a nerd; I probably wouldn't have done well in the
military anyway. I'll take the astronomy scholar-
ship."
Following his graduation from Michigan, Fletch-
er went to Yale to get his PhD in English. He became
a fellow at Stanford University teaching in the Eng-
lish Department and then made the transition to
theater a couple years ago.
Fletcher is currentlya tenured assistant professor
of theater at the University of Southern California.
He believes his theater background helped him con-
struct a screenplay with strong characters.
"(Theater) is such an amazing actor's medium.
There's a sense that people always want to watch
other people," Fletcher said. "And the more you
learn about them, the more interesting and power-
ful and eclectic their personality is."

Fletcher cites Michigan as one of the best experi-
ences of his life.
"(Michigan) leads you to believe you can do any-
thing you want," he said. "It's such a big school, and
there are so many talented and interesting people
and you kind of have to find your own way. When
I left Michigan, it made me feel really empowered
because I had this whole community of people to fall
back on. My whole sense of openness to new experi-
ences - that all comes from Michigan."
In the future, Fletcher and Dewan both want to
continue working in the film industry. "Vineet actu-
ally wants to direct ('Sand Dogs'), which would be
kind of exciting. I love writing for film, so I want to
continue with that, but I'm also interested in writ-
ing for TV," Fletcher said.
Already, Fletcher has finished writing a new
script about a woman who steals a drug that treats
AIDS from a pharmaceutical company and then
smuggles the medicine into South Africa. Still, he
says he would like to stay on at the School of Theater
at USC.
"The great thing about theater is that it's is fun
and experimental and recharging," he said. "I love
working with students and all the energy they bring.
The thing about writing is that you're by yourself, in
a dark hole. It's like two sides of your personality."
Fletcher believes that to truly write, one must
experience other things first.
"If anyone's thinking about being a writer, you
can't really be a writer at 20 because you haven't
really done much. You may think you have, but I'm
now in my early30s, and I spent a lot of my 20s doing
stuff - I was in the military and science and I've
been doing things overseas. You just see a lot of dif-
ferent things and it gives you a deeper sense of the
world," Fletcher said.
