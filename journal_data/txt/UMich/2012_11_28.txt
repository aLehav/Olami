Ruling denies
injunction request
to withhold results
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
After a three-hour hearing,
the Central Student Judiciary
ruled against the - injunction

filed by Central Student Govern-
ment against Rackham Student
Government, effectively main-
taining a non-binding question
for graduate students regarding
RSG secession on the election
ballot.,
The question surveys if grad-
uate students would be in sup-
port of examining what a newly
formed, graduate student-only
government separate from CSG

would look like. While the CSG
election and other student gov-
ernment elections are already
underway, the results ofthe non-
binding question could have
been enjoined by CSJ, meaning
the results of the election would
never be made public.
Since the election concludes
Wednesday at midnight, the
injunction was separated into
pressing and non-pressing mat-

ters, with a second hearing
slated for another time to dis-
cuss non-pressing issues. The
parts of the injunction that CSJ
agreed to hear included RSG's
involvement in violating the
submission deadline for bal-
lot questions in its own bylaws
and CSG's compiled code and
whether "irreparable harm"
was caused by the question's

Poltical scientists
discuss party
polarization
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
Though University students
often have the opportunity
to hear from a wide range of
political persuasions, attendees
of an event hosted by the Ford
School of Public Policy had the
chance to discuss American
politics with governmental
experts that lean toward the
radical side.
Thomas Mann and Norman
Ornstein, political scientists
and University alumni,,exam-
ined how partisan polarization
in Congress is plaguing the
American government during
a discussion on Tuesday at the
Michigan Union. Both men find
two primary problems endan-
gering the American politi-
cal system: polarized political

parties inhibiting action and
unequal responsibilities of each
side. They said these issues cre-
ate "asymmetric polarization,"
a situation in which Republi-
cans deny Democrats anything
that may help them politically
at any cost.
"They have become ideo-
logically extreme, contentious
of the inherited policy regime
going all the way back to Roo-
sevelt - and I mean Theodore,
not Franklin - scornful of com-
promise, skeptical of facts, of
evidence, of science, and simply
dismissive of the legitimacy of
the political opposition," Mann
said.
Public approval ratings for
Congress are currently at an
all-time low and Democrats
and Republicans have increas-
ingly struggled to compromise
on the nation's critical issues.
Mann and Ornstein said they
believe Republicans have
become more extreme and
opposed to recognized social

Students gainmarketing skills

For the Michigan Adver-
tising and Marketing club,
giving members hands-on
experience working with real
marketing clients is critical.
Founded in 2007, MAM
consists of 100 active mem-
bers who work in teams to
create and plan distribu-
tion of advertisements for
a wide range of organiza-
tions, including other stu-
dent organizations and local'
Ann Arbor businesses. Each
group, comprised of about
five to eight students, works
with one of the club's 13 cli-
ents for the entire academic
year.
LSA senior Anusha Stha-

nunathan, president of
MAM, said due to the large
size of the club, each team
sets their own weekly meet-
ing time.
"Our executive board
meets every Sunday, and we
try to meet at a different loca-
tion every time to change the
pace of our meeting," Stha-
nunathan said. "Our last two
meetings have been at Cafe
Zola and Sava's."
Sthanunathan said the
recruiting process consists of
an online application and in-
person interviews. She added
that MAM is open to students
of all academic majors and
years, and the interdisciplin-

ary nature of the club pro-
motes individual growth.
In addition to working
with clients, MAM hosts cor-
porate events and workshops
to provide mentorship for its
members and the network-
ing they need to succeed in
careers in marketing and
advertising.
"I've found that MAM
gave me so many avenues
to excel not only within the
club but also in interviews for
companies," Sthanunathan
said. "Using this experience
to showcase how I've grown
as a leader is so incredibly
valuable."

The injunction was filed on
Wednesday, six days before the
start of the election by GSG's stu-
dent legal counsel, LSA senior
Lukas Garske. Garske was joined
by CSG committee chair Jeremy
Keeney, a law student, to repre-
sent the petitioner at the hearing
and RSG president Michael Ben-
son was accompanied by two law
students for counsel. Spectators
included various members of CSG
including Manish Parikh, CSG
president and Business senior, and
several members of RSG's execu-
tive board.
A major point in the hearing
was whether the question submit-
ted by RSG was a "ballotquestion"
or a "referendum," which CSJ
eventually voted in favor of the
latter in a 3-2 decision.
Under the RSG bylaws, bal-
lot questions must be submitted
within 14 days of the election.
However, under another sec-
tion of the bylaws, "referenda"
can be sent out to its constituents
"as (RSG) deems necessary by a
majority vote."

and economic policies, which in
turn has caused citizens to raise
concern with their elected offi-
cials.
Ornstein suggested that
increased public participa-
tion and a restructuring of both
houses of the U.S. Congress
could remedy the problems cur-
rently plaguing Congress. He
said he hopes the media and gen-
eral public will learn to reinforce
positive policies and diminish
deadlocks to ensure a functional
democracy.
"We do believe that some of
the ways out of this are exter-
nal to the Congress or politics
in Washington," Ornstein said.
"First among them, we want to
make voting easier and we want
to enlarge the electorate."
Mann added that party polar-
ization also must be addressed,
and said each party needs to bet-
ter focus their visions and squash
extreme factions like the Tea
Party.

"In the end, it's going to take
voters sefnding signals to the
party that strayed too much
while keeping the other one true
to its mission and its promises
to bring them back to the main-
stream world of American poli-
tics," Mann said. "Without doing
that, nothing can be enacted or
implemented effectively."
Public Policy Dean Susan Col-
lins said she found the session
to be entertaining, particularly
Ornstein's jokes about Big Bird's
"near death experience" dur-
ing the election, in which Mitt
Romney claimed he would cut
funding to PBS programming if
elected during the second presi-
dential debate last month.
"I thought they did an excel-
lent job of summarizing some of
the challenges we are facing, but
also offering some concrete sug-
gestions," Collins said. "And they
did it with some humor as well as
some history."
In addition to being comical,
Collins said Mann and Ornstein
were also easily understood by
the audience.
"Their responses were acces-

sible to students who might not
knoW'much about polittif sIsci-
ence, but may be worried about
what is going on in Congress,"
Collins said. "I liked the extent
to which they went beyond the
book, specifically their discus-
sion of the past election."
Public Policy graduate student
Claire Hutchinson said she was
glad to see University alumni
returning to campus to educate
current students.
"It's awesome that they're
Michigan grads and they're back
and excited to be back," Hutchin-
son said. "It's also really inter-
esting that they're from very
different political think tanks in
terms of ideology, which is great
and interesting and unique. I
could have listened to them talk
all day."
Hutchinson also said she
appreciated their perspective on
Capitol Hill.
"They had a lot of insight as
to where the political gridlock is
occurring and they did a really
great job providing anecdotal
stories about what they're seeing
in D.C. now," Hutchinson said.

The employment picture has
improved across most of Michigan
while worsening in metropolitan
Detroit.
The state said Tuesday that the
seasonally unadjusted jobless rate

from 8.2 percent in September to
8.3 percent in October. The rates
were down in 16 of the state's 17
major labor markets but up 0.5
percentage points in metropolitan
Detroit.
The Department of Technol-

September's 10 percent.
The department says the rate

As takes shrink,
communities try to
save harbors

An employee of the Stock Exchange is reflected in a chart displaying stock prices in Athens on Tuesday. Greece has avied imminet
bankruptcy after its creditors agreed to give it the money it needs, but the country's economic distress is likely to drag on for years to come.
Greece averts bankruptcy
after economic struggjes

Partners and
IMF agree on new
measures, four loan
installments
ATHENS, Greece (AP) -
European and global financial
leaders have agreed to release
644 billion ($57 billion) in criti-
cal loans to Greece and provide
billions in additional debt relief
in order to help the country sta-
bilize its ailing economy.
After three weeks of nego-
tiations, Greece's euro partners
and the International Mone-
tary Fund agreed early Tuesday
morning to release the loans in
four installments beginning
next month. The leaders also
settled on a raft of measures -
including a debt buyback pro-
gram and an interest rate cut
on loans - that will reduce the
country's debts by about 40
billion.
Greek Prime Minister Anto-

nis Samaras hailed the agree-
ment in Brussels as a victory.
"Yesterday, a very grey, a very
dark time for Greece ended
definitively," he said in a tele-
vised address to the nation,
adding that the agreement
"managed to ensure us remain-
ing in the euro."
But the country will still face
years of economic pain as aus-
terity measures agreed to as
part of the bailout package are
implemented.
Most stock markets in
Europe were modestly higher
on the news out of Brussels with
the Stoxx 50 index of leading
European shares closing up 0.2
percent. Meanwhile the euro
gave up earlier gains to trade
0.4 percent lower at $1.2941.
The interest rate charged on
Greece's benchmark 10-year
bonds, an indicator of inves-
tor confidence in a country's
finances, fell .0.2 percentage
points to 14.47 percent on the
news of the debt deal.
"There remains the poten-

tial for this deal to fall apart in
the medium term as there are
a lot of moving parts and it is
a long way away from the per-
manent fix that the IMF had
been insisting upon," said Gary
Jenkins, managing director of
Swordfish Research.
"It is just one more big kick of
the can down the road."
For three years, Greece has
been struggling to convince
markets as well as its creditors
that it can get a grip on its pub-
lic finances, which had spiraled
out of control. The country is
predicted to enter its sixth year
of recession and is weighed
down by an unemployment rate
of 25 percent.
The so-called troika of the
European Central Bank, IMF
and the European Commission
has twice agreed to bail out
Greece, pledging a total of 6240
billion in rescue loans - of
which the country has received
about 6150 billion so far. In
return for its bailout loans,
Greece has had to impose sev-

Great Lakes-towns
preserve small
ports as lake levels
fall below average
ONEKAMA, Mich. (AP) -
For more than a century, easy
access to Lake Michigan has
made Onekama a popular place
for summer visitors and a ref-
uge for boaters fleeing danger-
ous storms. Now the community
itself needs arescue, from slump-
ing lake levels that threaten its
precious link to open water.
The Great Lakes, the world's
biggest freshwater system, are
shrinking because of drought
and rising temperatures, a trend
that accelerated with this year's
almost snowless winter and
scorching summer. Water lev--
els have fallen to near-record
lows on Lakes Michigan and
Huron, while Erie, Ontario and
Superior are below their his-
torical averages. The decline is
causing heavy economic losses,
with cargo freighters forced to
lighten their loads, marinas too
shallow for pleasure boats and
weeds sprouting on exposed
bottomlands, chasing away
swimmers and sunbathers.
Some of the greatest suffering
is in small tourist towns that lack
the economic diversity of bigger
port cities. Yet they are last in
line for federal money to deepen
channels and repair infrastruc-
ture to support the boating traf-
fic thatkeeps them afloat.
"How do you like our mud
bog?" Township Supervisor
Dave Meister asked on a recent
afternoon, gesturing toward the
shoreline of Portage Lake, part
of a 2,500-acre inland waterway
that connects Onekama to Lake
Michigan. A wide expanse that
normally would be submerged is

now an ugly patchwork of pud-
dles, muck and thick stands of
head-high cattails. A grounded
pontoon boat rested forlornly
alongside a deserted dock.
The Army Corps of Engineers
has estimated that about 30
small Great Lakes harbors will
need attention in the next couple
of years.
In bygone days, friendly
members of Congress would slip
money into the federal budgetto
dredge a harbor. But so-called
earmarks have fallen out of
favor, leaving business and civic
leaders wondering where to
turn. A desperate few are raising
money locally for dredging but
insist they can't afford it on a
regular basis.
Tourism has sustained
Onekama since the early 1900s,
when northwestern Michigan
coastal towns became popular
with wealthy visitors from Chi-
cago, Milwaukee and Detroit.
On a typical summer day, the
community's marinas are
crowded with yachts, speed-
boats and fishing charters.
But the falling water levels
are taking a toll, illustrating how
extensively the health of the
Great Lakes affects the economy
of a region that is home to more
than 30 million people extending
from Minnesota to New York.
Lake Michigan's level at the
end of October was more than
2 feet below its long-term aver-
age. The Corps of Engineers
says without heavy snowfall this
winter, the lake may decline to
its lowest point since record-
keepingbegan in 1918.
The channel that connects
Portage Lake and Lake Michi-
gan is now about 7 feet deep at
best. When the water is choppy,
some vessels can hit bottom. If
things get much worse, Oneka-
ma may be effectively cut off
from the biglake.

Insurgent attacks kill 30,
wound dozens in Iraq

Parked cars explode
simulataneously
minutes later
BAGHDAD (AP) - Insur-
gents launched attacks against
security forces and civilians in
central and northern Iraq on
Tuesday, killing at least 30 peo-
ple and wounding dozens, offi-
cials said.
Shiite mosques in Baghdad
were main targets, along with
a city claimed by squabbling
ethnic groups in a disputed
northern region. The conflicts
threaten the stability of Iraq fol-
lowing the final pullout of U.S.
military forces nearly a year ago.
Car bombs exploded near
three mosques shortly after
nightfall in the capital, killing
21. Police and hospital officials
said the first exploded near a
Shiite mosque following evening
prayers in the Hurriyah neigh-
borhood, killing nine worship-
pers and wounding 20 others.
Minutes later, another car bomb
went off near Gaereat mosque,
killing five people.
Later, police said a third car
bomb exploded, killing seven
Shiite worshippers and wound-
ing 21 others in Shula neighbor-
hood in northern.Baghdad.
Ali Habib, a taxi driver, said
he was driving near the Shiite
mosque in Hurriyah when he
heard aloudexplosion.Herushed
to the blast site and helped take
wounded to the hospital.
"The scene was horrific, with
people screaming for help," he
said. "Such attacks bring back
memories of the darkest days of
sectarian strife that took place
several years ago in Iraq."
In the north, a police officer
said three bombs in parked cars
exploded simultaneously in the
oil-rich city of Kirkuk, the larg-
est city in the area claimed by
several ethnic groups in a dis-
pute with the central govern-
ment in Baghdad.
The bombs hit two Kurdish
residential areas in the center
of the city. One went off near a
main Kurdish party headquar-
ters. Five people, including a

Kurdish security guard, were
killed and 58 others wounded,
he said.
A few minutes later, two
bombs exploded in a market in
the Sunni-dominated town of
Hawija west of Kirkuk, killing
two civilians and wounding five
others, he said. Also, five Iraqi
army soldiers were wounded
when militants detonated bombs
near their houses in the nearby
town of Tuz Khortmato.
Kirkuk, 290 kilometers (180
miles) north of Baghdad, is home
to a mix of Arabs, Kurds and
Turkomen, who all have com-
petingclaims to the oil-rich area.
The Kurds want to incorporate
it into their self-ruled region
in Iraq's north, but Arabs and
Turkomen are opposed.
Violence has ebbed since
the peak of insurgency several
years ago, but lethal attacks
still occur frequently. No one
claimed responsibility for Tues-
day's attacks, but car bombs,
shootings and roadside devices
are the hallmark of al-Qaida in
Iraq.
In the northeastern province
of Diyala, gunmen in a speed-
ing car showered a checkpoint
manned by Sahwa, an anti-
al-Qaida group, with bullets,
killing one and wounding two
others, another police offi-
cial said. The Sahwa are Sunni
Arabs who joined forces with
the U.S. military to fight al-
Qaida at the height of Iraq's
insurgency. They have since
been favorite targets for Sunni
insurgents who consider them
traitors.
Also in Diyala, a -roadside
bomb targeted a passing police
patrol in the town of Khan Bani
Saad, killing a civilian bystand-
er and wounding two police-
men, the officer said. The town
is about 35 kilometers (20 miles)
north of Baghdad.
In the northern city of Mosul,
a parked car bomb went off
near a house of a Sunni law-
maker, wounding five bystand-
ers. The lawmaker, a woman,
was unharmed, another police
officer said. Mosul is 360 kilo-
meters (225 miles) northwest of
Baghdad.

Officials hail step
to liquidate results
of world's worst
nuclear disaster
CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR
POWER STATION, Ukraine
(AP) - Workers have raised the
first section of a colossal arch-
shaped structure that eventually
will cover the exploded nuclear
reactor at the Chernobyl power
station.
Project officials on Tuesday
hailed the raising as a signifi-
cant step in a complex effort to
clean up the consequences of the
1986 explosion, the world's worst
nuclear accident. Upon comple-
tion, the shelter will be moved on
tracks over the building contain-
ing the destroyed reactor, allow-
ing work to begin on dismantling
the reactor and. disposing of
radioactive waste.
Suma Chakrabati, president
of the European Bank for Recon-
struction and Development,
which is leading the project,
called Tuesday "a very signifi-
cant milestone, which is a trib-
ute to the ongoing commitment
of the international donor com-
munity, and an important step
towards overcoming the legacy
of the accident."

The shelter, shaped like a gar-
gantuan Quonset hut, will be 257
meters by 150 meters (843 feet by
492 feet) when completed and at
its apex will be higher than the
Statue of Liberty.
The April 26, 1986, accident
in the then-Soviet republic of
Ukraine sent a cloud of radioac-
tive fallout over much of Europe
and forced the evacuation of
about 115,000 people from the
plant's vicinity. A 30-kilometer
(19-mile) area directly around
the plant remains largely off-
limits and the town of Pripyat,
where the plant's workers once
lived, today is a ghostly ruin of
detefiorating apartment towers.
At least 28 people have died
of acute radiation sickness from
close exposure to the shattered
reactor and more than 6,000
cases of thyroid cancer have
been detected in people who, as
children or adolescents, were
exposed to high levels of fallout
after the blast.
Officials who showed report-
ers around the construction site
Tuesday were clearly delighted at
the colossus taking shape before
them, but concerned about the
challenges ahead. The shelter
is to be moved over the reactor
building by the end of 2015 - a
deadline that no one wants to
miss given that the so-called sar-
cophagus hastily built over the

reactor building after the 1986
explosion has an estimated ser-
vice life of about 30 years.
The arch now under construc-
tion is only one of two segments
that will eventually form the
shelter, and so far it's only been
raised to a height of 22 meters
(72 feet). More structural ele-
ments have to be added before
it reaches its full height of 108
meters (354 feet), and the work
so far has taken seven months.
"There's no room for error ...
the schedule is very tight," said
Vince Novak, director of the
EBRD's nuclear safety depart-
ment, who added that staying
within budget is also a concern.
The overall shelter project is
budgeted at 1.54 billion ($2 bil-
lion) - 61 billion ($1.3 billion) of
that for the structure itself - and
much uncertainty lies ahead. One
particular concern is dismantling
the plant's chimney, which must
be taken down before the shel-
ter is put in place. The chimney
is lined with radioactive residue
that could break up and enter the
atmosphere as it is taken apart.
Laurin Dodd, managing director
of the shelter project manage-
ment group, said some sort of
fixative will have to be applied to
the chimney's interior.
"This is one of the most chal-
lenging parts, because it's an
unknown," he said.

Suggested secession
CSG and RSG's interests don't always align
Central Student Government's fall elections end tomor-
row. One particularly contentious issue on the ballot could
change how these elections are held for the foreseeable
future. In September, Rackham Student Government - the gradu-
ate student branch of CSG - proposed using the ballot to survey
whether or not graduate students, and other graduate student orga-
nizations, would be interested in having RSG secede from CSG.
While the ballot question is non-binding and is solely to gauge stu-
dent interest, it did not arrive on the ballot without contention. Now
that this questions is presented, students should seriously consider
if CSG is an effective body. A split may be the most beneficial option
for both organizations and students.

Time to tone down the crazy

he 2012 Presidential Elec-
tion was full of surprises. A
race that

every political
pundit or news

ida's votes even

were more surprised than leaders in
the Republican Party. Independent
conservative groups spent more than
$700 million on the election, only to
see their candidate lose. Karl Rove
couldn't even bring himself to believe
it at first.
But, was it really that unbeliev-
able? Mitt Romney's campaign, along
with the extreme right wing of the
Republican Party, managed to alien-
ate women, minorities, young people
and low-income people all in the
same election cycle. From Romney's
comments about the 47 percent and
"self-deportation" of undocumented
immigrants to Republican Senate
candidate Todd Akin and Richard
Murdock's comments on rape, this
election saw some of the most outra-
geous political rhetoric to date.
The fact of the matter is that the
demographics of this nation are
changing. President Barack Obama
only won 39 percent of white voters,
and yet still managed to win the elec-
tion. During the last few elections,
Democrats have established a strong
base of minority support, and this
group is only growing.
In 2008, Asian Americans made
up 2 percent of the population; in
just four years they've grown to 3
percent, and 47 percent voted for
Obama. In 2008, Hispanics made
up 15 percent of the electorate - in
2012 they contributed 17 percent,
with 60 percent favoring Obama. As
this election reaffirmed, there simply
aren't enough white men to propel
a candidate to an electoral victory
nowadays.
The changingdemographics ofthe
country will continue to put Repub-
licans at an electoral disadvantage

unless they broaden their party's
appeal. Today, minorities make up 30
percent of the U.S. population, but by
2050 they are estimated to exceed 50
percent.
Not only are the numbers of
minorities in the United States grow-
ing, but people are becoming more
moderate on social issues. According
to a study by the Pew Research Cen-
ter, compared to older generations,
Millenials are less likely to identify
with any particular religious affilia-
tion. Twenty-six percent of Milleni-
als identified as nothavingareligious
affiliation, the highest among any of
the previous generations. In 1990, 86
percent of the population identified
as Christian; in 2008, it decreased to
76 percent.
This then translates into their
social and political views as well. As
the study reiterated, young people
are more likely to be accepting of
homosexuality and believe in evolu-
tion as a valid explanation for human
life.
while young people still make up
a modest part of the population as
compared to the Baby Boomer gener-
ation, these numbers show a signifi-,
cant shift in mindset. They reiterate
that societyingeneral, and especially
those born today, are less likely to
adhere to strict religious values and
more likely to be open and flexible
in their positions on social issues.
The ongoingshift away from religion
toward science means that many of
the GOP's positions on issues such
as gay marriage, abortion or climate
change are becoming outdated.
An op-ed by a member of the Col-
lege Republicans in the Wall Street
Journal claimed the GOP is viewed
as the "party of the rich" and "social
bigots" by the young voting popu-
lation. She went on to state, "As a
member of this all-important demo-
graphic, I know that neither I, nor
(almost) anybody else coming of age
today supports the Republican social
agenda. That's the way the country is
moving - so just deal with it. Mod-
ernize and prioritize."
And perhapsthat's the lessonhere.
The Republican Party has to mod-
ernize. And thankfully so. As a lib-
eral - albeit a moderate liberal'- I'm
overjoyed that the Republican Party

is doing some soul searching. Don't
get me wrong - election 2012 Was
thoroughly entertaining. Crazy rhet-
oric from the extreme right, regurgi-
tated by Republicans in public office,
was a political goldmine for liberals.
It was hard not to capitalize on Todd
Akin's comments about rape or U.S.
Rep. Michelle Bachmann's (R-Minn.)
comments about Muslims.
Outrageous
rhetoric prevents
serious policy
debates.
But, that's exactly what the prob-
lem is. This nationfaces some serious
issues in almost every area - wheth-
er that's rebuilding our workforce,
educating our youth for a globally
competitive job market or fixing a
broken economic and political sys-
tem. These issues require us to have
serious conversations and debates.
And that can't happen if one of the
two political parties in our nation is
seen as beinghijacked bynonsensical
extremists.
Republicans gave Democrats an
easy pass in November. The election
turned into a conversation about the
47 percent, Big Bird and rape. Obama
didn't have to propose innovative
policy solutions or even answer seri-
ous questions about his vision for the
country moving forward. Instead, he
was simply able to turn the conversa-
tion to some newly crazy statement
by Romney and other Republican
public officials.
That might be how elections are
won. But it's not how problems are
solved. If we want to move forward,
we need strong credible argu-
ments from both sides of the politi-
cal spectrum. And the sooner the
Republican Party distances itself
from crazy rhetoric, the sooner
everyone will be forced to have
serious policy debates.

CSG is an organization for the students of
this University, and therefore this question
should not have been contended. Students at
all levels should have the chance to voice their
opinion on an issue regarding their govern-
ing power. The issue of the legal time frame
for proposing a question is more of an excuse
than a serious consideration. CSG finally
made the right decision to put the question on
the ballot. It's extremely important to gauge
graduate students's opinions on this issue as
their tuition dollars are also goingtoward the
funding of this organization.
CSG alleges that RSG - which officially
submitted the question for the ballot on Nov.
15 - failed to bring the issue up within the
14-days prior deadline. At the most, RSG
missed this deadline by a mere two days.
Furthermore, it's unclear whether the 14-day
deadline corresponds to the start or the end
of the voting period. These rules should be
clarified to avoid similar issues in the future.
CSG receives $7.19 per student, every
semester. However, much of it is spent on
projects that are more directly beneficial for
undergraduate students. Organizations such

as the Detroit Partnership, the Raas Associa-
tion and the South Asian Awareness Network
receive more activity from undergraduate
memberships, and are apportioned more
funding than graduate student organiza-
tions. While CSG has made steps to reach out
to graduate students with funding - citing a
recent $35,000 pledge to childcare funding
used primarily by graduate students - there
simply isn't enough being done to address
their needs. Were this split to take place,
the money going toward CSG would also be
divided, allotting RSG with a fund to better
address graduate interests.
This divide certainly shouldn't promote
bad relations between graduate and under-
graduate students, or CSG and RSG. In the
end, we are all students of the University
of Michigan. However, it's a plain fact that
undergraduate and graduate students have
different priorities. Our student government
should work as hard as it can toreflect these
diverging interests. Even if they won't work
under the same umbrella, CSG and RSG will
still be workingtogether tovoice the needs of
all 40,000 students at this University.

In his feature story on Chris Floyd, "When
the Lights Go Off," Ben Estes writes: "From
talking to his former teammates,. Floyd says
that some ex-Wolverines feel 'used' by the
program.' Estes' feel good story wants to
have it both ways, at once telling the poignant
stories of "the more forgotten players (men
like Floyd)" while at the same time valorizing
the Michigan Career and Professional Tran-
sition Program: "Should M-PACT continue
to gain strength, perhaps those 'souls' won't
ever lose their way."
What we have here is another instance
of subtle exploitation of players, as a way of
lauding the Michigan Athletic Department.
Had nothing more been said, the story would
have passed with the munificence of the Ath-
letic Department intact. But as with all sto-
ries, there is another side. That other side
came with the publication of Chris Floyd's
follow-up editorial (Leave no man behind,
11/20/12) in which he commented, "To say
I was disappointed would be an understate-
ment - but if you want a story told right, you
should tell it yourself."
In Floyd's piece he writes, "[what] many
of us have in common is the feeling that the
athletic department we care so much about
no longer cares for us." Imagine that. The
very idea that the University sees the foot-
ball team as a cash cow where the players are
cogs in a money-making machine that deems
them expendable when they either are hurt
or graduate. Sometimes they don't even have
to graduate before they're kicked to the curb.
Having taught the three "lost souls" alluded
to in the Daily, Floyd, Marcus Ray and Sam
Sword, along with many other athletes, I was
pleased and proud that Floyd's rhetorical
skills were in fine form. His op-ed showed

"ethos" (his experience. as a player), "logos"
(a logic borne of his close reading of Estes'
essay) and "pathos" (a passionate conviction
for the subject at hand).
But I digress. What I really want to talk
about is the treatment of another former stu-
dent of mine: Denard Robinson.
When asked about Devin Gardner (another
former student) being pressed into service as
a wide receiver, Hoke's response was that he
wanted his best 11 players on the field. Okay,
coach. I assume that having Denard stand on
the sidelines with his hands on his hips for
the last three minutes of the Ohio State game
means he doesn't count as one of those 11 -
never mind that Robinson is one of the best 11
players in the country.
I, for one, was sick at seeing this. All per-
sonal feelings aside, Denard Robinson is
Michigan's best running back. Additionally,
even though Denard can't throw the ball
with full strength, he could certainly throw
a short ball to the flat, or pitch the ball on the
run. But forget the strategy part. Denard has
made every sacrifice in putting University
football first. To not have him on the field in
the waning moments of the biggest game of
the year was unconscionable - a slap in the
face to a guy who's given it all.
Shame on you, Brady Hoke. And Borges'
role? Hoke is the head coach, and this is one
instance where he should have over-ruled his
offensive coordinator. Here's Hoke's quote
from Monday's press conference following
the game: "I thought the play calling was
exactly what it should have been." Oh, really,
coach?
Randall Tessier is a lecturer in the English
Department and Comprehensive Studies Program.

For students at the University
who need to be productive -
that is, all
of us - there's no
shortage of tech-
nology available.
Though paper
and pencil is
still the stan-
dard for note-
taking, many ERIC
students use
applications like FERGUSON
Microsoft Word
or Google's pro-
cessing suite to take notes and do
schoolwork.
This technology can be used in
non-school related applications, as
well. The collaborative capability
of Google Docs, especially, makes
it an attractive program for groups
working on presentations and
housemates looking to keep track of
finances, as well as enabling access
to documents at any computer for
those who don't want to lug a laptop
around. Forthose ofus who are leery
of storing all of our files in the cloud
but would still like to back them up
to access remotely through another
device, free subscriptions to cloud
services let students specify certain
file types on their hard drive for
backup and retrieval in the cloud.
The variety and versatility of
these web-centered services is
remarkable. Their introduction
and widespread use, though, begs
a rather obscure but constitution-
ally important question: if you use
one of these services, how does
existing electronic privacy legisla-
tion protect your content against
government search and seizure?
The Senate is set to vote on a bill

sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) that would majorly amend
the Electronic Communications
and Privacy Act, which has served
as the basis of privacy policy but is
overwhelmingly outdated. Though
the bill's final text hasn't been
released yet, it will likely spell out
what forms of electronic communi-
cation law enforcement needs war-
rants to access. Policy in the United
States is unclear as Google Docs,
Twitter and text messages weren't
part of the equation when the origi-
nal legislation was passed 20 years
ago - leading to heated debates on
what should be protected and not.
Though Leahy retracted some of
the bill's more controversial provi-
sions after withering opposition,
particularly from the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Cen-
ter for Democracy and Technology,
the privacy of electronic commu-
nications is still in question. Under
the Patriot Act, some law enforce-
ment can gain access to electronic
communications by asserting that
the information they want access to
is relevant to an ongoing investiga-
tion. But, it has been 11 years since
that piece of legislation was passed,
and both the programs used to track
electronic communications and the
communications themselves have
advanced considerably. Moreover,
that law enforcement can get access
to these electronic communica-
tions with no more than a subpoena
may be a violation of the Fourth
Amendment, which states that "the
right of the people to be secure ...
against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and
no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause."

There needs to be a substantial
overhaul of privacy law pertaining
to electronic communications, and
it needs tobe done in a way that can
make the law catch up with current
technology and have it remain rel-
evant as that technology evolves.
That way, users of emerging tech-
nology can be assured that their
communications, in whatever form,
are secure.
New technology
may require
re-evaluation of
old legislation.
Granted, law enforcement needs
to be able to do their job, and hav-
ing the ability to intercept electronic
communications is necessary in this
day and age. However, giving them
that ability without having to show
probable cause represents a weaken-
ing of privacy protection that should
give all Internet-savvy students
pause. If law enforcement agencies
believe that the contents of a person's
Facebook, Google, Dropbox or other
online account are important to an
investigation, let them get a warrant.
That way law enforcement can still
gain access if necessary, and users of
these services can rest easy knowing
that their privacy will not be intrud-
ed upon unless a judge decides that
such an intrusionis necessary.

'Wisbom' to delve
into human nature

"You ain't gettin' nun of this."

'U' Prof. OyamO's
play to tell story of
Vietnam protests
By TEHREEM SAJJAD
DailyArts Writer
It's 1968. The United States is
at war with Vietnam. As always,
there are those who oppose it.
They lead the

This week, 2p.m.
under the
direction of Arthar Miller
Associate Pro- Theatre
fessor Mbala Free
Nkanga, the
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance presents Ann Arbor audi-
ences with "Wisbom," a play
that captures the deeds of one of
these anti-war activist groups.
But, unlike most anti-war
groups, this particular collec-
tion of individuals went further
than most when attempting to
make a statement about what
they thought was right.

"It's one thing to hold pick-
et signs, but it's quite another
thing to drop bombs - or to
try to drop bombs - especially
when you're not ready, especial-
ly when you're all crazy," said
"Wisbom" playwright OyamO
Gordon, a professor of theater
and a writer-in-residence at the
University.
Set during the '60s on the
campus of Wisconsin Universi-
ty, "Wisbom" shines light on an
inexperienced anti-war group
that accentuated its disapprov-
al of the war by attempting to
bombard facilities the group
considered to be affiliated with
the war movement. Though the
group's actions conveyed their
strong criticism of the war, what
the members of the group did
also resulted in the killing of
an innocent man. In that sense,
"Wisbom" is a play that aims to
find justification for the actions
of one particular group, of peo-
ple, and in doing so, it questions
humanity.
"Human beings are the
strangest animals on earth -
the strangest because we think
we are the smartest, but no other
animal pollutes like we do,"
OyamO explained. "No other
animal has created nuclear
weapons and dropped them on
each other; o other animals fight

for religious reasons or political
reasons - no other animal - just
us.
"You should think about what
you're doing and that whatever
it is you are going to do ends
up being responsible," OyamO
continued. "You need to place
things carefully because if you
don't, you end up with a tragedy
- like the death of an innocent
man."
OyamO's plays have appeared
on stage across the country as
well as internationally. Some
of his works include "Famous
Orpheus," "Boundless Grace,"
"The Resurrection of Lady Les-
ter" and "Sorcerer's Apprentice."
He was commissioned by the
Madison Repertory Company
to produce "Wisbom" in 2003,
and it premiered at the Madison
Repertory's Fall Festival of the
Future in September 2004.
For OyamO, "Wisbom" serves
to entertain a wide range of audi-
ences: Those who find the '60s
enlightening, younger individu-
als who like to see action-filled
plays and those who are looking to
experience the America that was
sunk in war a few decades back.
"What is a human being? I
think it's a question that we
have to keep asking ourselves,"
OyamO said. "What are we and
what are we doing here?"

abandonment,
nymphomania FX
and vehicu-
lar manslaughter, among oth-
ers, relentlessly bombarding the
viewer with wave after wave of
discomfort.
The brilliant and demented
writers behind this season's hor-
rorfest have managed to deify an
alcoholic and sadistic nun, put the
devil in the skin of the initially
most naive and pathetic character
and convince viewers that a mur-
derer of nearly 50 years was a kind
and magnanimous therapist with
the best of intentions. The mid-
season premiere, titled "The Ori-
ginsof Monstrosity," playsheavily
with the pasts and justifications
of the series' biggest and baddest
characters.
Head Bitch in Charge Sister
Jude's (Jessica Lange) fall from
grace has been heavily foreshad-
owed, from her distinctly un-
sister-like penchant for slinky
lingerie, to a weakness for cognac.

With a past only illuminated via
the occasional flashback or whis-
per under her breath, Sister Jude
has gone from a cruel crone prone
to caning, to a vulnerable and
unappreciated devotee with an
idea she won't see come tp frui-
tion.
The nature of the relationship
between the enigmatic Mon-
signor (Joseph Fiennes) - the
object of Jude's affection - and
the terrifying Dr. Arthur Arden/
Hans Graper (James Crom-
well) becomes less opaque after
nymphomaniac Shelley's (Chloe
Sevigny) hospitalization. Upon
putting Shelley (who has com-
pleted her transformation from
insatiable Skrillex look-a-like to
legless, irradiated, tuberculosis-
and-syphilis-infected sac of pus)
out of her misery, the Monsignor
confronts Arden about his work
in a well-shot sequence that high-
lights the horrifying extent of the
doctor's destructive influence.
Dr. Oliver-Thredson (Zach-
ary Quinto) evolves from a low-
grade, deceptive bastard into
the incarnation of journalist
Lana Winters's (Sarah Paulson)
fears, toying with her desire to
be reunited with her deceased
lover. In a seriesof gut-wrench-
ingly awkward scenes, Thredson
describes his profound mommy
issuesin depthheaping ahelping
of heebie-jeebies to the already
bleak and stomach-turning sea-
son. His and Lana's midseason
arc ends with the bone-chilling
line, "Baby needs colostrum,"
eliciting more goosebumps and
dry heaves than the entire first
season.
But a chilling new charac-

ter makes an appearance: Jenny
(Nikki Hahn), an unfeeling little
girl who, apparently added for
pure shock value, ends up kill-
ing her entire family and lying
through her teeth about it after-
ward. As one of the weaker addi-
tions to the cast so far, the innately
evil child provides a tangible con-
trast to the deranged adults in the
series, but little else so far.
The devil is in
the details.
Unsurprisingly, the midseason
manages to create as many ques-
tions as it answers. Sister Mary
Eunice (Lily Rabe) has become
less and less subtle about her
being the physical incarnation of
Satan, casually informing Jenny
of this fact before killing Jude's
Nazi-hunting informant. Arden,
grateful for Mary Eunice's inef-
fable devotion, swears his soul
to her in exchange for protec-
tion. Signing over your soul to the
Devil apparently isn't as big a deal
when you're a crazed surgeon and
war criminal operating under a
fake name.
Going forward, the teaser at
the end of the midseason intro-
duces an angelic figure and what
appears to be Mary Eunice/Satan
flinging Arden across his lab. Just
in case aliens, freaks of nature
and psychopaths weren't enough,
the future promises more of the
supernatural for the residents of
Briarcliff and the show's devoted
viewership.

UMMA exhibitbuilt
on shaky- foundation

By MAX RADWIN
DailyArts Writer
Taped to t'he fa wall of my
room, forming a sort of dishev-
eled collage, are postcards from
art museums I've visited over
the years. Every time I go to a
museum for the first time, I stop
in the gift shop on my way out
and buy a postcard of my favor-
ite work. The only rule is that I
must have seen it in the gallery
on that day.
But spending hours in a muse-
um isn't everyone's thing; I get
that. And I don't think it has to
be. Life is confusing, and we all
have our own artistic outlets to
help us escape and keep sane. It
could come in the form of writ-
ing, music, comics, whatever.
For me, it happens to involve
taping postcards to the wall,
even if I haven't been looking at
them all too much lately - the
fact that they're there is all that
matters anyway.
So of course I was excited
when, in September, the Univer-
sity of Michigan Museum of Art
opened a Benjamin West exhibit
running thrdugh Jan. 13. But
was anyone else? The pieces on
show and the people coming to
view them really got me think-
ing about what role that massive
half Beaux-Arts, half minimal-
ist Frankenstein of a building
known as UMMA is actually
playing for the student body.
There's a lot of good in the
exhibit, but it certainly has its
weaknesses. Benjamin West is
arguably one of America's best
artists. He was one of the first

Americans to study in Italy, and a revolutionary one at that -

Opponents demand
Morsi rescind
decrees
CAIRO (AP) - The same
chants used against Hosni
Mubarak were turned againsthis
successor Tuesday as more than
200,000 people packed Egypt's
Tahrir Square in the biggest
challenge yet to Islamist Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi.
The massive, flag-waving
throng protesting Mhrsi's asser-
tion of near-absolute powers
rivaled some ofthe largest crowds
that helped drive Mubarak from
office last year.
"The people want to bring
down the regime!" and "erhal,
erhal" - Arabic for "leave, leave"
- rang out across the plaza, this
time directed at Egypt's first
freely elected president.
The protests were sparked
by edicts Morsi issued last week
that effectively neutralize the
judiciary, the last branch of gov-
ernment he does not control. But
they turned into a broader out-
pouring of anger against Morsi'
and his Muslim Brotherhood,
which opponents say have used
election victories to monopolize
power, squeeze out rivals and
dictate a new, Islamist constitu-
tion, while doing little to solve

Egypt's mounting economic and
security woes.
Clashes broke out in several
cities, with Morsi's opponents
attacking Brotherhood offices,
settingfire to atleast one. Protest-
ers and Brotherhood members
pelted each other with stones and
firebombs in the Nile Delta cityof
Mahalla el-Kobra, leaving at least
100 people injured.
"Power has exposed the
Brotherhood. We discovered
their true face," said Laila Salah,
ahousewife at the Tahrir protest
who said she voted for Morsi in
last summer's presidential elec-
tion. After Mubarak, she said,
Egyptians would no longer
accept being ruled by an auto-
crat.
"It's like a wife whose hus-
band was beating her and then she
divorces him and becomes free,"
she said. "If she remarries she'll
neveraccept anotherdayof abuse."
Gehad el-Haddad, a senior
adviser to the Brotherhood and
its political party, said Morsi
would not back down on his
edicts. "We are not rescinding
the declaration," he told The
Associated Press.
That sets the stage for a
drawn-out battle that could
throw the nation into greater
turmoil. Protestorganizers have
called for another mass rally Fri-
day. If the Brotherhood responds

with demonstrations of its own,
as some of its leaders have hint-
ed, it would raise the prospect of
greater violence after a series of
clashes between the two camps
in recent days.
A tweet by the Brotherhood
warned that if the opposition
was able to bring out 200,000 to
300,000, "they should brace for
millions in support" of Morsi.
Another flashpoint could come
Sunday, when the constitutional
court is to rule on whether to dis-
solve the assembly writing the
new constitution, which is domi-
nated by the Brotherhood and
its Islamist allies. Morsi's edicts
ban the courts from disbanding
the panel; if the court defies him
and rules anyway, it would be a
direct challenge that could spill
over into the streets.
"Then we are in the face
of the challenge between the
supreme court and the presi-
dency," said Nasser Amin, head
of the Arab Center for the Inde-
pendence of the Judiciary and
the Legal Profession. "We are
about to enter a serious con-
flict" on both the legal and
street level, he said.
Morsi and his supporters
say the decrees were neces-
sary to prevent the judiciary
from blocking the "revolution's
goals" of a transition to democ-
racy.

the coach plans to talk to Lewan
about a potential jump to the NFL

he doesn't try to steer players to

"At St. John's, we had a team
that handled pressure extremely
well and we played Duke and did
not handle pressure extremely
well," Barnes Arico said. "So I
know going in that will be a sig-
nificant challenge for us."
The Blue Devils return four
starters from a 27-6 team that
advanced to the Elite Eight last
season, including pre-season All-

Chelsea Gray and sophomore
Elizabeth Williams - who also
tied with Maryland's Alyssa

As a team, Duke entered the
season ranked third. It also
received nine of 12 first-place Pre-
season Coaches' ACC Poll votes
to enter the season as tops in the
conference.
In their first four games, the
Blue Devils have been completely
dominant. They are almost dou-
bling their opponents' average
point total at an 89 to 45 rate. To
go along with that, they are shoot-
ing 51.6 percent from the field,
while their opponents are being
held to a 29.2 percentage.
Duke will surely have an
advantage over the Wolverines in
rebounding. Michigan (5-1) has
outrebounded its opposition in its
first six games 206 to 198, though
that's a small margin. In a stark

comparison, the Blue Devils have
outrebounded their opponents
by a total of 68 and are averaging
46.2 boards a game compared to
30 for their opponents. 'M' has
only averaged 34.3 per game.
"Their'post play is exception-
al," Barnes Arico said. "Elizabeth
Williams is one of the best in the
country. We are going to have
a tough time matching up with
their size, their strength and their
athleticism."
With senior Rachel Sheffer
as the only true forward in the
starting lineup, sophomore guard
Nicole Elmblad will be key to

Daily SportsEditor
A few things about freshman
guard Nik Stauskas: Though
Canadian, he doesn't watch
hockey. He doesn't know who
Alanis Morrisette is but he's a big
Justin Bieber fan. He particularly
likes the Canadian popstar's new
stuff, and appreciated his biopic,
"Never Say Never."
Oh, and Stauskas has also
emerged as the Michigan basket-
ball team's new dynamic offen-
sive threat. The 6-foot-6 Ontario
native scored a career-high and
game-high 20 points on just 10
shots, fueling Michigan in its
79-72 win over North Carolina
State on Tuesday.
Flashing his inveterate shoot-
ing ability while also punish-
ing Wolfpack defenders off the
dribble, Stauskas makes it hard
for Michigan coach John Beilein
to keep him out of the starting
lineup.
"He's a pure shooter," said
sophomore point guard Trey
Burke.
"And when you have a guy like
that that can shoot and put the
ball on the ground and get to the
paint and create for others, it's a
big plus because he can open the
defense up."
Senior guard Matt Vogrich
started, but was yanked by
Beilein after two fouls, which
came on the heels of an errant
pass that led to the game's first
points.
Insert Stauskas.
On his first possession, Staus-
kas took the pass, took his
defender off the dribble into the
paint and curled out to the block,
scooping the ball in with his left
hand.
Then came the 3-point bar-
rage. He made three straight
from range, including one as he
was falling down and nearly 25
feet away from the basket.
It doesn't come as a surprise
to Burke, though. Stauskas has

Freshman guard Nik Stauskas scored a career-high 20 points.

been doing that since he arrived
in Ann Arbor this summer.
"That's probably the best
shooter I've played with," Burke
said. "He shoots like a pro. Just
gotta be honest."
Stauskas finished the game
6-for-10 from the field and
made four of his seven 3-point
attempts. He's shooting 60 per-
cent from the field on the season
and has a nearly identical 3-point
make rate. Despite coming off
the bench, he's scored in double
figures. the last five games and
finds himself third onthe teamin
scoring.
"Shooting is what I do," Staus-
kas said. "I'm comfortable with
it. I've probably taken a million
shots in my life. That's pretty
much all I did when I was a kid,
just go outside and shoot."
But when he just went outside
to shoot, he wasn't being closely.
defended. Stauskas's three miss-
es from 3-point range all came
on uncontested shots. It was the
tough ones, with a hand in his
face, which he was burying.
"I think I shoot better when
I have people running at me,"
Stauskas said. "I don't think
about it as much when people
are running at me. I just shoot it
quicker.".

It may prove difficult, then, to
make sense of Stauskas's free-
throw shooting. No defenders
running at him there.
Stauskas made all four of his
attempts from the line, mak-
ing him 20-for-21 on the sea-
son - a 95-percent clip. That
may prove especially decisive in
close games later in the season.
With strong free-throw shooters
needed to close out opponents
who foul late in a tight contest,
Stauskas could become the Wol-
verines' biggest weapon.
"I wouldn't say he replaced
Zack (Novak) on defense,
because we don't have a replace-
ment for that," Burke said. "But
he replaced Zack in free-throw
shooting because he's just as
good if not better than Zack at
shooting free throws."
The only thing left to figure
out is why Stauskas isn't start
ing yet. According to Beilein,
it could have something to do
with the'superstition of keeping
things the same on an unbeaten
team - but change may be on the
horizon.
"I want to see Matt have
some success in there, but Nick's
adapted so well in it," Beilein
said. "It is something youhave to
consider down the line."

Welcome to the Random
Student Interview, where we
didn't have time to draw you any
fucking pictures this week.
So I've got a confession to make.
This interview isn't really "ran-
dom."
(Laughs)
It's true. Actually, I usually wait
outside of the Union, and try to
find someone who looks friendly
enough to talk to me, but it's way
too fucking cold for that.
Yeah.
So today I wandered the Union
and found you sitting here
looking friendly. It's totally
profiling.
Legit.
So I see your doing some sort of
biology work there. What do you
'want to go into?
I'm pre-dental. I actually find out
on Monday if I got in here.
Cool. I hope you do, but it might
be productive to talk about back-
up plans. Let's start brainstorm-
ing.
For you?
For both of us.
Alright.
So, what are you going to do if
you don't get into dental school?
I would probably get a research
position for a year until I could
reapply so at least it would look
like I was doing something in the
field.
It's the illusion of doing some-
thing?
Right. Right.
But that's boring. These back-

Are you susceptible to ads?
Yes, I love them!
33.3%
Yes, but I hate that I am
66.7%
Online comments
Some of the commercials are ok, but most just aggravate me. It's espe-
cially nice when I KNOW the commercials are going to be well-funded, well
thought-out ones at that, like during the Super Bowl and Olympics. I just
got the Hopper from DISH however, and you haven't LIVED until you've
watched TV without commercials
-matt, regarding "Why I love ads"

up plans are fake because we're
both obviously going to be wildly
successful individuals so we can
get creative.
OK then. I'd go develop an alter-
nate personality in Las Vegas.
Wow, you're really going for it
now.-
I'd become a card counter and win
millions of dollars and retire early.
I feel like with a job like that,
you'd need a nickname. What
would your nickname be?
I would go for ... The Electric
Pussycat.
That's so great. I think you
should use that in dental school
as well. You could be Dr. Electric
Pussycat. Not that you need to
go to dental school anymore.
You know, I think I could buy
enough teeth whitening treat-
ments to be happy for life with the
kind of money I'll be making, so
you know what? I don't need to go.
I think I could just start a ring of
blackjack card counters.
Would you have room for me?
Yeah.
But I'm not very good at math. I
can't count cards.
You could be our accountant.
Yeah, accountants don't use
numbers. I could be the journal-
ist who throws the police off
your tail by printing misinfor-
mation about your operations.
I'd pretend to be scoping you
guys out, but really I'd be on
your side, protecting you from
the media and the law.
Sounds perfect.
I'd print an article that you
moved to Atlantic City, but really

you'd still be in Vegas, living
under another alias.
That's a great idea.
Smoke and mirrors. Damn,
that got out there. So ... let's
talk about Christmas. Oh wait,
should Ihave said "the holidays"
or whatever? How do you feel
about people saying "Happy
Holidays?"
As opposed to "Merry Christmas?"
Yeah.
Like I'm Jewish and I don't care.
It's kind of like the same senti-
ment if someone says, "I'm pray-
ing for you." I don't believe in that,
but if it's something that means
something to you then it's a nice
gesture.
That's nice. I wish everybody
had that idea. So anyway, on to
more important stuff: presents.
Yeah. What about them?
I kind of feel like this might be
my last year to get some good
stuff.
Yeah, well what I started doing
was going to the mall and taking
pictures of things I want and send-
ing them to my parents.
Subtle. Real subtle.
Yeah. So I have a photo journal of
my wish list this year.
See I was thinking about just
posting things on Facebook like
"Man, I could really use some
money or an iPod."
Yeah. You should. Do it. Or just be
less subtle like me and text it.
With a name like The Electric
Pussycat, I wouldn't expect any-
thing less.

nside a large white box there is an oper-
ant chamber, housing a rat with black
and white hair.
As the rat scurries, it looks this way and
that, a tourist observing foreign surround-
ings, oblivious to the adjacent monitor track-
ing electrical signals that emanate from the
tips of wires inserted into its brain.
The monitor, known as a bank of amplifi-
ers, enhances the sound of distinct neurons,
each of which makes a crackling sound as it
appears on screen.
Researchers listen to these neurons to
test algorithms in the rat's brain circuitry
that are used, according to Joshua Berke,
an associate professor of psychology and
neuroscience, in the service of "decid-
ing." Results aid in the understanding of
the core neural circuitry that underlies
human diseases and disorders such as
Parkinson's disease, Obsessive-compul-
sive Disorder, Tourette syndrome and
drug addiction.
These experiments are common for the
Berke Lab. And at the University, which as
of September spends $1.24 billion annu-
ally on research, professors and students
alike devote countless hours to laborato-
ries scattered across campus, from East
Hall to the Biomedical Science Research
Building.
Initial shock
Yet, when many labs require live animal
subjects, which can range from mice to dogs
to rabbits, what is the adjustment process
like for a student unaccustomed to working
with animals, some of whom are killed by the
end of an experiment?
According to Berke, those who choose to
work with animals are self-selecting.
"I think everyone findsthat they enjoy and
are comfortable with some kinds of experi-
ments and that you don't want to do other
kinds of experiments," Berke said. "People
find their natural niche."
Moreover, students are given full warn-
ing about what they're getting into during
the interview process, Berke said. He added
that if a studentwas uncomfortable or unable
to deal with animals, there are always other
positions available in the lab.
But no matter how mentally prepared you
are, the first time you watch an animal die
can be shocking.
"You just kind of have to deal with it," said
University alum Steven Kiss, who induced
heart attacks in dogs and rabbits while work-
ing in a cardiovascular pharmacology lab
that tested new drugs for people with heart
conditions. "Definitely the first few times
were really surprising."
In 2010, statistics from the United States

Department of Agriculture showed that
about 1.1 million animals were used in labora-
tory settings, excluding animals such as rats,
mice, birds and fisl that are not covered by
the Animal Welfare Act, though these same
statistics estimated that 25 million of such
animals are used annually, comprising 95
percent of all animals used in U.S. research.
Kiss's lab observed dogs and rabbits that
had been given an oral medication. Some
animals were given the drug for a seven-day
period, while others for a 14-day period. The
goal, Kiss said, is to determine how well a
drug protects the animal from a heart attack,
similar to how a person taking heart medi-

said.
Before students ever handle animals
they are required to take a series of courses
through the Unit for - Laboratory Animal
Medicine to meet standards set by the Uni-
versity Committee on Use and Care of Ani-
mals and the Department of Occupational
Safety & Environmental Health.
While all students go through ULAM
before beginning lab work, each lab has its
own set of protocols it submits to ULAM for
approval. As a result, ULAM can tailor its
instructions to ensure that each student's
training is animal-specific to his or her lab.
For Kiss, this meant being trained with

she has taken at the University.
"It's always frightening coming from no
experience and then having someone watch '
what you do," Buttigieg said. "But I think it's
the best way to learn."
Being ethical
The University's Office of the Vice Presi-
dent for Research states on its website that
the University is "committed to the humane
and ethical treatment of all animals used in
research and training."
Yet there are naysayers, notably the Peo-
ple for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
which deems animal research unnecessary.
On its website, PETA cites an article
from The Journal of the American Medi-
cal Association: "Patients and physicians
should remain cautious about extrapolating
the finding of prominent animal research to
the care of human disease ... poor replication
of even high-quality animal studies should
be expected by those who conduct clinical
research."
Berke said this is not the case.
"The reason why we're funded by the fed-
eral government is because we're trying to
understand how we can intervene to allevi-
ate horrible diseases," he said.
Furthermore, as Berke views it, animal
treatment has only improved over the years
since he started in research.
"It's now increasingly standard to give
even rats and mice enriched environments
with toys to play with," he said. "Ten, 15 years
ago, only monkeys might have gotten that."
Kiss agreed.
"(The animals) have 24-hour access to
a vet," he said. "I would say three (to) five
times a day someone's checking in on them.
So they're living pretty well."
For Rackham student Daniel Castro, who
studies biopsychology in the Kent Berridge
Lab and looks at mice and rats to understand
aberrant motivational systems in the brain,
ethical treatment is a form of giving back.
"We want to make sure that the animals
experience the least amount of suffering
possible," Castro said. "We're using these
animals to do research to help people and
even to help animals. So we want them
to have the best experience we can give
them."
Despite better conditions, many animal
subjects have limited life spans. For new-
comers to lab work, the transition process
continues, each student overcoming his or
her personal obstacles one test at a time.
"It takes a while to get used to," said LSA
senior Lily Zhang, who studies mice to learn
how synapses in the brain are formed. "Actu-
ally getting in and getting your hands in on
it, it's another experience."

cine might react.
He explained the initial difficulty of see-
ing an animal being put to death.
"Some of the dogs are so nice," he said.
"You'd be with them for two weeks and you'd
have to walk them and play with them, and
then on that fourteenth day it's like, damn.".
Yet Kiss emphasized he never dwelt on
this aspect.
"You've got to understand that you're
doing it for a good cause," he said. "It feels
worth it."
Animal training
LSA senior Emily Buttigieg's hands were
shaking the first time she dissected a mouse
during her freshmanyear at the University.
Her work in the Kalantry Lab examines
chromosome X-inactivation in mice embry-
os. Having learned from science textbooks
all through high school, this skill was dif-
ferent; it was hands-on and could only be
learned through trial and error, Buttigieg

canines and New Zealand white rabbits prior
to starting lab work.
"They go over how to handle the animal,
ways to hold it ... who to call if there's a prob-
lem," Kiss said. "They just go over every sin-
gle situation you would need."
For example, Buttigieg employs a tech-.
nique known as cervical dislocation to
remove mice embryos from the mother.
"We can't use the (traditional) gas because
that harms the embryos. So we use cervical
dislocation, which is a little difficult to learn
at first," she said.
She noted, however, that she was fortunate
tobe trained directly by Sundeep Kalantry, the
lab's principal investigator. This close atten-
tion made Buttigieg feel more comfortable
with the experiments when first starting out,
especially since she could have been trained
by an overworked graduate student with little
spare time to dedicate to undergraduates.
She said Kalantry's careful guidance was
key to her success in the lab, which she says
has taught her more than any science class

so much body function that he couldn't control his
motorized wheelchair with his hands; he had to
control it with his head movements instead. When
I walked into the room, he was lying down and
receiving his treatment. But as we spoke about the
progression of his disease, he was incredibly posi-
tive and kind. He had two people with him at his
*appointment.
This made me wonder: Which came first, the
good attitude or the support? Did those who had
friends and family supporting them have people
helping them because of their good attitude? Or
did they have a good attitude because people loved
them enough to help?
Either way, seeing some of the MS patients who
dealt with their disease on their own made me

really sad. It made me remember how important
it is to be there for my dad. Whether he needs help
or doesn't, it can't hurt to let him know that I'm
here if he wants it.
There is nothing fun about struggle or sickness.
Even though my dad has an incredibly debilitating
disease with no hope of recovery at the moment,
our family survives because of our love for each
other - and a good sense of humor. When my dad
repeats himself for the'third time in one meal, we
laugh about it, make jokes and give him big hugs.
When we are at social events and his fatigue is
causing him to talk so much that it's annoying oth-
ers, we give him a special look. He responds with
a zip of his lips and a smile. Our communication
and loving attitude toward the disease make it all
work.

Maintaining stability
PERSONAL STATEMENT by Alden Reiss


When I was 10, my dad would chauf-
feur me to school once a week. I
would sit on his lap as we drove
the 10 city blocks to my middle school.
Unlike most people who were driven to
school, my journey took place on the sidewalk
instead of the street - in my dad's motorized
wheelchair, since he was unable to walk at the
time.
I first realized there was something wrong
the summer before 5th grade during Par-
ents' Day at my Jewish summer camp in
New Hampshire. My dad, who had always
been tan, physically strong and full of ener-
gy, showed up with a cane, looking pale and
exhausted. When I asked for a ride on his
shoulders, he wasn't strong enough to carry
me.,
When I returned from camp a month later,
my parents broke the news to my sister and
me. My dad had multiple sclerosis, a disease.
that would affect his brain and spinal cord,
making him tired and unable to walk. I was
assured that he would not die from it and,
more importantly, that we would be OK. My
four-year-old cousin,overhearingthe diagno-
sis, came in afterward and asked why my dad
was "a mess," having not clearly heard about
MS.
As a tough tomboy at the time, I kept my
emotions inside, ignoring any opportunity
my mom gave to me to talk about my feel--
ings. Due to the stress that came with his
diagnosis, my dad had developed depression
and anxiety. I remember opening a pack-
age from Amazon that had arrived at my
PHOTOS BY ALDEN REISS

front door and seeing a book on dealing with
depression. I sealed the package back up and
put my emotions away with it, deciding to
not confront the situation or talk to my fam-
ily about it.
As I got older and closer with my family, I
became-more comfortable talking about my'
feelings and discomfort with the disease.
My dad's MS has its ups and downs, as the
disease typically does - it depends on the day.
Sometimes he can walk decently without any
apparatuses.
Sometimes he uses a cane. Sometimes
he uses a vehicle. And sometimes he can't
even leave our apartment because of the
fatigue. Though my sister and I were never
explicitly asked to step up and help my dad,
we would do little things. Beginning at the
age of 10, every time we approached a set of
stairs, I ran up to my dad, holding his side
that.wasn't being supported by the banister.
And whenever we would travel through air-
ports, go to restaurants, or really anywhere,
that wasn't on a couch, I felt protective of
my dad.
The scariest moments have been when
he repeats himself. For example, he'll forget
a story I have told him or is so tired that he
doesn't have enough energy to recall certain
thoughts or ideas in conversation. When I
was younger, I would get angry during these
moments, but as I got older I realized that my
anger only made the situation scarier for both
of us. There is absolutely nothing good about
feeling like you have lost your marbles, espe-
cially when you don't have control of your

brain and its contents.At51, he is fairly young,
but sometimes he has to- deal with physi-
cal and mental problems that should only be
issues for someone who is 20 years older than
he is.
My dad had one of his best years when I
was a freshman in college. He was able to
walk and do a fair amount of exercise on his
recumbent bike in Central Park. During my
second semester, we both trained to do the
42-mile New York City Bike Race to raise
money for a charity called First Descents. Not
only did we finish the race, but we also did it
in great time.
Since then, he has physically and cogni-
tively gone downhill. At the moment, he uses
a cane outside of the house, and if he is trav-
eling more than a few blocks, he has to use
the vehicle. He cannot exercise, and by 3p.m.
he feels so tired that we know to not expect
much of him cognitively.
One night, I apologized to my mom. I said
I was sorry that she had a husband who was
in so much pain, and who was unable to walk
and sometimes unable to think straight. I just
wanted him to be OK, I told her. My mom
said, "He isn't going to be OK. He isn't going
to get better anymore. But there is nothing
to be sorry for. I am still the luckiest woman
alive to be married to him and to have our
family."
This past summer, I decided to learn more
about the disease. I knew that there was a
wide range of manifestations the disease
could take on, and I wanted to see them
firsthand. After being awarded a grant from

the Stamps School of Art & Design, I worked
with the Multiple Sclerosis Research Center
of New York photographing the struggles
of several MS patients. Dr. Saud A. Sadiq,
director of MSRCNY and my father's doc-
tor, graciously introduced me to nine of his
patients, and I had the opportunity to docu-
ment many of the physical and emotional
pains that MS patients face on a daily basis,
both in the doctor's office and in their own
homes.
It was really nice getting to know my dad's
doctor. Rather than looking at his patients
as markings on a chart, Sadiq gets a sense of
each patient as a whole person, chatting with
them about their significant others, family,
friends and hobbies. For Sadiq, understand-
ing a person's lifestyle is key to understand-
ing how to treat their MS. Because of these
almost-therapeutic office visits, his patients
have come to love him. Not just like him -
they love him. I know this because each one
of them told me. I had never heard anyone
talk about their doctor the way these patients
spoke about Sadiq.
Through this project, I found out that
every person, and the manifestation of their
version of the disease, was completely differ-
ent. The medication, treatment, symptoms
and stage of MS vary so much that it seemed
to me each patient I photographed had a dif-
ferent disease.
But I found that those who had family or
friends helping them dealt with the disease
much better. There was one man who had lost
