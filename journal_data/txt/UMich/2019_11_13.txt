ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In the weeks leading up 
to the Ohio State University 
football game, University of 
Michigan staff and students are 
participating in the 38th annual 
campus-wide “Blood Battle” 
blood drive to out-donate OSU. 
Though the University suffered 
a defeat against the Buckeyes 

on the field last year, Michigan 
students secured their seventh 
Blood Battle win in 11 years. 
With just over two weeks until 
the game, University students 
aim to repeat that victory.
Nursing senior Alex Zeto, 
executive board member of 
Blood Drives United, explained 
that to her and many others, 
the competition is only one 
part of the Battle’s purpose. 

She said she enjoys how the 
Battle’s rivalry-driven success 
is supplemented by the fact 
each pint of blood is used to 
help a person in need.
Zeto 
first 
attempted 
to 
donate blood in high school, 
but she was turned away 
due to Red Cross’s eligibility 
requirements. 
But 
she 
got 
to campus and saw a drive 
at her dorm freshman year 

and decided to try again. She 
joined Blood Drives United 
the following year and has 
helped the organization plan 
the Blood Battle annually since 
then.
“Since high school, I just 
thought it seemed like a really 
easy way to give back with 
people who need my blood 
more than I do,” Zeto said.
The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Veteran 

and 
Military 
Services 
organized the “Diversity 
in the Military” panel on 
Monday to discuss equity 
and 
inclusion 
in 
the 
United States Military. 
The 
panel 
was 
moderated 
by 
Philip 
Larson, program director 
of Veteran and Military 
Services. The audience 
consisted 
of 
about 
15 
students and veterans.
Larson 
began 
the 
panel’s 
conversation 
by asking the panelists 
about 
their 
decisions 
to 
join 
the 
military. 
Rackham student Jacob 
Granzow 
ref lected 
on 
how 9/11 impacted him 
and encouraged him to 
join the military.
“I was 13 when 9/11 
happened, and I guess 
those images that were 
on the news just stuck 
with me,” said Granzow. 
“I 
joined 
because 
it 
just affected me, and I 
wanted to help in any 
way I could.”

A panel of LGBTQ military 
veterans discussed the political 
and social issues faced by past and 
present veterans who identify as 
LGBTQ in the Michigan League 
Tuesday. 
Three veterans of various 
military ranks and branches 
were present, including Captain 
Michelle Yi, a Business graduate 
student, Staff Sergeant Lacy 
Jones, 
Dentistry 
junior, 
and 
Specialist Necko Fanning, an LSA 
senior who moderated the panel.
Fanning asked the panelists 
what can be done to make society 
more welcoming to members of 
the LGBTQ community.
Jones said she came from the 
deep South and was a Southern 
Baptist Christian. She explained 
the community was not very 
accepting of LGBTQ people. 
“I would like to see a safe 
space for individuals that may 
be struggling with any form of 
spirituality and accepting their 
identity, which can be a really 
challenging thing in and of itself,” 
Jones said. “Finding a Christian 
organization that is accepting 
of the LGBTQ+ community and 
doesn’t consider gay people to be 
an abomination can be a battle.”

The 
University 
of 
Michigan Central Student 
Government met Tuesday 
to discuss the University 
budget, Giving Blueday 2019 
and to debate the recall of 
two members of the Student 
Organization 
Funding 
Committee for misconduct 
during 
their 
membership 
application 
process. 
One 
member has been removed 
and 
the 
second 
will 
be 
debated next week.
Vice Provost for Academic 
and Budgetary Affairs Amy 
Dittmar presented on the 
University budget, including 
composition, allocation and 
budgetary models. Dittmar’s 
presentation 
included 
several 
comparisons 
between how the University 
collects and disperses funds 
versus 
other 
public 
and 
private universities. 

Topics Dittmar discussed 
included 
appropriations 
and 
how 
University’s 
affordability 
compares 
to 
other 
public 
universities. 
According to Dittmar, recent 
tuition increases have helped 
achieve 
affordability 
for 
many students on campus.
“We also have increasing 
costs because we invest in 
it being more affordable,” 
Dittmar said. “So, now this 
is a little counterintuitive, 
because 
we’re 
increasing 
tuition to pay for the cost, 
and then we have to make it 
more affordable. So, what it 
comes down to is that there’s 
a difference in what the 
sticker price is and what in 
any individual student might 
pay, and that’s purposeful. 
That’s purposeful for us 
to be able to help with the 
affordability.”

Sharon 
Waxman, 
president and CEO of the 
Fair 
Labor 
Association, 
gave a presentation Tuesday 
night on the importance of 
transparency and enforcing 
human 
rights 
mandates 
in 
big 
corporations. 
The 
discussion took place in the 
Ross School of Business and 
drew in a crowd of about 40 

community members.
Ravi Anupindi, chair of 
the 
President’s 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Labor 
Standards and Human Rights 
at the University, began by 
explaining the University’s 
role in supporting fair labor 
practices. 
“Anything that you buy 
that has a Michigan logo, as 
a University we care about 
the 
labor 
standards 
and 
human rights and the supply 
chains that produce these 

products,” 
Anupindi 
said. 
“There 
is 
an 
operational 
mandate 
to 
ensure 
that 
companies that we license 
our logo to actually meet the 
labor standards of human 
rights.”
Waxman 
began 
her 
presentation by discussing a 
past trend in large industries 
to 
prioritize 
profit 
over 
the well-being of workers. 
However, 
she 
said 
that 
rhetoric has begun to change 
in recent years. 

“For decades, the premise 
that companies exist for the 
benefit of shareholders has 
driven a lot of CEOs and 
boards of directors to make 
decisions based primarily on 
profitability,” Waxman said. 
“Although not entirely new, 
the concept that companies 
have a role to play in society, 
for the good of society, has 
emerged as a focal point in 
recent years.”

When 
LSA 
junior 
Fareah 
Fysudeen heard the University 
of Michigan would be hosting 
one of the presidential debates 
in the fall of 2020, she said she 
assumed it was for publicity. 
Upon thinking about it further, 
she felt like the University was 
not considering the potential 
impacts of this decision on 
marginalized communities. 
“It’s 
a 
way 
to 
establish 
ourselves as a good school and 
as the kind of school that would 
host such a presidential debate,” 
Fyusdeen said. “So, immediately 
I thought, oh, this is a self-
aggrandizing thing. It’s a way to 
get out there … my immediate 
second thought was, after I 
talked about it with other people 
who expressed concern, oh, that 
makes sense. This University is 

doing this for a namesake, and it 
is clear to me that they would not 
always consider the implications 
this would have on marginalized 
communities on campus.”
Since the announcement the 
University will be hosting the 
event, the University has held 
multiple town hall events to 
discuss student involvement and 
safety during the debate. 
In an interview with The Daily 
earlier this month, University 
President Mark Schlissel said the 
University would be extremely 
well-prepared in terms of safety 
for the community. 
“It’s not just our DPSS, but 
it’s state police, all the national 
security apparatus will be here,” 
Schlissel said. “It’ll probably 
be the safest place in America, 
physically.”
Schlissel also discussed how 
the debate might negatively 
impact students mentally due 

to the intensity of the current 
political climate. 
“I recognize that it’s going 
to be a stressful year because 
the body of politics is very 
polarized, and there’s a lot of fear 
mongering as part of the debate, 
and we’re all subject to that,” 
Schlissel said. “I think that it 
may be of more intensity because 
everyone is here in town, but 
I think it’s going to be pretty 
intense no matter what. We have 
CAPS.”
Christine Asidao, associate 
director 
of 
community 
engagement and outreach at 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services, 
said 
she 
is 
most 
concerned 
about 
potentially 
hateful incidents coming from 
people from outside of Ann 
Arbor visiting for the debate, 
making students generally feel 
more unsafe on campus.
“It really is more what are some 
of the protections associated 
with the debate,” Asidao said. 
“You know, we’ve seen it in 
the past with the previous 
election, things that might 
occur, like possible hate and 
bias incidents. That sense of 
just, you know, feeling unsafe 
psychologically as well as 
physically for some of our 
students.”
Fysudeen said elections 
in general tend to change 
the campus climate at the 
University and that hosting 
the 
debate 
will 
further 
increase the tension in the 
community. 
“Presidential 
elections 
themselves have a profound 
effect on the climate on 
campus, and I think (the 
debate) just raises the stakes 
so much higher,” Fysudeen 
said. “It turns up the heat, 
especially if we’re going to 
be an epicenter of the eye 
of the entire nation. I feel 
like people feel the need to 
perform or to respond or to be 
reactive, and so it heightens 
the 
tension 
that 
already 

exists 
when 
these 
elections 
happen, especially following the 
2016 election.”
Fysudeen 
continued 
by 
discussing 
how 
marginalized 
communities often most strongly 
feel the effects of this tension 
and have to respond or defend 
themselves.
“It just raises the stakes in 
a way that can be very hostile 
sometimes, and marginalized 
communities are usually the 
ones that take the blunt of that 
tension,” Fysudeen said. “And 
so people of color, people who 
aren’t represented, people who 
constantly have to be at the 
forefront of these things are just 
going to be put in places where 
they have to be or represent 
themselves or, you know, their 
mere existence is going to have to 
be defended.”
Indeed, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Julianna 
Collado, 
external 
director of La Casa, told The 
Daily in an email interview that 
the 
atmosphere 
surrounding 
debate will be difficult to predict, 
but it’s important to prepare 
communities for anything that 
might happen. 
““Even though it is a great 
opportunity, we are sensitive to 
the needs of our community on 
campus,”” Collado said. ““The 
Latinx community has been a 
target of Trump’s administration, 
right alongside many of the 
communities also represented 
on Michigan’s campus. Due to 
his rhetoric and others, people 
feel emboldened to express their 
racist and xenophobic sentiments 
as well. In many ways, we do 
not know what to expect from 
the Presidential Debate being 
on campus. We do know that 
there will be an increase in 
media, security, and people in 
general in Ann Arbor, which is 
unpredictable in and of itself. 
For this reason, we are already 
planning ahead to identify ways 
to support members of the Latinx 
community on U-M’s campus.”

‘U’ minority student enrollment reaches all-time record

Nov. 11, 1994
Asian American enrollment at the 
University increased 1 percent this 
year, according to fall enrollment 
figures released Wednesday the 
largest increase for a minority 
group since the Michigan Mandate 
began in 1987. With this increased 
enrollment, and slight increases in 
Black, Hispanic and Native American 
enrollment, more minority students 
now attend the University than ever 
before.
“The continued growth in the 
number of students of color is 
gratifying, since their presence 
enriches this campus,” University 
President James J. Duderstadt said 
in a statement. “But we have noted 
a trend toward slower growth in 

the numbers of African American 
students. I have asked the executive 
officers to concentrate on ways to 
improve our attraction and retention 
of African American students in the 
coming year.”
Since 1987, the University has 
worked 
to 
increase 
minority 
enrollment through the Michigan 
Mandate.
Minority students now account 
for 24.2 percent of all students – up 
from 15.4 percent in 1988. Last year, 
minority enrollment accounted for 
21.4 percent of all students.
But 
progress 
in 
minority 
enrollment slowed this year. Since 
1988, 
minority 
enrollment 
has 
increased by at least 460 students. 
This year, minority enrollment 

increased by only 349 students.
University spokeswoman Lisa 
Baker attributed this to increased 
competition for minority students. 
“Michigan has had a very good 
track record. You get increased 
competition and
that plays a factor,” she said. 
Asian American students account 
for the largest increase in minority 
enrollment, now 3,421, or 10.4 
percent of the student body, up from 
3,126, or 9.4 percent, last year.
“My hope would have been we 
could have equaled that number 
for African American students,” 
said Lester Monts, vice provost for 
academic and multicultural affairs.
Edgar Ho, chairperson of the 
United Asian American Organiza- 

tions, attributed the increase to the 
kinds of people applying.
“I think it’s probably just a natural 
result of the increased number of 
Asian Americans applying,” he said. 
“On the face of it, there’s nothing 
necessarily good or bad about it.”
Other minority groups also had 
increases in enrollment, but not 
nearly as high.
African Americans now number 
2,715, or 8.3 percent of the total 
enrollment, compared with 2,706, or 
8.1 percent, last year.
Hispanic student enrollment rose 
to 1,533, or4.7 percent of all students, 
up from 1,497, or 4.5 percent, last year. 
Enrollment for Native American 
students grew to 258, or 0.8 percent, 
this year, up from 249, or 0.7 percent, 

last year.
“As a part of the Michigan 
Mandate, this is a priority and 
it’s something we’re quite serious 
about,” Baker said. “It has involved 
the tireless efforts of many, including 
the highest level of the University, 
faculty, staff, faculty, alumni.”
The 
University’s 
increase 
in 
minorities has been the slowest for 
Black Students.
In 1988, Black and Asian American 
enrollment accounted for the same 
level of the student population – 
6.2 percent. The next year, Asian 
American 
enrollment 
surpassed 
Black enrollment, making them the 
largest minority group on campus.
Today there are 706 more Asian 
Americans than Black students on 

Campus.
Monts said the University needs 
to place a greater emphasis on its 
recruiting efforts to improve Black 
enrollment.
“I believe it’s going to take 
a 
concerted 
effort 
across 
the 
campus....I’m not pleased with the 
progress we’re making,” he said.
The University also has been 
less successful in retaining Black 
students.
For the entering class of 1987, 
65.1 percent of all Black students 
graduated 
within 
six 
years, 
compared with 85.4 percent for the 
University as a whole. For Asian 
Americans entering the University in 
1987, 88.2 percent graduated within 
six years.

This shift has primarily 
been 
driven 
by 
younger 
generations, Waxman added. 
She said they are more 
conscious of human rights 
and make more mindful 
purchasing decisions. 
“While 
the 
fight 
to 
improve working conditions 
is far from a new one, it 
is 
clear 
today’s 
up-and-
coming generations are far 
more aware and mindful 
of social issues, including 
the treatment of workers,” 
Waxman said.
Waxman then explained 
one way the Fair Labor 
Association 
has 
been 
effective 
in 
promoting 
the 
humane 
treatment 
of 
workers 
through 
full 
transparency 
of 
their 
investigations. 
She 
said 
it 
holds 
the 
companies 
accountable in a way many 
other organizations do not. 
“Our 
commitment 
to 
transparency has really been 
a foundational principle,” 
Waxman said. “We don’t 
think of transparency as an 
end, but rather the means 

to an end. We believe in 
shining a light on working 
conditions 
and 
global 
supply chains because it 
promotes accountability and 
engenders trust.”
Waxman said there are a 
variety of challenges facing 
workers, but one of the most 
pressing was the fight for a 
fair wage. She claimed low 
wages harm both the worker 
and the company, adding 
workers have the right to 
compensation for a regular 
workweek to fit their basic 
needs and should have some 
discretionary income.
“One 
of 
the 
most 
pernicious 
challenges 
is 
fairly compensating workers 
— in other words, providing a 
livable wage,” Waxman said. 
“It’s not an exaggeration 
to say that chronically low 
wages are really an affront 
to the humanity and dignity 
of workers. They undermine 
the success of families and 
communities, 
and 
from 
the 
business 
perspective, 
can 
drain 
productivity, 
motivation 
and 
business 
success.”
Waxman 
concluded 
by discussing how many 
companies feel the need to 

produce as much as they 
can as fast as they can, 
which can negatively impact 
factory workers.
“There’s 
enormous 
pressure for brands and 
factories to produce things 
super quickly, and it really 
takes a toll on the people 
who work in them,” Waxman 
said.
LSA senior Ryan Rich 
said he attended the event 
in order to see how to enact 
change in these sectors. 
He said he came in without 
knowing much about the 
Fair Labor Association and 
was surprised to learn how 
effective it is in holding 
companies 
accountable 
through transparency.
“I didn’t know too much 
about 
this 
organization, 
but it really sounds like 
the 
people 
affiliated 
with them, with the Fair 
Labor 
Association, 
have 
committed and are being 
held accountable in a way 
I had never seen before,” 
Rich said. “There was a 
group, a very large group of 
companies and universities, 
that are willing to be held 
accountable. It’s rare.”

student Julia Oh Coxen 
explained why she joined 
the military. 
“Why I joined was very 
different from the reason 
why I wanted to stay,” 
said Coxen. “As a child 
of immigrant parents, I 
felt a very strong calling 
to do something for the 
nation that had done so 
much for us.” 
The 
panelists 
then 
discussed 
their 
decisions 
to 
retire 
from the military. Like 
Engineering 
senior 
Stefany Escobedo, who 
left 
the 
military 
to 
complete her education, 
Rackham 
student 
Ian 
Fishback felt he could 
contribute 
more 
to 
society 
as 
a 
scholar, 
reinforcing his decision 
to leave. On the other 
hand, Graznow said he 
left because he simply 
felt it was time to do so. 
“I joined the military 
when I was 18, and I felt 
when I was 24 — when 
I got out — that I had 
fulfilled 
my 
personal 
reasons for joining,” said 
Granzow. “It was time 
to do something else, to 
spread out, and I’ve been 
in school ever since.”
Following 
this 
discussion, 
Larson 
asked the panel whether 
they’d 
experienced 
moments 
when 
they’d 

been 
especially 
aware 
of their own and others’ 
identities during their 
years of service. 
Fishback 
said 
in 
his experience in the 
military, identities of race 
and gender were muted 
while other aspects of 
people’s 
personalities 
were 
highlighted. 
He 
explained there was a 
stark contrast between 
diversity in the military 
and outside it.
“There is less of an 
emphasis on skin color 
and 
categories, 
and 
more of an emphasis on 
seeing individuals and 
their 
backgrounds,” 
said 
Fishback. 
“Differences 
like 
race 
and 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 
were 
muted to a degree that 
people over here (at the 
University) just cannot 
understand.”
Granzow 
commented 
the focus on the job at 
hand 
overshadows 
the 
idea 
of 
caring 
about 
differences 
among 
comrades. 
“No one cares where 
you are from,” Granzow 
said. “No one cares how 
rich you are, no one cares 
about 
your 
religious 
beliefs 
or 
political 
beliefs. You have a job to 
do and you have to get it 
done.”
Granzow 
said 
the 
military helped expose 
him to the diversity of 
the 
United 
States. 
It 
was a stark contrast to 

his 
small 
hometown 
in 
Kansas 
— 
where 
everyone was white with 
a Christian background 
and 
similar 
political 
beliefs, he said.
“(In the military) we 
had people from both 
coasts, 
from 
Filipino 
backgrounds, 
Hispanic 
backgrounds, 
black 
backgrounds, 
Asian 
backgrounds — you name 
it, someone was from 
that background,” said 
Granzow. 
“I 
realized 
that at a fundamental 
level, this whole human 
tapestry is not just one 
thread. 
There 
(are) 
people from all over the 
place.”
The panel came to an 
end when Larson asked a 
question about what the 
panelist felt the military 
does well that society 
needs to catch up on.
Coxen said although 
the military has taken 
steps 
that 
strengthen 
aspects of integration of 
diversity, it is important 
to recognize it is a work 
in progress.
“There is still a lot 
of work to do. We are 
certainly not where we 
could be,” said Coxen. 
“Where I would say that 
the military does frankly 
very well is the gender 
pay gap. I would get paid 
exactly the same amount 
as a male counterpart 
with the same level of 
skill and training.”
Granzow agreed with 
Coxen’s 
statement. 
“They are getting rid 
of the gender divide in 
the fitness tests, and 
I think that’s a good 
step,” 
said 
Granzow. 
“I like how everyone 
is held to a certain 
objective standard.”
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The 
Daily 
after 
the 
panel’s 
discussion, 
President 
of the University of 
Michigan 
Student 
Veterans 
of 
America 
Stefany Escobedo, an 
Engineering 
senior, 
explained 
students 
from 
all 
racial 
and 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 
should 
feel encouraged to join 
the military due to the 
military’s emphasis on 
individual 
character 
rather than the social 
constructs of race or 
gender. 
“In my experience, 
what has counted more 
has been work ethic and 
integrity 
(compared 
to 
race 
or 
gender),” 
said 
Escobedo. 
“At 
the end of the day the 
great thing about the 
military, in my opinion, 
is that we’re focused on 
the mission and that’s 
what takes priority.”

The competition officially 
began 
on 
Oct. 
30. 
OSU 
was leading at the time 
of publication with 1,003 
donated pints of blood in 
comparison to University’s 
972. However, neither school 
has yet to garner half the 
number of donations they 
obtained 
last 
year, 
and 
Michigan 
has 
20 
drives 
scheduled in the coming 
weeks to continue collecting 
donations 
up 
until 
the 
deadline.
This past weekend was one 
of the Battle’s biggest events: 
Be a Hero. At this event, 
which took place on the Big 
House field, 456 pints of 
blood were donated.
Megan 
Podschlne 
is 
the program manager for 
Wolverines 
for 
Life, 
the 
parent organization to Blood 
Drives 
United. 
Podschlne 
described 
Wolverines 
for Life as a center for 
organizing 
“blood, 
organ, 
tissue, and bone marrow 
donations,” 
under 
which 
the domain of Blood Drives 
United squarely falls. 
Podschlne 
said 
in 
her 
experience 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine’s 
Transplant 
Center, donated blood is 
typically used for ER and 
surgical 
patients. 
Zeto 
reiterated the Red Cross’s 
assertion one pint of blood 
has the potential to save up 
to three lives.
LSA sophomore Spencer 
Wood first heard about the 
Blood Battle when a faculty 
member at his high school 
advised future Wolverines 
to 
participate. 
Already 
having been involved in Red 
Cross volunteer work, Wood 
said he was excited at the 
opportunity. He now helps 
with advertisement for the 
event.
In 
third 
grade, 
Wood 
was diagnosed with a blood 

disorder 
that 
required 
frequent transfusions and 
blood work.
“I wouldn’t be here today 
without that work,” Wood 
said. “Through that, I just 
wanted to help out in any 
way I could. And as long as 
I have been able, I’ve been 
donating three to five times a 
year ever since then.”
Business 
senior 
Vijita 
Kamath shared a similar 
story, though in her case, 
it was her mother who had 
benefited from donations in 
the past.
“My 
mother 
battled 
cancer for 10+ years, so a lot 
of my childhood was spent 
in 
and 
around 
hospitals 
learning about the need for 
transfusions and the acute 
shortage of blood,” Kamath 
wrote in a message to The 
Daily. “I learned I was a 
universal donor (O+) back 
then 
and 
encouraged 
to 
donate when I got older.” 
As 
an 
international 
student from India, Kamath 
had not been able to donate 
prior to this year’s Battle.
“The 
Red 
Cross 
has 
restrictions 
on 
eligibility 
if you have visited or had 
prolonged 
stay 
in 
any 
malaria or other disease-
affected regions,” Kamath 
said. “I first learned about 
this when I tried to donate 
as a sophomore and was 
answering 
the 
required 
questions during a walk-in. 
But I was ineligible since 
(I) had been home to India 
over the summer … This was 
the first time I had not been 
home for over 6 months, so I 
was eligible to donate.”
The annual Blood Battle 
is not the only opportunity 
University 
students 
and 
faculty have to donate blood. 
Blood Drives United hosts an 
additional drive in the winter 
which frequently puts the 
University into competition 
with other local or Big 10 
schools. Additionally, people 
are 
able 
to 
make 
blood 

donations as frequently as 
every eight weeks, according 
to the Red Cross.
Still, Wood and others 
said they believe the culture 
on a college campus, and 
specifically 
Michigan’s 
campus, 
makes 
it 
easier 
to solicit mass numbers of 
donations.
“I 
think 
there 
is 
a 
difference in doing it on your 
own, searching for random 
blood drives … and being a 
student, because one thing 
I tell people is, you’re not 
just donating for yourself,” 
Wood said. “You’re donating 
for other people, but on the 
other hand you’re donating 
on behalf of the University 
of Michigan. You’re able to 
exercise that name and do 
good will through that as 
well.”
Zeto said they’ve been 
trying year after year to 
make the drives increasingly 
convenient for students and 
staff. Especially considering 
the Union’s closing, Zeto 
said Blood Drives United 
has been pushing for the 
University 
community 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
dorm 
drives. They have also set up 
more opportunities to donate 
near athletic facilities, on 
North campus and at the 
hospital.
“It’s so easy,” Zeto said. 
“You go somewhere to study 
or you’re just hanging out 
and you have an hour of 
time to kill. Why not donate 
blood?”
Zeto 
noted 
this 
year’s 
Blood Battle comes on the 
heels 
of 
a 
recent 
blood 
shortage 
in 
Southeastern 
Michigan, directly affecting 
the way Michigan Medicine 
and other local healthcare 
entities are able to help their 
patients.

more

interested 
students

to

donor 
eligibility 
guidelines and a calendar of 
scheduled drives.

Dittmar said the University’s 
$12.4 
billion 
endowment, 
which is the ninth largest 
in the country, alleviates an 
addition $6,000 in costs per 
student on campus.
“So, if you were looking 
at what we use and gifts and 
proceeds 
from 
endowment, 
there’s 
about 
$6,400 
that 
each student on average is 
not paying, because a donor is 
paying those costs and either 
providing the aid or they may 
just be paying costs; they may 
be paying part of your faculty 
salaries; they may be paying 
for some kind of, you know, 
operations or programs in the 
building,” Dittmar said. “Those 
are costs that don’t have to be 
paid someplace else.”
CSG President Ben Gerstein 
presented on Giving Blueday 
2019, which CSG will use as a 
fundraising effort to continue 
the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship that originated 
in 2016. If fully funded, the 

scholarship would give $1,000 
in need-based aid to student 
leaders on campus.
Gerstein said there are many 
barriers that can keep student 
leaders from succeeding on 
campus.
“The 
mission 
of 
the 
scholarship, 
(that) 
was 
created three years ago, was 
recognizing that there are 
financial barriers to student 
leadership on campus, whether 
that is balancing work with 
potential involvement or other 
needs, or the cost of dues to 
join an organization,” Gerstein 
said. “There are a bunch 
of barriers that low socio-
economic 
status 
students 
face to being a student leader 
on campus, and it ranges 
from all different types of 
organizations.”
In 
addition, 
Gerstein 
presented on the importance 
of an assembly-wide climate 
demographic survey to assess 
diversity within the student 
government before yielding 
his presentation time to allow 
for members to fill out the 
survey.

Gerstein said the survey, 
and checking in on diversity in 
student leadership, is critical 
to understanding the needs of 
the student body.

“The 
Leadership 

Engagement Scholarship was 
actually born out of one of the 
first 
demographic 
surveys, 
realizing the lack of socio-
economic diversity in student 
leadership,” 
Gerstein 
said. 
“The survey is really important 
to go out, because it allows 
for us as an organization — 
collectively not just separated 
by an executive branch of the 
legislative branch — to have a 
solid assessment about where 
we need to make our own 
internal improvements to the 
inclusivity and diversity of our 
organization.”
Following executive reports, 
the assembly discussed and 
confirmed 
five 
members 
to 
various 
CSG 
positions, 
including 
three 
students 
as associate justices of the 
Central Student Judiciary.

As 
Schlissel 
said, 
the 
debate 
will 
bring 
additional police presence 
to 
campus 
to 
protect 
students 
physically. 
However, 
Asidao 
said 
having more security could 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on some members of the 
community. 
“I think for some of our 
students, 
knowing 
that 
the University is really 
thinking 
about 
campus 
security 
can 
be 
really 
helpful,” 
Asidao 
said. 
“For some of our students, 
the relationship in terms 
of 
having, 
maybe, 
an 
increased police presence 
may 
actually 
be 
more 
anxiety provoking in some 
ways because of what has 
happened for some of our 
students feeling targeted 
and feeling like there’s 
more scrutiny, in terms of 
their own multiple social 
identities, and maybe being 

targets of what’s perceived 
as 
unfair 
targeting 
by 
security. I think it’s going 
to be a mixed bag.”
Fysudeen said she would 
appreciate the additional 
police 
presence, 
but 
doesn’t think it is an all-
encompassing 
solution. 
Physical safety will not 
prevent 
students 
from 
feeling unsafe on campus, 
she said.
“I think as long as our 
safety is being thought of 
proactively 
rather 
than 
reactively, as long as those 
safe spaces are made, I 
think 
this 
tension 
can 
be, you know, addressed 
successfully,” 
Fysudeen 
said. “I think that there’s 
something to be said there 
positively. And so, I think 
that’s a great sentiment, but 
I also think it’s just going 
to be a lot of psychological 
and emotional strain on 
students. And I don’t think 
that there’s a way that 
physical safety often can 
mitigate that.”
Asidao said the potential 

psychological 
impact 
of 
this debate on students 
could manifest itself in a 
variety of ways, but she 
predicts there will be an 
underlying sense of anxiety 
in many of the feelings that 
may come up. 
“(The 
psychological 
impact) can come in a 
variety of different ways, 
but one of the things we 
have 
seen 
is 
just 
this 
increased sense of anxiety, 
just 
worry,” 
Asidao 
said. “Worry in terms of 
personal safety, worry in 
terms of the future, worry 
in terms of what might be 
coming, worry for their 
own sense of people within 
their 
community, 
being 
worried about their peers 
… For some of our students, 
it may also increase some 
depressive 
symptoms, 
feelings of sadness, feelings 
of hopelessness. For some 
of our students, it can 
also bring up any previous 
traumatic experiences in 
their lives.”

They wrote the book on #MeToo

Buybacks are not the solution

W

hat do we do with 
art made by bad 
men? This is the 
question many people asked in 
the aftermath of the #MeToo 
movement. 
We 
collectively 
turned our attention not to 
the court cases filed by U.S. 
attorneys 
and 
victims 
of 
these bad men’s violent and 
often illegal behavior, nor 
to the systems that enabled 
their predatory behavior to 
go unpunished for decades, 
but to the movies, TV shows, 
books, albums, journalism and 
poetry they made. What are 
we to do? Discard our fave’s 
stand-up special or hit record? 
We chose to simultaneously 
turn away from the survivors 
looking us in the eye, the 
gutsy 
and 
courageous 
women who came forward to 
recount how these bad men 
sexually violated them, from 
workplace 
harassment 
to 
rape. Instead, we asked what 
all this meant for us. Is it OK 
to listen to that song or watch 
that movie? Am I still allowed 
to read that book or stream 
that podcast? Is it unethical 
to call an Uber or shop at 
Barnes & Noble? 
In 
a 
way, 
this 
is 
understandable. How could 
we not? Our entire world 
is constructed out of an 
androcratic order, by the work 
of men who sit untouched on 
thrones of power. If we had 
to discard their work, what 
would we have left? 
In some realms, practically 
nothing.
Almost two years after 
the initial reporting that led 
to the #MeToo movement — 
the original phrase coined 
by 
activist 
Tarana 
Burke 
— we’re getting a peek at a 
world in which predatory 
men are not emboldened, and 
those courageous enough to 
challenge their power are not 
silenced. 
“She Said” was published on 
Sept. 10, 2019. The book was 
written by New York Times 
journalists Jodi Kantor and 
Megan Twohey who detailed 
their 
reporting 
on 
movie 
producer Harvey Weinstein’s 
sexual misconduct and Prof. 
Christine 
Blasey 
Ford’s 
Senate testimony. Two weeks 
later, “Know My Name” was 
published, 
revealing 
the 
identity of Chanel Miller, who 
was raped by Brock Turner. 
Turner 
was 
infamously 

sentenced to only six months 
in jail after being convicted of 
three counts of sexual assault. 
Until the book’s publication, 
Miller had only been publicly 
identified as Emily Doe, and 
was known for the powerful 
victim statement she made at 
Turner’s sentencing hearing. 
On Oct. 15, “Catch and Kill,” 
written 
by 
Ronan 
Farrow 
and detailing his reporting 
on Weinstein and how NBC 
executives tried to kill the 
story, was also published. 
Each of these books is 
distinct, 
offering 
different 
perspectives 
of 
the 
same 
gruesome, 
complex 
system 
in which powerful men are 
protected and empowered to 
violate women. “She Said,” 
written in the third person, 
offers an extensive probe into 
exactly how men like Harvey 
Weinstein were protected by 
secretive 
settlements 
paid 
for by their employers, severe 
nondisclosure 
agreements 
and 
aggressive 
lawyers. 
These lawyers include include 
Lisa Bloom, who proclaims 
herself a feminist advocate. 
Contrastingly, Ronan Farrow’s 
“Catch and Kill” reads like 
a spy novel, illustrating just 
how 
cloak-and-dagger 
his 
reporting process was, from 
being 
followed 
by 
former 
Mossad 
agents 
to 
being 
warned to get a gun. “Know 
My 
Name,” 
though, 
is 
a 
tender, stunning book written 
by a gifted writer about the 
interiority of being a survivor, 
as well as undergoing Turner’s 
rape trial and living publicly 
as Emily Doe. 
Yet, together, the trio join 
as one refrain, melodious in 
its force and efficacy. For 
decades, women, as survivors 
of gender-based violence from 
intimate partner violence to 
sexual assault, have written 
about how men have violently 
and illegally violated them. 
And in many cases, women 
continue to be silenced. This 
is precisely why these books 
are so important. 
It is important to note 
that these books are a part 
of a long tradition of women 
writing about sexual traumas 
from more recent books like 
“Not That Bad,” edited by 
Roxane Gay, “Indelible in 
the 
Hippocampus,” 
edited 
by Shelly Oria and “Nobody’s 
Victim,” by Carrie Goldberg, 
to older works such as the 

1994 National Book Award 
for 
Nonfiction 
finalist 
“Strange Justice: The Selling 
of Clarence Thomas” by Jill 
Abramson and Jane Mayer. 
Abramson and Mayer’s work is 
particularly relevant today for 
detailing the mishandling of 
Anita Hill’s testimony during 
Clarence 
Thomas’s 
U.S. 
Supreme Court nomination 
hearings by the Senate — 
and, 
in 
particular, 
then-
Senate Judiciary Committee 
chairman Joe Biden.
“She 
Said” 
and 
“Catch 
and Kill” are journalistic in 
nature. All three of these 
books pick up the work of 
past generations of women 
— second- and third-wave 
feminists 
who 
attended 
consciousness-raising groups 
and women’s liberation rallies 
and in turn pushed forward 
progress for generations of 
women after them. These 
books exist as monuments to 
their progress and painful 
reminders of the work still to 
be done. 
All of these books are — or 
at least should be — required 
reading. While I am prone to 
eye rolling and groaning when 
a man whines about #MeToo 
going too far or laments the 
suddenly-terminated careers 
of bad men as if they have 
been mortally wounded, I am 
receptive to what New York 
Magazine journalist Rebecca 
Traister explains as men who 
will inevitably be penalized 
for behavior that was once 
socially tolerated but is no 
longer accepted in 2019. With 
#MeToo, we are changing 
the rules in the middle of the 
game. There are some men 
raised to understand certain 
behaviors as common and 
accepted (though it should be 
noted Weinstein was probably 
never raised to believe rape 
was OK) who find that those 
same behaviors are no longer 
acceptable and might actually 
be punishable. 
For these men, and for the 
boys growing up in the next 
generation, 
the 
would-be 
Brock Turners and Harvey 
Weinsteins 
of 
the 
world, 
these books are an essential 
roadmap to a world in which 
they are not owed sex and 
access to women’s bodies by 
virtue of their rights as men.

O

n Oct. 27, a shooting 
near 
Greenville, 
Texas, left two dead 
and at least 14 injured. Maybe 
it’s just a stroke of callousness, 
but is anyone really surprised 
at 
this 
point? 
If 
anyone 
was going to be surprised 
by anything regarding this 
mass shooting, it would be 
that more people didn’t fall 
victim. In October 2017, a 
shooting at a music festival 
in Las Vegas took the lives of 
58 people and injured almost 
500 others. In February 2018, 
17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School students and 
staff died at the hands of a 
deranged killer, marking one 
of the most traumatic times 
in modern American history. 
This year, on Aug. 3 and Aug. 
4, 22 people died and 24 were 
injured in a shooting in El 
Paso, Texas, and nine people 
died and 27 were injured in a 
shooting in Dayton, Ohio. Also 
this year, in Odessa, Texas, 
on Sept. 1, seven people were 
killed and 22 were injured. 
How 
can 
anyone 
be 
surprised? 
It’s 
not 
that 
people don’t care for the 
lives lost. Quite the opposite. 
People have been caring, but 
nothing has been done to 
address the clear epidemic of 
mass shootings in America. 
The issue of guns has been 
stuck in legislative gridlock. 
Democrats continue to beg 
for stronger, more stringent 
gun 
control. 
Republicans 
argue guns are an ingrained 
aspect of American history. 
Instead of defaulting to the 
ever-present straw manning 
that dominates the current 
political landscape, it’s time 
to take an honest look at 
both sides of the gun control 
debate, and in particular, the 
proposal of a gun buyback.
Some argue that if guns 

were removed from American 
society, criminals would use 
other means to endanger 
the innocent. That might be 
true on an individual scale, 
but not so true on a national 
one. After the shooting in 
El Paso, former Democratic 
presidential candidate Beto 
O’Rourke spoke passionately 
about gun reform, proposing 
a national buyback program. 
Most people on both sides 
of the aisle point to the 
Australian buyback program 
of 
1996. 
Progressives 
point to the fact that after 
the 
buyback, 
Australian 
homicide 
plummeted. 
However, conservatives look 
to the fact that the homicide 
rate actually spiked shortly 
after the buyback and then 
declined at a similar rate to 
before the buyback. 
At this point, a buyback 
program 
doesn’t 
look 
to 
significantly 
affect 
the 
number of homicides on a 
national scale. If there could 
be 
any 
association 
made 
with homicides, it wouldn’t 
be with guns, but rather 
with the eras in which these 
homicides 
were 
occuring. 
Homicides spiked in the U.S. 
during the late 1990s, but 
in the 2000s subsequently 
declined with no comparable 
national gun control reform 
to that of Australia. 
Additionally, some argue 
the overabundance of guns 
in America is a contributing 
factor to the current gun 
crisis. At first, it would 
seem that way. Admittedly, 
America has an obsession 
with 
guns. 
There 
are 
currently more guns than 
there are people in the U.S. 
Think 
about 
that. 
When 
looking 
at 
that 
statistic, 
any sensible person would 
think the prevalence of guns 

would have an undeniable 
link 
to 
gun 
violence 
in 
America. But it doesn’t. In 
data published by the FBI 
listing the number of guns 
and events of gun violence 
per year in 2010, they found 
that the data establishing the 
connection 
between 
guns 
and gun-murder rate exhibits 
an R-squared value of 0.0031. 
This suggests the possibility 
of correlation between gun 
murder and gun possession is 
close to none. 
Obviously, 
the 
biggest 
issue with guns is their 
capacity to kill. In the Dayton 
shooting, the shooter was 
able to kill nine people just 
in 32 seconds before being 
neutralized by authorities. 
In 
10 
minutes, 
58 
were 
dead during the Las Vegas 
shooting. With the removal 
of 
guns 
from 
American 
society, surely threats to the 
public could be minimized. 
On the other hand, guns give 
the people the right to defend 
themselves against threats. 
Over time, gun purchases 
have skyrocketed, but certain 
types of gun-related crime 
have plummeted. Enshrined 
in the Constitution, arms 
are an afforded right, and 
the only way to remove guns 
as such would be through 
near impossible bipartisan 
support. Even more so, such 
a 
constitutional 
shakeup 
would continue to destabilize 
the current political space. 
The solution, as of now, is 
not clear, and it’s asinine 
to suggest that one broad 
buyback 
program 
would 
solve anything regarding the 
expansive crisis that involves 
guns, 
mental 
health 
and 
culture.

O

f the three campus tours 
I took prior to enrolling 
at the University of 
Michigan, the most memorable 
highlight from each trip up 
to Ann Arbor was the Martha 
Cook 
Residence 
Hall. 
The 
tour guides I had as a high 
schooler emphasized how this 
building was the embodiment 
of pure feminine class at the 
University and one of the only 
all-female dormitories left. As 
a result, I’ve had this magical 
ideal of the women who live in 
Martha Cook cemented as old-
fashioned, proper students who 
have mandatory tea times and 
cannot speak to boys past 10 
p.m. 
Attending my first ever Friday 
teatime, I realized the stark 
inaccuracy of my assumptions 
about 
these 
women. 
Many 
sported U-M Computer Science 
or Biology T-shirts, and I saw 
an M-Boxing backpack. I also 
heard chats about Ross classes 
and biological anthropology 
lectures. The atmosphere of 
Martha Cook is welcoming, 
and immediately when you 
walk into Martha Cook, you are 
greeted by the sweet smells of 
delectable baked goods set out 
in the main hall and the warm 
smiles on everyone’s faces. 
On your right, there is the 
magnificent Red Room with 
deep, soft, red carpet and the 
larger-than-life-size 
portrait 
of Martha Cook herself. The 
Sparking Room connects the 
Red and Gold Rooms, where 
men from the Law Quad used 
to wait on their ladies and chat 
in the late hours of the early 
1900s. Under the high-arching 
ceilings of the Gold Room, 
everyone sits together on sofas, 
armchairs or on the floor at the 
feet of their friends, sipping 
on Friday tea. The century-old 
books and records showcased 
in each of these rooms are 
telling of the vast history the 
building possesses. Beautiful 
woodwork of the early 20th 
century envelopes each room, 
and 
the 
white, 
geometric 
ceilings declare they’ve heard a 
hundred years of conversation 
beneath them. 
Over 
the 
past 
century, 
Martha 
Cook 
has 
housed 
countless women who have 
contributed 
much 
to 
the 
University. Reflecting on the 
100th-anniversary celebration 

of Martha Cook in 2015, I 
wondered just what it meant 
for the three all-female dorms 
on campus to be just that: 
all-female. 
The 
exclusivity 
raises potential quarrels, and I 
questioned what this may mean 
for nonbinary or transgender 
students wanting to live in 
non-coed dorms. Researching 
gender-inclusive 
housing 
at 
Michigan, I found a partnership 
between the University and 
the Spectrum Center called 
the Gender Inclusive Living 
Experience. GILE is located 
in East Quad, and students of 
any gender are allowed to be a 
part of the community. Upon 
joining GILE, residents agree 
to respect and use desired 
names and pronouns, value all 
social identities, support each 
other and commit to expanding 
inclusivity, among other things. 
This program is especially 
great for first-year students, 
allowing a family environment 
where everyone is accepting 
and aware — something that 
can be incorporated into the 
rest of their undergraduate 
experience. 
However, 
GILE 
is one of the only residential 
programs 
on 
campus 
that 
exists to fully emulate gender-
inclusivity 
and 
deconstruct 
the binary nature of gender. 
Even more so, if students who 
identify with the residents of 
GILE want a non-coed dorm, 
there are currently no options 
for 
them. 
Consequently, 
Martha Cooks’s board has held 
recent discussions of what 
being an all-female dorm on 
Michigan’s campus means and 
how the definition of gender 
may need to change in order to 
be more inclusive for nonbinary 
and transgender students.
University housing has made 
a push in the right direction for 
inclusive restrooms and coed 
halls, but accessibility can be 
difficult to navigate. While it 
really sucks having to go up to 
the third floor of the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library 
to 
find a restroom, it sucks way 
more when there isn’t a single 
gender-inclusive restroom in 
the entire building. The “dear 
colleague” letter in 2016 from 
the 
Obama 
administration 
pushed 
residential 
colleges 
and universities to provide 
adequate 
housing 
for 
transgender 
students 
or 

potentially risk losing federal 
funding. The policies are not 
just for transgender student 
accommodations, 
but 
they 
also push for the negation of 
the gender-binary in general, 
with 
university 
housing 
and 
communal 
situations. 
Thinking back to our own 
room-assignment application 
process prior to freshman 
year, 
many 
students 
were 
only allowed to select same-
sex roommates. These “dear 
colleague” 
policies 
also 
work to help siblings who 
want to live together, gay 
students wanting to live with 
heterosexual friends of the 
opposite 
gender 
and 
even 
friend 
groups 
comfortable 
with mixed-gender dormitory 
situations. 
Though there are select 
residential 
programs 
on 
campus 
that 
are 
strictly 
gender-inclusive, the goal is to 
make each residential program 
on campus welcoming and 
safe for all students. Housing 
policies 
and 
traditional 
practices 
on 
campus 
that 
assume students are either 
rigidly male or female fail 
to represent nonbinary and 
transgender students. College 
administrators, 
housing 
applications and residential 
board members must adopt 
procedures 
that 
recognize 
diverse 
gender 
identities, 
expressions and transitions. 
Applications 
that 
solely 
ask if a student is male or 
female fail to recognize the 
inherent and full complexity 
of gender identity, but they 
also 
miss 
the 
opportunity 
to 
provide 
sufficient 
data 
for 
roommate 
assignments 
and comprehensive comfort. 
Addressing 
gender-inclusive 
issues 
and 
beginning 
to 
welcome transgender students 
would 
effectively 
work 
to 
strengthen 
the 
history 
of 
powerful 
women 
within 
the 
residences’ 
halls. 
For 
this 
reason, 
Martha 
Cook 
certainly appears to be moving 
in the right direction, and 
the 
powerful, 
progressive 
women in this dormitory act 
to consolidate the process 
and verify the importance of 
gender inclusiveness.

When most people think of the phrase “clams casino,” they 
think of the popular clam dish. In this case, clams casino is a 
clam on the half shell, covered in butter, garlic, peppers, bacon 
and breadcrumbs. It is an exceedingly popular appetizer in 
New England, and who can blame them? If you like clams and 
bacon and peppers and butter, I’m sure it’s the perfect dish, but 
in my mind, clams casino the appetizer is only the second most 
important Clams Casino.
The most important and most influential clams casino is, of 
course, the now-legendary cloud-rap producer. Clams Casino 
got his start crafting ethereal, sample-driven beats for the likes 
of Lil B, A$AP Rocky and Mac Miller in 2011. At the time, no 
other producer was making beats like Clams, and if they tried, 
they wouldn’t sound anywhere near as good as Clams. In 2016, 
he released his solo debut album 32 Levels featuring the usual 

suspect (Lil B, ASAP Rocky and Vince Staples) 
and some new collaborators like Kelela, Alt-J’s 
Joe Newman and Future Islands’s Samuel T. 
Herring. It was a spectacle. A damn good one 
at that, too.
With his most recent release, Moon Trip 
Radio, Clams Casino has decided to take a 
different approach. Rather than creating an 
album flooded with outside voices, he decided 
to keep things in-house and let the beats speak 
for themselves. Evidently, this decision was a 
good one because Moon Trip Radio is, no doubt, 
Clams Casino’s most cohesive and infectious 
work to date. 
Lead single and album opener “Rune” is 
a slow-burning track, but once it gets going, 
it is white-hot. It’s classic Clams in the best 
way possible. A down-pitched vocal sample 
dominates the track and is backed by stuttering 
drums and warm bell tones. It takes almost two 
minutes and 40 seconds to reach the drop, but 
when the time finally comes, there’s nothing 
better.
Not only is Moon Trip Radio Clams’s most 
cohesive work, but it’s also the warmest 
and most inviting. Clams brings listeners into his world and 
encourages them to stay awhile and explore the landscape. Songs 
like “Healing” and “Twilit” have so many layers for listeners to 
pick apart, from field recordings to resonating piano tones. In 
particular, though, “Fire Blue” begs to be explored. It’s almost 
cavernous in a way; it’s contained far below the surfaces of the 
earth, but it’s also monumental in size. Clams gives the droning 
main sample plenty of room to breath by utilizing minimalistic 
drum hits and synth blasts. The only problem is, once the song 
begins to show its true colors, it abruptly ends, sending listeners 
to the next soundscape.
The flaws (if they’re even there) of Moon Trip Radio never 
make themselves apparent. Sometimes though, it can be hard 

to maintain focus on songs like “Lyre” and “In a Mirror.” 
They’re a little too ambient, a little too aimless, especially when 
surrounded by chillers like “Twilit” and “Soliloquy.” To be 
certain, they’re good tracks, but they should’ve been scattered 
throughout the album rather than back-to-back on the album’s 
backend.
The beats on Moon Trip Radio are definitely chill, but no one 
should ever attempt to study while listening to them — there’s 
just too much to explore. Someone could listen to this album fifty 
times and continue to find new pieces or textures that they never 
noticed before. Moon Trip Radio presents a vast soundscape in 
which everyone is welcome to explore at their leisure, and that’s 
a good thing, because after one listen you’ll never want to leave.

Pulling off fantasy in movies is hard enough. Adapting 
an entire trilogy to TV is harder. When the 2007 film “The 
Golden Compass” received harsh reviews, it seemed that may 
have been the end of attempting to adapt Phillip Pullman’s 
wildly popular fantasy series. “His Dark Materials” however, 
seeks to revisit the series and explore the world it creates.
Based off the popular trilogy of the same name, “His Dark 
Materials” follows a young girl named Lyra Belacqua (Dafne 
Keen, “Logan”) as she investigates the many secrets within 
her society, run by the oppressive Magisterium. Inspired by 
her uncle, Lord Asriel (James McAvoy, “It Chapter Two”), 
and his work in the northern territories, Lyra learns of a 
mysterious “Dust” that the Magisterium is hiding from the 
public and Asriel’s fellow scholars. 
In the midst of her life at Jordan College in Oxford, 
England, Lyra discovers that her childhood friend, Roger, and 
a boy from a neighboring community have been kidnapped, 
presumably by a group called “The Gobblers.” With the help of 
her animal familiar Pantalaimon (Kit Connor, “Rocketman”) 
and the gift of a golden compass, Lyra and a fellow explorer 
Marisa Coulter (Ruth Wilson, “Luther”) sets out to uncover 
the truth being concealed from the people.
While the visuals and world built in “His Dark Materials” 
are undoubtedly beautiful, nothing about the show so far 
sticks out as particularly incredible. In the backdrop of 
a magical, Lyra’s world is more akin to “Harry Potter” or 

“Lord of the Rings” than a fresh take on the fantasy genre. 
The show’s relationship with its source material seems to be 
its greatest weakness: Every piece of dialogue and exposition 

feels inaccessible to viewers not familiar with the book 
series, yet “His Dark Materials” feels far too generic to be 
unique.

Within the series premiere, very little about the main 
characters or their world is explained, which may be fine for 
a better-known series, but Pullman’s fantasy trilogy seems 
too niche to be understood by a wide audience automatically. 
“His Dark Materials” doesn’t seem interested in answering 
questions and would rather revel in its magical imagery 
and government conspiracy subplot than make its storyline 
clear. 
“His Dark Materials” has a lot of wonderful elements, 
but seems to struggle with how best to put them together 
for an undefined target audience. Not quite a kids’ show 
and definitely not “adult” by any HBO standards, the series 
doesn’t seem to know what its purpose is. The only thing 
propelling the story forward so far is a vague prophecy 
purposefully kept from the audience for suspense. In 
concealing the plot like this, “His Dark Materials” has 
lowered its own stakes in an attempt to raise them. With 
a significant reliance on these types of fantasy tropes, the 
show fails to bring a unique or nuanced take on its own genre. 
After 
an 
underwhelming 
first 
episode, 
“His 
Dark 
Materials” could redeem itself with a more self-aware first 
season that acknowledges the well-worn territory of fantasy 
while leaning into what separates Pullman’s original trilogy 
from the pack. Instead of simply mentioning “Dust” or the 
“Magisterium” or “Gobblers,” “His Dark Materials” could 
embrace its own mythology directly and focus on its most 
compelling details without overusing broader themes. With 
some modifications, this adaptation could work. Without 
revision, the show may fade into the same obscurity its film 
equivalent “The Golden Compass” did.

Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders emerged from the 
stylings of Foo Fighters in the same way the latter did from 
Nirvana. In 2004, before Foo Fighters even started working on In 
Your Honor, drummer Hawkins pulled together a group of himself, 
Chris Chaney and Gannin Arnold for their debut self-titled album. 
The 2006 release bubbled under the radar but generated a steady 
interest with rock fans and Foo Fighters devotees. It placed rock’s 
favorite grungy surfer dude at the forefront with more leisure for 
humor in rock music than Foo Fighters could ever permit — albeit 
with a not too dissimilar sound. The Coattail Riders made their 
return in 2010 with Red Light Fever, reuniting the trio alongside 
a star spangled set of features including Brian May, Roger Taylor, 
Elliot Easton and, you guessed it, Dave Grohl. Not surprisingly, 

Queen influences tinged many tracks on the album. 
And perhaps it was Hawkins’s destined inferiority to Dave 
Grohl, or the waning traction for grunge rock, or the important 
business of keeping up as Foo Fighters’s drummer, but the follow-
up for Fever seemed out of scope. Nearly a decade passed without 
so much of a mention. However, at the very tail end of 2019, we 
finally reach a continuation with Get the Money.
If Red Hot Fever was star-spattered, Get the Money is the Ringo’s 
All-Stars of punk-rock. The album features contributions from 
Dave Grohl, Jon Davison, Nancy Wilson, LeAnn Rimes, Roger 
Taylor, Pat Smear and Mark King. Queen is yet again a touchstone 
for Hawkins’s work, squealing guitar tips marking up track “Don’t 
Look at Me That Way.” Classic rock influences touch nearly every 
track. “Middle Age” beckons back to the rock age ruled by David 
Bowie in the ’80s. A loving dedication to Hawkins’s daughter, 
the track carries itself on angle-grinder guitars and thrashing 
harmonies that feed into a synthy outro. It shouldn’t work given 
the lyrical content, and it’s arguably doesn’t by 
the end of the song.
Maybe the coattails he’s riding on are his 
own; synth-laden metal intro “Crossed the 
Line” burrows a snippet of Foo Fighters’s 
“Best to You.” Grohl makes three appearances 
across the album. Most notable is his feature 
on lead single “I Really Blew It,” not so much 
for his impressive, shrieking guitar but for 
his screaming “I really blew it” repeatedly 
throughout the intro. This is encapsulated 
perfectly in the track’s music video, with his 
disembodied head in a fireplace yelling. 
Title track “Get the Money,” much like the 
rest of the album, is a labyrinth of genres. A 
psych-inflicted folk intro settles into a reggae 
groove that reverts back before an absolute 
guitar freakout that carries the last quarter of 
the song. Similarly, “C U in Hell” begins with 
a classic rock edge that morphs into a psych 
rock element with spattered piano keys before 
locking into a classic Fighters-esquechorus. 
The lyrics, however, run trite. Hawkins croons 
cliches throughout the song and especially in 
the chorus: “Maybe these oaths were made/ To 
be broken/ Maybe these paths we take/ Have 

been chosen.” The same unfortunately rings true for the rest of 
the album. “Kiss the Ring” presents perhaps the most creative 
and crude rework, “You’re my queen/ And I’m your King/ I wanna 
give you everything/ All you gotta do is kiss the ring.” 
Despite its shortcomings, Get the Money does enough with its 
classic rock worship and synth to not reinvent but toy with the 
wheel a bit. In an age of music absolutely regulated by the push 
and pull of media, rock is in a vulnerable state; it makes sense for 
rock albums with classic artists like Taylor Hawkins to beckon 
back to the sound of rock from the past. This is not to say that rock 
is dead so much as it is to suggest that the shifts of the playing 
field permit more variety in the ways we consume and consider 
music — there’s no classic or grunge rock categories that prevail 
anymore. Rather, rock and its newest artists have made names for 
themselves by implementing newer elements. Hawkins, however, 
has no interest in this and there’s nothing wrong with that. 
Inspired by the oldies, the album feels a lot like it’s for fans of the 
classics too.

MIDWESTERN COLUMN

In 1965, Michigan boldly declared itself 
a “Water Winter Wonderland.” They even 
slapped it on their license plates. This is 
awfully brazen, given that man has hated 
winter since long before Jack London snuffed 
a man out in the Yukon for his inability to 
build a fire. The fact of the matter is that the 
Upper Midwest is a cold place. Michigan is 
shaped like a form of winter attire, so I’m not 
sure what you expected. 
Winter 
is 
an 
institution, 
stubbornly 
persisting from November to March. With it 
comes the trusted fundamentals: the ghostly 
white film on our clothes left by slush, the 
ice clinging to our windows, the cold that 
squeezes our toes and fingers. The first snow 
is upon us, and I promise this is a good thing. 
Winter is more than hellish, white-knuckled 
driving conditions. It comes every year, for 
more better than worse, if only you’d let 
yourself get lost in it.
The cold doesn’t hurt so bad if you keep 
moving. The frigid sting of winter is a 
lethargic miscreant, easily outwitted and 
dodged. The most effective method of evasion 
is purely up to your preference. For the daring, 
go to Muskegon, where you can slide down 
an Olympic-sized luge track, which will send 
you hurtling down 750 winding feet of ice. If 
you prefer less of a downhill slope, Muskegon 
also has a quarter-mile ice track that 
ambles through the woods between skinny 
evergreens. Or perhaps you’d rather traverse 
one of Michigan’s 6,500 snowmobile trails, say 
in Cadillac or Grayling. You could also spend 

a winter with man’s best friend, heading to 
McMillian in the U.P. for a 20-mile dog sled 
trip.
Many see snow as a glacial blanket, 
suffocating and snuffing out the beauty of 
fall. But my fellow midwesterners tell me 
that waking up to a yard full of snow where 
there was none the night before — with the 
trees lined with little white clumps and the 
car covered so heavily that only its imprint 
is recognizable — is one of the most beautiful 
things ever. Especially when it’s followed by a 
surprise phone call from the school district, 
freeing you from your societal burden of 
school.
I have only ever fallen in love in wintertime. 
I have fallen in love with tall firs and pinecones 
and the way you can feel hot coffee warm you 
all the way down to your toes when you sip 
it outside. I have fallen in love with people 
and places, with words like “blustery” and 
“boreal,” with the sight of foxes dancing alone 
in a heimal field. Where there are cold ears 
and fingers, there are warm hearts, begging to 
be warmer still.
Have you ever followed deer tracks through 
a snowy field? Have you heard an elk call echo 
through the barren trees? Have you ever held 
someone’s hand and it started snowing? Snow 
is what you make it. Snow is an opportunity to 
be reminded that there is beauty here. Maybe 
it isn’t always obvious. Maybe it stings a little 
if you throw a ball of it at someone’s face (that 
goes for snow and beauty). But it’s there. It’s 
there and it wants you to know it, to follow it, 
to trace it out in your front yard by laying down 
in a big pile of it and coming back up an angel.
Have you played in the snow yet? Have you 
reminded yourself what it means to be alive?

Warm up to the winter and
find the beauty in the snow

MAXWELL SCHWARZ
Daily Midwestern Columnist

But my fellow midwesterners tell me that waking 
up to a yard full of snow where there was none 
before — with the trees lined with little white 
clumps and the car covered so heavily that only 
its imprint is recognizable — is one of the most 
beautiful things ever. 

The overarching themes of Elaine Equi’s 
poetry collection “The Intangibles” are not 
difficult to grasp: critiques of materialism 
and technological dependence. But in a world 
saturated by older generations bemoaning the 
death of social interactions and demonizing 
younger adults for using technology, Equi’s 
claims 
seem 
tired 
and 
outdated. 
Take, 
for example, part of her poem “Hello”: “I 
remember when people / used their hands to 
gesture / and would meet each other’s eyes / 
with curiosity or annoyance.” It’s a clear “back 
in my day” moment. She continues, referring to 
smartphones, “but now everyone looks down, 
/ studying their palms intently.” Her point is 
understandable and culturally relevant, but 
that does not prevent it from feeling like an 
old woman wagging her finger at “kids these 
days.” 
Equi is in danger of losing entire audiences 
as she is dismissed with an “OK, boomer” 
(She was born in 1953, making this statement 
accurate). Her poetry on the subject of 
technology is only marginally more eloquent 
than the comics about tech-addicted teenagers 
that Gen Z’s grandparents post to Facebook. 
She yearns for the glory days, when people 
“radiated oneness” and “knew how to inhabit 
a moment.” Now, of course, in a world 
populated by the youth, this world has all but 
disappeared. It has been replaced — according 
to Equi — with one populated by materialistic, 
unthinking, tech-addled masses with minute 
attention spans and no appreciation for 
poetry. We are merely “flitting from screen to 
screen,” and “if something was unpleasant, we 
deleted it.” Her platitudinous argument would 
not be complete without a critique of social 
relations and how they have been affected by 
technology, so the lines “And if we happened 
to lose a friend, / hundreds more were ready to 
take their place” barely even register. Hers is 
an argument the world has heard a thousand 
times over. 
Her poetry on this point is also sometimes 
too clunky to be impactful. When her point 
is more understated, the resulting poetry is 
more beautiful: “We will not need the old 
language / they took and ground to numeric 
sand.” But the lines, and entire poems, that 
seek to contribute to her larger message of 
the dangers of technology often fall flat, like 
“The big stories — peckish news / gets told 
in tweets.” Her heavy-handedness impedes 
poems that have nothing to do with technology 
as well. The lines describing a perfume 
bottle “a forest, an ocean, / a mountain — / a 
whole kingdom / in these glass towers” are 
thoughtful and defamiliarizing, summoning 
an everyday object in a completely new and 
more imaginative way. But her poetry is 
only effective up until the point of over-
explanation. In the same poem as the perfume 
bottle description, she says, “No shape / takes 
place / in time / without smell.” These lines 
are especially frustrating because they exist so 
close to the other more strange and wonderful 
lines about the same exact feeling. But while 
the first description makes the reader think 
and presents an emotion or concept in a new 
way, the second simply states that emotion. 
Where the first is dexterous, the second is 
graceless. Equi underestimates her audience’s 
ability to understand — perhaps because she 

thinks we are tech-obsessed sheep — and 
therefore her poetry sacrifices some emotional 
power to the grail of complete understanding. 
Equi actually does her best work in this 
collection when she is not trying to make a 
point. The most memorable and remarkable 
poems in the book are also the most subtle. 
For instance, almost no poems discuss family, 
but the one that does — an outlier — does so 
elegantly. Equi describes a recurring dream 
that both she and her mom have as a “genetic 
trait, a locket / handed from one generation to 
the next.” She captures the nonsensical quality 
of a dream and distills it to a particular feeling 
of loneliness that could only be remedied by a 
mother. She yearns for a moment in this lonely, 
wandering dream in which she and her mother 
“stopped for a moment, embraced, / and shared 
a cup of tea.” The poem does not necessarily fit 
into the larger themes of the collection, but it 
still manages to hold its own better than most 
of the ones that do fit. 
Equi’s other strength has nothing to do 
with content and everything to do with sound. 
Some of her poems focus exclusively on sonic 
portrayal, with little or no thought given to 
meaning. In her poem “C-notes,” she simply 
lists words starting with the letter C that 
have completely disparate definitions but 
have some connection sonically, like “corners 
/ and coroners” or “caliphs / and calipers.” 
In other poems, she deftly connects ideas 
using similar consonant sounds, like “the 
rabbit / of the alphabet,” and internal rhyme, 
like “drops back / into the void / of the black 
hat.” This appreciation for sound hearkens 
back to the earliest days of poetry in the form 
of oral tradition, and it is often overlooked 
or considered as an afterthought by modern 
poets. One might even say Equi’s attention to 
sonic detail brings us back to the “good old 
days” of poetry, before technology got in the 
way, but that would be cliched and dismissive 
of the leaps and bounds we have made since 
then — a lesson that perhaps Equi herself could 
learn.

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
Cody White has only one 
message for Michigan State’s 
underclassmen this week.
“Going into this week, we 
know we have a mission to do 
and that’s to win the football 
game,” 
the 
wide 
receiver 
said Tuesday. “At any means 
possible, 
win 
the 
football 
game, so I feel like that’s what 
we’re gonna drive through 
every day in practice until the 
game day.” 
It’s safe to say the Spartans 
haven’t completed the mission 
they began the year with. At 
just four wins heading into 
the 112th meeting between 
Michigan and Michigan State, 
the Spartans are hoping for 
Saturday’s game to provide 
a spark to a season that’s 
vacillating between generally 
disappointing 
and 
outright 
dismal.
In 
the 
media 
room 
at 
Spartan Stadium on Tuesday, 
the Spartans made it clear that 
while this week is a chance 
to regroup from blowing a 
25-point lead to Illinois last 
Saturday, the bigger emphasis 
is on the chance to beat the 
team 60 miles down the road.
In the midst of what is 
shaping up to be, at best, a 
mediocre season for Michigan 
State, a win in the rivalry game 
and everything that comes with 
it would soften the blow for 
the players. Defensive tackle 
Raequan Williams referenced 
the emotion that comes with 
facing off in a hotly-contested 
matchup, and Williams and 
White both mentioned the 
extra edge that comes with 
this game.
“(Michigan State coach Mark 
Dantonio) always tries to tell 
us to keep the lion in the cage,” 
White 
said. 
“Everything’s 
going to be calmed down until 

game time, and then the lion’s 
going to just unleash itself.”
Added Williams: “This is 
the biggest game of the year. 
It’s the next one up and we 
didn’t have the season that we 
wanted, so this game will be a 
lot for us emotionally. You will 
see a lot of emotion for this 
game.”
For 
linebacker 
Antjuan 
Simmons, who went to high 
school across the street from 
Michigan Stadium at Pioneer, 
his first introduction to the 
intensity of preparation in 
rivalry week came in practice 
before his first game of the 
rivalry as a freshman in 2017.
“I think it was my first play,” 
Simmons said. “I got hit by an 
upperclassman — like whacked 
— and he’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s 
Michigan week!’ and I’m like, 
‘Alright, it’s Michigan week.’ … 
And then when I got out there 
in the game, it didn’t matter. 
Every player, it was nasty. It 
was a nasty game.”
But while the players went 
on about the extra emotion 
and the level of intensity that 
comes with Michigan week, 
Dantonio had little to say 
beyond the typical platitudes 
of rivalry week.

“Right now, for me, my main 
consideration is our football 
team and getting them down 
and 
football-game 
ready,” 
Dantonio said. “We’ve come 
and competed. We’ll compete. 
We’ll 
play 
hard. 
We 
just 
can’t make mistakes to beat 
ourselves.”
Taken 
out 
of 
context, 
Dantonio 
could 
be 
talking 
about 
any 
game 
on 
the 
Spartans’ schedule this year. 
He made a handful of more 
specific comments about the 
Wolverines, but the overall 
tone was one of a coach who 
mostly just wants to talk about 
the game, not everything else 
that goes along with it.
It was clear Dantonio didn’t 
feel the need to make a splashy 
statement that dominates the 
headlines 
leading 
into 
the 
game.
This 
iteration 
of 
the 
matchup brings a game with 
different stakes for each side, 
but the bottom line of what 
each team is truly playing for is 
the rivalry.
“This 
game 
means 
everything,” 
Williams 
said. 
“It depends on if you own 
Michigan or you don’t, so you 
gotta go out and win this one.”

EAST LANSING — Nearly 13 
minutes into a press conference 
three days after one of the most 
disastrous losses of his tenure 
as Michigan State’s coach and 
four days before a game that 
could put an exclamation mark 
on a season from hell, Mark 
Dantonio 
was 
asked 
about 
Larry Caper.
On the 10-year anniversary 
of Caper’s overtime run against 
Michigan, it was fitting. The 
picture of Caper bouncing off 
defenders and into the end 
zone, the 1-3 Spartans knocking 
off the undefeated Wolverines, 
beating them in consecutive 
years for the first time since 
1967, still sets a tone for this 
rivalry. It’s cast as a turning 
point, and with good reason — 
including that streak, Michigan 
has beaten Michigan State all of 
three times since 2008.
Dantonio spent a minute 
recalling details of the game, 
the Spartans blowing a 14-point 
lead, then recapturing it on with 
Caper’s run. Then Dantonio 
said this: “I think it’s good to 
have a little bit of history, but 
you gotta focus on the moment.”
That takes us to the next 
question. One about Dantonio’s 
future. One that brought the 
room 
rushing 
towards 
the 
present, 
where 
Dantonio’s 
Spartans are 4-5 just one year 
after they were 7-6 and three 
years after they were 3-9. 
Where they blew a 25-point 
first-half 
lead 
at 
home 
to 
Illinois last week, and where 
Dantonio’s hands moved to his 
pockets and his lips pursed as 
a reporter probed at whether 
he will still be in East Lansing 
next year.
He told a story about meeting 
with Michigan State’s freshmen 
on Monday. One of them asked 
how he handled the criticism 
that comes with his position.

“Hey, when you’re the head 
of the program, you’re the head 
of something big. And things 
don’t go as well, that person’s 
gonna be criticized,” Dantonio 
recalled saying. “And that’s part 
of it. 
“But what people need to 
understand out there is, I had 
as much information as I can 
to do the job that I’m doing and 
I’m gonna try to do it with your 
players in mind. We’re gonna 
work hard, we’re gonna always 
stay 
positive, 
we’re 
gonna 
rise above it. And that’s the 
only thing that I can do. I can 
continue to rise above it or I can 
take another direction and start 
to go below that. And I’m not 
gonna go that direction.”
This 
matters 
because 
Dantonio is about to lead his 
team into the biggest game of its 
season. And, perhaps more than 
any other point in his 13-year 
tenure 
as 
Michigan 
State’s 
coach, the Spartans’ season is 
tied into the result.
It would be hyperbolic and 
uninformed to say Dantonio’s 
job 
rides 
on 
Saturday’s 
outcome. But with his program 
stumbling 
on 
and 
off 
the 
field, with another headache 
on Tuesday when Dantonio 
said 
quarterback 
Brian 
Lewerke didn’t go through any 
concussion 
protocol 
before 
coming back into Saturday’s 
game after taking a hit to the 
head and with a $4.3 million 
retention bonus in Dantonio’s 
contract set to trigger in mid-
January, it’s not unfair to 
say a win over Michigan — a 
reminder of what Dantonio 
brought to Michigan State — 
would go a long way.
The 
Wolverines 
have 
a 
considerable talent advantage 
over the Spartans. The game is 
in Ann Arbor. Michigan opened 
as a 12-point favorite, and it 
feels like there is as much built-
in expectation that it should 
win this game as ever.

None of that stopped the 
usual platitudes from being 
uttered about the Michigan-
Michigan 
State 
rivalry 
on 
Tuesday underneath Spartan 
Stadium. They sounded just the 
same as in Schembechler Hall 
on Monday.
But, standing in contrast to a 
Michigan program that wants 
to at least cloak this week under 
the veil of normalcy, there was 
little masking how much this 
game means.
“I 
think 
everyone 
(puts 
more into this game),” Lewerke 
said. “Top to bottom. Coaches, 
players, 
the 
training 
staff, 
everyone. They’re trying to be 
something a little bit better and 
play a little bit better.”
“I knew that if we were gonna 
be successful here, ultimately, 
that we were gonna have to win 
down the road (in Ann Arbor) 
some, and here at home, and 
we were gonna have to measure 
up in every time we played that 
football game,” Dantonio said. 
“And so that’s what we put into 
effect. That we were gonna 
measure up in this football 
game.”
The need to measure up 
against Michigan has as much 
to do with Michigan State’s 
ethos, one that existed long 
before Dantonio and will exist 
long after, as it does with the 
program’s current situation. On 
Tuesday, the notion that this 
year’s game should be treated 
with more urgency because of 
the Spartans’ lackluster record 
was thrown out.
“This is one that, again, we 
need to measure up on and 
then we gotta let this one go,” 
Dantonio said. “And I’ve always 
tried to say, OK, what do we do 
after Michigan?”
Without an upset of the same 
variety Dantonio has pulled 
off before, though, he may not 
be the only one person around 
Michigan State asking that 
question after Saturday.

A

s practice wound down 
late Tuesday afternoon 
at Yost Ice Arena, Michi-
gan coach 
Mel Pearson 
gathered his 
players for 
the typical 
end-of-day 
huddle.
That 
huddle lasted 
longer than 
normal, 
though, as 
Pearson got 
his players more involved. He 
asked the group to discuss things 
they liked about the team, and 
comments ranged from work 
ethic and commitment to perse-
verance and defensive success.
It was a moment to pause and 
look within — a chance to reflect 
on the past and mentally prepare 
for what is to come.
An exchange of this sort fits 
the script of this Michigan hockey 
team (3-5-2 overall, 0-3-1-0 Big 
Ten). The Wolverines have strug-
gled to score consistently over the 
past two weekends, slipping into 
second to last in the conference 
standings.
Despite the tribulations, Pear-
son wants his squad to think 
about the positives. The common 
theme around the team is that bad 
breaks have been holding it back.
“Pucks are going to start fall-
ing in for us,” said senior forward 
Jake Slaker about the power play. 
“And I think that’s going to trans-
late to five-on-five, too. I think we 
are right there where things are 
going to start going our way.”
But that raises the following 
question: Is it realistic to expect a 
couple good bounces of the puck 
to fix the woes? To that, I’d argue 
yes. But the margin for error is 
slim, and the team must figure 
out how to play through obstacles 
beyond bounces.
First, it’s key to dissect Michi-
gan’s losses to see what exactly 
can be attributed to bad luck. The 
Wolverines’ tough stretch spans 
back to the 4-1 road loss against 
then-No. 18 Western Michigan. 
From then on, Michigan got 
swept by then-No. 13 Ohio State 
on the road, before tallying just 

one point in the recent home 
series against Minnesota.
Against the Broncos and Buck-
eyes, bad bounces were not the 
key issue. The Wolverines dug 
themselves into an early deficit 
in Kalamazoo and couldn’t climb 
back. And against Ohio State, the 
main issues were lackluster puck 
possession on offense, foolish 
penalties and a poor forecheck.
In the recent series, though, it’s 
fair to blame bad breaks. On Fri-
day, Michigan generated chances 
and outshot the Golden Gophers 
34-27 but didn’t get the breaks it 
needed to capitalize. 
That was true Saturday, too, 
only that the bad bounces extend-
ed to the defensive side as the 
Wolverines’ first two conceded 
goals involved a fair amount of 
poor luck. And that view is shared 
by outsiders, too. For instance, 
Michigan State coach Danton 
Cole — whose 
team is the 
Wolverines’ 
next opponent 
— mentioned 
Michigan’s 
struggles have 
to do with ‘puck 
luck.’
The underly-
ing trend is that 
despite the lack 
of scoring, the 
offense has made strides since the 
loss against Western Michigan. 
All the while, defense and goal-
tending have remained steady. 
If the offense continues to make 
strides and the defense remains 
stingy, then it’s logical that bet-
ter bounces could help this team 
unleash its potential.
Pearson is no stranger to 
early season struggles. In his 
first season at the helm, Michi-
gan fell two games under .500 
in January after getting swept 
by Notre Dame. Regardless, in 
those two contests he recog-
nized the potential of his team 
and knew it wasn’t too late. That 
group went on to make the Fro-
zen Four.
“And that’s similar to now,” 
Pearson said. “We’re doing some 
really good things. We played 
hard against Minnesota when 
the games on the line, we just 

couldn’t quite get that next goal, 
that next break, to make a dif-
ference.”
Better bounces likely will 
come for the Wolverines; in such 
a long season, there will always 
be some spurts of good luck.
Those might not come right 
away, though, and in the mean-
time Pearson doesn’t want 
to force things on the attack. 
He sees offense as a balance 
between urgency and poise, 
but understands that balance 
doesn’t come easy.
Given that there will be bad 
breaks during every season, 
Pearson is quick to say he would 
rather have them early on, as 
has been the case. There’s value 
in learning early how to play 
when things don’t go your way 
as this can pay dividends in the 
games that really matter.
“These tight games, these 
close games, 
aren’t a bad 
thing,” Pearson 
said. “You wanna 
win your share 
of them, but we 
will. Usually (in 
sports) it evens 
out at some point. 
We just have to 
make sure we 
stay with it. 
“We know 
where we wanna get to, it’s how 
we wanna get there. Right now 
we’re just making a little detour. 
It’s not the fastest way to where 
we wanna get to, but we’re on 
a detour, so we just got to man-
age the detour and find our way 
there.”
For Michigan to reach its des-
tination, it must follow through 
on the good bounces immedi-
ately when they come, because 
the team cannot afford to dig 
more of a hole. 
But the Wolverines must also 
learn to weather the storm when 
things go south. Luck doesn’t 
last forever, and the best teams 
know how to win even when 
bounces don’t go their way.
And if Michigan can figure 
this out, when the team gathers 
to culminate future practices the 
shared sentiments will be more 
profound.

Michigan’s length key to defense

The players on the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
shuffled off the court Sunday 
bearing 
smiles 
from 
their 
second blowout win of the 
weekend. Though the victories 
came against weak opponents 
— neither Western Michigan 
nor Bradley made the NCAA 
tournament 
last 
season 
— 
the 
Wolverines’ 
lockdown 
defensive performances earned 
them the right to celebrate, as 
they held both opponents under 
60 points.
For Michigan to achieve its 
goals of competing for a Big 
Ten championship and passing 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament, it will have to 
sustain this level of defense 
against 
tougher 
opponents. 
And the key to that lies in the 
Wolverines’ length. 
All five of Michigan’s starters 
this season measure in at 6-feet 
or taller, a rarity in women’s 
basketball. This kind of length 
means that players can more 
easily block shots and move 
into passing lanes to disrupt 
plays and intercept passes. 
“(Coach Kim Barnes Arico 
stresses) using the ability of our 

length,” said sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk. “Our starting lineup, 
we all have tremendous length, 
so just really focusing on 
keeping our hands up, sliding 
our feet and not fouling.”
Senior 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
seems poised to make more 
disruptive plays on defense this 
year. The 6-foot shooting guard 
recorded 27 steals coming off 
the bench last season. If she 
can continue to move quickly 
on defense, clog lanes and force 
opposing teams into mistakes, 
she can expect to pick up a 
few more steals from her new 
starting spot. 
“Our length is ridiculous this 
year for our starting lineup,” 
Johnson said. “It’s actually 
really crazy how many steals 
and deflections we get without 
even 
knowing 
that 
we’re 
getting them.”
A defense that can continue 
to pick up steals would help the 
Wolverines to improve off of a 
lackluster 2018-19 campaign, 
during which they allowed 63.6 
points per game — 148th in the 
country. 
Freshman 
center 
Izabel 
Varejão 
exemplifies 
how 
length can have an impact on 
the game, even with limited 
minutes. Standing at 6-foot-

4, she recorded four blocks in 
just 13 minutes against Bradley. 
While her height allows her to 
shut down opposing players in 
the post, she also has enough 
quickness and athleticism to 
defend guards on switches. 
At the same time, Michigan’s 
guards will need to lean on 
their length and quickness on 
switches as they face bigger 
and more athletic teams this 
season. If the Wolverines can 
rely on players like Johnson 
or Dilk to play sound defense 
against taller forwards, it will 
take pressure off of their own 
bigs allow them to comfortably 
make switches when defending 
the pick-and-roll. 
“We want to be able to … 
switch 
one 
through 
five,” 
Johnson said. “A lot of teams 
aren’t able to do that because 
their guards are little and they 
can’t guard a post, or their 
posts don’t have quick enough 
feet to guard guards, so I 
think that’s one thing that our 
team really has, is the ability 
to guard one through five on 
defense.”
The talent is there. This 
team is fully capable of playing 
defense at a high level, if they 
can play smart and use its 
length.

AN EVENING WITH SAFA AL AHMAD

NOVEMBER 19, 2019 | 7:30 P.M. | RACKHAM AUDITORIUM

FREE | NO REGISTRATION | WALLENBERG.UMICH.EDU

The Michigan basketball team 
knew its early-season matchup 
against Creighton would be telling.
In the wake of a program-
altering offseason that saw a head 
coaching change and the departure 
of three players that accounted for 
over half of the Wolverines’ offense 
last season, questions arose. On 
Tuesday night, Michigan (2-0) 
continued its search for answers 
in a 79-69 win against the Bluejays 
(1-1).
Those answers, as it turns out, 
are still a work in progress.
When first-year coach Juwan 
Howard was hired, it wasn’t a 
secret that the Wolverines were 
going to try their hand at an NBA 
brand of offense. As for what that 
means, exactly, Michigan has 
shown an emphasis on pushing the 
ball and generating 3-pointers thus 
far.
Against Creighton, not even 
Howard’s team’s overwhelming 
height 
advantage 
changed 
that approach. Thirteen of the 
Wolverines’ first 18 shots came 
from beyond the arc, a streak that 
culminated in senior point guard 
Zavier Simpson — a sub-30-percent 
career 3-point shooter — dropping 
his defender and draining a 
stepback triple.
In the early stages of the first 
half, Michigan looked like a well-
oiled machine. But when the well 
went dry, frustration mounted. 
The Bluejays pounced on the 
Wolverines’ miscues, closing the 
half on an 18-7 run en route to 
a 41-38 advantage at the break. 
For Michigan, poor rebounding 
and sloppy turnovers erased an 
otherwise positive opening few 
minutes.
By the end of the first half, the 
Wolverines had been outscored 
in the paint, 24-10, against a team 
with only one healthy player taller 
than 6-foot-8. Even with three 
rotational big men taller than that, 
Michigan’s first free throws came 
over 18 minutes into the game, as it 
seldom attacked the rim.
From the look of the halftime 
box score, you’d think Creighton 
had the upper-hand in height given 

its 23-10 rebounding advantage. 
Though 10 of those boards came on 
the offensive glass, Michigan only 
surrendered six second-chance 
points.
“We have to crack back and not 
allow those (opposing) bigs to run 
in freely to get offensive rebounds,” 
Howard said, “because I’m asking 
(Teske) to go after shots and alter 
shots and not allow guys just to 
walk down the lane and score 
layups. Now, the players have to do 
a better job covering up for him by 
blocking guys out on rebounds and 
not allowing guys to fly in and get 
extra possessions.”
With prized freshman wing 
Franz Wagner on the shelf due to 
a wrist fracture, the Wolverines 
didn’t know who would create 
offense on their own. A week after 
junior guard Eli Brooks posted 
a career-high 24 in the season-
opener and senior center Jon Teske 
chipped in 17, it was junior forward 
Isaiah Livers who answered the 
call against the Bluejays. He scored 
a career-high 22 points on 8-of-12 
shooting, while Simpson and Teske 
each added 17 of their own.
“(Livers) made some big shots 
for us,” Howard said. “He’s a super 
confident player. For his height, he 
does a really good job of getting 
elevation on his jump shot. … I 
think he’s done a fantastic job of 

embracing (his role) because with 
the confidence and as well as how 
we’re going to lean on him from an 
offensive end and defensive end.”
Coming out of halftime, the 
Wolverines took control of the 
game’s pace. Simpson finished 
a pair of transition layups that 
helped Michigan open the stanza 
on an 8-2 run, while the Wolverines 
only attempted seven second-half 
threes after shooting 16 in the first.
Backed by an effort to get the ball 
to the interior, Michigan ultimately 
built its 8-2 spurt into a crucial 
26-14 run and, most importantly, a 
lead it wouldn’t relinquish.
By the time the final buzzer 
sounded, 
the 
double-digit 
halftime deficit felt like a mere 
afterthought. And with Livers, 
Simpson and Teske combining 
for 56 of the Wolverines’ 79 points 
against a Big East defense, so did 
the offensive load of last year’s 
early departures.
Tuesday 
night 
was 
far 
from 
a 
season-defining 
win, 
and Michigan’s most pressing 
questions will remain unanswered 
for another month or so. But 
after narrowly avoiding a crisis 
against Appalachian State, the 
Wolverines’ performance against 
a 
respectable 
Bluejays 
team 
sure could be a springboard to 
immediate success.

On Tuesday, intentional or 
not, each half of basketball 
represented a different plan of 
attack — and with it, different 
identities 
of 
the 
Michigan 
men’s basketball team.
During a hard-fought 79-69 
win against Creighton (1-1 
overall), the Wolverines (2-0) 
used 
nearly 
every 
weapon 
they had in their arsenal, but 
switched its strategy as the 
game carried on.
In the first half, the 3-point 
shot was the saving grace for 
the offense.
To kick things off against 
the Bluejays, Michigan let 
it fly early and often. The 
Wolverines went 7-for-16 from 
deep throughout the half and 
were not shy about announcing 
their plan of attack. Leading 
this offensive barrage from 
3-point 
land 
was 
junior 
forward Isaiah Livers who hit 
four from downtown, three in 
the first half alone and finished 
the night with a career-high 22 
points.
Whether it was in transition 
or a product of senior guard 
Zavier Simpson driving to 
the hoop and finding an open 

man in the corner, the 3-point 
shot 
was 
instrumental 
to 
Michigan’s offense in the first 
half — closing out the first 20 
minutes down, 38-41.
The first half was also 
characterized 
by 
clean 
basketball. 
The 
Wolverines 
fouled just three times and 
turned the ball over on four 
occasions — a trend that would 
largely carry the whole game 
with Michigan committing just 
seven fouls and 11 turnovers 
all game. This play represents 
a 
marked 
departure 
from 
its season opener where the 
Wolverines handed the ball to 
their opponents 17 times.
In the second half, play from 
the big men dominated.
The hot hands would cool 
down in the final 20 minutes in 
favor of Michigan’s clear size 
advantage. In the second half, 
the Wolverines attempted as 
many threes as they made in 
the first.
With the change in attack 
brought 
more 
deliberate 
possessions. The guards fed 
senior center Jon Teske in the 
post who led the team with 
12 points and finished the 
night with 17. Further shaping 
this 
tact, 
Simpson 
found 
success near the basket due to 
relentless drives to the hoop 
and an unmatched ability to 
finish.
Now, there is just one simple 
question to answer: Was this 
strategy intentional?
The 
answer, 
almost 
certainly, is no.
It is hard to question the 
idea that Michigan wanted to 
control the post early against 
the Bluejays — a team who only 
had one player over 6-foot-8. 
While 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
may 
feed 
lines about how the team is 
always looking for the best 
shot and that the open man is 
going to dictate that offensive 
possession, 
in 
the 
context 
of this game, it’s not always 
applicable. Take this one, for 
example.
“We always try to get the 
best shot possible whether 

it’s the first or second half,” 
Howard said. “Overall, we 
want to make sure that we 
establish a balanced basketball 
game so that we can compete.”
The Wolverines were able 
to find that balance — and 
their ideal shot selection — 
in the second half due to the 
re-establishment of its big 
men, the change of fortune for 
50/50 balls and an increased 
defensive intensity. 
In 
the 
game, 
Creighton 
outscored Michigan on second 
chance points, 13-4, with most 
of these looks coming in the 
first 20 minutes. At the break, 
the emphasis from Howard 
pointed to transition defense 
and two tenants of play down 
low — offensive rebounding 
and defense around the basket.
“We got backdoored a lot,” 
Livers said. “I got backdoored 
once, (junior guard Eli Brooks) 
got once, (sophomore guard 
David DeJulius) once, and 
it’s just small plays like that 
for an easy two is gonna be 
troublesome because I feel like 
we’re gonna be like, ‘Damn, we 
just got a stop, we forgot about 
the backdoor.’ It was just the 
little things we gotta clean up.” 
Perhaps in a different game 
against a different team, these 
lapses on the defensive end 
cost Michigan the game. 
In this instance, though, the 
Wolverines were lucky that 
shots were falling from deep 
or else they would have been 
staring down a much larger 
deficit. 
But when it comes down 
to figuring out what changed 
at the half-way point in the 
contest, Livers claims that it all 
comes down to remembering 
what this team is all about.
“We kinda just treated it 
like it was practice,” Livers 
said. “Our scout team did a 
tremendous job all week of 
running their offense, and I 
guess we were overthinking it 
in the first half. Just things you 
do in basketball, and you come 
together and get that speech 
from coach Howard, things are 
gonna come out clicking.”

Test passed

Michigan runs away from Creighton late, tops Bluejays 79-69 behind career night from Livers, moving to 2-0

For in-state players, MSU rivalry 
game is friend against friend

In this state, Michigan and 
Michigan 
State 
football 
are 
religions. Their annual matchup 
is like a holy war. And local 
players were baptized in it early, 
sometimes from birth.
Nearly every football fan in 
the state bleeds either green and 
white or maize and blue. Many 
high school players imagine 
themselves in Ann Arbor or 
East Lansing, making plays that 
will eventually appear on the 
ever-expanding highlight reel of 
rivalry moments.
And then, when it’s time to 
head off to college, the rivalry 
inevitably 
becomes 
more 
personal. Some players become 
Wolverines. 
Others 
become 
Spartans.
Once a year, those players see 
each other again — the eyes of an 
entire state on them.
“This is a great game for 
me cause I’m from the state of 
Michigan,” said junior defensive 
back 
Ambry 
Thomas, 
who 
attended Martin Luther King 
High in Detroit, the same school 
as Michigan State linebacker 
Tyriq Thompson. “I know a lot of 
their players.”
Senior 
guard 
Michael 
Onwenu 
attended 
Detroit’s 
Cass Technical, the same high 
school 
as 
fellow 
Michigan 
players Donovan Peoples-Jones 
and Jaylen Kelly-Powell. Two 
Spartans went there as well, and 
Onwenu knows others on the 
roster from camps or high school 
rivalries.
For Onwenu, it’s easy to 
separate his friendships off the 
field with his enemies on the 
field. As soon as anyone puts on a 
Michigan State uniform, they’re 
just another foe to vanquish. But 
games against familiar faces add 
another layer to the matchup.

“If it’s people you know 
personally, it kinda goes for 
you,” Onwenu said. “Because you 
might know their tells or know 
their tendencies even better.”
Peoples-Jones, 
also 
an 
alumnus of Cass Tech, was close 
with Spartan defensive back 
Kalon Gervin in high school but 
said Tuesday the two haven’t 
spoken 
ahead 
of 
Saturday’s 
matchup. Sophomore defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson — who 
attended Divine Child High 
School in Dearborn, Mich. — has 
the opposite approach.
Hutchinson, one of the loudest 
and brashest players on the 
team, doesn’t shy away from 
the chippier aspects of “Hate 
Week,” and that includes lots 
of trash talk. Michigan State 
backup quarterback Theo Day 
also attended Divine Child and is 
one of Hutchinson’s best friends. 
And while Hutchinson listened 
to Day air his frustrations about 
the Spartans’ collapse against 
Illinois, he also made it known 
that come Saturday, he’d show no 
mercy.
“I don’t know if I can tell 
you what he said, but some 
words were said between us,” 

Hutchinson 
said. 
“He 
was 
talking a little bit about the game, 
but yeah, I’m just pumped to play 
him.”
When 
you 
consider 
the 
connections that lie in every 
corner 
of 
this 
rivalry, 
it’s 
no 
surprise 
that 
Michigan-
Michigan State is known as one 
of the ugliest matchups in college 
football. As much as both teams 
sometimes downplay it — with 
Onwenu referring to the Spartans 
as “another team on the schedule 
we’ve gotta beat” — those born 
and bred on either side know this 
is much more than that.
For players throughout the 
state who grew up devout in this 
rivalry, whose lives are ingrained 
in this rivalry, this is their holy 
grail.
“Owning the state of Michigan 
is always a big thing for the two 
programs who battle for it every 
single year,” said senior guard 
Ben Bredeson. “There’s the Paul 
Bunyan Trophy involved as well. 
There’s a lot of pride that goes 
into it as well for the fanbases. 
It’s a cool rivalry just because 
you have the in-state factor of it 
and you get bragging rights for 
the year.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 13, 2019

I

t was a typical Oxford Monday 
morning. I was sitting in my favor-
ite coffee shop sipping my Ameri-
cano, when a man with a giant cowboy hat 
walked in. He was dressed in a dashing 
suit jacket paired up with bootcut jeans, 
pointy leather boots and round sunglass-
es. It was distinctive, but curious style — 
a combination of mod and cowboy. I was 
sure that he was already accustomed to 
attention, evidenced by how he would 
automatically ignore anyone’s stare. But as 
my eyes were following his hat around, he 
caught my gaze and smiled back.
His smile was effortlessly beautiful. The 
man seemed unworried about rent, gro-
ceries or working overtime. I was imme-
diately struck. Having been working days 
and nights on the 2,000-word philosophy 
essay in front of me, I had nothing but 
exhaustion on my face. With that effort-
less action, the man with a giant cowboy 
hat helped me let go of my annoyances for 
a while.
I remained static in my seat, and couldn’t 
help but start reflecting on this simple, yet 
miraculous interaction. Smiling at strang-
ers? I hated even making eye contact with 
them. It’s automatic, almost precognitive, 
how I’d gaze elsewhere after only millisec-
onds of staring. People’s responses to my 
eye contact drive me crazy: They look back 
at you with their wrinkled eyebrows and 
frowning lips, as if you’re the reason for 
their bad mood. I might be overthinking, 
but nevertheless, their reactions impact 
my good mood. Truthfully, I’d prefer star-
ing at the pavement. Not only does it help 
to avoid tripping, but also prevents anyone 
from turning me into a frazzled, introvert-
ed mess. 
On my way back home from the coffee 
shop, I paid attention to every person walk-
ing past me. It was December. Everybody 
spends their calories keeping themselves 
warm. People buried their faces in their 
scarves, focused on the song blasting in 
their AirPods. Winter increases efficiency 
– it’s always one destination straight to the 
next. That man’s smile, however, punched 
everyone who only wanted to move quick-
ly in the face (including me). It was simply 
infectious. I should be able to smile like 

that and lift up someone else’s spirit in a 
snap of a finger. 
So I prescribed myself a mission: mas-
ter the art of smiling. Having been accus-
tomed to staring at the bricks on the 
pavement, it was quite hard to lift my 
head up. In the cold December of Oxford, 
the wind was fierce. My eyes, sensitive as 
they are, started to get watery. I started 
out my mission with some easy targets: 
grandmas. They walked slowly, leaving a 
good amount of time for them to realize 
my gaze. Then I moved to young girls, but 
avoiding the ones who seemed to me like 
drama queens. From there, I started to 
gaze upon every person that walked pass 
by — the sharp dressed middle-aged man, 
the backpack dude with giant headphones 
and the exhausted mom with a stroller. 
The wind was still blowing, and my dis-
appointment was piling up — every single 
person looked away immediately when our 

eyes met.
Just as I stood on the edge of giving up, 
there was one exception.
On the narrow Oxford pavement, a 
man with a beautiful German shep-
herd by his side was walking towards 
me, together in their healthy, fast-paced 
steps. He seemed quite friendly. “Last 
one of today,” I spoke to myself. I looked 
into his eyes and smiled. Unfortunately, 
an amusing scene occurred: a strong 
wind suddenly swept through, and my 
hair flew all over my face. But in between 
strands of my hair, the whooshing of the 
wind, and my embarrassment, I saw a 
huge smile and heard the word “Hello!” 
from him. At the moment, this most com-
monly-used word in the world sounded 
more beautiful than any song on my iPod. 
The wind didn’t slow down its pace, nor 
did the man and his dog. But the sound of 
‘hello’ lingered in the air. There it was — 

the genuineness that occurred easily and 
truthfully between two strangers. Noth-
ing can sabotage the beauty, not even the 
most terrible, windy English weather.
On my way back home, something 
familiar suddenly leaped into my eyes – 
the cowboy hat! That man, in his usual 
suits, boots and sunglasses, was standing 
on the high steps of his hair salon. The 
salon is located at a busy crossroad. He 
has the perfect spot to watch the busy, 
fast 
paced, 
mind-their-own-business 
pedestrians. It was peculiar of him to 
stand outside on such a windy day, despite 
how fun people-watching can be. But 
that was the least of my concern, since 
it offered me a perfect opportunity. The 
wind — since I was walking in the oppo-
site direction — swept all the messy hair 
away from my face. Everything seemed to 
work in my favor.
It was my chance to light up his day.

I 

didn’t get to know Elixir Vitae Coffee and Tea 
until it was almost too late.
In the Ann Arbor coffee shop scene, Elixir 
Vitae is an outlier. Maybe it’s the location, tucked 
away on Maynard Street, a part of Ann Arbor that 
only gets frequented by student traffic on Saturday 
nights when the Scorekeepers line stretches into the 
parking garage. Or the storefront, unassuming and 
almost drab. But it’s something else, too — it feels like 
you have to be invited to step foot in Elixir for the first 
time. It’s not a place you just happen into by accident.
It’s difficult to conceptualize what exactly sets 
Elixir apart. Maybe it’s the haphazard swirls and eyes 
painted on the wall or the long-haired barista more 
often than not found lounging out front smoking his 
cigarette. Or maybe it’s the bathroom, covered in 
hand-scrawled poetry, calls to activism, professions 
of love and quips on the futility of existence. Elixir is a 
conscious response to its Ann Arbor coffee shop peers 
claiming to be alternative, quirky and counter-culture 
with their mismatched furniture, racks of minimalist 
greeting cards and $6 oat milk lattes. 
Elixir is not a $6 oat milk latte coffee shop. Elixir is 
a $2 local brew coffee shop.
I only found Elixir Vitae earlier this semester — my 
senior year at the University of Michigan, after having 
already lived in this city for three years. My first visit 
was by invitation, of course. A friend was meeting 
another friend there, and I was generously permitted 
to tag along.
In those few short months since my introduction 
to Elixir, I’ve fallen hard. It’s a fixture of my daily 
routine now, a reflex — a given destination rather than 
a conscious decision. Most days, I’ll set up shop at one 
of the tables by the window with my mug of Roos 
Roast Lobster Butter Love coffee, and hammer out 
an essay, some emails, whatever’s on the list for the 
day. It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard for me to 
get certain tasks done if I’m not at Elixir, like writing 
pretty much anything that’s not a dry response paper. 
Something about the overall aura gets the creative 
juices flowing in a manner the Ugli could never — the 
majority of this column, for example, was written at 
the window table closest to the door. It’s objectively 
best table in Elixir — unobstructed view of street 
traffic for people-watching breaks and right next to 
the outlet.
How did I let Elixir take me over so completely, so 
quickly?
I think my sudden, all-consuming attachment to 
Elixir is due in large part to being a senior. I have a few 
months left in Ann Arbor, and then my undergraduate 
career will be over — done, finished.
Elixir is the kind of place that my ideally constructed 
college student — the Rory Gilmore that high school 
Meghann strived to be — would have spent all her 
time. This character would be casually artistic and 
creative in all the right ways, a person thoroughly 
engaged in activism and changing the world, 
constantly surrounded by huge circles of inspiring 
and high-achieving friends.
And I don’t feel like that person — at least not in the 
way that my naïve, high school self imagined I would 
be. 

I 
have 
wonderful 
friends. 
I’m 
involved 
in 
organizations that feel relevant and inspiring. I 
do recognize that I’ve grown immensely from the 
person I was when I got to Michigan. I have a much 
better sense of self, of what I like and who I want to 
be around, and I’m proud of the person I am now — I 
truly am. 
But I don’t feel like I’ve achieved all the goals out 
there, grown in all the possible ways, become that 
elusive accomplished, worldly college student that 
I was supposed to be by now, in my final year of 
undergrad — even if that student is, and always was, 
nothing but a construct pieced together from books 
and TV shows and my academic parents’ dinner table 
conversations growing up.
It’s hard to shake the sense that it’s too late. I’m 
trying to grasp at all the straws that will make me 
that person in my last couple semesters living in Ann 
Arbor and doing the college thing. Spending all my 
time at Elixir Vitae, prioritizing time with friends 
that inspire me and make me laugh, writing (this 
column), playing my guitar more often. 
I’m well aware that it’s absurdly unrealistic to 
expect that of myself, to live up to some ideal 
of what I think the perfect college student 
should be — after all, aren’t we all just constant 
works in progress? Isn’t that what every self-
help book/motivational speaker/therapist ever 
has said, over and over? But that doesn’t make it 
any less difficult for me to accept that I haven’t 
done everything that I wanted to in college — 
and college is ending in only a few short months. 
And when it does, there will be club meetings 
I never went to, stories I never wrote, 
friendships that were never deepened 
past superficial hello’s. 
So I’m clinging to Elixir for 
the moment, and any semblance 
of idealized identity I have 
attached to it. Keeping in mind 
that my days spent between 
these electric teal walls are 
numbered, and trying not to 
think too much about what 
will happen when those days 
inevitably run out.
But am I allowed to be upset 
about my time with this coffee 
shop coming to an end? Can I 
claim Elixir for my own, claim 
whatever passing fling we’ve had 
over the past couple months as an 
affair serious enough to warrant 
the overwhelming sadness I feel for 
leaving its comforts? 
In the end, all I can say is that I hope 
students continue to embrace 
Elixir — even after I’ve 
gone, 
despite 
the 
reflexive 
twinge 
of 
jealousy 
that 
accompanies 
the realization 

that I’ll have to relinquish my space to a new 
generation. I hope a new wave of college students 
manage to spend their formative years sitting around 
these tables, talking about socialism and climate 
change — spending their whole college experience 
having those conversations and being those people, 
not just their senior year.
And maybe it wouldn’t make a difference. Maybe 
this new wave of Elixir devotees would leave college 
feeling just as disillusioned as I’m currently feeling, 
struggling with at once recognizing how transformed 
they’ve become over the past four years and being 
terrified that there’s only so much time left for that 
change to continue happening.
But I’d like Elixir to be there for them, anyway.

T

he old adage goes, “You eat with your eyes first.” 
This happened to be the case for my mom when 
she skimmed the Food Network magazine and 
discovered a picture of cookies that looked irresistible. With 
gooey chocolate chunks and crunchy oat flakes, they were 
worthy of a “phone eats first” Instagram post. She immediately 
turned the page for the recipe, which read “Vegan Cowgirl 
Cookies.” Vegan. She didn’t even know what that meant, but 
she was curious about vegan baking and compelled to try this 
recipe. After sampling her final results, she decided that they 
tasted “legit.”
Before “Vegan Cowgirl Cookies,” I hadn’t given the 
legitimacy of veganism or plant-based diets much thought. 
When my second grade gym teacher reviewed the food 
pyramid and taught us the importance of a balanced diet, 
including the staples of meat, dairy, grains etc, the word vegan 
wasn’t mentioned once. 
Upon hearing someone call themselves vegan, my knowledge 
of the colored food pyramid grounded my initial impression: a 
vegan diet was a flawed nutritional lifestyle. I was under the 
impression that a strong sentiment for animal rights was the 
only thing that drove people to become vegan. 
When my younger sister, Tatum, returned home from her 
freshman year at Columbia University and declared she was 
vegan, I watched her choose not to consume any meat or 
animal products (poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, gelatin) or 
even purchase any animal byproducts, such as leather clothing.
Slight chaos ensued in our household thereafter. Tatum’s 

vegan options took up too much space in the freezer and 
she’d inconveniently make her own meals concurrent with 
my mom’s dinner preparations, leaving a mess in the kitchen. 
At the family dinner table, my other sister Geena, an avid, 
unapologetic steak lover, would comically fight with Tatum 
over their respective food choices. As for me, I was confused 
why Tatum would eat all these “imitation,” or alternative 
products — all of which contained ingredients that seemed so 
fake, unnatural and unhealthy. 
Nothing was more complicated than deciding what 
restaurant to eat at as a family. Even though Tatum vowed she 
could find something to eat on any menu, we’d still cater our 
restaurant choice to meet her dietary restrictions. One could 
say veganism caused some beef in the Meyhoefer household.
Despite our mealtime dilemmas and the occasional joke, 
our family was respectful and accommodating of Tatum’s 
lifestyle choices but it still took us a while before completely 
understanding the reasoning behind them. To be fair, Tatum 
didn’t want to cause any inconvenience: She didn’t want to 
act arrogantly about her view or appear high maintenance, 
conscious of the way some vegans are perceived in society. 
At one point, Tatum explained how she physically felt better 
based on what she was eating. The logic of that reasoning for 
a vegan lifestyle piqued my attention and made me think how 
the ethical sense of veganism merges with the physical sense. 
Tatum mentioned how she now has more energy after meals as 
well as how she is less stressed in regards to what she eats, since 
it is now in line with her beliefs. Eating clean isn’t necessarily 

the same as eating healthy.
The inner “foodie” in me is 
always excited by the opportunity 
to try new foods and restaurants, 
so I adjusted to my rationale on 
what I thought was restrictive 
about veganism and embraced the 
possibility of the new foods I could 
expose myself to and now include 
in my diet. With an academic’s 
mind and adventurous spirit — I 
hit the books and went grocery 
shopping.
After scouring a multitude of 
websites on the internet, I began 
to unravel the layers of veganism. 
Someone’s reasoning for living a 
vegan lifestyle could range from 
ethical, to religious, to health, 
to sustainability reasons. I was 
primarily drawn to the subset of environmental veganism; 
I was astonished by the environmental implications of a 
plant-based diet, especially with the recent devastation 
of the Amazon. In alignment with that revelation, studies 
have revealed correlations between raising animals and the 
exertion of resources such as water, land and greenhouse 
gases. Some studies go even further, claiming a vegan diet is 
“essential” to avoid climate change. My research also yielded 
information on how large of a spectrum veganism is in regards 
to the environmental impact of meat and dairy production. 
Veganism is nuanced in this way, since no two vegan lifestyles 
look the same. The term “vegan” is nebulous, and the intensity 
of a vegan lifestyle may vary given it is an individual decision. 
Honey, for instance, is contentiously debated among vegans as 
to whether or not it should be avoided.
Whether or not I chose to eat vegan at a particular meal, 
I became intrigued by the ingredients of what I consumed 
and where they were being sourced. To me, veganism is 
substantiated on the knowledge of where and how products are 
sourced, rather than a list of what one can and cannot consume. 
I’m reminded of the chickens in my friend’s backyard, whose 
eggs would not technically fit into the plant-based category yet 
are ethically sourced and humanely harvested. Alternatively, a 
product such as coffee, which is undeniably plant-based, could 
be deemed unethical when grown on deforested rainforests 
that emit higher greenhouse gases compared to coffee grown 

on suitable land under sustainable practices.
Veganism isn’t all salads and tofu. With the rise of plant-
based alternatives, including Beyond Meat and Daiya “cheese,” 
it’s easy to assume veganism is merely a trend. However, a 
closer look at the history of veganism reveals otherwise. Diets 
like veganism have ties back to over 2,000 years ago in eastern 
Mediterranean and ancient Indian societies, who resorted to 
plant-based food for religious and philosophical intentions. 
The term “vegetarian” was later coined in the mid-1800s and 
in November 1944, Donald Watson established the Vegan 
Society, in which an early definition of modern veganism 
originated. The definition has since been slightly modified and 
eventually grew into how veganism is thought of today. 
Inevitably with my deepened understanding of veganism, 
when returning to campus in September for my senior year, 
one of my first stops was The Lunch Room, a popular vegan 
spot in Ann Arbor. As I was enjoying every bite of my vegan 
pad thai, I couldn’t help but take in the atmosphere and 
overhear the conversations around me. Their welcoming staff 
seemed to attract all demographics and the tables were filled 
with families, students, first dates and old friends catching up. 
Comments on the food casually slipped into the conversation, 
whether it was simply on how tasty the food was or how they 
couldn’t believe the mac and “cheese” was vegan. And, of 
course, I caught others taking pictures of their food, myself 
guilty of doing so too. 
Phillis Engelbert and Joel Panozzo, co-owners of The Lunch 
Room and Detroit Filling Station restaurants, epitomize the 
unifying dynamic of veganism in the hospitality industry. 
“The restaurant is sort of a combination of vegan diet and 
cooking, plus community organizing, plus liking to plan and 
have parties,” Engelbert said. When describing the extensive 
range of people the restaurant entertains, quite literally with 
live music events, Engelbert added, “Vegans are probably a 
small minority of our customer base.”
As much as I agree and support such a lifestyle that leaves 
a greener footprint, I am still perplexed by how veganism fits 
into other narratives of society. Food is a language of its own; 
food speaks to us when we don’t know what to say. Similar 
to how some cultures or religions refrain from meat, specific 
foods are expected in the traditions of other cultures. In my 
Italian background at least, Thanksgiving isn’t complete until 
Grandma Francine’s meatballs and mostaccioli are on the 
table. 
Also on the issue of a vegan lifestyle, I’m an advocate for 
listening to one’s own body — even if that encompasses the 

need to consume non-vegan foods or products. For instance, 
certain individuals have blood types that recommend a higher 
meat or dairy intake. Additionally, most vegan alternatives rely 
heavily on soy ingredients. In that case, for individuals with soy 
or gluten allergies and medical conditions, a completely vegan 
diet may not be realistic. Veganism also brings up questions 
of accessibility to everyone on the basis of food inequalities. 
Especially in today’s society of “diet culture” and the “wellness 
industry” there is also an underlying pressure to make food 
decisions not based on biological instincts, but rather through 
guilt based on what people eat or don’t eat.
So where does this leave me now? Vegan? Flexitarian? 
Pescetarian? Non-vegan? “Naughty” vegan? In all honesty, 
I’m not sure. But, I like knowing that I can make a 
marginal environmental impact with some of my efforts to 
reduce meat and dairy intake. I find satisfaction in opting 
for vegan alternatives, especially with today’s luxuries of 
so many options, even in the milk aisle alone. However, 
given the multi-dimensionality to veganism, there doesn’t 
need to be any identities or labels assigned to it that would 
continue to perpetuate 
stigmas and divisiveness. 
I suppose I’m taking 
a stance on no stance; I 
may sound hypocritical 
as a non-vegan in support 
of veganism, but I like 
to think my awareness 
counts for something. 
I’m 
still 
hungry 
for 
knowledge, 
though, 
and when it comes to 
learning, one can never 
be overly satiated. 
But really, who am I to 
tell anyone what to do or 
eat or not eat? I realize 
not everyone will be 
stocking their freezers 
with veggie burgers and 
Ben and Jerry’s vegan ice 
cream after reading this, 
but I like to hope there’s 
some take away from 
my 
own 
meandering 

conclusions about veganism – even if it’s one less eye roll 
upon the mention of someone saying they’re vegan. 
Or it could be an open door to another way of thinking 
about sustainability efforts; such as, but not confined to, 
limiting one’s single-use plastics, cleaning the beaches of 
trash, planting a tree, composting or simply remembering 
to turn off the light when leaving a room. Sustainability 
looks different for everyone, but regardless of what one 
brings to the table it all makes a difference. 
By the end of the summer, my family learned how to 
agree to disagree. We visited vegan-only restaurants 
as well as steak restaurants that included a tasty vegan 
alternative on their menus. If Geena and Tatum can get 
along over veganism, and if restaurants like the Detroit 
Filling Station can find success in their communities, I 
think veganism can be more unifying than people imagine. 
And whether you’ve labeled yourself vegan, not vegan, 
somewhere or nowhere in between, my mom’s vegan 
cookies are incontestably a favorite. So, I leave you with 
some food for thought:

T

he day after Thanksgiving my 
senior year of high school, I board-
ed a 15-hour flight from San Fran-
cisco to Sydney, Australia. On my shoulder I 
carried a pink Adidas sports bag with eight 
carefully folded leotards, four pairs of satin 
pointe shoes, and a metal container full of 
bobby pins. In my left hand I held the top of 
a suit bag — borrowed from my dad — where 
I’d hung a sparkling white costume dress that 
would inevitably shed glitter everywhere. 
Around me, passengers shoved duffel bags 
into overhead bins as they squeezed into their 
spots for the impending journey. 
I remember looking around the plane and 
wondering what everyone’s story was. I won-
dered if anyone else was on their way to fulfill 
a lifelong dream. Had anyone else spent their 
childhood inside a ballet studio? I wiggled my 
toes in my sneakers. The edge of a bruised toe-
nail — collateral damage from a pointe shoe 
earlier that week — twinged in pain. I ignored 
it. I was too excited. 
I was on my way to the Geneé International 
Ballet Competition, an event which served as 
the capstone of my 16-year-long relationship 
with classical ballet. 
My mom started me in ballet shortly after 
my third birthday. I don’t remember asking 
her for lessons nor do I recall falling in love 
after my first trip to the studio. But over the 
course of the following decade, ballet would 
become my closest friend. I spent hours in 
the studio learning how to mold my grow-
ing body into the shapes, positions and lines 
required of classical technique. I fell in love 
with leotards and drooled over satin shoes. I 
learned how to make my hair into a bun that 
would stay back even during the fastest turns. 
I sacrificed sleepovers and sports games to 
perfect my pointed feet. The exacting nature 
of classical technique fed my eager work ethic 
unlike anything else my young self knew, and 
the focus it required gave me direction when 
I didn’t know where else to look. 
Despite that direction, I knew from an 
early age that I wasn’t going to be a profes-
sional ballerina. I was too tall and I wanted 
to go to college – two barriers in the world of 
classical ballet. This decision, however, did 
not stop me from wanting to get as close as I 
possibly could to those professional dreams. 
The Geneé is a competition sponsored by the 
Royal Academy of Dance, designed for the 
best ballet students across the globe. I was a 
sophomore in high school when I decided I 
had a shot. It would be over a year until I even 
qualified. The day that I found out, I sat in the 
car next to my brother and cried ugly tears of 
joy. 
Today, the pictures I have of me onstage 
seem like they come from a dream. Dressed 

in a simple leotard and tights with the num-
ber 54 pinned to my front, I am a facade of 
clam set against an imposing black stage. My 
face hides its nerves behind an expression 
of rehearsed serenity and a layer of heavy 
makeup that I’d applied in an underground 
dressing room. When I came offstage after 
my second solo, there was an email waiting 
for me from one of my teachers telling me how 
proud she was. Her kind words were reward 
enough for me. 
As we boarded the bus back to the hotel 
the last night, all 80 of us began to sing “Let it 
Go” from “Frozen.” Even the girls who didn’t 
speak English knew the words. We smiled 
and laughed and screamed the words in uni-
son. Many of my new acquaintances had been 
offered scholarships to professional-track 
academies and others would go on to be danc-
ers at world-renowned companies. The level 
of talent in that vehicle was unimaginable, but 
for that short moment we all existed together 
in one crazy obsession with a children’s song. 
 
My flight back to the U.S. was delayed, 
and by the time the wheels hit the ground I 
was ready to crawl into bed and sleep for a 
long time. When I woke up, I let it all set in: 
the competition, the training, the lifetime of 
hours. I’d accomplished my goal, so when I 
graduated high school the following spring, I 
put my leotards in a box at the bottom of my 
closet.
After almost two decades of tunnel-
visioned dedication, I freed myself for other 
things. Ballet could be one of them, but it 
wasn’t going to be the only one. 
In this spirit, I darted in and out of the bal-
let classes I could find in college. But the fur-
ther removed I became from my time onstage 
at Geneé, the more my muscles began to for-
get their training. The strength and control 
I’d once maintained through hours of daily 
classes began to dissolve. When I looked in 
the mirror at the front of the ballet studio, I 
saw only a shadow of the dancer I used to be. 
Ballet class became something to fear. 
What would upset me today? Which body part 
would fail me? Would this leotard still look as 
good as it used to? I allowed the voice in the 
back of my head to tell me that my changing 
body was a representation of failure — that 
my decreasing flexibility was a sign of my own 
lack of discipline. Ballet is a visual art. I spent 
years learning how to move my body in order 
to make the unnatural look natural. As my 
strength atrophied, I no longer looked like the 
sum of that knowledge. Brick by emotionally-
taxing brick, I built a wall between body and 
mind that left me blind on where to turn next. 
Last summer I caught in the midst of one 
of these arguments, upset with myself over 
my decreasing range of motion, I decided I 

needed a new coping mechanism. Fighting 
dancing with dancing wasn’t cutting it any-
more and the mirror wasn’t getting any nicer. 
I sat on my bed with my computer and 
thought about all the balletic knowledge I’d 
gained in the last two decades. I wondered if I 
would ever find a use for it. 
On a whim, I started to write. My fingers 
clicked across the loud laptop keyboard as I 
wrote about my favorite steps and the secrets 
I knew about them. I explained why certain 
things look easy but are actually hard and I 
wrote about the dance history I’d learned 
from years of watching grainy YouTube 
videos of famous stars from decades 
ago. I explained why I loved my favor-
ite ballets (Swan Lake, anyone?) and I 
tried to articulate what made them so 
important. 
Before starting to write, I had 
never given myself the authority to 
embrace all that knowledge, tell-
ing myself that I had to have 
made it professionally to 
have some sort of opin-
ion. When it dawned on 
me that this was stupid, I 
basked in the confidence I 
got in return. As I strung 
words together on a page, 
I became free of the physi-
cal limitations of my body. 
On paper, I was as malleable 
and flexible and strong as I 
wished I could be in the 
mirror. I was free to move 
— to fly — without chal-
lenge or pain. 
Upon making this dis-
covery, I have since sat 
on couches and coffee 
shops, sometimes at 
odd hours of the night, 
figuring out how to 
tell others why all 
this means so much 
to me. And as I slowly 
explain to the world 
what I love about bal-
let, I remind the voice 
in the back of my head 
that she loves it too. 
The system is not perfect. 
The mirror still isn’t always kind and the 
writing doesn’t always flow (writing this 
piece, in fact, involved a substantial amount 
of pacing and complaining). Despite the occa-
sional curse word muttered under my breath, 
however, this intermingling of expression 
— of writing and of dancing — gives me the 
peace of mind that allows me to do both with 
pride.

T

here is a bar in Berlin, hidden 
in one of my favorite neighbor-
hoods, that I would have over-
looked if someone had not pointed it out 
to me. The lighting was dim, not because 
the owners were trying to set a mood, but 
because the bar had no lights. The chairs 
all looked like they had come from dump-
ster diving adventures. It was always 
crowded, and it reeked of tobacco. The 
only thing noteworthy, was a blue neon 
sign, that in English read “I lie that I am 
an artist.” 
I remember chuckling as I read the 
sign out loud. But for me, the phrase 
would be, “I lie that I am a writer.” I say 
that I am a writer, but this phrase does 
not roll off my tongue with ease. It feels 
like a lie because still, something deep 
within me has not come to terms with 
the title: writer. I do not feel like I have 
earned the right to call myself a writer. 
I had multiple journals as a child. I 
wrote in the margins of my school books. 
I have a box full of sticky notes with ideas 
of things I want to write. I wrote dur-
ing class and on my commute to school. I 
write long letters to my friends. But even 
so, I have never felt like a writer. 

Am I a writer because, within my 
friend group, I am known for writing 
long and weirdly candid Instagram cap-
tions? Or am I a writer only when I have 
something published? Or does that some-
thing have to be published by someone 
with a fancy New York office? 
I have always been at odds with my 
writing, often failing to find my voice in 
the words I type across the page. I am 
always afraid to write. And yet, here you 
are reading my words, maybe even enjoy-
ing them? 
When people ask why I study French 
when I already know English and Span-
ish I shrug off the question with a soft 
smile. Then when people started asking 
why I was adding German to the list, I 
began to wonder. I think the truth of it all 
is that I am still seeking to find my voice. 
I grew up with two languages: Spanish 
and English. The rules that govern these 
two are so different that I often get lost 
between them. Spanish is notorious for 
long sentences that take up more than 
one page. English, not so much. I remem-
ber the bright red letters at the top of my 
essay from an old teacher, reading: “You 
push the barriers of the English language 

too far” and “Your ideas get lost in a 
swarm of subordinate clauses.” 
With every sentence I write, I remem-
ber these words. They are permanently 
etched in my mind. They are a condem-
nation, a decree that I would never be a 
writer. 
For a long time, I worked hard to erase 
Spanish from my mind so that I could 
write well and in native-English — some-
thing I am not so sure I have learned to 
do. I have learned to push away the words 
that come naturally to me and, by doing 
so, I began erasing the memories of my 
childhood. In choosing English I began 
rewriting my history, writing over the 
Spanish. Eventually my dreams, too, are 
in English. In an attempt to grow into 
English, I began to bend myself into the 
acceptable use of the language. 
I think I found peace in the words of 
the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke. 
These are the words that echoed in my 
mind: 
“There is only one thing you should do. 
Go into yourself. Find out the reason that 
commands you to write; see whether it 
has spread its roots into the very depths 
of your heart; confess to yourself whether 

you would have to die if you were forbid-
den to write. This most of all: ask your-
self in the most silent hour of your night: 
must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep 
answer. And if this answer rings out in 
assent, if you meet this solemn question 
with a strong, simple ‘I must,’ then build 
your life in accordance with this neces-
sity.” 
But how would I be able to write about 
a past that is written in Spanish, I don’t 
think I could translate the love I had 
known in Spanish to English. I need to 
find a way to let both exist at peace with 
my voice as a writer. 
I don’t think I am any more of a writ-
er now than I was before. I just think I 
have used Rilke to justify the silent force 
inside me that wants to write. I am start-
ing to think that what makes you a writer 
is the choice. The choice that pushes you 
to keep writing even after rejections. The 
choice to keep writing through the fear. 
Maybe I haven’t found the voice that can 
balance all the parts of who I am, but that 
doesn’t make the statement “I am a writ-
er” a lie, it just means “I am a writer, and 
I am still growing.” And I think for now 
that is enough...
