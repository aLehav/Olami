After controversial 

disbandment, 

members discuss 

future for committee

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

The 
Central 
Student 

Government’s Campus Inclusion 
Commission, 
which 
disbanded 

last semester after its 11 members 
resigned 
following 
a 
conflict 

between the commission’s chair and 
the executive commission, has been 
reinstated with theappointment of 
LSA junior Kendall Poindexter as 
the new chair.

For CSG members, especially 

in light of upcoming elections 
for next year’s assembly in late 
March, the resignations prompted 
conversation 
about 
issues 
of 

transparency, identity and power 
dynamics within the body, as 
well as questions about how the 
assembly would move forward.

CSG 
commissions 
are 

committees of students chosen by 

the body’s executive committee 
to unite students behind specific 
areas on campus. The Inclusion 
Commission, whose purpose is to 
address campus issues associated 
with race, gender and the LGBTQ 
community, 
was 
effectively 

inoperative for the month following 
the members’ desertion of the 
commission.

In a Michigan in Color piece 

published last semester in The 
Michigan Daily, a former member 
of the Inclusion Commission wrote 
about why she and the 10 other 
members resigned. The article was 
temporarily retracted by the Daily 
for additional review— an edited 
version has since been republished.

Engineering 
junior 
Sindhu 

Sreedhar, former executive chair 
of the LGBTQ Issues Commission, 
said the power dynamics displayed 
during a meeting with members of 
the executive committee regarding 
commission 
consolidation 
left 

her 
feeling 
marginalized 
and 

dispensable.

Sreedhar was contacted multiple 

times for comment and did not 
respond.

PATH supports 

developing nations 

in providing 
immunization 

By MADELEINE GERSON

For the Daily

Ray 
Cummings, 
director 

of 
PATH 
— 
a 
nonprofit 

organization 
that 
aims 
to 

improve public health through 
vaccines 
— 
discussed 
the 

influence of vaccines in low-
income countries and other 
areas and the economic costs 
tied to immunization at a talk 
Wednesday.

Cummings 
spoke 
to 
an 

audience 
of 
approximately 

80 
students, 
faculty 
and 

community members at the 
Ross School of Business. The 
event was one of several in the 
annual William David Institute 

Global Impact Speaker Series.

Cummings’ nonprofit strives 

to improve global public health 
through five main platforms: 
vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, 
devices and system and service 
innovations. In 2014, PATH 
served 160 million individuals 
in more than 70 countries, 
working 
alongside 
UNICEF, 

the World Health Organization 
and other non-governmental 
organizations such as Gavi, the 
Vaccine Alliance.

PATH is currently working to 

combat the spread of rotavirus, 
Japanese 
encephalitis 
and 

pneumococcal 
pneumonia. 

The nonprofit hopes to further 
progress in terms of vaccine 
waste 
reduction, 
supply 

chain management and data

RESEARCH
Attachment in 
relationships 
linked to more 
online abuse

Insecurity leads to 
individuals tracking 

partner’s social 
media, phone use 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Feeling 
insecure 
about 

relationships and exhibiting 
anxious attachment often leads 
teens to engage in digital dating 
violence 
and 
electronically 

intrusive behaviors, according 
to 
a 
recent 
University 
of 

Michigan study.

According to the study, the 

availability of social media at 
nearly every teen’s disposal 
through smartphones and other 
electronics has given them the 
ability to electronically harass 
their partners and express 
insecurities 
regarding 
their 

relationships.

According to Pew Research 

Center’s “Teens, Social Media 
and 
Technology 
Overview 

2015,” 92 percent of teens ages 
13 to 17 report going online daily, 
with 24 percent saying they 
are online “almost constantly.” 
The report also highlighted 
that nearly three-quarters of 
teens own or have access to a 
smartphone.

This 
ease 
of 
access 
to 

technology leads to abusive 
behaviors 
in 
adolescence 

that are often predictive of 
abusive behavior throughout 
adulthood, the study showed.

Digital dating violence is 

defined as the use of technology 
to 
bully, 
harass, 
stalk 
or 

intimidate a dating partner, 
according 
to 
the 
National 

Domestic 
Violence 
Hotline. 

Abusive 
behaviors 
include 

sending 
negative 
messages 

online, controlling who the 
partner can and cannot be 
friends with or follow on 
social media sites, stealing a

speak with students about the 
RED Act this week. Meeting 
with students and talking about 
this issue with them, Stabenow 
said, is important because they 
are the ones directly affected.

“This is very personal for 

students,” she said. “Everyone 
on an individual basis has a

CAMPUS LIFE
Participants 
at IGR event 
develop plans 
for openness

Discussion focuses 
on how to talk about 
social justice with 

loved ones

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

About 20 students and faculty 

members filled a circle of chairs 
in the Intergroup Relations 
Office for a discussion called 
the Talking Social Justice with 
Those You Love Open Dialogue 
on Wednesday.

The event aimed to facilitate 

conversation on strategies for 
openly 
discussing 
different 

identities with loved ones in the 
participants’ lives, including 
family 
and 
friends. 
The 

discussion was part of IGR’s 
CommonGround group, which 
holds dialogues to facilitate 
conversations on issues such as 
race and gender throughout the 
semester.

Social Work student Jonathan 

Vanderbeck, an intern at IGR, 

See STABENOW, Page 3A
See DIALOGUE, Page 2A


and Corina Kesler, a facilitator 
with IGR and a researcher with 
the University’s International 
Institute, led the dialogue.

Vanderbeck said he intended 

the conversation to be in 
keeping with the Valentine’s 
season, in relation to love, but 
also to provoke reflection on 
the subject of open discussions 
about important issues.

“When 
you’re 
with 

loved ones, people you care 
about, how do you go about 
having 
these 
contentious 

conversations?” he said.

He said the dialogue was a 

part of IGR’s ongoing efforts 
to 
encourage 
openness 
in 

relationships.

“A lot of what IGR is about is 

learning how to dialogue, and 
at IGR we talk about dialogue 
being this third way between 
open discussion and debate,” 
he said. “Dialogue is a focused 
way of having a conversation.”

Attendees broke out into 

smaller 
groups 
based 
on 

which category of loved ones 
they found having dialogues 
about identity most difficult. 
The 
choices 
were 
family, 

classmates/coworkers, 
significant others and friends. 
The talk also allowed the entire 
group to come together and 
share their ideas.

Education graduate student 

Chelsea Noble said she liked 
how they could break into 
groups and get to know other 
participants.

“I really appreciated that 

they kept us moving between 
circles so you got to hear from 
different folks, but there was 
also some big group debrief,” 
Noble said. “It felt dynamic, 
it felt like you could get your 
voice heard in a small group 
but also hear from the big 
group.”

While 
in 
these 
smaller 

groups, Vanderbeck and Kesler 
asked participants to discuss 
why they felt dialogue was 
challenging with this type 
of loved one and also offered 
suggestions for possibly easing 
this difficulty. They brought 
up different topics of dialogue 

such as gender, race and sexual 
identity and allowed people 
to switch groups with every 
change of topic.

Kesler said the willingness 

of various people to share 
experiences and thoughts made 
this discussion possible.

“I think the presence of so 

many participants interested 
in learning made our role much 
easier,” she said. “If this was a 
success, it had very little to do 
with us, to be sure.”

Education graduate student 

LaQwana Dockery, a graduate 
intern with IGR, said she really 
appreciated the camaraderie 
she felt with other audience 
members.

“It was nice to be around 

people who share the same 
feelings about certain issues 
and topics when it comes to 
important people in our lives 
and when we want to talk 
about different issues that are 
important to us,” she said. “But 
also we don’t want to damage 
the relationships we have with 
certain people that we really 
care about,”

Dockery said the dialogue 
helped her see that there were 
different ways to express her 
opinions on social justice.

“There’s a lot of different 

ways that you can intervene 
and 
that 
necessarily 

doesn’t have to be directly 
confronting someone,” she 
said. “I think people who are 
really involved and passionate 
about social justice put the 
weight on their shoulders that 
we need to tackle every single 
issue at that moment, but 
that might not necessarily be 
the case sometimes. It might 
be important to change the 
subject or pull someone aside 
and talk to them the next 
day.”

BrightMatter 

devices will allow 
higher microscopic 
detail for doctors

By SOPHIE SHERRY

For the Daily

The University of Michigan 

Health System has recently 
acquired Synaptive Medical’s 
BrightMatter 
technology, 

a device that fuses high-
definition 
intraoperative 

visualization 
and 
surgical 

guidance to transform the 
way surgeons operate.

Currently, when surgeons 

want 
to 
view 
something 

in high detail they use a 
microscopic 
eyepiece. 
The 

field of view provided by 
this microscope is incredibly 
small 
and 
requires 
the 

surgeon to frequently move 
around while working. The 
surgeon is able to project 
two-dimensional images onto 
a screen for others in the 
operating room to see, but 
the surgeon her or himself 
cannot see that image. UMHS 
neurosurgeon Oren Sagher 
said the new device aims to 
change that.

“The BrightMatter device 

parts from that,” Sagher said. 
“The surgeon is now seeing 
the same high detail over a 
larger area and is able to see 
it on a large screen in front of 
them rather than having to 
look into a microscope.”

The device also allows 

all those in the operating 
room to see exactly what the 
surgeon is seeing. Sagher said 
he believes this will greatly 
improve communication and 
teaching capabilities in the 
operating room.

“Now 
everybody 
knows 

exactly what the surgeon 
is seeing and doing and the 
scrub can anticipate what 

the surgeon needs and (this) 
really greatly improves the 
workflow in the operating 
room,” he said.

What sets this device apart 

from 
current 
technology 

is that it combines more 
advanced 
visualization 

technology 
with 
surgical 

guidance, 
Sagher 
added. 

Currently, 
surgeons 
take 

digital images of a patient’s 
brain, 
for 
example, 
and 

reconstruct them into three-
dimensions. A computer in 
the 
operating 
room 
then 

guides the surgeon’s hand 
where to go according to this 
three-dimensional 
model. 

This technology has existed 
for more than 20 years but 
lives completely separately 
from the microscope used 
previously — this new device 
will combine them.

“If a surgeon was operating 

under a microscope, they 
cannot 
use 
the 
guidance 

system very easily, in fact 
sometimes not at all,” Sagher 
said. “With the Synaptive 
device, 
BrightMatter, 
not 

only can you do that, but it 
actually is integrated into 
the device. They are actually 
able to guide your view and 
your path exactly the way 
you have planned it based 
on the patient’s preoperative 
imaging.”

The device itself is a robot. 

The 
visualization 
camera 

hangs above the head of the 
surgeon and slightly in front 
of them in order to not get 
in their way. The surgeon is 
able to give the robot verbal 
commands to change paths 
and trajectories.

“It is just short of the ability 

of the robot to actually do the 
operation,” Sagher said. “It 
essentially allows the surgeon 
to just get to that limit where 
the surgeon is operating but 
being aided by the robot.”

The BrightMatter device 

is currently being used at a 

handful of hospitals across 
the 
country, 
including 

Henry 
Ford 
Hospital 
in 

Detroit. 
Karin 
Muraszko, 

chair of neurosurgery at the 
University, said while the 
BrightMatter device is costly, 
the University thinks it is a 
worthwhile investment.

“It’s a significant outlay 

of funds and a hospital has 
to feel that they have got 
the need for that kind of 
technology,” Muraszko said. 
“We view ourselves, and I 
think appropriately so, as a 
place that leads in cutting 
edge technologies. I think 
that, like everything, it is 
going to require a learning 
curve, but we have invested 
a fair amount of effort and 
time to access its feasible 
and usefulness in our own 
practice before we made the 
commitment to bring this 
system to Michigan.”

Both Sagher and Muraszko 

said 
they 
believe 
the 

University 
will 
uniquely 

implement of this technology 
due 
to 
the 
prominent 

brain tumor program the 
University has, as well as how 
they will be able to integrate 
the BrightMatter technology 
with 
a 
visualization 

instrument 
that 
another 

UMHS neurosurgeon, Daniel 
Orringer, 
has 
developed. 

Orringer 
has 
created 
a 

visualization 
instrument 

called 
stimulated 
Raman 

spectroscopy, which allows 
for the visualization of actual 
cells. This offers the potential 
to be able to differentiate 
between 
tumor 
cells 
and 

normal cells in the operating 
room.

“We 
can 
take 
a 
real 

breakthrough 
and 
make 

it 
a 
truly 
monumental 

breakthrough, 
leveraging 

what our in-house talents are 
here with Dr. Orringer’s SRS 
microscope,” Sagher said.

BOOK IT TO LITE R ATI


partner’s social media passwords 
and looking through a partner’s 
cellphone records to see who they 
are texting or calling.

Lead author of the study Lauren 

Reed was a doctoral student in 
the 
University’s 
 
Psychology 

Department when the study began 
and said she was interested in the 
ways that new forms of media, 
such as the Internet, cellphones, 
texting and social media sites 
impact dating relationships and 
shape dating violence.

“What we do is we ask teens and 

college students about what they 
do in relationships and then we 
also look at how is this associated 
with other things,” Reed said. 
“If you’re engaging in an activity 
that makes your partner feel 
uncomfortable or unsafe, or if 
it’s one of many behaviors that 
you’re engaging in that control or 
manipulate or threaten or harass 
your partner, then those are some 
problematic behaviors that could 
be abusive.”

According to a 2011 Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention 
nationwide survey, 23 percent of 
females and 14 percent of males 
who have experienced a sexual 
assault, act of physical violence or 
cyber-stalking from an intimate 
partner first experienced one 
of these forms of relationship 
violence between 11 and 17 years 
of age.

The CDC reported that for the 

person experiencing the abuse, 
certain types of violence can lead 
to engaging in alcohol and drug 
abuse, reporting symptoms of 
depression and increased anxiety 
and ultimately having greater risk 
to be on the receiving end of these 
abusive behaviors during college 
years.

Richard Tolman, School of 

Social Work professor, said from 
his previous workregarding forms 
of dating violence, including non-
digital abuse, it was clear the 
increasing use of social media and 
the Internet to control a romantic 
partner was becoming a major 
aspect of relationship abuse. 

“It was unusual to use media 

that way (in the past),” Tolman 
said. “Now with the dawn of the 
digital age — not the dawn any 
longer — pretty much everybody 
has that kind of surveillance 
monitoring technology available 
to them in their pocket on a 
smartphone. Eighth graders on 
up have access to this kind of 
technology that was once the 
province 
of 
mega-controlling 

abusive partners.”

The survey of teens was done 

in response to a UM survey 
done by Reed, she said, which 
included questions about common 
controlling behaviors such as 
monitoring a romantic partner and 
looking at a partner’s cellphone or 
computers without their consent.

In both the University survey 

and the high school student 
survey, researchers included a 
measure of attachment insecurity, 
which was linked to executing 
electronically abusive behaviors, 
Tolman said.

The high school student study 

surveyed 703 high school students 
from ninth grade to 12th grade and 
focused on more electronically 
intrusive behaviors than did the 
University survey, according to 
Reed.

“The reason that we did it in 

both age groups is that we wanted 
to know if these findings were 
consistent across age groups,” 
Reed said. “High school students 
(are) having their first dating 
experience, they’re new to dating, 
they might be more influenced by 
these digital media, so we wanted 

to replicate our college student 
survey in the high school. We 
had a better, more comprehensive 
measure of electronic intrusion 
than we did in the college survey, 
but we found still pretty consistent 
results across age groups.”

Reed said ultimately, these 

findings are indicative of what she 
calls a “cycle of anxiety.”

Insecurely 
attached 
high 

school and college students are 
more likely to engage in electronic 
intrusion in their relationships, 
Reed said. Seeing a photo or post 
on social media could trigger their 
anxiety, leading to increased use of 
electronically intruding behaviors 
in an attempt to alleviate their 
anxiety.

“The more you look and the 

more you intrude in your partner’s 
privacy, probably the more anxiety 
you’re going to have,” Reed said.

The question arises as to where 

the line is between normal social 
media and technology use in a 
relationship, and digital abuse, 
both researchers said.

“I don’t think we know enough 

to say where the exact line 
is,” Tolman said. “Part of that 
depends on the perceptions of 
the people involved to be sure. 
Unquestionably, there is some 
version of this that is normative. 
(However) 
saying 
that 
it’s 

normative doesn’t mean it is 
good or positive, it may be that 
it’s something that just about 
everybody does a little bit of.”

Social media use today is often 

an acceptable way to check in 
with one’s partner, Tolman said. 
However, when social media use 
becomes a pervasive behavior 
that continuously proves harmful 
to a partner and begins to define 
that relationship, it can cause 
psychological damage.

He added that was important, 

particularly 
for 
insecurely 

attached individuals, to know 

their 
personal 
boundaries 
as 

well as what their partners are 
comfortable with in terms of 
checking social media and other 
forms of technology to check in on 
a relationship.

“The 
findings 
from 
the 

study hint that … there may be 
aspects of times of insecurities 
that somebody brings into a 
relationship that could add to their 
increasing this activity in a way 
that could be problematic to the 
relationship,” Tolman said. 

Some previous findings have 

indicated that it is possible that 
young men and young women 
have behavioral and emotional 
differences in the way that they 
use and interpret social media. 
However, in this most recent 
study, Tolman said few differences 
were observed.

“We found that attachment and 

insecurity predicted perpetration 
of electronic intrusion similarly 
for boys and girls,” he said. “But 
we did find that, in our study, 
girls reported more perpetration 
of electronic intrusion than boys 
did.”

He added that this might 

simply be because females are 
more likely to be more honest 
reporters of their digital activities. 
On the other hand, however, this 
electronic intrusion could be 
intended for positively preserving 
and maintaining a relationship.

“Although 
there 
are 
some 

positive uses of digital media in 
dating relationships, and it’s great 
way to build intimacy and bond 
between partners, for anxiously 
attached teenagers and college 
students, this might exacerbate 
their anxiety and lead to potential 
emotional abuse,” Reed said.

Ultimately, 
Tolman 
said 

the 
overuse 
and 
misuse 
of 

digital 
media 
in 
adolescence 

for the purpose of controlling 
relationships can be predictive of 

adult behavior, as has been seen in 
other forms of non-digital dating 
violence.

“The issue is not so much 

stopping 
or 
somehow 
trying 

to temper the amount of use, 
though that might be possible, 
but certainly teaching people 
about how to manage boundaries 
more effectively and more self-
management strategies and coping 

with this relational context that is 
now an everyday reality,” Tolman 
said. “It does signal a broader 
societal need, and certainly an 
individual need, for teaching 
people how to better manage 
these kind of relational issues 
when social media is involved, and 
when it’s not, too.”

ANXIETY

country needs to go through 
on its own,” Cummings said. 
“We can help them get more 
for their money through the 
immunization process.”

Cummings 
explained 
the 

economic value of investing in 
immunizations, saying there is 
generally a positive return on 
such an investment.

“Economists at PATH and a 

number of groups have looked 
at the cost effectiveness of 
these 
vaccines,” 
Cummings 

said. “The metric that is most 
commonly used is disability-
adjusted life year. That is the 
measurement for the average 
amount of healthy years of life 
that are spared by a particular 
intervention.”

Cummings 
noted 
that 

distribution systems differ for 
lower income countries, Gavi 
is involved in providing the 
funding for vaccination, while 
UNICEF is focused on the 
distribution and procurement 
of vaccines.

After 
the 
event, 
Peiyu 

Yu, 
Public 
Policy 
senior, 

agreed 
that 
there 
is 
a 

significant economic benefit 
to 
vaccination, 
but 
raised 

concerns over how vaccines 
are implemented and received 
in foreign countries.

“I 
do 
not 
know 
what 

countries with a large aging 
population will do and if they 
are ready to cover term health 
costs,” Yu said. “The resistance 
of intervention is that some 
countries 
have 
a 
history 

of 
not 
welcoming 
Western 

intervention because of deep 
skepticism.”

Cummings also discussed 

the organization’s challenges, 
citing the expensive cost of new 
vaccines as well as the problem 
which 
arises 
as 
countries 

transition out of Gavi eligibility 
and become responsible for the 
cost of immunization.

With the rising costs of new 

and expensive vaccines, PATH 
is struggling to pay for the more 
costly medication, he said.

Furthermore, as countries 

gain wealth, they no longer 
meet the threshold to attain 
vaccinations 
through 
Gavi 

and must pay for vaccines 
themselves. The World Bank 
defines low-income countries 

as those which have a gross 
national income per capita of 
less than $1,045. To be eligible 
for aid from Gavi, the country 
has to have a GNI per capita of 
below $1,580.

Ari Shwayder, lecturer of 

business economics, said the 
challenge 
for 
transitional 

nations was significant.

“For me, the idea is that we 

have to think about new ways 
for getting the middle-income 
countries vaccines,” Shwayder 
said. “We need to work with 
manufactures 
to 
develop 

cheaper vaccines, to focus on 
the supply side.”

The 
World 
Health 

Organization 
estimates 

that 2.5 million deaths are 
prevented per year due to 
vaccines. 
Cummings 
said 

amid some resistance and 
controversy 
surrounding 

vaccines, 
their 
importance 

remains clear.

“I hope I have given you 

some appreciation for what 
impact vaccines have had in 
public health and in what 
terms vaccines have had in 
saving lives, and in doing so 
economically,” Cummings told 
the crowd.

helps me make sure we are on 
the right track.”

Stabenow said since the 

time she attended college, the 
percentage of funding provided 
by the state to the University 
of Michigan has decreased 
from 70 to a percentage in 
the mid-20s. More recently, 
funding for higher education 
was cut by 15 percent in 2011. 
Overall, in recent years state 
funding for higher education 
has seen both cute — including 
a 15 percent one in 2011 
— and small increases. In 
Gov. Rick Snyder’s recently 
released budget proposal for 
the upcoming fiscal year, he 
recommended a 4.3 percent 
increase in higher education 
funding, which would bring 
the total funding back to pre-
2011 levels.

The RED Act incorporates 

portions of a bill proposed by 
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s 
(D–Mass.) 
in 
2014, 
which 

would 
allow 
student 
loan 

borrowers to refinance high-
interest 
loans 
and 
create 

fixed interest rates for future 
borrowers, 
in 
contrast 
to 

the variable rates borrowers 
face now. U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell (D–Dearborn) has also 
cosponsored a similar bill in 

Congress that would allow 
student loan refinancing.

The bill would additionally 

allow two years of tuition 
and fees to be waived for 
community 
college 
and 

technical school and increase 
the funding for federal Pell 
Grants. In his State of the 
Union address in January, 
President Barack Obama called 
for the former aspect of the 
current bill. 

Stabenow said these three 

main aspects of the bill are 
achievable if Congress can 
come together in a bipartisan 
effort.

“We basically have three 

things that we are doing that 
are very doable if we can get 
the 
bipartisan 
support 
we 

need,” she said.

Pamela Fowler, executive 

director 
of 
the 
office 
of 

financial aid at the University 
who was at the event, said in 
recent years the University has 
been increasing financial aid 
by an average of 12 percent, 
and students and prospective 
students need to be more aware 
of the resources available to 
them to help alleviate debt.

“Affordability is something I 

live personally every day,” she 
said. “How do we let people 
know that they can afford to 
come here? Once they see that 
they can afford to go here then 
the word will get out.”

Stabenow 
said 
outside 

groups, including the National 
Association of Realtors, have 
spoken up about the need to 
aid the student debt crisis, as 
it affects the overall economy. 
She added that providing that 
assistance 
depends 
on 
the 

government’s priorities, and 
higher 
education 
strongly 

influences the economy and 
should be better supported.

“It’s a question of priorities 

and 
how 
you 
grow 
the 

economy,” she said. “Higher 
education is an economic driver 
and we ought to be heavily 
supporting that at every level.”

Public Policy senior Max 

Lerner, chair of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
who was also at the event, said 
he appreciates the support of 
Stabenow and other Democrats 
on this issue, as he does not see 
the same urgency within the 
Republican Party.

“It’s great to see Democrats 

and Sen. Stabenow are taking 
student issues and the college 
debt crisis very seriously,” he 
said. “Republicans clearly are 
not. Snyder is continuing to 
divest in public education and 
higher education and it really 
a shame as Michigan students 
are literally being priced out of 
a higher education because of 
this governor’s policies.”

“He is a white man in a higher 

position than me, and had just 
implied that that I was dispensable. 
I’m a woman of color with 
seemingly no real authority in 
that space,” she wrote, referencing 
a member of CSG’s executive 
committee. “Whose voice really 
matters here? I felt as though the 
LGBTQ community that I was 
advocating for had suddenly lost 
any voice that it may have ever had 
in CSG.”

CSG chief of staff, LSA junior 

Sean Pitt was integral in the 
restructuring of the commissions 
and 
conveyed 
the 
executive 

committee’s decision to combine 
commissions, which was in part 
the catalyst for the commision’s 
disbandment. At the beginning 
of the 2016 fall semester, CSG 
launched a complete restructuring 
of the body’s 19 commissions, 
cutting 11. Some of these former 
commissions were turned into sub-
commissions.

At a CSG meeting on Dec. 1, 

after the Michigan in Color piece 
had been published, CSG President 
Cooper 
Charlton 
called 
the 

resignation a misunderstanding but 
acknowledged the writer’s concerns 
about the power structure.

“The author of this article felt 

negatively about this proposal due 
to the power dynamic in the room,” 
Charlton said.

Charlton added there was further 

misunderstanding 
surrounding 

the measures of restorative justice 
that were agreed upon after the 
perceived microaggression.

“Because full information was 

not provided to the commission, 
negative 
sentiment 
towards 

the executive committee grew 
surrounded in the idea that the 
executive chose not to meet the 
requests for restorative justice,” 
Charlton said. “The sentiment that 
grew within this commission is 
founded on false information, and 
there is no evidence to support 
these claims.”

In interviews with The Michigan 

Daily, CSG representatives said 
the events of last semester were 
troubling and full of confusion.

LSA 
and 
Education 
senior 

Michael Chrzan, a School of 
Education representative, said in an 
email interview hearing there were 
issues with diversity in CSG spurred 
him to run during the mid-term 
elections last semester to reclaim 
his seat on the assembly. Following 
the incident, Chrzan contacted the 
commission members who had 
resigned to get their perspective.

“From 
my 
outsider 
view 

and someone who came into 
this discussion really late, I’d 
say personally it was a lack of 

transparency and communication 
on numerous levels,” Chrzan said.

Charlton said the restructuring 

was necessary to actualize the 
potential of these commissions, 
which hadn’t been seen in the past.

“Of the 19 commissions, only five 

of them were active, and by that 
I mean had communication with 
the executive team,” Charlton said. 
“Of those five, only three of them 
produced changes that students 
actually 
felt. 
Fourteen 
either 

didn’t do anything because they 
were vacant, didn’t have enough 
members to function or frankly 
just gave up halfway through the 
semester.”

However, though the inclusivity 

commission 
was 
disbanded, 

members of CSG said the body 
continued to make progress on 
issues of campus inclusivity. LSA 
sophomore Anushka Sarkar, CSG 
chief programming officer, said the 
initiatives they had been working 
on were implemented in other ways.

“Maybe there was a vacuum 

on paper, but the initiatives the 
commission was being tasked with 
fell to the executive committee or 
the other body members,” Sarkar 
said.

Chrzan wrote though he did 

not have much experience with 
the commissions prior to this 
semester, he was in support of their 
consolidation.

“That being said, I would argue 

the decision could have been made 
and communicated in a better way,” 
Chrzan wrote. “I know that some 
commissions were upset about the 
change and also upset about how 
it was communicated, specifically 
those in the Campus Inclusion 
Commission.”

Chrzan said he has seen more 

of the commissions and their work 
than he ever had before, but noted 
he attributed the change to the CSG 
chief of staff Sean Pitt, more than 
the new structure.

Issues of transparency, identity 

and power dynamics have also been 
raised by members of newMich 
and Your Michigan — two political 
platforms which have emerged 
in preparation for the upcoming 
March CSG election — in reactions 
to the commission’s walk-off.

Public Policy junior Thomas 

Hislop, a CSG representative and 
Your 
Michigan’s 
presidential 

candidate, said CSG relies heavily 
on its commissions to fulfill its 
directives on campus.

“People 
often 
forget 
that 

commissions are such a resource for 
us,” Hislop said. “I’m a deep believer 
in the power of these commissions, 
and I think Cooper’s administration 
did a really great job of redesigning 
those nine commissions that really 
do have a voice and a power so that 
they can go forward with their 
initiatives.” 

LSA 
junior 
David 
Schafer, 

a CSG representation heading 
newMICH’s executive ticket, said 
the events of last semester need to 
be a wake-up call for the assembly.

“What happened last semester, 

it’s entirely unfortunate. Anytime 
a student feels silenced, where 
their voice is not heard, regardless 
of the circumstances, we need to 
care about that and we need to do 
something about that,” Schafer 
said. “Of course when everyone 
on the commission resigned, that 
was not something you should look 
happily upon.”

Hislop voiced similar sentiments 

about the events surrounding the 
commission.

“Obviously it was unfortunate 

what 
happened 
last 
semester, 

and you know I know there was 
some frustration with how it was 
published as well,” Hislop said. 
“It was a really unfortunate event 
because that’s not what CSG is 
about, and I think the people 
behind Cooper, they do believe in 
the importance of inclusivity and 
diversity on this campus.”

CSG 
representative 
Micah 

Griggs, an LSA junior running for 
vice president with newMich, said 
their knowledge of the current 
power dynamics of the body sets 
them apart as a party.

“I think what’s unique here 

is that we realize the root of the 
problem when someone didn’t 
understand their power and their 
privilege in a certain situation,” 
Griggs said. “Having an IGR 
mandatory workshop can prevent 
those things from happening and 
work towards being more inclusive 
by understanding our identities and 
how they impact others.”

Intergroup 
Relations, 
a 

University 
program 
of 
social 

justice education, offers training 
to student organizations to create 
understanding of inequalities and 
the influence of diverse identities.

Sarkar, who is the campaign 

manager for newMich, said their 
platform includes plans for opt-in 
CSG newsletters and text alerts so 
that the student body is informed of 
what goes on behind closed doors.

“A commission chair resigning 

would definitely be an alert that 
would go out to people,” Sarkar said.

LSA junior Shamaila Ashraf, 

who is running on newMich ticket 
for the upcoming CSG election, 
said though she was not on the 
assembly at the time, she believed 
it displayed a lack of transparency 
and accountability on the side of the 
executive committee.

“Transparency 
in 
terms 
of 

what is CSG doing, what are these 
commissions? And then the other 
side, the accountability, who are we 
putting in those positions and how 
are they trained?” Ashraf said.

Prompt appointment needed

Furthermore, cases concerning divisive 

issues such as abortion, affirmative action, 
contraception, public unions and immigration 
are all on the docket for this Supreme 
Court term. By leaving Scalia’s seat vacant, 
Republicans risk a 4-4 tie on many of these 
controversial votes. This is a problem because 
tie votes uphold the decision of the lower court 
in that court’s respective jurisdiction, which 
does not establish national precedent. If these 
cases are heard by an eight-member Court in 
the term that begins in October, a tie vote would 
essentially mean the hearings were a waste of 
the Court’s time. It is therefore essential that 
the Senate fulfills its constitutional obligation 
by at least considering an Obama nominee.

Republicans argue that a nominee should 

not be considered during the election cycle. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 
(R-Ky.) and the rest of the GOP caucus maintain 
that the people should have a say in choosing 
a nominee through their vote in November. 
While Republicans assert that nominating 
a replacement during an election season is 
misguided, 
history 
disagrees. 
Throughout 

history, there have been eight Supreme Court 
nominations during election season, and six have 
been confirmed. On average, it takes 25 days to 
vote on a Supreme Court justice once nominated. 
Constitutional duties, along with government 
precedent, should not be suddenly suspended 
because a presidential election is ongoing.

Obstructing the nomination process not only 

spurs inflamed partisan divides, but it could also 

disjoint the normal decision-making process 
of the Court. The potential for numerous 4-4 
split votes on many critical issues will mean 
the decisions of the lower courts will be upheld 
within their respective jurisdictions, but the case 
does not establish precedent for later Supreme 
Court cases. The American people need and 
deserve a full Supreme Court so the nation can 
have closure on issues of such critical importance.

The Republican-controlled Senate must 

fulfill its obligation to the citizens of the 
United States and work with the president to 
confirm a new nominee. The Supreme Court 
was designed, through lifetime appointments, 
to stay the test of time and be greater than 
the political squabbling of our country. The 
late Justice Scalia himself best exemplified 
this ideal when he requested that President 
Obama fill an empty seat with Elena Kagan, 
now the most liberal member of the Supreme 
Court. Even though she contradicts Scalia 
ideologically, he chose her because he believed 
the Court needed a brilliant, qualified mind 
arguing the most important issues of our day, 
regardless of belief.

It is time for Senate Republicans to move past 

partisanship and do what they were elected 
to do. Nominating a Supreme Court justice is 
one of the Senate’s most crucial constitutional 
obligations and should not be a political fight. 
Legislators cannot simply abandon their 
constitutional duties and disrespect two 
centuries of precedent — their jobs are too 
important and the stakes are too high. 

Incestuous, integral and in loving memory
T

oday is my great uncle Gail’s 
memorial service.

I called my dad last Sat-

urday evening to 
invite him and 
my stepmom to 
dinner 
for 
my 

birthday when he 
told me the news. 
My dad, just wak-
ing up from a nap, 
sounded groggy. 
There 
was 
an 

edge of sadness 
in his voice.

“Aunt 
Mar-

ian texted me,” 
he 
interjected. 

“Uncle Gail passed away yesterday.”

“Wow,” I responded, recalling 

the last time I had seen my grand-
ma’s brother-in-law. It was my dad 
and stepmom’s wedding, held on my 
grandma’s 75th birthday, in their 
backyard. My grandma was more 
than happy to share her birthday 
with my dad and his new wife. 

After a brief pause, I continued, 

“I knew he wasn’t doing well, but 
I didn’t know it was that bad. Do 
you know when memorial service 
is yet?”

There was no question in my mind 

concerning my schedule: I was going 
home to see my family. 

***
I grew up in a small town — a vil-

lage — that, generally, I did not leave 
for the first 18 years of my life. As a 
senior in high school, I only applied 
to two colleges, both less than an 
hour drive from home. (Thankfully, 
I was accepted at the University of 
Michigan before having to apply to 
Michigan State.) Leaving was excit-
ing, yet it simultaneously scared 
me; I needed the stimulating expe-
rience of a completely different 
place with the security blanket of 
somewhere that was close to home.

Now, after almost five years in 

college, I envision all of the things 
I can accomplish, and I don’t want 
to look back.

“If I don’t leave now, I don’t think 

I ever will,” I told one of my cowork-

ers during a lull in customer traffic.

She rolled her eyes, understand-

ably, at my constant use of the 
word village to describe my home-
town during our conversation. I 
kept rambling.

“I don’t know, though. It’s really 

hard. I love Michigan and I have a 
really big family. All of my siblings 
are still in Parma. All of them have 
kids. I don’t want to miss anything. 
But I feel like I need to see more of 
the world and find the way I can best 
help others. It’s weird to think about. 
I feel so conflicted sometimes.”

Struggling with my past, pres-

ent and future, I went to visit my 
personal essay professor, John 
Rubadeau, during his office hours. 
In our first conversation, I told 
him about my family: My brother is 
married to, and has a son with, one 
of my best friends from high school. 
He’s buying the house my three 
siblings and I grew up in from our 
dad. My youngest brother and his 
pregnant girlfriend live with them. 
My sister lived in the house with 
her husband and (now four) kids for 
nearly three years before moving 
10 minutes outside the village. And 
that’s just the surface.

Deliberating for a moment while 

chewing his gum, John responded: 
“Sounds incestuous.”

“Hmm,” I contemplated, sorting 

through the facts about my family in 
my head. “That’s a good word for it.”

But, after leaving his office that 

day, something kept bothering me. 
The connotation of “incestuous” 
seemed so negative. I Googled the 
definition:

1. Involving or guilty of incest
OK, my family is close, but not 

that close.

2. (of human relations gener-

ally) excessively close or resistant to 
outside influence, esp. as to prevent 
proper functioning

Bingo. Incestuous implies some-

thing improper. 

***
On Sunday evening, the day after 

my dad told me about Gail’s death, 
the local newspaper released his 

obituary, which I’ve paraphrased 
below. I read it online and was 
amazed by the things I didn’t know 
about my great uncle:

Lloyd “Gail” Reardon was born 

in 1931 on County Farm Road on the 
outskirts of the village of Parma. He 
loved sports and went to the same 
high school as me and nearly all of 
my dad’s family; then, it was Parma 
High School. He met my great aunt 
Marian, my grandma’s sister, when 
she stopped into Gail’s Friendly Gas 
Station, now my uncle’s shop, Don 
Marsh Service. They had six kids — 
four sons and two daughters. In 1959, 
the year before my father’s birth, 
Gail became the youngest mayor 
of Parma. He owned and operated 
several successful businesses: Gail’s 
Friendly Service gas station and 
repairs, Parma Party Store, Gail’s 
Pizza, Gail’s Car Wash, Reardon 
Realty and probably a few I’m miss-
ing here. He was known to many as 
“Mr. Parma.” His favorite mantra 
was “Keep on keeping on.” He always 
put others first. 

Suddenly, a different, more fit-

ting term popped into my head. 
Integral. Google made this clear for 
me with a definition:

1. (adj) necessary to make a whole 

complete; essential or fundamental.

Gail, and most of the other resi-

dents in our small town, played an 
integral role in the history of Parma, 
shaping the place it is today. He 
planted a seed that extended well 
beyond his six children and numer-
ous grandchildren. Uncle Gail did 
so much for my family, his extended 
family and so many other people. His 
influence is everywhere — my young-
est brother’s middle name is Lloyd.

In the same way, Parma plays an 

integral role in my history, shap-
ing who I am today. And, no matter 
where I end up after graduation, I’ll 
never let that go.

In loving memory of Lloyd “Gail”

AARICA 

MARSH

A feminist undecided for 2016
I

n politics, labels are paramount. I’m 
frequently reminded of this fact during 
conversations with one of my older 

siblings. Our discussions 
— while usually respectful 
— often devolve into a clash 
of 
policy 
perspectives 

between a republican and 
the family’s designated 
“bleeding-heart 
liberal.” 

More often than not, the 
phrase is intended as a 
light-hearted 
jab, 
but 

there’s 
certainly 
some 

truth to the title. My 
opinions regularly lean a 
little to the left. However, 
I can’t deny that the 
political identifiers my sibling and I attribute 
to one another, from time to time, have led us 
to misjudge each other’s beliefs and stances 
on issues.

Republican. Democrat. Conservative. Lib-

eral. Independent.

With these designations — self-proclaimed 

or not — come a variety of assumptions. In a 
highly polarized political sphere, these titles 
are often — and sometimes poorly — used as 
societal determinants of which candidate is 
supposedly best suited to occupy an office, 
where a candidate should supposedly stand 
on an issue, how voters supposedly should 
vote and how they actually will vote. Momen-
tarily casting partisanship aside, the use of 
labels such as “feminist” and “millennial” 
have recently created tension among female 
voters within the Democratic Party.

Addressing millennial women, renowned 

feminist figureheads Gloria Steinem and 
Madeleine Albright recently voiced their con-
cerns about the vast number of young female 
voters supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders over 
Hillary Clinton.

Steinem, viewing female support for Sand-

ers as perhaps an attempt by young women to 
avoid accusations of a bias toward their own 
gender, or as an attempt to seem more united or 
more likable to their male counterparts, stated, 
“When you’re young, you’re thinking, ‘Where 
are the boys?’ The boys are with Bernie.”

During a Clinton rally in New Hampshire, 

Albright stressed the need for the younger gen-
eration’s support to continue progress toward 
gender equality by saying, “We can tell our 
story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot 
of you younger women think it’s done … It’s not 
done. There’s a special place in hell for women 
who don’t help each other.”

Unsurprisingly, Albright and Steinem’s 

commentary wasn’t well-received by young 
female voters. Millennial women viewed the 
remarks as condescending. Young women 
interpreted the comments as yet another ren-
dition of a prevalent narrative told by older 
generations that deems the millennial gener-
ation self-absorbed, lazy, unaware and short-
sighted. The statements could be viewed as 
contradictory to feminist values. Feminism 
— at its core — stresses the importance of a 
woman’s ability to make her own decisions, 
and a woman should be able to do so without 
her individual agency being questioned.

Additionally, whether a woman decides 

to vote for the only female candidate in the 
party certainly doesn’t provide a measure of 
her effectiveness as a feminist. The move-
ment is meant to be intersectional in its prac-
tice. Therefore, it’s crucial to recognize that 
gender is merely one of numerous factors and 
experiences capable of influencing an indi-
vidual’s vote.

However, the reactions to Steinem’s and 

Albright’s remarks do highlight prevalent 
issues within both the political campaign 
process and the feminist sphere.

It’s understandable why generations of 

older women and older female political fig-
ures are seeking solidarity among female 
voters. Hillary Clinton faces a unique and 
undoubtedly difficult situation as a woman 
in politics and, more importantly, as a woman 
whose entrance into the presidency would 
make history.

Clinton, as a result of sexism, faces myriad 

obstacles that her male competitors don’t. 
Gender itself is an issue that arose in her first 
presidential bid and remains one she must 
carefully navigate in her present campaign. 
Her status as a woman, if ignored, will likely 
result in the public viewing her as inauthen-
tic and unlikeable. If she tries to acknowledge 
her status as a woman, Clinton runs the risk 
of not being taken as seriously as her counter-
parts or of taking advantage of her gender to 
appeal to the female demographic.

Even recently, issues arose around the 

topic of shouting during campaign speech-
es. While theatrics and shouting certainly 
haven’t been in short supply for either party 
during the campaign process, Clinton’s use 
of tactics that her male competitors regularly 
utilize is frequently interpreted by viewers as 
overly aggressive and off-putting.

The commentary from Albright and 

Steinem illustrates the existence of a profes-
sional, ideological and experience-related 

MELISSA 

SCHOLKE

gap between generations of women. 
Women from the older genera-
tion may have more experience 
with these double standards, and 
research proves Steinem’s point 
that women professionally “lose 
power as they age.” Younger women 
do need to take these factors into 
account, and acknowledge that they 
perhaps are privileged in ways their 
predecessors weren’t.

Older generations may be eager 

to increase concerningly low lev-
els of female representation in 
government and to further along 
initiatives to end inequality in a 
variety of realms. However, they 
must recognize many members of 
the younger generation share their 
aims. The older generation must 
also be willing to accept that the 
younger has its own set of experi-
ence with inequality and its own set 
of challenges. For older feminists, 
perhaps the only viable next step 
guaranteed to break down barriers 

is to elect a woman into the White 
House. Yet younger voters may see 
alternatives to continue achiev-
ing progress. A number of younger 
women, in fact, claim the reason 
they support Sanders is because 
they believe his platform would be 
more effective for ensuring equal-
ity and economic stability.

Feminism is not one-size-fits-all. 

Rather than further exacerbate a 
generational gap, perhaps the best 
option for female Democrats is to 
shift away from labels, expectations 
and distinctions between older and 
younger. Instead, voters need to 
direct their focus to the candidate’s 
stances on concrete policies.

Clinton inarguably has a vast 

amount of beneficial executive and 
foreign policy experience working as 
the secretary of state, and has placed 
a large emphasis on the importance of 
paid family leave. Additionally, she’s 
argued against the Hyde Amend-
ment. Conversely, Sander’s policies 

concerning “Medicare for all” and 
free college tuition are appealing to 
a generation of women plagued by 
debt, disillusioned by various aspects 
of higher education and anxious 
about achieving financial stability.

Over the years, I grew accus-

tomed to hearing the idea that votes 
shouldn’t be swayed by political 
labels or allegiances to a particular 
party. Voters must now also be cau-
tious of allegiances toward a par-
ticular gender or a particular age 
demographic. During this nomina-
tion period, voters shouldn’t place 
emphasis upon the gender or the 
superficial likability of the candi-
date, but rather on the candidates’ 
platforms and on their ability to 
improve conditions for all individu-
als and make substantial progress. 
In the case of this particular liberal 
and feminist, I’m still undecided.

T

he death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has caused 
the already-volatile American political environment to reach a 
new height. Republicans are now rallying behind the idea that 

the next president should be the one to nominate a new justice. However, 
President Obama has the constitutional obligation and right to nominate 
someone, just as the Republican-controlled Senate has the constitutional 
obligation to consider that nominee. Inaction on this issue due to overt 
partisan politics is not the correct solution to this situation, and not a 
precedent our government should establish.

Sophomores seek next step

Wolverines return 
three freshman All-
Americans to power 

lineup in 2016

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

If the past is any indication, 

it won’t be long before we start 
hearing the names of Michigan 
baseball’s incoming freshman 
class in the news.

Over the last three seasons 

— 
under 
fourth-year 
coach 

Erik Bakich — the 15th-ranked 
Wolverines have led the country 
in freshman All-Americans.

Last year, Michigan’s first 

Big Ten Tournament-winning 
team 
since 
2008 
featured 

upperclassman 
leaders 
like 

pitcher 
Jacob 
Cronenworth 

and outfielder Jackson Glines, 
both now with professional 
organizations. 
But 
freshmen 

were also an integral part of the 
team’s success down the stretch.

Bakich didn’t hesitate to use 

sophomore third baseman Jake 
Bivens right away last season, 
and Bivens exceeded everyone’s 
expectations. En route to being 
named Big Ten Freshman of the 
Year, Bivens started 62 out of 
the Wolverines’ 63 games in his 
first year.

With the exception of Grant 

Reuss, a lefty who redshirted 
last year, every freshman played 
a large role on the team in 2015. 

Right-handed pitchers Ryan 

Nutof and Bryan Pall joined 
Bivens on the Louisville Slugger 
Freshman All-American team, 
and the other freshman pitchers 
— right-handers Jayce Vancena 
and left-handers Oliver Jaskie 

and Michael Hendrickson — all 
appeared in 19 or more games 
and combined for a 4.57 ERA. 

Infielder/catcher 
Drew 

Lugbauer also stepped up as a 
freshman, seeing action in 42 
games. His batting average was 
just .211, but that was in part 
due to many hard-hit outs and 
balls that didn’t quite carry in 
deep parks. 

Bakich spoke positively of 

how 
Lugbauer 
handled 
the 

adversity, and said despite what 
the stat line showed, Lugbauer 
put in many quality at-bats for 
the Wolverines.

“There was a time when 

he was trying to do too much, 
and was overly aggressive at 
some pitches he should’ve laid 
off,” Bakich said. “But that was 
because he wanted it so bad.” 

The freshmen last year are 

now sophomores looking to 
make even bigger contributions. 
Having contributed so heavily 
to Michigan’s run into the 
NCAA regional, the class is now 
ready to move into bigger roles 
to help this year’s squad achieve 
even more.

“Being able to experience 

that as a freshman adds some 
fuel to the fire,” said Lugbauer. 
“We got that under our belt, and 
now there is so much more to 
accomplish.”

Bakich says Lugbauer will 

be a regular part of the middle 
of the lineup this year and 
will rotate positions between 
catcher, first base and third 
base. Bivens, meanwhile, will 
move into the leadoff spot in 
the batting order, and Reuss has 
worked on his command and 
will take on a sizable role in the 
pitching staff.

Not only has the class of 2018 

improved its game on the field 

this offseason, but they have 
also established chemistry off 
the field that will help them 
as they kick off the season in 
Florida this weekend.

“We have a really close, close 

class,” Bivens said. “I’m grateful 
that (the other sophomores) are 
my best friends.”

Added 
Bakich: 
“The 

chemistry on this team is the 
best I’ve seen. The talent that 
we have in the locker room is 
better than what we have on the 
field. And we’ve got some pretty 
talented guys on the field.”

A 
tight-knit 
Michigan 

will hope to bring this year’s 

freshman class into the mix 
on a team with 19 returning 
letterwinners, hoping they can 
have the same kind of impact 
first-year players have had in 
previous years.

Freshman Ako Thomas will 

be starting at second base Friday 
against 
Canisius. 
Freshman 

infielder 
Jimmy 
Kerr 
and 

freshman outfielder Jonathon 
Engelmann are expected to 
make early-season contributions 
as well.

For this class, there are high 

expectations, and they will be 
hoping to replicate the success 
of their predecessors.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines fall to 
Maryland on road

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

During the second half against 

Maryland on Wednesday night, 
Madison 
Ristovski 
gave 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team a fighting chance.

With every rebound, steal and 

basket the senior guard made, she 
kept the Wolverines afloat against 
the sixth-ranked Terrapins, who 
were hungry to finally take the 
lead. Largely due to Ristovski’s 
second-quarter heroics, Michigan 
came out of the first half leading a 
top-10 opponent by one point.

But the Wolverines’ strong 

first-half 
defense 
eventually 

succumbed to the pressures of an 
unstoppable Maryland offense. 
As was the case Jan. 14 against 
the Terrapins, Michigan allowed 
a few scoring droughts to get the 
best of it, and Maryland came out 
unscathed with a 76-56 win in 
College Park.

“I thought we did a great job, 

obviously, in the first half of really 
taking Maryland out of what they 
normally do,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “But the No. 6 
team in the country really showed 
why they were the No. 6 team 
in the country tonight with the 
balanced attack they had.”

Michigan’s 
full-court 
press 

completely took Maryland for a 
spin in the first quarter by forcing 
11 turnovers and allowing the 
Wolverines (7-8 Big Ten, 15-11 
overall) to defensively assert their 
dominance. In fact, the Terrapins 
didn’t even score their first field 
goal until four minutes into the 
game — knocking down just two 
free throws two minutes prior.

Unable to keep possession, 

Maryland (13-2, 24-3) turned the 
ball over at half-court twice in a 
row, which allowed sophomore 
forward Jillian Dunston to score 
four of Michigan’s first six points 
30 seconds apart.

“The 
scary 
part 
against 

Maryland with doing that is their 
size,” Barnes Arico said. “But we 
went with it anyway just to try to 
change that tempo, and that really 
was effective for us and helped us 

be able to score.”

The Wolverines’ defense was 

shining, and that helped spark 
good things on the offensive 
end. But in the second quarter, 
Michigan went on a 3:41 scoring 
drought and the Terrapins’ 10-0 
run brought the game to within 
only one point. Ristovski didn’t let 
the lead slip, scoring two baskets 
before the drought and two to end 
it, and allowed her team to stay 
up at the half despite four lead 
changes in one minute.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
Maryland 
figured 

out how to fight past Michigan’s 
defensive 
pressure, 
which 

prevented the Wolverines from 
making the stops they needed to. 
This then translated into a hurried 
Michigan offense that went cold at 
the wrong times.

The 
Wolverines 
went 
on 

three-and-a-half-minute scoring 
droughts in the third and fourth 
quarters, both ended by Ristovski 
— who finished the game with 15 
points and six rebounds.

Meanwhile, sophomore guard 

Katelynn Flaherty led the team 
with 17 points and scored seven of 
Michigan’s last 10 points. But her 
late-game push couldn’t chip away 
enough of the deficit created by a 
big and physical Maryland squad.

“We came out (in the first 

half), and we were scrapping 
and clawing,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We had a ton of hustle plays, 
and then we kind of got worn 
down. That’s kind of attributed 
to a bunch of things, but one is 
definitely Maryland. They really 
wore us down.”

One of those other things that 

contributed to the Wolverines 
running out of gas was their 
eight-hour flight delay yesterday, 
which put the team in bed at 3:30 
a.m. According to Barnes Arico, 
it made her “a little bit nervous” 
coming into the game. But she 
gave credit where credit was 
due in saying Maryland was the 
better team.

“We want to get to (Maryland’s) 

level,” Barnes Arico said. “In the 
first half, we proved that we could 
hang around. Now our next step 
has gotta be putting together a 
complete game.”

SOFTBALL
‘Backside’ program 
helps ‘M’ freshmen

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

Adjusting to college and life 

away from home is difficult for all 
students — even athletes.

Even 
freshman 
Mackenzie 

Nemitz, 
whose 
sister 
Nikki 

was an All-American pitcher at 
Michigan, felt intimidated.

But 
the 
No. 
2 
Michigan 

softball team has something in 
place to combat those feelings of 
loneliness and homesickness. It’s 
called the “backside” program, 
and it has been around for years.

The 
program 
involves 
an 

upperclassman taking a freshman 
teammate 
under 
her 
wing. 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
likens it to having an older or 
younger sister.

“We 
want 
to 
make 
sure 

(freshmen) have a big sister to 
mentor them and to help them 
through,” Hutchins said. “We 
named it the ‘backside’ at one 
point because it’s somebody who 
always has your back, and makes 
sure that you’re pushing yourself 
when you need to.

“When you’re having a tough 

time, they’re there to encourage 
you. More than anything, its 
largest intent was to make sure the 
young kids have somebody that’s 
looking over their shoulder.”

At the annual team picnic, 

the older players are assigned 
an 
incoming 
freshman 
as 

their mentee. From that point 
on, it’s up to the older player 
to introduce herself to the 
freshman when they arrive on 
campus and form a friendship.

Players will check in with 

their “backsides” every so often, 
hang out and generally bond 
with each other.

It’s a surefire way to develop 

team 
chemistry 
and 
create 

lasting relationships.

Nemitz’s backside is senior 

outfielder and captain Olivia 
Richvalsky.

“When I got here, having 

a 
backside 
that 
was 
an 

upperclassman made me feel 
like someone (had) my back even 
though I (had) no idea what was 
going on,” Richvalsky said. “Now 
I feel accountable for one of the 
younger girls on our team and 
that’s really cool.”

The two formed a connection 

quickly, hanging out as soon as 
Nemitz arrived in Ann Arbor, and 
have maintained that friendship 
throughout the year.

“She immediately became my 

older sister,” Nemitz said. “She 
took me to her house. We made 
cookies, did sisterly things and 
she made me really feel welcome 
on the team, especially coming in 
as a freshman. I felt like a part of 
the team very quickly.

“She checks in on me almost 

every day. Like a text, ‘Hey, 
hope you had a good day, see 
you 
at 
practice 
later.’ 
She’s 

really someone that I can go to 
whenever I’m feeling down or 
have a question about anything. 
It’s continued.”

Establishing team chemistry 

is important for a team that has 
seven freshmen, including four 
who played during Michigan’s 
first tournament of the year, and 
the Wolverines appear to have 
done just that with the backside 
program.

“Backsides are the people you 

call when you need something 
quick, you don’t know what to 
do or want someone to hang out 
with,” Richvalsky said before 
laughing. “They have to. They’re 
your backside.”

Marody on the way back from illness

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

As the Michigan hockey team 

left the rink at the conclusion of 
its practice Wednesday, another 
team took the ice — Ann Arbor 
Skyline High School. The Eagles 
had a game that afternoon, 
but 
before 
they 
suited 
up, 

some players and coaches took 
pictures on the edge of the rink.

Little did they know that they 

would get a short speech from 
Michigan 
freshman 
forward 

Cooper Marody.

“I asked them if they’re JV or 

varsity,” Marody said. “And I told 
them I played JV my freshman 
year, so don’t feel like you’re not 
going to be able to make it.”

Earlier this year, it was clear 

Marody had made it himself. 
He wasn’t just another player on 
the roster. He was centering the 
third line and had a hot start to 
the season that landed him first 
on the team in points.

Though 
he 
cooled 
off, 

Marody’s 14 points are still 
good for 10th on the team, and 
he is just eight points short of 
jumping to fourth — behind the 
line of freshman forward Kyle 
Connor and junior forwards 
Tyler Motte and JT Compher — 
in that ranking.

And to the freshman forward, 

much of his early success stems 
from his own ice back home in 
Brighton, Mich.

Roughly 
six 
years 
ago, 

Marody’s father built a rink in 
the family’s backyard at home. 
Now that Marody is in Ann 
Arbor, the ice time has been 
passed down to his little brother. 
But that doesn’t mean he has 
forgotten the days of skating 
alone in his own backyard arena.

“That (rink) is what took 

me to a new level ... being out 
there every day, gaining the 
confidence,” 
Marody 
said. 

“I worked on my hands a lot 
there, worked on a lot of skills. 
That’s how I’ve been able to be 

successful at the higher levels.”

But in the middle of January, 

Marody’s success was quickly 
put on hold when he was 
diagnosed with mononucleosis. 
The freshman has been forced 
to sit every game since the 
Wolverines’ 8-6 win against 
Ohio State on Jan. 17.

Naturally, the nearly month-

long waiting period to get back 
on the ice was frustrating for 
Marody. As if being sidelined 
wasn’t disappointing enough, 
missing out on Michigan’s stellar 
performances 
in 
trademark 

venues made the experience 
even worse.

In 
back-to-back 
weekends, 

Marody was forced to watch 
from home as the Wolverines 
played Penn State in Madison 
Square Garden and Michigan 
State in Joe Louis Arena in the 

“Duel in the D.” Those aren’t 
experiences that come around 
very often.

He was stuck on the outside 

looking 
in, 
as 
Michigan 

continued 
to 

build 
a 
case 

for 
being 

one 
of 
the 

most 
historic 

offenses in the 
past decade of 
college hockey 
— scoring 32 
goals 
in 
the 

seven games he 
missed.

Despite his 

frustration, the time away from 
the ice may have been a blessing 
in disguise for Marody.

“Everything happens for a 

reason — nothing you can do 
about it besides coming back 

stronger,” Marody said.

“When you do something 

every day, you kind of lose how 
cool it is and how special it is. 
I think I gained that back, and 

that’s 
what 

has 
allowed 

me to be so 
successful 
in 

the 
past, 
to 

put that extra 
passion 
(into 

my game).”

Then there’s 

the music — 
another 
area 

into which he 
has put extra 

passion during his time away.

For most people, being sick 

with mononucleosis gives you 
a whole lot of time to sit around 
doing nothing.

While there was some of that 

for Marody, he also put a lot of 
time into schoolwork and playing 
the guitar, something he taught 
himself to do. And Sunday, he 
took it to the next level by starting 
to write his own song.

By Marody’s estimation, it took 

him just 30 minutes to write, and 
yesterday, he produced the final 
product — tweeting the YouTube 
link to the acoustic song.

Now, his Michigan teammates 

are just wondering which one of 
them will get a role in the next 
performance.

“A lot of the guys have made 

jokes about getting featured, 
doing a little bit of background 
singing,” 
Marody 
said. 
“I 

think 
Boo 
would 
be 
good 

to incorporate a little bit of 
drumming in there, because 
he’s a big-time drummer. I don’t 
know about any background 

singing, but I think Boo would 
be good for drums.”

Coming 
down 
with 

mononucleosis also gave Marody 
a unique opportunity to take an 
extended period of time to learn 
from watching his teammates — 
specifically JT Compher.

Compher is about as close 

as Marody can get to a perfect 
example on the Wolverines’ 
roster.

The junior captain centers the 

first line, as Marody did on the 
third, and is second on the team 
in points with 43, good for third 
in the country. That’s without 
mentioning that Compher is 
ranked second nationally in 
assists, trailing leader Tyler 
Kelleher by just two.

But despite all of Compher’s 

eye-popping numbers that are 
largely a product of his finesse 
game, that’s not what stands out 
the most to Marody.

“He’s just a really smart player 

in the first place,” Marody said. 
“I think what really separates 
him is his grittiness and ability 
to stay on guys, win the little 
battles in the corners, all the 
things like that around the zone. 
He’s just relentless all around 
the ice, and I think I really want 
to implement that in my game.”

With Marody set to return to 

game action soon, potentially 
the 
non-conference 
game 

against Ferris State on Friday, 
taking what he has learned and 
translating it into results is a 
likely possibility.

Even with an illness, Marody 

has made the most of every 
minute off the ice as he did on it.

And while he missed the 

celebrity-like thrill of playing 
in the Joe or the “World’s Most 
Famous Arena,” maybe that will 
bode well for Michigan.

Because the next time Marody 

steps in front of crowd at Yost Ice 
Arena, don’t be surprised if you 
see someone playing with the 
passion of a kid in his ice rink 
back home.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Freshman forward Cooper Marody was off to a blazing start to the season before mononucleosis sidelined him. He could return to game action this weekend.

“When you do 
something every 
day, you lose ... 

how special it is.”

Fouls lead to trouble

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

Just 12:50 into the first half 

Tuesday at Ohio State, Michigan 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman committed 
his second foul on guard JaQuan 
Lyle, who drove to the net for 
a layup. As Lyle sank his free 
throw — one of Ohio State’s 17 
during the game — junior guard 
Andrew Dakich replaced Abdur-
Rahkman, who headed to the 
bench for the rest of the half.

Abdur-Rahkman has proven 

to be a sparkplug on the road 
in senior guard Caris LeVert’s 
absence, 
scoring 
15 
and 
16 

points against Penn State and 
Minnesota, respectively, in the 
two away games leading up to 
the matchup with the Buckeyes. 
Though Michigan was trailing by 
eight points, Beilein benched him.

Ohio State (9-5 Big Ten, 

17-10 overall) headed into the 
locker room at halftime with 
an eight-point lead and never 
relinquished its lead thereafter. 
The second half didn’t get any 
better for the Wolverines (9-5, 
19-8), and the Buckeyes cruised 
to a 76-66 victory.

After the game, Beilein said 

he was very tempted to break his 
two-foul benching rule, but he 
stuck by it.

“But again, (the margin) was 

like two or three points with 
two minutes to go,” Beilein said. 
“There’s no reason to say, ‘OK, 
the sky is falling.’ And then they 
scored the last five points to 
make it an eight-point game.

“So you’re not going to put a 

guy in there with a minute left to 
go with two fouls on him. I don’t 
think that was a big difference. 
I’ll do it if I think the game is 
getting out of control. I didn’t 
think it was with two minutes 
to go (until halftime). I thought 
we were right there, and they 
scored the last two times, and 
we didn’t.”

Michigan 
continued 
to 

make 
detrimental 
mistakes, 

committing 14 fouls in the second 
half. For a team that gives 15.7 
fouls per game — the eighth-
fewest in the country — 14 in one 
half is unusual.

Three Wolverines, including 

Abdur-Rahkman, 
ended 
the 

night with four fouls each, and 
they barely escaped the game 
without a player fouling out. 
Michigan is the only team left 
in the country that hasn’t lost a 
player to disqualification.

Junior forward Mark Donnal, 

who flirted with the mark 
against Purdue and Minnesota, 
avoided the bug against Ohio 
State and ended up leading 
Michigan with 17 points on 
6-for-10 shooting.

When asked about defending 

down low, where the Buckeyes 
outscored 
the 
Wolverines, 

38-28, Donnal said Michigan 
needs to improve on getting 
into position.

“A few times, we got too low, 

and when the offense gets into 
position like that, it’s tough 
to stop the run to the basket,” 
Donnal said. “We just have to do 
a better job of staying locked in 
defensively.”

Ohio State shared the ball 

well, leading to a balanced 
offense with five players scoring 
in 
double 
digits, 
partially 

because Michigan couldn’t find 

an effective defense. Man-to-
man defense seemed to lead to 
the most problems, allowing the 
Buckeyes to draw fouls.

Michigan committed six fouls 

in the first five minutes of the 
second half, including two from 
sophomore 
forward 
Aubrey 

Dawkins in a four-second span. 
More fouls often equate to more 
playing time for the bench, and 
in this case, the substitutions 
didn’t 
help 
Michigan 
much. 

The Buckeyes outscored the 
Wolverines in bench points, 20-9.

The largest deficit was 14 

points with 12:08 remaining in 
the second half, just moments 
after Ohio State reached the 
bonus with its seventh foul.

Michigan seemed to chalk up 

the loss to a mix of fatigue and 
an emotional rollercoaster of a 
week, with a win at Minnesota 
and a victory over then-No. 18 
Purdue at home. Regardless, the 
Wolverines were out of sorts, and 
it was noticeable.

“We just gotta bring it every 

game,” Donnal said. “We had a 
chip on our shoulder for the game 
at Purdue, and unfortunately, we 
just didn’t bring it tonight.”

Bakich focuses on gratitude 
for Michigan’s support staff

Fourth-year coach 
has success with 
staff he brought 
from Maryland

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

At the Michigan baseball 

team’s banquet Friday, Michigan 
head coach Erik Bakich spent 
45 
minutes 
introducing 
his 

entire staff. Everyone, from 
the 
groundskeepers 
to 
the 

nutritionist to the parents to 
the 
student 
managers, 
was 

personally thanked. 

Bakich is in his fourth season 

at the helm of the program, aided 
by assistant coaches Sean Kenny 
and Nick Schnabel and volunteer 
assistant coach Aaron Etchison. 

“(The coaches) made it a 

precedent to make a structural 
foundation for a new program 
at Michigan,” said senior left-
hander Evan Hill. “One that 
doesn’t only look at the aspects 
of baseball, but it looks at the 
aspects of life and for us as men. 
One thing that I appreciate in 
my time here is that I’ve become 
a better man. I’ve developed a 
lot. And, more specifically, I’m 
excited about the relationships 
I’ve built and know that they’ll 
be lasting ones.” 

Sophomore 
infielder 
Jake 

Bivens, who received several 
preseason accolades after his 
impressive 
freshman 
year, 

also felt the coaching staff was 
helpful — especially by relieving 
pressure 
that 
preseason 

expectations brought on.

“We have a really talented 

team,” Bivens said. “So that takes 
the pressure off of (individual 
players) and allows us to not play 
out of our comfort zone and our 
abilities. The team and coaching 
staff prepared us well for any 
accolades. We know any individual 
accolade is a team accolade.”

In 2014, Bakich’s first year, the 

team had a total of 29 wins and 

a 14-10 record in the Big Ten — 
good enough to tie for fifth place. 
The second year of Bakich’s reign 
saw the team win 30 games, 
finishing in a tie for fourth place 
in the Big Ten. In the 2015 season, 
the Wolverines continued their 
upward trend and then some, 
finishing with 39 wins and placed 
second in the NCAA Louisville 
Regional after winning the Big 
Ten Tournament. 

Bakich is also the youngest 

head baseball coach in the 
conference.

“We live in a gratitude zone,” 

Bakich 
said. 
“(The 
players) 

say simple ‘thank yous’ all the 
time, just like they should. 
(The staffers) 
sometimes 
have 
a 
job 

that could be 
thankless, but 
our team — this 
team — is very 
appreciative.”

Adding 
on 

to the lengthy 
speech, 
Bakich 
then 

spent another 
10 minutes on his coaching staff. 

He, along with Etchison and 

pitching coach Kenny, came to 
Michigan from the University 
of 
Maryland. 
Etchison 
was 

a former catcher and Kenny 
served as the pitching coach.

“(Etchison) is an outstanding 

player, and now has become an 
outstanding leader,” Bakich said. 
“He’s destined for greatness.” 

Kenny, 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 

native, 
followed 
Bakich’s 

trend of improving the team 
significantly each year. In 2014, 
the pitching staff finished third 
in the league, but in 2015, Kenny 
led the team to second in the Big 
Ten with 513 strikeouts. 

“He’s the best at coaching 

(pitchers) 
in 
the 
country,” 

Bakich said. “That’s not just 
my biased opinion. There’s a lot 
of people who think he’s in an 
elite group of pitching. Other 
programs around the country 
have tried to steal this guy, but 

Michigan — so he’s said — is the 
big leagues. We’re so lucky to 
have his talents and to have the 
type of person he is on our staff.”

The final coach, Schnabel, 

might not have traveled to Ann 
Arbor from College Park, but 
he was a teammate of Bakich at 
East Carolina in the 1999 and 
2000 seasons. Schnabel, like 
the others, contributes to the 
team’s success. In his first year 
as recruiting coordinator, he 
was credited with the 20th-best 
recruiting class in the nation. 

But 
it 
was 
32 
Michigan 

players who won the 2015 Big 
Ten Tournament.

It was the athletes who 

walked out of 
the 
bullpen 

and onto the 
diamond. 
It 

was 
then-

sophomore 
left-hander 
Brett Adcock 
who struck out 
four 
batters 

and 
allowed 

two hits and 
a run in five 

innings. It was his classmate, 
infielder Johnny Slater, who 
had two hits, out of the team’s 
four total, against Maryland. 
And it was then-junior Jacob 
Cronenworth who closed out his 
fourth straight game, pushing 
the Wolverines to the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since 2008. 

But nobody, especially the 

players, forgot the coaching staff 
that got them there.

When 
the 
players 
walk 

onto the field Friday for their 
season opener, all eyes will be 
on them. But the athletes’ eyes, 
when they’re not staring down 
a 90-mph fastball, will be on 
their coaches.

“The voodoo priest and all his 

powders were as nothing com-
pared to espresso, cappuccino, and 
mocha, which are stronger than 
all the religions of the world com-
bined, and perhaps stronger than 
the human soul itself.”

— Mark Helprin, “Memoir 

from Antproof Case” (1995)

Thanks be to coffee, the sweet 

life-sustaining stimulant. Wher-
ever the coffee lover falls on the 
spectrum — addict, health-freak 
or simply in it for the cat cafés 
— from cold brews to cortados, 
there is no beverage more ubiq-
uitous or more versatile. The 
cornerstone of cafés elevates 
spirits and tiramisu, enables the 
nocturnal writer, electrifies the 
early bird and even gives the 
fidgeter something to do with 
their hands on a first date.

If 
there’s 
anything 
Ann 

Arborites love more than a Zing-
erman’s sandwich or football Sat-
urdays, it’s coffee. Yet attempting 
to navigate the murky waters of 
Tree Town’s coffee culture is no 
easy feat. There’s a corporate 
chain lurking around most major 
street corners, a few hometown 
hotspots and plenty of student-
ridden dives; and then there’s 
Mighty Good Coffee, with three 
locations scattered throughout 
the city.

Thanks be to coffee, but first, 

thanks be to goats.

850 C.E.: Legend has it that 

coffee was discovered in Ethio-
pia by a goat herder named Kaldi. 
Following a berry bush snack 
break, his herd was bright-eyed 
and bushy-tailed as ever and 
he wanted in on the bliss. After 
sampling some berries, Kaldi, 
too, took a turn for the chipper. 
He then prescribed his ener-
gizing remedy to a narcoleptic 
monk who often dozed off during 
services. The monk got creative, 
brewing the berries into liquid 
form and soon swore by their 
pious properties. Word travelled 
fast, and the caffeinated creation 
quickly became a staple for the 
devout and pagan alike … and so 
it remains.

2006: Commercial photogra-

pher David Myers is searching 
for a break from his day-to-day 
life. After brainstorming a new 
career path and rekindling with a 
friend who had failed in his cof-
fee venture, Myers finally decides 
to pursue the business of beans 
and brews. He purchases all of 
his friend’s equipment and begins 
roasting part time, eventually 
constructing a small starter café 
on Main Street in 2009. They 
soon outgrow the compact cof-
feehouse and decide to relocate 
to an open space just down the 
street. Fast forward a year, and 
Mighty Good Coffee is born.

Last week I strolled into the 

eclectic café’s Main Street loca-
tion to talk all things really good 
and caffeinated with Myers. 
As current co-owner, a title he 
shares with longtime friend Jim 
Levinsohn, Myers spends most 
of his days focused on the coffee 
itself — where to buy and from 
whom. The Mighty Good philos-
ophy is simple: sourcing quality 
coffee from people they’ve met 
and farms they’ve stood on.

“The cool thing about cof-

fee is that I can talk to the per-
son who’s growing the coffee,” 
Myers said. “I can talk to the 
person who’s drinking that same 
coffee, and everyone in between. 
It’s about the chain of people 
connected in the coffee industry, 
and that’s a worldwide connec-
tion of people.”

During his most recent busi-

ness trip, Myers and a barista 
travelled to Columbia and visited 
11 farms over a few days. The duo 
toured farms by Jeep, foot and 
even horseback for an inside look 
at coffee production.

“We go walk on farms and see 

how they’re producing and what 
their coffee tastes like,” Myers 
said. “We rely on trust when we 
buy our coffee.”

All of Mighty Good’s Colum-

bian coffee is purchased from a 
partnership mill — an alliance 
between a U.S. company and a 
Columbian family — in the city 
of Hardin. According to Myers, 
the mill buys the best coffee from 
surrounding farms in the area. 

Along with the ever-popular 
Columbian brews, the café sourc-
es a majority of the beans from 
Guatemala and Sumatra.

“I spend a lot of time inter-

acting and meeting with people 
from the broader coffee commu-
nity around the U.S. and inter-
nationally because that’s what 
coffee does, and it’s more unique 
than a lot of other industries,” 
Myers said.

Two to three times per year, 

Myers attends events hosted by 
the Specialty Coffee Associa-
tion of America (SCAA) where 
he educates newbies and con-
noisseurs alike on the craft. This 
April he’s set to teach roasting 
classes at the Atlanta, Ga. con-
vention. Myers also routinely 
attends Barista Camps — events 
hosted four times per year, dur-
ing which baristas from around 
the country exchange tricks of 
the trade.

“It’s just a collection of people 

driven to improve their craft,” 
Myers said. “Everyone from 
beginners driven to open coffee 
shops, or those sent by their com-
panies.”

Along with fostering national 

and international relationships 
within the coffee community, 
the café also maintains a focus on 
local involvement. Mighty Good 
was approached by both Blank 
Slate Creamery and the Ann 
Arbor Distillery, which are now 
its current collaborators — their 
brew gives Blank Slate’s coffee 
ice cream its essential flavor and 
their cold brew is crucial to the 
distillery’s coffee liqueur. Special 
collaborations within the city are 
Myers’s preferred projects.

“We focus on what we do and 

the law of attraction seems to 
work in our favor,” Myers said. 
“You can get a great cup of cof-
fee in a lot of places in Ann Arbor 
and a lot of places around the 
country, but it’s about what kind 
of community we build and how 
we interact with our community 
that I think really drives what we 
are about.”

Though Myers refrains from 

any sort of push-marketing, 
assuring me he’ll never “be out 
on Ann Arbor street-corners 
blowing 
the 
Mighty 
Good 

horn,” the coffee shop is wildly 
popular — particularly for its 
brown sugar sea salt latte, an 
original creation.

“We came up with it four or 

five years ago,” Myers said. “It’s 
probably the most successful 
drink we’ve ever come up with. 
We make that all from scratch; 
everything we make here is 
from scratch.”

Among 
their 
scratch 

creations are slow jams, butters 
and 
apple 
compote. 
Other 

gourmet innovations include 
their unique adaptations of 
nitro cold brew and continually 
trending 
toast 
bars 
— 
my 

personal recommendation is 
the brie and apple compote 
toast; upon first bite I was 
weak, in love, crying, etc.

“I’d been looking at toast 

bars for a long time, ever since 
I started reading about them 
in San Francisco,” Myers said. 
“We started it here maybe a 
year or two ago and it was slow 
to pick up, but it’s really popular 
now.”

Mighty Good aims to provide 

as many local ingredients as 
possible. Bread and Sunday 
pastries come from Detroit’s 
Avalon Bakery, Tasty Bakery 
provides gluten-free treats and 
the Pastry Peddler supplies 
their beloved baked goods. 
Despite offering a diverse food 
menu, Myers regards the noms 
as secondary to the coffee.

“We’re careful not to dilute 

that we’re a coffee shop and 
that food has to complement 
that, not be who we become,” 
he said.

During the coffee shop’s 

infancy 
and 
original 
menu 

development, they offered only 
brewed coffee and flavorless 
lattes. Myers refers to the 
sparse drink menu days as 
the 
cafe’s 
“purist 
track.” 

Eventually, a barista mixed 
flavors from scratch on her own 
time and assembled a book of 
her creations. She presented 
her ideas to Myers, the staff 
chose five of them to sample 
and eventually narrowed it 
down to a few, which remain 
behind the bar.

“Any development is the 

work of collective intelligence,” 
Myers said. “It’s a way better 
way to work when everyone’s 
involved.”

The 
team-inclusive 
menu 

amendments typically occur 
with 
the 
changing 
of 
the 

seasons. The honey lavender 
latte, 
for 
example, 
was 
a 

springtime addition.

“At the end of the day, we’re 

coffee snobs to ourselves, but 
not to our customers,” Myers 
said.

Besides the fueling function 

of 
caffeine, 
Myers 
stays 

motivated by the creativity of 
the coffee industry, one that 
harkens back his memories 
of art school. He missed the 
artistic 
craftsmanship 
that 

once seemed a relic of a bygone 
era, but rediscovered it through 
the medium of coffee.

“When I was in art school I 

was doing hands-on craftwork,” 
Myers said. “Computers took 
over 
and 
digital 
art 
took 

over. The pace of everything 
compressed, so your output was 
more important than the craft 
of what you were doing and I 
missed that. This is more like 
what I went to art school for — 
it’s a craft business.”

But when he was plotting a 

career shift 10 years ago, Myers 
couldn’t foresee Mighty Good’s 
trajectory. What were once 
spreadsheet business goals as 
part of a 10-year plan quickly 
became realities within a few 
years.

“Ten years ago I wasn’t 

thinking about any of this, I 
was just figuring out how to 
start a business that could turn 
into something,” he said. “Now 
that I have an opportunity to 
do something for the people 
who work here and people in 
the community. Now it’s, like, 
how can I create stable jobs for 
people? How can I maintain 
our core business and not screw 
that up? How can I do more 
community involvement?”

When he’s not pondering 

Mighty Good’s progress or 
future projects, Myers makes 
a point to stop in the Main 
Street shop whenever he can — 
occasionally making himself a 
specialty drink or sipping black 
coffee, his drink of choice. 
During my visit on Valentine’s 
Day, he was waiting on a heart-
etched latte to Instagram.

Maybe it was his passion 

for the work talking, or the 
fact that his wife was working 
alongside him that day, but 
Myers divulged the best way to 
take your coffee.

“Just 
sharing 
it 
with 

someone. That’s a fantastic way 
to drink coffee every day.”

Angela Flournoy writes 

about topics ranging from 
haunted houses and real estate 
prices to 
the Great 
Migration 
and not-
so-great 
marriages. 
While not 
everything 
in her novel, 
“The Turner 
House,” may 
be familiar 
to readers at 
the Univer-
sity of Mich-
igan, most of 
it probably 
should be. 
After all, 
it takes place just down the 
freeway, weaving in and out 
of Detroit and its suburbs and 
finding a home on the fictional 
Yarrow Street.

The up-and-coming young 

writer will read from her debut 
novel at 5:30 p.m. Thursday as 
part of the Zell Writers Series 
at UMMA’s Helmut Stern Audi-
torium. Following her talk, she 
will be available to sign copies 
of the book, which emerged as 
an instant classic in 2015.

Heralded by major literary 

and news sources as one of the 
most promising new novelists 
of her day, Flournoy tells the 
story of 20th-century Detroit 
through the lens of the Turner 
family and their ups and downs 
— mirroring the city’s convul-
sions, shifts and changes.

As the state of Detroit has 

become more of a national 
issue, the facts and figures of 
urban decay in the city have 

become familiar, cited in 
everything from documentary 
films to political debates.

“There’s value in ‘macro’ 

kind of analysis because that’s 
how you find about trends and 
how things are happening on 
a large scale,” Flournoy said 
in a recent interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

But this singular focus left 

the human element out of the 
narrative completely.

“Most of it was non-fiction,” 

she said. “So it was like, ‘This 
is how many people lived here 
in 1947, how many people were 
here in 1978, etc.’ ”

Putting faces and relatable 

stories to the city’s decline was 
something Flournoy hoped 
would bring Detroit home for 
her readers.

“I read those books, and it 

was useful. But what was more 
useful was to imagine, ‘What 
does it actually feel like?’ ” she 
said. “The value of fiction is that 
it can make numbers come to 
life, because if you focus on the 
very, very particular of indi-
vidual people, you really look at 
something from the inside out.”

Flournoy’s extensive research 

and intuitive understanding of 
the city’s varied perspectives 
enriches her writing. But so did 
her point of view as an outsider. 
She grew up in Los Angeles, 
a city with some of the same 
strengths and problems, but 
also a very different atmosphere 
than the Motor City.

“For me, it was actually really 

exciting to write about a place 
that I had not lived, but that I 
had some experience with,” she 
said. “I think that for writers 
sometimes, the thing that is 
closest to your own experience 
is the thing that you don’t really 
have the right perspective to 

write about because you want 
to be loyal to what really hap-
pened. You have to figure out 
something that you’re familiar 
with, that you have an under-
standing of, but where there’s 
room to still explore and dis-
cover new things.”

As Flournoy’s work spans 

decades of American history, 
her life now zigzags the country 
as book tours, family and work 
pull her in different directions. 
The LA native teaches in New 
York City at Columbia Univer-
sity and The New School, when 
she’s not meeting fans of “The 
Turner House” all over the 
United States. What little free 
time she has is devoted to writ-
ing, a schedule that she finds 
challenging and inspiring at 
the same time.

“I actually think that the 

busier I am, the more excited 
I am to write,” Flournoy said. 
“Then the next part of that 
puzzle, though, is actually find-
ing the time. But I am slowly 
putting together the ideas, 
and some early, early pages of 
something new.”

New work and research will 

undoubtedly pull her into yet 
another community, captur-
ing its sense of place and indi-
vidual details with razor-sharp 
insight. But Flournoy will 
always keep a little space for 
Detroit, the inspiration for the 
novel that launched her career. 
Some Detroiters seem to think 
she’ll keep that inspiration, too.

“The most rewarding part 

of the process is, especially 
when I’m in Detroit, and I hear 
people say, ‘This is a book that 
feels like Detroit,’” she said. 
“That’s really your goal as a fic-
tion writer ... that’s what you’re 
trying to do.”

EPISODE REVIEW

Now in season 41, “Saturday 

Night Live” is like your cool old 
grandpa: sometimes cringe-
worthy, but ultimately still 
kicking and 
keeping up 
with the kids.

On this 

week’s 
episode, 
hosted by 
Melissa 
McCarthy 
(promoting 
her new 
movie, “The 
Boss”) and 
rapper Kanye West, the highlight 
of the show was the spoof movie 
trailer called “The Day Beyoncé 
Turned Black.” Created in 
response to last week’s media 
uproar about Beyoncé’s music 

video for “Formation” — the 
video hints at police brutality and 
the Black Lives Matter movement 
— the “SNL” trailer mocks “the 
day white people never saw 
coming,” as if Beyoncé’s race 
revelation is a disaster movie. 
There’s fire in the streets, 
cubicles collapsing and an office 
worker crying in agony, “I got a 
hot sauce in my bag, swag ... What 
does that mean?” (It means that 
everyone should seriously settle 
down about Queen Bey’s artistic 
choices.)

Keeping up the theme of music 

superstars, another pitch-perfect 
skit was “Kyle v. Kanye,” where 
Kyle Mooney of “SNL” challenges 
Kanye to a rap battle. Mooney is 
serious about it, too — he tells a 
dramatic backstory of his dream 
to be the best rapper alive, rather 

than just a “heartthrob on the 
rise” — and if he can out-rap 
Kanye, his dreams will come 
true.

Unfortunately, Mooney’s best 

rhyme is “Kanye West, you need 
a mint for your Kanye breath,” 
and Kanye crushes him. But like 
most “SNL” skits, the humor’s in 
miscommunication: after their 
showdown, Mooney confesses, 
“That was the biggest mistake of 
my life ... I just destroyed Kanye 
in a rap battle and now he’s 
probably really sad.”

Onstage, McCarthy’s 

monologue was forgettable, but 
Leslie Jones slayed Weekend 
Update by describing her perfect 
valentine, giving hope to picky 
singles everywhere. Cheers to 
love, rap and Queen Bey.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

By JOEY SCHUMAN

For the Daily

It’s not that ridiculous to label 

Kanye West as the best musi-
cian ever. His creative potential 
knows no boundaries, his flow 
knows no hesitation and his ego 
knows no flaws. His status seems 
bulletproof. But in honor of the 
release of The Life of Pablo, his sev-
enth solo studio album, it seems 
appropriate to take a look at a 
crucial, uninvestigated issue: just 
how playable is Kanye at bar/bat 
mitzvahs? We know Kanye can 
hold the summer down, but can 
he hold down the basement of the 
local Doubletree hotel on Satur-
day nights from 6:30-10:30? Let’s 
speculate.

Any bar mitzvah vet knows 

the night starts off with some 
speeches from friends. No doubt 
the spotlight is on the bar mitzvee 
during this time, but at least a 
little background music is needed 
to distract from the revolving 
panel of pre-pubescent hypes. 
Enter “Runaway,” off Kanye’s 
2010 masterpiece, My Beautiful 
Dark Twisted Fantasy. Now’s the 
time to forget all those bro fights 
over the Xbox — all douchebags, 
assholes and scumbags are forgiv-
en here. Introspective, apologetic 
and triumphant, the record per-
fectly encapsulates the emotions 
of the made-for-Insta moment.

After a routine game of “Coke 

& Pepsi,” it’s time for the grand 
entrance. And is there any better 
soundtrack for the moment than 
“Touch the Sky?” The schmoozing 
is over, the Torah has been read 

and the challah has been blessed. 
This moment calls for self-admi-
ration, and ’Ye’s 2005 hit serves 
as the ultimate mazel tov.

Now it’s time for the real 

party to start, which is where it 
gets tricky. Kanye has bonafide 
bangers, there’s no doubt about 
that, but what the party needs 
most are kid-friendly bangers, 
the type of banger you’d feel com-
fortable playing with your Rabbi 
in attendance. This methodology 
eliminates “Blood on the Leaves” 
(lots of Molly references) and 
“N****s in Paris” (self-explana-
tory), thus spurring a fallback to 
more appropriate classics such as 
“Stronger” and “Gold Digger.” In 
a room with such a broad range 
of personality, time-tested jams 
prove both versatile and nostal-
gic.

The adults want to turn up as 

well, and during the kids’ dinner 
break “Slow Jamz” seems like the 
perfect answer to that. The song, 
with its soulful tone and refer-
ences to Marvin Gaye, Luther 
Vandross and Anita Baker, is 
most likely to resonate most with 
the 40-and-over crowd. It’s really 
just a desperate grasp to play 
classic-sounding shit in the hopes 
that old people like it.

Soon, everyone realizes that 

old people can’t really dance, the 
catered chicken nuggets are way 
too rubbery, the seating arrange-
ment is pretty awkward and 
the seventh graders are way too 
hormonal to be dealing with any 
of this. Besides, is anyone feeling 
the love? It’s time for the Snow-
ball, and one overly-Old Spiced 

bar mitzvah boy is ready to make 
his first pick, something that 
he totally hasn’t been thinking 
about for weeks. Cue up “Devil 
in a New Dress” to set the mood. 
For everything the dude is too 
awkward to say, Kanye is there: 
“Put your hands to the constel-
lations / the way you look should 
be a sin, you my sensation.” ’Ye 
inserts a bit of romanticism into 
a situation that clearly needs it. 
He plays matchmaker with his 
intimate bars. Who knows? If the 
lucky lady is Jewish, she could be 
a keeper.

Enough with the young love, 

though. The first notes of “Hava 
Nagila” ring out, and that means 
it’s time for the Horah, a Jewish 
dance traditionally done during 
joyous times. When it’s time for 
bar mitzvah boy to be hoisted, 
“Celebration,” a fun jam off Late 
Registration (2005) takes over 
the speakers. Mr. West knows 
how to set the mood, and this one 
is of regality and commemora-
tion. Grab a drink, grab a glass of 
Manischewitz. Everyone in atten-
dance needs to know what this is. 
It’s a celebration, bitches.

Following all of the mishigas, 

the giveaway is distributed and 
regular sweatpants appear to be 
the move over joggers. Such a dis-
appointment is the most tangible 
evidence to all fuccbois in atten-
dance that it’s time to go home.

“I Am a God” plays on the way 

out. Rites of passage! Emotions! 
Yeezus! His divine influence 
transcends religion. His holy 
music defies traditional strictures. 
L’chaim, indeed.

Kanye at my mitzvah

“Worst bar mitzvah ever.”

KANYE WEEK

COFFEE
From Page 1B

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

For me, 2016 is the year of the 

singer/songwriters. After spend-
ing most of the last few months 
listening to “Hamilton” on repeat 
(allowing for a small break to 
learn all the words to Adele’s 25, 
of course), I have missed many 
of the major musical movements. 
(Try saying that five times fast.) 
Now that I am emerging from my 
Lin-Manuel Miranda-induced 
haze, I finally have ears for some-
thing other than “Satisfied” and 
“Aaron Burr, Sir.”

At the forefront of this new 

movement in my life is Evan 
Blum. While there’s very little 
available information on Blum 
himself, I know he has very few 
Spotify followers, no website 
other than his YouTube homep-
age and no active Twitter to 
speak of. His musical style ranges 
from acoustic to electronica, yet 
remains extremely self-reflective 
and lyric-based without sounding 
overdone.

Blum’s debut album, Cloudy 

Head, was released in 2015 and 
contains seven songs, each of 
which utilize their own style 
and genre to create a diverse, yet 
cohesive lineup. Opening with 
“Everyone’s Got a Story,” Blum 
channels his inner-Mat Kearney 
with echoing vocals and a rap 

verse that criticizes society’s 
perceptions of people. Blum is 
aware of other’s struggles and 
notes that, “I cannot judge when 
I know so little.” It is a reminder 
that even in a divisive and judg-
mental culture, it is important to 
be cognizant of everyone’s dif-
ficulties.

“Two Girls” is a steady, guitar-

based song with a heavy bass. 
No major swells make it either 
boring or soothing depending on 
your perspective, but the search-
ing and questioning lyrics, “What 
about all the plans we made 
together?” hope to find a lost love. 
Switching gears, “See Where It 
Goes” starts with featured artist 
Katherine Eva ethereally vocaliz-
ing before bringing in elements of 
light electronica such as syntheti-
cally produced sounds. Eva and 
Blum’s harmonies are light and 
airy, asking again, “Is it too soon? 
/ Is it too fast? / Is it too much? / 
Can we make it last?”

“Growing Up” brings back 

the electronic vibes again and 
soothes the previous song’s ques-
tions, reassuring that as we grow 
older some things will change 
and some will not. Blum sings, 
“Baby, baby, tell me it’s alright / 
We’re gonna be okay.” Bringing 
out a heavier beat, Latin-flared 
guitar and quick syncopation, 
“Down to Your Street” is seduc-
tive and quick-witted with echo-

ing and smooth vocals crooning, 
“Baby, it’s simple / Roll down the 
window / Crank up the bass real 
loud.”

The first song of Blum’s I lis-

tened to, and also my favorite 
from the album, was “Some-
body.” Reminiscent of Andy 
Grammer, the recurring, simple 
piano tune and internal rhymes 
only serve to emphasize Blum’s 
talent as a songwriter. It brings 
the story Cloudy Head has been 
telling to a close, urging some-
one to “Tell her that I love her / 
Tell her that I need her tonight.”

The closing song, “Someone 

for Sam” describes a man named 
Sam by listing his characteris-
tics, but in doing so, creates a 
persona that we can all relate to. 
The final lyrics are poignant and 
intrinsically reflective, musing, 
“I heard there’s a fish in the sea 
for everyone / Just swimming 
around feeling sad and blue / 
But if those fish only knew / Sam 
feels lonely too.”

Evan Blum may be an 

unknown singer/songwriter, but 
the universality of emotions and 
situations described throughout 
Cloudy Head allow everyone to 
take a piece of the music with 
them. Jam-packed in just seven 
songs, Blum does what many 
struggle to do in half the time — 
he connects with his listeners 
and sends them away changed.

Up and coming Evan 
Blum worth a listen

An ode to coffee

SINGLE REVIEW

 OK, let’s talk about Gwen 
Stefani — because everyone 
should be. 
Her live 
music video 
during the 
Grammys 
(the first of 
its kind) was 
a brightly 
colored bea-
con of hope 
for continued 
experimentation in popular 
music — an idea the Grammys 
increasingly suffocate with 
each year’s ceremony.
 Stefani has always been a sin-
gular character in pop music; 
her vocals — equal parts growl 
and smooth pouting — have 
allowed her to successfully 
front No Doubt and embark on 
extremely successful pop solo 
projects as well. Her newest, 
“Make Me Like You,” is the 
song no one knew they needed. 
I once touched Gwen Stefani’s 
shoulder during her Sweet 
Escape tour in the fifth grade 
(was trampled by a vegan mom 
moments after), and this is just 

the track to prove we are for-
ever connected. She’s got her 
new beau Blake and I have my 
first-ever real person date this 
week. She’s unapologetically 
and simultaneously confused, 
frustrated, excited and grate-
ful. So am I, and I think most 
people experience a (hopefully) 
healthy mixture of the afore-
mentioned.
 The track doesn’t bring any 
revelations or real solutions to 
the feelings, but the lyrics are 

catchy without leaning towards 
the tepidity of much of today’s 
pop music; the individual beats 
and instruments blend to form 
well-oiled production over 
which Stefani frosts her laid-
back lyrics, completing this 
sweet, sweet pop tune. 2016 
was first supposed to be about 
Rihanna, then about Beyoncé, 
and, now, Kanye, but Stefani 
Season may be just around the 
corner.

The nectar of the 
gods is my life, and 

I’m fine with it

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

You know that feeling of 

excitement you get when the 
month of September strikes, and 
Pumpkin Spice everything finally 
comes out, and all you can do is 
sigh in sweet relief because that 
beautiful nectar of the gods is 
about to touch your lips? And 
then your taste buds wake up to 
the fact that school is starting 
again and the fact that another 
year of your life is coming to a 
close gets washed away because 
the only thought in your head 
at that specific moment is: “Hell 
frickin’ yes. I’ve waited so long. 
TYBG.” And the smooth warm 
coffee travels down your throat 
and almost gives you a sense of 
purpose for about .2 seconds? 
Well, that’s kind of how I feel 
about regular coffee. Which is 
why I have to drink it all of the 
time.

Aside from the fact that I get 

caffeine withdrawal headaches 
because I’ve cultivated a depen-
dency on this gnarly liquid, I 
drink coffee because I like the 
taste. It’s usually a hit or a miss 
for people, but when my mom let 
me taste a tiny sip of this stuff so I 
could feel like a “big girl” when I 
was about seven, it hit me like the 
smell of weed in East Quad. I just 
wanted to keep tasting it forever. 
And when I finally turned 14, I 
was allowed to drink it whenever 
I pleased.

So I did what any rational 

teenage girl would do and I 
decided to drink it more or less 
whenever I was able to. I drank it 
when I woke up. I drank it dur-
ing school (because let’s face it, I 
wouldn’t have survived that hell 
hole without something altering 
my perspective somehow). And I 
drank it when I would hang out 
with my friends. Coffee wasn’t 
always invited to hang out, but 
with a lack of things to do and its 
availability at anytime and any-
where, it found its way into the 
picture 10 times out of 10.

It’s because coffee is so uni-

versal. It works as an alarm 
clock. It provides motivation to 
do homework, to study or to just 
be a human being. It’s an excuse 
for a first date. It’s a conversa-
tion starter. Drinking it can be an 
act of relaxation or stimulation. 
And you can drink it any way 
you want: black, with sugar and 
cream, cold, hot, in the form of 
a slurpee. Do you like chocolate, 
vanilla, and hazelnut? Throw 
that shit in there and I promise 
you it will work out. It will still 
taste wonderful.

When I was in the primary 

stage of my addiction I liked my 
coffee sweetened with French 
Vanilla 
Coffee 
Mate 
*insert 

heart eyes emoji here* but as I’ve 
grown in to the better version of 
myself, I prefer it almost black. I 
don’t need anything extravagant. 

I just need it simple, like my per-
sonality. And I don’t mean that in 
a boring way. I’m far from boring 
— or at least I would hope so — I 
mean it in an I-genuinely-enjoy-
the-smaller-things-in-life 
kind 

of way.

But then there’s the abso-

lute best cup of coffee you could 
ever gift yourself with: diner 
coffee. You know what I’m talk-
ing about. It’s 2 in the morning 
and under circumstances you 
can’t explain you’re sitting in 
that 24-hour rinky-dink diner 
that’s only known by its acronym. 
You’ve been here far too many 
times to count and across from 
you is a person who you don’t 
exactly mind sharing every piece 
of nonsense in your brain with.

The walls are permanently 

stained yellow because they 
haven’t been re-painted since 
before smoking in a restaurant 
was banned in every state. The 
same waitress who you’ve seen 
each time you walk in is pour-
ing you your cup of sanity. She 
was there before you could drive, 
before you went away to school, 
before you even became your 
own person. You ask her how her 
kids have been. “How’s your hus-
band?” you say. She says “Oh you 
know, same as always.” You both 
share a laugh because you know 
exactly what she means. You’ve 
shared a few cups of the same 
coffee she pours for other people 
because you happened to be there 
on her a break a few times. You 
make sure that even though the 
coffee is only $1.06, you tip her 4 
dollars or more because her kind-
ness is genuine and she always 
refills your cup.

She refills it so frequently 

that after two hours of being 
completely immersed in this 
conversation about how life has 
been changing with your friend, 
you notice your hand is shaking. 
You’ve probably had more than 
four cups now and you’re just 
now realizing it. But, you don’t 
mind.

See, to even be in this circum-

stance you have to be on some sort 
of break from real life. Whether 
that be a holiday break, sum-
mer or even nothing more than 
a weekend, you’re just sitting on 
that pleather seat not worrying 
about anything else. The coffee 
aroma wraps you like a blan-
ket and you’re living life how it 
was meant to be lived: leisurely. 
Enjoying every sip that prevents 
unnecessary meaningless word 
vomit while creating some sort of 
punctuality to every one of your 
syllables. Enjoying your friend’s 
company. Enjoying the familiari-
ty of everything around you. And 
then the nostalgia hits you.

And all of these events, all of 

these people I’ve encountered 
out of pure chance in my life are 
shoved into the front of brain 
just by one sip of that plain black 
diner coffee.

It tastes bitter, reminding me 

of how I felt the night everything 
fell apart and I sat in my booth 
for hours. It feels hot, reminding 
me of the sticky summer nights I 
spent on the wire chairs outside. 

It gives me tranquility, reminding 
me of the days I’ve witnessed the 
sunrise through the windows. It 
goes down smooth, reminding 
me of things that don’t and of the 
people who never were.

The people who had sharp 

edges like the table at booth num-
ber 3. After countless conversa-
tions and after countless cups 
of boiling hot coffee, I watched 
their edges melt. And I melted 
too. I melted into that pleather 
seat. I melted into those people. I 
melted into my cup of sheer sanc-
tuary.

Maybe I am too fascinated 

with coffee. Maybe it’s just an 
utter coincidence that a lot of my 
favorite people have been poured 
out of a pot. Maybe I just sound 
crazy placing this much empha-
sis on a beverage. Maybe this is 
all because I haven’t had enough 
coffee today.

Here’s the thing, I tend to get 

complacent without my fix of 
caffeine. Irritable. Tired. I start 
melting into the wrong places, 
and everything I do is slightly 
off. I can’t empathize with peo-
ple who don’t drink it all of the 
time. It helps me function as a 
normal human being in society. 
It’s become a personality trait 
of mine. Hey, I’m Selena. I drink 
so much coffee that I have self-
induced insomnia now, but it’s 
fine because I can drink more cof-
fee to help with that issue. If you 
don’t drink coffee, I don’t know 
what we’ll do together because 
one-hundred percent of the time I 
will want to be drinking coffee or 
doing something that involves get-
ting coffee and talking about what 
molded you into the human being 
you have become.

When I’m having a bad day, 

I can drink some coffee about 
it and it will instantly be better. 
Failed that test? Drank some cof-
fee about it. Got three hours of 
sleep? Drank some coffee about 
it. The boy I’m in love with kissed 
my best friend? Drank a lot of 
coffee about it. Needed to finish a 
paper? Drank some coffee about 
it. Needed to finish this article? 
I am currently drinking coffee 
about it.

Coffee is my ideal go-to for 

anything if you haven’t been able 
to tell. And I think that’s how it 
always will be. I will encounter 
more lovely humans through the 
steam that floats off a fresh cup. 
My future apartment will always 
smell like coffee. I will have the 
best coffee mug collection a per-
son could ever lay their eyes on 
because besides wanting a dog, 
having a great coffee mug collec-
tion is my only goal in life.

So if I’m ever mean to you, I 

haven’t had my coffee yet. If I’m 
ever sad, I haven’t had my coffee 
yet. If I’m annoyed, tired, quiet or 
dull, I haven’t had my coffee yet. 
If I have no interest in our con-
versation, it’s because I’m think-

This weekend, the School of 

Music, Theater & Dance pres-
ents Bruce Norris’ “Clybourne 
Park,” a spin-
off to the well-
known “A 
Raisin in the 
Sun” by Lor-
raine Hans-
berry.

This play 

first appeared 
Off Broadway 
at Playwrights 
Horizons 
in February 
2010. Fol-
lowing its 
opening, it 
premiered in 
the UK, at the 
Royal Court Theatre in August 
2010. “Park” earned multiple 
awards, including a Pulitzer 
Prize in 2011 and a Tony in 2012 
for Best Play.

The play’s first act begins in 

1959, as a Black family decides 
to move into a dominantly white 
Chicago neighborhood. Bev 
and Russ are the owners of the 
home in the white middle-class 
area. They are informed that 
the family trying to move in is 
Black and advised to get out of 
the deal for fear that property 
values will dwindle if it’s car-
ried out.

Neighbors suggest this in an 

effort to uphold the “commu-
nity” of the neighborhood and 
preserve its value. The second 
act begins 50 years later and 
presents a reversal of circum-
stances, when a white couple 

wants to buy into a predomi-
nantly Black residential area, 
as those living in the neighbor-
hood are fighting against gen-
trification.

The play’s events are set in a 

bungalow house that appears 
well cared for in the first act, 
and in complete disarray in the 
second. The same actors reap-
pear in the second act, play-
ing drastically different roles, 
under entirely different circum-
stances.

“The house is actually a 

character in the play, the trophy 
around which the action and 
racial conflicts occur,” Director 
John Neville-Andrews wrote in 
an e-mail interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

“The only overlap with ‘A 

Raisin in the Sun’ is the char-
acter, Karl Lindner, who in that 
play tries to persuade the Black 
Younger family, unsuccessfully, 
not to move to Clybourne Park,” 
Neville-Andrews wrote. “Oth-
erwise ‘Clybourne Park’ stands 
entirely on it’s own merit and 
circumstances.”

While discussing the major 

themes this work aims to com-
municate, Neville-Andrews 
notes that the cast has had 
multiple discussions surround-
ing this topic. These forums 
involved an analysis of every 
possible point of view from 
which the cast could imagine 
seeing the play.

“We’ve all done a lot of 

research and had numerous 
discussions on racial tension, 
racism, gentrification, segrega-
tion and integration,” Neville-
Andrews wrote. “The way these 
aspects of life affected people in 

1959, 2009 and present day.”

“Park” communicates this 

racial divide satirically, bring-
ing a comedic touch to issues of 
race and gentrifying communi-
ties. 

“The underlying theme is, of 

course, how racial enmity fre-
quently bubbles under the sur-
face as the characters clumsily 
scramble to say the most politi-
cally correct thing,” Neville-
Andrews wrote. “Eventually 
this ‘code speak’ crumbles and 
true feelings are expressed.”

The play doesn’t force any 

conclusions or solutions to the 
societal problems the work 
communicates. The work allows 
for the audience to reflect on 
what they have seen onstage, 
and rely on their own observa-
tions as a “take away” from the 
events they witness.

The cast of “Park” was also 

able to gain useful information 
from one who knows the play 
rather well.

“We are fortunate that Bruce 

Norris, the playwright, came 
to visit us and he revealed to 
the cast and me various valu-
able insights to the characters 
and their motives in the play,” 
Neville-Andrews wrote. While 
discussing his experience 
directing the production, Nev-
ille-Andrews explained that the 
actors have aimed to make their 
roles truthful, engaging and 
dynamic for the audience, all of 
which has provided a rewarding 
experience.

“It’s been a delight to work 

on such a complex, scintillat-
ing and extremely funny play. 
Everyone should see it, for a 
variety of reasons.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

By ALLIE SCHOLTEN

For the Daily

In this digital-savvy age, 

many of us are married to our 
technology; one can’t walk 
through campus without 
seeing someone glued to their 
smartphone. Yet despite its 
old-fashioned tendency, my 
heart belongs to the United 
States Postal Service, a system 
traced back to the founding 
fathers. USPS vows “neither 
snow nor rain nor heat” will 
keep them from their job, six 
days a week.

Though a mailbox can 

be found in front of almost 
every residence, and one 
doesn’t have to look far to 
find a mail truck stationed 
on a street, letter writing has 
become an archaic form of 
communication in this digital 
age, so much so that the USPS 
faced an almost imminent 
collapse in 2011, threatening 
to shorten their work week 
and closing post offices to 
combat their deficit. Not 
even the eternal existence of 
junk mail could keep them in 
the ring, as this was quickly 
becoming electronic as well. 
“Snail mail” has become an 
endangered species since the 
uprising of email, awaiting 
its ultimate extinction at the 
hands of the digital age.

Many of my relationships 

revolve around a mailbox, 
rooted in the United States 
Postal Service and the archaic 
forms of correspondence. 
Letters and physical 
documentation are vital 
in stringing together my 
life events. The letters I’ve 
received remain squirreled 
away in old shoeboxes and 
desk drawers, a sort of 
personal time capsule lacking 
a “to-be-opened” date. While 
they are not poured over 
and read continuously, the 
mere preservation of these 
thoughts proves enough for 
my sentimental heart.

My string of 

correspondences can seem 
laughable when compared 
to the convenience of text 
messages and emails. Rightly 
so, for who would choose 
to wait two to seven days 
when the option of instant 
delivery is available? I can 
expect a text from my friends 
regularly – sentiments sent 
within the confines of 140 
characters or less. I’ll watch 
them flash to my screen, 
scrolling through them with 
the good intentions of storing 
them away in my phone to be 
revisited. Subsequently, I’ll 
end up deleting the record 
of correspondence during a 
debate over what I can part 
with to make room for the 
newest trending social media 
app. I crave the tangibility 
that comes with hard copy 
letters, creased within 
the envelopes. There is 
permanence in pen and ink, 
where digital communication 
can be lost at the first hint of 
water damage or inexplicable 
shutdown.

For now, postmen around 

the country will fill mailboxes 
with bundles of envelopes, 
emptying their blue canvas 
bags. These envelopes carry 
the documentations of 
holidays, birthdays and small 
sentiments. Personally, they 
have become lifelines of 
correspondence between those 
I care for and myself. While 
a text or email could have 
done justice to my thoughts, 
the idea that another person 
took the time to sit down and 
compose a letter has yet to 
cease being flattering.

We can hastily compose 

a text that will be delivered 
only seconds later, yet a letter 
takes time and consideration 
to compose. “Snail mail” hints 
at a sort of permanence; I have 
kept letters from a decade 
ago, yet I am slow to keep 
most emails for longer than 
a week – depositing them in 
their digital trashcan after I 
have gleaned all I could from 

The lost art of real, 
handwritten letters

POETRY

them. I remain nostalgic for the 
sending of handcrafted letters 
that surpass the emotional 
depths of a pre-printed 
Hallmark card.

The sending of letters has 

become a dying art; even my 
grandparents have put away 
their stamps and envelopes, 
turning to social media to learn 
of my goings-on. Despite its 
impending end, I have found 
immeasurable comfort within 
the lines of handwriting sent 
by my long-distance friends 
and family. They are filled with 
advice, sentiments and stories.

These words have been saved 

through the years. I find the 
letters carry both positive and 
negative memories interwoven 
between the lines, and I can 
trace my own history, as well 
as those of others, through 
their words. While the sending 
of letters may be a backwards 
step in our progressing society, 
technology has yet to match the 
warmth and sincerity I have 
found in mail.

Fenty x Puma, Rihanna’s 

collaboration with the 
activewear brand, debuted last 
Friday on the opening day of 
NYFW. The collection, almost 
exclusively black and white, 
displays extreme diversity 
and calculated, inspired risk. 
Most importantly, it shows a 
real knack for designing by the 
Barbadian superstar.

A diverse group of models 

rocked pieces, from thigh-
high white leather boots to a 
refreshingly loose-fitted sport 
short — highlighting Riri’s 
own fashion taste. Opting 
for grandiose, unapologetic 
comfort, lots of skin or a 
combination of both, the 
designer’s first runway show 
was cohesive and fresh, 
offering a high fashion line 
while remaining conscious of 
the brand’s activewear roots.

Tracksuits, sweatshirts, 

sweatpants and shorts 
comprise the collection’s most 
universally wearable pieces, 
but it’s the boundary-pushing 
looks that leave the biggest 

impression. The women’s 
mesh PUMA long-sleeve 
tops pay direct homage to 
Rihanna’s personal tastes and 
boldness. Men’s high-waisted 
sweatpants and one-piece 
sweat suits are hopefully 
predictors of the next wave of 
men’s fashion. A skin-tight, 
floor-length dress featuring 
criss-crossed snaking from 
cleavage to knee is a standout 
among the women’s looks.

Unzipped zippers are 

ubiquitous throughout the 
collection, emphasizing a 
laid-back feel — something 
consistently missing amid the 
often straight-faced, tight-
lipped persona of the fashion 
world. That’s not to say, of 
course, that Rihanna’s first 
runway of her own wasn’t a 
serious endeavor — the line 
showcased her personal style 
and attitude, while giving 
fans and customers both 
bold outfits for the brave and 
enough broad-reaching pieces 
to maintain Puma’s brand and 
the artist’s effortlessly cool 
aura.

The show’s third act twist 

broke out furs. Unisex gray 

hoodies and long black coats, 
modeled on men and women, 
add one final touch of fuck-
it chicness to the collection 
with their over-the-top, yet 
undeniably cozy look.

It-girl of the moment, Gigi 

Hadid, closed the show in 
white sneaker-heel hybrids, 
black mid-calves, a knee-
length and the aforementioned 
unzipped loose fur coat, 
summarizing the contrasting 
ideals of high-fashion and 
activewear. Hadid and many 
of her fellow models donned 
white, slicked back hair and 
black lipstick.

Yes, Rihanna’s fashion 

week debut is another notch 
on the bedpost of celebrity-
turned-designer shows. But 
the collection’s range from 
fashionable activewear to 
sport-inspired statement 
pieces and everything in 
between combined with 
discernible authenticity 
proves that Fenty x Puma’s 
first runway show certainly 
shouldn’t be the last.

STYLE RECAP

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Breaking the instrumenta-

tion with, “Her eyes and words 
are so icy / 
Oh but she 
burns,” Hozi-
er’s “Cherry 
Wine” is 
heavy. The 
Irishman’s 
delivery of 
haunting lyr-
ics is delicate 
yet power-
ful, as is the 
accompanying music video.

The video opens on a woman 

adjusting a dainty bracelet upon 
her wrist, drawing the view-
ers’ focus to faint bruises on 
her forearm. There’s a sudden 
switch to a scene of the woman 
intimately greeting a man — 
presumably her significant 
other. The contrast between the 
broken woman with the bruised 
limb and the same woman, 
now warm, greeting her man is 
stomach-churning. It becomes 
clear that the video is making 
a statement about a painfully 
reoccuring issue — domestic 
violence.

As the song progresses, the 

duality of the abused woman’s 
life is made ever clearer. 
The camera continually cuts 
between the woman’s private 
dealings with the severity of 
her situation and the seemingly 
happy, loving moments she has 
with her partner. At one point, 
a double-paned mirror shows 
the woman both bruised and 
fresh-faced, solidifying the 
reality that a battered individual 
is unable to be whole while 
trapped in a toxic relationship.

The colors and lighting 

of the video are muted, 
reflecting the piece’s somber 
message — no actions 
depicted are overtly violent or 
coercive. Prompting further 
thought, the video wraps 
with a black screen dawning 
“#faceuptodomesticviolence” 
and Hozier’s voice, seeming to 
speak to his own experience, 
ringing “Open hand or closed 
fist would be fine / Blood is rare 
and sweet as cherry wine.”

T

his past weekend, I 
went with my parents 
and siblings to visit 

extended family in Palm Springs, 
California. 
As we sat, 
mimosa 
in 
hand, 

around the 
pool, them 
blonde 
and shim-
mering, 
I 

beige 
as 

February 
snow, talk 
turned, as 
it 
invari-

ably does, to politics. Though I 
protested, a discussion between 
California libertarians and Mich-
igan liberals began, running the 
gamut of ridiculous claims and 
irreconcilable biases. I took extra 
gulps of my mimosa, willing 
myself not to talk as wild asser-
tions flew around me.

“Kasich seems sturdy. He’s 

been a very successful governor.”

If 
you 
consider 
defunding 

nearly all women’s health options 
successful, sure. 

“Jeb just needs to grow some 

balls to compete with Trump.”

Because testicles are really the 

paragon of anatomical strength …

“The first woman president — 

how sure are we that Hillary is 
actually a woman?”

Jesus Christ.
“Women like Bernie more than 

Hillary. They can’t trust her.”

This word “trust,” how can 

you not admit it’s gendered and 
placing Hillary in an impossible 
bind between showing fortitude 
and showing care? And where are 
your statistics outside of Twitter 
and Fox News, please?

And will someone just buy 

Bernie a goddamn comb already.

As I was sitting by the pool, 

unsuccessfully ignoring the sexist 
remarks, I read Vanity Fair’s 
February cover story on Fox News 
pundit Megyn Kelly.

As a liberal, I find Kelly to be 

a complicated enigma — on one 
hand, she seems unabashedly 
selfish 
and 
opportunistic, 

defending her individual right to 
maternity leave one moment and 
making searing statements against 
women’s health organizations the 
next. She is of the camp of people — 
specifically, of women — who scoff 
at feminism, asserting that their 
own chutzpah and perseverance 
got them to where they are, and 
that other women should stop 
complaining and just do the same.

On the other hand, in an August 

Republican 
debate 
moderated 

by Kelly, her first question was 
directed 
at 
Donald 
Trump, 

directly calling him out for his 
past misogynistic statements, and 
questioning his ability to lead a 
country comprised of 51 percent 
women. (That he turned around 
and asserted that she was rude 

because she “had blood coming 
out of her wherever” only seemed 
to reinforce the need for her 
initial question.)

Emotionally, I don’t really 

know what to do with Kelly, as 
I’m morally against most of the 
opinions she holds most dear. 
But in terms of the public eye, 
and the political cycle, I know 
she’s important. In an election 
year in which the media matters 
more than anything else, there 
is unspeakable value in a female 
political pundit getting so much 
attention.

There is so much to be 

said about female politician’s 
representations 
in 
the 

media. But the subtle digs 
and 
subconscious 
judgments 

on Hillary, on pundits like 
Megyn, are nothing new. As so 
many have written before me, 
female politicians, especially 
ones with illustrious histories 
like Clinton, are constantly 
battling 
expectations 
from 

all sides: “Show strength, but 
vulnerability. Be direct, but 
not a bitch. Be honest, but 
still prophetic. Never fuck up. 
Always say the right thing. 
Above all, be human.”

Just like everyone, Hillary 

is imperfect. But when you 
compare 
media 
criticisms 

of her with those made of 
other candidates, the biases 
are glaring. She is judged for 
her clothing, she is parodied 
as 
robotic 
by 
even 
liberal 

organizations 
like 
Saturday 

Night Live. She is criticized for 
not being female enough (the 
pantsuits), while her 50 years 
of accomplishments are picked 
apart for every possible error. 

This is all stuff we’ve heard 

before. Being a woman in any 
public space, particularly one 
dominated 
by 
men, 
means 

that you are often held to a 
much higher standard than 
the men around you — Hillary 
has to do twice as much to be 
revered half as much as the men 
around her. What I find more 
enlightening 
is 
discovering 

biases in the reverse; picking 
apart male candidates’ histories 
and calculating how a woman 
in their position may have been 
treated.

Many people don’t know that 

the mother of Bernie Sanders’ 
only biological son, Levi, was 
Bernie’s girlfriend at the time, 
Susan 
Mott. 
They 
weren’t 

married then, and they never got 
married. In years after Levi’s 
birth, Bernie ran for Vermont 
gubernatorial 
and 
senatorial 

campaigns, never winning but 
upending the political landscape 
of Vermont. Finally, in 1980, he 
became mayor of Burlington, 
beginning in earnest his public 
political career.

I didn’t know any of this 

before embarking on a lengthy 

Sanders 
research 
quest, 

and I find the lack of public 
knowledge about it notable. 
Imagine a female politician in 
his shoes; giving birth to a son 
“out of wedlock,” continuing to 
try to fight for political office. 
Would she have succeeded? 
Would she have to fight not 
only social and institutional 
battles (as an unwed mother) 
but media-driven ones as well? 
My belief is that she would have 
been ravaged by the media, her 
morals and judgment called 
into question. My belief is that 
she wouldn’t be running for 
president today.

From the other side, we 

have a man like Ted Cruz. 
Known 
to 
be 
onerous 
by 

most who have met him — 
especially by his particularly 
vocal 
college 
roommate 
— 

Cruz is not considered to be 
warm or genuine. In fact, he is 
considered to be pretty slimy, 
by Republicans and Democrats 
alike. His (heinous) policies 
aside, 
interpersonally 
Cruz 

doesn’t bring much to the table. 
But voters are coming for him 
in droves. Would a woman with 
Cruz’s demeanor — dishonest, 
malicious, 
sometimes 
even 

vulgar — be winning like him? 
Would she even receive enough 
support to start a campaign to 
begin with? My belief is that 
she wouldn’t, because first and 
foremost women are supposed 
to be likeable.

So this is why I struggle 

every time I hear someone 
say they don’t like Hillary 
because they can’t trust her, 
or because they don’t find her 
likeable, or because they don’t 
like her “vibes.” Not only do 
we need to be conscious of 
the institutional sexism that 
is constantly working against 
female candidates; we need to 
think about what isn’t being said 
about the male ones.

This is not a tacit endorsement 

of 
Clinton, 
nor 
a 
tirade 

against the male candidates. 
I understand the legitimate 
reasons for and against each of 
them. But I think many people, 
even liberal, intellectual voters, 
forget to look in between the 
lines when it comes to the 
public gendering of an election 
season. Male candidates are 
where they are because of their 
privileges, their successes, their 
intelligence 
and 
persistence 

and their adversities. Female 
candidates are up against the 
same — their adversities are just 
much greater, and much more 
insidious.

The 
American 
Medical 

Association confirms it: given 
a generally healthy lifestyle, 
moderate coffee intake likely 
has no negative effect on health. 
Which is really a good thing, 
if you think about it, because 
according 
to 
the 
National 

Coffee Association 54 percent 
of 
Americans 
over 
age 
18 

consume an average of 3.1 cups 
of it daily. I’m certainly a culprit 
in this, as consuming the elixir 
of life (read: coffee) is part of 
my daily routine — without it 
the rest of my day always feels 
vaguely dulled, as if it were 
being regarded from a moderate 
distance. (I even once kept track 
of how many cups of elixir I 
drank in year 2014. Final tally: 
1,183 — a copious amount of 
consumption, I realize, but in my 
defense, it started as an innocent 
question posed between myself 
and a friend before quickly 
falling into a downward spiral 
of competition fueled by a 
playfully 
adversarial 
spirit 

and our mutual dependence 
on the world’s most prevalent 
and 
commercially 
available 

psychoactive stimulant. So it’s 
only half my fault.) Given that, 
you can imagine my delight 
upon meeting someone whose 
love affair with elixir was even 
more passionate than my own — 
Ben Foster, an LSA senior.

“My aunt started this coffee 

catering 
business 
when 
I 

was about 13,” Foster told me 
over a steaming beverage last 
Thursday. “So as soon as we 
(Foster and his similarly aged 
relatives) were old enough — 
probably before we were old 
enough — we would all be piling 
in the car … working for this 
company.”

While many people indulge in 

recurring recreational activities 
of a relatively niche nature, 
Foster has one that is rarer than 
most. As a coffee roaster, he is a 
connoisseur of sorts who took 
his love a step further into the 
act of creation. 

Foster and I met at an 

establishment 
called 
Crazy 

Wisdom Bookstore and Tea 
Room, which is a charming little 
store about a 15-minute walk 
northwest of Central Campus. 
When you enter the bookstore, 
the first thing you notice is the 
potent layer of incense in the air. 
The second thing is probably the 
sort of new age-y music playing 
quietly 
in 
the 
background, 

the kind that has gentle synth 
strings playing blurry chords 
at long duration and optionally 
includes some sort of Asian 
instrument 
in 
a 
soloistic 

capacity, with the intent of 
making 
a 
more 
meditative 

atmosphere but the effect of 
being only a rather surface level 
imitation (this sort of music 
may also be vaguely described 
as “zen”). If you look around 
at the books stocked, you’ll see 
various volumes of literature 
on numerous schools of Eastern 
philosophy, some translations 
of original texts and others 
more obviously composed with 
Western 
disposable-income-

types in mind. Upstairs is a 
small cafe area, which is filled 
with amicable chatter and the 
delicious aroma of assorted 
teas, as well as that of nectar of 
the gods from Ann Arbor’s own 
Mighty Good Coffee.

“This is my third interview at 

Crazy Wisdom, actually, but two 
of them were job interviews,” 
Foster said, laughing. “I love 
this place.”

Foster 
didn’t 
become 

extremely interested in coffee 
until he started studying at 
the University of Michigan, 
where he is pursuing a degree 
in computer science and is in 
the process of adding a minor in 
Russian.

“I started going to Mighty 

Good down the street and 
starting making it a regular 
thing with my friend — we’d go 
every single Friday because our 
classes worked out that way. 
We’d make the trek, and it was 
a good way to unwind after the 
week,” Foster said of the real 
beginning of his affair with 
elixir.

“Their (Mighty Good’s) thing 

is they have a lot of single-origin 
coffees, which is just coffee 
that’s sourced from usually one 
estate in a certain region, so you 
can just sort of fall back and call 
them by their country of origin,” 
Foster said. “I remember one 
time I had this one coffee; it was 
a Guatemalan Huehuetenango 
… I looked at the tasting notes, 
and I actually tasted hints of 
peanut butter in that coffee. 
I thought tasting notes were 
ridiculous before that, I just sort 
of brushed them off, and never 
thought of coffee as something 
that could be really complex.”

Not long after Foster made 

a habit of tasting all of Mighty 
Good’s 
coffee 
selection, 

exploring the various single 
origin brews and gradually 
trying his hand at more nuanced 

home brewing methods.

“I 
bought 
an 
AeroPress, 

which is basically a tube with 
a plunger — it’s like a French 
press, but with a paper filter,” 
Foster said. “I bought a hand 
crank grinder, so I’d grind all 
my beans … so I just started 
acquiring 
all 
this 
brewing 

equipment.”

Foster now buys raw green 

coffee and roasts his own beans. 
Over the last few years, he’s 
experimented 
with 
various 

creative roasting methods, with 
varying success.

“I started doing it with an 

aluminum 
popcorn 
popping 

stove top thing, like where you 
crank the thing — it makes the 
most disgusting noises ever, just 
screeching noises — so that was 
short-lived because it was really 
obnoxious,” Foster said. “Then 
I started putting a colander full 
of coffee beans into the oven 
at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and then shaking them every 
minute.”

Partly 
due 
to 
the 

inconsistencies of the resulting 
roast 
from 
these 
methods, 

and partly due to the slow 
accumulation of mild burns, 
Foster now uses an air popcorn 
popper (plus a long cardboard 
tube) for his elixir production, 
which he says allows a more 
consistent roast because of the 
agitation and airflow resulting 
in a constant temperature.

“What I think is so cool about 

it is that anyone can go out and 
get an air roaster and order 
coffee online — green coffee 
is so cheap, it’s great,” Foster 
said as he pulled out a bag of 
green coffee to show me. “I 
guess I probably look a bit like 
a drug lord with this,” he said, 
laughing (though referring to 
him in that manner wouldn’t 
actually 
be 
excessively 

inaccurate. After all, caffeine 
is the most widely used drug in 
the world).

“My big thing is fresh coffee. 

Pre-ground coffee is always 
stale. Once you crush the bean 
down you’ve just exposed all 
those little pieces of coffee 
to air, so it just oxygenates,” 
Foster said. “The thing that I do 
differently, I think … is fresh, 
consistent grind, and a better 
ratio of water to coffee.”

When asked about his goals 

for and general ideas about 
coffee, Foster had a simple 
explanation for his love, one 
that is certainly relatable to 
most of our society.

“My perfect state of mind 

is listening to some music, not 
having anything to do, and 
sipping a cup of coffee,” Foster 
said.

I can dig that.
