Students recount 
experiences with 

sexual assault at 29th 
annual SAPAC event

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

At 
the 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center’s 29th annual Speak Out, 
more than 150 attendees shared 
and listened to each other’s 
personal 
accounts 
of 
sexual 

assault and harassment.

The public forum presented an 

opportunity for self-identifying 
survivors of sexual assault to 
speak in a confidential setting. 
Common themes, such as others 
doubting their accounts and the 
importance of advocacy and 
solidarity emerged in many of the 
stories.

LSA senior Alex Barkin, a 

co-coordinator with SAPAC, said 
Speak Out provides a safe space 
for survivors.

“A lot of people up there 

speaking 
have 
never 
spoken 

before, and it’s a way for people 
to start thinking of ways they can 

heal,” Barkin said.

The 
event’s 
organizers 

repeatedly 
emphasized 
both 

confidentiality 
and 
safety 

throughout the session. About 
20 SAPAC volunteers staffed 
the event and were present 
throughout the session in case 
any of the survivors’ accounts 
proved triggering for listeners. 
Professional 
advocates 
also 

manned a separate crisis room to 
serve as on-call support.

“The sharing that takes place is 

emotional and powerful, and we 
need to make sure that survivors 
are in a safe space,” she said.

Survivors 
echoed 
similar 

sentiments.

“We’ve all been through so 

much of the same,” one survivor 
said. “This bond we have, even 
if it’s the worst bond ever, is still 
amazing.”

LSA senior Kara Kundert, a 

SAPAC peer facilitator, noted 
that Speak Out often empowers 
survivors 
to 
begin 
working 

toward institutional change. 

“The advocacy work being 

done, 
especially 
by 
student 

survivors, comes out of spaces 
like this,” she said. “Having

Takacs Quartet 

performs composer’s 
‘Strong Language’

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

The image of the starv-

ing artist is one of the most 
deeply ingrained etchings in 
the collective consciousness 
of the West-
ern 
world, 

and certainly 
with 
good 

reason. 
For 

generations, 
many creative 
laborers have 
struggled 
to sustain a 
comfortable 
income 
for 

themselves, 
often 
wres-

tling with a 
public 
that 

doesn’t place a high monetary 
value on creative work. In 
many cases, artists will take 
a second job with a more sus-
tainable cash flow — in the 
most favorable instances, a job 
related to their art.

For the creative figure of the 

composer, this second job will 
often involve teaching music, 
both privately or at a college or 
university. But for those cou-
rageous and talented few who 

work to make a living by com-
posing alone, income generally 
comes in the form of commis-
sions, requests for a new work 
for a specific ensemble or 
occasion. In Rackham Audito-
rium on Wednesday, the Takács 
String Quartet will be perform-
ing one such commissioned 
piece, Timo Andres’s Strong 
Language, 
written 
for 
the 

ensemble and commissioned by 
Carnegie Hall and Shriver Hall.

Timo Andres is a young and 

talented composer and pianist 
based out of Brooklyn. Born 
in 1985, he first came under 
the public gaze in 2010 with 
the release of his piano music 
album Shy and Mighty, which 
The New Yorker’s Alex Ross 
wrote “achieves an unhurried 
grandeur that has rarely been 
felt in American music since 
John Adams came on the scene” 
— but Andres’s musical life 
began far earlier.

“I grew up as a pretty serious 

classical pianist. I started when 
I was about seven, and became 
pretty serious pretty quickly. It 
was something that I initially 
just took to very naturally, and 
then pretty soon just decid-
ed that it was going to be my 
career,” Andres said in a phone 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

“And I started writing things 

down right around the same 
time. It was just sort of some-
thing that I didn’t even really

The Native American Student 

Association capped off Native 
American Heritage Month on 

Monday night with a concert 
featured noted performers Frank 
Waln and Samsoche Sampson.

The performance, which drew 

more than 80 people, featured 
a blend of Native American 
dancing 
and 
traditional 

instrument 
playing 
overlaid 

on more modern, hip-hop style 
music.

Waln, 
a 
Sicangu

from South Dakota, has been 
recognized for his work raising 
awareness for Native American 

culture, 
and 
has 
received 

numerous

Sampson is an artist who 

works to fuse modern art with 
traditional 
Native 
American 

elements, 
and 
his 
work 

involves a variety of mediums 
including dance, music, acting,

Neurology Prof. Lewis Morgenstern, a health disparities researcher, speaks about a program to reduce income 
inequality at the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs meeting in the Regents Room on Monday

CSG president also 
calls for expedited 
release of course 
evaluation data

By GEN HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
potential 
University 

program to address income 
inequality led discussion at 
Monday’s 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs 
meeting 
— 
where 

Neurology 
Prof. 
Lewis 

Morgenstern, whose research 
focuses on health disparities, 
unveiled a “social experiment” 
to address the issue.

The meeting also featured 

comments from CSG President 
Cooper 
Charlton, 
an 
LSA 

senior, 
who 
again 
asked 

SACUA to move up the timeline 
for releasing student course 
evaluatation data.

Morgenstern 
said 
the 

income gap in the United 
States, which hesaid is higher 
now than it’s ever been with 
the exception of just before the 
Great Depression, is one of the 
main factors driving health 
care inequality. He added that 
the responsibility to address 
the growing disparity must fall 
to the private sector.

Under Morgenstern’s plan, 

those working at the top end of 
the University’s pay scale would 
have the opportunity to donate 
a percentage of their salary to 
those working at the low end 
of the University’s pay scale. 
The idea is that money that 
might otherwise be locked into 
retirement funds could now be 

transferred to those who would 
spend it immediately.

Morgenstern 
was 
quick 

to clarify that the idea is not 
driven by a particular problem 
at the University. Instead, 
he hopes the University can 
pioneer the program with the 
eventual goal of its adoption by 
large, for-profit corporations.

“This is not in any way saying 

that there’s anything wrong 
with 
what 
happens 
here,” 

Morgenstern said. “This is just 
a social experiment that could 
go on anywhere and might as 
well start at home. Being an 
employee at the University 
of Michigan is a great thing 
and in no way is this targeting 
Michigan because there’s a 
problem.”

DNA samples

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Before he was University 

president, Mark Schlissel was 
the dean of biological sciences 
at the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
During 
his 
tenure 

there, 
he 
helped 
implement 

a 
controversial 
orientation 

program in which all freshmen 
were asked to submit a DNA 
sample for analysis, which were 
intended to then inform an 
orientation week discussion on 
genetics.

Schlissel 
discussed 
that 

project — and the backlash to it 
— during a panel held Monday 
as part of the University of 
Michigan Department of Human 
Genetics Seminar Series.

The 
orientation 
program, 

called “Bring Your Genes to Cal,” 
initially intended to analyze 
student saliva samples for three 
non-disease 
associated 
genes 

related to the ability to metabolize 
alcohol, lactose and folic acid. 
In return for submitting their 
samples, students were told they 
would have access to their own 
results and the opportunity to

Middle East in the South Thayer Building on Monday.
Event explores effects of ISIS on 
historical artifacts in Middle East

Violence promoted by 
terrorist group takes 
toll on preservation 

of the past

By EMILY DAVIES

For the Daily

As nations worldwide grapple 

with the rise of the terrorist 
group ISIS, the Near Eastern 
Studies Department held an 
event Monday to discuss the 
physical and historical impacts 
of the group’s violence on the 
modern Middle East, and its 
direct link to the United States 
and European nations.

Three faculty members and 

about 40 attendees joined Geoff 
Emberling, assistant research 
scientist at the Kelsey Museum 
of Archaeology, to discuss the 
destruction of antiquities and 
the state of ruin in the Middle 
East.

Images of destroyed monu-

ments and historical sites cycled 

behind the speakers as they talked 
about how the city of Apamea in 
western Syria was looted block by 
block, and barrel bombs pressed 
against artwork in the palace of 
Ashurnasirpal II.

Panelists provided attendees 

with their perspectives on ISIS’ 
path of destruction and one 
common theme emerged: help-
lessness.

“This situation is extremely 

dire, and it’s not going to get 
better soon … I have a tremen-
dous sense of impotence. There 
is very little we can do about 
it, and that is the depressing 
part,” said Piotr Michalowski, 
a professor of ancient Near 
Eastern languages and civili-
zation.

Emberling began his lecture by 

providing a brief history of Iraqi 
and Syrian destruction. The panel 
followed a previous lecture he 
gave in early November to a Muse-
um Studies program on a similar 
topic. Emberling said he invited 
to continue the conversation with 
a second event due to the amount 
of interest surrounding this topic.

Emberling summarized related 

historical events, like Saddam 
Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and 
ISIS’ recently acquired caliphate 
label, but his focus moved toward 
understanding how these his-
torical events and the intentional 
destruction of historical artifacts 
are linked to the United States and 
European nations.

Strategically, 
through 
the 

destruction 
of 
Roman 
arti-

facts, ISIS gains attention from 
the West and from potential 
recruits. 
Roman 
monuments 

in the Middle East are more 
closely related to European and 
U.S. culture than any heritage in 
the Near East. Because of this, 
U.S. media reacts strongly when 
such artifacts are targeted.

Panelists said this public-

ity in Western countries is 
exactly what ISIS is seeking. 
This national attention attracts 
young radicals searching for 
a 
voice. 
Economically, 
the 

destruction helps ISIS due to its 
sale of some antiquities. By bull-
dozing large arches or monu-
ments, ISIS makes room to dig 

up the portable, and therefore 
marketable, items. By publicly 
advertising the growing scar-
city of Middle Eastern artifacts, 
ISIS increases the value of these 
smaller objects.

As scholars, Emberling and the 

other panelists said they often feel 
defeated by ISIS’ durability. Given 
the massive humanitarian crisis 
that ISIS has caused, critics may 
question the attention to artifact 
destruction.

As 
Emberling 
articulated, 

understanding 
the 
strategy 

behind 
ISIS’ 
destruction 
of 

national history calls attention 
to the broader story explaining 
the rise of ISIS.

“What are the larger condi-

tions that make it possible for a 
larger movement like this to take 
root?” Emberling asked. “It has 
a large part to do with Ameri-
can policy … (The destruction 
of antiquities) can call atten-
tion to this Middle Eastern issue 
beyond the political debates 
we’ve been hearing that demon-
ize refugees who are just trying 
to survive.”

member for Relay for Life at

Which of the student 
organizations you’re 

involved in has the largest 

impact on campus?

They all have a large impact 
on campus, especially 
because they are all service 
related, for such amazing 
causes. The one that has 
had the strongest impact on 
campus for me is the MRelay. 
That may just be because of 

how I feel towards Relay for 
Life. But my involvement 
since I’ve started school here 
has been just an amazing 
transforming experience 
for me.

What is MRelay and what 

makes it special?

It’s just an environment to be 
surrounded by people who 
have the same goal as you — 
to get rid of cancer. The event 
is only 24 hours on Palmer 
Field, but throughout the 
year teams fundraise for the 
American Cancer Society. 
(MRelay) has found the 
most passionate, dedicated 
people and made them 
into a planning committee. 
Everyone is so different 
from their backgrounds, to 

why they Relay, to what they 
study, to what they do on 
their Friday nights, it’s crazy 
how that one cause just 
brings them all together.

What is the service 
atmosphere like on 

campus?

A lot of the student 
organizations, regardless of 
whether they are service-
based or not, have some 
sort of service component, 
so I think there are a lot of 
opportunities for service 
on campus, and I think for 
the most part we have the 
population of people that 
have the desire to serve.

directly, recipients would be 
free to spend the money as they 
choose.

“To a large extent I think 

some of the problems with 
charities are that they’re very 
paternalistic,” 
Morgenstern 

said. “The problem with the 
income gap is that people don’t 
tell me how to spend my money 
and I would rather not tell the 
recipient how to spend this 
money. I would like them to be 
able to use the money for what 
they feel is most important.”

Morgenstern acknowledged 

potential kinks in the plan: It 
does not promise a constant 
year-to-year flow of additional 
income for all recipients, it has 
the potential to reflect poorly 
on the University and faculty 
and staff might be reluctant to 
participate in the program. In 
addition, decisions regarding 
what the pay scale cutoff would 
be for donors and recipients 
would still need to be made.

Ultimately, Morgenstern said 

the plan is not a form of charity, 
but a way to acknowledge the 
disparities that persist in society 
today.

“In my particular specialty 

in medicine, I am in the low 
end of the pay scale but still 
above the cut point. I don’t 
believe that I have the right to 
make that amount of money 
so much more than the person 
that cleans the toilet in my area 
for 50 years. I have a great job. I 
get to sit here with all of you and 

talk about this very interesting, 
intellectual thing. Yeah, I work 
very hard, I went to school. But I 
don’t get 50 years of rewards for 
that. To me the selling point has 
to be what are we really trying 
to do? This is different from 
charitable giving, you’re paying 
to play. You’re paying to have the 
job that you have.”

SACUA members also met 

with 
representatives 
from 

Central Student Government, 
Rackham Student Government 
and the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization 
at 
Monday’s 

meeting.

Charlton, the CSG president, 

expressed 
frustration 
with 

the course evaluation release 
timeline and said he hoped 
the meeting would be an 
opportunity 
for 
student 

government 
and 
faculty 

government to move forward 
with existing plans to make 
those evaluations available to 
students.

“I would love to find a 

way that we can collaborate, 
but I think it’s time for us to 
really get this conversation 
on the table so we can all 
move forward and have a 
positive working relationship,” 
Charlton said. 

As it stands, two committees 

are being formed to address the 
issue of course evaluation data 
release. One committee will 
evaluate the current course 
evaluation instrument and the 
other committee will evaluate 
best practices for releasing 
the data. SACUA has agreed to 
release course evaluation data 
to academic advisers. A pilot 

will be released to advisers 
in early December, and full 
access to advisers should be 
available by early January of 
next year.

There was also debate about 

which 
student-governing 

bodies 
have 
the 
authority 

to 
appoint 
representatives 

to 
University 
committees. 

Though 
the 
authority 
has 

generally fallen to CSG, an 
e-mail sent out earlier this 
fall 
has 
caused 
confusion 

around 
the 
issue. 
The 

e-mail 
mistakenly 
invited 

RSG to appoint committee 
representatives as well.

Charlton maintained that 

CSG should be the only group 
invited to appoint committee 
representatives, given it is the 
only group that represents 
the entirety of the student 
population.

“Central 
Student 

Government reserves the right 
to hold every appointment 
that goes in any of these 
committees, unfortunately a 
compromise that Chuky (the 
RSG president) did not want 
to take early on is making me 
arrive at a more stern and 
unfortunately 
professional 

tonality. I want to make sure 
that we move forward together, 
but think that we need to 
silence this conversation about 
which students are talking 
on behalf of which students, 
because CSG, in order to 
reserve the solidarity of all 
students, needs to be the only 
person at this table.”

In 
response, 
RSG 

President 
Chuky 
Mbagwu, 

an 
aerospace 
engineering 

doctoral 
candidate, 
said 

CSG 
appointments 
do 
not 

include enough graduate and 
professional students.

“We 
as 
RSG 
contend 

and maintain that for years 
CSG has not actually been a 
representative for the graduate 
student 
and 
professional 

student voice, only in name,” 
Mbagwu 
said. 
“There 
are 

so many other professional 
student governments that are 
saying the same thing. The 
appointments that they made 
before RSG started doing it did 
not have any representation 
from Rackham, and maybe 
just a few from professional 
schools.”

SACUA Chair Silke-Maria 

Weineck, 
a 
professor 
of 

comparative literature, said 
the University should stick 
with its current procedure 
for now, allowing CSG to 
appoint students to University 
committees. 
However, 

she added that the issue is 
something that has to be 
worked out among student 
government groups, not by 
SACUA.

“I 
want 
to 
respect 

the 
autonomy 
of 
student 

organizations and I do not 
think it should be SACUA’s job 
to arbitrate disputes you have 
within student government; 
I think that’s not our role,” 
Weineck said. “Right now our 
charter says Central Student 
Government, we’re not going 
to change the charter in the 
middle of the semester, it’s bad 
policy.” 

engage in broader discussion 
about genetics.

“We became enamored with 

this idea because it seemed like 
an early example of engaged 
learning,” Schlissel said on 
Monday. “Students could send 
in their own DNA sample and 
then be able to interact with the 
results of that sample directly.”

However, 
the 
California 

Department of Public Health 
said because the actual genetic 
testing would be conducted 
in a university, not a clinical 
lab, the tests would need to 

be 
ordered 
by 
physicians. 

Critics also pointed to privacy 
concerns and argued students 
were not equipped with the 
proper knowledge to interpret 
the information they’d receive 
about their DNA.

Schlissel 
said 
“Bring 

Your 
Genes 
to 
Cal” 
was 

designed 
as 
an 
alternative 

to reading an assigned book 
prior to orientation, with the 
intention of allowing students 
to more actively engage in 
learning about personalized 
medicine. 
By 
testing 
non-

disease associated genes that 
commonly vary among the 
population, the program was 
not designed to provide medical 

information, but to involve 
students in the life sciences 
and demonstrate how genetic 
testing in the modern age could 
enhance medical treatment. 
In the end, the University 
organized campus discussions 
and educational sessions about 
genetic testing instead.

“Things got pretty heated,” 

Schlissel said. “Some criticisms 
involved 
groups 
expressing 

their opinions in a pretty 
incendiary way.”

After the lecture, a panel 

consisting 
of 
Schilssel, 

Internal Medicine Prof. David 
Ginsburg and Scott Roberts, 
an associate professor of health 
behavior and health education, 

facilitated a discussion with 
audience members.

“There 
is 
something 
to 

the idea that students would 
be more engaged,” Roberts 
said. “It is an interesting and 
personal teaching topic.”

Human Genetics Prof. Sally 

Camper said the purpose of the 
seminar was to bring awareness 
to genetic testing and the debate 
surrounding it.

“Genetic testing is being 

marketed directly to consumers 
and being used ‘recreationally’ 
through searches for ancestral 
connections etc.” Camper said 
in an e-mail interview. “This is 
relatively new and not without 
controversy.”

solving tool based on respectful 
conversation — preceded the 
performance. In the circle, Waln 
talked 
about 
his 
experiences 

with education and the issues 
the Native American community 
faces.

During 
the 
circle 
session, 

he reflected on his experience 
transitioning from high school 
on a poor reservation to college. 
He said he often felt secluded 
in an education system built to 
primarily boost white males.

“These 
systems 
of 
higher 

education are not built for us,” 
Waln said. “They are built for 
white men to succeed. It is hard 
being a person of color in these 
types of systems. I learned that 
going to school in these systems, 
and I often felt very isolated and 
alone.”

Waln added that the most 

important thing for people to learn 
about Native Americans is that 
the population was continuously 
subject 
to 
institutionalized 

subjugation.

“Genocide happened in this 

country, and we survived it,” he 
said. “We are talking about the 
Jewish Holocaust in our high 
schools, but they don’t tell you that 
holocaust and genocide happened 
here, on the land that class is being 
held on.”

The concert featured a set 

of songs and dances in Waln’s 
style, which incorporates native 
elements with hip hop. Waln 
performed 
lyrically 
while 

Sampson 
accompanied 
with 

traditional 
instruments 
and 

dance.

During 
the 
performance, 

Sampson, 
who 
had 
not 

participated in the talking circle, 
shared his story. Sampson grew 
up in Southern California and said 
he stayed connected to culture 
through his mother’s influence 
and the Palo community present 
there.

“She 
did 
what 
she 
could 

to provide for us and keep us 
connected 
to 
our 
culture,” 

Sampson said. “We got connected 
to the Palo culture, and that is how 
we maintained our connection.”

Between songs, Waln spoke 

about the story behind each song 
he performed. At one point, he 
talked about his forthcoming 
album.

“I consider what I do to be 

storytelling,” Waln said. “This 
album is telling my story of how 
I’m trying to actively heal from 
all of these wounds that I have 
because of colonization.”

Alexis 
Syrette, 
a 
Central 

Michigan University freshman, 
said Waln will continue to have 
success and inspire people if he 
continues performing.

“I think Frank is a really 

inspirational person, and he is 
going to continue to inspire young 
indigenous people all across the 
country,” she said. “As long as he 
keeps doing what he is doing, he is 
going to succeed.”

Public Policy senior Isa Gaillard, 

a co-chair of NASA, said this event 
is a start to increasing the visibility 
of Native Americans on campus.

“This is a start so we can have 

more opportunities for events like 
this and to raise awareness about 
the native community,” he said. 
“Michigan has one of the highest 
indigenous populations in this 
country, so as a University that 
really prides itself on being on the 
forefront of social justice issues 
and making sure that it promotes 
diversity, I think this is a really 
great chance to highlight one 
of the areas where this is really 
lacking.”

Syrian refugees 
expected to arrive 
in Ann Arbor

Even though Gov. Rick Snyder 

(R) has put a temporary restraint 
on incoming refugees from Syria, 
more are expected to relocate to 
Ann Arbor.

Currently there are about 16 

refugees living in Ann Arbor.

The sole refugee resettlement 

agency in Washtenaw County, 
Jewish Family Services, says 
Syrian families are currently 
waiting to be cleared before they 
can come to Ann Arbor. The 
application process in full takes at 
least 18 months.

Since 2012, around 240 refugees 

have resettled in Washtenaw 
County.

Report: Detroit to 
bounce back after 
bankruptcy

In its biannual report to Gov. 

Rick Snyder (R) on Nov. 30, 
the Detroit Financial Review 
Commission said the city is 
effectively moving forward in its 
restructuring and reinvestment 
plan put in place after it exited 
bankruptcy last year.

The commission of nine was 

created last year to monitor the 
city’s progress and ensure Detroit 
continues to meet its “Grand 
Bargain” requirements. Members 
are appointed by the governor, 
mayor and city council members.

For its review, the commission 

approved 237 contracts of city 
employees and the agreement 
between 
the 
transit 
union 

and 
Detroit’s 
transportation 

department.

According to the report, Detroit 

anticipates a $35 million budget 
surplus this year.

New study indicates 
ADHD medication 
leads to bullying

A study by the University 

suggests 
children 
who 
take 

medications which treat attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder have 
double the chance of experiencing 
physical 
and/or 
emotional 

bullying than children who do not.

Middle school and high school 

students who sell or share their 
ADHD medications were 4.5 
times more likely to be bullied.

The four-year study was funded 

by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse and took data from about 
5,000 middle and high school 
students.

It is the first study of its kind to 

research the link between ADHD 
medications and bullying. Other 
studies have shown a link between 
children having ADHD and an 
increase in bullying.

ADHD has been increasing in 

recent years. There has been a 42 
percent increase in diagnoses for 
ADHD between 2003 and 2011, in 
the United States.

Daily antibiotics 
can prevent spread 
of tuberculosis

Daily doses of antibiotics can 

better prevent the creation of 
drug resistant strains than the 
current recommendation of one 
to two doses a week, according to 
a University study.

The study was conducted using 

a computer model of the virus 
because animal experiments are 
expensive and take a long time 
to complete, and often come 
with ethical concerns. Computer 
models can be more accurate 
than animal tests because they 
can detect issues with antibiotic 
regiments sooner.

Turberculosis is difficult to 

treat and about 10 million people 
contract it each year. Antibiotic-
resistant strains of tuberculosis 
are on the rise as well.

Because doctors are unable to 

tell whether someone has been 
completely rid of the virus or if 
it has become dormant in the 
patient’s body, strains of the virus 
can face exposure to antibiotics 
for years.

themselves.” 

SAPAC and the University have 

worked together in recent years 
to bring additional awareness to 
sexual assault on campus, creating 
programs like Relationship Remix, 
a mandatory seminar for first-year 
students. However, attitudes toward 
the administration’s treatment of 
students’ experiences on campus 
varied. Some speakers found that 
coming to college provided new 
insight regarding the definition of 
assault.

“It took this campus to teach 

me the appropriate terms and to 
understand what happened to me,” a 
survivor said.

Kundert pushed for more services 

for student survivors, especially 
in light of the ongoing federal 

investigation into the University’s 
handling of sexual misconduct.

“This is important especially 

on a college campus where it’s so 
prevalent,” 
Kundert 
said. 
“And 

SAPAC has five staff members … for 
40,000 people.”

Barkin 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of Speak Out and 
survivor care on a large campus.

In 
2015, 
the 
University 

participated in two surveys designed 
to gauge the campus climate related 
to sexual assault. A survey conducted 
by the Association of American 
Universities found that 14.6 percent 
of University students experienced 
nonconsensual sexual contact since 
coming to college.

“22.8 percent of (female) students 

identify as survivors of sexual assault 
… so you could have a 100-person 
class and 22 people with you are 
survivors … It affects everyone, 
regardless of identity.”

As a likely pre-health student 

in a science heavy major, I don’t 
get a lot of choices when it comes 
to academics. It’ll be helpful to 
take these, says my adviser. You’ll 
need to take these, say graduate 
schools. Within courses is even 
worse. Introductory science and 
math courses essentially operate on 
the pedagogical model of read this, 
attend this lecture, do this problem 
set, take this exam, rinse, repeat. 
The only real choice is how many 
hours of the day I want to spend with 
my head buried rereading a chapter 
or doing another problem set.

Hundreds of years of higher 

education have told us this is how 
it must be. College learning is 
supposed to be all about guided 
learning in how to teach ourselves. 
We all learn in our own unique 
ways, so it is up to us to figure out 
how to absorb the material. Exams 
exist to make sure we have learned 
the material we are supposed to 
have learned.

Common sense about how we 

actually learn dictates otherwise. 
As the old adage goes, you haven’t 
learned until you have failed. But 
the standard grading model of just 
totaling up points received and 
dividing it by points possible flies in 
the face of this. If you actually fail 
an assessment, there is no way to 
demonstrate in your grade that you 
have learned from your mistakes; 
that mark of failure will always 
have an enormous impact on that 
final calculation. Sure, practice 
exams and smaller assignments are 
designed to simulate that learning 

through failure, but they never 
come with the same type of directed 
feedback that accompanies an exam 
or essay grade.

There’s a different way to think 

about 
learning 
called 
gameful 

learning, and a project funded by 
the University’s Third Century 
Initiative, the Digital Education 
Initiative, the School of Education 
and the School of Information 
seeks to harness it. It seeks to 
expand the reach of gameful 
learning, 
a 
pedagogical 
model 

built on the principles that grades 
should be built from zero and not 
a ratio, and that learning should 
feature multiple paths to success, 
not just a single list of homework 
and exams. Gameful learning at 
the University is built on top of 
the learning management system 
Gradecraft, 
which 
features 
a 

grade predictor that lets students 
experiment with different options 
for success, and constantly gives 
them opportunities to reevaluate 
their chosen method.

This semester, I am taking a course 

that uses this model, Honors 240: 
The Games We Play. It does happen 
to have the added benefit of being a 
class about games graded as a game, 
but the gameful model certainly 
shows its stripes. Its gameful model 
empowers me to make choices about 
how I want to learn the material and 
lets me take risks that I might not 
otherwise take.

For example, as part of the 

course’s goal to apply the basic social 
science concepts we’re learning 
to real-world scenarios, I had the 

option to do any combination of 
developing my own empirical study 
of an issue on campus, analyzing 
one aspect of the Department of 
Education’s College Scorecard data 
or writing an essay trying to tie all 
of the individual concepts together. 
I decided to take a risk and spend a 
majority of my time analyzing data, 
and found some really interesting 
results that I would have never had 
seen if it was something I was forced 
to do along with other objectives. I 
also knew that even though I was 
taking a risk by focusing so much of 
my time on one project that could 
potentially lead to uninteresting 
results, or have it not be what my 
professor wanted, I could always 
try something new without risking 
a serious grade deduction. I would 
still have to work harder than if I 
didn’t fail the other assignment, 
but at least my grade might 
 

not suffer.

This type of choice in my learning 

was incredibly empowering. I felt 
so much more ownership over 
my work in the end because I felt 
like I chose to go down this path, 
and it wasn’t something someone 
was forcing me to do just to jump 
through 
some 
next 
proverbial 

hoop. While this model certainly 
can’t work in every educational 
circumstance, it is worth it for 
professors to think about adjusting 
the very model of their classrooms 
if they want their students to think 
the way the real world thinks.

W

hen I was in high school, the most 
common Facebook cover pictures 
I saw were poses with friends 

or 
random 
aesthetic 

succulents. Now, it seems, 
pictures with parents and 
siblings have dominated 
my news feed. From my 
experience, my peers and 
I have been opting more 
for #MimosasWithMom, 
rather than the infamous 
#foodporn 
or 
#nature. 

Life at college, it seems, is 
instilling in students value 
and pride for their families 
rather than despoiling it.

My freshman year, I think I thought pretty 

much the opposite. Everybody on campus 
seemed to be studying and working all the 
time, barely having enough time to think of 
their families at home at all, let alone call or 
visit them. When students weren’t studying, 
they were partying, which seemed like 
the last thing someone who highly values 
their parents would spend their expensive 
university time doing. My second semester 
freshman year, I spent exactly one night in 
Bloomfield Hills. One night!

Granted, I spent my Spring Break in 

Atlanta participating in Alternative Spring 
Break, but the fact that I didn’t think about or 
miss my family at home much at all supported 
my idea that college was a time for students to 
grow apart from their families. 

However, this year, after noticing the 

opposite trend, I caught on to reason why 
I didn’t notice it my first two semesters 
at Michigan: I didn’t have to go home to 
Bloomfield Hills for a family recharge because 
I had so much family already here with me. My 
sister, two years older, was already a University 
student when I came here — I didn’t have to 
go home or call my parents to necessarily get 
that family-values feeling. Every time I felt 
stressed or needed to talk to family, I would 
call or text her to meet up for a bit at Bert’s in 
the UGLi.

For example, when I really needed someone 

to be there for me in times of personal distress, 
I didn’t have to go all the way home to see 
someone who was unconditionally there for 
me. Instead, I just had to walk five minutes to 
meet up with my sister at a coffee shop. While 
I imagined I was floating away from my 
family life, I was, in fact, just developing it in 
different, more adaptable ways. I didn’t have 
to be living at home with my parents to know 
that I had the support network I needed.

This 
Thanksgiving 
break, 
some 
high 

school friends put together a reunion event of 
sorts. The Facebook event was actually titled 
“Re-onion 2: the onioning.” On the day of the 
event, our friend who goes to Princeton posted:

“OK, I’m the worst, but I can’t make it. I’m 

leaving tomorrow morning and I only have a 
day left with my parents and (sibling name). 
frown emoticon. I really suck because I had 
the day changed for this event. Please leave 
all hate messages below:”

At any point before this year, I almost 

certainly would have actually left at least 
some sort of passive remark in the comments 
about how we changed the event date just for 
her, and how I haven’t seen her in months 
yada yada yada (I used to be — still am? — a 
high-maintenance friend). 

But this year, after almost three semesters 

in college, I can totally understand where 
she’s coming from. While at face value it may 
seem that university students are drifting 
away from their parents and siblings, they 
are simply developing a more complex 
relationship. I’m no longer just living at home, 
in need of my parents’ and siblings’ constant 
support. Instead, I know I have that support 
even when I’m far away, and my family knows 
the same from me. Therefore, when I do 
actually go home and physically spend time 
with them, that time is more precious than 
ever, and I think many college students also 
appreciate that added value.

So what does this mean for our home 

life? Succinctly, home life has become a 
precious, almost nostalgic time to take selfies 
with Mom and genuinely enjoy being in the 
presence of one’s family. I honestly feel like 
I’ve become so much less of a brat than I was 
in high school (but I really couldn’t have 
been more of one, so that’s not saying much), 
because being away at school forces me to 
appreciate every minute.

School life away from home is now 

a time when I’m physically separated 
from my family, but feel the support (and 
expectations!) more than ever. And if I’m 
ever unsure about that, I can give them a call 
anytime and know they’re willing to take an 
hour out of their day just to talk.

I love going on Snapchat while on break. 

During holiday time, rather than expecting 
to feel FOMO when opening friends’ stories, 
I can always look forward to cute sibling 
pictures and posts of gratitude for parents. 
Though at times University life is separating 
us from these family moments, in actuality, it 
only makes us value them even more.

Valuing family time

What is normal?

T

here 
were 
only 
four 

sentences on the sheet of 
paper in front of us. My 

classmates and I sat there stumped 
for a moment, struggling to answer 
a few questions. 
Floating among 
all 
the 
white 

space 
we 

weren’t entirely 
sure 
how 
to 

fill 
was 
the 

question “What 
is normal?”

Tossing aside 

my initial (and 
mildly sarcastic) 
reaction to ask 
if 
the 
prompt 

was a trick ques-
tion, we were able to jot down a few 
phrases and a few words to com-
plete the exercise. This particular 
question, though, resurfaced when 
I traveled back home for Thanks-
giving break. Home had always 
had its own definition of “normal” 
— a respective series of expecta-
tions about how to act, what to do 
and the “proper” order to perform 
these actions. I — for 22 years — had 
disagreed with the vast majority of 
them. I didn’t tend to fit home’s def-
inition, and more often than not, I 
wasn’t necessarily sure I wanted to.

Yet as I returned to a place where 

I continually felt I was deviating 
from the norm, my mind sudden-
ly became preoccupied with the 
notion of normal. Given the ambi-
guity of what the next year — or 
even the next few months — will 
hold, a prescribed route with some 
sort of direction to follow was an 
attractive option. Normal promised 
a degree of certainty and stability. 
Normal would provide a measure of 
where exactly I “should be.” How-
ever, as I began to worry whether 
I was falling behind or making a 
mistake, I began to really consider 
what has actually constituted nor-
mal up to this point in my life.

Throughout the years, it was 

normal for me to be highly aware 
of my status as a woman, and if I 
ever began to forget about this label 
— and all of the limitations society 
entwines into it — I was promptly 
reminded. “Because you’re the girl” 
was the customary response when-
ever I asked for any explanation 
as to why my parents hesitated to 
let me do certain things my broth-
ers were able to do without ques-
tion. With this phrase came the 
acknowledgement that I needed to 
follow special precautions in order 
to obtain a certain degree of inde-
pendence my brothers and male 

friends seemed to acquire easily. 
Going to a party, walking back from 
the library late at night, jogging in 
a secluded area, spending a day in 
a bigger city, going for a run in the 
evening, going to a concert or driv-
ing across the state were endeavors 
that filled those around me with 
visible discomfort if I mentioned I 
was going alone. These endeavors 
typically required a great deal of 
negotiation and reassurance before-
hand, and an even greater degree of 
self-awareness and vigilance dur-
ing the time. Both then and now, 
my friends and family display some 
anxiety at the idea of me venturing 
out alone in these scenarios. But it’s 
still a fairly common phenomenon 
for concerns about these excursions 
to instantly evaporate whenever I 
mention I’ll be in the company of 
my male best friend.

Each time I open my laptop or 

turn on a tele-
vision, 
I’m 

bombarded 
by 

what the media 
portrays as nor-
mal. 
Normal 

is 
constantly 

questioning 
and 
critiqu-

ing 
numerous 

forms of media 
because 
I’m 

tired of hearing my body compared 
to some variety of amorphous 
fruit, especially when the bushel 
depicted in society still looks pretty 
homogenous. Searching through 
Photoshopped images on various 
platforms for one with familiar 
proportions is an all-too-common 
activity — one that regrettably pro-
duces few results. And as I do this, 
my friends struggle to find valid 
representations of their race, sexu-
ality or disability in the media they 
watch, listen to and read.

I’ve read innumerable articles 

about “leaning in,” “having it all” 
and alleviating the wage gap. In 
my column, I’ve argued for initia-
tives to diminish gender inequality. 
Despite all of this, I know any hur-
dles I encounter as I try to navigate 
the professional world as an indi-
vidual from a lower socioeconomic 
background will only be magnified 
by my identity as a woman. Accept-
ing the norm involves the realiza-
tion that until things change, I’ll 
most likely find myself smashed 
up against a glass ceiling holding 
onto about 77 cents where a dol-
lar should be. Normal is knowing 
that dressing in more androgy-
nous clothing over the years is not 
merely a style choice, but a poten-

tial strategy to avoid being classi-
fied and stereotyped by my gender 
in the workplace.

One particular norm permeating 

each of my days is the continuous 
internal debate between saying too 
little and saying too much. At points, 
it’s simply holding my tongue dur-
ing a conversation when it takes a 
turn toward the reasoning “that’s 
just the way things are,” and when 
a dissenting opinion will most likely 
be dismissed as a “feminist rant.” It’s 
swallowing my anger and frustration 
when a passing car volleys catcalls 
as I walk across an intersection on 
my way to class. Conversely, a sort 
of insecurity sets in the moments 
when I feel like I haven’t contributed 
enough to a conversation. It leaves 
me wondering whether my silence 
was perceived as shyness, a lack of 
knowledge on the topic or just a cold, 
judgmental persona. Then, in rare 

moments 
with 

certain 
people, 

I begin to worry 
I’ve monopolized 
the conversation, 
and an unneces-
sary apology fol-
lows. In fact, the 
word “sorry” has 
assumed a prom-
inent place in my 
vocabulary, act-

ing as a preface to far too many ques-
tions and as an entrance to far too 
many conversations.

While these instances and expe-

riences define the norms in my 
life, normal is a subjective con-
cept, where some definitions are 
undoubtedly far more privileged 
than others. Normal, in my expe-
rience, has been presented as soci-
ety’s agreed-upon codes of what’s 
acceptable.

Looking back at the question 

from class, the idealist in me wants 
to say normal doesn’t exist. As 
much as I want to point out that the 
concept is socially constructed, I 
can’t deny that women are held up 
to various definitions of what’s nor-
mal — very often ones we’re never 
given a say in at all. In class, we 
focused on two approaches one can 
take in regard to normality. Either 
you can embrace the notion of nor-
mal, or you can combat it. If these 
norms and expectations are just a 
few examples of what women can 
expect if they embrace and accept 
it, society seriously needs to defy 
its own definition of “normal” and 
start redefining.

ANDREA CUAMATZI | VIEWPOINT

I was 16 when I left home to study abroad 

for the first time. Right before I left for the 
airport, my grandma said goodbye to me in 
a way only she could do: Que la Virgencita 
te cuide y te acompañe — May Our Lady of 
Guadalupe be with you at all times. As a 
farewell gift, she put a gold charm on my neck 
with Our Lady of Guadalupe on one side and 
my name on the other.

Until that moment, I had always taken 

for granted the significance of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe. I was born and raised as a Catholic 
in Mexico, and Our Lady of Guadalupe has 
not only been a symbol present in my family, 
my church and my Catholic high school, but 
also a historical figure used in war emblems, 
constitutional seals and famous literature.

In the Mexican community, Dec. 12 

represents a day of gathering and hope, 
a moment of union and faith. Classes are 
cancelled, Mom and Dad are off work, and 
churches are opened. There will be family 
gatherings full of tamales and hot chocolate. 
The significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe 
goes beyond religious celebrations; she is a 
symbol of culture and tradition.

Why are Mexicans so devoted to this 

figure? Our Lady of Guadalupe appeared as 
an application to Juan Diego, a native Aztec, 
in 1531 — a period of annihilation of the Aztec 
Empire and of imposition of the Spanish 
culture and religion. The Aztecs were known 
as a devoted polytheistic community. It was 
not until Our Lady of Guadalupe made her 
apparitions that indigenous people started 
accepting the Catholic faith as their own. She 
appeared in a way Aztec people could identify 

with. The color of her skin was neither white 
nor indigenous; it was a blend of both. She 
used Nahuatl, not Spanish, to communicate 
with Juan Diego.

She is replete with symbolism. Her pink 

robe, her blue stellated mantle, her name 
“Guadalupe,” 
her 
facial 
expressions 
— 

everything is full of meaning for the Aztec 
community. Instead of imposing a new, 
unfamiliar set of values and beliefs, she 
acknowledges the richness of a culture, 
blending the Catholic faith with Aztec beliefs. 
The message of Our Lady of Guadalupe 
is a message of love and protection. She 
acknowledges those in the margins who don’t 
seem to have a voice.

The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe 

among the Mexican community in the United 
States carries the same meaning it carried 
500 years ago in the Spanish-Aztec context. 
It reminds us of the value every human being 
has beyond nationality, social class or racial 
privileges, portraying that the reconciliation 
of a heterogeneous and complex society is 
possible. This message is just as important 
today with our struggles with immigration as 
it was in the time of Juan Diego. In that spirit of 
inclusion, the Mexican community welcomes 
everyone to join us in the celebration of Our 
Lady of Guadalupe this Dec. 12 at 7 p.m. at 
St. Mary Student Parish. The mass will be in 
Spanish, and English guides will be available. 
Directly following mass, all are invited to 
celebrate with traditional Mexican food and 
Mariachis.

TV REVIEW
‘Dead’ disappoints

Mid-season finale 
of AMC series is its 

worst yet

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

The concept of a “mid-season 

finale” has traditionally been 
helpful for “The Walking Dead,” 
a show primar-
ily made up of 
eight-episode 
arcs. 
Each 

mid-season 
finale since the 
third 
season 

has featured a 
game-changing 
moment; while 
the third sea-
son left us won-
dering whether 
Darryl 
(Nor-

man 
Reedus, 

“Sky”) or Merle (Michael Rook-
er, “Henry: Portrait of a Serial 
Killer”) would survive their bat-
tle to the death, the fourth and 
fifth mid-season finales killed 
off main characters and scat-
tered the show’s characters to 
the wind, with no destination in 
sight.

As this season began to 

unfold, it quickly became clear 
that 
the 
entire 
half-season 

would take place over a com-
pressed time rate, only a few 
days. That was an appeal-
ing idea, especially because it 
would allow the show to tell a 
self-contained arc with a great-
er sense of immediacy. Unfor-
tunately, there’s hardly any 
urgency to be found in “Start 
to Finish,” the show’s weakest 
mid-season finale yet. There’s 
no real cliffhanger in the end; 
the story simply stops in the 
middle of what it’s doing, letting 
us wonder for a couple months 
what the outcome of the cur-
rent big zombie battle will be. 
As a structural experiment, the 
time compression of the sixth 
season has failed, resulting in a 
four-episode stretch of boring 
episodes without even a finale 
to coax the season back to life.

The episode either delays or 

entirely eschews all the big out-
comes viewers were waiting for: 

a fatal confrontation between 
Carl (Chandler Riggs, “Mercy”) 
and 
Ron 
(Austin 
Abrams, 

“Paper Towns”), the emotional 
reunion of Glenn (Steven Yeun, 
“I Origins”) and Maggie (Lauren 
Cohan, “The Vampire Diaries”), 
the reveal of the identity of the 
person pleading for help over the 
radio and the arrival of Darryl, 
Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green, 
“Once Upon A Time”) and Abra-
ham (Michael Cudlitz, “South-
land”). Most notably, though, the 
massive zombie attack, instead 
of delivering a surge of action 
and high stakes, is presented as 
a minor background nuisance 
throughout the episode.

The episode, at least, isn’t as 

bad as the season’s worst install-
ment, “Now.” There are inter-
esting threads here. Deanna’s 
(Tovah Feldshuh, “Holocaust”) 
death is appropriately heroic as 
she finally musters up the cour-
age to fight back against the 
walkers, and her final conver-
sation with Michonne (Danai 
Gurira, “Mother of George”) 
hopefully promises a bigger 
role for the latter after a half-
season that has largely ignored 
her. Carol (Melissa McBride, 
“The Reconstruction of Wil-
liam Zero”) and Morgan (Len-
nie James, “Low Winter Sun”), 
the most compelling characters 
of the show, have a fun fight 
based on their disagreement 
over whether to keep their mur-
derous prisoner alive.

Still, even these two theo-

retically compelling subplots 
are marred by old issues and 
new frustrating developments. 
Deanna’s death doesn’t have 
nearly as much impact as it 
would last season, since she has 
spent most of this season in a dull 
PTSD-induced stupor, staring 
blankly at the walkers threat-
ening to kill her and repeatedly 
being saved by Rick (Andrew 

Lincoln, “Love Actually”). And 
while Carol and Morgan’s fight 
would typically be fascinat-
ing, it feels petty amid a mas-
sive zombie attack. Their fight 
also ends in a painfully predict-
able manner, with the prisoner 
escaping. This development in 
particular is frustrating because 
it proves Carol right in her mer-
ciless attitude toward prisoners. 
“The Walking Dead” is a show 
too often bogged down by pes-
simism and ruthlessness, which 
is why Morgan’s optimistic no-
killing policy is so refreshing 
this season. A character being 
justifiably merciful for a change 
would give the show a neces-
sary shock to the system, but the 
prisoner proving Morgan wrong 
only serves as another unneces-
sary reminder that the only way 
to survive is by being merciless.

The rest of the episode fea-

tures boring scenes of little 
consequence. Tara (Alanna Mas-
terson, “Men at Work”), Eugene 
(Josh McDermitt, “Retired at 
35”) and Rosita (Christian Ser-
ratos, “Ned’s Declassified School 
Survival Guide”) hide from the 
zombies for a while, then break 
out and fail to save Denise (Mer-
ritt Wever, “Nurse Jackie”) from 
being abducted by the escaped 
prisoner. There’s also a fight 
between Carl and Ron, foreshad-
owed by last episode’s falsely 
intense cliffhanger. If there was 
ever a real risk of Ron killing 
Carl, this fight could be thrill-
ing, but the pacing of the scene 
is listless and obligatory, as if 
everyone involved knows both 
annoying kids are going to make 
it out alive. Besides, in the wake 
of the kerfuffle with Glenn sur-
viving, the odds are against the 
main character’s son dying any-
time soon.

Though the sixth season of 

“The Walking Dead” started 
strong and featured some stand-
out episodes, the past four have 
seen it backsliding into stag-
nancy, recalling the weak early 
seasons. Hopefully the upcom-
ing second half of the season 
will use the comics’ deep well 
of story for some more consis-
tently fun episodes. But if the 
mid-season finale is any indica-
tor, there’s a long way to go to 
rebuild.

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

Hamilton, Ruth & I
I

’ve been thinking a lot 
recently about history. 
How stories are told and 

repeated. How people become 
figures and figures become 
idols. How 
others are 
forgot-
ten, their 
lives only 
lived once 
in their 
own bod-
ies rather 
than in the 
memories of 
generations.

This newfound, morbid pre-

occupation with legacy? All due 
to one man: our least-appreci-
ated founding father, Alexan-
der Hamilton. Good ol’ Alex is 
the subject of a new Broadway 
musical that is breaking rev-
enue records and taking over 
Spotify accounts. “Hamilton” is 
a hip-hop opera composed by, 
written and starring buoyant 
auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda, 
creator of Tony-award-winning 
“In the Heights.” It tells Ham-
ilton’s incredible unsung story, 
from a young orphan living 
in the Caribbean, as George 
Washington’s aide de camp in 
the revolution, the creator of 
the Federalist Papers, the first 
Secretary of the Treasury (and 
creator of big bad Wall Street 
as we know it), to millions of 
other accomplishments, so 
much that Miranda has to rap 
in order to get them all out. It’s 
really, really good.

The final song of the musi-

cal, taking place after Hamil-
ton’s death, is a soft, wandering 
ballad sung by his ever-patient 
wife Eliza. “Who Lives, Who 
Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” 
is Eliza’s promise to continue 
working in her husband’s 
honor, so that he is never for-
gotten; it’s also Lin-Manuel’s 
attempt to remember the 
female voices in Hamilton’s 
life, those that Hamilton him-
self seemed to often forget.

“Hamilton” is unapolo-

getically the story of a man 
— a man who is brilliant, rash, 
tireless, selfish and ultimately 
vulnerable. And he is a man 
in a world ruled by men, sur-
rounded by male compatriots 

and adversaries. The women in 
his life are love interests; one a 
confidant, one a supporter, one 
a temptress. Lin-Manuel does 
what he can with the little his-
tory recorded of the women in 
Hamilton’s life, but ultimately 
what we know of them is only 
in reference to Hamilton. His-
tory doesn’t tell their story.

***
As I obsessively listened to 

“Hamilton,” I was also read-
ing Irin Carmon and Shana 
Knizhnik’s recent biography of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Fueled 
by Tumblr public policy nerds, 
82-year-old Supreme Court 
Justice Ginsberg has become 
something of a celebrity over 
the past few years, most sig-
nificantly after a few blister-
ing dissents in conservative 
decisions made by the court. 
Notorious RBG, as the Internet 
calls her, is Millennial-famous 
now, but this octogenarian was 
badass long before we all were 
born.

This — this — was a story 

that needed to be told.

A woman who passed 

groundbreaking cases in equal 
rights for women and men 
when it came to family leave 
and employment discrimina-
tion, who intelligently (and 
presciently) argued against 
Roe v. Wade, believing that a 
woman’s right to choose was 
only secure when there wasn’t 
an opportunity for loopholes 
in the law. A woman who was 
only one of two other women 
in her class at Columbia Law, 
yet who graduated first in her 
class. A woman of whom her 
daughter once fondly spoke: 
“Mommy does the thinking, 
and daddy does the cooking.” 
A modern marvel, a winged 
herald.

It was thrilling to read about 

a woman who had shaped the 
country during my own life-
time. In the constant rebirth 
of a nation, she is in some ways 
a founding mother, helping 
develop a new system to foster 
our diverse, complex country. 
It was refreshing to read of 
her husband Marty’s constant 
support and deference to her 
intelligence and industrious-
ness. It was refreshing too, to 

see Marty, a wildly successful 
tax attorney in his own right, 
be discussed only in reference 
to Ruth. Because this was her 
story.

***
I sat in the movie theater, 

tears pooling into my woolen 
scarf, Mom holding my hand 
tight. “Brooklyn,” about a 
young Irish girl immigrating to 
the United States in the 1950s 
and starring the luminous 
Saorise Ronan, wasn’t an espe-
cially tragic movie. I wasn’t 
crying because of a great death 
or misfortune that had fallen 
upon Eilis, who was smart and 
scrappy and thriving.

I was crying because I was 

able to see myself in her story. 
While there have been many 
films created about those 
immigrating to the United 
States, this one is different. 
Eilis’ freckled face fills every 
frame of the film, as she says 
goodbye to her family, becomes 
seasick on the boat over and 
homesick once there, as she 
speaks in her meek brogue at 
the department store where she 
works. As she falls in love, and 
as she makes achingly difficult 
decisions. This is not a fam-
ily saga, nor even a two-sided 
romance. This is purely Eilis’s 
story.

Based on Colm Tóibín’s novel 

of the same name, “Brooklyn” 
is complete fiction. Eilis isn’t 
a Ruth, nor is she a Hamilton, 
real figures with real impacts 
on American history. In a 
world where the stories of the 
powerful are told most often, 
and men’s a large percentage 
of those, Eilis’s story is small. 
But as another young Irish girl 
(admittedly a few generations 
removed), who is soon moving 
thousands of miles away from 
her family, Eilis’s story beat 
more powerfully in my chest 
than Hamilton or Ginsburg’s 
triumphs ever could. And I’m 
goddamn grateful someone told 
it, because stories like Eilis’s 
are usually the ones we never 
get to hear.

‘10 Bullets’ shows 
empathy for subjects

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

After Michael Dunn, a white 

man, shot and killed Jordan Davis, 
a Black 17-year-old boy, in a gas 
station parking 
lot in Florida, 
Jordan’s father 
Ron 
received 

a 
text 
from 

Trayvon Mar-
tin’s 
father, 

welcoming 
him to a “club” 
that none of 
them 
wanted 

to be in.

The documentary “3 ½ Min-

utes, 10 Bullets,” directed by Marc 
Silver, (“Who is Dayani Cristal?”) 
chronicles the trial of Michael 
Dunn in 2012. Unlike the sev-
eral other recent cases involv-
ing young Black people killed by 
whites, there was no dispute over 
whether Dunn was guilty of kill-
ing Davis — which he did after 
asking Davis to turn that “thug 
music” down. Dunn’s defense 
relies on his insistence that under 
Florida’s stand-your-ground laws: 
He was in the right, as he thought 
Davis had a shotgun. But when 
Dunn’s then-fiancé Rhonda Rouer 
is cross-examined, she says, in a 
wavery voice, that Dunn had never 
told her anything about Davis hav-
ing a gun. No weapons of any kind 
were found in Davis’s car. At one 
point, we hear Dunn complaining 
to Rouer that he feels he’s being 
victim-blamed in the same way a 
scantily-clad woman might be.

Names like Trayvon Martin 

and Michael Brown are whis-
pered or shouted throughout 

this documentary as it rightly 
puts the trial in context of the 
exploding outrage over racial 
biases (whether conscious or 
subconscious) that play a part 
in the killings of Black people 
in America. For example, the 
documentary adds context by 
focusing on both the news cov-
erage of this trial as well as the 
trial itself. In light of recent 
events, this documentary feels 
more subtle and controlled in its 
representation of Dunn, when it 
could have very harshly thrown 
him into sharp relief. The doc-
umentary, 
though 
focusing 

heavily on how racial prejudice 
played into this tragic event and 
the subsequent trials, also dedi-
cates a substantial amount of 
time to the second-amendment 
rhetoric and discourse on gun 
laws that surrounded this case.

The documentary pulls on 

our emotions without cheapen-
ing its story; we see Jordan’s par-
ents crying at their table, trying 
to figure out how this could have 
happened five minutes from their 
home, when he was with a group 
of “good” boys.

Aside from the interviews 

with Jordan’s parents, the most 
riveting moments of the docu-
mentary are the interviews with 
Jordan’s friends, all young Black 
teenagers. They’re fully aware 
of the camera and the context 
in which they’re being inter-
viewed. They’re sad, but they’re 
not confused. They know why 
Dunn pulled out his gun, and 
why the first jury didn’t agree 
on a first-degree murder charge. 
They talk about the racial over-
tones of the shooting and the 

trial more than anyone else in 
the documentary does. One of 
Jordan’s friends says, shaking 
his head, “ ‘Thug’ is the new 
n-word.”

The documentary is uneven in 

its coverage of the first and sec-
ond trials, focusing more on the 
first, but the courtroom scenes 
are captivating. It ends with 
the fact that Dunn was given a 
life sentence without parole for 
murdering Jordan Davis and an 
additional 90 years for attempt-
ed murder of Leland Brunson, 
Tevin Thompson and Tommie 
Stornes, Jordan’s friends who 
were also in the car.

“3 ½ Minutes, 10 Bullets” 

isn’t exceptional in terms of 
aesthetic 
cinematography 
or 

directorial choices. The music 
sometimes feels out of place, and 
often the interview audio bites 
or recordings of phone calls are 
played over extraneous shots of 
cars driving on highways. But 
you get the feeling that the peo-
ple involved in making it really 
couldn’t care less about that. 
They know that what is impor-
tant is the story and the context 
in which this story unfortunate-
ly unfolded.

TV NOTEBOOK
Memories of Macy’s

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

For 89 years, Thanksgiving 

morning has meant one thing: 
Macy’s 
Thanksgiving 
Day 

parade.

Rain or shine, it’s a tradition 

as holy as turkey, cranberry 
sauce, football and your drunk 
uncle’s political rants. Because 
whether you’re a 10-year-old kid 
or a senior home from college, 
watching the balloons in person 
on New York City’s Sixth Avenue 
or streaming it from NBC on 
a favorite sofa at home, you’re 
guaranteed to get a bit emotional 
when Santa Claus floats by for 
the grand finale.

And when Mariah Carey 

sings “All I Want for Christmas 
Is You” from atop a stack of 
Christmas presents, wearing a 
cherry-red ball gown and a fur 
shawl, you might just burst out 
in tears.

Needless to say, the parade 

is a Thanksgiving tradition that 
millions of Americans have 
adopted as their own. Though 
the famed march to Macy’s 
flagship store in New York City 
has shortened, condensed to 
just two and a half miles from 
the five-mile route of previous 
years, the parade continues to 
blow up bigger every year — no 
pun intended — and 2015 was no 
exception.

Hosted 
by 
Matt 
Lauer, 

Savannah Guthrie and Al Roker 
of NBC’s “Today” show, this 
year’s march brought the usual 
favorites: the long-legged New 
York City Rockettes, Snoopy and 
Woodstock, 
600 
plus-person 

dance crews, marching bands and 
that group of old geezers with 
bagpipes, all snaking through a 
crowd of three million spectators.

Different from previous years, 

however, was the not-so-subtle 
hint of heavy surveillance, a 
precaution taken in response to 
the recent bombings in Paris. 
The New York Times reported 
that close to 2,500 police officers 
lined the streets, both in uniform 
and undercover, watching for 
any suspicious activity amongst 
the crowd. Thankfully, like the 
unseasonably warm weather, the 
parade proceeded as perfectly as 
everyone hoped. The only glitch, 
according to the Times, was a 
41-year-old man who violated 
city code by flying a drone near 
Central Park. 

Drone aside, the air was filled 

with whimsy. Along with Snoopy, 
the oldest recurring balloon on 
display (appearing 38 times since 
being introduced in 1968), familiar 
friendly giants included Hello 
Kitty (introduced in 1976), Ronald 
McDonald 
(1987), 
Pokemon’s 

Pikachu 
(2001), 
Spongebob 

Squarepants (2004), “Adventure 
Time” ’s Finn and Jake (2013) 
and the Red Power Ranger (2014). 
New to the crew this year was 
Scrat, the lovable and frantic 
squirrel from “Ice Age,” who 
floated through the air clutching 
— what else? — his precious acorn. 
Red from the “Angry Birds” video 
game also flew for the first time, 
in anticipation of “The Angry 
Birds Movie” coming to theaters 
in May.

Hovering below the balloons 

was the real action: the musical 
performances and dance acts. For 
as much as I love a giant inflatable 
Spongebob, 
watching 
Panic! 

At the Disco (“I Write Sins Not 
Tragedies”) on a Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles float is a bit more 
exciting.

In 
the 
past, 
Macy’s 
has 

attracted artists from across the 
country and across generations 
— from Hilary Duff (2003) and 

the Kidz Bop Kids (2012), to the 
Beach Boys (2005) and KISS 
(2014). Though almost everyone 
lip syncs, wearing microphones 
for show — parade acoustics are 
pretty terrible — the singing’s not 
the focal point.

Really, we’re all watching to 

see what float the stars arrive 
on and what holiday-chic outfit 
they’re sporting.

This year, Mariah Carey, the 

queen 
of 
Christmas 
herself, 

won 
best-dressed 
and 
best 

performance hands down. (I’m 
biased, I know, but it’s officially 
the holiday season after all!) 
Other strong showings were 
Jordin Sparks, who sang “Right 
Here Right Now” dressed in an 
on-point cranberry pea coat; 
Shawn Mendes, who performed 
“Stitches” 
while 
adorably 

steering a ship of kiddy pirates; 
and the “610 Stompers,” posing in 
short shorts and sweat bands like 
an army of “Juno”-era Michael 
Ceras, who killed a hilariously 
impressive step routine. Along 
with Panic! at the Disco, the 
Plain White T’s also appeared, 
giving us all some nostalgia for 
the 2000s.

But most deserving of praise 

was the troupe of spirited high 
school cheerleaders, dancers and 
marching band members who 
never stopped smiling, though 
they’d probably been locked 
in tight formation since 6 a.m. 
Props for doing your thing while 
the rest of us were in college-
induced comas. 

For me, Macy’s Thanksgiving 

Day

thing that I didn’t even really 

have to think about, I just felt 
like I wanted to do it, so I did 
it,” Andres said.

Andres — who was in St. 

Paul, supervising the premiere 
of his new piano concerto The 
Blind Banister — studied piano 
with Eleanor Hancock in New 
York for many years, from his 
childhood through high school, 
before becoming more serious 
about composition in their later 
time together. Andres began 
his serious composition studies 
during high school, taking les-
sons through the Juilliard pre-
college program.

“I guess the composition 

sort of gradually became more 
and more important to me as I 
studied it more seriously, until 
the writing and the playing 
were sort of on equal footing, 
and feeding into each other,” 
Andres said.

“After high school I decided 

to go to Yale, rather than go to 
a conservatory,” Andres said of 
his post high school education, 
explaining how he earned both 
his undergraduate degree and 
master’s degree from the uni-
versity.

“It was just sort of a gut 

feeling I had at the time that I 
would have found a conserva-
tory kind of stifling,” he said 
of his decision to attend a uni-
versity rather than a conser-
vatory. “I don’t do well with 
bureaucracy or authority … and 
conservatories tend to be very 
rigid atmospheres … (addition-
ally) I always knew I wanted to 
be a professional musician, but I 
also wanted to study more than 
just music.”

The piece being performed 

this Wednesday was composed 
by Andres for the Takács Quar-
tet, which was formed in 1975 
and is the quartet-in-residence 
at the University of Colorado 
Boulder. Discussing the piece, 
Strong Language, Andres spoke 
about its inspiration.

“In many ways it was inspired 

directly by the quartet’s play-
ing. I went to hear the Takács 
Quartet a little less than a year 
ago in New York, and I knew 
I was about to start writing a 
piece for them, so I was kind of 
looking for things … that made 
their playing especially their 
own,” Andres said.

“And what impressed me 

about their playing was their 
sense of gesture — being con-
veyed by four different people 
— that was so unified and so 
clear, so that it almost seemed 
like the music was taking on 
these physical forms,” the com-
poser explained. “I got the idea 
that the piece would have these 
very simple gestures that would 
be elaborated upon and varied 
over the course of the three 
movements.”

Andres composed the cen-

tral movement of the piece 
before the first and last, begin-
ning with music that was “very 
still and quiet, and then gradu-
ally expanded outward in both 
directions, little by little, so 
that by the time it ended … it 
was this very grand and expres-
sive, (with a) leaping melody,” 
the composer said.

According to Andres, the first 

movement of Strong Language 
works in a similar way. The 
movement is built on initially 
unaccompanied 
arch-shaped 

melodies which repeat and 
grow more elaborate through-
out the movement.

“Each time that melody is 

repeated these kind of sub-
strata, these layers of decayed 
material kind of pile up under-
neath it, so each time the mel-
ody gets more embellished and 
more harmonized, and more 
just kind of noisy,” Andres said.

“That movement is called 

‘Middens,’ which is a type of 
archeological 
site 
which 
is 

basically an ancient trash pile 
— this kind of process of lay-
ers piling up over the ages,” the 
composer said.

Andres draws on classical 

tradition for the structure of 
Strong Language’s last move-
ment. The final movement is 
“a chaconne, or a passacaglia, 
based on a sequence of chords 
in the bass that are repeated 
in a cycle,” Andres said. The 
chaconne is a variation form 
that was very popular during 
the Baroque period in the 17th 
and 18th centuries, but fell out 
of favor until composers such 
as Britten and Shostakovich 
revived it in the mid 1900s.

“It starts with hearing those 

chords and these very quiet, 
diffuse noises in the upper 
strings,” Andres said. “And 
eventually those noises fill in to 
become this perpetual motion 
cycling 
rhythm. 
The 
lower 

strings take on a melodic role 
underneath that, and that ends 
up leading to these reminis-
cences of the other two move-
ments in the end.”

Composed in the spring of 

this year, Strong Language was 
premiered less than a month 
ago by the Takács Quartet, who 
will be performing it again on 
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Rack-
ham Auditorium. Also on the 
program will be favorites from 
the 18th and 19th centuries, by 
Haydn and Dvorák, respectively.

LITERATURE COLUMN

Literary hipness

A

s soon as the calendar flips 
to Dec. 1, I begin to ponder 
my upcoming New Year’s 

resolutions. For most of my life, 
my resolutions were oriented on 
self-improve-
ment. My 
past resolu-
tions include 
“stop losing 
shit,” “stop 
being late 
to literally 
everything” 
and “stop 
eating 
so much 
Nutella.” These resolutions had 
an unsurprising expiration date of 
about a month.

But in 2015, I made a new 

kind of resolution. I decided that 
instead of trying to change myself, 
I would plunge into something 
that I actually love to do. My 2015 
resolution was to read a book a 
week for the whole year, 52 books 
in total.

Of course, when the person 

with whom you’re negotiat-
ing resolutions with is yourself, 
it’s easy to become indulgent. I 
quickly realized during the finals 
of winter semester that there 
would be some weeks when I 
just couldn’t swing it. So I made 
up for the school year lapses in 
excess over the summer, furiously 
reading when I should have been 
selling ice cream in an non-air-
conditioned shack in August.

And December has arrived 

again. When I realized this col-
umn was coming out on Dec. 1, 
I wanted to highlight and share 
all the thoughtful and insight-
ful books that had been written 
and published in 2015. I flipped 
through the planner where I write 
the book of the week on the top of 
the page. I frowned and searched 
again. Out of the 48 books I had 
read so far this year, almost none 
of them came out in 2015.

Looking back on the year, this 

made sense. My freshman year 
of college exposed me to new 
authors and styles. There seemed 
to be an endless number of classics 
that should have been fundamen-
tal to high school reading that 
somehow I had skipped. I wanted 
to read Jeffrey Eugenides, Junot 

Díaz and Joan Didion. I was so 
busy reading the defining books 
of generations before mine that it 
didn’t even occur to me to keep up 
with contemporary fiction.

When I recently realized this 

mistake and all that I had been 
missing, I ran to the library and 
checked out some of what had 
been previously vetted by The 
Washington Post and The Nation-
al Foundation as “The Best Books 
of 2015.”

Thankfully, since I only had a 

few days to read them, the books 
I chose are spectacular works. 
I started with “Girl Waits With 
Gun” by Amy Stewart. Based on 
real events from 1914, the novel 
tells the story of the three Kopp 
sisters who live by themselves 
on a farm. Their lives, previously 
private and quiet, change forever 
when a scurrilous factory owner 
crashes his car into their buggy. 
When the protagonist and leader 
of the sisters, Constance Kopp, 
demands restitution from the 
factory owner, he and his foul 
friends attempt to dissuade her 
with intimidation and threats of 
physical harm. The swaggering 
pursuits of male dominance por-
trayed in this book unfortunately 
have not changed and are still evi-
dent in our society today. The dif-
ference in “Girl Waits With Gun” 
is the entirely badass response of 
the Kopp sisters, especially for 
their time period.

I started “The Turner House,” 

by Angela Flournoy, within min-
utes of finishing “Girl Waits With 
Gun.” While it was necessary 
for me to meet my deadline and 
travel home for Thanksgiving, I 
wouldn’t recommend the rapidity 
of this turnaround. “The Turner 
House” requires and deserves a 
clear head to receive its gifts of 
wonderfully complex characters 
woven into inter-generational 
story lines. The portrayal of the 
Detroit-based African-American 
Turner family begins in their 
house on Yarrow Street when 
Cha-Cha, the oldest of the 13 
Turner children, encounters a 
ghost. or “haint,” in his room. We 
fast-forward through the years 
with them 
— the Turners are all 

grown up with their own demons 
haunting them in every room. 

Their history hinges upon the 
history of Detroit, with each anec-
dote, based on the events of the 
city, illustrating the importance 
Flournoy gives to the phrase “the 
personal is political.” Families like 
the Turners are an underrepre-
sented, but entirely accurate and 
necessary portrayal of the post-
nuclear family in contemporary 
literature.

One of the books I read that 

was published in 2015 was Harp-
er Lee’s “Go Set A Watchman,” 
the controversial prequel to 
“To Kill A Mockingbird.” I have 
already extensively discussed the 
novel in this column (long story 
short: read it, it’s worth it), but 
the book allowed me to see my 
prejudice against contemporary 
fiction. While “Watchman” was 
published in 2015, it had been 
declared a classic long before 
publication. I now see myself for 
what I truly am 
— I confess to 

being woefully unhip to recent 
fiction. I’m only halfway through 
two books that I wanted to read 
for this column, Adam Johnson’s 
“Fortune Smiles” and Sandra 
Newman’s “The Country of Ice 
Cream Star.” Other books that a 
less honest literature columnist 
would have claimed to have read 
would be “Purity” by Jonathan 
Franzen, “H is for Hawk” by 
Helen McDonald and “Serving 
Pleasure” by Alisha Rai, a self-
published erotic novel that has 
garnered a shocking amount 
of literary attention. In 2015, I 
focused on the classics of the 
past when I should have spent 
an equal amount of time looking 
ahead to the future.

But literary hipness is a transi-

tory state. And fortunately, the 
beauty of resolutions is that there’s 
always next year. So for 2016, my 
resolution is, again, to read a book 
a week. The catch is that the book 
has to have been published within 
the last five years. My predic-
tion is that this resolution will 
have everything 
— tears and joy 

and challenges and rewards, but 
mostly just a lot of reading. Check 
back in 12 months.

TV NOTEBOOK
Friendsgiving

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Even though my family immi-

grated from Russia to the United 
States over 20 years ago, American 
traditions haven’t really stuck. I’ve 
missed out on most all-American 
viewing experiences, like “Charlie 
Brown,” football and the Macy’s 
Thanksgiving Day Parade. Instead, 
my family spends the day nurs-
ing our food babies on the couch 
while marathoning all 10 “Friends” 
Thanksgiving episodes. Each year, 
we watch Joey’s head get stuck in a 
turkey, swoon over 2001 Brad Pitt 
and wonder how Monica was able 
to lose 100 pounds in just one year. 
We laugh at the jokes we already 
know the punchlines to and get 
teary-eyed every time we hear, “It’s 
always been you, Rach.” “Friends” 
has filled any void that the all-
American traditions I’ve missed 
out on creating and have made “I’ll 
Be There For You” the theme song 
to my Turkey Day each year.

I don’t know anything about 

football. Sue me. However, the 
Thanksgiving episode in season 
eight taught me that randomly 
yelling at the screen is an excellent 
strategy to get out of helping with 
holiday meal preparations. I’ve also 
discovered that football breeds 
competition, and nobody does it 
better than the Gellers. Though my 
family is void of any sibling rivalry, 
Ross and Monica’s compares to that 
of Michigan and Ohio State. Season 
three’s “The One with the Foot-
ball” is infinitely better than any 
real football game I could suffer 
through, filled with pantsing and 
flashing — going so long you could 
buy a pretzel.

One thing my family excels at 

(along with the rest of America) is 
overeating. However, my Thanks-
givings are always European-ified. 
My grandma bakes cabbage pie 
instead of pumpkin and stuffing 
simply doesn’t exist in the Russian 

vocabulary. Yet again, “Friends” 
comes to the rescue with every 
Thanksgiving food delicacy I could 
dream of. Monica cooks up three 
different kinds of mashed potatoes 
in “The One with the Late Thanks-
givings” (season 10) and Joey 
demolishes an entire turkey while 
killing the fashion game in mater-
nity pants. Even watching Rachel 
screw up her trifle (which, accord-
ing to Ross, “tastes like feet”) has 
become a Thanksgiving day tradi-
tion.

The best holiday “Friends” 

episode, “The One with All the 
Thanksgivings” 
(season 
five), 

captures the universal spirit of 
the holiday: reminiscing with the 
people that have seen you at your 
best and worst. In Rachel’s words, 
“It’s Thanksgiving, and we should 
not want to be together, together.” 
“Friends” provides the heavy dose 
of nostalgia necessary for family 
gathering by reminding everyone of 
their most embarrassing moments. 
The appearance of fat Monica and 
pre-nose job Rachel will inevitably 
give you cringe-worthy flashbacks 
to high school and maybe even 
evoke some long-forgotten secrets 
to come out of hiding.

Just as the characters on screen 

change from season to season, so 
do the wonderful people that I sur-
round myself with on the holiday 
dedicated to complex carbohy-
drates and pumpkin spice every-
thing. Just last year, my younger 
cousin was covering his eyes at 
the kissing scenes. Now, he’s tak-
ing pointers from Joey and asking 
girls out on dates of his own. With-
out fail, the love that the “Friends” 
gang radiates out of the screen fills 
my own living room, making our 
yearly marathoning one of my most 
coveted traditions. We laugh, we 
cry, we try to keep the food coma 
from taking over our conscious-
ness. And through it all, we’re 
reminded that “Friends”-giving is 
truly something to be thankful for.

Following airport woes, 
‘M’ travels to N.C. State

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Anybody who has ever been 

on an airplane knows how much 
of a drag flying commercial can 
be. That’s why 
the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team typically 
charters 
flights to and 
from faraway 
destinations — 
for 
example, 

the Bahamas.

But 
the 

Wolverines’ 
supposedly 
cushy 
travel 

arrangements 
backfired in a big way on 
Saturday as they flew back from 
the Battle 4 Atlantis. Mechanical 
issues with Michigan’s charter 
flight left the team stranded 
at Nassau’s Lynden Pindling 
International 
Airport 
for 

almost 11 hours.

Such 
delays 

are never fun, 
but 
they’re 

worse 
when 

they come on 
the heels of a 
three-game, 
three-day 
tournament 
and a 5:30 a.m. 
wakeup. To rub salt in the 
wound, the Wolverines (4-2) had 
less than 48 hours to recover 
before their next long-distance 
trip — a Monday-evening flight 
to Raleigh, N.C., for Tuesday’s 
Big Ten/ACC Challenge contest 
at North Carolina State (4-2).

“We 
try 
to 
keep 
it 
in 

perspective,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach John Beilein. “To tell you 
who we are, we never heard a 
complaint one time.”

The Wolverines were lucky, 

Beilein said, that the airport had 
bench seating, which allowed 

players to catch a few hours of 
sleep. That, in turn, resulted 
in senior guard Spike Albrecht 
victimizing his dozing traveling 
companions via Instagram — he 
posted a compilation of selfies 
with sleeping teammates on 
Instagram, set to Marvin Gaye’s 
“Ain’t 
No 
Mountain 
High 

Enough,” during the delay.

Once 
Michigan 
landed, 

however, it was time to get 
serious. Saturday was supposed 
to be a day off, but given the day’s 
adventures, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

practice on Sunday ended up 
being a lighter workout than 
planned. That’s far from ideal in 
the leadup to one of Michigan’s 
final opportunities to notch a 
quality non-conference win.

“We talk about that all the 

time,” Beilein said. “You’re 
going to have to have an 
incredible Big Ten season if you 
don’t have some success against 
other high-level teams that 
you’re going to play. You have 

to win some 
of those, or 
you have to 
go be 14-4 in 
your league, 
which 
is 

really going 
to be hard to 
do.”

The 

Wolverines, 
as 
senior 

guard Caris 

LeVert noted Monday, already 
have one of those résumé-
building victories — Friday’s 
78-72 win over Texas in the 
Battle 4 Atlantis fifth-place 
game.

To pick up another, they’ll 

have to get past a team facing 
a problem opposite Michigan’s. 
While Beilein has struggled to 
whittle the Wolverines’ rotation 
to single digits in the season’s 
first six games, the Wolfpack 
have struggled with depth. 
Seven North Carolina State 
players are averaging more 

than 20 minutes per game, but 
nobody else on the roster is 
averaging more than seven.

“I see a seven-man rotation 

that is really tight right now,” 
Beilein said. “Do they have 
depth? No. But do they have 
chemistry 
and 
symmetry? 

Absolutely.”

Lack of depth was likely a 

secondary reason behind the 
Wolfpack’s 17-point home loss 
to William & Mary on opening 
night. But North Carolina State 
rebounded for an overtime win 
against No. 22 Louisiana State a 
week later, and still has plenty 
of weapons to be weary of.

In particular, the Wolverines 

will have to keep a close eye 
on junior guard Anthony “Cat” 
Barber, who is averaging 21 
points and 6.7 assists per game 
this season.

He’s 
not 
the 
only 
one. 

Beilein has spoken repeatedly 
of the way Xavier exploited 
its size advantage around the 
perimeter in its 86-70 win Nov. 
20. North Carolina State poses 
a similar threat outside the 
low post, with 6-foot-7 Caleb 
Martin, 6-foot-8 Abdul-Malik 
Abu and 6-foot-7 Maverick 
Rowan all averaging double-
digit scoring totals, collectively 
accounting for 42.2 points per 
game.

Rowan 
and 
Martin 
are 

the only two players on the 
Wolfpack roster to have made a 
3-pointer this season, meaning 
the game will likely be won 
or lost down low. The post is 
where Michigan was beaten and 
bruised the most in its losses to 
Xavier (now ranked No. 12 in 
the AP Top 25) and to then-No. 
18 Connecticut.

Then again, Michigan shot 

a combined 26-for-48 from 
3-point range in its subsequent 
wins over Charlotte and Texas. 
If that trend continues, the 
Wolverines can likely get away 
with allowing a few points in 
the paint.

Ristovski, Williams 
 

hope to be coaches

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan women’s basketball 

coach Kim Barnes Arico is 
no stranger to seeing former 
players continue their basketball 
careers after leaving her tutelage. 
Some have moved on to play 
professionally, or, like her former 
player Linda Cimino, become 
coaches themselves.

A few weeks ago, Barnes Arico 

coached against Cimino, who is 
now at the helm of Binghamton. 
Barnes Arico knew Cimino would 
become a coach years ago, saying 
that she was an outstanding 
leader and teammate in college. 

When asked if she could see 

any players on her current roster 
leading a team someday, two 
names stuck out to Barnes Arico: 
senior guard Madison Ristovski 
and 
junior 
guard 
Danielle 

Williams.

“Sometimes 
you 
have 

underdogs on your team that 
maybe aren’t the most skilled 
players, 
but 
have 
a 
great 

understanding and make people 
around them better,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Sometimes those 
are the best coaches, because 
they really understand what each 
person’s role is, and it’s not really 
just the superstar on your team.”

Ristovski 
and 
Williams 

aren’t leading scorers, but are 
important for the Wolverines’ 
success with their leadership at 
the guard positions. Both have 
invaluable experience that helps 
their teammates in practice, in 
games and in off-court situations. 
Thompson, 
a 
team 
captain, 

racked up 20 starts last season, 
while Ristovski has appeared in 
every game in her four years in 
Ann Arbor.

Both Ristovski and Williams 

hope the lessons they’ve learned 
at Michigan can bolster them 
toward a career in coaching 
basketball someday.

Basketball has always been 

important to the Ristovski family. 

Both of her sisters play basketball 
at the University of Detroit. She 
said basketball is in her blood and 
hopes to fulfill one of her dreams 
of becoming a college coach 
in the future. Her uncle, Dean 
Ristovski, was an assistant coach 
for the Titans.

“I hope after my career is over 

playing, I can continue and keep 
coaching,” Ristovski said. “I told 
(Barnes Arico) that I want to get 
my teaching certificate after this 
year, be a (graduate assistant) 
somewhere to really understand 
the coaching lifestyle as well as get 
my degree, and hopefully go from 
there.”

Williams, meanwhile, would 

also like to take the path of 
becoming a graduate assistant 
after her playing days as a 
Wolverine 
are 
through. 
She 

expressed interest in working 
with Barnes Arico and her staff at 
Michigan, admiring their passion 
and knowledge of the game.

Coaching isn’t a set-in-stone 

option for Williams, but it is 
something she has thought about 
doing before. Either way, she is 
certain basketball will be in her 
life forever.

If Williams does decide to 

become a coach, she might start 
with players younger than those 

at the collegiate level. Two of 
her coaches before she came 
to Michigan started off with 
younger kids and grew with 
them. Williams could see herself 
doing the same. The most exciting 
part of coaching for Williams is 
seeing everyone on her team and 
staff grow together.

“Just seeing teammates and 

coaches work and get better 
is so exciting,” Williams said. 
“Especially after people have put 
the time and the work in. You see 
them struggle and then you see 
them come out on the other side. 
It’s exciting for me as a player, and 
it’s exciting to see my teammates 
do that as well.”

As for her coaching philosophy, 

Williams 
would 
like 
her 

prospective team to emphasize 
defense and the fundamentals of 
shooting and passing the ball. She 
wants to keep it simple, nothing 
too flashy. Those goals don’t sound 
too different from the building 
blocks of Williams’ current coach.

Cimino is proof that Barnes 

Arico has spotted players who had 
the potential to become coaches 
and did later on. It wouldn’t be 
a surprise if she was right again 
about Ristovski and Williams.

Maybe they’ll be coaching 

against Barnes Arico someday.

Danielle Williams wants to coach after her playing career ends.

Berenson finally gets standout defensive showing

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

So far this season, the Michigan 

hockey team has consistently 
left coach Red Berenson with 
something to be desired: a stout 
defensive performance.

But this past weekend, the 

Wolverines finally gave their 
coach what he wanted.

In six periods and an overtime 

frame 
against 
Dartmouth, 

Michigan allowed only one goal 
— compared to the average of 3.1 
goals per game it was allowing 
prior to the homestand against 
the Big Green.

Even more impressive is that 

Dartmouth’s only goal came 
just as junior defenseman Zach 
Werenski left the penalty box, so 
Michigan conceded while playing 
a man down.

Granted, the Big Green aren’t 

even in the top 20 for scoring 
offense, but the performance is 
still promising for a team that was 
beginning to look eerily similar 
to the 2014 Wolverines, who fell 
short of the NCAA Tournament 
because of their own defensive 
woes.

“(Dartmouth is) not up there 

statistically like a lot of other 
schools are,” Berenson said. “So 
we have to take that with a grain 
of salt. But any time you give up 
one goal-against on the weekend, 
that’s pretty good.”

Added 
Werenski: 
“Our 

goaltending 
played 
extremely 

well. For (Nagelvoort) to come 
in after (Racine) got hurt on 
Saturday and do the job he did 
— it was definitely a confidence-
booster for probably him and our 
whole team.”

Now that Michigan is back in 

the swing of things — and given 
that the freshmen defensemen 
have adjusted well to the college 
level 
— 
Berenson 
is 
trying 

different 
defensive 
pairs 
in 

practice.

Depending 
on 
how 
the 

experiments go this week, the 
Wolverines may give Wisconsin 
a different look in the defensive 
zone Friday.

BRING ON THE BIG TEN: 

The Michigan hockey team has 
had 11 games to prepare for its 
Big Ten season opener, and the 
enthusiasm for the conference 
schedule has grown with each of 
those contests.

“The Big Ten is fun,” Werenski 

said. “It’s nice to start conference 
play knowing that every game 
means something. I know they all 
mean something for Pairwise and 
your ranking and stuff like that, 
but going into your conference 
and playing Wisconsin for the 

first weekend, it’s huge to get off 
to a good start.”

The state of the Big Ten is 

unimpressive as conference play 
begins, as just Michigan and Penn 
State boast winning records, but 
Berenson is confident that the 
Wolverines’ opponents’ records 
are far from representative of 
their ability.

“Minnesota is better than 

their record,” Berenson said. 
“Wisconsin is better than their 
record. Michigan State is a pretty 
doggone good team. They’re 
much better than they were last 
year, that’s the word anyway. And 
Ohio State usually starts slow. 
That’s why you have the games. 
Now everyone’s getting pumped 

up for the Big Ten, and this will 
start sorting everybody out.”

PRAISING 
PIAZZA: 

Sophomore defenseman Cutler 
Martin was scratched from the 
lineup Saturday night, but not for 
health-related reasons.

Instead, 
sophomore 

defenseman Sam Piazza has 
been impressing the coaching 
staff in practice as of late. With 
the Big Ten season on the 
horizon, Berenson felt the need 
to give the sophomore blueliner 
more experience so that he felt 
comfortable integrating him into 
the seven-man rotation.

“Sam is one of our healthy 

defensemen right now — we’ve 
got seven healthy defensemen,” 

Berenson said. “He probably 
hasn’t had a chance to play as 
much as some 
other guys, but 
he’s right there. 
I thought he 
held his own 
on 
Saturday, 

and 
whether 

we play him 
or 
not 
this 

weekend, 
we 

know 
he’s 

ready to play and help our team.”

Piazza was efficient when 

given his opportunity Saturday, 
effectively moving the puck out of 
the defensive zone — something 
that earned the praise of fellow 
defenseman Zach Werenski.

“The first thing I noticed on 

Saturday night was (that) his 
passes to the forwards were 
on the tape,” Werenski said. 
“That’s what you want out of a 
defenseman, is just to get the 
puck up to the forwards and get it 
in their hands. It’s always a bonus 
when you can make the little 
seam plays like (Piazza) makes.”

INJURY UPDATE: Fourteen 

minutes into the first period 
Saturday, senior goaltender Steve 
Racine suffered a lower-body 
injury after saving Darmouth 
forward Tim O’Brien’s shot. The 
veteran netminder fell to the ice 
before being helped to the locker 
room. 

Racine didn’t return against 

the 
Big 
Green 
and 
didn’t 

participate in practice Monday.

Berenson labeled the recovery 

process 
as 
a 
week-to-week 

evaluation and said he had no 
expectation that Racine would 
take the ice at all this week.

The Wolverines are facing 

other injuries on the defensive 
end as well.

Though Berenson originally 

expected 
junior 
defenseman 

Kevin Lohan to be available 
for the matchup with Boston 
University, the blueliner couldn’t 
suit up against the Terriers due to 
a lower-body injury.

“When 

(Lohan) started 
skating 
and 

practicing, 
there 
was 

a 
setback,” 

Berenson said. 
“So now we’ve 
taken him off 
the 
ice, 
and 

we’re 
going 

to let it hopefully heal and get 
better.”

Lohan is expected to start light 

skating on Thursday or Friday of 
this week, but it’s unlikely that 
he will make a full return before 
Christmas.

Peppers, Lewis make All-Big Ten team

Other Wolverines 
also earned second- 

and third-team 

honors

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team’s 

defense succeeded for most of 
the year with strong play from 
all three units. But on Monday, 
when the Big Ten announced its 

all-conference defensive teams, 
the secondary led the way.

Junior cornerback Jourdan 

Lewis and redshirt freshman 
safety Jabrill Peppers were the 
Wolverines’ representatives on 
the All-Big Ten team. Peppers 
also earned the Thompson-
Randle El Freshman of the 
Year award. The Big Ten will 
announce 
its 
all-conference 

offensive teams Tuesday night.

Along with senior safety 

Jarrod Wilson, redshirt junior 
cornerback Jeremy Clark and 
the help of other players off 

the bench, Lewis and Peppers 
led one of the best defensive 
backfields in the country. The 
Wolverines ranked third in the 
nation with 158.8 passing yards 
allowed per game, trailing only 
Georgia and San Jose State. 
Four times, they gave up fewer 
than 100 in a game.

Lewis 
broke 
a 
Michigan 

single-season record with 19 
pass breakups. He added two 
interceptions, one of which 
he returned for a touchdown 
against 
Northwestern. 
The 

Detroit native also finished 

fourth on the team with 46 
tackles.

Peppers, meanwhile, made 

an impact all over the field. 
He spent most of his time on 
defense, where he broke up 10 
passes and added 45 tackles (5.5 
for loss). He also averaged 11.4 
yards on 17 punt returns and 
27.9 yards on eight kick returns, 
breaking several big plays and 
narrowly missing touchdowns 
several times.

Finally, on Oct. 17 against 

Michigan State, the Wolverines 
tried to mix Peppers in on 
offense, mostly with success. 
He finished with 18 carries for 
72 yards and two touchdowns, 
as well as eight receptions for 79 
yards. His presence in all three 
phases of the game allowed 
him to finish fifth on the team 
in all-purpose yardage, despite 
playing mostly defense.

Peppers is in good company 

among 
Michigan’s 
other 

Freshmen of the Year: Charles 
Woodson 
in 
1995, 
Anthony 

Thomas in 1997, Steve Breaston 
in 2003 and Mike Hart in 2004.

The Wolverines also placed 

members on the second and third 
teams. Redshirt junior defensive 
lineman Chris Wormley (third 
team, coaches), Peppers (second-
team return specialist, coaches) 
and senior kicker Kenny Allen 
(third team, media) were all 
recognized. 
Fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock was 
Michigan’s 
sportsmanship 

honoree. All in all, the Wolverines 
had a much stronger presence on 
the end-of-season awards list 
than in recent years.

No other team had two 

players selected to both the 
media and the coaches’ first 
teams. Ohio State featured four 
players on at least one team: 
linebacker Raekwon McMillan 

(media), Joshua Perry (coaches), 
safety Vonn Bell (media) and 
defensive end Joey Bosa, a 
member of both.

Bosa was the conference’s 

Defensive 
Lineman 
of 
the 

Year, joining Michigan State’s 
Shilique 
Calhoun, 
Penn 

State’s Carl Nassib — the Big 
Ten’s Defensive Player of the 
Year, despite not winning the 
defensive lineman award — and 
Maryland’s Yannick Ngakoue on 
the first team.

The 
linebackers 
were 

Wisconsin’s 
Joe 
Schobert 

(the Linebacker of the Year), 
Northwestern’s 
Anthony 

Walker and a split between 
McMillan and Perry.

Iowa’s Desmond King won 

the Defensive Back of the Year 
award. Bell and Maryland’s Will 
Likely, the coaches’ selection, 
shared the last spot on the first 
team.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis had 19 pass breakups this season on his way to being named to the All-Big Ten team.
