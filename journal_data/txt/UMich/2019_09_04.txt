The 
Graduate 
Employee 
Organization published a petition 
last 
month 
requesting 
more 
information about a recently 
approved University of Michigan 
fee 
for 
most 
international 
students. The additional expense 
was created to bolster support 
services 
for 
international 
students at the University. 
The 
petition, 
which 
was 
published on Change.org three 
weeks ago, has amassed more 

than 380 signatures as of press 
time.
GEO decided to create the 
petition to stand up for all 
University students who will face 
additional obstacles in their path 
to degree completion because of 
the fee, said Rackham student 
Allan Martell, co-chair of GEO’s 
International Students’ Caucus.
The fee doesn’t actually apply 
to all graduate students — for 
example, Ph.D. students currently 
have the fee waived. But GEO 
decided to create the petition 
to stand up for all University 

students who will face additional 
obstacles in their path to degree 
completion because of the fee, said 
Rackham student Allan Martell, 
co-chair of GEO’s International 
Students’ Caucus.
“I 
know 
many 
other 
international students who are 
masters and (undergraduates),” 
Martell said. “They, for the most 
part, are not covered under GEO — 
there is only a handful of students 
who are. Even if most members 
of our association wouldn’t be 
affected, we are acting out of 
solidarity and recognition that 

this is going to affect people other 
than ourselves and people who 
are making a lot of sacrifices so 
that they can find their studies 
here at Michigan.”
In the petition, GEO argued the 
fee contradicts the goals of the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan on campus. GEO wrote the 
fee not only creates additional 
financial burden but adds to the 
issues 
international 
students 
already 
face 
with 
national 
immigration policies and political 
discourse.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Central 
Student 
Government discussed several 
upcoming 
executive 
projects 
including game day hydration 
stations as well as plans to address 
the change in University policy 
regarding coverage for sexually 
transmitted diseases during its 
first assembly of the school year 
Tuesday night.
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
meeting, Isabelle Blanchard, CSG 

vice president and LSA senior, 
discussed the success of the first 
game day this previous Saturday 
with the creation of several 
hydration 
stations. 
Hydration 
stations located across campus 
provided water and food to 
ensure student safety. MDining, 
Center for Campus Involvement 
and Fraternity and Sorority Life 
donated hot dogs and water for 
the stations. Blanchard said CSG 
hopes to make these stations 
more sustainable this year by 
including compostable cups at 

water refill stations rather than 
distributing disposable plastic 
water bottles.
“This year we are trying 
to make them a little more 
sustainable,” Blanchard said. “we 
tried doing compostable cups 
instead of plastic water bottles, 
and that is a model we are trying 
to figure out how to do at other 
stations.”
Both 
Ben 
Gerstein, 
CSG 
president and Public Policy junior, 
and Blanchard addressed the 
recent changes to the University 

Health 
Service 
insurance, 
specifically with regard to the 
elimination 
of 
coverage 
for 
sexually transmitted infection 
screening. 
They 
expressed 
concern regarding the issue and 
the student response. 
“The 
change 
did 
happen 
in July, but there is a lot more 
traction on it now, and so we have 
been preparing for this already, 
starting by making a survey to 
gain feedback on this,” Blanchard 
said. 

Approximately 
280 
faculty 
parking spaces were converted 
to patient-only parking near the 
University of Michigan hospital 
in mid-August. The changes force 
many hospital staff members to 
park in off-site locations or find 
other methods of transportation.
The 
parking 
designation 
transfer is necessary for an 
improved 
patient 
experience, 
according to a statement from 
Beata 
Mostafavi, 
Michigan 
Medicine senior communications 
representative. 
“As 
Michigan 
Medicine 
continues to grow, parking around 
the main medical campus has 
become an increasing challenge 
for both patients and employees,” 
Mostafavi 
said. 
“The 
recent 
parking changes provided 280 
more spaces for our patients to 
make it easier to obtain care at the 
hospital.”
But according to Robin Carter, 
executive director of the House 
Officers Association at Michigan 
Medicine, the actions go against 
the HOA’s agreement with the 
University of Michigan Health 
System, 
which 
requires 
the 
hospital to provide designated 
parking spots to on-call employees.

City calls out 
U-M for lack 
of help with 
housing issue

As ‘U’ looks to improve facilities, 
Council questions A2 affordability

Standing 
in 
Theatre 
Nova 
on Saturday night, Ann Arbor 
Community High School teacher 
Quinn Strassel welcomed dozens 
of audience members to a staged 
reading of the musical he spent 
the summer crafting. His subject: 
U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy 
DeVos, whom he dubs “the most 
controversial woman in the world” 
in the opening number. 
Strassel 
wrote 
and 
directed 
“Betsy 
DeVos! 
The 
Musical!” 
over the summer. DeVos — a 
prominent Republican donor and 
an advocate of charter schools — is 
heavily caricatured in the play and 
portrayed as a die-hard antagonist of 
public schools. 
Strassel said he uses humor to 
tackle complicated topics, adding 
that he hopes the show demonstrates 
the importance of public education 
as well as critically talking about 
proposals DeVos has put forward.
“I hope it starts a new conversation 
about public schools,” Strassel said. 
“I think sometimes humor can help 
tackle complex and difficult issues 
in public schools. I think public 
school policy is complicated, and 
people of every political persuasion, 
have difficulty making sense of it 
— and DeVos advocated for guns in 
schools.”

University 
representatives 
faced 
criticism 
from 
city 
councilmembers Monday night 
for what elected officials called its 
lack of involvement in combating 
Ann Arbor’s affordable housing 
shortage. 
The City Council meeting 
began with a presentation of 
infrastructure 
improvement 
plans by University Campus 
Planner Susan Gott and Director 
of Community Relations Michael 
Rein. The University’s newest 
plans are centered on enhancing 
campus life with an emphasis on 
sustainability. A large portion 
of the presentation focused on 
renovating University housing, 
including Mary Markley Hall 
and the Northwood IV & V 
apartments.
At the conclusion of the 
presentation, 
Jeff 
Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, asked if the University 
would consider aiding the crisis 
by building affordable housing in 

Ann Arbor.
“Is there any appetite for 
the 
University 
considering 
building additional housing for 
staff, students and faculty to 
take pressure off the housing 
market in the city?” Hayner 
said. “Because we know we 
have an affordability crisis, and 
a lot of that is demand — just 
basic demand for housing — and 
the open market isn’t able to 
supply it in a quality way that the 
University can.”
Rein said while the University 
creates initiatives to bring the 
Ann Arbor community and 
University together, the school 
does not want to compete against 
the marketplace and, except for 
student housing, building living 
spaces are “just not the mission 
of the University.”
This 
comment 
sparked 
pushback from several members 
urging that affordable housing 
should also be a University issue.

LSA senior Kathy Zhu, the 
vic LSA senior Kathy Zhu, the 
vice chair of the University of 
Michigan College Republicans, 
made national headlines after 
Miss World America stripped her 
of her Miss Michigan title in July. 
The action was in response to two 
tweets from her public Twitter 
account. According to an email 
the organization sent to Zhu, the 
tweets were deemed “offensive, 
insensitive 
and 
inappropriate 
content.” 
As a new school year begins, 
students have mixed ideas on 
how her comments will affect the 
campus climate at U-M. 
One of the tweets, posted 
in February 2018, responded 
to a “try on a hijab” booth in 
celebration of World Hijab Day at 
the University of Central Florida, 

where Zhu used to attend school. 
Zhu’s tweet equated the use of a 
hijab to the oppression of women 
under Islam. Zhu transferred to 
the University of Michigan the 
following semester of Fall 2018 
after receiving backlash for the 
tweet from thousands of Twitter 
users and UCF students, some of 
which called for her expulsion.
The other tweet brought into 
question by MWA was posted in 
October 2017, and blamed Black 
Americans for violence within 
their own communities. Both 
tweets have since been deleted 
from Zhu’s account, although she 
told Fox News in July she does not 
rescind any of her statements. 
“I stand by all of the tweets that 
I tweeted out from my Twitter 
account, but I don’t think that 
any of them were remotely racist 
or insensitive,” Zhu said in her 
interview with Fox News. “I just 
think I presented the facts and 

presented my own opinion of 
things.”
Zhu did not respond to requests 
for comment from The Michigan 
Daily.
Less than a week after the 
incident, Zhu was named to the 
Women for Trump Coalition 
Advisory Board. More recently, 
founders of a new beauty pageant 
titled Miss MAGA said Zhu’s 
story inspired them to create the 
competition.
LSA senior Maria Muzaurieta 
said College Republicans “fully 
stands behind” Zhu in an email to 
The Daily back in July.
“Although (MWA is) within 
their rights to do this as a private 
organization, we believe that 
this decision shows incredible 
bias 
against 
unextraordinary 
right wing opinion, which we 
expect will come back to hurt the 
organization,” Muzaurieta wrote.
Since her initial comment in 
July, Muzaurieta has not 
responded 
to 
additional 
requests for comment from 
The Daily.
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Camille 
Mancuso, 
communications 
director 
for the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, wrote 
in an email to The Daily 
in July that the College 
Democrats condemn Zhu’s 
statements and regard them 
as “racist.” 
Now, with the start of a 
new school year, Mancuso 
said Zhu’s comments are 
still 
very 
important 
to 
discuss.
“Unfortunately, 
the 
incident regarding Kathy 
Zhu and her comments 
is not unique,” Mancuso 
wrote in a recent email. 
“Whether it’s in the form of 
racist graffiti in residence 
halls, Ben Shapiro speaking 
on campus, Stephen Ross 
fundraising for Trump or 
the words of Kathy Zhu, the 
racism on this campus is 
unfortunately very present 
and very persistent and 

very reflective of the systemic 
racism that is existent not only 
in Michigan and on Michigan’s 
campus but across the nation.”
Zhu’s actions will diminish 
the 
mental 
well-being 
of 
the 
student 
population, 
and 
specifically students of color on 
campus, Manusco said. She said 
student activists like the College 
Democrats will continue to fight 
for equity and inclusion within 
the University and surrounding 
community. 
“Racism is not welcome on our 
campus, and we will do the work 
as an organization to combat this 
continued 
harmful 
rhetoric,” 
Mancuso wrote to The Daily.
LSA junior Fareah Fysudeen, 
vice president external of the 
Muslim 
Student 
Association, 
received 
infuriated, 
deeply 
saddened 
and 
disappointed 
reaction messages in an MSA 
group chat when Zhu’s comments 
first became public, she told The 
Daily in an email interview.
“As 
an 
active 
community 
member 
in 
the 
Muslim 
community on campus, I believe 
every Islamaphobic remark, no 
matter how little, chips away at 
our general feeling of safety and 
belonging,” Fysudeen wrote. 
However, LSA junior Thomas 
Vance, an Afroamerican and 
African 
studies 
and 
political 
science double major, said he 
believes the campus political 
climate is constantly shifting and 
a significant change will not occur 
solely as a result of Zhu’s actions.
“I don’t think it’s in the 
forefront of anyone’s mind,” Vance 
said. “Because it was over the 
summer, people have internships, 
take classes, but I don’t think 
anyone’s been thinking about it. 
The conversations I’ve had within 
my friend group or the circle that 
I’m in, they haven’t really brought 
it up. It was something that 
happened, and we thought about it 
for a few days.”

Hurricane Katrina’s effects felt at ‘U,’ school takes 
in displaced students from the storm-stricken coast

September 6, 2005
In response to the devastation 
left by Hurricane Katrina, the 
University has begun admitting 
displaced college students from 
disaster-stricken 
universities 
while continuing to locate missing 
University students from areas hit 
by the hurricane.
Sue Eklund, the University dean 
of students, said yesterday that of 
the 86 current University students 
who are from the disaster-affected 
areas - Alabama, Mississippi and 
Louisiana - her office has yet to 
hear back from 32 students.

“We have not heard of our 
students being seriously injured or 
worse, though it’s important to note 
that some do have missing relatives, 
more have missing friends,” she 
said.
Eklund added that her office is 
using e-mail to contact the missing 
students and offering to pay for 
plane tickets for student who could 
not access their bank accounts. She 
said the Office of Financial Aid 
has also been assisting students 
financially
affected by the disaster on an 
individual basis.

While 
the 
University 
does 
not know the whereabouts of 32 
students, Eklund said many of those 
students may have ignored her 
office’s e-mails or will only begin 
checking their University e-mail 
accounts once school has started. 
With some colleges effectively shut 
down from the flooding, University 
officials said their offices have been 
inundated with inquires
from displaced students hoping 
to attend the University.
Ted 
Spencer, 
director 
of 
undergraduate admissions, said on 
Friday

that his office has received about 
50 inquiries, 31 of which were from
Tulane 
University 
students. 
Tulane, a college of about 8,000 
undergraduate students located 
in New Orleans, canceled its fall 
semester on Friday.
The Office of Undergraduate 
Admissions has so far admitted 12 
as nondegree students, Spencer 
said, adding that the office does 
not plan to limit the number of 
displaced students who wish to 
attend the University.
“We are taking this one on a 
case-by-case basis,” Spencer said. 

“There
is no number associated with 
this. Our primary concern is to help 
the students in the area attending 
a university by helping them 
continue
their education.”
He 
also 
noted 
that 
the 
admissions office has in some cases 
abided by an “honor system” for 
displaced students that have never, 
applied to the University and as a 
result undergraduate admissions 
does not have their
transcript information on hand. 
But Spencer said his office does 

not anticipate any future problems 
because the students who have 
been
admitted either applied to or 
were accepted by the University 
but chose to attend a different 
college. Spencer said he expects the 
inquiries to cease by Sept. 9, when 
fall semester is underway.
The University’s law school 
also announced on Friday it would 
begin accepting displaced students, 
with priority given to third-year 
law students and to students with 
connections to the state or the 
University.

“We 
have 
a 
collective 
bargaining agreement,” Carter 
said. “We have specific language 
where the employer is supposed to 
provide parking for residents that 
are designated for being on-call. 
There is obviously no designated 
parking.”
As a result of these changes, 
the Michigan Nurses Association 
and 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Professional Nurse Council filed 
unfair labor practice charges with 
the state of Michigan in August, 
according to Carter.
Carter said the changes force 
hospital staff to pay significantly 
more money for their parking 
spots. 
“People who have been parking 
for, for example, $100 a year for 
maybe decades are now being 
charged maybe $700 or $800 a year 
for the same parking spot,” Carter 
said. “We agree that there needs 
to be parking for patients. We’re 
not arguing that, but we believe 
administrators who do not have 
any involvement with patient care 
do not need to be parking close to 
the building. It’s been an ongoing 
problem for a very long time, and 
now we’re in a crisis situation.”

According to UMPNC chair 
Katie Oppenheim, parking at 
the hospital has been an ongoing 
challenge.
“Parking has been an issue at the 
hospital for decades,” Oppenheim 
said. “While the health system 
has grown — multiplied many 
times over in the previous years 
— the parking has not increased. 
For example, when they built the 
children’s hospital, they did not put 
parking underneath the building.”
Oppenheim 
said 
parking 
difficulties 
add 
an 
increased 
amount of stress to hospital 
staff, particularly nurses, before 
the start of their shifts, and can 
ultimately decrease quality of care.
“You want people who aren’t 
stressed and are relaxed when they 
come into work for their shift,” 
Oppenheim said. “Our first goal, 
and everyone’s first goal, should 
be the patients, and providing 
what we believe is something 
mandatory, mainly, access to the 
workplace. ”
Jayne 
Hubscher, 
Nursing 
senior 
and 
president 
of 
the 
Student Nurses’ Association, said 
she and other nursing students 
often walk or find other modes of 
transportation to the hospital as a 
result of the parking challenges.
Hubscher said a lack of reliable 
parking is a major concern when 

clinical trials occur early in the 
morning or late at night.
“Our clinicals, a lot of times, will 
start at 6 or 6:30 a.m. so if you live 
far from the hospital you have to 
wake up even earlier, like 4:30 or 5 
(a.m.) to have time to get ready and 
walk to the hospital,” Hubscher 
said. “Sometimes we have late 
clinicals, too, that end around 11 
p.m. I had one last semester and 
then walking home was always an 
issue as well.”
Mostafavi said many other 
forms 
of 
transportation 
are 
available and will continue to be 
implemented with the creation of 
a new parking deck next year and 
960 new employee parking spots. 
Carter said she hopes to have 
clear dialogue in the future with 
Michigan Medicine to help remedy 
the issues.
“I would say that the Michigan 
Medicine leadership needs to 
understand that since I’ve been 
here, we’ve gone from having 900 
residents and fellows to nearly 
1,300, and we have not built any 
adjacent parking structures to 
the hospital,” Carter said. “That 
being said, how do you realign the 
parking structures we have for 
those clinicians that need to be 
at the bedside? We would love to 
have a dialogue and do some real 
problem solving.”

Additionally, the petition said 
University administrators have 
attributed the fee to sustaining and 
enhancing services to support the 
success of international students 
and compliance and reporting 
requirements, 
though 
they 
question the University’s ability to 
do this without a detailed plan for 
the use of the money.
The $500 per semester fee was 
approved by the Board of Regents 
on June 20 and took effect in the 
fall semester. The fee applies to 
students on F-1 and J-1 visas, which 
are for international students 
studying in the United States, 
and was created to fund support 
services for students attending the 
University on these specific visas.
A 2018 report from the University’s 
International Center listed 6,628 
students on the F-1 visa and 115 
students or the J-1 visa. International 
students accounted for 14.9 percent 
of the student body in 2018.
The fee, which is similar to 
others that support programs like 
the University Health Service and 
Student Legal Services, aligns the 
University with other institutions 
like Michigan State University that 
have a fee or tuition differential for 
international students, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald wrote 
in an email to The Daily. 
According 
to 
Fitzgerald, 
because the fee will support 
services related to creating a 
welcoming campus environment 
and supporting academic success, 
it does not contradict the goals of 
DEI initiatives on campus.
“(T)he University places a high 
priority on providing supportive 
services and infrastructure that 
promote a sense of welcome 
and integration into the campus 
community and that promote 
academic 
success,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. “This fee will help the 
University 
to 
maintain 
and 
enhance 
its 
commitment 
to 
international 
student 
services, 
programming 
and 
compliance, 
and we see no conflict with the 
University’s commitment to DEI.”
Additionally, 
the 
University 
has hosted, and will continue 
to host, immigration advising, 
cultural exchange activities and 
workshops 
and 
panels 
about 
topics such as navigating the U.S. 
job market, Fitzgerald wrote. He 
noted these experiences often 
come out of conversations between 
University staff members and the 
international students themselves.
He explained deciding on specific 
details of the implementation of the 
revenue created by the fee, though 
the University has and continues 
to 
welcome 
community 
input. 
Fitzgerald encouraged those with 
questions or input to consult the 
Frequently Asked Questions page or 
contact the University by emailing 
internationalstudentfees@umich.edu.
“It will take some time to 
determine the ways in which the 
funding generated by the fee will 
be utilized,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“Many in our community have 
communicated directly with the 
Provost’s 
Office 
and 
through 
the 
International 
Center 
the 
need for additional services and 
programming, and we want to 
be thoughtful and listen to these 
groups as we make allocation 
decisions.”
According to the Department 

of Homeland Security, students on 
F-1 visas come to the United States 
to enroll in a full-time program of 
study a certified school. Students on 
this visa have a designated official 
at their school who is responsible 
for helping them through the 
“international student lifecycle,” a 
pathway for international students 
to study in the U.S. and maintain 
their visa.
While F-1 visa holders can be 
a student at any point in their 
academic career, J-1 visa holders 
must enroll in a full-time post-
secondary program at an academic 
institution. The J-1 College and 
University Student Program allows 
participants to have career-related 
training as an intern in their home 
country. 
Additionally, 
students 
on the J-1 visa have a cultural 
component of their program to 
engage them with the U.S. culture 
and share their home culture with 
their host families.
With 
Chinese 
students 
accounting for approximately half 
of the University’s international 
student population, Jiaheng He, 
LSA junior and co-president of the 
Chinese Students and Scholars 
Association, said his organization 
felt a need to speak out against 
the fee. The Chinese Students 
and 
Scholars 
Association 
has 
joined GEO in requesting more 
information about the fee and what 
the money will go toward.
“What we really hope for the 
school to do is to give us more 
information and tell us what 
they’re going to use the money for,” 
He said. 
He said he hopes the money will 
be put directly into improving the 
lives of international students on 
campus, such as through offering 
more scholarships or additional 
opportunities. He is concerned this 
will create a dangerous precedent, 
as the fee could increase or another 
group could be singled out similarly 
in the future.
Martell said GEO is requesting 
a town hall with University 
Provost Martin Philbert to gain 
more insight in relation to the fee, 
though the organization’s previous 
communications with the Provost’s 
office have gone unheard. GEO 
members attended a meeting with 
LSA leadership, though they left 
that meeting with more questions 
than answers, he said.
“We really have no information 
that makes a compelling case for 
the necessity of the fee,” Martell 
said. “We see no reason for it. We 
just think that it will be better to 
get rid of it all together, but we also 
acknowledge that we may not have 
all the facts.”
Approximately 
280 
faculty 
parking spaces were converted 
to patient-only parking near the 
University of Michigan hospital 
in mid-August. The changes force 
many hospital staff members to 
park in off-site locations or find 
other methods of transportation.
The 
parking 
designation 
transfer 
is 
necessary 
for 
an 
improved 
patient 
experience, 
according to a statement from 
Beata 
Mostafavi, 
Michigan 
Medicine senior communications 
representative. 
“As 
Michigan 
Medicine 
continues to grow, parking around 
the main medical campus has 
become an increasing challenge 
for both patients and employees,” 
Mostafavi 
said. 
“The 
recent 
parking changes provided 280 
more spaces for our patients to 

make it easier to obtain care at the 
hospital.”
But according to Robin Carter, 
executive director of the House 
Officers Association at Michigan 
Medicine, the actions go against 
the HOA’s agreement with the 
University of Michigan Health 
System, 
which 
requires 
the 
hospital to provide designated 
parking spots to on-call employees.
“We 
have 
a 
collective 
bargaining 
agreement,” 
Carter 
said. “We have specific language 
where the employer is supposed to 
provide parking for residents that 
are designated for being on-call. 
There is obviously no designated 
parking.”
As a result of these changes, 
the Michigan Nurses Association 
and 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Professional Nurse Council filed 
unfair labor practice charges with 
the state of Michigan in August, 
according to Carter.
Carter said the changes force 
hospital staff to pay significantly 
more money for their parking 
spots. 
“People who have been parking 
for, for example, $100 a year for 
maybe decades are now being 
charged maybe $700 or $800 a year 
for the same parking spot,” Carter 
said. “We agree that there needs 
to be parking for patients. We’re 
not arguing that, but we believe 
administrators who do not have 
any involvement with patient care 
do not need to be parking close to 
the building. It’s been an ongoing 
problem for a very long time, and 
now we’re in a crisis situation.”
According to UMPNC chair 
Katie Oppenheim, parking at 
the hospital has been an ongoing 
challenge.
“Parking has been an issue at the 
hospital for decades,” Oppenheim 
said. “While the health system 
has grown — multiplied many 
times over in the previous years 
— the parking has not increased. 
For example, when they built the 
children’s hospital, they did not put 
parking underneath the building.”
Oppenheim 
said 
parking 
difficulties 
add 
an 
increased 
amount of stress to hospital staff, 
particularly nurses, before the start 
of their shifts, and can ultimately 
decrease quality of care.
“You want people who aren’t 
stressed and are relaxed when they 
come into work for their shift,” 
Oppenheim said. “Our first goal, 
and everyone’s first goal, should be 
the patients, and providing what 
we believe is something mandatory, 
mainly, access to the workplace. ”
Jayne 
Hubscher, 
Nursing 
senior 
and 
president 
of 
the 
Student Nurses’ Association, said 
she and other nursing students 
often walk or find other modes of 
transportation to the hospital as a 
result of the parking challenges.
Hubscher said a lack of reliable 
parking is a major concern when 
clinical trials occur early in the 
morning or late at night.
“Our clinicals, a lot of times, will 
start at 6 or 6:30 a.m. so if you live 
far from the hospital you have to 
wake up even earlier, like 4:30 or 5 
(a.m.) to have time to get ready and 
walk to the hospital,” Hubscher 
said. “Sometimes we have late 
clinicals, too, that end around 11 
p.m. I had one last semester and 
then walking home was always an 
issue as well.”

Ann Arbor City Council decided 
by a one-vote margin against 
re-nominating 
Councilmember 
Zachary Ackerman, D-Ward 3, 
to the Planning Commission and 
voted unanimously to release 
a redacted report on the city’s 
investigation 
into 
a 
former 
employee’s controversial texts at 
their meeting Tuesday night.
When confirming nominations 
for the Planning Commission, 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
re-nominated 
Ackerman, 
who 
has served on the Planning 
Commission since December 2016. 
Councilmembers 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, gave a speech 
detailing the time and effort that 
Ackerman offered in his time on 
the commission. Grand said she 
appreciated the intellect Ackerman 
brought to his responsibilities and 
noted that the authority to appoint 
members belonged to the mayor, 
not other members of council such 
as Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, who voted to block 
Ackerman’s nomination. Eaton 
previously challenged Taylor for 
the mayor’s office, but lost in the 
primary in 2018.
“I won’t be soft and squishy 
about it — I’ll call it like I see 
it,” Grand said. “In the past we 
have all supported one another’s 

nominations to serve on boards 
and commissions. That has been 
our past practice, try to spread it 
around in a way that’s equitable, 
but ultimately the appointments 
to boards and commissions in 
almost every case, and certainly 
in this one, rests with the mayor. 
If Councilmember Eaton wanted 
to appoint himself to the Planning 
Commission, he should have won 
the mayoral race. But he did not, 
and now it’s Mayor Taylor’s job to 
appoint someone to the Planning 
Commission.” 
Councilmember 
Elizabeth 
Nelson, D-Ward 4, pushed back, 
saying that it was not about politics 
and civility, but about the need to 
have someone more experienced 
on the commission.
“I think it is time we had 
someone on planning who has a 
stronger legal background,” Nelson 
said. “We can move forward with a 
decision, and it’s not about anybody 
being mean to anyone. It’s not about 
a lack of respect. It’s about making 
a different choice, and those are the 
reasons why I support someone 
else 
on 
planning, 
specifically 
Councilmember Eaton.”
Ackerman said his position on the 
Planning Commission was not easy.
“The body meets frequently 
and deals with subjects that are 
the most controversial by their 
very nature,” Ackerman said. “I’ve 
had a philosophy as a planning 

commissioner: My obligation to 
council is to get the best proposal 
through planning proposal to this 
body. It may not be one worthy 
of voting ‘yes’ when it comes to 
council, but that job is to deliver 
to you the best possible version 
leaving planning commission so 
that you can make a decision.”
The council voted 6-5 against 
re-nominating Ackerman to the 
planning commission. 
City Council also addressed 
an investigation conducted by 
outside attorney Sheldon Stark 
into controversial texts sent by 
the city’s human resources and 
labor relations director, Robyn 
Wilkerson. Wilkerson resigned in 
May after public records requests 
filed by the Ann Arbor News/
MLive revealed a cache of text 
messages she sent to another 
city employee criticizing elected 
officials and “crazy liberals.”
The messages also mentioned 
wanting to blow up City Hall, 
wanting to bring a gun to work and 
racist comments targeted at other 
coworkers and the community.
The 
city 
attorney’s 
office 
hired Stark to investigate the 
city’s handling of the original 
investigation. Sheldon concluded 
his inquiry in late August but the 
findings were not released publicly.

Ackerman’s nomination

Councilmember loses spot on Planning Commission

“I think, at this point, the 
administration is aware of this, but 
I think they need to hear from more 
students that this really is an issue 
for us.”
Blanchard said CSG will be 
sending out a survey in order to 
gauge student feedback on the 
UHS policy change. She said she 
hopes the survey will ensure 
the 
administration 
more 
fully 
understands students’ reactions to 
the change. Within this survey, the 
policy changes will be described 
and broken down so the complex 
insurance 
issue 
can 
be 
more 
transparent and easily understood. 
The 
survey 
will 
also 
provide 
information about local alternatives 
for STI testing.
“In our survey, we do a really 
great job explaining what the 
changes are,” Blanchard said. “I 
think it can get really confusing, 
and health care, in general, can 
be a really complicated issue; we 
explain it, and we are also providing 
alternative STI resources in the 
area.”
During the meeting Gerstein 
reviewed the work the executive 
branch had completed over the 
summer, including plans to subsidize 
Group X passes, which would 
allow students to go through the 
University financial aid department 
to receive passes to participate in 

group fitness classes provided by 
University Recreational Sports. 
Additionally, CSG will begin 
preparing for the effects of the 
2020 
presidential 
elections 
on 
campus life by collaborating with 
Intergroup Relations, Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs and the Trotter 
Multicultural Center to ensure 
campus climate remains safe and 
inclusive.
“We are looking to figure out 
how we make sure student leaders 
are most respective when it comes 
to conversations (regarding the 
election) within their organizations 
and throughout campus throughout 
the next year,” Gerstein said.
Gerstein also hopes to create a 
new executive position to oversee 
government relations. This position 
will focus on ensuring the voices of 
University students are heard on 
a state and federal governmental 
level.
“The reason we are having that 
(position) is to try and create and 
find new ways to make sure our 
student body is heard at the state 
level and at the federal level,” 
Gerstein said. “It’s important we 
make sure our voices are heard, 
especially regarding federal issues 
that impact the students.”
Other 
summer 
projects 
included creating a tri-fold CSG 
flyer to help students better 
understand the functions of CSG 
and thus know how to utilize the 
Assembly more effectively. Their 
goal is to reach out to students and 

build a stronger connection with 
the constituency.
CSG also created reusable grocery 
bags for Beyond the Diag, increased 
student tutoring resources and 
expanded North Campus resources. 
With construction beginning on 
North Campus, Blanchard said CSG 
hopes to make decisions on ways to 
improve North Campus health and 
wellness services.
Taylor Lansey, CSG treasurer and 
LSA junior, discussed this year’s 
plan for the Student Organization 
Funding Committee on behalf of 
the chair, Business senior Crede 
Strauser. Lansey said funding will 
be distributed via nine application 
waves 
throughout 
the 
school 
year, the first of which will open 
Wednesday, Sept. 4 night at 5 p.m. 
and close at the same time next 
Wednesday, Sept. 11. 
SOFC projections for this fall 
include an aggregated request for 
$600,000, a 22.6 percent increase 
from last fall, as well as a projected 
request of $1.1 million for winter 
2020. 
This year SOFC will be rolling out 
“SOFC 101,” a workshop in which 
organizations can learn about the 
complex 14-page application required 
to request funding for specific events 
or funds such as hosting cultural 
and volunteer events, guest speakers 
and transportation and supplies for 
events.

The show focuses on a 
fictional, 
for-profit 
charter 
school and some of Strassel’s 
former students are part of the 
ensemble. Strassel cast Diane 
Hill, 
his 
former 
Ypsilanti 
High School drama teacher, as 
DeVos. Strassal plays DeVos’ 
husband Dick, the millionaire 
son 
of 
Amway 
co-founder 
Richard DeVos, as well as 
her brother Erik Prince, the 
founder 
of 
Blackwater, 
a 
private 
military 
contractor 
known in part for its role in 
a 2007 shooting of unarmed 
civilians in Iraq. Some of the 
songs include “Jesus Wants 
Me to be Rich” and “The Best 
Kind of Teacher is a Teacher 
with a Gun.” 
Strassel concedes the play 
is a bit extreme, writing on his 
GoFundMe page the show is 
“completely ridiculous.” 
“She says things that sound 
a little ridiculous … so I played 
off of that for sure,” Strassel 
said. “But on the other hand, 
there are some sympathetic 
moments. You know, in a way, 
some of my friends didn’t 
like the fact that I mentioned 
anything positive about her, 
but I think the story is better 
when you find the nuance in 
the character. So yeah, it’s 

very silly, and it’s a parody, 
but I’m going to try to work in 
some complexity.”
Strassel said he tried to see 
things from DeVos’s point of 
view when he was writing the 
musical. 
“I think that there are 
examples of Betsy trying to 
help individual students, and I 
tell that in the story,” Strassel 
said. “There’s one student 
in the story who she pays for 
tuition to a private school, 
and that’s something that she 
has done in public schools — 
she pulled them out and sent 
them to private school. But 
I also point out the flaw in 
that. Though she may have 
good intentions for that kid, 
she is pulling money out of 
the public school system and 
showing her lack of faith and 
in public schools.”
DeVos has been criticized 
by public school advocates for 
considering arming teachers 
and for requesting to cut 
billions of dollars from the 
Department 
of 
Education’s 
budget. 
DeVos 
said 
she 
planned instead to bolster 
scholarships to private school 
scholarships.
In a statement issued in 
March, DeVos defended the 
Trump 
administration’s 
budget request for the 2020 
fiscal year, which would have 
cut approximately $7 billion in 

funding compared with 2019.
“This budget at its core is 
about 
education 
freedom,” 
DeVos 
said. 
“Freedom 
for 
America’s students to pursue 
their 
life-long 
learning 
journeys in the ways and 
places that work best for 
them, freedom for teachers 
to develop their talents and 
pursue their passions, and 
freedom from the top-down 
‘Washington 
knows 
best’ 
approach 
that 
has 
proven 
ineffective and even harmful 
to students.”
Like DeVos, Strassel has his 
own budget priorities. He said 
he hopes to take “Betsy DeVos! 
The Musical!” even further 
than the staged reading, and 
aims to raise $12,500 to bring 
the play to different cities 
next summer before the 2020 
election.
“In the short run, I’d like to 
get some of the songs onto the 
internet, and sort of shared 
digitally,” Strassel said. “But 
my big, long-term goal is a 
fully 
realized 
professional 
production next summer. How 
that happens, I think it could 
be a local thing, but I’m also 
open to the idea that could be a 
small tour, or maybe even that 
the show could be adopted 
by 
a 
professional 
theatre 
elsewhere, and I’m really open 
to that. I’m kind of interested 
to see where it takes me.”

A 

university 
is 
many 
things to its students– 
an 
employer, 
a 
healthcare provider, a landlord, 
a gym, a restaurant, a library, 
an educator, an ISP, a creditor 
and more. Each of these roles 
has data associated with it 
which, 
when 
unified, 
can 
provide an extremely detailed 
picture 
of 
students’ 
lives. 
In today’s world of big data 
there is increasing pressure 
to utilize this information to 
improve students’ college lives. 
Will this lead to surveillance, 
inappropriate interventions and 
the repackaging of biases? Or 
could it set the example for how 
to responsibly and ethically 
utilize data in the future? 
Just as Amazon, Google and 
Facebook are creating models 
to 
predict 
our 
preferences 
and 
behavior, 
universities 
are increasingly looking to 
predictive models for help with 
student 
performance, 
well-
being and retainment. This is an 
area called “learning analytics,” 
and it’s filled with promises to 
improve student outcomes by 
analyzing mounds of data. But 
just as big tech faces a number 
of issues related to predictive 
modeling, universities do as 
well, with perhaps even higher 
stakes. For example, one could 
imagine a tool that recommends 
majors reproducing historical 
norms, steering women and 
minorities away from STEM 
fields. 
Particularly when thinking 
about recommendations and 
interventions, schools will need 
to avoid simply automating 
historical 
stereotypes 
and 
biases. Additionally, as schools 
inevitably turn to third-party 
vendors for help, they will need 
to be rigorous about access 
to student data. Companies’ 
security 
and 
authorization 
practices should be thoroughly 
vetted and monitored to avoid 
letting student data fall into the 
wrong hands. Already, hackers 
are 
increasingly 
targeting 
educational 
institutions 
for 
their valuable information.
Universities 
will 
also 
have to consider what they 
collect. 
To 
date, 
higher 
education has largely avoided 
the surveillance craze found 
in K-12 education, but that 
could easily change. A system 
could be constructed using 

data such as visits to the gym, 
class attendance and browsing 
history to surface potential 
“threats” in the student body. 
Surveillance in a more benign 
form is already found in many 
of the “learning management 
systems” 
used 
by 
schools. 
These 
systems 
often 
track 
minutiae such as keystrokes, 
time spent on assignments, 
and distance scrolled in the 
name of improving student 
performance. 
Additionally, 
schools are embedding trackers 
in 
recruitment 
emails 
that 
monitor things like whether 
prospective students clicked 
any links and how long they read 
to help gauge “demonstrated 

interest” in hopes of increasing 
enrollment rates. These forms 
of surveillance are the tools of 
a system that Shoshana Zuboff, 
an author and retired Harvard 
Business 
School 
professor, 
has 
termed 
“surveillance 
capitalism.” In something like a 
“learning management system,” 
users are monitored for data to 
fuel the creation of predictive 
models that are used with subtle 
cues and rewards to “tune, herd, 
and condition” behavior. Zuboff 
argues that this undermines 
autonomy 
by 
encouraging 
conformity and pushing users 
toward the system designer’s 
most desirable outcomes. If 
universities implement a form 
of 
“surveillance 
capitalism” 
on their campuses, they could 
threaten 
students’ 
personal 
and intellectual development 
by stunting the exploration and 
growth that is crucial to higher 
education.
For 
big 
data 
to 
be 
sustainable, Mark Zuckerberg’s 
mantra of “move fast and 
break things” will need to be 
discarded in favor of discussion, 
user-centered design and input 
from a diverse array of voices. 
Universities are well positioned 
to take this approach because 

of the knowledge, inquiry and 
discussion that is at the core of 
higher education. By tapping 
into 
the 
multidisciplinary 
expertise 
found 
on 
their 
campuses and including experts 
from 
non-technical 
fields 
such as history, sociology and 
anthropology, universities can 
ensure an array of perspectives 
are considered when designing 
technical systems. Additionally, 
universities are more likely to 
take a user-centric approach 
because the student, ideally, is 
whom they aim to serve. Though 
there may be external pressure 
from 
parents, 
donors 
and 
politicians, profit is (typically) 
not at the center of a university, 
making user (student) voices 
more likely to be heard.
Universities are in a unique 
position. With their wealth of 
interdisciplinary 
expertise, 
tradition of discussion and 
responsibility 
to 
students, 
not 
shareholders, 
they 
are 
as 
well-positioned 
as 
any 
organization to get big data 
right. If schools commit to 
transparency, 
discussion 
and student input, they can 
create an environment where 
students are educated about, 
and involved in, the utilization 
of their data. A healthy cycle 
of proposal, discussion and 
continuous consideration could 
emerge. Students, exposed to 
a 
transparent 
development 
process that respects autonomy 
and 
privacy 
while 
also 
considering 
sociocultural 
realities, could be empowered 
to demand the same type of 
treatment in the rest of their 
digital lives. Organizations such 
as non-profits, governments 
and even businesses would have 
a model for how to harness big 
data responsibly and ethically. 
By empowering students and 
creating a proven alternative 
to the big data practices of the 
tech giants, universities could 
challenge the inevitability of 
our every digital interaction 
being tracked, packaged and 
sold. Higher education bills 
itself as an intellectual leader 
that 
enables 
scholars 
and 
students to change the world 
— here’s an opportunity to live 
up to it.

n the recent 1619 Project, 
by The New York Times, 
Jamelle Bouie comments 
on one of the main reasons 
why the political climate in the 
United States today has become 
extremely combative: “America 
holds 
onto 
an 
undemocratic 
assumption from its founding: 
that some people deserve more 
power than others.” For decades, 
the features of our capitalist 
system have translated into an 
attitude that we all exhibit: the 
necessity to compete in order 
to succeed more than the next 
person, with success generally 
measured by monetary gain. As 
a result, Bouie mentions, our 
current system favors those who 
are cutthroat enough to step 
on others and dismiss them for 
being inferior or for lacking some 
qualification.
In the same way that there is 
an unfair distribution of social and 
economic benefits throughout 
our 
country, 
underprivileged 
and marginalized communities 
continue 
to 
suffer 
from 
environmental 
injustice. 
We 
have been able to conceptualize 
this idea on a macroscale, such 
as with the idea that regions 
in North America with more 
wealth to recover from natural 
disasters experience a better 
quality of life than some regions 
of South America or Asia. To our 
misfortune, 
our 
bureaucratic 
system hasn’t been able to realize 
that this phenomenon also exists 
on a microscale within our own 
cities and neighborhoods. That is, 
until now.
Over this summer, graduate 
students attending the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
School 
for 
Environment and Sustainability 
developed a tool to identify 
the 
areas 
of 
environmental 
injustice in the state of Michigan. 
Combining techniques used in 
the tools developed to measure 
environmental 
injustice 
in 
the states of California and 
Minnesota, these students used 
11 environmental indicators and 
six demographic indicators to 
determine a community’s risk 
of exposure to environmental 
hazards and vulnerability due to 
social factors. Ultimately, these 
indicators were used to calculate 
an overall environmental justice 
score for each census tract in 
Michigan. After applying this 
tool, Paul Mohai, a founder of the 
Environmental Justice Program 

at the University and past member 
of the National Environmental 
Justice Advisory Council, was 
able to make a conclusion about 
environmental 
injustice 
in 
Michigan: “A key finding of this 
report is that environmental 
injustice exists across Michigan, 
with residents of low-income 
and 
minority 
communities 
disproportionately burdened by 
environmental 
contamination 
and health risks — just as we saw 
in Flint.”

In 
addition, 
this 
study 
involved 
interviews 
with 
30 
Michigan 
environmental 
justice leaders regarding how 
they 
themselves 
experience 
environmental injustice and how 
they use data and assessment tools 
in general. The study concluded 
that “people” and “community” 
were the most utilized words 
by these environmental justice 
leaders who also responded that 
decisions were influenced more 
often by monetary value than by 
the interest of the people. These 
leaders went on to commend 
affected communities for being 
“resilient despite adversity” and 
noted that difficulties in achieving 
environmental justice in Michigan 
existed due to “lack of political 
will and the erosion of democratic 
processes.” In expressing desire 
to utilize this tool for measuring 
holistic impacts in Michigan, 
these 
leaders 
acknowledged 
that it needs to be administered 
statewide to become effective.
As a result of this study, the 
state of Michigan now has the 
capability to identify the areas 
that need to be prioritized in 
terms 
of 
socioeconomic 
and 
environmental restoration. While 
the statewide implementation of 
this tool is completely feasible, last 
year local and state government 
officials were restricted by the 
lame-duck session, the period 
between an election and the end 
of a lawmaker’s term. Regulations 

were 
to 
proceed 
only 
with 
legislative approval for those new 
operations that exceed federal 
standards. In other words, a vital 
assessment tool that measures 
the extent that environmental 
injustice occurring in our state is 
being limited to a legislative body 
that may or may not understand 
the importance of its immediate 
implementation.
I believe that this tool is 
groundbreaking 
and 
should 
be considered a top priority in 
existing efforts to improve our 
quality of life in Michigan. As 
this tool seeks to identify areas 
of environmental weakness and 
public health shortcomings, I 
believe that a sustainable future 
will be possible with similar tools 
that can be used for restoring 
socioeconomic 
equality 
along 
with a flourishing environment. 
As a student who has invested 
much of my attention and efforts 
into this University that serves 
the student body, I am extremely 
proud of the work that our 
graduate students have done for 
our community and urge that this 
University waste no opportunity 
to promote the beneficial work 
our students do for our state 
legislature.
It’s essential that our state 
legislature 
understands 
the 
necessity 
for 
environmental 
justice 
because, 
as 
we 
can 
expect, a beneficial tool means 
nothing if our legislature doesn’t 
understand why it should be used. 
The greatest misunderstanding 
comes 
from 
neglecting 
marginalized communities, and 
this neglect comes from having 
a 
predisposed 
discrimination 
against a type of person or group 
for what they are. Furthermore, 
it’s important that we urge our 
government not to neglect those 
who are underprivileged and 
disadvantaged because we are 
indirectly hindering the quality of 
our environment as a result. 
There 
is 
a 
plaque 
commemorating 
the 
loss 
of 
Iceland’s first glacier to global 
warming 
that 
reads: 
“This 
monument is to acknowledge that 
we know what is happening and 
what needs to be done. Only you 
know if we did it.” For the sake 
of our future, we must do what 
needs to be done, especially since 
we now know how.

L

ast week, Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass., 
announced her plan for 
criminal justice reform. The 
plan contains a host of changes 
to the current system, but 
one in particular stands out: 
ending the cash bail system. She 
joins eight other presidential 
candidates who also support 
eliminating cash bail. 
To be clear, this does not 
mean eliminating all forms of 
money bail, which the state of 
California did last year. Cash 
bail is one of the primary forms 
of money bail in the United 
States. Another more common 
form is through a bail agent. A 
court will determine a certain 
amount of money to be paid, 
and, rather than pay the full 
amount, the defendant will pay 
a bail agent a small percentage 
of it, which the defendant does 
not get back. If the defendant 
does not show up for court, 
the bail agent must pay the full 
amount, but they can go after 
the person’s assets to be repaid. 
Cash bail, however, is when the 
defendant pays the full bail 
amount to the court and gets 
most of it back (there usually is 
a fee) after showing up for all of 
their proceedings.
The 
problem 
with 
this 
system is that many people 
cannot afford to pay the full 
amount for bail. This puts 
them in the position of having 
to decide whether to go to 
jail or go to a bail bondsman, 
which will be more expensive 
in the long run. In addition, 
courts know that bail agents 
initially require their clients to 
only pay a percentage of their 
bail, so they will set a higher 
amount if they suspect that 
a defendant will go to a bail 
agent. Faced with this choice, 
many defendants choose to go 
to jail. This may be why almost 
half a million people in jail 

have not been convicted. The 
justice system is slow, meaning 
those awaiting trial can spend 
many months or even years 
behind bars.
The 
impacts 
of 
that 
incarceration can be tragic, 
such is the case of Djibril 
Niyomugabo. In Grand Rapids 
in January 2016, Niyomugabo 
was 
charged 
with 
stealing 
a bottle of wine from a car, 
to which he pled not guilty. 
Because he could not post bail, 
he was held in jail. A few days 
later, he was found unconscious 
with 
a 
bedsheet 
wrapped 
around his neck. He was taken 
to a hospital in Grand Rapids 
and died two days later.
Furthermore, 
the 
flaws 
in 
the 
cash 
bail 
system 
disproportionately 
affect 
minorities, 
specifically 
African 
Americans 
and 
Latinx 
individuals. 
Courts 
were less likely to release a 
Black defendant on their own 
recognizance than they were 
white defendants. In addition, 
Black defendants between 18 
and 29 were given higher bail 
amounts than defendants of any 
other race or age.

The problems do not end once 
people are let out. Those who 
are incarcerated for anytime 
longer than a few days can lose 
their jobs, making it harder to 
get their lives back together 
if released. If the defendant 

has a family, losing income 
can make it difficult to make 
ends meet. To avoid putting 
that strain on themselves or 
their families, defendants will 
sometimes simply plead guilty. 
That decision can subject them 
to harsh fines and years of 
probation. In addition, having 
a criminal record makes it 
much harder to get a job, get 
into school and access certain 
public 
benefits. 
This 
also 
increases that likelihood of a 
false conviction, which means 
the real perpetrator would go 
unpunished.
It does not have to be like 
this. There are alternatives 
to a cash bail system, such as 
one Washington, D.C. began 
implementing 
as 
far 
back 
as the 1990s. Rather than 
forcing people to pay money to 
maintain their freedom, they 
determine which defendants 
are most likely to show up for 
trial as well as which ones are 
threats to public safety and 
make a judgment on whether 
to jail them. In this system, 89 
percent of defendants appear 
for their proceedings.
The injustices in the cash 
bail system undermine the 
integrity of the criminal justice 
system as a whole. It is a system 
that jails people based not on 
their guilt or the threat they 
pose to the public, but on their 
ability to pay. Resolving this 
issue is critical to fighting the 
United States’s problem with 
mass 
incarceration. 
Former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden, 
despite 
having 
worked 
on 
the 1994 crime bill that many 
progressives have pointed to 
as being deeply flawed, has 
changed his position on cash 
bail. It is well past time for the 
country to follow suit.

Wednesday, September 4, 2019 — 5A

In the spirit of Welcome Week, 
Festifall and all things post-Labor-
Day, The Michigan Daily Film section 
has written a collection of blurbs 
celebrating our favorite “Openings” 
to movies. Here’s to another year of 
learning, changing, trying, failing, 
crying, 
smiling, 
passing, 
movie-
watching 
and 
(most 
importantly) 
a-best-picture-awarded-to-a-film-
that-surpasses-the-low-bar-of-not-
being-problematic-at-best-and-
severly-discouraging-as-to-the-
current-state-of-the-conversation-on-
racial-equality-in-America-at-worst.

“The Sound of Music” 
“The Sound of Music” might be 
my favorite musical of all time. The 
film, released in 1965, was wildly 
successful, claiming the title of the 
world’s highest-grossing film for half 
a decade, and it’s not hard to see why. 
There’s just something about it — 
the music, the characters, or maybe 
even the story itself — that feels 
timeless and completely irresistible, 
and I think whatever magic it was 
that made “The Sound of Music” so 
popular is encapsulated in its very 

first minutes.
The opening scene of the movie 
is rather simple, capturing Julie 
Andrews (“Mary Poppins”) as Maria 
roaming the fields of Austria in song. 
It’s all we as viewers need to want 
to attach ourselves to the character 
for as long as we possibly can. In 
just these few moments, we discover 
that it’s impossible not to love her. 
She’s charming, fun, determined 
and completely true to herself — 
everything one could possibly ask for 
in a heroine. The song she sings, sweet 
yet sentimental, is elevated to a thing 
of brilliance thanks to Andrews’s 
voice. It’s hard to imagine that anyone 
else on Earth could make a line as 
trite as “my heart wants to sing every 
song it hears” sound as powerful and 
earnest as Julie Andrews does.
Though 
the 
landscape 
that 
surrounds 
Andrews 
is 
beautiful 
— so beautiful it’s almost hard to 
believe it’s a real place — it’s rendered 
trivial with Andrews’s presence. Her 
command of the camera is as natural, 
as obvious as our need to breathe. 
The scene, carried by one of cinema’s 
all-time greatest actresses, truly is a 
thing to behold.

“Back to the Future”
As a whole, I’ve long believed “Back 
to the Future” to be one of the most 
well written films of all time. Every 

line of dialogue sets up another, every 
off-handed joke becomes a central 
piece of the plot. The first scene of 
the film is among one of its finest in 
this regard. The first shot, a slow 
pan across a series of synchronized 
clocks instantly reels the audience 
in, 
simultaneously 
posing 
the 
question of why all of these clocks 
are synchronized while also clearly 
showing that time is what the movie is 
going to be about. A television brings 
us up to speed on stolen plutonium 
that we see in the laboratory moments 
after. By the time Marty McFly blows 
out the gigantic amplifiers a minute 
or two later and realizes he’s late 
for school, we already know exactly 
who this too-cool-for-school slacker 
is. The most ingenious part of this 
opening is when Doc calls Marty on 
the phone. In only about four lines of 
dialogue, we inherently understand 
the friendship between Doc and 
Marty, a friendship that eventually 
becomes the central and emotional 
core of the entire trilogy.
We never ask how a teenaged 
wannabe rock star became friends 
with a crazy inventor. It doesn’t 
matter. In less than four minutes, 
without 
even 
realizing 
it 
the 
audience has accepted a seemingly 
preposterous premise, “The Power 
of Love” begins to play and a perfect 
opening sequence is complete.

To begin: Openings, part two

This piece is part of a September series 
about coming back to Ann Arbor for the 
fall. Writers share their experiences 
with culture over the summer, what they 
missed about Ann Arbor and what has 
changed in the city upon their return. 
Each year I expect everything to have 
changed completely when I return to 
Ann Arbor for the fall. Yet each year, 
as I merge off of highway I-94 with 
suitcases and school supplies in tow, my 
expectations are never met. The city has 
the same street signs, flashing red lights 
and corner stores as it did in months 
prior. Every fall I return to things just 
as I left them. 
My house is the same as it was when I 
left. I come home to a porch full of people 
talking with one another, laughing at 
a joke I’ve been absent for during my 
summer travels. I feel a bit distant from 
the closeness of the housemates who 
have stayed together during the warmer 
days of the year. Yet, they still greet me 
with their familiar smiles. Soon enough, 
it feels as though I’ve never left. 
When I walk into work to pick up this 
week’s schedule, my manager shakes my 
hand hello just as she shook it goodbye 
in May. We’re still serving the same 
special drinks. Even the moody old 
woman who always files complaints is 
there asking for a refund on what she 
ordered. Perhaps the only thing that’s 
different is the new coat of paint on the 
walls. But even that is pretty much the 
same shade of red, just a bit darker. 
My friends are also the same as they 
were before. We laugh at the same inside 
jokes that we always have. We still like 
to hang out at the same spots and eat in 
the same restaurants as we usually do. 
My friends look just as they did when 
we left school, only maybe a bit more 
tan. When I greet them they are alive 
with stories about the past four months, 
eagerly waiting to tell me everything 

I’ve missed while we’ve been apart. I 
want to tell them every single detail of 
 
my summer, too. When I try to relay my 
stories to them, I find myself growing 
frustrated. My words don’t seem to 
do my experiences justice. So much 
happened over the short period of time 
that we’ve been apart. The summer feels 
like a wonderful blur that’s left me a 
different person than I was before.
As Welcome Week wears on, I can 
sense my mind drifting away from the 
dreamy allure of May, June, July and 
August. Soon enough, it’s caught in the 
swing of university life. I feel myself 
shifting to the person I was before I left 
for the summer. I begin to doubt that 
I’ve even changed at all. To my friends, 
I worry, I probably seem exactly the 
same.
I want to feel comforted by the 
routine familiarity of my surroundings 
upon returning to school. Yet, my 
stomach is unsettled. Perhaps it’s 
because I somehow expected Ann 
Arbor to have changed just as much as 
I did over the past four months. Maybe 
these feelings are simply a result of the 
natural progression of getting older. I’m 
an upperclassman now. This is what it 
feels like to be confident in the city I’ve 
lived in for the past two years. This is 
how it feels to no longer want to impress 
those older and with more college 
experience than me. I should be happy 
with how smooth everything is going. 
Yet, what should feel comfortable just 
feels downright unsettling. 
When I was a freshman, I had wanted 
so badly to feel comfortable in Ann 
Arbor. But now, I can’t help but strive 
for some sort of obstacle to overcome. I 
turn off my cell phone and walk a route 
I never have before just to see if I can 
get lost. I know the campus like the 
back of my hand, though, and I get to 
my destination in no time at all. Maybe 
I should be grateful for the confidence 
that comes with familiarity. But it is 
only human nature to desire what we 
can’t have. And right now, all I want is 
to be uncomfortable.

Uncomfortable starts

FILM NOTEBOOK

ELISE GODFRYD
Daily Arts Writer

Take any page from Oyinkan 
Braithwaite’s novel “My Sister, 
the Serial Killer,” and it’s clear 
that Korede, Braithwaite’s main 
character, has troubles with men. 
Her difficulties bleed through all 
two-hundred pages of the debut, 
in flashback and in her present 
storytelling. But thanks to — you 
guessed it — her serial killer of a 
sister, these men are 
frequently long-dead 
by the time Korede 
deals with them. And 
that’s only the start of 
her problems.
After 
a 
murder 
mystery made it onto 
last 
year’s 
Booker 
Longlist, 
it’s 
not 
surprising 
that 
an 
outwardly 
genre-
bending novel such 
as Braithwaite’s has 
made it onto 2019’s 
literary list. The story 
opens unabashedly as 
a thriller with Korede 
scrubbing blood from 
the caulking of a bathroom floor. 
The chapter is called “bleach.” 
It’s the third time that her sister, 
Ayoola, has murdered a man, and 
it’s the third time Korede’s helped 
her discard the body. Clinging 
to sibling loyalty, from the get-
go Korede appears unwilling to 
intervene in this pattern of crime. 
It’s intriguing, and it’s believable. 
The two continue forward — the 
Lagos police never terribly far 
behind 
— 
until 
Ayoola 
begins 
dating Tade, the embarrassingly 
oblivious doctor from Korede’s 
workplace whom she is also in 
love with. Quickly, “My Sister” 
evolves into a drama of sibling 
rivalry, 
disproportionate 
power 

and self-sacrifice with a seasoning 
of murder.
Most 
apparent 
— 
and 
disappointing — in “My Sister” 
is 
that 
Braithwaite’s 
writing 
never manages to escape a brisk, 
cataloguing thriller style. And the 
story unravels, passages are slowly 
reduced in length until readers 
are left with half-page chapters 
that serve as flashbacks — a page-
turner tactic that, perhaps lazily, 
functions to give half-glances into 
truth that keeps you reading. These 
blips, often ending in almost-

cliffhanger 
dialogue 
passages, 
push “My Sister” back into line 
with other thriller-esque novels. 
There’s nothing literarily fantastic 
about this type of prose. A pattern 
of 
Agatha 
Christie 
influence 
practically moves the pages for 
readers, and makes obvious that 
Braithwaite knows her characters 
and story. But it also makes “My 
Sister” an odd, too-comfortable 
choice for a Booker longlist.
What the debut does prove, 
however, 
is 
that 
Braithwaite 
will not be limited in her future 
storytelling. Kicking out calculated 
law 
sequences 
or 
gore-over-
character tactics the genre often 
beckons, the space is filled with 

well-developed relationships and 
intricate questions that Braithwaite 
leaves often unanswered. Korede 
and Ayoola’s bond is the most 
believable, with the two character’s 
motives particularly complex as 
Ayoola’s habits threaten to force 
the two into becoming opponents. 
Korede’s reliability becomes weaker 
through the novel, making the 
relationship but more convincing as 
this disconnect from reality chips 
away at the sisters’s bond.
What 
one 
would 
guess 
has 
attracted literature fanatics to the 
“My Sister, the Serial 
Killer” 
is 
almost 
surely 
Braithwaite’s 
ability 
to 
handle 
these 
relationships 
and mature themes 
within 
the 
thriller 
environment. 
Abuse 
as 
a 
theme 
slowly rises to the 
surface of the debut. 
Braithwaite holds her 
cards carefully here, 
thankfully 
reluctant 
to 
force 
symbolism 
or 
dramatization 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
moving 
her 
novel 
into a higher literary 
caliber. Rather, such themes exist 
peacefully alongside the serial-
killing fireworks of the novel. 
Korede’s situation becomes less 
about the thrill of the kill and more 
about the morality of each of the 
characters in their day-to-day lives. 
By the climax of the novel, readers 
are invested in much more than just 
the desire to know who Ayoola will 
kill next.
Do great novels have to be 
groundbreaking? Probably not. “My 
Sister” can be a sufficient piece of 
fiction without offering anything 
revolutionary. Still, with a stack 
of potential literary prizes, the 
debut feels like it has only brushed 
against its potential.

‘My Sister’ debuts with grace

BOOK REVIEW

JOHN DECKER
Daily Book Review Editor

My summer started with tragedy. 
It was May 12 to be exact, mere days 
after the flurry of finals and packing 
and goodbyes came to an end. I had one 
more goodbye to give, one I had been 
dreading for years yet simultaneously 
counting down the days to. May 12 — 
the day that “Veep” ended. 
Since 2012, I have been enamored 
with “Veep.” It was a show I started 
watching with my mother — before I 
realized it might be too raunchy for 
a tween — and one that I caught up 
with in my freshman year of college. 
It might just be one of the greatest 
shows of all time. In all of its humor, 
its topics and its beautifully developed 
and truly awful characters, “Veep” 
is the near-perfect TV show. I could 
fill pages with what the best quips 
are, the best missed jokes or most 
underappreciated character, but there 
is one aspect of the show that solidifies 
its title as best comedy, that carries 
the weight of “Veep” on their skirt 
suit-clad back. I mean, of course, the 
venomous Selina Meyer — commonly 
known as Julia Louis-Dreyfus. 
Summer 2019 was the summer of 
JLD. Following the conclusion of 
“Veep,” I went anywhere to get my 
fix. I watched and read all interviews 
or profiles of Louis-Dreyfus and the 
“Veep” cast, the best being an in-depth 
look at the shooting of the finale 
episode by Jen Chaney at Vulture. 
When I couldn’t find more interviews, 
I watched Louis-Dreyfus accept her 
many, well-deserved awards. In one 
speech, she brings up Tony Hale, 
who played Selina Meyer’s obsessive 
right-hand man Gary on “Veep.” Hale 
and Dreyfus say in character as she 
accepts the award, Hale whispering in 
her ear the people to thank much like 
Gary whispered in Selina Meyer’s ear 
the names and facts of ambassadors 
she was forced to meet with. 
Even with these interviews and 
speeches, without “Veep” I had nothing 
to I looked forward to watching. There 
was a brief, glorious detour to Phoebe 
Waller-Bridge’s incredible “Fleabag,” 
but after those two magnificent six-
episode seasons, I was back in my 
“Veep” gloom. And so, I did what any 
other desperate, lost person would do: 
I rewatched “Seinfeld.” 
It’s a standard line to say that 
women can’t be funny. It’s pretty 

much the central conflict of Amazon’s 
incredible 
period 
series 
“The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Women can 
be pretty, helpful, maybe even smart 
if you don’t listen too closely. But one 
thing they can never be? Funny. Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus has been shattering 
this sexist misconception since 1989, 
when she was cast in “Seinfeld” 
because NBC executives demanded 
that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David 
add a woman to the central cast. 
Thank you, NBC executives, for being 
just a smidge more progressive than 
Seinfeld and David, because this 
contractual condition introduced the 
world to Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine 
Benes, and she’s been unstoppable 
ever since. 
“Seinfeld” was always a constant in 
my life — it’s my dad’s favorite show 
and the syndicated program I would 
watch every day when I was home 
sick from school. Some people really 
hate the show. Some people really 
love it. I’ve felt both ways towards the 
show, but my love for Elaine Benes 
is unstoppable. She’s neurotic, edgy, 
troublesome and has an enviable head 
of hair. Her often failed trysts with 
New York City’s men are addictive 
to watch unravel, and her tendency 
to shove her friends as a reaction to 
intense emotion is near-poetic. In 
“Seinfeld,” Dreyfus was a master 
of physical comedy. Her shoves and 
“the Elaine dance” because so iconic 
and well-known that “Broad City” 
stars Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer 
composed a contemporary dance to 
honor them at Dreyfus’s Mark Twain 
Award ceremony. 
Watching “Seinfeld” as a successor 
to “Veep” leads to the realization 
that Elaine Benes and Selina Meyer 
aren’t really all that different. That 
doesn’t mean Dreyfus lacks depth 
and mobility with the characters she 
plays — quite the contrary. Elaine 
is an oddball New Yorker in a show 
about nothing. Selina is the president 
of the United States in a show about 
everything. But through Dreyfus the 
two epochal characters are one — 
in their stiff, awkward moments of 
physical comedy, in their inability 
to ever escape the incompetence 
of the men around them, in their 
misadventures and missteps. Elaine 
and Selina aren’t just funny women, 
they are women who are funny in 
the exact way women shouldn’t be: 
Improper, immoral, foulmouthed and 
graceless.

Every line of dialogue sets up another, every off-handed joke 
becomes a central piece of the plot


The focus of Taylor Swift’s Lover 
is right in the title. From her love for 
her boyfriend and mom, to her love for 
being in love, Swift has clearly dedicated 
this album to the people and things she 
loves the most. Lover 
is hopeful, challenging 
and suggests there’s a 
certain kind of freedom 
in heartbreak. 
Unlike 
the 
dark 
edginess of her 2017 
album 
Reputation, 
Lover feels more like a 
sequel to her pop album 
1989, 
glitter 
and 
all. 
Swift traded her snakes 
and 
hard 
edges 
for 
butterflies and hues of pastel, a symbol for 
the way she’s choosing to brand herself as 
a lover rather than a fighter. 
And the “lover” brand suits her 
quite well Lover has more emotional 
depth than Reputation and shows a new 
level of maturity for Swift. While her 
previous albums are full of black-and-
white juxtapositions to describe love and 
relationships, Swift admits these things 
are not as clear as night and day when she 
sings “I once believed love would be black 
and white/but it’s golden.” 
The kind of love we see in Lover goes 
beyond Swift’s romantic escapades. One 
of the most intimate songs on the album is 

an ode to Swift’s mother, who is battling 
cancer, titled “Soon You’ll Get Better.” 
Unlike some of her recent songs, Swift 
doesn’t retreat from detailed lyrics and 
gives a taste of the old Taylor with the 
storytelling capacity she is so well known 
for. 
In fact, Swift teased fans for the return 
of Old Taylor with the pre-release of the 
album’s title track, “Lover.” The song has 

all the elements of any early Taylor Swift 
song: Christmas lights, romance and of 
course, a catchy tune. 
While Lover is largely a celebration of 
love, some of the album’s tracks still hold 
the aggression from her Reputation era. 
In the album’s most controversial tune 
“You Need To Calm Down,” Swift directly 
calls out anti-gay protestors, declaring 
“shade never made anybody less gay,” and 
portrays them as angry country bumpkins 
in the music video. “The Man” is also 
very pointed at sexism, yet showcases 
Swift’s humor. “Every conquest I had 
would make me more of a boss to you,” she 
sings impassively, highlighting a slew of 

double standards she’s faced in the music 
business. 
Lover has certainly been a place for 
Swift to grow in her lyrics, but musically, 
she still tends to lean into pop style with 
ethereal synthesizer pulses and strategic 
key changes. “Cruel Summer” is the 
epitome of Swift’s signature style with 
dreamy high notes and light hearted 
chants in the bridge: “I don’t want to keep 
secrets just to keep you!”

What’s 
most 

surprising in Lover is 
its country undertones, 
taking us back to Swift’s 
roots as a country music 
artist. Swift recruited 
the Dixie Chicks for 
delicate 
background 
vocals in “Soon You’ll 
Get Better,” while the 
title 
track 
similarly 
contains traces of the 
country swing Swift made her name with. 
After 
the 
surprising 
release 
of 
Reputation, no one was quite sure where 
Taylor Swift would take her career next. 
Lover feels like a step back into common 
territory and suggests Reputation is 
the farthest Swift will tread from her 
traditional style. While she may be finding 
refuge in the music she built her career 
on, Lover points to a way forward as Swift 
seems to have shifted her focus to her 
own experiences rather than defending 
herself. Lover is intriguing, thoughtful 
and relatable; Taylor Swift has once again 
given us a collection of songs to sing, cry 
and dance to.

ALBUM REVIEW

My tire was blasting out air from 
its bent valve stem, visibly deflating. 
It was flat in 15 minutes. I had a bum 
tire in a small northern town, over 
200 miles from home, on a holiday 
weekend. For those of you not from 
the Midwest, this is a calamity of 
the highest magnitude. Every auto 
shop was closed, every mechanic 
at home with their families. I was 
given a phone number. “Here,” the 
voice on the phone said. “This guy 
might be able to help you.”
I drove to County Line Road, 
pulling in front of a white barn 
behind a stout brick house. The 
barn was surrounded by trees, 
cars sagging in the dirt and stray 
cats. I crept to the door of the barn, 
calling out a wary “Hello?” I was 
met by clanging and crashing as a 
large man emerged from the back 
of the barn, accompanied by a white 
dog with white eyes. He shook my 
hand and took my tire, driving 
northwest to Cheboygan. He came 
back somewhere around three 
hours later, the tire’s valve stem 
completely repaired.
In the brief moments I spent 
with this man while he changed 
my tire, I think I came to know him 
well enough. He was a veteran who 
served two tours in the Middle East 
as a medic. Having been injured, 
they sent him home on disability. He 
has seizures in his frontal lobe that 
make him forget things. He spends 
his spare time tinkering with cars 
and other machines in the barn he’d 
built himself, complete with a loft, 
where he lives. His dog, Ghost, was 
a rescue from an abusive family. 
Ten cats freely roam his modest 
property of ten acres. I learned that 
he’d lived just about everywhere, 

from Detroit, to El Paso, to cities 
in the Middle East as a civilian 
mechanic for the Air Force. He had 
family who fought on both sides of 
the Civil War.
He fixed cars not for income, but 
for something to do, and he did it 
well. “Lots of people come up here 
for holidays and weekends, and 
they get stuck,” he said. “Any of 
the mechanics around here would 
probably take advantage of you.” 
But he assured me he wouldn’t. 
In fact, he didn’t even care about 
turning a profit. He charged me 
$25 total and gave me some free car 
advice.
He told me about the stray tools 
he’d come to acquire over the years, 
like a full woodworking set he got 
as a gift for helping a man move. 
We talked about all his dreams, too, 
most of which involve improving 
his home, with oak siding and 
homemade sheds to house his tools. 
His clowder of cats slinked and 
rolled around in the dirt in front of 
the barn.
Meeting this man reminded me 
that I ought to be thankful. Here was 
someone who spent a large portion 
of his young life serving his country, 
had suffered for it and come home. 
He spends his days tinkering and 
helping people not for money, but 
because that’s what he wants to do. 
The Midwest is home to incredible 
people with even more incredible 
stories. We are a collection of people 
from every corner of possibility. I 
drove away down M-32 humbled, 
the red-tipped trees hugging the 
road, awash in the golden glow of 
oncoming fall. The very best of us 
are hidden in the corners of the 
Midwest, tucked into homemade 
barns on the side of the road or in 
sleepy, pine-covered small towns. 
If you get stuck in Onaway, go see 
Wade. He’ll take care of you. He 
tinkers, and he is the very best of us.

Here was someone who spent 
a large portion of his young life 
serving his country, had suffered for 
it and come home

I learned that Mac Miller died 
while I was walking back from a 
football game one year ago. I don’t 
remember who played, what day 
it was or who I went with. But I 
remember that moment. “RIP MAC 
MILLER” was spray-painted in light 
blue on a slab of wood against a frat 
house. I remember thinking it was 
probably a loss that Mac Miller died, 
that he probably had a lot of potential 
moving forward — but not much 
beyond that. Not to pull a Pitchfork, 
but it was hard to envision Miller 
as anything beyond a frat-boy icon. 
I listened to half of his legendary 
debut album Blue Slide Park years 
ago in middle school after listening 
to his feature with Ariana Grande on 
“The Way,” but I disliked it and never 
revisited him until the night of his 
passing when I got back to my dorm 
room. 
Don’t get me wrong — I still despise 
Blue Slide Park. The thing with Mac, 
the thing I hadn’t realized until 
years later, was that he was an ever-
evolving artist, one who reinvented 
himself with every album. Defined by 
an artistry that never quite fit into a 
genre, to a common clique of people, 
Miller continuously shed the party-
rap persona until his discography 
was spattered with jazzy beats and 
despondent lyricism. This was his 
magnum opus, Swimming. Following 
his 
break 
up 
with 
Grande, 
an 
infamous DUI and terrifying dive 
into substance abuse, Swimming was 
placed at the center of his life as a 
promise to stay af loat among the 
chaos. 
The songs shift effortlessly from 
one to the other in the same fuzzy, 
contemplative 
packaging. 
Never 
precisely sad or depressing, the 
album is imbued with an exasperated 
hope, one that searches when the 
struggle seems lost. Did this haziness 
make 
distinctions 
between 
the 
beginning and end of songs harder 
to identify? Yes, just as much as it 
made some songs not worth listening 
to 
individually. 
Swimming 
is 
admittedly defined by its danceable 
highlights 
like 
“Ladders” 
and 
“What’s the Use?” But as a concept 
album, it stands among the most 
cohesive I’ve ever listened to. Its 
message to maintain a semblance of 
hope and self-improvement despite 
the jarring reality of addiction, 
depression and heartbreak is at the 
forefront, radiating lyrically as well 
as sonically. It might get a bit stale 
at times, but I couldn’t help but 
immerse myself into the experience 
the first time I listened. Like it or 
not Miller is a master at conveying 
how he feels through music. Not a 

single day has gone by 
since my first listen that I 
haven’t listened to a track 
from Swimming. 
This is why it was such 
a travesty that he passed 
away. He had a lot more 
to live for at 26 years old. 
This is not only apparent 
sonically in the evolution 
of his musical stylings, 
but 
also 
within 
his 
thematic musings as well. 
“I had a plan to change, 
you can’t stand the rain 
/ Little delay, but I came 
and you’re cool with it / I 
don’t trip, f lip or lose my 
grip / And I don’t know 
it all but I do know this / 
Before you know me better 
know yourself / I’ve been 
in this shit so long that it 
don’t smell,” he raps in “Ladders.” 
Even his social media embodies 
much the same themes, taking a more 
somber and inspirational turn those 
last few months of his life. In the 
place of his general, off beat humor, 
one of his last tweets reads “I just 
wanna go on tour.”
His death now stands as a cruel 
twist of irony to fans who adored 
him — he had a plan to get better, to 
make more music, but it’s impossible 
now. A lot of this is translated in 
the memory of him. His “Self Care” 
music video depicting him escaping a 
coffin despite being buried alive, an 
homage to “Kill Bill Vol. 2,” is jarring 
foreshadowing for a song with the 
lyrics “Swear the height be too tall 
(Yeah) / So like September I fall.” 
Like many artists who have passed 
young before him, Mac Miller has 
been immortalized in the gestures of 
fans and other artists alike. As the 
anniversary of his death approaches, 
we’ve witnessed multiple tributes 
in his honor, some upcoming ones 
in cities from New Orleans on the 
seventh to the iconic Blue Slide 
Park itself in Pittsburgh. 
Artists 
like 
Childish 
Gambino, 
Anderson 
Paak, 
Ty 
Dollar 
$ign, 
Thundercat 
and 
many 
more 
have 
honored 
him 
in 
performances, 
acknowledging not only 
deft musical stylings but 
his humanity. “He was 
the sweetest guy, he was 
so nice,” Gambino said as 
he cut his performance 
of “Riot” short during a 
Chicago performance last 
year.
However, 
no 
other 
artist 
has 
honored 
Miller’s memory the way 
ex-girlfriend 
Ariana 
Grande has, symbolically 
donning a pale blue Zac 
Posen 
Cinderella 
gown 

at this year’s Grammy Awards and 
subsequently 
posting 
a 
rant 
on 
Twitter lamenting Miller’s loss for 
Best Album. Her “Thank U, Next” 
album is defined by her grieving for 
Miller, from sly lyrics that direct 
back to her late ex’s music to her 
description of it as a healing project 
at a point in her life in which she 
describes as “so drunk and so sad.” 
Homages to Miller are even scattered 
throughout her most recent tour. A 
stop at Pittsburgh was introduced 
with Miller’s music playing before 
Grande’s appearance, a seat in his 
honor near the front and Grande 
struggling to keep it together as she 
sang songs written about him.
As the anniversary of his death 
approaches, 
Miller’s 
name 
is 
resurfacing across news and the 
Internet. From the surge of tweets 
mourning him, unreleased tracks put 
out in his honor and tributes in cities 
across the US, his memory hasn’t 
evaded fans and friends alike. It’ll be 
one year since Mac Miller has passed 
away, yet his legacy makes it feel like 
he never left.

Play while tired.
For the Michigan women’s field 
hockey team, this mantra shapes 
everything. Early in the season, 
the Wolverines are trying to 
create their identity — an identity 
that puts playing through fatigue 
and adversity at the forefront. 
From quick, explosive starts to 
high-effort plays late in matches, 
intensity is the name of the game.
No. 7 Michigan (1-1) showcased 
this mindset Sunday during a 3-0 
victory over No. 10 Wake Forest 
(0-2). 
From the first minute, the 
Wolverines’ high-effort mentality 
made its mark. Michigan worked 
hard to suffocate the Demon 
Deacons’ elusive style of play from 
the outset. These efforts paid off 
early and often, as the Wolverines 
scored on two corner shots in the 
first half.
For Michigan, the recipe was 
simple. Draw a corner. Have 
sophomore midfielder Kathryn 
Peterson smack the ball to the top 
of the circle. Line up a shot for 
senior forward Meg Dowthwaite. 
Find the back of the cage. Repeat.
This strategy worked twice in 
the first half for the Wolverines 
who jumped out to a commanding 
2-0 lead at the half. Scoring 
successfully off corner shots seems 
to be a staple of the offense early 
in the season, as Michigan scored 
twice off them against No. 1 North 
Carolina on Friday, as well.
But this hasn’t always been 
the case for the Wolverines who 
struggled mightily to capitalize on 
corner shots last season. This year, 
the corners are coming with a new 
mindset and with them, much-
needed offensive production.
“Last year, our corners were not 
great to say the least,” Peterson 
said. “This year, it’s a new 
mentality. This year we all know 
we have so much improvement to 
do there, that this year coming into 
these games, they’re just clicking.”

The intensity didn’t stop at just 
drawing corners. The lone goal in 
the second half came courtesy of 
Peterson, who scored off a heater 
that rocketed off the goalkeeper’s 
gloves and over her head to cross 
the goal line. 
The 
beatdown 
marked 
a 
statement win for the Wolverines. 
After losing 4-2 against the Tar 
Heels in the first game of the 
season, Michigan wanted to right 
the ship and start the year off with 
a bang. The Wolverines needed 
to show that they could not only 
play with, but also beat, elite 
competition.
“(The win was) huge,” said 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz. 
“I mean to be 1-1 instead of 0-2, but 
they’re both top-five teams, and 
most importantly this is a process, 
right? We’re trying to grow and 
get better and challenge ourselves 

every time and see where we are, 
and I feel really great about it.”
From here, the name of the game 
for the Wolverines is to maintain 
that intensity through a long 
season. They’ve proven they can 
do it through a game and come out 
the other side victorious, cutting 
off passing lanes and intercepting 
balls deep into the fourth quarter. 
Carrying on their identity for the 
rest of the season will now be the 
team’s focus. For now, the most it 
can do is hammer the message of 
playing while tired and hope the 
rest takes care of itself.
“Marcia says that every single 
day,” Dowthwaite said. “The best 
players are playing while tired, 
you’re not going to be not tired 
when you’re playing. You got to be 
able to capitalize and score and play 
well when you’re tired, so we say 
that everyday.”

A quick glance at the stat 
sheet would suffice to show 
penalty corners played a big part 
in the No. 7 Michigan women’s 
field hockey team’s 3-0 victory 
Sunday afternoon.
While the Wolverines (1-1) 
scored two goals off corners 
against No. 10 Wake Forest (0-2) 
on Sunday, it was Michigan’s 
defensive press that sparked 
offensive production and led to 
those corners.
When the Wolverines lost 
possession while attacking, their 
players charged relentlessly at 
the Demon Deacons and forced 
them to make mistakes. From 
there, Michigan looked to cut 
off the passing lanes. This was 
the team’s key strategy going 

into the contest.
“Well for this game, we 
knew they were really strong 
at transferring out of the back,” 
said 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Kathryn Peterson. “And so what 
we would try to do was cut them 
to one side and try to take away 
those long passing lanes, and 
pressure as high as possible.”
With the press, Michigan 
often 
won 
back 
possession 
quickly. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
Wolverines spent the majority 
of the game on the attacking 
side of the field. This yielded the 
scoring chances, including four 
corners and five total shots on 
goal.
“That’s 
an 
emphasis,” 
said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “That’s kind of our 
team personality. Our team 
character 
is 
to 
play 
great 

team defense and step up and 
intercept. And I thought we did 
it beautifully today, and I was 
really proud of them.”
It is still early in the season, 
but the press is already a staple 
of the team’s practice regimen. 
Specifically, Michigan focuses 
on ensuring that the intensity is 
a team effort.
“We 
train 
really 
hard, 
someone loses the ball and 
you’ve gotta fight to get it 
back,” said senior forward Meg 
Dowthwaite. “I think we’re 
practicing at the minute how 
we train which is really intense 
and really good, and everyone 
works together as a team, it’s not 
individual. 
“If your teammate loses the 
ball, everyone gets behind it. 
It’s not just that person that lost 
the ball, which I think is really 
important.”
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
contest of the season, against 
No. 1 North Carolina, the press 
wasn’t consistent throughout 
the game. Michigan brought 
the intensity early and notched 
a one-goal lead after the first 
quarter. 
The 
Wolverines 
couldn’t sustain it, though, and 
suffered a 4-2 loss.
By Sunday, Michigan made 
enough adjustments to get back 
on track.
“We started really strong 
against UNC, and then we 
backed off a bit,” Dowthwaite 
said. “So I think it was important 
for us to keep that intensity the 
whole game, even intercepting 
balls which we were able to do 
up until the last whistle, so I 
was really happy with that, and 
that’s what we really took away.”
Dowthwaite views the press 
as a central part of the program. 
As a senior, one of her goals is 
to teach the younger players the 
intricacies so that they can get 
more involved.
Taking Sunday’s success as an 
example, this tactic could pay 
dividends down the road.

Sophomore midfielder Kathryn Peterson scored the lone goal of the second half in Michigan’s 3-0 victory over Wake Forest on Sunday afternoon.

Michigan falls to FGCU, bounces back with Monday win against SIUE

In just the sixth minute of 
the match, Florida Gulf Coast 
forward Ryan Medilah found 
himself wide open in the box 
and buried a flawless cross 
from 
fellow 
forward 
Shak 
Adams, silencing the opening 
night crowd at the U-M Soccer 
Stadium on Friday night. 
The header was the first of 
three goals from Medilah, as 
the Michigan men’s soccer team 
(0-1) fell 4-3 to the Eagles (1-0). 
For the Wolverines, the match 
was defined by poor defense 
and an inability to convert 
on second half opportunities 
offensively. 
Medilah followed his first 
goal with a free kick eight 
minutes later from the right 
corner of the box. His low 
line drive cross snuck past 
Michigan’s defense and froze 
senior 
goalkeeper 
Andrew 
Verdi as it trickled across the 
goal line, giving FGCU an early 
2-0 lead. 
Despite 
lackluster 
play 
on defense, the Wolverines 
managed to even the score 
at two before halftime. A 
well-placed ground ball from 
freshman forward Christian 
Pulselli gave junior forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi 
an 
easy 
goal in the 30th minute, which 
graduate 
transfer 
forward 
Nebojsa Popovic 
followed with a 
cheeky tap-in on 
a free kick from 
senior forward 
Jack Hallahan.
At the start 
of the second 
half, 
Michigan 
seemed 
poised 
to take the lead 
with 
Hallahan 
and 
Popovic 
leading a strong 
offensive push. In just the third 
minute of the half, Popovic 
earned 
an 
opportunity 
in 
front of the goal, but Eagles’ 
keeper 
Gustavo 
Vasconcelos 
gobbled it up with ease. The 
Wolverines tallied 11 shots in 
the second half, including a 

point-blank opportunity from 
Popovic that forced a diving 
save from Vasconcelos. But 
they converted on only one of 
these opportunities, when a 
late-game corner from junior 
midfielder Marc Ybarra found 
junior defender Joel Harrison 
with enough space to notch 
Michigan’s 
third and final 
goal. 
The 
Wolverines 
would 
come 
to 
regret 
these 
missed 
opportunities, 
as Medilah’s hat-
trick goal and a 
dazzling strike 
from 
FGCU 
midfielder Ivan 
Rosales put the match out of 
reach. 
“I think we created enough 
chances to win the game,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “(But) they were more 
opportunistic 
in 
the 
sense 
of taking their chances on 

our minor mistakes in the 
midfield.”
Popovic put up impressive 
numbers on his first regular 
season game since transferring 
from Oakland University as a 
graduate student. He tallied 
three shots — all on target — 
on top of his first half goal. 
His decisiveness and quick 
shooting complements the elite 
ball control and passing ability 
of 
preseason 
All-American 
Hallahan, and the pair seems 
poised to make a big splash for 
the Wolverines. 
“Popovic is a good player,” 
Daley 
said. 
“We’re 
excited 
about having him in our group, 
and the hard part is figuring 
out all the pieces around these 
guys.”
“We need to find ways to get 
(Hallahan) the ball, because 
he’s a special player as well,” he 
added. “Regardless, our team 
defending has to get better. ... 
It let us down a little tonight, 
but we’ll work on it, we’ll get 
better, and we’ll grow from the 
experience.”

It happened in a flash and 
to the amazement of almost all 
those in attendance. 
With just under four minutes 
remaining and the Wolverines 
probing for a go-ahead goal, the 
ball was played back to Southern 
Illinois University Edwardsville 
goalkeeper Noah Heim. What 
was supposed to be a routine 
clearance turned into anything 
but as Michigan sophomore 
forward Derick Broche came 
flying in to block his kick. 
The 
ball 
ricocheted 
off 
Broche and into the path of 
fellow 
Wolverine 
Nebojsa 
Popovic. With Heim chasing 
back towards goal and the 
Cougar 
defenders 
out 
of 
position, Popovic coolly finished 
off the unexpected opportunity 
to restore Michigan’s one-goal 
advantage.
SIUE 
(0-1-1) 
could 
never 
recover 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
(1-1-0) added another late goal 
to complete their less than 

straightforward 3-1 victory. 
The intensity was there for 
Michigan from the opening 
whistle. Having lost their home 
opener to Florida Gulf Coast 
University, the Wolverines came 
out energetic and eager to start 
Monday’s game off on the right 
foot. A goal 3:50 into the game 
from 
Broche 
accomplished 
exactly 
that. 
Junior winger 
Umar 
Farouk 
Osman sent a 
deep cross into 
the box, which 
Broche 
met 
with a leaning 
header. 
After 
missing 
the 
entirety of his freshman season 
recovering from a broken leg 
he suffered at the end of high 
school, Broche’s header marked 
his first career goal and came in 
his career start. 
“For me it means everything,” 
Broche, who had a metal rod 
inserted in his leg, said. “I’ve 

been coming to this field since 
I was a kid. And last year going 
through that, it just means all 
the more. I’m just happy that 
I was able to help the team in 
anyway I can.”
The Wolverines looked well 
in control the rest of the half. 
Though 
Michigan 
was 
still 
working out some early-season 
kinks for much of the first 
half, its energy alone held the 
Cougars in check — allowing 
only one shot on goal. 
Much of the second half was 
punctuated by missed chances 
from the Wolverines. On a 
number of occasions, senior 
forward Jack Hallahan glided 
through 
the 
SIUE 
midfield 
and played pinpoint passes to 
Michigan’s forwards, who failed 
to capitalize. 
“We didn’t take our chances,” 
Daley said. “I think we created 
enough chances to make the 
game not as unnervy as it was 
at the end. I think the big thing 
for us is, we want to give our 
team a chance to win the game, 
and if we don’t take some of our 
chances, we gotta make sure we 
hold them on defense.” 
Those missed opportunities 
came back to bite the Wolverines 
when the visitors nabbed the 
tying goal out of seemingly 
nothing. Cougar forward Jorge 
Gonzalez got on the end of 
a cross from the right wing 
and nodded it past Wolverine 
goalkeeper 
Andrew Verdi in 
the 74th minute. 
The 
goal 
took 
the air out of the 
stadium and ten 
tense 
minutes 
followed 
until 
Popovic 
scored 
off 
the 
Broche 
deflection. 
Broche secured 
the win by firing 
his second goal of the day into 
the roof of the net after some 
nifty footwork to get into the 
six-yard box moving the score 
to 3-1. 
“Ultimately, we found a way 
to win though,” Daley said. “I 
think that’s a big piece of the 
puzzle early on in the season.”

Wolverines top Oakland, Northern Arizona

For the Michigan volleyball 
team, Friday’s matches couldn’t 
have come sooner.
The 15th-ranked Wolverines 
(2-0) have opened their season 
this deep into the calendar only 
once since 2004. But despite 
the long preseason, they didn’t 
show any signs of being behind 
the curve in a 25-18, 25-23, 25-8 
sweep of Oakland (1-1) in the first 
match of the annual Michigan 
Invitational before fending off 
an upset bid against Northern 
Arizona (1-1) in a 25-18, 19-25, 
14-25, 
25-17, 
15-10 
nightcap 
victory.
Michigan used an efficient 
offense to grab an early lead, 
recording 
nine 
kills 
before 
committing 
an 
attack 
error 
against Oakland. Senior setter 
MacKenzi 
Welsh 
dished 
out assists to four different 
Wolverines in that span, keeping 
the Golden Grizzlies’ defense on 
their heels as Michigan widened 
the gap to as many as nine before 
closing the set.
The Wolverines picked up 
right where they left off in the 
second frame, racing out to a 
5-0 advantage following a trio 
of Oakland errors. The Golden 
Grizzlies promptly shaved the 
deficit to three, but an 8-2 run 
gave Michigan the breathing 
room it needed to stave off a late 
push. Oakland took 12 of the 
next 15 points, tying the set at 
23 points apiece. With the score 
knotted, freshman opposite May 
Pertofsky buried two consecutive 
kills to give the Wolverines a two-
set advantage. 
Pertofsky and fellow freshman 
sensation Jess Robinson — the 
nation’s No. 8 recruit, according 
to Prep Volleyball — put on a 
show in their Michigan debuts. 
The duo paced the offense with 
a combined 17 kills on just 22 
attempts while hitting out of the 
middle and at the right side pin.
Beyond the freshmen, Welsh 
maintained a balanced attack 
throughout the match. Following 
the graduation of offensive focal 
point Carly Skjodt, who took 
over 60 swings in some matches 

last year, a quintet of Wolverines 
recorded at least five kills, with 
Pertofsky leading the pack at 
a match-high nine. Michigan 
posted 
a 
.394 
team 
attack 
percentage — a major spike from 
last year’s collective .227 clip — 
even without sophomore middle 
blocker Kayla Bair, who sustained 
an ankle sprain at Thursday’s 
practice.
The Golden Grizzlies rode 
the momentum of their rally 
attempt to their first lead of the 
match in the early stages of the 
third set, but it 
didn’t take long 
for Michigan to 
drop the hammer 
soon after. With 
the Wolverines up 
10-8, Welsh went 
back to serve and 
took 
her 
team 
across the finish 
line, serving 15 
straight points to 
close the match 
on a memorable run.
If there’s one area where 
Michigan 
needed 
to 
prove 
something on Friday, it was ball 
control. Jenna Lerg — whose 
1,966 digs are the second-most 
in program history — graduated 
last spring, leaving the door open 
for junior libero Natalie Smith to 
step in and take the reins of the 
team’s defense. Though there was 

a handful of miscues on display, 
Smith showed promise with a 
team-high six digs.
“We’re going to be a good first 
contact team,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “What I don’t 
want people to think and what I 
don’t want our players to think is 
that we’re not good at it. I actually 
think we’re a good first-contact 
team — we’re just not a super 
experienced first contact team.”
In the nightcap, ball control 
became more of a worry for 
Michigan. After cruising to a 
first set victory, 
the 
passing 
unraveled a bit 
in 
the 
second 
and third sets, 
forcing Welsh to 
set the ball to the 
Lumberjacks’ 
stationary 
double 
block 
on the outside. 
When the dust 
settled, 
the 
Wolverines dropped a pair of 
sets in their second match of the 
season, while it took 11 matches 
for them to drop a single frame a 
season ago.
Northern 
Arizona, 
which 
upset then-No. 8 Florida in a 
five-set thriller last September, 
pushed Michigan to the brink 
after a lackluster first frame. 
The Lumberjacks kept the match 

close by playing fundamental 
volleyball — they committed 
13 fewer attack errors, ran a 
simpler offense and out-blocked 
the hosts by three. Part of the 
Wolverines’ struggle was self-
inflicted, namely the negative 
hitting percentage that left them 
on the wrong side of a third-set 
drubbing.
Rosen tinkered with his lineup 
at that point, subbing in senior 
opposite 
Katarina 
Glavinic 
for senior middle blocker Cori 
Crocker and rotating Pertofsky 
to 
the 
middle. 
The 
move 
gave Michigan the injection 
it 
desperately 
needed, 
with 
Glavinic tallying five kills on 
eight errorless swings.
“Our offense was really stale,” 
Rosen said. “We weren’t scoring 
as we needed to. We felt like we 
needed to score more on that pin. 
(Glavinic) is more of a straight-
up right side, and so we went 
away from the three-middle 
system and went to that. I think 
it changed the match in terms of 
the way (Glavinic) executed.”
But when push came to shove, 
it was Welsh’s four-point service 
run that ignited the final spurt. 
The Wolverines’ court captain 
transformed a two-point deficit 
into a two-point lead, giving 
Michigan 
the 
advantage 
it 
needed to stave off the opening 
night upset bid.

Michigan coach Mark Rosen said he wants the Wolverines to be a good first-contact team as opposed to just ball control.

Danna making the most of dream, now a reality

It was a gamble, and Mike 
Danna knew it.
All things considered, Danna 
had it good. In three seasons 
at Central Michigan, he tallied 
27.5 tackles for loss and 15 sacks. 
Nearly half of each came in his 
junior season in 2018, a year 
which ballooned his national 
profile. 
Pro Football Focus graded 
him as the nation’s 22nd-best 
player in its preseason top 50 
rankings — noting his 24.3 
percent success rate on pass 
rushes in 2018 as the second-
highest in the country.
All of this is to say Mike 
Danna 
did 
not 
need 
the 
Michigan brand to get noticed. 
He could have stayed at Central 
Michigan and flourished in a 
senior season. He could have 
entered the NFL Draft, and 
he considered that possibility. 
Picking 
up 
your 
life 
and 
dropping elsewhere is not easy 
for anyone at any time.
But when Michigan came 
calling, he knew in his heart 
what he wanted.
“Michigan’s always been a 
dream of mine,” Danna said 
Tuesday evening. “It was always 
a dream of mine. My whole 
childhood, me and my father 
always 
watched 
Michigan 
games. Getting that offer was 
kind of just like — as soon as 
I got that offer, I was like ‘I’m 
coming to Michigan.’ ”
That 
decision 
was 
made 
easier by his familiarity with 
the program. Danna, a native 
of Warren, grew up knowing 
several of Michigan’s current 
and former players, including 
senior 
cornerback 
Lavert 
Hill, 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
and 
redshirt junior running back 
Tru Wilson. Though Sherrone 
Moore 
never 
coached 
him 
directly, the two share ties 
from their overlapping time at 
Central Michigan.

Still, this was far from a 
slam-dunk.
“I knew it was for sure a 
gamble,” he said. “I know the 
work that I put in. I know that 
you get what you put in, so if you 
put in a lot of work, something 
good is going to come out of 
it. There’s always good things 
that happen to good people. I 
put in a lot of work throughout 
the summer. I knew what I 
was getting myself into, and I 
gambled on myself because I 
knew at the end of the day, like, 
I can do it.”
Danna’s 
career 
path 
has 
followed a familiar narrative. 
He was a three-star recruit, 
the 46th-ranked player in the 
state, according to 247Sports 
composite ranking. The big 
schools, namely Michigan and 
Michigan State, didn’t come 
calling initially. He went to play 
for the Chippewas and steadily 
developed into an elite pass 
rusher. 
Thus far, the transition to 
Michigan has been relatively 
seamless. He knew he was 
entering a defensive line room 
perennially stocked with talent, 

but the coaching staff instantly 
heaped praise.
“We 
knew 
Mike 
was 
good, but he’s doing better 
than advertised so far,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
last month on his Attack Each 
Day podcast. “His work ethic 
has 
been 
outstanding, 
and 
he’s on a mission to make both 
himself and Michigan great.”
He’s done nothing yet to deter 
the notion that he can. Though 
sophomore 
Aidan 
Hutchinson 
and 
junior 
Kwity 
Paye 
technically 
started 
at 
defensive 
end 
last 
Saturday 
against Middle 
Tennessee 
State, 
Danna 
featured 
heavily in the rotation. He 
notched a couple pressures 
and showed glimpses of his 
athletic 
ability, 
particularly 
in the increasingly-prevalent 
NASCAR pass rush looks that 
feature four defensive ends.

He’s no longer the man atop 
the depth chart, nor opposing 
teams’ scouting reports. He’s 
going to have opportunities, and 
he knows he’ll have to take full 
advantage of them. There’s an 
inherent discomfort with a new, 
more challenging environment. 
From big fish in a small pond to 
minnow in a great lake.
But it’s all worth it when he 
sees his parents in the Big House 
stands on Saturdays, when he 
gets to touch the 
banner, live out 
his 
childhood 
memories 
and 
realize, 
finally, 
his dream is now 
a reality.
“Every 
day 
I live with the 
mindset 
that, 
‘You play for the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
this 
is your dream.’ But at the same 
time, I don’t take no days off,” 
Danna said. “I look myself in 
the mirror and tell myself, ‘If 
you’re going to be this big guy 
on the field, you’ve got to live 
up to it.”

Notebook: Onwenu, 
kickers, injury updates

Last 
season, 
Michigan’s 
offense huddled before every 
play, taking its good sweet time 
to get in formation. But under 
new offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis, that’s changed.
And with a new no-huddle 
system designed to push the 
tempo, senior guard Michael 
Onwenu knew he needed to get 
into better shape. So he changed 
his daily habits in the offseason 
to become healthier while still 
maintaining the bulk that gives 
him push on the offensive line.
Now, as he put it, he’s able 
to “hold up and 
stay 
alive” 
at 
the game’s new 
speed.
“Just 
eating 
and 
sleeping,” 
Onwenu 
said. 
“Sleeping is the 
most, as a college 
student it’s like, 
take sleep for 
granted and you 
just want to stay 
up and play the game instead of 
take that more serious.”
Because of practice schedules 
and media obligations, Onwenu 
is required to schedule most 
of his classes in the morning, 
sometimes as early as 8 a.m. Last 
year, he might have gone to bed 
around midnight. Now, he tries 
to be asleep by 10 p.m., getting 
9-10 hours many nights where 
before he may have only gotten 
six or seven.
“You have to be mature about 
it,” Onwenu said. “You know you 
have stuff to do tomorrow.”
Hayes on converting from 
tight end
While Onwenu was slimming 
down, redshirt freshman tackle 
Ryan Hayes was bulking up.
A tight end in high school, 
Hayes came in around 245 
pounds. But he knew he’d have a 
tall task in front of him. He was 
recruited as a tackle/tight end, 
essentially told that it was likely 
he would convert when he joined 
the Wolverines — though he had 
never played the position until 
he got on campus. He expected a 
challenge, but bulking up wasn’t 
as hard as he’d thought at first.
Though 
Hayes 
still 
gets 
ribbed by some of the other 
linemen 
as 
“the 
skinniest 
lineman,” Hayes is now up to 
295, around 20 pounds below his 
target weight. And clearly, the 
conversion from tight end has 
been somewhat smooth, given 
that Hayes was nails all game in 
his first ever start at left tackle 
Saturday, even earning offensive 
player of the week honors from 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
Harbaugh went so far as to 
mention that Hayes could be in 
the mix to start at right tackle in 
the future.
“The 
tough 
part 
was 
physically because I was still 
weighing about — once we got 
to the season I 
was about 260,” 
Hayes said. “So 
playing 
tackle 
here 
against 
some of the best 
D-linemen was 
hard. 
… 
And 
just getting the 
new 
footwork 
down 
because 
playing 
tight 
end has nothing 
to do with pass-setting and just 
nothing to do with that, so I had 
to get bigger, stronger, get the 
footwork down.”
Offensive 
line 
coach 
Ed 
Warinner has pushed Hayes, 
letting him know that the fact 
he hadn’t played the position 
before isn’t an excuse to mess 
up. It was a lesson Hayes said 
he needed to learn, and now it’s 

paying off.
The kicker question has an 
answer — or not
Harbaugh 
and 
the 
other 
coaches stayed mum about the 
results of the kicker competition 
between redshirt junior Quinn 
Nordin and sophomore Jake 
Moody all throughout spring 
and fall camps, but there was a 
sense that whoever trotted out 
for the Wolverines’ first kick 
of the game Saturday would 
announce himself as the winner.
Not so fast.
When Michigan kicked a field 
goal early in the first quarter, it 
was Moody that came out. But 
when it scored a touchdown not 
long after and 
needed an extra 
point, 
Nordin 
came on.
In the end, 
Moody 
went 
2-for-2 on field 
goals 
— 
one 
from 27 and one 
from 34 — and 
handled seven of 
the team’s eight 
kickoffs. Nordin 
was 4-for-4 on extra points.
Instead 
of 
clarity 
about 
the battle, there was more 
confusion. 
But 
on 
Monday, 
Harbaugh explained himself.
The 
two 
kickers, 
he 
explained, had been “one kick 
apart” throughout camp. Moody 
was one kick ahead, so he was 
assigned the first field goal. 
From then on, one would be 
assigned the next field goal and 
the other the next point attempt. 
But three extra points in a row 
equaled a field goal, giving the 
other kicker a go. That’s exactly 
what happened when Nordin 
hit three extra points before the 
Wolverines attempted another 
field goal, which Moody took.
Harbaugh believes the plan 
will remain the same going 
forward as long as nothing goes 
awry in practice.
“I know that sounds kind of 
confusing but it actually cleared 
it up,” Harbaugh said. “So we 
actually, we knew exactly what 
kicker would be kicking on each 
drive so we wouldn’t have two 
kickers running out there and 
two kickers warming up on the 
net.”
Injury updates
On Saturday, junior wide 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones 
did not dress and wore a walking 
boot. Junior defensive lineman 
Donovan 
Jeter 
also 
wasn’t 
dressed. Fifth-year senior tackle 
Jon Runyan dressed, but did 
not play, and senior defensive 
lineman 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
wore a club on his hand and left 
the game after two drives with 
an injury.
The injuries — none of which 
were disclosed beforehand — 
caused Michigan to have to 
scramble for players ahead of 
the Middle Tennessee game. By 
the sound of things, this week 
will be a lot of wait and see.
In his press 
conference 
Monday, 
Harbaugh 
said 
Peoples-Jones, 
Runyan 
and 
Jeter all had a 
chance to play, 
and “we’ll see” 
on Dwumfour.
It 
was 
Runyan’s 
injury that gave 
Hayes his chance to step into 
the spotlight against the Blue 
Raiders, so naturally, when 
Hayes addressed the media 
Tuesday, he was asked if he was 
preparing to start again against 
Army. The implication: Will 
Runyan be back?
“Time will tell,” Hayes said. 
“I’m not going to prepare as a 
starter. We’ll see what happens.”

I actually think 
we’re a good 
first contact 
team.

The scores

DAY ONE
The ever-present Arctic wind bearing 
down on your crumbling, medieval town 
drives people mad. Your hair, once gently 
tousled, turns whip-like, dangerous, once 
the gale from the North Sea hits the St. 
Andrews cliffs, traveling upward, wrap-
ping itself around buildings, pursuing 
you. No coat can thwart the wind’s efforts 
to flush out your warmth. Its familiar 
white noise ranges from a whisper outside 
a windowpane to a bloodcurdling shriek, 
closing in from all sides. When people fall 
from the cliffs, it’s always the wind’s fault. 
The wind urges you to get too close — to 
peer down at the receding tide. It either 
pushes you or taunts you until you find 
yourself on the rocks below.
You hope that isn’t what happened to 
Fraser, but it’s too soon to know. Police 
haven’t found him yet. You’re still cooped 
up in your dormitory, St. Salvatore’s, 
in the main dining hall, awaiting news. 
Refreshing your group chat every five 
seconds to make sure you don’t miss the 
announcement. You curl over on the 
creaking oak bench as if you’re praying to 
the screen.
At the end of your bench, a couple 
of girls are murmuring, holding fast to 
steaming mugs of tea. You try not to lis-
ten to the girls. Their theories are too 
grotesque for so early in a missing per-
son’s case. Instead, you turn your atten-
tion to the window next to you — an 
imitation stained-glass portrait of some 
saint or other, painted hundreds of years 
ago, stolen from an older cathedral and 
added unceremoniously to a glorified caf-
eteria. The paint mostly looks like murky 
browns — dried blood — instead of the full 
spectrum of color it probably originally 
had. You suppress the urge to scrape it off 
with your short, wide fingernails.
The information you’ve been given so 
far is sparse: Fraser went out last night 
to the only nightclub in town. The sur-
veillance system spotted him walking 
towards the Old Course at 11:30 p.m., his 
phone pressed to his ear. He didn’t return 
to his residence hall last night. The uni-
versity pronounced Fraser missing this 
morning.
It’s just local police who’re crawl-
ing through the town, the marshes, the 
beaches. All morning you’d been dialing 

Fraser’s number to no avail, gnawing on 
your torn cuticles with every unanswered 
ring. It’s nearly evening now, and you’ve 
stopped calling.

DAY FOUR
Your residence hall’s Facebook page 
is promoting a community-based search 
in collaboration with the local police 
in their chartreuse vests. One hundred 
other St. Andrews’s residents have indi-
cated they’re joining. The cell phone 
looks accusingly at you, in bed, scroll-
ing through social media. Callum’s and 
Euan’s names pop up first on the list of 
searchers. Seeing the faint outlines of 
your face reflected in the blue light of the 
screen and feeling like a fraud, you click 
the “Going” button at the top of the page. 
Your stomach turns, and your mind cal-
culates the space between you and the 
nearest toilet, though you haven’t eaten 
all morning.
You twist your body underneath your 
two goose down comforters. The wind 
passes right through St. Salvatore’s, which 
was built in the 1930s, but shows no indi-
cation of repair work or renovations in the 
eight decades since. The window panes 
at the head of your and your roommate’s 
twin beds rattle with the Arctic gales, a 
sound you still haven’t grown accustomed 
to. When it wakes you up at night, your 
first thoughts, drunk with sleep, are that 
masked robbers are banging on the glass, 
trying to break into the room.
Your prick of a roommate isn’t here, 
though. Euan, the first-year star of the 
University’s rugby team, rarely is. The 
students, both boys and girls, but mostly 
the American girls, oddly enough, can’t 
get enough of Euan. You routinely dismiss 
his inexplicably tanned, broad-shoul-
dered confidence as a kind of dickishness, 
but somewhere you know he isn’t that 
awful. He’s just smug about getting girls. 
Unfortunately, and rather comically, you 
have the opposite luck. The only time a 
girl appears interested in you is when 
you mention Euan is your roommate. 
More often than not, you get addressed 
by strangers around campus as Jamie, 
Euan’s roommate. Your claim to fame.
The search party’s scheduled to meet at 
noon outside the nightclub/coffee house/
student organization facilities that com-

pose the St. Andrews Union. You shift to 
look at the school-issued clock on your 
bedside table. It’s 11:00 a.m.
Callum is already out by the Union 
when you arrive, clutching a large black 
coffee and shivering. He reminds you of 
a willow — sinewy, tall, and in constant 
motion. His eyes dart from person to per-
son in the crowd, no doubt feeling anxious 
at the thought of being unsociable. You 
decide not to startle him this time.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Jamie. I thought 
you weren’t coming,” Callum says when 
he catches sight of you, his black hair and 
dark eyes severe against the pallor of his 
skin.
“Right, well, this is important,” you 
reply, eyes downturned and voice low.
“Are you hungover, mate?” Callum asks 
you, a smile tugging at his lips.
“Not even close, you wank stain.”
You try to stand a little straighter, 
unfurrowing your brow, worried that you 
look disheveled in your Barbour jacket 
and sweatpants. Callum’s height and 
angular limbs only magnify your slight 
baby fat, how you’re only taller than the 
short girls in your classes.
You hear Euan’s booming voice some-
where to your left, comforting one of the 
pretty field hockey girls who’s crying soft-
ly. Despite the tears, she still looks beau-
tiful with her long blonde hair and full 
lips. His arm around her, Euan’s pulled 
her close, as if he’s protecting her. Several 
other girls in the crowd eye her greedily.
“Isn’t that Anna?” Callum asks, gestur-
ing towards Euan and the girl.
“What?” you pretend to just now see 
her. “Oh, yeah. It is.”
Callum raises his eyebrows at you, but 
you look away, trying to appear unboth-
ered.
“This isn’t about Anna.” 

DAY ELEVEN
The search party ended with mud and 
sand and salt from the North Sea caked 
all over everybody’s shoes. Your favorite 
green wellies kept getting lodged in the 
marshy wasteland. After falling twice, 
you’ve still got a yellowed bruise over your 
ribcage.
Night descended quickly, it being mid-
March. Dusk was gathering its fragments 
of light long before dinnertime, and the 

search party was forced to retreat into 
the dark wooden sanctuaries of pubs. Not 
even the moon brought any relief from 
the impenetrable dark. You’re so far up 
the coast it’s possible for the Northern 
Lights to touch your ruined citadel of a 
town, briefly, before disappearing behind 
the heavy clouds of Scotland for months. 
You’ve never seen them, but you know 
some nights they’re up there, dancing 
above the claustrophobic sky.
Scotland Yard quickly stepped in and 
took over the investigation after the 
unsuccessful search. The citizens of St. 
Andrews apparently hindering the efforts 
of the professionals, they were asked to 
stop organizing. The day after Fraser’s 
disappearance, construction crews ini-
tiated their scheduled excavation of the 
centuries-old leaky storm drains. Today 
Scotland Yard’s ordering the crews to dig 
up the old drains, freshly-filled with con-
crete, on the possibility that Fraser might 
have drunkenly fallen into one of them. 
You know if that’s true, he would’ve been 
buried alive. You try not to think about 
that. 
You’ve plunked yourself down in the 
alleged site of Will and Kate’s first date, 
a coffee shop-turned-reliquary dedicated 
to the budding romance of the two roy-
als. A sun-bleached poster in the window 
boasts their smiling faces, a cartoonish 
red heart drawn between them. It’s now 
become a sort of campy pilgrimage site 
for obnoxious royal superfans, but the 
tea’s still cheap and decent, so you haven’t 
written the place off entirely. Mindlessly, 
you scroll through Fraser’s old Instagram 
posts and neglect your too-hot black tea. 
“Miss u,” “hope you’re safe,” and “come 
home” litter the comment sections below 
each picture.
You pause at the picture from the St. 
Andrews Charity Fashion Show show 
last month. Fraser and Euan, along with 
a host of other good-looking students, 
served as models for the annual event. 
Both Callum and you bought the over-
priced tickets to ogle at and mock the dis-
play of extravagance: the designer gowns, 
the expensive champagne, the exclusive 
seats by the runway selling for upwards of 
300 quid. In reality, though, you suspect 
you just wanted to see Fraser up close. It 
didn’t hurt that he was shirtless for the

majority of the evening.
Before that night, you’d never con-
sidered yourself anything other than 
straight. Sure, you could recognize when 
other guys were objectively attractive, but 
your main preoccupation was girls. Spe-
cifically, you dwelled on your inability 
to hook up with them, but the focus was 
girls, nonetheless. As you got drunk that 
night on cheap Scotch from a flask tucked 
into your tuxedo, your eyes sought Fra-
ser more frequently than any other model 
in the show. His gaze caught yours once 
while he was doing the final walk with the 
entire brigade of designers, models and 
event coordinators. His dark red hair and 
blue eyes were both dangerous and invit-
ing, a dare you weren’t sure you could fol-
low through on.
That night was the first and last time 
you kissed him. It was half a joke, and half 
serious, as his girlfriend Anna was egging 
him on to lean in and do it after another 
round of tequila shots at the Union bar’s 
after-party. You’d managed to strike up 
an alcohol-fueled conversation with him 
after Callum decided he’d had enough of 
the “posh bastards” and headed back to 
his dorm.
Fraser, his eyes half-closed, and his 
shirt half-unbuttoned and inexplica-
bly damp, slung his arm around you and 
declared you his new best friend. He 
grabbed your phone and put his number 
in it.
The first time you called that number 
was the day of his disappearance.

DAY THIRTEEN
It’s five in the morning, and you’ve 

woken up with a racing heart and a cold 
sweat, concentrated around your knees 
and torso. Euan’s hulking silhouette 
shifts in the bed across from yours, his 
breath even and mind apparently bliss-
fully unconscious. Your sweat clinging to 
your skin in small beads, you sit up, wip-
ing the moisture from your body with a 
dry section of your sheets.
You dreamed Fraser was back, only you 
were the only one to know he’d returned. 
He led you to the pier by the crumbling 
cathedral and kissed you again, this 
time slowly, not at all joking or making a 
show of it. The reflection of the Northern 
Lights played on the surface of the ocean, 
calmer than you’d ever seen it before. 
Only, when you drew back to look at Fra-
ser, he’d vanished, and you were alone 
again in the dark.
Fighting the raging wind, you leave 
the walled enclosure of St. Salvatore’s 
and walk down The Scores, the narrow 
lane separating the town’s cliffs from the 
shores of the North Sea. The water’s so icy 
there’s no classic ocean breeze, no salty 
brine, only the scent of that damned wind, 
roaring down on the exposed, chapped 
skin of your face.
The sun won’t come up for another 
couple hours, but the sky is clear, a half-
moon shedding light on the earth, turning 
everything a barely-visible midnight blue. 
You take the road as far as it will go, end-
ing at the Old Course on the outskirts of 
town.
You hoist your legs over the thick metal 
fence that encloses the world’s first golf 
course. Spongy and soft, the grass is 
shorn down to millimeters here. Undu-

lating mounds and dips in the earth make 
you believe, briefly, that you’re on the 
surface of another planet. The wind picks 
up here, uninterrupted by cliffs or by old 
stone buildings.
When you reach West Sands, you gag 
on the air. It smells like brackish water 
and death. The beach stretches out for 
hundreds of meters — your shoes scarcely 
make an imprint in the flat, kelp-ridden, 
dense sand. It still feels unearthly here, 
and you begin to think this is what the 
surface of the moon must be like.
The tide’s out, and, close to the retreat-
ing waves you spot a black, boundless 
mound, backlit by the moonlight. You run 
to it.
“Fraser!” you scream. “Fraser, is that 
you?”
The closer you get, the larger the 
mound looms. You stop short of the fig-
ure before you, still and silent on the 
sand. Hands trembling, you pull out your 
phone, switching on the flashlight. You 
point it at the mystery heap. Your brain 
doesn’t register what you’re seeing for 
several seconds.
Horizontal whitish ridges elongate the 
creature. You’re looking at a belly, bloated 
and half your height. The skin turns dark 
grey when you move the light up, scanning 
the outline of whatever this is. When you 
find the mouth, massive bristles line the 
top jaw.
It’s a dead minke whale, and, from the 
smell of it, it isn’t a fresh one. A tongue, 
massive and pink, lies on the sand fall-
ing from the whale’s gaping mouth. The 
tongue’s as large as your leg.
Horror floods your throat, and you 

retch on the beach, steps from the corpse.

DAY THIRTY-EIGHT
A local found Fraser this morning. 
Parallel to the pier, the tide of East Sands 
washed up his remains on the jagged 
rocks, where they were sniffed out by a 
curious dog. Preliminary reports are say-
ing it was an accidental drowning, ruling 
out foul play and suicide.
You head to the pier, that formidable 
jutting structure, stretching its arms to 
greet the water, a sheer drop down to slick 
rocks and hidden currents if the gusts 
hurl you over. No one else is out here, cau-
tious against a festering spring storm and 
discouraged by the police who’d already 
transported the body elsewhere. At the 
end of the pier, sky and sea merge into one 
long grey haze, and each bellows out its 
protests, beating its own chest.
You collapse at the pier’s edge, your 
mind returning to your dream, when Fra-
ser held your face and kissed you in this 
very location. You knew you’d loved him 
then, and the loss claws at your chest. 
A white wave, brimming with greyish-
brown foam, kisses your fingertips, still 
clamped to the slick slabs of stone.
You look to the West Sands, the sprawl-
ing expanse of cold beach. You recall the 
whale that washed up there, some weeks 
ago, bloated and slick with decomposi-
tion. Students were warned not to go close 
to the corpse; it was going to explode. Its 
eyes had been pecked out by the gulls. 
Hours ago, it was Fraser who was discov-
ered, pale and swollen, on the rocks. You 
wonder whether his eyes were gone too.

I

’ve always been told I’m an extrovert. Funny how 
you can be told something but not believe it yourself.
Typically, we think extroverts to be energized 
by social interactions to the point where they crave it 
constantly. And I do think this of myself. I love the feeling 
of being surrounded by friends, the room buzzing. Because 
of this expectation to fulfill the role of the extrovert, to be 
“on” 24/7, my perception of being isolated has been warped.
This summer, I spent many hours baking in the 
living room of my apartment in Hamtramck without 
air conditioning. It was just me, my guitar and the oddly 
specific poker decor leftover from the previous tenant. I 
started to go crazy, finding any opportunity I could to be 
around people, often standing in the corner at concerts 
where I knew no one. 
I quickly learned that just because I was “going out” 
didn’t mean I was outgoing. I felt ashamed that I wasn’t 
living up to my societally-ordained title of Extrovert with 
a capital E.
When I read Olivia Laing’s “The Lonely City,” 
everything clicked. Her part-memoir, part-art history 
lesson examining what it means to be lonely surrounded 
by people opened a part of me I never knew existed. We 
as humans want to combat loneliness because of how it’s 
stigmatized: Lonely people aren’t getting out enough; 
Lonely people are longing for someone to talk to them; 
Lonely people are just plain sad.
I finished this book at a back-alley restaurant in Pristina, 
Kosovo. No one was sitting near me. In that post-finishing-
a-book glow, I realized valuing myself by how many people 
I know doesn’t hold a candle to valuing myself by how well 
I know me.

his summer I learned to love silence. 
Coming from New Jersey, you could definitely 
say I have a large and quite talkative personality. 
My calm summer days used to consist of the crashing 
waves on the Jersey Shore. However, I spent the summer 
in Burlington, Vermont, surrounded by beautiful lakes, 
mountains and a quiet peacefulness. I liked the views and 
the countless Instagram opportunities, but I truly loved 
the way that setting changed me. 
Hiking on mountains alone with the sounds of nature 
became my safe place to just be me. Lake Champlain 
looked the same in person as it did on a postcard, reading 
my book as I watched the sunset over my picturesque new 
home. The silence was so present that it was loud enough 
to drown out my own thoughts — the type of mental reset 
everyone needs from time to time. 
Over my summer, those peaceful moments were the 
times I stopped to embrace and appreciate the here and 
now. I became a kinder person to myself, my peers and the 
earth. I became a better listener to myself and my friends. 
It’s like at first, the silence of Vermont helped me to clear 
my mind. By the end, that same silence was what organized 
my mind. 
As my summer in Vermont came to a close, I realized 
my newfound love for peaceful quiet did not have to leave 
when I did. Silence was not my Saturday hikes or a gentle 
lake. Silence was the clear mindset I could push myself to 
seek out and maintain, even in the hustle and bustle of Ann 
Arbor.

ating disorder recovery: a love story
I’ve been asking myself lately if I’m ready 
to start writing again. I can’t tell you how 
many times I’ve opened the same notebook and 
stared at the same blank page, daring myself to just 
write. Not for a grade, not for an audience, just for 
myself. I just couldn’t do it this summer. 
The few pages of writing I have from the last few 
months are jumbled and incomplete. Cursive turns 
to scribbles and lines and dark circles of ink where 
I let the pen bleed. So much has been torn up and 
thrown away. Most of it was never written.
This isn’t a love story about writing, but it is a love 
story about truth. This summer I learned how to tell 
the truth. I learned what it means to be honest in 
ways I hadn’t known were possible. I learned how to 
vocalize what I’d known for a long time. I was always 
lying through my teeth: to my parents, to my friends, 
to my doctors, to myself. I didn’t want to be sick or 
a burden. I didn’t want to be harming myself, and I 
certainly didn’t want to be attention-seeking. But I’d 
been staring at blank pages for so long that I didn’t 
think I could do it anymore. Honestly, I could have, 
but it made for a better love story to somehow admit 
the truth.
If you have no idea what I’m talking about, that’s 
OK. If you do, maybe you’ll know how hard it is to 
recover. Maybe you know how broken you feel 
looking in the mirror. How much strength it takes to 

turn down one more drink or to just eat the burger. 
But even beyond the constraints of an eating 
disorder, maybe you know how much the truth can 
burn on its way out. It is so hard not to end every 
conversation with “I don’t know.” It is hard to love 
people. It is hard to mend mistakes you’ve made over 
and over, and it breaks me to admit I’m scared. 
The truth is, I’m healing. I’m learning how to 
write again. 
I’m also stronger than I used to be — less fragile. 
I’m more whole. I’m getting to know myself again, 
and I’m trying to find the right words to say that.

I 

fall in love three times a day. Perhaps 
it’s because I’m a cancer sun and a 
cancer moon; perhaps it’s because I’m 
a writer. Perhaps it’s because I exclusively 
seek out experiences that make my heart 
race (in a good way). But with everything 
I’ve fallen blindly head over heels for in 21 
years –– boys in glasses, coffee shops that 
sell newspapers, banana muffins, redheaded 
best friends, novels dripping in rich prose 
(set in Paris), I’ve never quite made the list 
of the places, ideas and people my heart 
aches for. Perhaps, this is because I am a 
member of a generation that monitors self-
worth based on our social media accounts. 
Or perhaps it is because I put pressure on 
myself that steals my ability to triumph in 
who I am. 
Ever since I was a child, I’ve wanted to 
move to New York City. New York’s biggest 
delight for me lies in its impassioned vigor 
for live theatre. Working on Broadway in 
the city of my eight-year-old daydreams this 
summer didn’t live up to the expectations 
I always held tight in the back of my mind. 
Simultaneously, the experience of living 
in the middle of all I’ve hoped for pushed 
me to fall in love yet again, not with the 
city, but myself. I recognized the reality of 
New York beneath the sparkle. It’s a place 
not of idealism and magic but nitty, gritty 
life — real life. Being out of the bubble of 
my childhood pushed me to look at what 
New York truly is: a bubbly, wide awake, 
disgusting paradise. The things that make 
New York ugly make New York real, and 
the things that make New York real make 
it beautiful. After 21 years of self-doubt over 
insignificant flaws — pinching extra skin on 
my sides, scrutinizing every word I put on a 
page, agonizing over relationships — I can 
exhale a bit. I am young, I am in the middle 
of it all and the very things that make me real 
are the things that make me beautiful.

fter saying goodbye to my family 
and schlepping my two heavy 
suitcases onto the New York-
bound train, the first thing I did was pull 
up Instagram on my phone. On my story, 
I posted a picture of the train I had just 
boarded with the caption “NYC bound for 
the summer! If you’re in the city and wanna 
be my friend and go on adventures hmu!”. 
Two hours passed and only three people 
responded: my girlfriend, 500 miles away 
and another friend, 2,700 miles away, both 
to wish me luck.
The first day of my internship a few 
days later I hoped to make friends with 
some of the other interns, and I succeeded 
with one or two out of 40. I reached out 
to several people who I knew would be 
in the city and built up a decent network, 
but there were still many days I didn’t 
have anyone to hang out with and still had 
things I wanted to do. So, I decided to do 
them by myself. My summer love story is 
to solitude and these photos dive deep into 
the city that I loved to explore by myself.

from the

E

very year in early August, our 
mother would haul my siblings 
and me into our car in the 
stifling heat. The four of us would wait 
for hours in long lines at the international 
bridge, waiting to cross the border from 
Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua into El Paso.
We lived on the Mexican side of our 
sprawling binational metropolitan area 
and crossed often for groceries and 
shopping, so this was a standard routine 
for us. When our turn finally came, we 
would roll down the windows and sit up 
straight, knowing better than to speak 
out of turn.
“American,” my brother, sister and 
I would say to the border agent, as our 
Mexican mother put her green passport 
next to our blue ones.
We would spend all day hopping from 
store to store, buying No. 2 pencils, tennis 
shoes, new backpacks and pencil cases. 
Our last stop was always the Walmart 
in the Cielo Vista Mall. There, our mom 
would go through her usual weekly 
grocery list, sometimes even agreeing to 
buy us the candy bars we picked at the 
register.
I always knew my blue passport 
granted 
me 
something 
special, 
something everyone else wanted, but not 
all were allowed to possess. My parents 
encouraged me to be proud, to be grateful, 
to take advantage of the opportunities I 
got. And I was.
I felt special. My blue passport allowed 
me to move north when the situation in 
Juarez deteriorated, and granted me 
access to public education. It erased the 
border for me and allowed me to aspire 
to be more.
But now, I am not so sure. The word 
“American” doesn’t feel so safe anymore. 
It doesn’t feel mine.
My family and I aren’t strangers 
to racially charged comments and 
discrimination. Since our move to 
southwest Michigan in 2011, we have 
been told to go back to where we came 
from, asked if we ride donkeys to school, 
given mustard when we asked for coffee 
in a drive thru when a worker claimed 
not to understand my father’s accent, 
even been laughed at for the way we say 
“kitchen” or “jaguar.”
From the beginning, we understood 
that our differences were not completely 
welcome in the place we were to call 
home, and we strove to be included, to 
respect our neighbors and to learn how 
to do things their way.
It wasn’t until a few years ago that 
I started feeling unsure when calling 
myself an American.
I can recall the specific moment on 
television, when their candidate Donald 
Trump claimed Mexico was sending 

“their worst.” Claiming Mexicans were 
criminals, rapists and “bringing drugs” 
was incorrect, but extremely successful.
He got what he wanted.
Hearing those words come out of 
Trump’s mouth as if they were facts 
validated stereotypes about my people. 
There was no distinction. In Trump’s 
words, all Mexicans and Mexican-
Americans, even me and my family, 
were Mexico’s worst.
This particular Latinx stereotype 
was alive and thriving in 2015, and it 
has since grown into full-blown acts 
of hate and violence. What happened 
at the Cielo Vista Walmart of my 
childhood at the beginning of 
August can only be labeled as 
such, an act of hate by a person 
who 
believes 
the 
Latinx 
community is a threat to 
European Americans. 
The word “American” 
slips further and further 
from our reach every 
time someone commits 
a 
crime 
denouncing 
the Latinx community, 
casting us as others in 
a country that would 
not exist without our 
presence and dedication.
Latinx 
people, 
Mexicans in particular, 
populated 
areas 
in 
the Southwest of our 
country before European 
Americans even thought 
of them as viable places 
to live. Those lands in 
New Mexico, California, 
Colorado, Arizona and, 
yes, Texas were cultivated 
and developed by us before 
they became part of the 
United States.
The 
decision 
between 
calling myself Mexican or 
American is not one I should 
have to make.
I am both. I have full rights 
to enjoy all of what this country 
has to offer. I am not stealing 
anything away from “Americans” 
because I am one. 
At this moment, people like 
me, Mexicans and Latinx, are 
being labeled as invaders, and that 
contradicts everything my parents 
told me about the special qualities 
of my blue passport.

Press. You can find it on the
