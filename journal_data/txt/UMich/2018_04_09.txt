The 
leadership 
of 
the 

Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization has postponed a 
walkout planned for Monday and 
Tuesday after the University of 
Michigan bargaining team began 
to “move in the right direction” 
at 
a 
last 
ditch 
bargaining 

session Sunday morning, LEO 
announced in a tweet Sunday 
night.

The eight-member LEO Union 

Council decided to call off the job 
action after reviewing bargaining 
progress and consulting with the 
union bargaining team.

According to LEO President 

Ian Robinson, more than 2,000 

people, including students, had 
signed up for picket shifts in the 
event that the union called for 
members to strike.

Robinson said Friday that even 

if the University did not fully 
meet LEO’s demands, if they 
presented offers that showed 
progress, union leadership would 
continue negotiating.

“If they don’t come to table 

with an adequate offer but it 
shows enough progress that 
we can call off the strike in 
good faith, we would call of the 
strike and continue bargaining,” 
Robinson said.

Sexual Assault Prevention 

and Awareness Center held its 
fifth annual Yes Means Fest on 
the Diag Sunday afternoon to 
raise awareness of bystander 
intervention and consent. The 
event was organized by SAPAC’s 
Bystander 
Intervention 
and 

Community 
Engagement 

volunteer program.

The 
event 
inspired 

conversations 
surrounding 

the problem of sexual violence 
on 
campus, 
and 
featured 

several 
student 
groups, 

musicians and artists in a series 
of 
performances. 
Proceeds 

from the event went toward 
SafeHouse 
Center, 
which 

supports people impacted by 
sexual 
assault 
or 
domestic 

violence.

LSA seniors Julia Berg and 

Bonnie Cheng, who served as 
co-coordinators of the BICE 
program, 
spoke 
about 
the 

event’s focus on the intersection 
of 
consent 
and 
bystander 

intervention. 

“April 
is 
Sexual 
Assault 

Awareness 
Month 
and 

we’ve 
already 
had 
SAPAC 

on 
the 
Diag, 
which 
was 

organized 
by 
(Consent, 

Outreach 
and 
Relationship 

Engagement) and was very 
primary prevention oriented,” 
Berg said. “We wanted to make 
sure that this was very distinct 
and 
more 
geared 
towards 

secondary 
prevention 
and 

bystander intervention.”

Yes Means Fest featured 

several student groups including 
Wolverine Support Network, 
Students for Choice, HeForShe, 
Expect Respect, SafeHouse and 
the Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution. 

Berg spoke further about 

how the event served as a way 
for student groups to raise 

awareness on the importance 
of bystander proactiveness and 
showcase how their specific 
organization could help people 
resolve related issues.

“In years past it’s been held 

in the Trotter Multicultural 
Center, but we really wanted 
to bring it to the Diag to just 
make it a bigger event that’s 
more accessible to people,” Berg 
said. “We wanted to bring out 

the 
community 
engagement 

aspect of BICE, so we wanted to 
partner with all these orgs and 
work with them.”

Cheng said holding the event 

on the Diag also allowed them 
to expand the range of people 
hearing their message.

Visual 
and 
written 
art 

expressions created by about 
45 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students 
and 
faculty 
were 

displayed in Rackham Graduate 
School Friday evening for the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 

and Awareness Center’s art 
exhibition 
“rEVOLUTION: 

Making Art for Change.”

The event was founded by 

a former SAPAC volunteer in 
2006 as part of her senior honors 
thesis. Years later, SAPAC’s 
Survivor 
Empowerment 
and 

Ally Support Program continues 
to organize the art show as a 
platform for the University 
community to address issues 
including 
sexual 
violence, 

gender and sexism.

The SEAS Program is one 

of the three volunteer groups 
housed within SAPAC. SEAS 
focuses efforts on educating the 
community on prevention, self-
care and how to be supportive of 
sexual violence survivors.

FRIDAY:

Behind the Story

News

TUESDAY:
By Design 

Participants 
in 
Ann 

Arbor’s 47th annual Hash 
Bash 
found 
themselves 

under the influence of more 
than just cannabis Saturday 
afternoon, 
as 
thousands 

gathered at the University 
of Michigan’s Diag: several 
politicians also found their 
way to the city’s popular 
weed festival, all hoping 
to 
convince 
voters 
they 

were 
biggest 
supporters 

of 
legalizing 
it. 
Many 

participants and organizers 
came hoping this year’s Hash 
Bash will be the last before 
marijuana is legalized in 
the state of Michigan. Many 
believe state Congress will 
approve ballot proposal in 
November to legalize the use 
of recreational marijuana for 
those 21 and older.

Speakers at this year’s 

event included many notable 
marijuana 
legalization 

activists 
and 
professional 

athletes, such as Detroit 
Lions running back Mike 
James, former Detroit Red 
Wings hockey player Darren 
McCarty and former NFL 
player Eugene Monroe. Local 
political figures addressed 
the crowd, including Ann 
Arbor City Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton, 
D-Ward 
4; 

Councilmember 
Anne 

Bannister, D-Ward 1; and state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor. 
State 
politicians 

such 
as 
gubernatorial 

candidates 
Abdul 

El-Sayed 
and 
Gretchen 

Whitmeralso 
made 

appearances.

El-Sayed 
spoke 
on 

his 
support 
to 
legalize 

marijuana, 
stating 
the 

current 
law 
unjustly 

incarcerates youth.

“I’m here as a doctor and 

I’m here as a young servant, 

and I’m here because I’m 
done waiting while young 
people 
get 
arrested 
for 

something that should not 
be illegal,” El-Sayed said, 
according to MLive. “We’ve 
got to stand up and demand 
that we expunge records for 
marijuana possession and use 
… For too long we’ve watched 
as corporations have bought 
and sold our politics.”

Whitmer 
also 
voiced 

support 
for 
marijuana 

legalization, 
comparing 

other 
states’ 
legalization 

reforms and believing “we 
can do it better here in 
Michigan.”

“We are on the cusp of 

legalization in Michigan,” 
Whitmer said, according to 
MLive. “Number one: let’s 
just get it done. Number two: 
let’s regulate it so it doesn’t 
get in the hands of kids 
because I know no one here 
wants that, and let’s make 
sure that we’re taxing it — 
maybe we can get to work 
filling those damn potholes. 
Let’s fix those damn roads.”

LSA 
junior 
Amal 

Alzendani, the U-M campus 
field team leader for the 
El-Sayed campaign, came 
to the Diag to hear the 
candidate speak. 

“It 
was 
great 
to 
see 

Abdul 
El-Sayed 
at 
Hash 

Bash engaging with voters 
to 
whom 
the 
issue 
of 

marijuana 
legalization 
is 

important,” she wrote in an 
email interview. “It seems 
clear that Abdul’s stances 
regarding marijuana, which 
include 
expunging 
the 

records of people who have 
previously 
been 
arrested 

for 
marijuana-related 

charges once it is legalized, 
should 
be 
the 
standard 

among democrats, as should 
the open and vocal support 
of its legalization that Abdul 
showed by having such a 
presence at Hash Bash.”

CASEY TIN/Daily


Awkward 
introductions, 

sunshine, smiles, excitement, 
energy, move-in day. 

Depression, anxiety, stress, 

confusion, final exams.

College.
Dear 
Hannah, 
and 
other 

incoming freshmen,

Congratulations on getting 

into the University of Michigan! 
You’ll be entering a new chapter 
of your life and there’s much 
to be excited about. These next 
four years will hold a lot in 
store for you, and at a place like 
the University, there’s much to 
be experienced with so many 
opportunities 
and 
resources. 

Though I won’t be able to be 
there at every step of the way 
with you, I wanted to share my 
own journey navigating these 
past four years.

Lesson 1: Context
“Best 
four 
years 
of 
my 

life.” “Work hard, play hard.” 
“Freedom from parents.” “Now 
you can have a relationship.” 
Welcome to college.

Suppose an extraterrestrial 

being were to come to Earth. How 
would you explain college? From 
an outsider’s perspective, college 
could look weird: a microcosm 
where young adolescents with 
developing prefrontal cortexes 
are virtually locked together 
within a few square miles. 
Placed in a situation, being told 
important decisions that could 
alter the course of their life are 
to be made, all while dealing 
with the normal pressures of life 
and more. This is the Pollockian 
masterpiece society has created 
to lead the education of our 
future generations.

While college may have been 

pitched as the key stepping stone 
to a future, it is not without its 
problems. As a new student, you 
will be entering with a body 
of students from all over the 
country and world. Many of 
those students will come from 
wealthy families. The average 
family income of a University of 
Michigan student was $154,000 
in 2017. A majority will be 
white. These are just a few of 
the identities your peers will be 
bringing with them. Chances are 
there will be moments where you 
feel out of place. Embrace your 
difference.

On a related note, diversity 

has become a buzzword for 
higher education institutions. 
Having a lack of it reflects poorly 
on the prestige of an institution. 
College pamphlets are filled 
with pictures of multicultural 
students sitting in a lawn on a 
sunny day laughing together. 
That is unfortunately mostly a 
marketing scheme. Though you 
may be in classes with students 
who look different from you, the 
true interactions are seldom and 
few.

Another issue I ran into was 

the lack of access to healthy 
food options. With a lack of 
easily accessible supermarkets, 
students have to put aside the 
time and effort to take the 
bus if they lack access to an 
automobile. Who knew that even 
being able to eat food would be 
a struggle? These are just a few 
of the many imperfections that 
exist. This is all for me to say 
chances are there will be times 
you encounter systemic barriers. 
Identify the issue. Fight to make 
it better for those you come after 
you. USE your VOICE.

Lesson 2: Culture
As a premed student who 

minored in a social science, I’d 
like to say I studied the human 
being, from the microscopic 
atoms 
that 
make 
up 
the 

biochemical 
pathways 
which 

fuels us to the way organisms 
think and interact with others 

on a macro level. One of the 
most 
important 
things 
I’ve 

learned about is culture — the 
amorphous, abstract force that 
shapes all of our human decisions 
and 
interactions. 
Culture 
is 

the ocean that surrounds all 
of us, carrying us to-and-fro 
with waves. To change it means 
fighting against the current.

The University itself has a 

culture. Leaders and the Best. 
That 
go-get-it, 
never 
settle 

mindset. 
That 
success-at-all-

costs mindset. The University 
also has a binge drinking culture 
and 
politically 
progressive 

culture. Not all of these forces 
are bad, but be cognizant of 
them. Be motivated but don’t be 
consumed.

While 
it 
may 
appear 
as 

though everyone around you has 
their life together, look past it. 
Remember you are human, prone 
to mistakes and errors. Behind 
every résumé an equal amount of 
failure.

Lesson 3: Community
At a big school such as the 

University, it is easy to just feel 
like one in a million. Friends and 
communities can make it feel like 
a much smaller place; however, 
don’t settle for them.

Find the people at this school 

who will be there for you, 

because they are out there. Find 
the ones who will grow with you, 
who will keep late nights with 
you, who will be able to celebrate 
your achievements as much as 
their own. Find the people who 
will also be able to take it easy 
and laugh with you. The fondest 
memories I have are those when 
I was fully in the moment and 
lost track of the time.

This not only pertains to 

your peers. Find the professors, 
graduate student instructors and 
advisers who will also be your 
support system. Fully utilize 
all the resources this place 
has to offer for you to become 
successful in your endeavors. 
When you do find someone with 
which you really connect, hold on 
and don’t let go. Make an effort 
to develop that relationship 
and be mentored by them. Your 
professors are all human beings 
too. Above all else, know when to 
ask for help. Usually the earlier, 
the better.

Lesson 4: Compassion
Freshman year, I had a chance 

to work for the dining hall. You 
learn a lot about human behavior 
working in the service industry, 
perhaps more than any class 
could ever teach.

Some people are warm. Their 

faces light up no matter the 
time or day. Their smile makes 
you smile, and you know you 
have their full attention. Others 
leave their plates on the table 
for someone else to pick up and 
text while you try to serve them. 

Two rough categories of people: 
the dish-leavers and the smile-
bringers.

Say thank you more and show 

compassion to others. The most 
rewarding experiences I’ve had 
in college were being in servitude 
to others. While culture may 
push you toward being self-
centered, help out those in need. 
It would not be possible for you 
to get this education with the 
countless hours put in by your 
family and those around you. I’ve 
never regretted writing a thank-
you note. Be kind and courteous 
to all those at the University who 
make your experience possible: 
bus 
drivers, 
police 
officers, 

resident advisers, etc.

Also, show compassion to 

yourself. Don’t take things too 
seriously. I promise your life will 
move on with the right amount 
of time. If you are skipping 
meals to study and losing sleep 
and weight, you are probably 
involved in too many things. 
Know your limits and be able to 
say no. Take care of your mental 
health as well as physical health. 
Part of being compassionate to 
yourself requires you being real 
to yourself. Confront the highs 
and lows and be vulnerable. I 
felt real change happen in the 
moments I let down my own 
pride and ego.

You won’t feel happy all the 

time. Feeling blue is completely 
normal and sometimes even 
beyond your control. Imposter 
syndrome, 
self-doubt 
and 

loneliness are a short list of 
things with which you could 
very likely deal.

Lesson 5: Consider
Finally, move beyond the 

binary. Be able to see the grays, 
blacks and whites of issues. 
Explore 
yourself. 
Challenge 

yourself and step outside your 
comfort zone. As an example, 
I had no idea how much my 
intergroup 
relations 
minor 

would mean to me before I 
started college. My eyes were 
opened to a hard truth but also 
invaluable skills and lessons. It 
became one of the transformative 
experiences of my college career. 
In addition, stick to who you 
are as a person. Where you find 
wholeness and completeness will 
most likely not be where others 
also reside.

I didn’t know what to expect 

when I started college, but 
one thing I knew for sure was 
I 
would 
explore 
everything 

socially and academically to 
grow myself. Now, four years 
older, beaten and joyful, I am 
leaving a place filled with years 
of memories for me. I wanted to 
pass my lessons onto you in some 
tangible form. Even now, I admit 
I don’t have everything figured 
out regardless of what society 
expects at my age.

I wish you the very best in 

your undergraduate years as 
you struggle and succeed. There 
may be moments when you are 
so riddled with anxiety and 
stress that you can’t see clearly. 
Moments so lonely that you 
want to cry. Times that you will 
feel like no one could be going 
through something worse than 
you are at the moment. It is all 
normal. If you were expecting 
a smooth ride, I’m here to burst 
your bubble. I’ll leave you with 
a quote from one of my role 
models.

“The ultimate measure of 

a (hu)man is not where (they) 
stand in moments of comfort and 
convenience, but where (they) 
stand at times of challenge and 
controversy.” – Martin Luther 
King, Jr.

The rest is up to you to make 

on your own and figure out along 
the way.

With much love,
Your brother, Young

Dear Mom,
Since I last saw you three 

years ago, I have thought of you 
every day. I have remembered 
the warm moments when I felt 
you loved me and you knew I felt 
the same. For the past two years 
since I last spoke to you, I have 
tried to memorize your voice 
from memory alone, have tried 
to learn by heart the screech of 
your voice when you are angry 
and the soft whimper when you 
are sad.

I am too afraid to listen to your 

voicemails. Each day, though 
I try to move on and want to 
forget you, I cannot. I cannot 
forget what I have done to you 
or what I have done to alter our 
lives forever.

I do not know what to say 

other than that I am sorry. It will 
never be enough, I know. You 
must believe me when I write 
that I would give up almost 
anything that you asked to make 
you happy. I know how you have 
suffered for most of your adult 
life, for I have been a witness, 
and it brings me great pain to 
also know I have added to that 
grief. But I could not surrender 
my freedom for your happiness 
and, to be honest, I am not sure 
that my compliance would have 
made you happier either.

It may still be difficult for 

you 
to 
understand 
why 
I 

could not follow through with 
the arranged marriage. You 
promised that he was a good 
Hindu man with a high income 

who would help me build my 
own career. I know you intended 
to secure a future for me that 
would be free of the financial 
insecurity 
that 
you 
endured 
with 

my father. But Mom — I was only 
17.

You did not ask if I wanted 

this. Instead, you hurt me, you 
blackmailed me, you hit me with 
a tree whip, you let my father 
threaten to kill me.

You did all of this to force me 

to agree to his proposal over the 
phone. You made me fear for my 
life in our home. So I could not 
stay. I know it broke your heart 
when I came home from work 
that day, grabbed a backpack, 
ran away without looking back, 
but I could not stay.

Yet, it is difficult to blame a 

perpetrator who is themselves a 
victim. I do not know what you 
have endured in life, but I have 
witnessed part of your struggle. 
I have watched my father harm 
you and threaten your life as he 
did mine. I have heard you softly 
cry, begging to God to kill you, 
when you believed my sisters 
and I were asleep.

I have tasted the meals you 

made as you spoke with your 
sister living in our homeland 
about how difficult it is to live in 
this place, alone, without her or 
your brother or your parents.

I know you have lost much 

and lose more still as the days 
pass you by.

You have hurt me, but you 

yourself have been hurting since 
I was born. I am especially sorry 
that I could not protect you from 
my father. I was a coward and 
was always as afraid of him as 
you were.

As I write, I know this is a 

letter that I can never send. 
You would not understand 
half of the words on this page 
because of the English barrier, 
and the cultural barrier may be 
an even more difficult hurdle to 
overcome. What is freedom to 
you, and what is freedom to me, 
after all?

For you, perhaps it involves 

money, the moment when our 
family can move to a suburb 
in Warren and does not worry 
about rationing the food in the 
fridge. But for me, who grew up 
reading about and seeing white 
American children’s freedom, 
it is to wear shorts in July, to 
spend time with friends without 
needing a reason, to marry 
someone I love at the time I 
choose, not someone you chose 
for me when I was still in high 
school.

I wish I could say that I would 

give up the world to see you 
again, smiling and welcoming 
me home, but we both know 
that is a lie.

If I was ready to give up 

the world for your happiness, 
I would have given you my 
world, agreed to your arranged 
marriage, not gone to college 
— lived a life that I could not 
be happy with. But I cannot 
bear to give you every piece of 
me. Our worlds are not on the 
same plane. I wonder if you have 
realized that too.

I love you dearly, and though 

I do not deserve nor expect your 
forgiveness, I hope someday 
that you will remember me 
fondly.

I hope someday that you will 

give me a call. I miss your voice.

Sincerely,
Your Eldest Daughter

A letter I can’t send to my mother

With “American Idol” coming 

back, I think it’s time we start 
calling out singing competitions 
for their insensitivity to different 
communities and cultures. Now, 
I love “American Idol.” The show, 
which 
spawned 
superstars 

like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie 
Underwood, will always have a 
special place in my heart because 
it inspires people from all walks 
of life to follow their dreams of 
being superstars. However, not 
even David Archuleta’s voice 
or Simon Cowell’s accent can 
obscure the underlying problems 
with the show. “American Idol” 
uses primarily scripted judges 
comments in order to shape 
the opinions of the American 
public. With this, we learn our 
“idols” are often white men with 
guitars. Then again, the fact 
that the show has many white 
male winners could just be a 
coincidence. What can’t be talked 
up as coincidence is how ethnic 
minorities have been treated on 
“American 
Idol” 
and 
other 
singing 

competitions. 
With 
this 
in 
mind, 
I 

have to wonder: Will this season 
of Idol contribute to the abuse 
of minorities as other network 
talent competitions?

First, there is “The Voice,” 

which once again seems like a 
fairly great concept. However, the 
singing competition is still not 
completely neutral. One specific 
instance of this is the dreaded 
“montage 
treatment.” 
Pretty 

much, “The Voice” is not able to 
show every single contestants 
audition, so they occasionally pick 
a few unlucky subjects to only 
have a couple seconds of their 
audition shown. For the rest of the 
show, this is a huge disadvantage 
because the audition is where 

viewers truly begin to connect 
with the artist. No person who 
was montaged in auditions has 
ever made the finals or even come 
particularly close. However, it has 
been seen throughout the years 
that “The Voice” often montages 
Asian contestants. With this 
treatment, it seems like many 
Asian contestants are not able to 
advance far into the competition 
because they never really got 
the chance to shine. Meanwhile, 
“The X Factor UK” has also had 
some race issues such as white 
contestant Saara Aalto singing 
“Sound of the Underground.” 
In one part of the performance, 
Aalto — who would go on to place 
second in the competition —wore 
a kimono and danced foolishly 
around the stage. Even judge 
Simon Cowell said he was a little 
uncomfortable with the outfit. 
The artist received backlash but 
was still seen as the sweetheart 
of the season. Though she faced 
backlash, the artist received 
no repercussions because the 
performance inherently had to 
have been approved by the crew 
of the television show.

Then there is “American 

Idol,” and more specifically, 
Randy Jackson. Aside from 
Jackson’s 
occasionally 
offensive 

comments, such as that time he 
told an Asian male prior to his 
audition, “You look like you’re 
going to do my taxes,” the show 
has also supported insensitive 
ideals. In one episode, there was 
a singer named Gurpreet Singh 
Sarin, who was more commonly 
called “The Turbanator” for the 
turban he wore. The nickname 
was given by Sarin to himself 
for 
his 
colorful 
turban. 
However, 

within his audition, talk of his 
turban almost covered up his 
phenomenal voice. Throughout 
the rest of the show, Sarin 

was treated as a goofball until 
eventually being eliminated. 
However, the main issue is 
that “American Idol” chose to 
highlight Sarin’s turban instead 
of the artist. With this lack of 
attention, Sarin never got to be 
the true idol of his own story. 
Instead, he was viewed as a piece 
of his turban, which would be 
used as a gag. Another moment, 
which was not just frustrating, 
but outright offensive, was when 
Shubha Vedula auditioned for 
“American Idol”. Before Shubha 
even performed, Randy was 
confused by her name and began 
pronouncing her name wrong. 
Soon after he would make her 
name a song as a joke. Now, I 
don’t believe there is anything 
wrong with mispronouncing 
names — even I have been 
subject 
to 
mispronouncing 

names because everyone makes 
mistakes. However, the editors 
of this show decided to make 
Shubha’s name a direct comical 
joke. It was once again not about 
the artist but more about the 
fact that Shubha had anything 
to do with being ethnic.

There is a deep irony in this 

idea of neglecting minority 
voices, especially in “American 
Idol”. The white guy with 
the guitar will always be the 
“American Idol,” while the 
South-Asian minority can be a 
side character for comic relief. 
Instead of acknowledging we 
are all “American,” the show 
rather chose to focus on who 
should be our idol. Currently, 
the reboot of the show so far has 
not had many mishaps, besides 
Katy Perry kissing that boy who 
had never been kissed, and 
hopefully it stays that way. With 
that, here’s to a competition 
where we can all be the idols to 
our own stories.

A

pril 
is 
Testicular 

Cancer 
Awareness 

Month. 
I 
assume 

this is new information for 
most individuals reading this 
column. In fact, I only became 
aware 
of 
this 
information 

because, a little over a month 
ago, I was diagnosed with Stage 
I testicular cancer. Now, not 
that there’s ever a “good” type 
of cancer, but as far as these 
situations go, this was pretty 
positive news. It meant the 
cancer had not spread and I 
would be able to have surgery 
the next day to completely 
remove the tumor. The surgery 
was successful and, according 
to the doctors, my brief fight 
with cancer was likely over.

I was incredibly lucky to 

have caught the tumor so early 
on; I was in the hospital for 
an unrelated injury (falling on 
hard ice during a broomball 
tournament) when they found 
the cancerous mass during 
an ultrasound. I was lucky 
I 
lived 
only 
five 
minutes 

away from the University of 
Michigan hospital, an excellent 
medical facility filled with 
even more excellent medical 
professionals. I was lucky the 
doctors and nurses asked the 
right 
questions, 
performed 

the right tests and decided 
to 
perform 
more 
in-depth 

examinations than they needed. 
I was lucky they found the 
tumor before it had spread, and 
that I didn’t need to go through 
chemotherapy or radiation.

I am writing this article 

because I am fully aware of 
how incredibly lucky I was; 
most people don’t just stumble 
upon a tumor, especially before 
their condition becomes more 
serious. In the weeks following 
this ordeal, I’ve learned a 
ton about testicular cancer, 
including 
information 
that 

would provide other young men 
the ability to identify if they 
are at risk for the disease and 
should go see a doctor without 
needing to rely on luck (or an 
accidental trip to the hospital).

Of the many interesting 

facts I learned about testicular 
cancer, the most striking to me 
was that it is the most common 
form of cancer among young 
men, with most individuals 
diagnosed between the ages 
of 15-35. I can only speak 

for myself, but cancer was 
certainly not on my radar a 
month ago, or really any other 
life-threatening diseases for 
that matter. I was a healthy, 
21-year-old student, and there 
wasn’t much in my life that a 
few ibuprofen and some duct 
tape couldn’t fix.

In talking with my male 

friends after this experience, 
I’ve found nearly all of them 
share 
a 
similar 
mindset. 

Testicular 
cancer 
is 
not 

something they actively think 
about or are routinely checking 
for. 
Though 
the 
self-check 

process that leads to early 
identification of a tumor is 
relatively quick and simple, 
almost none had ever examined 
themselves. In fact, many did 
not even know how to perform 
the procedure in the first place 
(full disclosure, neither did I 
until recently).

So what can we do about this? 

How can we make sure men are 
able to identify this disease early 
on and seek proper treatment, 
rather than leaving it up to 
chance like I had?

Well first off, if you’re a young 

man, do yourself a favor and learn 
how to perform a self-check. This 
can lead to early detections and 
an increased likelihood that if you 
do happen to discover a tumor, 
immediate action can be taken 
before more intensive care is 
needed and risks become higher.

Have 
the 
conversation 

with 
your 
peers 
and 
help 

destigmatize what is admittedly 
an uncomfortable topic. Yes, I 
still chuckle at the word “testicle” 
(because it’s funny, even at 21 
years old), but there is nothing 
unnatural 
or 
unmasculine 

about discussing your health 
and helping to create awareness 
regarding a topic that affects 
more of your peers than you 
might think. Talking with friends 
and family over the past few 
weeks, I have found out several 
men in my life have successfully 
fought testicular cancer, and yet 
there is still something taboo 
whenever the topic is brought up.

Perhaps the most important 

lesson I’ve learned is to listen to 
your body and err on the side of 
caution when deciding whether 
to see a medical professional. 
I believe this lesson applies to 
many issues beyond testicular 
cancer, whether it be that 

nagging cough that won’t go 
away or a weird bump that 
wasn’t there previously. While 
our days may often feel so 
busy and hectic that we can 
barely find time to eat lunch, 
let alone go to the doctor, it 
is important to make time for 
your health. Even if you do go to 
the emergency room, wait two 
hours to get admitted and spend 
another hour getting checked 
out only to receive a healthy 
verdict, please don’t feel as if 
you wasted your time. You just 
received confirmation that you 
are in fact healthy, and can sleep 
well at night knowing this. On 
the off-chance there is in fact 
something wrong, you can go 
ahead and get treatment before 
your situation escalates. While 
ignorance may be bliss in some 
instances, not being aware of a 
health issue doesn’t guarantee 
its nonexistence. 

I 
never 
thought 
I’d 
be 

having this conversation, let 
alone writing a column about 
my experience with testicular 
cancer. A month ago, I was 
lying in a bed in the hallway 
of the U-M hospital, listening 
to a doctor say a stream of 
words I can barely recall, 
feeling a combination of scared, 
confused and, perhaps most of 
all, powerless. Fortunately, I get 
to tell the story of an extremely 
blessed case of early detection 
and treatment. While I hope 
no one reading my column 
experiences this illness, I hope 
that if you do, you are able to 
find out early and on your own 
terms. That you can have the 
conversation with friends and 
share your story, knowing you 
are not alone in dealing with 
this. By talking about testicular 
cancer, or any health issues for 
that matter, we can better share 
information about detection, 
providing more individuals the 
opportunity to feel in control of 
their futures.

For more information and 

resources about the disease, I 
highly recommend checking 
out the Movember Foundation, 
a men’s health non-profit that 
is doing amazing work to raise 
funds 
and 
share 
resources 

about this disease, as well as 
other men’s health issues.

Empathy without action

T

he unpaid — or barely 
paid 
— 
internship 

remains instrumental 

in 
accelerating 
the 
career 

trajectories of a lot of U.S. 
college students, especially 
for careers in government, 
journalism and law. In a piece 
for the New York Times, 
Darren Walker writes, “Talent 
is equally distributed, but 
opportunity is not.” I think 
this gets at the root of our 
problem: There are thousands 
of 
talented 
students 
who 

can’t compete on the same 
level as their peers for purely 
financial reasons.

Sure, 
there 
have 
been 

attempts to remedy this — 
using social media to shame 
companies into paying their 
interns, grants from well-
funded universities, programs 
that 
mitigate 
impossible 

costs — but many times, these 
endeavors only paint a sense 
of fairness over a system that 
remains 
thoroughly 
unfair. 

This is reinforced by guilty, 
empathetic op-eds in campus 
newspapers — I won’t link 
anyone, 
in 
particular, 
to 

be polite — that stress how 
much it hurts for advantaged 
students 
to 
enjoy 
their 

internships knowing that the 
pool of competitors has been 
reduced by financial factors.

It’s not enough just to feel 

bad, as anyone who’s been 
involved with minority group 
activism likely knows; people 

with structural power need 

to use their positions to level 
the field behind them. A 
pre-law student expressing 
his or her regret about the 
typical road to a law career 
will soon enough be a lawyer, 
and — given the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
placement 

rates — maybe even one with 
extraordinary resources. Will 

this 
undergraduate’s 
guilt 

translate into postgraduate 
action?

The goal isn’t, of course, to 

tear down current advantages 
so that everyone faces the same 
difficult route forward; it’s to 
correct 
former 
inequalities 

such that talent as a factor 
increases as much as possible. 
I don’t want to condemn people 
for taking fair opportunities 
that are distributed unfairly, 
but I do want to make sure 
that we don’t reinforce the 
status quo because it’s easier 
to resolve one’s guilt than to 
resolve the problem.

There are certain careers 

worked unequally by various 
groups in American society. 
The factors that cause these 
variations are complex. The 
proportion 
of 
women 
in 

finance, for example, probably 
isn’t 
because 
of 
disparate 

household 
resources, 
but 

likely economic accessibility 
to the career path.

It’s 
(apparently) 
easy 

enough to find talent that 
can afford to advertise itself 
and has the resources for 
an unpaid internship in an 
expensive 
city 
or 
enough 

money for a summer spent 
on volunteer work instead of 
wage labor. What this means, 
though, is that we effectively 
limit access to certain career 

ladders, so to speak, by a 
child’s or young adult’s access 
to financial resources.

Our goal in minimizing this 

effect should be increasing 
competition, 
regardless 
of 

someone’s 
financial 
ability. 

When we define elite industries, 
it should be by the rigor of 
competition required to obtain 
those positions and the talent 
required to keep them, not the 
social and economic class of a 
typical worker.

Maybe 
some 
hesitancy 

around this comes from our 
complicated 
relationship 

with 
the 
concept 
of 

“deserving.” 
What 
comes 

with this, though, should be a 
recognition that all students 
deserve 
an 
otherwise 

provided 
opportunity 
to 

compete on the same level. 
If the end result of this is 
that 
some 
candidates 
— 

who would have previously 
gotten through on structural 
advantages — are eliminated 
from 
contention 
for 

prestigious jobs, so be it.

The impressive fact about 

U-M graduates is that many 
will 
rise 
to 
positions 
of 

financial, legal, journalistic 
and political power. If you’re 
among them, remember to pay 
your interns, when you have 
them. Consider housing costs 
when you recruit students 
who are compensated with 
only with the prestige of your 
organization. Remind yourself 
how important luck is in 
everyone’s success, and of the 
breaks that you’ve personally 
received. 
Remember 
how 

much you empathized, when 
you actually get the chance to 
turn your emotion into action.

It 
goes 
without 
saying 

that Cambridge Analytica’s 
collection of private data from 
tens of millions of Facebook 
users 
for 
“psychographic 

modeling” in recent American 
elections was an egregious 
violation 
of 
privacy. 
Only 

about 
270,000 
Facebook 

users 
participated 
in 
an 

original personality survey 
and consented to having data 
collected. Their information 
was then turned over, along 
with the profiles of another 87 
million users unaware of the 
academic study, to Cambridge 
Analytica.

However, 
for 
today’s 

children, 
adolescents 
and 

college students — all of 
whom were raised in or born 
into a post-9/11 surveillance 
state — personal privacy has 
always been accompanied by 
an asterisk, and control over 
personal 
information 
has 

always been understood as a 
compromise. This has resulted 
in a sort of normalized apathy, 
an immunizing agent to the 
magnitude of such privacy 
violations as Facebook’s. As 
technology continues to play 
a larger role in our everyday 
life, we, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial 
Board, 
call 
on 

college students in particular 
to better realize how personal 
data 
collection 
impacts 

large-scale 
inequalities 

and 
democratic 
processes 

throughout society.

The 
current 
case 

constitutes an example of 
such. As a firm largely owned 
by conservative mega-donor 
Robert Mercer and partially 
run by board member Steve 
Bannon, the Breitbart mogul 
and 
a 
former 
adviser 
to 

President 
Donald 
Trump, 

Cambridge Analytica used its 
data and election-influencing 
experience in its work for 
Trump’s 
2016 
presidential 

campaign. 
Remaining 

apathetic about the use of 
collected 
data 
for 
purely 

commercial purposes is one 
thing, but the construction 
of 
politically 
influential 

data 
collection 
systems 
is 

another entirely. In failing 
to adequately protect user 
privacy, which comes on the 

heels of its acknowledged 
role 
in 
spreading 
Russian 

propaganda leading up to the 
2016 
presidential 
election, 

Facebook 
is 
complicit 
in 

Cambridge 
Analytica’s 

extralegal attempt to influence 
democratic 
processes. 
This 

scandal 
now 
joins 
other 

numerous 
instances 
of 

malfeasance 
by 
big 
data 

systems, which have been 
shown to adopt and reinforce 
societal biases and perpetuate 
existing inequalities.

As much as the Facebook 

case 
demonstrates 
the 

widespread 
and 
significant 

consequences 
of 
privacy 

violations, it also reveals the 
extent 
to 
which 
activities 

like 
this 
are 
largely 
left 

unaddressed. Limitations on 
data collection for the sake 
of online privacy have, as of 
now, failed to materialize in 
Congress. However, we must 
keep in mind that alternative 
paths are simply not viable. 
Despite possible drawbacks 
to targeted advertising, its 
centrality 
to 
the 
modern 

technology industry ensures 
it 
will 
remain 
monetarily 

incentivized 
as 
long 
as 

profits 
outnumber 
any 

user 
discomfort 
it 
causes. 

Additionally, the recent calls to 
#DeleteFacebook demonstrate 
a severe underestimation of 
the platform’s utter ubiquity. 
For instance, many business 
owners depend on Facebook 
to communicate effectively, 
damaging the credibility of 
any mass deletion campaign.

Indeed, direct government 

regulation 
and 
constraint 

of companies that harness 
and 
sell 
users’ 
personal 

information 
is 
the 
only 

sensible path. For a company 

that just revealed additional, 
severe vulnerabilities in most 
users’ profiles, Facebook (and 
tech mega-firms like it) have 
so far enjoyed relatively little 
oversight. We no longer have 
to ponder the hypothetical 
consequences 
of 
such 
an 

arrangement: 
Cambridge 

Analytica’s 
unscrupulous 

handling of Facebook user 
data dismantles the notion 
that any company built on 
selling consumer data can — 
or rather, will — prioritize 
user 
privacy 
and 
enforce 

such provisions, so long as their 
service remains monetarily free.

Moreover, the foundation 

is 
already 
in 
place 
for 

government to take action: 
A 
majority 
of 
Internet 

users 
find 
targeted 
ads 

distasteful, 
pointing 
to 
a 

need for legislation similar 
to 
the 
European 
Union’s 

soon-to-be enacted General 
Data Protection Regulation. 
As current alternatives for 
maintaining privacy remain 
laborious and esoteric, we 
must 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 

progressive governance has 
routinely shifted the onus of 
protection from the consumer 
to the producer (think: the 
FDA, EPA, etc.). Therefore, 
we at the Editorial Board call 
on Americans to push their 
elected representatives to pass 
meaningful legislation limiting 
technology companies.

Treating 
online 

advertisements 
like 
TV 

advertisements, 
where 

sponsors 
must 
be 
openly 

disclosed, is a good start to 
increased transparency, as are 
requirements that consumer

Facebook users would be wise 
to channel their dissatisfaction

take back ground in the fight

our personal data.

For today’s college

FROM THE DAILY

We cannot be apathetic about Facebook
M

ore than two weeks after Facebook’s massive data leak of user 
information to voting analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was 
first exposed, new revelations on the extent of the tech titan’s 

privacy violations continue to surface. Facebook’s most recent confession, 
which inflates the number of Facebook users whose profiles were wrongly 
harvested to a staggering 87 million, serves as a chilling reminder of the 
malicious implications of modern technology. The sheer scale of Facebook’s 
data breach has inspired a renewed and thorough reflection of our society’s 
perception of privacy. But while this activism is indicative of a well-meaning 
and timely shift in public attitude toward the practice of data collection, 
it fails to address the problems beyond Facebook. A greater awareness of 
efforts to exploit our private information must also include calls for greater 
oversight of technology companies themselves.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Monday, April 9, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

To be quite honest, this 

particular column is not so 
much about an album as it is 
about a song. A song that’s 
one of those rare tracks that 
transcends being an ultimately 
forgettable cut on an album. It’s 
one of those songs that requires 
your undivided attention for 
its entirety and leaves you in 
a whirlwind state of slipping 
in and out of lucidity as you 
lose yourself to its downright 
infectious groove. And when it 
ends, you have no choice but to 
put down your headphones and 
recuperate since you know that 
music in general just won’t live 
up to your expectations for the 
near future.

But first, some background. 

Fela 
Kuti, 
the 
legendary 

Nigerian “Afrobeat” musician 
(a term which he himself 
coined), 
wasn’t 
originally 

planning on being one. He 
arrived in London in the late 
1950s to study medicine, but 
instead decided to end up 
studying music, enamored with 
the burgeoning jazz scene in the 
city. He soon traveled back to 
Nigeria to fully devote himself 
to music and (to abridge things 
quite a bit) developed a long, 
legendary career making music 
just as daring and inventive 
politically and socially as it 

was musically. From Zombie to 
Best of The Black President, his 
music was revered throughout 
Africa 
and 
eventually 
the 

world, combining upbeat, jazzy 
instrumentals with scathing 
social commentary.

Gentleman 
is, 
in 

comparison, not one of his 
most canonized albums, but 

its titular track is Fela Kuti at 
his bold, catchy and doesn’t-
give-a-fuck best. The first 30 
seconds set the track’s groove, 
with an electric piano that 
solos shortly but eventually 
acts as an announcement of 
Kuti’s tenor saxophone. As 
the percussion drops out, Kuti 
performs the first of several 
solos until introducing the 
track’s main melodic theme 
around two minutes in. Soon, 

the percussion reappears with 
a funky electric guitar backing 
as Kuti spends the next six 
minutes 
launching 
into 
a 

meandering, delightful solo.

Kuti 
himself 
arrives 
at 

around the eight-minute mark 
singing, “I no be gentleman at 
all” in his uniquely powerful, 
soaring voice. He punctuates 
his repetitions of this line with 
energetic vocalizations that 
make him seem like he’s running 
out of breath before he launches 
into an even more powerful 
chant. He confidently asserts: “I 
be Africa man, original.”

In typical Fela Kuti style, he 

sings in a distinct pidgin dialect 
as he criticizes the hypocrisy of 
those of his countrymen who he 
feels have been too Anglicized. 
He sings, “Africa hot, I like am 
so / I know what to wear, but 
my friends don’t know” as he 
then describes the impractical 
uniform some of his countrymen 
dress in as an indirect form of 
acquiescence to their colonial 
masters while forgetting their 
own roots.

Throughout its 14-minute 

span, “Gentleman” never ceases 
to be wildly entertaining. Like 
a lot of Fela Kuti’s music, it is 
imbued with a sense of utter 
freedom, 
individuality 
and 

relentless 
energy. 
Although 

the two other tracks on the 
short album are worthy cuts 
themselves, the title track is a 
Fela Kuti magnum opus and a 

‘Gentleman’ by Fela Kuti

WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

‘Legion’ basks in trippy 
state of second season

In its first season, FX’s “Legion” 

was revolutionary in the way it 
abandoned the predictable limits 
of superhero TV. Taking a more 
cinematic approach towards telling 
an intimate and introspective story, 
“Legion” focused 
less on its Marvel 
origins and more 
on the complexity 
of 
the 
mental 

illness consumed 
protagonist, 
David 
Haller 

(Dan Stevens, “Downton Abbey”). 
Shooting every scene with the look 
and feel of a movie, the combination 
of the series’s hypnotizing special 
effects and Jeff Russo’s (“Fargo”) 
stimulating score made “Legion” 
one of the most ambitious television 
thrills of 2017.

Last season revealed that David 

— whose delusions and ravaging 
thoughts were believed to be caused 
by schizophrenia — was, in truth, 
one of the most powerful human 
mutants to ever exist. It turns out 
that much of his mental instability 
was really the result of being 
infected by an evil parasite called 
the 
Shadow 
King, 
aka 
Amahl 
Farouk 

(Quinton 
Boisclair, 
“Channel 
Zero”), 

since childhood. If season one was 
a dynamic look into David’s insanity 
in 
a 
“normal” 
world, 
then 
season 
two 

will be more about the ways David is 
actually “the sane man in an insane 
world,” as intended by creator Noah 
Hawley (“Fargo”).

This season’s premiere begins 

with David waking up from his year-
long comatose state inside Division 
3, a hidden organization which 
recruits good mutants to search for 
the missing Shadow King. Though 
David believes that he was only gone 
for a single day, all of his comrades 
have quickly adjusted to the new 
normal of working alongside the 
old enemy without him. Just as 

David questions, we 
all too are wondering 
what happened to 
Summerland 
and 
why 

there are women with 
mustaches singing.

But being “Legion” 

means 
it’s 
highly 

unlikely that we’ll get any direct 
answers right off the bat (or ever). 
While the premiere does provide 
some recapping and follow-up on 
the cliffhanger of the last season’s 
finale (you know, when David was 
captured by a glowing orb and 
suspiciously floated away), it’s clear 
that this time around, “Legion” 
would still rather take us through 
a maze than provide us with direct 
resolution.

Yet, it’s exactly that mystery and 

frustrating lack of clarity that makes 
“Legion” so addicting. By traversing 
through the inner workings of 
David’s mind, we are constantly left 
questioning what we see. Do the 
random dance-fight sequences have 
a greater meaning? Are the trippy 
intermediating narrations from Jon 
Hamm 
(“Mad 
Men”) 
foreshadowing 

of what’s to come, or just pauses to 
provoke self-reflection? Important 
information within “Legion” is 
conveyed through moments of 
intense detail and overwhelming 

action alike, which leaves us to piece 
together our own interpretations.

Once again, Dan Stevens is 

exceptional as David in every way. 
Portraying moments of hopeless 
confusion 
to 
heart-wrenching 

compassion, Stevens manifests the 
unforeseeable 
future 
of 
his 
character 

with sublime ease. With a cast of 
other greats who will hopefully 
get more screen-time as we go on 
— including Aubrey Plaza (“Parks 
and Recreation”) as Lenny, David’s 
confidant who is currently held 
captive by the Shadow King, and 
Rachel 
Keller 
(“Fargo”) 
as 
Syd, 
David’s 

recurring love interest — “Legion” 
has all the necessary flair to excel in 
season two.

Additionally, with the familiar 

but 
just 
as 
awe-inspiring 

cinematography of the premiere 
alone, it’s evident that “Legion” will 
remain 
as 
artistically 
inventive 
as 
last 

year. 
Though 
“Legion” 
has 
no 
distinct 

time setting, the opening scene 
depicting 
Lenny 
and 
Oliver 
(Jemaine 

Clement, “Moana”) laying on a pool 
raft under the sun is colored and shot 
impeccably, aesthetically reflecting 
the retro vibe of the ’70s. It’s those 
mind-bending camera angles and 
distorting 
effects 
that 
flip 
the 
visuals 

of your typical superhero shows on 
their 
heads, 
and 
prove 
that 
skillful 
TV 

can feel like a film.

Though the season two premiere 

may be unsatisfying in giving us any 
sort of explanation, it is extremely 
satisfying 
in 
style 
and 
potential. 
With 

the anticipation of a larger focus on 
David’s character evolution and the 
substance of his delusions, season 
two is shaping up to elevate and 
impress.

SAYAN GHOSH

Daily World Music Columnist

“Life is like sex. Sometimes 

you 
have 
to 
change 
your 

position.” These words appear 
in Kali Uchis’s handwriting 
on an art poster inserted in 
every physical copy of her 
debut 
album 
Isolation. 
On 

the poster, Uchis is sprawled 
across a sea of sapphire satin, 
strikingly contrasted by her 
revealing 
ruby 
attire. 
This 

scene is pictured from a more 
intimidating 
angle 
on 
the 

album cover, but still remains 
a visual vignette of the music 
contained within, a flaring heat 
and eclectic heartbeat subdued 
by the essentially blue themes 
espoused right from the title.

Uchis has always operated 

from the sidelines. To the public, 
her name was only noticed 
when it was preceded by a 
more renowned one, like Tyler, 
the Creator on his two latest 
records, 2015’s Cherry Bomb 
and last year’s Flower Boy, or 
Daniel Caesar on his Grammy-
nominated single “Get You.” 
However, while not discounting 
her stellar collaborative work, 
Uchis’s solo output has far 
outclassed her features yet 
received a fraction of the love. 
Deciding to release a debut 
album on a weekend dominated 
by Cardi B’s own Invasion of 
Privacy and another chart-
topping Drake single may seem 
a poor bet, but the premiere of 
Kali Uchis in her entirety is a 
statement. With Isolation, the 
magically subtle new-age pop 
star seduces attention under a 
kaleidoscope limelight.

The 
album’s 
colorfully 

filtered mood lighting is set 
right from the opening track, 
where 
Uchis 
croons, 
“I’m 

sick and tired of talking, told 
you 
everything 
you 
need 

to know / The rest is in the 
body language,” over a bossa 

nova-inspired 
Thundercat 

bassline. That selfsame body 
is 
consistently 
profound 
in 

its language over the next 45 
minutes, melodically narrating 
the story of a woman long 
manipulated, 
slighted 
and 

tossed aside. Uchis is insistent 
on leaving a regretful lover 

behind on “Dead to Me,” the 
harsh realities of cheating are 
almost happily recounted on 
the 
Amy 
Winehouse-esque 

“Feel Like A Fool,” and she 
juxtaposes her tiresome life 
making ends meet with the 
destructively glamorous image 
of “Miami.” The latter track is 
actually one of the few moments 
on the album where Uchis is in 
control of her body, above the 
infidelity of heartbreakers and 
detractors, reiterating her fierce 
attitude towards fame with one 
of the best self-assured lines in 
recent memory: “Why could I 
be Kim? I could be Kanye.”

By portraying this tested 

and tempestuous version of 
herself, Uchis speaks to “the 
people who feel trapped in their 
position” in hopes “the music 
will enable (them) to change 
it,” like the poster cursively 
declares. Her music is capable 
of change, wonderfully inviting 
and artfully hypnotic. The silky, 
mellifluous blanket that Uchis 
dons with poise is interwoven 
with threads of soul, funk, 
hip hop and Latin grooves, as 
Isolation has enlisted a veritable 
team of wide-ranging musicians 
to soundtrack its spirit. Steve 
Lacy’s 
uniquely 
youthful 

bass is layered over a beat 
produced by Romil Hemnani 
(of BROCKHAMPTON fame) 

on “Just A Stranger.” Damon 
Albarn chimes in not only 
vocally 
but 
with 
Gorillaz’s 

bleeps and bloops on “In My 
Dreams” and Kevin Parker 
galvanizes “Tomorrow” with 
his signature psychedelic flair. 
British 
R&B 
phenom 
Jorja 

Smith and Colombian reggaeton 
leader Reykon round out the 
impressive and international 
list of features.

While it would be easy for 

Uchis’s voice to be drowned in 
such an ocean of talent, Isolation 
remains distinctly hers. Even on 
the album’s most star-studded 
single “After the Storm,” where 
Tyler, 
the 
Creator, 
Bootsy 

Collins and BadBadNotGood all 
pour in, Uchis harnesses those 
contributions to intensify her 
essence. The track manages 
to furtively bear the central 
weight of the album while 
staying 
sonically 
warm 
as 

sunshine. In the music video, 
Uchis appears to be longing for 
love (which she finds by literally 
and humorously growing Tyler 
from a packet of seeds), but 
her nuanced movements and 
unflinching eyes tell another 
story.

The 
person 
who 
Uchis 

addresses 
throughout 
the 

song is the listener, not some 
sweetheart of her dreams. This 
person is anyone who has ever 
experienced the isolation she 
has, left to face their demons 
alone. The title of the album 
does not refer to absolute 
solitude — instead, it embodies 
loneliness in the face of others, 
masked by self-deception and 
empty sentiment. Uchis is too 
familiar with the endless days 
of struggle yet still she knows 
“times are rough but winners 
don’t quit / So don’t you give 
up, the sun’ll come out.” Even 
though Isolation is rooted in 
empathy, it is aware it doesn’t 
quite have all the answers. 
After all, “everybody’s gotta go 
on, don’t they?”

Kali Uchis offers sublime 
world on debut ‘Isolation’

Anderson wins best in 
show with ‘Isle of Dogs’ 

Few modern directors have 

a cinematic style as unique, 
idiosyncratic and identifiable 
as that of Wes Anderson (“The 
Grand Budapest Hotel”). It’s for 
this reason that the director’s 
name is so frequently used as 
an adjective, with each new film 
hailed as the most 
“Wes 
Anderson” 

Wes Anderson film 
yet, and inspecting 
his 
filmography, 

it’s not hard to 
see why. In each 
of his films, the 
audience explores 
a wide array of 
gorgeously crafted, 
meticulously 
detailed settings, 
almost always carrying with 
them 
a 
distinctly 
vintage 

feel. From the purposefully 
baroque “The Grand Budapest 
Hotel” to the wistful “Moonrise 
Kingdom,” all of Anderson’s 
films seem to carry with them 
echoes of the past, like a story 
about some long-gone relative 
passed down by one’s parents. 
Anderson has seemed, to many, 
to be unwaveringly true to a 
singular artistic vision.

However, with the addition of 

his latest release, “Isle of Dogs,” 
it seems that old dogs truly can 
learn new tricks. Set in the near 
future, the film tells the story 
of Atari (Koyu 
Rankin, 
“Juken”), 

a young boy separated from 
his dog Spots (Liev Schreiber, 
“Ray Donovan”) when Mayor 
Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura, 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel”) of 
Megasaki City decrees that all 
dogs must be banished to Trash 
Island, a desolate, rat-infested 
pile of garbage off the coast of 
mainland Japan. Leaving the 
city 
behind, 
Atari 
comes 
to 
Trash 

Island hoping to reunite with 
his furry companion. The film’s 
futuristic landscape, infused 
with homages to Japanese 
culture, is a complete departure 
from anything Anderson has 
done before. Gone are the 
picturesque hotels in the Alps 
and the quaint New-England 
summer camps. Trash Island, 

where the majority of the film 
is set, is disgusting. Infested 
with rats and barely vegetated, 
the film’s color palette consists 
predominantly of reds, greys 
and blacks. The world of “Isle 
of Dogs” is one overrun with 
mankind’s greed, corruption 
and apathy. It should serve, 
then, as the ultimate proof 
of Anderson’s ability that he 
still manages to make this film 

beautiful.

That 
very 

juxtaposition 
of 
beauty 
and 

sadness is part of 
what makes all of 
Anderson’s films 
so 
enthralling. 

Where “Isle of 
Dogs” sets itself 
apart, however, is 
the scope. Many 
of 
Anderson’s 

characters have dealt with 
immense personal pains, such 
as the grieving brothers from 
“The Darjeeling Limited,” but 
rarely 
are 
these 
struggles 

extrapolated into the context 
of larger social systems. “Isle 
of Dogs” features its share of 
touching personal struggles, 
but at its core is a film that 
laments 
mankind’s 
cruelty 
while 

simultaneously celebrating its 
capacity for good. It examines 
the personal struggles of people 
(and dogs) caught up in large, 
amoral systems. It’s poignant 
commentary, and one can’t help 
but see vestiges of Megasaki 
realized in our own society, one 
increasingly plagued by greed, 
pollution and xenophobia. 

Captured via stop-motion 

animation — Anderson’s second 
full venture in the medium 
following 
2009’s 
“Fantastic 

Mr. Fox” — with a splash of 
traditional 2D animation, the 
film is an absolute labor of love 
from the first frame to the end 
credits. It’s such an impressive 
testament 
to 
Anderson’s 

ongoing desire to grow as a 
filmmaker, and is evident in 
the pure ingenuity that goes 
into every scene. He never 
cuts corners, often introducing 
breathtakingly 
intricate 

backgrounds and settings only 
to use them for a single scene, 
sometimes as brief as a few 

seconds. It’s not all set pieces 
either; the film’s characters are 
all animated in such immense 
detail. The way Anderson has 
animated 
watering, 
tearful 

eyes in the film is particularly 
impressive and is sure to evoke 
some sniffles from the audience. 

Anderson begins the film 

with a disclaimer informing the 
audience that all characters will 
speak in their native languages, 
and that “All barks have been 
rendered into English.” That 
is to say, the film’s Japanese 
characters will go unsubtitled. 
It’s a curious decision to make, 
and one that’s stirred some 
controversy, with Anderson’s 
harshest critics calling it a way 
to silence Japanese people in 
a film that borrows so heavily 
from their culture. Supporters 
of Anderson, meanwhile, call 
it nothing more than a unique 
design choice for the film, and 
cite the expansive list of notable 
Japanese talents involved in the 
film, including voice cameos 
from Ken Watanabe (“Rage”), 
Yojiro Noda (lead singer of 
the popular Japanese band 
Radwimps) and Yoko Ono. The 
film feels almost like a sort of 
cultural mishmash, blending a 
plethora of artistic and cultural 
influences and perspectives. 
Audiences will have to decide 
for themselves if this blending 
more closely resembles cross-
pollination or bastardization. 

A technical marvel and a clear 

labor of love, “Isle of Dogs” is a 
worthy installment in the ever-
growing Wes Anderson canon. 
The film challenges our notions 
of mainstream animated feature 
films, which have been hard-
pressed to gain recognition as 
anything more than children’s 
movies. Significantly darker 
than “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” which 
was marketed as a family movie, 
“Isle of Dogs” has a lot to show 
its audience, and never feels 
simplified or euphemistic. You 
wouldn’t expect it from an 
outlandish film about animated 
dogs, but “Isle of Dogs” may 
be one of Anderson’s most 
impressive 
and 
poignant 

offerings to date. The director 
continues to cement himself as 
a prolific auteur who, after 20 
years, still hasn’t peaked.

FILM REVIEW

Few works of art can sustain 

an audience’s focus for three 
and a half hours. It’s hard to ask 
people to walk into the theater 
at 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday and 
leave at 11:00 p.m.

Yet, the School of Music, 

Theatre 
& 
Dance’s 
recent 

production of Tony Kushner’s 
“Angels in America Part I: 
Millennium 
Approaches” 

managed to do this and more. 
It was a captivating story of gay 
life in the ’80s in Manhattan, 
and while many of the cultural 
references were dated, the 
meaning and significance of 
the work remain relevant in the 
current cultural and political 
climate.

The play focuses on three 

groups of characters and the 
interactions between them. 
First is Louis Ironson and his 
AIDS-stricken 
lover 
Prior 
Walter. 

As Prior’s sickness progresses, 
Louis struggles to cope. Next is 
Mormon law clerk Joe Pitt and 

his anxious, pill-addicted wife 
Harper Pitt. The Pitts’ struggle 
to understand Joe’s closeted 
gay 
identity, 
especially 
in 

regard to their strict religious 
beliefs. Lastly, the story follows 
closeted lawyer Roy Cohn as 
he faces threats of disbarment 
from the New York Bar, a 
character who is loosely based 
on the historical figure. Cohn 
also faces a sudden diagnosis 
with AIDS and a perpetual 
denial of the disease that he 
faces.

Though the subject matter 

is incredibly serious, the play 
contains many brief moments 
of humor. They form a bulwark 
against 
the 
dark 
subject 

matter as a whole, allowing the 
audience to laugh at moments 
when tears might be more 
appropriate. 
At 
one 
point 

during Prior’s hospitalization 
scene, I found myself laughing 
as a defense mechanism against 
the terrible anguish that I knew 
the characters on stage must 
have been facing.

Despite my great attempts, 

it also became hard to separate 
the current political overtones 
surrounding the play from the 
play itself. Cohn, after all, was an 
early mentor for Donald Trump. 

Trump learned his strategy 
of aggressive litigation from 
Cohn during his legal spat with 
the Justice Department over 
alleged fair housing violations 
in his New York properties. It 
was easy to see echoes of Trump 

in Cohn and Cohn in Trump. At 
one point, Cohn is visited by the 
ghost of Ethel Rosenberg; the 
aggressive, heartless nature of 
legal legacy was exposed to the 
audience in his recollections 
of successfully prosecuting the 
ghost.

As a relic of the ’80s, the 

play serves as a reminder 
of the negative side of the 

Reagan years. The closeted 
nature of gay life in the ’80s, 
for example, is hard to fully 
contemplate in relation to our 
increasingly accepting society. 
The fears of the AIDS epidemic 
and the allegedly indifferent 
government response to it also 
feature prominently into the 

play’s overall plot. 

At its core, however, the 

play is about the morally and 
ethically 
bankrupt 
makeup 

of American society. As Louis 
proclaims in act three, “There 
are no angels in America, no 
spiritual past, no racial past, 
there’s only the political.” 
America, Kushner argues, is an 
ever-changing power struggle 
between various groups and 
individuals. It lacks a central 
theme or overarching purpose.

The play ends with Prior 

being visited by an angel. As 
Prior recoils in awe and terror, 
the angel proclaims that Prior 
is a prophet and that the “Great 
Work begins.” While the staging 
throughout 
the 
production 

had been minimal and bare, it 
was this image of a suspended 
angel flapping two floor-to-
ceiling wings over the bed of 
the terrified Prior that stuck 
with me as I left the theater. 
It was stunningly beautiful, 
and despite the three hours 
that I had already spent in the 
theater, I felt myself wishing for 
more.

The 
minimal 
staging 
matched 

the small cast; the play featured 
only eight actors and one 
offstage percussionist. Every 
member of the cast performed 
brilliantly, 
many 
adopting 

multiple roles. One actress, for 
example, played Joe’s mother, 
the Rabbi, Henry and Ethel 
Rosenberg. Another played The 
Angel, 
Emily, 
Sister 
Ella 
Chapter 

and A Homeless Woman. 

This was a reminder of the 

power of theater in its simplest 
form. This was theater stripped 
of all glitter and glamour; it 
was theater at its simplest, 
and theater at its best. It was 
long, 
meandering 
and 
yet 

frighteningly powerful. It was a 
chilling statement on the very 
makeup of American society, a 
complex, 
thought-provoking 

and 
haunting 
depiction 
of 

the failures of contemporary 
American society.

Ultimately, the work’s central 

tenet is that there is no central 
tenet of contemporary society. 
Kushner suggests the human 
condition to be an endless 
power struggle in a moral 
vacuum, a harsh fight between 
progressive and reactionary 
forces in absence of any guiding 
beliefs.

For the love of the game or for all the wrong reasons
W

elp, let’s just say 
it hasn’t been an 
easy week to be a 

Michigan fan. 

If you remember what I’m 

talking 
about, I’m 
sorry for 
bringing it 
up again. 
I know 
that your 
professors 
did enough 
of that all 
week. I’ve 
never heard 
so many annoyed groans in 
my life. 

If you don’t remember the 

past week that well, I can 
honestly relate. Whether it’s 
the fact that April showers 
this year have consisted of 
both snow and rain or that I 
turned 21 a week ago and took 
on the Ann Arbor bar scene, 
my sense of time has been 
pretty off lately.

In any case, we need to 

talk about it. Not about the 
National Championship and 
Frozen Four themselves, 
because I know some people 
who have been covering the 
teams all year and did a better 
job of that than I could. 

But what I do want to talk 

about is the different types of 
sports fans I saw on the day 
of the National Championship 
game.

Classes were still in session 

last Monday, but you wouldn’t 
know it based on the turnout 
I witnessed throughout the 
day. To be fair, I missed my 
first class as well. But mind 
you, it was the night after my 
aforementioned 21st. 

I woke up at 10 a.m. in a 

groggy fog and thought the 
day’s festivities had just 
begun, only to find out that I 
was already late to the party. 
The lines at popular gameday 
locations such as Good Time 
Charley’s and Buffalo Wild 
Wings had started forming as 

early as 8 a.m., according to 
my Snapchat. Tip off wasn’t 
until after 9 p.m. 

As I headed to my 11:30 

a.m. work shift in the MLB, 
I expected the usual hustle 
and bustle 
of students 
rushing 
between 
classes. Instead, 
Ann Arbor 
looked like a 
ghost town.

At work, I 

overheard a 
conversation 
at the copy 
machine 
between some of the 
international lecturers in 
the Romance Languages and 
Literatures Department. 
They were asking each other 
about the unusual number of 
absences that morning. They 

didn’t seem to know what the 
big deal was. 

The first class I attended 

was up on North Campus at 
1:30 p.m. Any of the buses 
that go there tend to be pretty 

crowded, 
to the point 
where people 
are essentially 
standing on top 
of each other. 
But I had no 
trouble finding 
a seat that day. 

My acting 

class is pretty 
small as is, with 
just 18 students. 

Even though we were 
rehearsing our final scenes 
to be filmed the next week, 
we just barely hit double-
digit attendees. Fortunately, 
none of the absentees were 
scheduled to go that day.

We have to turn off our 

cell phones in that class 
because they interfere with 
the equipment, which was a 
relief because I had already 
spent too much time watching 
my friends’ 
Snapchat 
stories and 
trying to 
convince myself 
that I could 
take the whole 
day off.

My next 

class was at 4 
p.m, by which 
point even 
Scorekeepers’ 
Bar and Grille and Rick’s 
American Cafe — the popular 
nighttime destinations — had 
opened early so people could 
start their watch parties. If 
they had already pregamed 
through the afternoon, those 

people might not make it to 
tipoff. 

When my class ended at 

5:30 p.m., I thought about 
heading to one of the bars 
myself to join in on the 

action and 
atmosphere. But 
I didn’t. 

The tables 

would have 
been long gone 
by that point, 
and I had no 
intention of 
standing up for 
the duration of 
the game. The 
ridiculously 

long lines would have been 
gone too, but I had no desire 
to watch the game surrounded 
by drunk people who didn’t 
know the difference between 
a point guard and a 3-pointer. 

In all honesty, I watched 

the game alone in my 
apartment, and I’m not 
embarrassed to admit it. 
Before you start laughing, let 
me explain. 

I didn’t take the day off or 

go out to a bar because I knew 
the temptation would be too 
strong. If Michigan won it all, 
I wanted to remember it. I’m 
probably not supposed to say 
that, but as a second-semester 
senior who could have had a 
national championship as a 
birthday present, objectivity 
is hard to come by. I’m 
graduating in three weeks, let 
me have this. 

If you did go out all day 

because you wanted to absorb 
the moment with your friends 
and follow along closely with 
your fellow Wolverines, then 
you would have been doing it 
for the love of the game. And 
you’re in the right.

But if you did it because you 

wanted to drink for the hell of 
it and have an excuse to party 
on a Monday, then you would 
have been doing it for all the 
wrong reasons. And you’re 
really missing out.

The people in the latter 

category would have been 
the ones I heard yelling 
angrily in the streets — I live 
a block away from Skeeps 
— or stumbling out of bars 
on South U sobbing — as my 
friends later told me — after 
the game. The people in the 
former category would have 
surely been disappointed but 
to a lesser degree, because 
they would have known that 
Villanova was always the 
better team. 

Call me a purist or 

pretentious, there is probably 
truth to both. But the point is 
that championship games only 
come around so often. When 
they do, you should really be a 
part of the former.

‘M’ finishes second at Big Ten Championships

As Jacob Moore prepared 

for his final tumbling pass, the 
crowd at Crisler Center cheered 
for him to stick the landing of the 
triple twist. He landed with his 
feet glued to the floor, just as he’s 
done multiple times this season.

The 
judges 
rewarded 
the 

freshman’s clean floor routine 
with a score of 14.700 — the 
highest score of the night on the 
event — in the team competition 
of 
the 
men’s 

gymnastics 
Big 
Ten 

Championships, 
where 
No. 

5 
Michigan 

finished 
in 

second 
place 

with a score of 
408.600, 
just 

over five points 
behind 
No. 
8 

Illinois’ score of 
413.900. 

The 
Wolverines 
opened 

the competition on floor, with 
Moore, redshirt junior Marty 
Strech and junior Emyre Cole 
executing their routines well to 
earn scores in the 14s. All three 
qualified for Saturday’s event 
final, and the scores for the team 
competition allowed Michigan to 
get out to a strong start.

“Strong scores, pretty good 

landings for almost everybody,” 
said Michigan coach Kurt Golder 
of the first event. “A good start 
to the meet, good event for us to 
start on.”

Moore led off on pommel 

horse with a low-scoring routine, 
requiring his teammates to step 
up and hit clean routines to get 
the team back in the hunt for a 
Big Ten title. Sophomore Mack 
Lasker answered the bell with 
a score of 14.000, tied for his 
second-best mark of the season.

The 

Wolverines 
built 
on 
the 

pommel 
horse 

momentum 
and 
earned 
a 

competition-
high 68.700 on 
rings, with each 
gymnast scoring 
into 
the 
13s 

and 
freshman 

Cameron 
Bock 

scoring 14.050, just .05 below his 
best mark of the season.

Senior Dmitri Belanovski was 

up first on rings and capped a 
well-executed routine with a 
stuck dismount to score 13.850. 
Three of his four teammates also 
stuck their dismounts, earning 
Belanovski, Bock and junior Ryan 
Dunning spots in the individual 
event final.

“We had our highest stick 

percentage on rings since I’ve 
been 
at 
Michigan 
tonight,” 

Golder said. “You eliminate some 
deductions, you get some bonus 
points. It’s just steady, keep 
plugging away, and usually you 
get better.”

Vault has been a strong event 

for Michigan all season, and 
that trend continued Friday. 
Freshman Nick Guy and Moore 
both stuck their vaults, and Cole 
took just a small step on his own 
vault landing.

Junior Anthony 

McCallum 
returned to the 
vault lineup for 
the 
first 
time 

since suffering an 
injury in January 
and 
landed 
his 

Tsukahara double 
pike on his feet for 
the first time all 
season to earn the 
second-highest 
score of the day on the event.

“It was nerve-wracking, it 

actually was a little bit more 
nerve-wracking than I wanted 
it to be,” McCallum said. “Last 
night I was like, ‘Okay, it doesn’t 
matter if I fall,’ just to give myself 
a little bit of margin for error, but 
once I got up there I was like, 
‘Wow, I really wanna land this 
because I wanna help the team.’ 

… Once I landed it, I was just 
excited to have that over with.”

The Wolverines headed into 

the fifth event, parallel bars, 
with the best score among teams 
that had already taken their bye. 
Belanovski led off with a clean 
routine, but trouble ensued when 
junior Uche Eke stepped up to 
the bars.

Eke struggled early in his 

routine before falling on his 
dismount, notching a score of 
only 11.300. Cole, McCallum 
and Bock all hit clean routines 

with McCallum 
securing 
a 

spot 
in 
the 

event 
final, 

but the scores 
left 
Michigan 

in need of a 
season-best 
performance 
on high bar to 
secure the win.

A 
week 

after 
earning 

their best score of the season, 
inconsistency crept in for the 
Wolverines. Redshirt junior Alec 
Krystek stuck his dismount and 
earned a score of 13.250 in the 
leadoff spot, followed by another 
clean routine from Strech.

Belanovski started well, but he 

slipped going to a handstand and 
nearly fell, which caused him to 
receive a large deduction and 
score 12.550. Then Eke missed 
the bar on his difficult Kovacs 
release 
and 
fell, 
effectively 

ending Michigan’s chance at a 
win.

“We’ve already changed the 

routines,” Golder said. “I think 
maybe in (Belanovski’s) case he 
was trying to be too perfect, he 
put it right in the handstand and 
it went the wrong way. Uche just 
happened to miss the release, the 
rest of it was okay, and when you 
do that skill, you know, it’s a D 
because it’s high risk. D-value, 
you run a little higher risk, and 
sometimes you miss it.”

Inconsistency on parallel bars 

and high bar has been an issue 
for the Wolverines all season, 
and Friday night, it cost them a 
Big Ten title.

In two weeks, it could cost 

them a chance at a national title.

The Michigan men’s gymnastics team struggled down the stretch to finish in second place at Big Ten Championships.

“A good start to 
the meet, good 
event to start 

on.”

“We had our 
highest stick 
percentage on 

rings.”

Michigan falls short 
at NCAA Regionals

It was a moment of triumph amid 

heartbreak.

Brianna Brown was up on the 

uneven bars. It was the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team’s last 
routine of the night — and of its 
season. But for the senior, it wasn’t 
over yet.

Her lines were crisp and clean, 

her releases high, her handstands 
straight. And she stuck her double 
layout dismount with precision. 
She scored a 9.95, enough to put her 
on the podium as the uneven bars 
champion. But for the rest of the 
team, it was too little, too late.

Entering 
Saturday’s 
NCAA 

Regional, 
the 
seventh-ranked 

Wolverines were heavily favored to 
earn one of the two available NCAA 
Championships berths. But heavily 
favored doesn’t mean a thing if you 
can’t capitalize, and uncharacteristic 
errors from Michigan left it with a 
score of 196.350 to finish in fourth 
— behind No. 6 Alabama, No. 18 
Georgia and No. 23 Illinois.

“It’s extremely upsetting,” Brown 

said. “ … We wanted nothing more 
than to be out there with our team 
in prelims and Super Six. It’s not 
something you really expect to 
happen.”

Right off the bat, there were signs 

of trouble. On the balance beam — 
generally the Wolverines’ strongest 
event — all six gymnasts hit their 
routines. But there was a bobble 
on a flight series here and a messy 
dismount there. It would become a 
theme.

On the floor exercise, senior 

Lauren Marinez over-rotated her 
double pike and sat it down. It 
wasn’t a fatal mistake in isolation 
— teams, after all, can drop one 
score. But it eliminated Michigan’s 
margin for error. A short landing 
here and a stumble back there, and 
the Wolverines found themselves 
counting a 9.625. Even junior Emma 
McLean — the team’s most dynamic 
floor worker — didn’t have her best 
routine, garnering a 9.85.

By the time the vault rolled 

around, it was clear that Michigan 
would need to put up big scores on its 

final two events to pull off a top-two 
finish. But the Wolverines’ lineup 
was depleted by the absence of junior 
Olivia Karas due to a torn Achilles, 
and a bruised heel forced McLean 
to water down her difficulty. When 
freshman Syd Townsend — the 
only remaining gymnast to vault a 
difficult Yurchenko 1.5 — couldn’t 
hold onto her landing, it was clear 
that it wasn’t Michigan’s night. 
Bent legs here and a piked-down 
landing there, and all of a sudden, the 
Wolverines needed to average a 9.9 
— an almost impossible proposition 
— to even finish in second.

Before the uneven bars, Michigan 

had a bye. It was a chance for the 
Wolverines to clear their heads. 
They had to perform knowing 
their chances of making the NCAA 
Championships were all but over.

“We basically just said, ‘We know 

what we have to do,’” Brown said. 
“‘We just have to go out there and do 
what we practiced. And if we do that, 
we’ll be fine.’”

Before going up, Brown cleared 

her head. She thought about her 
weekend plans. She thought about 
her sister’s volleyball tournament. 
She thought about everything but 
her bar routine, and she went out 
there and hit. It was one high note in 
a meet full of sour ones.

Brown’s 
performance 
was 

enough for a third-place finish in 
the all-around in addition to the 
bars title. That placement qualified 
her for NCAA Championships as an 
individual. But without the rest of 
her team, the victory felt hollow.

“We came in here thinking we 

were the team to beat, and yes, we 
probably were the team to beat,” 
Brown said. “But that’s just not how 
it worked out.”

It wasn’t a dramatic collapse. 

Rather, it was a bobble here and a 
misstep there. It was little things 
that added up to become big things. 
It was a bad night at the worst 
possible time.

“I’m incredibly heartbroken for 

these young women,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki in a statement. “... 
They deserved more and we didn’t 
get it done today. It hurts, but I am 
very proud of these women for all 
they have accomplished.”

Wolverines sweep Nittany Lions

Even in a three-game sweep 

of 
a 
struggling 
opponent 

like Penn State, it took a 
considerable 
amount 
of 

toughness on the part of the 
No. 17 Michigan softball team 
to make sure that everything 
went to plan.

Locked in a scoreless tie at 

the top of the seventh inning 
of the second game of the 
series, freshman outfielder Lou 
Allan knew it was time to stop 
catching up and start making 
something happen. Up to that 
point, the Wolverines (31-7) had 
been shutout by a Nittany Lions 
team (6-27) they beat 14-2 the 
day before. 

After being one of the highest 

recruits in the country last 
year, Allan has spent much of 
the year injured, and has slowly 
improved since. But against 
Penn State, she hit her first 
career home run in the opening 
game.

Instead 
of 
celebrating 

though, Allan and the rest of 
the team faced the prospect 
of 
a 
momentum-halting, 

disappointing loss the next day. 

Just like the loss earlier this 
season against Iowa, when the 
Wolverines’ rally in the seventh 
inning was too little too-late, 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
seemed 

almost insurmountable at the 
plate.

Allan, though, made sure 

history didn’t repeat itself. She 
swung through a changeup 
and crushed a two-run homer, 
piercing 
right 
through 
the 

hearts of the Penn State players, 
eliminating much of their hope 
for an upset. 

“I was just trying to do 

whatever I could in order to 
score the runs, and then we 
were all fighting so hard to 
get some runs on the board 
in that game,” Allan said. “It 
was a little bit of a struggle, 
but I think the biggest thing 
was, we just needed to make 
adjustments.”

Although 
the 
other 
two 

games in the series were both 
run-rule blowouts, it would 
be a mistake to assume that 
the Wolverines didn’t bring 
the same level of toughness to 
them.

“It doesn’t feel any different, 

it’s still, we’re still just playing 
the game, but honestly, we go 

out and our mentality is that 
we wanna get in, play five 
innings, and then get out,” 
Allan said. “And score as many 
runs as possible, because we 
know we’re able to do that and 
we’re good enough to go up 
there and just stay on a hitting 
streak and score the runs that 
we need to.”

Freshman 
left-hander 

Meghan 
Beaubien 
reeled 

off three consecutive wins, 
including a combined three-
hitter with senior right-hander 
Tera 
Blanco 
on 
Saturday. 

Beaubien currently boasts the 
most wins of any pitcher in the 
country, and the duo anchored a 
Wolverine defense that allowed 
just three runs all weekend. 

“The defense starts on the 

mound,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “The pitcher 
has to be having good game 
management, 
and 
although 

(Blanco) did get into a few full 
count 
situations, 
although 

a few more than I probably 
would like. She really, she was 
just on her game as far as being 
mentally tough and her defense 
supported her. 

“We made all the plays we 

needed to make.”

‘M’ extends winning streak to 15

With 
an 
inning 
left 
in 

Sunday’s 
series 
finale, 
the 

Michigan 
baseball 
team 

was locked in a 3-3 tie with 
Northwestern.

Four 
batters 
later, 
the 

Wolverines extended their win 
streak to 15 with a 7-3 victory.

As it has been throughout 

the streak, Michigan’s pitching 
was the difference over the 
weekend in Evanston. After a 
postponement Friday, it opened 
the series with back-to-back 
shutouts of the Wildcats (1-8 
Big Ten, 8-17 overall), 6-0 and 
3-0, in Saturday’s double header 
— the first consecutive shutouts 
in Big Ten play since 2006 for 
the Wolverines (6-0, 19-11).

Sophomore 
left-hander 

Tommy Henry kicked off the 
weekend 
with 
six, 
two-hit 

innings 
Saturday 
afternoon, 

striking out nine in the process.

An 
hour 
later, 
freshman 

left-hander Ben Dragani took 
the 
mound 
for 
game 
two 

and proceeded to one-up his 
teammate, allowing just one hit 
over his seven innings — a single 
to lead off the second inning.

“They did a great job of 

executing the game plan,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“They 
both 
pounded 
the 

strike zone. Very aggressive, 
very consistent with all their 
pitches. It was just fun to watch 
those guys in action.”

After starting the season as a 

reliever, Bakich moved Dragani 
into the rotation three weeks 
ago against Bowling Green. 
Since then, he has worked 26.2 
innings with 19 strikeouts and 
just a single earned run against 
him.

“It 
became 
very 
clear 

through the first couple of 
weeks that we would need to 
expand his role,” Bakich said. 
“And he’s earned a starting role 
in the rotation.

“It’s 
one 
thing 
to 
have 

multiple 
pitches 
you 
can 

throw 
for 
strikes, 
what 

makes him very good is the 
competitiveness that he pitches 
with and the poise that he has 
on the mound.”

While the Michigan rotation 

was the story of the weekend, 
its bullpen and defense both 
played major roles in the sweep. 
The 
bullpen, 

which struggled 
early 
in 
the 

season, has not 
given up a run 
since April 28 
against Central 
Michigan — a 
15.2-inning 
streak.

“Everybody’s 

feeding off of 
each 
other,” 

Bakich said. “The guys go in 
and see what the previous 
guy did before him … and the 
confidence is extremely high 
right now.

“Everyone in the bullpen has 

the confidence of the entire 
team that he’s going to get the 
job done.”

The 
defense 
meanwhile 

— one of the points of pride 
for Bakich’s program — has 
returned to being a staple after 
a rough start to the season.

They committed 26 errors 

in their 4-11 start, but the 
Wolverines have just 17 during 
their win streak — only further 
emphasized by an error-free 

weekend.

“Guys are starting to settle 

into their roles,” Bakich said, 
“so that breeds confidence 
and they can start to express 
themselves more freely and 
play more loosely.”

Offensively, Michigan relied 

on a balanced approach with 
at least seven players recording 

a hit in each 
game. Freshman 
first 
baseman 

Jesse 
Franklin 

hit 
the 
only 

home 
run 
of 

the series in the 
opener but he 
and five other 
Wolverines 
combined 
for 

seven doubles in 
the sweep.

“(It was) good execution (on) 

offense,” Bakich said. “Guys 
had a lot of timely hits, we had 
two-out RBIs in every game, we 
were good at getting guys home 
from third base, good at taking 
extra 90 (feet).”

Next 
weekend, 
Michigan 

will face Maryland (3-2, 15-6), 
its toughest challenge in weeks. 
The Wolverines, though, are 
thinking about neither the 
Terrapins, nor the win streak.

“We’re really more focused 

on the training that we’re going 
to have this week before we 
even get to Maryland,” Bakich 
said. “. . . We don’t talk about 
the streak.”

“The 

confidence is 
extremely high 

right now.”


ST. PAUL, Minn. — For 

the final time as Michigan 
hockey 
players, 
senior 

forwards Dexter Dancs 
and Tony Calderone stood 
up to leave the postgame 
press conference.

After mounting a 14-4-

1 record in their last 19 
games heading into the 
Frozen Four on Thursday 
night, 
the 
Wolverines 

lost, 4-3, to Notre Dame 
in heartbreaking fashion, 
allowing 
the 
shocking 

game-winning goal with 
just 5.2 seconds left in 
regulation.

As 
the 
puck 
left 

Fighting Irish forward 
Jake Evans’ stick and 
slipped 
through 

sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne’s 
blocker pads, so 
did 
Michigan’s 

chance 
at 
a 

10th 
national 

championship.

A 
puffy-

eyed 
Dancs 

and 
subdued 

Calderone 
— 
a 

Michigan 
hat 

shading his face from 
reporters — began to 
walk off the stage, and 
the college hockey scene. 
It was the last time the 
best friends represented 
the maize and blue, and 
maybe 
the 
last 
time 

playing hockey together, 
with Calderone signing a 
contract with the Dallas 
Stars Sunday night.

Before 
the 
seniors 

could leave, Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson, 

seated next to the 
players, rose to his 
feet and blocked the 
steps down from the 
stage.

First, he grabbed 

Dancs and pulled 
him in for a hug. 
Three slow pats 
to the back of the 
head, 
one 
to 
the 

back and a smack on the 
shoulder.

Then came his captain, 

Calderone. One hand on 
his back, the other on his 
head and then two taps on 
the back.

And then they left.
Pearson sat back down, 

let out a deep exhale and 
puffed out his cheeks. 
Then he began answering 
questions 
from 
the 

media. 
First, 
Pearson 

congratulated 
Notre 

Dame 
and 
coach 
Jeff 

Jackson. Then, he spoke 
about his seniors.

“I’m extremely proud of 

our team, especially our 
seniors,” Pearson said. “I 
thought as the game wore 
on there, we were starting 
to play. … Unfortunately, 
it was just a bad bounce 
there at the end.

“My only regret is I 

don’t have more time with 
the seniors. The seniors 
have 
been 
outstanding 

for us this year. And I 
wish I had them back for 
another few years.”

***
The impressive 

senior 

campaigns 
began during the first half 
of the year. Calderone, 
Dancs and junior forward 

Cooper Marody led the 
way 
for 
a 
struggling 

Wolverine 
offense. 
At 

that point, the “DMC” 
line accounted for almost 
40 percent of Michigan’s 
total points on the season.

If 
the 
trio 
was 

connecting 
on 
all 

cylinders, 

the 

Wolverines 

won games. If they were 
off their game, the team 
faltered.

Halfway 
through 

the 
season, 

Michigan 
was 8-10-2, 
but Pearson 
continued 
to trust his 
veterans 
to 
pave 

the way to 
win 
and 

inspire 
their 
teammates.

“I think 

there’s 
always 
a 
little 

bit of a 
worry 
when 
you 
get a 

new 

coach,” 
Dancs 
said 

late 
Thursday 

night. “It’s easy for 
new coaches to come in 

and play the young guys 
and get things going. But 
Coach Pearson was so 
good to us seniors and … 
we really appreciated it, 
for everything (he’s) done 
for us.”

For their swan songs, 

Calderone 

and 

Dancs 
both 
posted 

career-highs 
in 

goals, assists and 

points. An All-

Big Ten second-

team honoree, 

Calderone 
ended 
as 

the 
top 

conference 
scorer with 
25 goals, to go 
with 19 assists and 
44 

points. Dancs added 11 
tallies and 15 helpers for 
26 points.

Both contributed two 

goals and three assists in 
the NCAA Tournament, 
including the first two 
scores 
against 
Notre 

Dame, 
which 
helped 

open 
a 
2-0 

lead early in 
the second 

period.

Then 

there 
was 

senior 
defenseman 

Sam 
Piazza. 

The 
two-year 

alternate 
captain 

became 
the 
first 

Michigan 
player 
to 

earn Senior CLASS All-
American honors since 
the 
award’s 
inception 

in 
2006, 
recognizing 

an athlete who uses his 
“platform in athletics to 
make a positive impact 
as 
leaders 
in 
their 

communities.” Piazza also 

provided a solid blueline 
presence, notching nine 
goals and 27 assists in 96 
career games.

Defenseman 
Cutler 

Martin 
and 
forwards 

Niko Porikos and Alex 
Roos rounded out the six-
person graduating class. 
This was a group handed 
the 
daunting task 
of 

playing 

under a 

new coach 

and steering 

a team of 17 

underclassmen. 

They 
labored 

through 
matchups 

against 
Big 
Ten 

powerhouses 
and 

faced adversity during 

what was supposed to be 
a rebuilding season.

“They’ve 
been 

tremendous 
to 
our 

young 
players 
in 
that 

locker 
room,” 
Pearson 

said. “They’ve given us 
everything 
they 
have. 

And that’s all we ask of 
our players, just give us 
everything 
you 
have. 

Nothing more, nothing 
less.

“The seniors are not 

only good hockey players, 
they’re 
tremendous 

people, 
good 
students. 

They represent Michigan 

in the right way. And 

I’m very proud of 

those guys.”

***
Following 

Thursday 
night’s loss, in 
the 
hallowed 

underbelly 
of 
the 

Xcel Energy Center, the 
Wolverine dressing room 
was filled with slumped 
shoulders 
and 
bowed 

heads.

Suddenly, an emotional 

freshman 
stood 
and 

began to speak, according 
to Pearson. He thanked 
the seniors for taking him 
and many other rookies 

under their wings. He 

thanked 
them 
for 

accepting him as a 
part of the team, 
for welcoming him 
to the Michigan 
hockey family.

Calderone, Dancs 

and the rest of the 
upperclassmen 
began the season 
carrying 
the 

Wolverines. 
As 

if 
that 
wasn’t 

enough, 
it 
was 

what they did away 
from 
the 
ice 
— 

especially for the 
youngsters — that 
made a significant 
difference down the 

stretch.

Earlier in the 
season, 
the 

coaching 

staff 

emptied 
forward Dakota 
Raabe’s locker to 
send a message to the 
freshman about working 
harder on and off the ice. 
Highly-touted 
freshman 

defenseman 
Quinn 

Hughes had amassed a 
stretch of 24 scoreless 
games, 
his 
lone 
tally 

before Feb. 9 coming in 
Michigan’s season opener 
against St. Lawrence. The 
seemingly 
never-ending 

battle for the starting 
goaltender position kept 

a leader from emerging in 
net.

In 
the 
meantime, 

Calderone and the other 
seniors 
took 
control. 

They 
led 
by 
example. 

Though Calderone knew 
how to score, Pearson 
told him last April that 
he needed to improve his 
all-around 
commitment 

to the game of hockey. 
He needed skating, speed 

and conditioning if he 
truly wanted to play at 
the next level.

Calderone worked day 

in, day out to improve, 
and did. The effort was 
contagious.

As the back half of 

the season began, the 
underclassmen began to 
up their games. Raabe 
became a bright spot on 
the penalty kill, regularly 
the 
first 
skater 
down 

the ice to challenge an 
opponent’s 
power 
play 

unit. Hughes, a probable 
top-five 
pick 
in 
the 

2018 NHL Entry Draft, 
racked up four goals and 
nine assists in his last 12 
games. Many others came 
to life during nail-biting 
games against formidable 
enemies.

Then 
there 
was 

Lavigne 
who 
won 

the 
starting 
job 
and 

became the Wolverines’ 
defensive 
backbone. 

After Thursday’s game, 
Calderone 
called 
him 

the team’s best player 
the second half of the 
year and a bedrock for 
Michigan’s 
program 

looking forward.

By 
the 
end 
of 
the 

season, the torch had 
been passed, the drive and 
determination 
trickled 

down to underclassmen. 
Just as Red Berenson had 
laid the foundation for 
Pearson to take over, so 
had Calderone and the 
seniors for the players 
who followed.

“Honestly, 
I 
think 

it might have been my 
favorite year of hockey in 
my life,” Calderone said. 
“I think being announced 
captain, 
just 
being 
a 

senior and getting to see 
some of these younger 
guys was truly special.

“Like Dexter said, we 

had so much fun this year 
on and off the ice, (it was) 
never a dull day coming 
to the rink. I want to 
thank Coach Pearson for 
that and the guys in that 
room. I think, we’re life-
long friends and we’ll 
have each other forever.”

The 
friendships 
will 

last forever. And they 
may not have won the 
national 
championship, 

but 
Calderone, 
Dancs 

and all the skaters who 
laced up for the last time 
in Michigan colors have 
their fingerprints all over 
the team, their legacy 

ready to live on for 

years to come.

***

From the 

season’s 
start, 
it 

wasn’t a secret 
the 
Wolverines 

weren’t the best group 
of players in the country, 
and they accepted that.

“It 
wasn’t 
the 
most 

talented team I’ve had 
here in four years,” Dancs 
said, “but it was the best 

team and we just loved 
being around each other

The 
talent 
may 
not 

have always been there, 
but 
new 
leaders 
have 

since 
emerged. 
The 

third-youngest team in 
college hockey is now 
full 
of 
relative 
youth 

ready to take the next 
step in re-energizing the 
Michigan hockey culture 
and 
re-solidifying 

itself 
as 

one of the 
most storied 
programs in 

the nation.

With 5:25 left in the 

third 
period 
against 

Notre 
Dame, 
the 
line 

of 
freshmen 
forwards 

Jack Becker and Michael 
Pastujov and sophomore 
forward 
Nick 
Pastujov 

applied 45 seconds of 
pressure in the Fighting 
Irish zone. It was Michael 
Pastujov who hacked and 
whacked at the puck until 
it found its way into the 
back of the net to knot the 
game, 3-3.

It wasn’t Calderone or 

Dancs or another veteran. 
It was a freshman — 
and 
one 
who 
hadn’t 

seen consistent playing 
time until January. The 
moment personified the 
expectations 
for 
years 

to come — young players 
gaining 
experience 
in 

big moments and leading 
the team in the right 
direction.

“I think a lot of people, 

when they talk about us, 
(they) talk about how 
we lacked that depth,” 
Calderone said. “But the 
goal coming from Mike 
Pastujov like that, just 
shows 
that 
(we 
have 

depth). They’ve done it 
multiple times this year 
in the second half of the 
year we had all four lines 
going. And that’s what got 
us going.”

From 
1991 
to 
2012, 

Michigan 
made 
22 

consecutive tournaments, 
an 
NCAA 
record 
that 

still stands. In that time, 
the Wolverines advanced 
to 11 Frozen Fours and 
captured 
two 
national 

championships, in 1996 
and 1998.

But in Berenson’s last 

five seasons, Michigan 
failed to qualify for the 
tournament four times. 
After going 13-19-3 last 
season, the chances to 
return to the playoffs 
anytime soon, let alone 
in the first year of the 
Pearson 
Era, 
looked 

bleak.

This season’s late push 

and 
the 
unexpected 

tournament 
run 

positions the Wolverines 
in 
a 
positive 
light. 

With 
seniors 
and 

underclassmen 
forging 

the way for Michigan, the 
team isn’t the underdog 
anymore, but now a viable 
contender for next year’s 
title.

As Pearson sat with 

Dancs and Calderone, a 
choked-up, yet confident 
coach began the press 
conference with neither 
grief nor disappointment, 
instead 
beaming 
with 

pride 
for his 
players 
and 
a 

promising 

future.

“It’s good to be back 

here,” he said of the 
Frozen Four appearance. 
“Michigan will be back 
here again.”
