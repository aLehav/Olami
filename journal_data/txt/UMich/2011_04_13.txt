The Untverstty, where the
idea for the U.S. Peace Corps
was conceived, isnow one of the
top schools for the nomber of

The University was recently
ranked sixth to the 2011 rank-
ings of the Peace Corps's Fel-
l'ows/USA graduate school
program, which has 25 Univer-
sity students currently enrolled.
The Peace Corps Fellows/USA
Program was instituted at the
University in 2007. The pro-
gram allows students to obtain
graduate degrees in the School
of Public Policy or the School
of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment at a reduced cost in
exchange for volunteer work in
underserved areas within the
United States.
The University of Arizona

took the number one spot for the
most number of students in the
Fellows/USA program at 58 stu-
dents. The University of Arizona
was followed by the University
of Denver, Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, the Teachers.College at
Columbia Ujnhversity and'Duke
University.-
A similar but separate Peace
Corps program, the Master's
tnternational program Allows
students to obtain a graduate
degree in social work, education
or natural resources and envi-
ronment while servinig overseas

for the first time starting in the
upcoming academic year.
Each program is made up of
returned vohuntees who have
completed between 24 and 27
months of service in the Peace
Corps.

LSA junior Btrendan Green
was studying in a University
* program in Cairo, Egypt in Jan-

uary when thousands of protes-
tars took to Tahrir Square to
demand the dismissal of Egyp-
tian President Hosni Mubarak.
Despite Green's location
halfway around the world, John
Godfrey, assistant dean of the
Rackham Graduate School, was
able to contact Green through
information providej.' n the
University's online travel reg-
istry. He then worked with the

University-partnered HT H
International Student Health
Insurance to arrange Green's
flight out of Cairo on Feb. 1.
Though first developed in
2001, the travel registry has
undergone drastic changes in
recent years, according to AT
Miller, director of the Global
Intercultural Experience for
Undergraduates, or GIEU
Program. The University is

planning to unveil a master
directory of all study abroad
programs, called M-Compass,

A controversial allocation of
council funding in North Quad
Residence Hall has led to a reduc-

tion of the allotment and the pas-
sage of a prevention measure in a
separate residence hail to ensure
a similar circumstance doesn't
arise there in the future.
Followingcriticismthatmoney
was unethically allocated for
a service trip to Peru for a few
North Quad residents, the North
Quad Multicultural Council
voted on Sunday to reduce the
amount of funding appropriated

for the trip by $500.
The council came under scru-
tiny after it approved $2,000 dol-
lars in funding for the trip during
a meeting on Sunday, March 27.
The decision to reduce funding
for the trip was made after seven
residents dropped out of the pro-
gram. Two of the residents held

several companies.
The resolution asked that
the University divest from

More than a dozen students,

Several motions asking that
the resolution be taken off the

Telling stories through anthropology

What do you teach
here, and how would you
describe your teaching
style?
I teach two large lecture
classes, Introduction to
Anthropology and Medi-
cal Anthropology, and two
small seminars - an under-
grad Honors seminar, Cul-
ture and Medicine, and a
graduate seminar, Theory
and Practice in Medi-
cal Anthropology. I am, at
heart, a storyteller, and I
think that's a central part of
my teachingstyle.
When did you decide
that you wanted to pursue
anthropology?

I went to college plan-
ning to be an English major.
I took Intro to Anthro my
first semester to fulfill my
social science distribu-
tion requirement and fell
head over heels in love. It
wasn't until I was in gradu-
ate school that I discov-
ered medical anthropology.
Anthropology provided a
way to think about illness
and healing that amazed
me.
Why do you like teach-
ing at the University of
Michigan?
I remember the thrill of
discovering anthropology
for the first time, and it is

wonderful to see students
make that same discovery.
Inmysmallerclasses, Ienjoy
the lively discussions among
students who often bring
very different perspectives
to the material. In large lec-
ture classes, I love the chal-
lenge of finding new ways to
present core concepts as the
world around us changes.
Where didyougoto col-
lege?
I went to Franklin and
Marshall College, a small
liberal arts school in Lan-
caster, Pennsylvania. I never
had a class with more than
25 students, and looking out
over my first class of 600

101-ers, I wondered what it
must be like to be in a sea of
other undergraduates.
What do you enjoy
doing in your spare time?
I love to read, and I sing in
a choir. I'm always involved
in some sort of art or craft
project, with varying
degrees of success. I spend
Fridays working for Food
Gatherers, our local food
rescue program. I start the
day at the Delonis Center
Shelter Community Kitch-
en, and after serving lunch I
work at the Food Gatherers
warehouse for the rest of the
afternoon.

MSA
From Page 1A
Grumman specializes in mili-
tary aircraft and radar technolo-
gies, anid has supplied military
apparatuses used in war crimes
by the'United Nations fact-find-
ing missions, such as the Israeli
military. The Israeli military
hadupsed these weapons to sus-
tain its illegal occupation of Pal-
estine and has violated - and
continues to violate - dozens
of United Nations resolutions in
doingso."
LSA junior Bidal Baydoun, one
of the authors of the resolution,
spoke on behalf of the authors.
Despite the mention of Israel in
the resolution, Baydoun said the
authors' main intention wasn't to
focus on any specific country the
company supplied to, but rather
on the company itself.
"I don't care about Israel, I
don't care about Palestine, I care
about the University of Michi-
gan," he said.
Baydoun and other speak-
ers advocating for the resolu-
tion argued that the resolution

doesn't have political or religious
significance.
Several students including
LSA sophomore Yonah Lieber-
man, chair of J Street UMich - a
pro-Israel student organization
on campus - spoke against the
resolution.
"We have serious concerns
with the resolution," Lieberman
said. "Divestment is a polarizing
tactic when we should be work-
ing together."
Lieberman said J Street
UMich believes voting on the
resolution would heighten ten-
sion between Israelis and Pales-
tinians.
However, others expressed
their support for the resolution.
Robert Lipton, an associate pro-
fessor in the Medical School,
said he is in favor of the resolu-
tion and identified himself as an
"American Jew."
"I am not anti-Israel. I'm anti-
human rights violations," Lipton
said. "I'm in support of social
justice whether it's Egypt, Israel,
Yemen ... or the Bronx."
Lipton went on to voice his
support for the resolution, com-
mending students' efforts.

"I think this is a very powerful
step," he said. "Student action is
unbelievably important."
But Business School sopho-
more Todd Siegal encouraged
MSA not to vote for the resolu-
tion in its current form.
"These four companies are
very different and need to be
dealt with on individual and
separate occasions," Siegal said.
"Passing this resolution tonight
would eliminate the possibility
of future dialogue on this issue."
After attending to the rest
of its agenda, the assembly
returned to the resolution for a
final discussion and vote.
Before the final vote, Engi-
neering Rep. Zeid El-Kilani
proposed an amendment to
the clause regarding Northrop
Grumman. MSA voted in favor of
the amendment, which changed
the clause about the company
so that it didn't explicitly state
Northrop Grumman's involve-
ment with Israel or any other
country.
After much debate, the assem-
bly voted down the amended res-
olution in a 10-12 vote, with two
abstentions.

150th anniversary of Confederate
attack on Fort Sumter commemorated

Obama issues
proclamation on
Civil War
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP)
- Booming cannons, plaintive
period music and hushed crowds
ushered in the 150th anniversary
of America's bloodiest war yes-
terday, a commemoration that
continues to underscore a racial
divide that had plagued the nation
since before the Civil War.
The events marked the 150th
anniversary of the Confederate
bombardment of Union-held Fort
Sumter in Charleston Harbor,
an engagement that plunged the
nation into four years of war at a
cost of more than 600,000 lives.
Several hundred people gath-
ered on Charleston's Battery in
the pre-dawn darkness, much as
Charleston residents gathered 150

years ago to view the bombard-
ment of April 12,1861.
About 4 a.m., a single beam of
light reached skyward from the
stone works of Fort Sumter. About
a half hour later, about the time
the first shots were fired, a second
beam glowed, signifying a nation
torn in two.
Nearby, a brass ensemble played
a concert entitled "When Jesus
Wept" as hundreds listened, some
in foldingchairs, others standing.
Fifty years ago during the cen-
tennial of the Civil War, there was
a celebratory mood. But yesterday,
the 150th anniversary events were
muted. Even the applause seemed
subdued.
At the White House, President
Barack Obama captured the som-
ber mood in a proclamation that
the date would be the first day of
the Civil War Sesquicentennial.
"On this milestone in American
history, we remember the great

cost of the unity and liberty we
now enjoy, causes for which so
many have laid down their lives,"
the statement released by the
White House said.
Alluding to the war's ultimate
end in 1865, Obama added: "When
the guns fell silent and the fate
of our Nation was secured, blue
and gray would unite under one
flag and the institution of slavery
would be forever abolished from
our land."
"We are the United States of
America - we have been tested,
we have repaired our Union, and
we have emerged stronger," his
proclamation added.
Of about 1,200 people attending
two main commemorative events,
only a handful were black. One
man whose Confederate ances-
tor is credited with firing the first
shot of the war acknowledged his
family legacy as a "mixed bless-
ing."

No injuries in
ground accident
between aircrafts
NEW YORK (AP) - A fright-
ening collision between one of
the world's largest airliners and a
commuter jet on a dark, wet tar-
mac at Kennedy Airport is under-
scoring worries about ground
accidents as U.S. airports begin
handling a new generation of
giant planes.
A total of 586 passengers and
crew members were aboard the
two aircraft Monday night when
the left wing of an Airbus A380
operated by Air France clipped
a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional
jet flown by Comair, spinning the
smaller plane nearly 90 degrees.
No one was injured.
The superjumbo Airbus is so
immense - as tall as a seven-sto-
ry building, with a wing span as
wide as a Manhattan block - that
its wing almost cleared the small-
er plane. But not quite.
"It's the sheer size of these air-

craft and the congestion at these
airports that's the problem," said
Allan Tamm, a consultant with
Avicor Aviation, based in Port-
land, Ore. "It's a serious concern
for all these airports trying to
accommodate these aircraft. It's
going to happen more and more."
The collision happened at one
of the nation's most congested
airports on a rainy night when
flashing lights reflecting off wet
tarmac can obscure small air-
craft. It comes as airports around
the country are beginning to
receive a new class of huge air-
craft.
Fourteen airports have
obtained waivers from the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration to
receive the new Boeing 747-8,
which falls intothe same new size
class as the A380, The Associated
Press reported this week. And
Boeing is working with 13 more
airports to get approval from the
FAA, though not all of them may
require waivers.
Most U.S. airports cannot
legally handle the A380 or 747-8
because of FAA space require-

ments aimed at keeping planes
from bumping into each other.
But the FAA can issue waivers if
airport officials agree to certain
procedures, such as using only
certain taxiways or halting other
traffic when one of these mam-
moth planes is on the move.
Many ofthe airports asking for
permission to handle the Boeing
747-8 may have trouble handling
them, especially when aircraft
are turning, Tamm said.
"A lot of these airports are only
marginally ready," he said.
The flurry of new waivers
coincides with an increase in air
traffic as the U.S. economy recov-
ers. The number of passengers
flying in the U.S. increased from
767 million in 2009 to 782 million
in 2010.
JFK was built in the 1950s,
when jets were smaller. Airport
officials had to secure FAA waiv-
ers for both the A380 and the 747-
8. Monday's collision might spur
the FAA to take a second look at
JFK's rules for handling large
aircraft, said aviation consultant
John Cox.

NEW YORK
Zipcar revs up for
public offering
Zipcar Inc., the car-sharing
company that rents rides for as
little as an hour, is expected to
get a warm reception from Wall
Street for its planned initial pub-
lic offering this week.
Its supporters think skyrocket-
ing gas prices will make car shar-
ing more popular. They praise
Zipcar's technological savvy and
its plans for overseas expansion.
Zipcar is "one of the long-
awaited hot tickets in the IPO
valley," said John Fitzgibbon,
founder of IPOscoop.com. Inves-
tors are warming up to IPOs
again after the market sputtered
in2008 and 2009.
Still, Zipcar has never been
profitable since it was founded
in 2000. It expects to lose money
again in 2011. Cars, its main
expense, don't come cheap.

U.S. Energy Dept.
backs solar project
Federal energy officials are
putting financial support behind
two huge solar energy projects in
California that could create hun-
dreds of jobs and power 145,000
homes.
Energy Secretary Steven Chu
yesterday announced a condi-
tional offer of $1.2 billion in loan
guarantees for the California Val-
ley Solar Ranch project on the
state's Central Coast. The project
would use new technology to fol-
low the sun, increasing efficiency.
Chu announced the move at
a new factory near San Jose for
SunPower Corp., which would
sponsor the project. Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. would purchase the
power.
The project is expected to cre-
ate 350 construction jobs and
power 60,000 homes.

10 sets of human
remains found in
Long Island case
Police in New York confirm
that remains found this week dur-
ing a search for possible victims
of a serial killer are human. That
makes 10 sets of remains found
along a beach highway in recent
months.
The first remains found Mon-
day morning were about 1.5 miles
east of the entrance to Jones
Beach on Long Island. Later in
the day, a skull was found several
miles away.
The findings in Nassau County,
outside New York City, come after
police in neighboring Suffolk
County uncovered eight sets of
human remains since December
along the same highway.
Police ended an extensive
search of the area yesterday, but
say they could return.

Authorities suspect a serial
killer may be responsible for at
least some of the deaths. They
have not named any suspects.
KINGSTON, Jamaica
Jamaica mulls pot
decriminalization
Officials in Jamaica say the
Caribbean island's government
will review decade-old recom-
mendations to decriminalize
possession of small amounts of
marijuana for personal and reli-
gious use.
Six Cabinet ministers will eval-
uate a 2001 report by the National
Commission for Ganja - as mari-
juana is known in Jamaica.
The government-appointed
panel argued that marijuana is
"culturally entrenched" in Jamai-
ca and that moderate use has no
negative health effects on most
users.
The United States has spent
millions of dollars trying to eradi-
cate the drug in Jamaica. A U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman did not

their NATO allies, includingthe
United States, to intensify the
campaign against the Libyan
regime.
But hopes for a rebel military
victory have faded and diplo-
matic efforts to find a solution
were picking up momentum.
On Wednesday, diplomats will
gather in the tiny Gulf nation of
Qatar for a meeting of the Libya
contact group, which aims to
coordinate an international
response to the conflict.
On Monday, African leaders
tried to broker a cease-fire but
were immediately shot down
when the opposition insisted
that Gadhafi give up power
immediately.
For his part, Libyan govern-
ment spokesman Moussa Ibra-
him insisted that any talk of
Gadhafi stepping down, which
has also been suggested by
some European officials, was

"imperialist" thinking and he
lamented that the rebels had
not followed suit in accepting
the African proposal.
The Libyan rebels have prov-
en to be far weaker and out-
numbered by Gadhafi's forces
and without NATO airstrikes,
they could face a crushing
military defeat. So any real-
istic rebel hopes of unseating
Gadhafi now rest firmly on
international political pressure
combined with sustained NATO
airstrikes.
French Foreign Minister
Alain Juppe said NATO was not
doing enough to ease the pres-
sure on Misrata. He also said
the alliance should be firing on
the weapons being used by Gad-
hafi's troops to target civilians
in Misrata, the only city in west-
ern Libya that is still partially
in the hands of rebels. Interna-
tional groups are warning of a
dire humanitarian crisis in Mis-
rata, Libya's third-largest city.
Paris lamented the limited
U.S. military role in Libya and
chided Germany for its lack of
involvement. In a dire analy-
sis, France's defense minister
acknowledged that without
full American participation
in the combat operation, the-
West probably can't stop
Gadhafi's attacks on besieged

rebel cities.
Britain's Foreign Secretary
William Hague agreed that the
allies must "intensify" their
efforts.
France has played a particu-
larly aggressive role in Libya
in recent weeks, pushing diplo-
matically for a U.N. resolution
to allow the international mili-
tary operation and firing the
first strikes in the campaign.
France also was the first to rec-
ognize the Libyan opposition
and to send a diplomatic envoy
to the rebel-held city of Beng-
hazi.
A NATO general rejected the
criticism and said the alliance is
performing well and protecting
civilians.
Dutch Brig. Gen. Mark Van
Uhm said the alliance was suc-
cessful in enforcing an arms
embargo, patrolling a no fly
zone and protecting civilians. "I
think with the assets we have,
we're doing a great job," he said.
NATO took over command of
the operation over Libya from
the U.S. on March 31.

House to consider
measure tomorrow,
Senate to cast
votes on Friday
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Despite scattered opposition
from both ends of the political
spectrum, House Republicans
and the White House both pre-
dicted approval yesterday for
the hard-bargained $38 billion
package of spending cuts that
narrowly avoided a government
shutdown.
House Democratic leaders
remained non-committal on the
legislation, sealed late last week
in negotiations that excluded
them.
House Speaker John Boehner
(R-Ohio) touted the plan some-
what cautiously, saying it was
"far from perfect and we need
to do much more if we're serious
about creating new jobs."
In a posting on his website,
Boehner said the measure calls
for the largest non-military
spending cut in history and
would set the stage for a com-
panion vote later in the week on
a Republican budget to reduce
federal deficits by trillions of
dollars over the next decade.
The spending bill covering
the rest is fiscal year through
Sept. 30 is ticketed for a vote in
the House tomorrow, with the
Senate to follow either later in
the day or on Friday.
The product of days of brinks-
manship, the compromise gave
the White House, House Repub-
licans and Senate Democrats
enough to claim victory yet left
critics every opportunity to find
fault.
Overall the $38 billion in
cuts are less than the $61 bil-

lion contained in legislation the
House passed in February. Sen-
ate Democrats and the White
House initially advocated no
reduction from current levels.
The legislation includes cuts
for the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, the National Insti-
tutes of Health, community
health centers and the Commu-
nity Development Block Grant,
favored by mayors and other
local officials.
Yet the administration and
Senate Democrats succeeded in
blunting Republican demands
for even deeper reductions in
those programs and elimina-
tion of others. The deal pro-
tects some of President Barack
Obama's top priorities, leav-
ing Head Start untouched, for
example, while maintainingthe
maximum Pell education grant
of $5,550.
Two prominent conserva-
tives, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)
and Michele Bachmann
(R-Minn.) both said they would
vote against the legislation.
"I believe voters are asking
us to set our sights higher," said
Jordan, who chairs an organiza-
tion of House conservatives. He
said the group, the Republican
Study Committee, had called
earlier this year for $100 billion
in cuts, a total that far exceeds
the amount in the legislation.
Bachmann, a potential presi-
dential candidate, said on a
campaign-style trip to the first
caucus state of the 2012 cam-
paign that she was "very disap-
pointed with the bill that came
through. And that's an under-
statement."
In an appearance at a high
school in Pella, Iowa, she said,
"Voters expected us to defund
Obama-care," a reference to the
health care law that passed a
year ago.


D.C. Mayor arrested
in protest over budget

Gray analogized
D.C. situation to
popular uprisings
in Egypt, Libya
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
day after getting arrested with
other city leaders, the District
of Columbia's mayor called on
residents of the nation's capi-
tal to join him in protesting
likely new restrictions on the
city from Congress, drawing
analogies to this year's popular
uprisings in Egypt and Libya.
D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray
said yesterday that residents
should work through religious
groups and neighborhood
and civic associations to push
back against consequences for
Washington in the federal bud-
get Congress is expected to pass
later this week.
D.C. has its own city govern-
ment, but Congress ultimate-
ly oversees the city's affairs
including its budget and laws.
As a result, Gray and other city
leaders said that Washington
became a pawn in last week's
budget negotiations. It appears
that a deal members of Con-
gress reached Friday to avert a
federal government shutdown
included provisions that ban
the district from spending its
own, city-collected tax money
to pay for abortions for poor
women. The deal would also
re-establish a school voucher
program that has divided city
leaders.
Gray said he hoped that his
arrest Monday with 40 others,
including six members of the
District of Columbia Council,
would energize other residents.
On Monday, the mayor and oth-
ers sat down and blocked traffic
on Washington's busy Consti-

tution Avenue near the Capi-
tol before being arrested and
held until the early hours of
yesterday.
"I don't think there's any
doubt that we' got people's
attention," Gray said in an
interview in his office later
yesterday, still wearing a tag
from police on his wrist. "But
the reality is, too, that a single
event is not going to make a
lasting'difference. I think the
greatest value of this was to
be able to be a catalyst or to
be a spark for further involve-
ment."
Gray said he didn't have
any guarantees that activism
by citizens would work, but
he added that change comes
about when people get frus-
trated enough to take action,
making analogies to the civil
rights movement, the move-
ment to give women the right
to vote and recent events in
Egypt and Libya.
Gray acknowledged he has
no direct influence over the
federal budget process, but
he said the city's 600,000
residents could be a powerful
force. There was also some
suggestion Tuesday that
members of Congress and
even the White House took
notice of the protest.
White House spokesman
Jay Carney said during a
briefing with reporters that
the president does not sup-
port the provisions in the
budget that Gray has been
critical of but that, "in a nego-
tiation, you have to make
tough choices."
House Democratic Whip
Steny Hoyer of Maryland said
at a news conference that it
was unfortunate that the city
had been used as a bargaining
chip, but that the budget was
a compromise.

Toyota's success shows need for green innovation
With global climate change arguments still raging in poli-
tics and the general public, environmentalism in the
United States is in many ways far behind other nations.
In the U.S., the question continues to be "does global climate change
exist?" instead of "how can the process be slowed or undone?" Our
nation lags behind progressive European countries, which have been
placing strict energy mandates and lofty, impressive future goals.
One fact that liberals and conservatives agree upon, primarily from a
financial perspective, is that petroleum is not a viable energy source
for the future. It's a limited natural resource that cannot forever fuel
the nation's industrial, transportation and personal energy needs.

T here are moments that

my own crazyideas, my own
projects. These

moments disarm

my head that

American and foreign automakers have
begun to embrace alternative energy sources.
Hybrid and electric vehicles continue to take
larger market shares, threatening to eventu-
ally overtake their conventional gas-powered
counterparts. According to a company press
release, Toyota sold its one-millionth Prius
hybrid in the U.S. on April 5. Prius vehicles
have accounted for almost 60 percent of pas-
senger hybrid sales. This sales benchmark
clearly demonstrates that hybrid cars and
other alternatively powered vehicles have an
established market in the U.S. The public's
demand for hybrid vehicles like the Prius and
its forthcoming variants is an indicator that
environmental consciousness is catching on -
or people are anxious about the rising cost of
gasoline and looking for an alternative. As con-
sumers continue to support the hybrid market,
automakers can invest more in the research
and development of more efficient, next-gener-
ation technologies.
Several times a year, automakers show off
their latest designs and technologies in the
form of concept cars at auto shows, including
the successful North American International
Auto Show in Detroit. Concept cars are gener-
ally not intended for production - they draw
publicity for a company. In recent years, it has
become fashionable for automakers to out-

fit concept cars with the latest - and usually
unrealistic - hybrid, electric or fuel cell under-
pinnings. These innovative technologies rarely
become production vehicles. Automakers need
to go beyond paying lip service to alternatively
powered vehicles. They need to work on get-
ting inexpensive and more readily available
technologies on the road, and invest profits in
research and development, instead of spend-
ing money on concepts that are unrealistic to
implement. As several failed projects demon-
strate, this progressive attitude is risky. Auto-
makers, however, must take this risk in order
to stay on the path toward a sustainable future.
The European Union is moving to ban gas-
oline-powered vehicles by 2050. While the
political climate in America may not be con-
ducive to a similar policy, consumer demand
can put automakers on that path. As Prius and
other fuel-efficient vehicle sales demonstrate,
a growing demographic of the population is
ready to embrace environmentally friendly
technology. Hybrid and electric cars, such as
the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf, cannot
remain as mere novelties. The public must fully
embrace more efficient transportation options.
Consumer habits will reward companies that
are environmentally conscious and produce
innovative, green products that are affordable
for the average American family.

whose judgment I don't. I can sepa-
rate what I really want from what
others want for me or what I think
others expect from me. Whether I
act on this clarity depends on how
frequent these moments occur and
how strongly I hold on to them.
Human rights lawyer Jared Ger-
sner reminded me what real cour-
age is. So did blogger Donia Jarrar.
Author Chis van Allsberg reminded
me that I want to create something.
So did the three students who wrote
a musical. TEDx was a whole day
dedicated to these precious, elusive
moments.
For those who don't know, TEDx-
UofM inspired more than 1,700
people on Friday. I spent more than
12 hours listening and talking to
incredibly impressive individuals, all
of whom encouraged audience mem-
bers to pursue our own projects. I
brought my notebook and furiously
scribbled ideas down. Reading lists
were written. Dreams were etched.
What was so great about TEDx
was that it reminded me to stand
out when other influences pressure
me to fit in. There's a precedent for
advocating against the herd men-
tality. Philosopher John Stuart Mill
encouraged society to value eccen-

tricity because he believed there isn't
only one truth. There are multiple
truths, and the more we experiment
in lifestyle, the more we can learn
from each other. TEDx reminded
us - through examples of success -
that we, too, can and should pursue
our crazy ideas, even if the only ben-
efit, as van Allsberg said in his talk,
is to say that we did.
A completely student run event is
a crazy idea. Their phenomenal per-
formances show what can happen
when you put talented students from
diverse backgrounds together for a
common goal. There are more peo-
ple who would like to make amaz-
ing things happen. Some were in the
audience, some weren't.
At the reception following the
lectures, I realized I wasn't the only
one who was inspired. Some friends
and I talked about exciting things
we could do within our organiza-
tions and on our own. We kept build-
ing off each other's ideas, offering
enthusiastic support and feedback.
The energy was palpable.
But what will happen next week
when exams and papers consume
our minds? What will happen when
people tell us to be practical, and
playit safe? Will this rekindledbelief
in our abilities to make something
great happen fade?
My friends and I spoke about
this with some of the speakers and
organizers of the event for more
than an hour. How can we maintain
this community of students, profes-
sors and alumni who want to make
a big difference? Should it be orga-
nized formallyor should it continue
organically? How will we look back
at TEDx in a few months? Will we
see it as a genuine, perhaps revolu-
tionary, call to action? Or merely a
one-day performance?
TED is an institution that brought

all these people together so organic
thinking and innovation can be
illuminated. It didn't force creativ-
ity; it incentivized it. In his call to
action, Thomas Zurbuchen, noticed
the power of incentives. He asked,
"What idea will you pursue, right
now, that will lead you to speak at
next year's conference?"
Event should
inspire students
to take action.
other nudges can help. TEDx
acknowledged this by forcing appli-
cants to write down their crazy
ideas. This allowed them to select
the type of people they wanted and
encouraged students to have at least
one ambitious project in their head.
My friends and I spoke to the head
of TEDx San Diego who told us that
the audience organized follow-up
meetings so people could present
the projects they started after the
conference. People may be more
motivated to pursue something
when they know they will present
it to their peers, or they know other
people will work on something too.
These opportunities can, but don't
have to be, organized through the
TED name. other organizations can
also create spaces that offer these
moments and incentives.
The TEDxUofM team set up
nothing short of a spectacular show.
It gave us the moments. It's now our
turn totake advantage of them.

Shaping our automotive future

Every summer, students at universities
across the nation search for the perfect sum-
mer internship. They use it as a way to break
into their desired industry and gain career
experience. A summer internship can add a
lot of value to a student's resume, which helps
when applying for jobs their senior year. But
many students aren't lucky enough to snag
an internship in Chicago or New York, and
they're left wondering what to do with their
summer. So, how important is an internship?
The point of an internship is to gain expe-
rience in your desired field of work, but there
are other ways to do that aside from a summer
internship. There are many community ser-
vice jobs or programs held during the sum-
mer that can add value to your resume. When
employers look at a resume, they want to see
that a potential employee used their downtime
in the summer in an effective manner. Wheth-
er that includes a summer internship, a mis-
sion trip or another creative way to improve
your skills, that's what employers are looking
for. If you can talk about it in an interview and
make yourself stand out from the rest of the
crowd, then you've spent your time wisely.
But ifyour heart is set on interning at the top
fashion magazine or the biggest investment
bank on Wall Street, that's a very real possibil-
ity. There are a lucky few every year who land
paid internships at these companies and are
able to turn them into full-time job offers. But
these companies are increasingly using stu-
dents' desire to work for them as a way to gain
free labor. Many more internships are becom-
ing unpaid, yet students are still willing to take
them, even if it means going into debt to pay
for housing and food while interning.
Is this fair to the students who just want to
better themselves and learn more? Not neces-
sarily. We have a minimum wage in this coun-

try for a reason, but large corporations have
found a way around that. College interns are
being used as free labor. An April 2 article in
The New York Times states that 75 percent of
students enrolled in four-year colleges or uni-
versities in the U.S. willwork as interns at least
once before graduating. And of that 75 percent,
between 33 and 50 percent will go unpaid.
It's clear that many students are willing to
work for free, but this also means they lose
some governmental protection from laws
that prohibit racial discrimination and sexual
harassment.
So, are unpaid internships worth it? Many
students don't even have the option to work
in an internship for free. They wouldn't be
able to afford the expenses they would incur
over the summer. But many others can afford
to freely spend money while gaining valuable
work experience. These students are lucky.
They have the flexibility to take an unpaid job
and not worry about their personal finances.
But not everyone is in that situation.
It's unrealistic for me to ask every corpo-
ration to change its unpaid internships to
paid positions. However, companies need to
realize the work students are doing is valu-
able, and they're doing it in an effort to better
themselves.
To students, it's always valuable to gain
real-world experience, but it shouldn't be at
the price of putting yourself in debt. Students
should look at their own situation to decide
if they can take on an unpaid internship. But
they should also realize there are other expe-
riences out there that are just as valuable on
a resume, and they should explore alternative
options.

Several weeks ago, my jaw dropped. It wasn't because
University President Mary Sue Coleman finally returned
my calls - she still hasn't. It wasn't because I walked
into my dorm room to find its dankness hadsubsided - it
still smells like sweat, feet and sweaty feet (girls are into
that, right?). And it wasn't because I inexplicably lost
control of my jaw muscles - that was yesterday.
No, it was because of a post on an automotive blog.
Mid-March, Autoblog posted pictures of a BMW M3
pickup lapping the Ntrburgring, the infamous German
track. For auto industry junkies, this was nothing less
than epic. It's not every day that you see a 414-horsepow-
er mini-pickup. General Motors nearly got there with
the Pontiac G8 ST and an inevitable high-powered GXP
variant. Unfortunately for the six Americans who would
have purchased such an awesome - and awesomely
pointless - toy, Pontiac couldn't make the case for the
niche model in the face of bankruptcy and restructuring.
In my nerdy excited state, I didn't see the M3 pickup
for what it was: a weirdly early and expensive April Fools
prank pulled by the apparently jolly Bavarians at BMW.
At first I was embarrassed I fell for it, but then I ratio-
nalized my gullibility and decided to write a viewpoint
about it.
The automotive landscape is changing, even apart
from alternative power sources and fuels. Automakers
are increasingly taking design risks and exploring new
shapes that defy categorization. So even though it dif-
fered greatly from anything BMW has produced, an M3
pickup - or any new model for that matter - isn't off
the table, just like Ross and Rachel hooking up in that
one episode in which they realize it's never off the table.
BMW and Audi, especially, have had a recent pen-
chant for filling every niche possible, so much so that
they're running out of nomenclature. Along with sedans
and crossovers in every market segment, BMW attempt-
ed to create a new segment with the 5 Series Gran Tur-
ismo, an innovative sedan/crossover hybrid. Though it's
uglier, more expensive and less spacious than a 5 Series
station wagon, it demonstrates BMW's awareness that
consumers have diverse needs and aren't tied to stan-

dards. It appears to be working. While BMW works on
smaller variations of the Gran Turismo, other German
automakers are readying their rivals.
BMW also recently announced a new environmental-
ly friendly sub-brand, i. The company is already receiv-
ing criticism for it's decidedly "un-BMW" designs. A
break from the norm, however, is exactly what BMW
needs to adapt to an increasingly changing consumer
base. It's exploring, and even if it fails, isn't an effort to
innovate better than standingstill?
A surprising leader in the unconventional auto trend
is Nissan, which appears to be taking cues from Renault,
its radical French partner. This is most apparent in the
Murano CrossCabriolet, which recently went on sale.
Nissan took its Murano CUV, got rid of two doors and
chopped off the roof. The result: the first-ever produc-
tion convertible crossover. The CrossCabriolet is too
heavy, underpowered and expensive and certainly can't
be described as beautiful - but it's nonetheless awesome.
These Nissans and BMWs are not models that are
intended to fly out of dealerships at record pace. They
are successful attempts to humanize automakers. They
demonstrate that there is still a sense of whim in the auto
industry - after all, cars are supposed to be fun. BMW
made the M3 pickup to prove it had a sense of humor.
In the 80s and 90s, automotive designs became boring.
With new machinery to produce and revenue to invest,
automakers are starting to manufacture cars that excite
people and change their perception of what a car is. So
far, it's mostly foreign automakers challenging conven-
tions - Honda, Kia and even Ferrari come to mind. The
Big Three, especially Chrysler, must begin to take more
design risks:
Most importantly, this newfound exploratory attitude
is a signthat automakers aren't settling to build machines
that take us from point A to point B. They are reasserting
that cars are sculptures that we live our lives in, and art
is never finished. They're keeping me glued to my com-
puter, anxiously watching to see what's coming next.

ings," Burgess said. "It really
shows that (because of the)
50-year tradition that Michi-
gan has after Kennedy gave that
speech at 2 in the morning."
The idea for the Peace Corps
was first proposed by then-Sen-
ator John FKennedy in a speech
he delivered early in the mornng
of Oct. 14, 1960 on the steps
of the Michigan Union dur-
ing his presidential campaign.
The organization was formally
established by an executive
order, signed by Kennedy on
March 1, 1961.
Current Peace Corps par-
ticipants volunteer in 139 coun-
tries, according to a Peace Corps
press release issued yesterday.
The 25 University graduate
students involved in the Peace
Corps have volunteered in sev-
eral locations overseas such as
South Africa, Western Samoa
and Paraguay.
Burgess, who is a Peace Corp
Fellow, said the ranking reflects
the current status of the Uni-
REGISTRY
From Page 1A
in conjunction with the Univer-
sity.
A new travel registry website
was launched last November.
Godfrey said the previous sys-
tem was difficult to use and as a
result was seldom used, but the
new system has already proved
to be valuable after several
international crises this year.
"It is proving to be an extraor-
dinarily useful way for the Uni-
versity to understand and to
identify people who might need
assistance in some form from
the University," Godfrey said.
There were about 19 Univer-
sity-affiliated individuals in
Egypt at the time of the protests,
according to Godfrey. He said
the travel registry was helpful
in locating and assisting those
abroad in this situation and sev-
eral others.
Though cell phone service
was suspended throughout
Egypt for several days, Green
said Godfrey reached him on his
cell phone on Jan. 31, after ser-
vice was restored, to ensure his
safe travel out of Egypt.
While some of the students
in Egypt were listed in the

holding elections to elect a new
president and parliament.
For Israel, Aharoni said, these
developments will be the end of
the country's ongoing attitude of
denial toward the conflict.
"There's this gradual move
from silence to an understand-
ing," she told the audience.
"(There's) an acknowledgment
that September might be a turn-
ing point in regional politics."
Chief among Israel's priorities
is an effort to stop a proposal by
Western Europe that would see
the implementation of a two-
state solution, Aharoni said.

"We see Israel as beginning
to work on a diplomatic front to
stop this initiative," she said.
But Aharoni also pointed out
that Israelis tend to regard Pal-
estinian relations as similar to
confronting a natural disaster
and something that can't be over-
come.
"The idea of a Palestinian state
is conflated with natural disas-
ters like fires and earthquakes,"
Aharoni said. "The use of these
metaphors makes us think that
Israelis think about (Palestin-
ians) as something that's totally
out of control."
According to Aharoni, the
most likely outcome of the Sep-
tember resolution will be the
continuation of the conflict with-

versity's program. Burgess vol-
unteered in Paraguay educating
communities about environmen-
tal sustainability, according to
the University's International
Center website.
"We're continuing to have a
high number of recruits, a high
number of applicants, and I'm
very proud to be part of that
50-year legacy," Burgess said.
In addition to the graduate
school programs, 94 University
alumni are currently serving in
the Peace Corps in various plac-
es. The University ranks third on
the Peace Corps' list of top vol-
unteer schools in the country for
2011, and ranks fourth as a top
feeder school since the organiza-
tion's founding.
Burgess attributed the Univer-
sity's high number of volunteers
to the campus's strong emphasis
on community service.
"I think it really shows a high
level of character within the stu-
dents and an interest in interna-
tional service (and) an interest
in international development,"
Burgess said.
Rackham student Abby
Hyduke, who is a Peace Corp

Fellow studying in the School
of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment, said because she was
uncertain what she wanted to
study in graduate school, the Fel-
lows program was a good option
for her.
"I wanted to go and see part
of the world ... to know a differ-
ent place before deciding what
I really wanted to pursue,"
Hyduke said.
Hyduke, who spent her time
in the Peace Corps in Cameroon,
said she worked with local farm-
ers by teaching them how to the
implement farming techniques,
which helped them save money
and practice agriculture more
sustainably.
Hyduke said she enjoys the
program because, unlike most
theses, the fellows' projects have
the potential to be implemented
in underserved communities.
Hyduke added that her course
of study has been changed by her
experiences in the Peace Corps.
"I think I was more of a sci-
entist before, and now I see the
value of incorporating people
and social issues into a profes-
sional life," Hyduke said.

NORTH QUAD
From Page 1A
In response to the situa-
tion, the Stockwell Second Year
Experience programming board
passed an amendment last night
to restrict future funding to only
programs that affect avast major-
ity of residents.
LSA junior Andrew' Schantz,
chair of finance for the Multicul-
tural Council, said the service trip
had been a priority for the coun-
cil since the beginning of the year
because of North Quad's interna-
tional focus. Schantz added that
the money wasn't appropriated to
fund a vacation for students, but
instead to fund a service-based
trip that would allow participat-
ing residents to share their expe-
riences with students upon their
return.
"It's not like we're using this
money frivolously ..." he said.
"The day that they hit the ground
in Peru, they're going to be doing
service work at elementary
schools at Cusco. So it's not like
this is goingto be relaxing and lei-
surelytime for anybody. It's going
to be a lot of hard work."
Due to the reduction in partici-
pants and additional fundingfrom
the Michigan Student Assembly,
Residence Halls Association and
the Ginsberg Center, the Commit-
tee for International Impact - a
subcommittee of the North Quad
Multicultural Council - offered
to return some ofthe funding they
had initially requested from the
council, Schantz said.
The council also faced criticism
for voting on the allocation of
funds since several of the council
members were originally going to
go on the trip. However, the exec-
utive board members and repre-
sentatives of the Multicultural
Council who are participating
in the service trip decided it was
ethical to vote on the proposal to
grant funding for the trip after

discussing it with Hall Director
Laura Johnson, Schantz said.
"We felt that since the partici-
pants on the trip are residents in
the residence hall, and we pay the
same amount of money towards
the general fund that goes towards
the budget ... they had every right
to do so," Schantz said. "It seemed
unfair to take their vote away
from them if they are under the
same conditions. They paid those
dues like everybody else."
LSA sophomore Lauren Mul-
lins, co-chair of International
Impact, will no longer be partici-
pating in the service trip. She
wrote in an e-mail interview that
before voting on funding for the
trip, a vote was held to decide
whether those participating could
vote.
"This service trip is meant
to develop and advance North
Quad's theme community of
International Impact, so in my
mind, allocating funding for this
trip is benefiting more than just
the residents participating, it is
contributing to the residence hall
as a whole and promoting their
mission of affecting change on a
global issue," she wrote.
Because of the incident in
North Quad, members of the
Stockwell Second Year Experi-
ence board voted in favor of a res-
olution that would "look to fund
programs and events which will
positively affect a large number
of its residents."
Brendan Devlin, secretary of
the Stockwell Second Year Expe-
rience programming board, said
the amendment is similar to a
policy RHA already has in place.
David Guenther, executive
chair of the programming board
at Stockwell, said the board want-
ed to ensure a trip similar to that
ofNorth Quad wouldn'tbe funded
in their hall.
"I think that at least at the
RHA meeting, the representatives
seemed to lose focus on what their
roles are," Guenther said. "It's not

to do what you think is right, it's
to do what you think the residents
want."
University Housingspokesman
Peter Logan declined to com-
ment on the Stockwell program-
ming board's amendment until he
receives more information on the
proposal.
Though it isn't likely to be
enacted in other halls, Guenther
said he hopes Stockwell's amend-
ment encourages other represen-
tatives to adhere to the funding
policies.
"We hoped that this would
encourage restrictions on how
moneyis spent, and the (executive
board) has a large influence on
what happens, which they should,
but I feel like there should be more
regulation on how money is dis-
tributed," Guenther said.
LSA junior James Prender-
gast, a North Quad resident, said
though hall councils have a right
to use their funding asthey see fit,
allowing trip participants to vote
was unethical.
"I think it comes under the
realm of corruption when you're
allowed to vote on funding for
yourself," he said.
He added that he thinks fund-
ing should be cut even more since
residents' money is going to be
used to fund a trip for only a few
people.
"I think that only reducing it by
$500 is a slap inthe face," he said.
LSA sophomore Molly Spald-
ing, a resident of North Quad and
a trip participant, said she doesn't
understand whythere were prob-
lems with funding the trip, as it
had been a well-known goal to
fund the travels duringthe year.
"Since our theme is Interna-
tional Impact, the whole goal was
to fund, or partially fund, an inter-
national service trip," she said. "I
think everyone was aware of that
throughout the year.

Rackham student Eric Schewe,
weren't, which made evacuat-
ing them more difficult, God-
frey said. However, Godfrey
obtained Schewe's information
from his HTH Insurance poli-
cy. To make this process more
efficient, Godfrey said he wants
to synchronize insurance infor-
mation with the registry in the
future.
Schewe and his wife Val-
entine, a Ph.D. candidate at
Columbia University, were con-
ducting research in Cairo when
the protests began. Schewe said
Godfrey contacted him - the
only University graduate stu-
dent in Cairo at the time - and
coordinated with Columbia
University to have them evacu-
ated out of Egypt together on
Feb. 2.
After the couple left Egypt,
they spent three weeks with
family friends in London before
returning to work in Cairo.
Schewe, who is currently in
Cairo, said in an interview via
Skype that he is now listed on
the travel registry.'
"At the end of the day, we
were never really in direct dan-
ger," he said.
After a bus bombing in Jeru-
salem last month that killed one
out the two parties reaching an
agreement. Under this scenario,
Aharoni said, "both sides contin-
ue with what we know as unilat-
eral measures ... the conflict will
not end, it will transform."
Regardless of the outcome,
Aharoni said violence is unavoid-
able. The only question is how
much violence will occur, she
said.
The second panelist, Mark
Tessler, the Samuel J. Eldersveld
Collegiate Professor of Political
Science at the University, took a
different approach in discussing
the regional tension. He empha-
sized-how the recent uprisings in
places like Egypt and Libya could
have an impact on Israeli-Pales-
tinian relations.
As Tessler pointed out, the
Israeli-Palestinian issue isn't
a motivating factor of those
involved in the ongoinguprisings
in the Middle East.
"(For) the people who are
coming out in Egypt, Israel is not
part of the equation at all," Tes-
sler said.
However, despite Israel's non-
involvement in the developments
thus far, the uprisings in the
Middle East present an oppor-
tunity for Israel to take a stance
on the issue, which could have
repercussions on Israeli-Pales-
tinian relations, Tessler said.
"The question is, how should
Israel respond?" Tessler asked
the panel. "Is this a challenge or
an opportunity? Does it change

person and injured 30 others,
Godfrey said he heard back from
four University students study-
ing abroad in Israel within an
hour of the explosion because
of contact facilitated by having
the students' information in the
registry.
The travel registry also
allowed the University to reach
all students in Japan within a
few hours during last month's
earthquake, Godfrey said.
He said all students would
benefit from using the registry
as a lifeline in times of crisis.
Godfrey said he urges every
student to use the service when
traveling for University-related
business, personal pleasure or
otherwise.
Students may lose out on
assistance without the connec-
tion the registry provides to the
outside world, Miller said. He
added that students shouldn't
assume they don't need to use
the registry when traveling
to stable countries. Students
could end up in the hospital and
unable to arrange medical and
travel plans.
"You can't assume just
because you're going to a place
that seems politically stable and
all of that (that) you'll be safe,"
Miller said.
things in a fundamental sense?"
According to panelist Victor
Lieberman, the Marvin B. Beck-
er Collegiate Professor of His-
tory at the University, the recent
revolts and the Palestinians'
push for statehood each spell
trouble for Israel. The resigna-
tion of former Egyptian Presi-
dent Hosni Mubarak may lead
to the emergence of latent anti-
Israel sentiment that Mubarak's
regime suppressed, he said.
"Democracy in Egypt will cre-
ate a larger space for (anti-Israe-
li) voices to be heard than was
the case when Mubarak was in
power," Lieberman said.
Accordingto Lieberman, "The
Arab world at large ... is pushing
for a more principled anti-Israel
position."
But Lieberman said he
believes the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict can only be settled by an
external force.
"The Palestinians won't
accept any concessions," Lieber-
man said. "I don't see how the
situation will stabilize with-
out external intervention from
America."
In an interview after the
meeting, LSA junior Dafna Eis-
bruch, an executive board mem-
ber of J Street UMich, said she
was pleased with the diversity of
opinions expressed at the panel.
"I was really grateful to the
panelists for putting some seri-
ous analysis into the prompts we
gave them," Eisbruch said.

United for'Solidaridad'

"Fifty more of these and I've got the corner office."
Worse than work

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
Comedy Central needs to leave slack-
er office-comedies to the pros. While
"Workaholics" describes itself as a story
about three room-
mates fresh out of col-
lege coping with adult
life, the series pre- Workaholics
miere, "Piss & S**t," is
little more than a lame Pilot
attempt to recreate Wednesdays
the Mike Judge film at10:30 p.m.
"Office Space," only Comedy Central
more frat boy and less
mid-life crisis.
The Internet sketch comedy group
Mail Order Comedy has come up with
"Workaholics," a 10-episode series star-
ring Blake Anderson, Anders Holm and
Adam DeVine ("Traffic Light") as ...
Blake, Anders and Adam. They proudly
portray life after graduation as a daily
struggle to score drugs, wake up before
noon and keep from moving back in with
Mom. Though this maybe a strong setup,
a proper plot is also required, which the-
oretically shouldn't be too hard.
Yet the pilot concerns itself with
piss. The telemarketing firm where the
titular characters work requires a drug
test of all employees and, big surprise,
they're not clean! Disregarding the
fact that an office drug test seems a tad
ridiculous, watching three grown men
search for clean urine quickly becomes
grotesque. The gag of throwing urine in
someone's face is funny the first time,
sort of. But by the second and third try
it's time to return to the drawing board
(i.e. think of some real jokes!).
This isn't to say there are no redeem-
ing qualities to the show. The opening
party sequence features some qual-
ity hijinks, reminiscent of Judd Apa-
tow comedies like "Knocked Up" and
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall." However,
these movies relegate their crude humor
to the background, using it as a setup for
more emotionally heartfelt fare - Seth

Rogen matures and becomes a father,
while Jason Segel falls in love with the
girl of his dreams. Even the true slack-
ers of Judge's cult classic, which helped
pave the way for misguided office work-
ers everywhere, manage to learn a life
lesson or two.
The only time the episode gains any
real traction is a relatively clever ref-
erence to "Die Hard." While climbing
through a vent in an effort to circum-
vent the drug test, Anderson gives his
best Bruce Willis impression suitable for
TV censors - "Yippie Kai Yay mother-
cluckers." These kinds of pop culture
allusions should comprise a show geared
largely toward college-aged viewers.
"Workaholics" appears to be strad-
dling two worlds: the stoner genre and
workplace situation comedy. Properly
executed, a synthesis of the two could
be excellent and even garner the ever-
profitable 18-49 demographic. Unfortu-
nately, what we're given doesn't evolve
much beyond a sketch from the Mail
Order Comedy website - perhaps this is
where the show belongs.
'Workaholics'
anonymous.
In other words, the jump from Inter-
net to scripted series was premature.
"Workaholics" warrants about eight
minutes of the viewer's attention - and
this would be a hilarious eight minutes,
mind you, complete with just the right
amount of blunt references.
One should expect better from
Kevin Etten. The executive producer
of "Scrubs" perfected schoolmates-
turned-new co-workers - Turk and
J.D. are clearly old roommates, but they
evolve and are real people, demonstrat-
ing that post-college life can, and should
be, more than an endless stream of dick
jokes and drug montages.

Latin@ Cultural Show
to bridge communities
in 11th presentation
By JACOB AXELRAD
DailyArts Writer
Combining musicians, singers, danc-
ers and activists from across campus, as
well as the greater Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti communities, the
Lydia Mendelssohn
Theatre will feature
"Solidaridad," the ith Tonight at
annual Latin@ Culture 7 P.M.
Show, today at 7 p.m. ssohn
From spoken-word Theatre
poetry to Cuban skate
culture, the show aims Free
to present Latino cul-
ture as stemming from an inclusive, mul-
tidimensional identity.
The driving force behind "Solidari-
dad" is the unity of different Latino
groups, both on campus and off. Accord-
ing to LSA senior and event co-coordina-
tor Frances Medina, this participatory
vision breaks with more traditional roles
the show has previously taken.
"The past years were really focused
on Latino history," Medina said. "But
this year is about bringing the com-
munity together and getting different
Latino organizations on campus to work
together."
What began 11 years ago in the base-
ment ofthe Michigan League hassteadily
blossomed into an umbrella organization
for University Latino culture.
Just as participation and interest have
continually increased, so too have the
show's goals. This year, in keeping with
the theme of solidarity, the planning
committee - known as the Core - has
reached out to fellow Latino groups in the
surrounding area.
"There's a pretty big Latino population
in Washtenaw and Ypsilanti. As part of
our mission we need to be including these
neighboring communities," said LSA
senior and event co-coordinator Carla
Fernandez-Soto. "We're trying to create
a greater coalition of Michigan Latinos."

FILE PHOTO/Daily

The 2009 culture show featured a hardcore salsa band.

Fernandez-Soto and Medina both
view the event as a platform for social
justice in addition to being a celebration
of culture and heritage. Groups like One
Michigan, a youth-led immigrant rights
organization from Detroit, will speak and
share personal experiences about what
it means to be. descended from undocu-
mented immigrants.
As opposed to campus clubs like the
Latino Student Organization that dedi-
cate themselves to stopping injustice
plaguing Latinos at home and at large,
the organizers of the Latin@ Culture
Show broach these topics through the
performing arts.
"It's a more relaxed venue," Medina
said. "It's separate from having to fight
every day for issues that really affect us
on a personal level."
Issues like the recently controversial
Dream Act, the bill that would provide
conditional permanent residency to
immigrant high school graduates, serve
as motivation to create a safe venue for
people who identify with and feel affect-
ed by problems in the Latino community
tocome together.
"The students that can't go to the Uni-
versity because they're undocumented
... it affects their lives tremendously and
they're part of our family in a way," Medi-
na explained.

While the message is one of cohesive-
ness, teaching audience members about
the varied ethnic, racial and regional
Latin American backgrounds is also a key
facet of the show. According to Medina,
only in the U.S. do people from Mexico
and Guatemala identify under the same
blanket term "Latino."
A collaborative effort from the start,
the planning process - which began in
December - depends on time and dedi-
cation from the students involved. The
majority of the show's acts are entirely
student-run and student-initiated.
"Most acts come about because stu-
dents come to us with an idea, we usu-
ally love it and we just run with it,"
Fernindez-Soto said.
Students from differing backgrounds
will pay homage to Central America,
South America and the Caribbean with
acts like Salsa dancing and Afro-Cuban
drumming.
From University professors to the
Alberto Rojo Trio, a local Ann Arbor
group, the Latin@ Cultural Show is a
labor of love, running the gamut from
entertainment to educational.
"(The show) is a home away from
home, not just for members of the Latino
community, but for anyone who feels
some form of connection to these issues
affecting Latinos," Medina said.

'Breaking' disassembled

By KELLY ETZ
Daily Arts Writer
"BreakingIn"should be better. Itstarts
with a promising concept - an off-the-
wall workplace comedy in which a team
of super-skilled hack-
ers break into compa-
nies to test security
systems - but there is Breaking In
little to like about the
grasping pilot. The Pilot
viewer knows where
jokes are supposed to Wednesdays
be, but the laughs just at 9:30 p.m.
aren't there. FOX
The plot, though
based on an interesting idea, is question-
able at best. There is a certain degree of
incredulity that just can't be ignored. A
remote control toy helicopter navigating
its way through crisscrossed lasers and
managing to swipe a card to gain securi-
ty access? Nobody's buying it. It isn't even
particularly exciting. Breaking into a car
dealership and stealing a silver Lambo-
rghini shouldn't be so easy, but for this
team it's not even cause to break a sweat.
The entire 30 minutes of the pilot
feels contrived. The show is definitely
trying too hard, and yet is succeeding at
very little. But it moves at such a fast clip,
it's hardly noticeable. The pilot flies by,
jumping from scene to scene in a chaotic
mess. When the end arrives, it's hard to
know whether to be confused or relieved.
And the characters prove to be even
less interesting than the plot. The head-
liner, Christian Slater ("Interview with
a Vampire"), does what Christian Slater
does best - fall flat. It's unclear wheth-
er his character Oz, the head of Contra
security, is crashing and burning because
of his acting or the campy writing. And
his apparent catchphrase, "I'll allow it,"
is eye-rollingly annoying.
At least the show has the promising
Bret Harrison, who shined in his former

role as Satan's reluctant assistant on the
short-lived series "Reaper," as the focus.
However, he's been unfortunately type-
cast once again as the slightly awkward
underachiever who's in love with an out
of his league brunette. Harrison should
have perfected the character type bynow,
but his portrayal of Cam borders on tired.
The rest of the team is rather unre-
markable. The only secondary cast mem-
ber who displays any kind of promise is
Josh (Trevor Moore, "The Whitest Kids
U'Know"). He manages to pull a laugh
or two but goes over the top by using
phrases like "multi-assing" instead of
"multi-tasking" and actually referring to
his bicep as a "gun rack."
Bale has Batman,
Slater has ...
But there might be something here.
With as short a runtime as pilots
often have, there isn't enough time for
"Breaking In" to establish anything. In
future episodes, there's always the hope
that the show will gain its footing, work
through its kinks, fix Slater's acting and
come out as a decent option. With how
quickly the pilot speeds, it can hardly
count as an episode at all. If "Break-
ing In" can make the effort to focus
on the quality - rather than the quan-
tity - of both the acting and the jokes,
something brilliant may come out of the
unfortunately lackluster pilot.
Will it be another workplace comedy
gem like "The Office?" No. Will it even
make it through a decent first season?
We'll see. But it's too soon to give up on
"Breaking In"just yet. Give it till the next
episode and if that one is just as bad, then
forget it. But it's worth sticking around
until then, just to be sure.

Students go to the library to study, but
sometimes a few short Facebook or snack
breaks are necessary. Recently, there has
been a more produc-
tive and eye-catching ps and
study break option for
students, faculty and Spaces:

ate Library. Until May Through
24, the library's gallery May 24
will host the traveling
exhibit "Places and Hatcher Graduate
Spaces: Mapping Sci- Library
ence," a collection of Free
60 conceptual and lit-
eral maps along with interactive stations
and child-friendly sections.
The exhibit is organized by "itera-
tions," each one a set of 10 maps. Every
year, a new iteration centered around
its own theme is added to the collection.
The University is the first to host this
exhibit, with its new sixth iteration from
2010, for a grand total of 60 maps.
Rebecca Hill, local exhibit curator
and assistant librarian for the Shapiro
Science Library, said she has seen a lot
of students stopping by the exhibit and
become lost in its colors and organiza-
tion. She noticed students would try to
get glimpses of the maps even-before the
exhibit was fully set up.
For Hill, "Places and Spaces" has a
twofold appeal, to those who are focal-

"My movie is basically about the strug-
gle that surrounds the creative process,
and the doubts of the artist," Huang said.
"It's very personal, and the main charac-
ter basically represents me, soI spent alot
of time trying to work through my own
thoughts and what I was feeling when I
made it."
To expedite the production process,
the students had to get help from profes-
sionals all over the University. For her
movie musical, Huang drew fromsources
outside of the SAC department, going
to the Department of Music, Theatre &
Dance for set pieces, singers and more.
Similarly, Mendel spoke with engineer-
ing technicians who guided him through
the process of proper 3-D imaging.
"Because 3-D film technology is rela-

ized in the sciences and to those who
find interest in science but don't have a
large grasp of it.
"It's a really great way to kind of get,
science across to people," she said. "Peo-
ple think 'science' and automatically
think it's very dry - that it's lab work
and numbers. But with the maps, they
can see the history of science and more."
It's natural to think maps can only
show locations, but this exhibit chal-
lenges that notion and goes far beyond
the traditional, with maps ranging from
actual locations on the planet to men-
tal and conceptual maps as well. A few
examples include a map showing man-
kind's ecological footprint on the plan-
et, a map showing where the plots of
world famous novels are set and others
representing concepts like well-being
or potential disease outbreaks, all based
on research.
Hatcher Library
hosts 'Places.'
Tim Utter, a local exhibit curator and
access and information services librar-
ian, said the interdisciplinary nature of
the display attracts even more interest
from people only slightly interested in
dazzling maps.
"That's one thingthat's really unusu-
al is that the maps show different ways
to communicate data or information,"
tively new, there's no school that teaches
you how to utilize it," Mendel said. "The
hardest part of prepping the thesis was
learning the ins and outs of the new
medium."
Mendel refers to his thesis, "Train of
Shadows," as a "flashy business card" that
promotes his new 3-D venture, Giant Eel
Productions. The surreal dreamscapes
featured in "Train" represent his pure
artistic vision, and he thinks that short
films in the vein of the Honors thesis are
a perfect medium for that kind of expres-
sion.
"There's not much of a market for short
films, so it was a lot easier for us to focus
solely on the aesthetics," Mendel said.
But these students also recognize the
important balance between relevance
and artistry.
"There's definitely a film school bub-
ble," Kaye said. "If you're too immersed
in it, you start to make films that appeal

Utter said. "You could be showing data
in a table, and that's one way to display
information. But for me, because I'm
much more visual, if someone makes an
interesting map, that's easier for me to
understand."
One creative map on display was
produced by a Ph.D. student in order to
explain his proposal for a doctoral the-
sis. Using subway tubes to connect his
thoughts, the student was able to map
out his ideas in order for his advisor to
understand his goal and later approve
of the topic.
With this student's map as an exam-
ple, Utter said maps can tell more than
a person's current location - if done
right, they can tell a story.
"People remember stories," he said.
"Someone tells you a story and that's
what you remember. If someone gives
you a statistic, it's hard to really remem-
ber that. These maps work that way -
like stories."
The exhibit is designed to encourage
contemplation and show its spectators
the variety of ways of combining dif-
ferent schools of thought and forms of
communicating information.
"It's fun," Uttersaid. "It's interesting,
it's stimulating and it's a great opportu-
nity to see an important international
type exhibit that's here in town."
Students may now consider stopping
by the gallery exhibit the next time they
have some free time or feel the need to
take a break from their 10-page paper
they're viciously working on at the
library.
only to that audience."
Kaye's film "Slash Fiction" is a comedy
about a conservative library that gets a
unisex bathroom. It explores how people
behave under the cloak of anonymity. To
keep her films coherent, Kaye relies on
her sister to read through the scripts and
tell her what works and what doesn't.
Nevertheless, the thesis students take
most of the burden upon themselves,
accordingto Huang.
"Some of us are directors, cinema-
tographers, set designers, everything in
between," she said. "It's a lot of work."
After tomorrow's affair, the SAC hon-
ors seniors have high hopes for the pos-
sibility of exposure and opportunities for
future work.
"I've heard a lot of fantastic Cinderella
stories about the festival circuit," Kaye
said. "I feel like, for most of us, this is one
of the biggest projects we've done in our
entire lives."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Hoke and Mattison have D' improving this spring

There were a lot of ques-
tions to be answered that
Monday afternoon, and
the Michigan defense's unofficial
spokesman was clearly baffled by
the truth himself.
Ryan Van
Bergen stood
in the hallway
at the Junge
Champions
Center, hav-
ing already
withstood
more than
five minutes TIM
of inquiry. ROHAN
And he had to
keep talking
about it - Michigan's 48-28 loss
against Wisconsin.
What was it like during that
second half when the Badgers
called one pass play during the
final 30 minutes of the game?
How could Wisconsin - already
missing John Clay - rush for
357 yards?
What happened?
As a student of the game, Van
Bergen had already watched the
tape - he was just disgusted
with what he saw.
Van Bergen and his team-
mates knew what Wisconsin
was going to do. The Wolverines
had practiced against the play
the entire week. That Saturday,
Wisconsin kept running it.
The same damn play.
They bullied the Michigan
defense until it said uncle.
Watch the film for yourself.
The guard on the backside of the
play pulls to the strong side and
the entire line pushes downfield
- it has many names, but Brady
Hoke and Al Borges call it the
"power" play.
Ironically, that's going to be
an important part of the Michi-
gan offense this season.
As for the defense, this spring
has Van Bergen and the rest of.
the unit ready to make some big
changes - starting with the lit-
tle things. If you piece together
the evidence from this spring,
the defense will be significantly

better this fall, thanks to the
two coaches at the top. And you
can guarantee, with Hoke and
Greg Mattison around, that and
no team will bully the defense
around.
"We will hit as much as any
team hits," Mattison said. "And
that'll be our trademark before
we're done."
No way anyone's going to
push Michigan around in 2011 -
not when Michigan has its big-
gest and best defensive players
on the defensive line. Not with
Hoke challenging the unit every
single day, expecting more of
them than anyone else.
The former defensive line
coach holds Mike Martin, Van
Bergen, Will Campbell and
Craig Roh to higher standards.
And they're the first line of
defense. The first one's who get
a chance to get after the football.
Michigan is going to be the bully
this fall.
"The defense will be slightly
more aggressive," Van Bergen
said. "We'll put more people in
the box and are more inclined to
bring the pressure on third-and-
long than we might've been in
the past.
"There's definitely a change in
attitude that we're going to get
after people and take our shots
when we get a chance."
No more sitting back and
getting manhandled. Hoke and
Mattison want their guys to
throw the first punch, to be the
aggressors. That's why tech-
nique and fundamentals are
being shoved down the defense's
throat this spring:
Blow delivery - "Everything
in defense starts with delivering
a blow," Mattison says - escap-
ing blocks, shedding blocks and
getting to the football, which
was sorely missed last season.
And if the 2010 Wolverines
did shed a block, they probably
missed the tackle.
"We've got to teach stance,"
Mattison said. "We've got to
teach alignment. We've got to
teach punch. We've got to teach

Fifth-year senior Ryan Van Bergen (right) says the difference between last year and this year for the Michigan defense will b

tackling.
"And that's how great defens-
es become great again. You do
that so you can run to the foot-
ball."
No one's cutting corners,
either. Mattison lives by the
motto that, "It's going to be per-
fect, or it's not good enough."
On Tuesday, Van Bergen men-
tioned the sense of urgency that
everyone on the team feels. They
need to get up to speed, and then
they need to get better while the
whole Big Ten builds off what it
did a year ago.
As evidence, look no further
than the resurgence of the prod-
igal son, Will Campbell. He was
lost, gone to the offensive side
of the ball, probably wasting a
unique skill-set that talent eval-
uators saw when they slapped
him with that five-star recruit
label. This spring, he's worked

hard and Hoke says he will cer-
tainly have an impact this fall.
Van Bergen said Campbell
has an improved work ethic and
attitude this time around. He's
putting in the extra time, paying
attention to details and improv-
ing on a daily basis. And, the
best part? Campbell has been
coachable - everyone's listening
and improving this spring.
As Hoke and Mattison are
testing the defense, the coaches
can hold it accountable too. No
longer is Michigan handcuffed
by a lack of experience.
Take a quick look at the very
unofficial depth chart: there are
the big names like Martin, Roh,
Van Bergen; Kenny Demens and
Cam Gordon at linebacker; and
Troy Woolfolk, J.T. Floyd and
Jordan Kovacs in the secondary.
And the key is the depth
behind all of these veterans.

Hoke wants his whole team to
play with a toughness - and he
said the seniors are leading by
example in that way.
Van Bergen's one of them.
And he and the rest of the class
don't have much time left.
There's only one year left to turn
it around.
Hoke's personally seeing to
it. As Rich Rodriguez would
spend time with the offense,
Hoke's fingerprints are leaving'
marks all over this defense. He
puts pressure on the defense in
practice situations. During Sat-
urday practices, he simulates the
game-day experience and lets
the players figure their problems
out on their own.
That would've been nice
against Wisconsin last fall.
Ever since Michigan Athletic
Director Dave Brandon declared
he wanted the ball boys to be

e its new agressive attitude.
defensive-minded, the fate of
the Michigan football team has
been redirected. It's a transfor-
mation on defense that has been
occurring this spring - as Mat-
tison slows down his defensive
install to teach the younger play-
ers the fundamentals and make
sure everyone understands the
plays before they move on to the
next set.
That's a journey that has
started this spring and could
end this fall.
At practice on Tuesday, after
the defense had completed a
drill, the entire unit gathered in
a huddle, with one arm raised.
"We're getting better every
day, 'D,"' one voice exclaimed.
And it sounded like he truly
meant it.

9-21 overall) didn't stop after
the first inning either, scoring a
season-high 13 runs en route to
a 13-3 rout.
"It's huge," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "Now what
you have, after a game like that,
is you start feeling a little more
confident and relaxed a little bit,
instead of feeling so tight. It's
hard when you're going through
a tough funk for a long period of
time, so it's nice to see them as
a whole team. A lot of different
guys got hits today and that's
encouraging."
Bowling Green (5-4 MAC,
11-17) opened the game with a
walk, before Andrew Kubus-
ki's single was misplayed by
freshman rightfielder Michael
O'Neill, which scored the lead
runner and allowed Kubuski to
take third. He later scored on a
sacrifice fly.
The Wolverines instant-
ly responded with hits from
seven of their first eight hitters.

team wasn't
exactly bursting with excite-
ment.
But the Wolverines (5-1 Big
Ten, 36-3 overall) avoided a let-
down, jumping on the Broncos
from the beginning to earn an
easy 6-1 victory.
"Itold them before the game,
'Don't play the opponent,'
because the mid-week game
against non-rivals is just harder,"
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
said Tuesday.
"But just play with your Mich-
igan pride and your passion, and
I thought we did a pretty good
job with it today because I've
seen our energy be better but
I've seen itbealot worse."
Sophomore right-hander
Stephanie Speierman (17-0)
got the win pitching five strong
innings, giving up just four hits
and a walk. The sole run she
allowed was unearned.
"I came out, just working
on getting better," Speierman
said. "That's the goal the whole
season, to be the best at the
end of the season ... There were
moments where I was a little bit
wild, and I was able to recognize
that I'm not that focused on this
one pitch, and I think I was able
to do a good job getting back to
that one-pitch focus."
Michigan's best hitting per-
formance came from the bat
of freshman left fielder Nicole
Sappingfield, who went 3-for-4
while scoring a run and tallying
two RBI.
"I just think that everything
just kind of started to work,"
Sappingfield said.
"I practiced my hitting a lot
yesterday, trying to get the ball
on the ground, and it just worked
today."
In the first inning, junior cen-

ter fielder and leadoff hitter Bree
Evans got things started for the
Wolverines. She scored after
junior third baseman Amanda
Chidester reached on a fielder's
choice.
Michigan added two more
runs in the second inning - one
coming on an RBI-single from
Sappingfield - and three more
in the fourth.
Chidester finished 0-for-2, but
she recorded two RBI. The Wol-
verines had 10 hits in the game,
leaving eight runners on base.
"It's really nice to have the
run support," Speierman said.
"But even in the games where
we aren't scoring runs, I trust
that they're'gonna get it done on
offense. So, if we don't have any
runs, it's just a matter of time
and I just have to keep the team
in the game."
Still, the Broncos (4-4 MAC,
10-24) didn't produce much
offense.
They left five runners on
base, but Speierman was perfect

through three innings and, out-
side of a rocky three-hit fourth
inning, Western Michigan's bats
were stifled.
After five innings, junior left-
hander Hilary Payne relieved
Speierman. And in just her sec- a

Payne was impressive.
She struck out three in just
two innings and allowed just one
Bronco to reach base.
"I thought Hilary (Payne) did
a great job," Hutchins said. "I
was really pleased." W
Hutchins was able to go deep
into the bench in the non-con-
ference tilt, playing six reserves. W
Despite the inexperience on the
field, the Wolverines never let
Western Michigan make a come-
back.
"I told them after the game
that some of those kids don't
get to play a lot, so go in there
and get after it," Hutchins said.
"It's nice to give them a chance
to play, and it's not like it was a
giveaway game, it was a game."

and molding it."
Chundu, a screen arts and culture major, has directed several films,
including "Camp Chapel," in which a high school student is sent to Bible
camp for spring break as punishment, and "Appleville," a comedic drama
in which a bus of elderly mall patrons becomes the center of a heist.
"Camp Chapel" premiered over the summer at the Traverse City Film
Festival and "Appleville" opened in late March in Detroit.
Chundu said being a part of those two projects are his proudest
accomplishments because it allowed him to put theory to practice and
collaborate with fellow student filmmakers.
"You spend a lot of time in classes learning and taking blue books, and
it's cool to put it all together, and you make your best friends there," he
said.
Chundu directed "Appleville" over the summer in Ann Arbor and
Detroit as a part of the Michigan Creative Film Alliance, a program in
which students from the University of Michigan, Wayne State Univer-
sity and Michigan State University work together to produce films.
After graduating this spring, Chundu plans to move to Los Angeles to
look for a job in the film industry.
"I'd like to continue working in movies and working in production
and exploring that - working all the different positions," Chundu said.
"I think it would be really fun. I'm obsessed with movies."

random student interview by stephen ostrowski

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred.
Why don't you start off by tell-
ing me what your summer plans
are?
Um, my summer plans are going
to work at a canoe livery on the
Huron River.
Oh cool. How'd you get that?
I just applied on A2.gov.
Are you a canoe enthusiast?
What drew you to that?
Just the outdoor line of work. Last
summer I worked at a ski resort in
Park City, Utah, soI like working
outdoors.
Oh cool. Would you call yourself
extreme?
'd like to be extreme, but I'm not
too extreme. Amateur extreme.
What's the most extreme thing
you've ever done?
Um, I don't know. Gone skiing out
West.
Cheetos, I think, have been
described as extreme. Extreme-
ly cheesy or something.
One time Iate an entire bag of
Cheetos when I was really high.
Just because it won't show up in
the recording, give me a sense of
the size of this bag.
About this big.

Can you quantify the bag? How
tall? A foot?
Two feet.
Wow.
It was cheese puffs, too.
So it wasn't Cheetos?
Cheeto brand cheese puffs.
That is really extreme. So would
you say your summer's going to
be like - comparing it between
movies - "Jane Eyre" or the
"Hangover Part II?"
What was the first one?
"Jane Eyre. "
"Hangover Part II" because Bill
Clinton's in that.
Which "Hangover" character
would you say you're most like?
Um, I'd like to say Bradley Cooper.
Why Bradley Cooper?
Because he's the best looking and
often time takes on the leader role.
If you had to choose between
being the portly man with a
beard who travels in the wolf
pack, or the man who inadver-
tently marries a stripper who
looses a tooth, who would you
describe yourself as?
Uh, the portly man with a beard.
Have you ever acted likea portly
man ... with a beard?
No. I've always bordered - I've
never actually reached portly yet
-I've bordered between out of
shape and like slightly chubby,
and I've never had a beard. I just
shaved today actually, and I
had what like he has (points to
friend). Just a little bit more than
stubble, I'd say. I've never tried to
grow an actual beard.
Has it been a struggle for you?
No I don't know. I'll wait until
I'm an older man to grow a beard.
Hold onto my youth.
Does anybody in your family
bald, speaking of holding onto
your youth?
I've been thinking about that alot.
None of them are early balders. So
I'm glad about that. ButI mean my
grandpa's bald, and he's about 70.
Let's shift to politics. Are you a
political enthusiast?

I watch pretty much every episode
of "The Daily Show" and "The Col-
bert Report," but that's about it.
Do you prefer Colbert or Stew-
art?
Stewart. Stewart for sure.
Why Stewart?
He's more of a gentleman. He's
a really talented TV host and
comedian, whereas Colbert is
really funny because of that whole
persona thing and he can be more
ridiculous, but Stewart overall just
runs a tighter show.
Did you know Donald Trump is
running for president? Are you
exited or depressed?
I didn't take it seriously - is it 100
percent for sure? I didn't take it
seriously until I saw the roasting.
He basically just sprung iton me.
I heard The Situation bombed
at the roast.
Yeah it was awful.
Was it good or bad?
He actually managed to, (on) one
or two jokes, manage to not get a
single laugh.
Tell me your best Donald
Trump joke.
I don't have any Donald Trump
jokes. I'm not a hack.
Do you think Rebecca Black
deserves all the criticism she's
been getting?
Uh, criticism. Yeah. I think she
deserves her fame too, though.
If you had to make a song about
the day of week, which day of
the week and can you give me a
few hooks?
Hmm ... I couldn't give you any
hooks. But I'd probably go for - I
mean, she's already got Friday,
and there's already been a couple
about Saturday already, so I'd
probably try Tuesday or Thurs-
day. Something random.
What's great about Tuesday
and Thursday?
Hmm ... They probably get passed
by. Nobody really thinks about
them. There's probably something
you could do something with. I
don't know. I mean I love "Fri-

day." I sing it every Friday.
Yeah? Nice. So back to the
Donald, because I'm intrigued.
He's been calling for President
Obama's birth certificate. What
are your thoughts on that?
I mean that's really stupid. It's
clear that President Obama has
a birth certificate. Honestly, he
really doesn't have a shot to win
the presidency. The only reason
he's getting so close is everyone's so
concerned about the fiscal situation
of the country, and he's supposed to
be a fiscal genius.
Who would you want to see in
the White House?
Obama.
Are you on Twitter?
I don't have a Twitter. I find myself
going on Twitter.
Who do you follow on Twitter?
Questlove, Tyler the Creator from
odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them
All. That's about it. Just members
of Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill
Them All.
Do you follow Earl?
Does he have a Twitter? No, Earl
doesn't have a Twitter.
What are your thoughts on Earl?
Free fucking Earl. Earl's the best
16-year-old rapper that ever -
I mean, Lil' Bow Wow had a
quite a run.
Yeah I don't know. I'm pretty sure
Earl trumps him.
Trumps - see, you're thinking
about the Donald. Now this is
ridiculous: Did you know Snooki
has more followers on Twitter
than the Dalai Lama? I think I
read that somewhere.
That makes sense, the Dalai Lama
really shouldn't have a Twitter.
There's something weird about
that.
That's interesting. Last ques-
tion: Have you filled out your
teacher evaluations yet?
No. There's no teacher I feel really
strongly enough this semester.
Justin is an Art &
Design sophomore.

news in review
Five of the most talked-about stories of the week, ranked in ascending order of actual importance

Acclaimed film director Sidney
Lumet died on Saturday at age
86. Lumet, who never received an
Oscar for direction but received
an honorary Academy Award in
2005, worked on famous films "12
Angry Men" and "Network."

An explosion in a Minsk, Belarus
subway station claimed 11 lives
and injured more than 100 people
during rush hour on Monday.
President Aleksandr Lukashenko
suggested that the blast was an act
of terrorism.

Opposition forces captured former
Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo
on Monday. Gbagbo, who has been
decried as a war criminal, refused
to relinquish power to the recog-
nized victor of last year's presiden-.
tial election, Alassane Ouattara.

On Tuesday, Japanese officials
increased the severity level of the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Station radiation leak from 5 to 7
- the most severe level for a crisis.
The Cheronbyl disaster in 1986
also received this rating.

France introduced a law on Mon-
day that bans wearing full face
veils in public. France is the first
European country impose the ban.
Individuals who violate the law will
be fined $216 and must attend a
"citizenship course."

Some things on campus are rare: heat waves. George Clooney sightings. Rich
Rodriguez fan clubs. And the list wouldn't be complete, of course, withou'
the proverbially marginalized "mullet" hairstyle.
But there's one relatively recent documentation of this 80s fad seeing the light
of day: Back in 2007, University student Stephen Krause snagged a headline for his
Bowie-like 'do ("Campus Characters: The Man Behind the Mullet," 2/15/2007).
As The Michigan Daily reported, the then-Engineering sophomore had been a
mullet enthusiast from an early age: "(Krause)has had the same hairstyle since he
was 6 years old. His smooth, blond hair is cut about an even inch, except above the
nape of his neck, where the hair flows past his shoulders."
Athough Krause - appropriately nicknamed "Mullet Steve" - received compli-
ments for his hairstlye, not all students were tolerant. According to the article:
one student offered him money to let her cut his hair. He declined."

T here has been a lot of contro-
versy surrounding former
Michigan Student Assembly presi-
dent Chris Armstrong's term as MSA
president. He was the target of ver-
bal harassment by former Michigan
assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell. In light of this, it's easy
for people to forget everything else
Armstrong has done this year.
But Armstrong hasn't.
"I've been a part of a lot of really
big changes," Armstrong said.
The push for the University to
adopt an open housing policy was one
of the most talked-about changes on
campus. The goal is to allow students
of any gender identification to live
with each other in University resi-
dence halls. Though the University
has only agreed to allow transgender
students to live with students of the
same gender, Armstrong says the pol-
icy is a step in the right direction.
"Even though it wasn't specifi-
cally what people or I wanted, it was
a really big step - a step towards
something bigger," said Armstrong.
Armstrong hopes that MSA has a
bright future.
"I think the MSA in the future
needs to realize they can do amaz-
ing things as long as they pick some-

thing, focus
on it, com-
mit to it and
show their
passion,"
Armstrong
said, add-
ing he hopes
MSA will
start work-
ing on issues
regarding the
University's
environmen-
tal sustain-
ability.
He credits
the Universi-
ty with teach-
ing him to be
passionate about helping the world
and to work hard to meet goals.
"This school is constantly teach-
ing me how to learn and care about
different issues," Armstrong said.
"I will always say these four years
defined me and gave me the oppor-
tunity to be who I am, even 50 years
from now."
Armstrong - who was the Uni-
versity's first openly gay MSA presi-
dent - is graduating with a sociology
degree and plans to move to Wash-

J t is said that nobody is perfect.
But redshirt junior Kellen
Russell's wrestling record would
suggest otherwise.
Russell, who recently com-
pleted a perfect regular season
with 39-straight victories en
route to a national championship
in his weight class, isn't like most
top-ranked wrestlers. He doesn't
usually win by huge margins. He
doesn't rack up pins. But he just
doesn't lose.
Wrestling is unlike any other
sport. When on the mats, just one
mistake in _one split second can
instantly turn into a pin: match
over. Everyone makes mistakes
- including wrestlers - but not
Russell, at least not in his last 39
competitions.
Michigan wrestling coach Joe
McFarland often says Russell has
a "quiet confidence" about him.
His teammates, who say he tends
to keep to himself, praise his focus
and determination, neither of
which cease after he walks off the
mats.
"If you work hard in wrestling,
it's just going to carry over into
working hard in the classroom,"

Russell said. "It's the same as if
you slack off in the classroom, then
you might start slacking off on the
mats, too. So, I think it's important
that if you're working hard at one,
you've got to work hard at it all."
A year from now, the High
Bridge, New Jersey native will be
set to graduate from the School
of Rinesiology.
And though he
will leave Mich-
igan, he doesn't
plan to leave
collegiate wres-
tling. Russell
wants to con-
tinue competi-
tive wrestling
and ultimately
return to college
as a wrestling
coach.
But for now,
the University
is fortunate to
have its nation-
al champion
returning for
one more sea-
son.
"I have

another year, so I've got to start
training for next year," he said,
trying to catch his breath after
winning national title number
one.
And with his work ethic, Rus-
sell is sure to be a contender in the
championship next year.

ington D.C to pursue a career in poli-
tics.
"I want to have balance in my life.
I want to be able to do a lot of differ-
ent things - have a social life and a
vigorous work life," Armstrong said.
Despite the negative and unwant-
ed attention he received this year,
Armstrong refuses to be hampered
by the Shirvell controversy.

S tudents have to be extremely
talented to make it into the
musical theatre department at
the University. But to be one of its
brightest stars takes determination
and a knack for teamwork, which
is exactly what senior A.J. Holmes
possesses.
In the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance, Holmes, a musical the-
atre major, has performed star-
ring roles in shows like "Ragtime."
Holmes is also involved with
MUSKET, where he was the musi-
cal director for "The 25th Annual
Putnam County Spelling Bee" and
Witt's End, an improvisational
comedy team. In addition, he co-
wrote three musicals in four years
of college.
"I tend to overcommit myself,"
Holmes said.
In his recent projects, Holmes
has been more than committed.
He was a co-writer for the highly
acclaimed viral Team Starkid suc-
cesses "A Very Potter Musical" and
"Me And My Dick."
"I was a sophomore, and I was
crazy enough to want to write a
musical," he said.
"Me and My Dick" started as
an overzealous attempt to write a
musical in 24 hours, but Holmes
pulled through. "Me and My Dick"

rose to No. 11 on Billboard's Top
Cast Albums chart last year.
Now a senior, Holmes co-wrote
the musical "Gibson Fleck" with
Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Carlos Valdes and Music, Theatre
& Dance junior Ali Gordon. Holmes
regards this as his most significant
achievement in his college career.
But more big achievements are to
come post-graduation, he said.
After the Department of Musi-
cal Theatre Senior Showcase in
New York City, Holmes plans to

made the squad.
Once Hines Jr. decided he want-
ed to be the band's drum major, he
tapped into the same bottomless
well of self-determination.
"Coming out of high school, I
couldn't touch my toes," Hines. Jr.
said.
But with his sights set on being
drum major, he started stretch-
ing and learning how to twirl. He
successfully pulled off a backbend
by his sophomore year. The rest is
history.
As drum major for the past two
years, Hines Jr. has taken his role
far beyond the spectacle he puts on
every Football Saturday.
"Your job as drum major, in my

Snly a handful of filmmakers
have their work selected to
screen at the Traverse City Film
Festival each summer and even
fewer of those selected are students.
Though LSA senior Bhanu Chun-
du has not yet received his degree,
that hasn't kept him from creating
films with the same cinematic qual-
ity as professional film-
makers. Over the past
year Chundu has served
as president of both the
Film and Video Student
Association and MFlick.
These clubs aim to bring
popular movies to the
University, sometimes
even before they hit the-
aters as sneak previews.
But watching block-
buster movies is only :
part of being a film stu-
dent. Chundu is just as
much a creator of movies
as he is a fan of them.

"It's really cool to go in rehears-
als and go with the actors because
that's where the movie changes the
most," Chundu said. "And it also
branches out to everything, so per-
formances affect cinematography
and production design and music.

need help learning how to march,
need help with their music, need
help with life ... my whole idea is
that if I can serve you, then you
know I want us to get to the high-
est level possible."
In addition to his deep con-
nection to the band, Hines Jr. - a
mechanical engineering major -

has taken a rigorous curriculum.
He plans to eventually combine his
technical knowledge with an MBA
in hopes of reaching his dream
career: roller coaster designer.
With his tremendous resolve,
a Hines Jr.-created roller coaster
could soon come to a Disney World
near you.
