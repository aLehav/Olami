Endowment
reaches all-time
high at $7.8 billion
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff Reporter
FLINT - The University's
endowment has reached its high-
est amount
ever at nearly NOTEBOOK
$8 billion,
according to the University's
2011 financial report released
yesterday.
At its monthly meeting here
yesterday, the University's
Board of Regents discussed the
University's financial health,
renovations to Yost Ice Arena,
improvements to campus build-
ings and Winter Commencement
honorary degree recipients.
As of June 30, the University's
endowment was valued at $7.8'
billion, according to the report
released at the meeting. The Uni-
versity has also seen a high rate
of investment returns at 24.3
percent from investments made
with endowment funds. At the
same time last year, the endow-
ment was worth $6.6 billion.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president

and chief financial officer,wrote
in the financial report that the
investment rate is one of the
highest among universities.
"As a result of their dedication
in building on our strong founda-
tion and tradition of excellence,
we continue to have the resourc-
es to make strategic investments
in the facilities, programs and
people that make our institution
one of the best public research
universities in the world," Slot-
tow wrote in the report.
Over the last decade, the
University has overstepped
the customary benchmark for
investment returns by approxi-
mately 3 percent, White said.
She also mentioned that the hard
work of the University's invest-
ment office, led by the Univer-
sity's Chief Investment Officer
Erik Lundberg, has paid off in
the 2011 fiscal year.
In an interview after the
meeting, Lundberg said the
endowment is instrumental to
the University's operation, and
he anticipates further growth
in the future through increased
gifts and smart investing.
Lundberg said he is excited
about the establishment of the
University's new initiative, the

Office's budget
I reduced by $90M
this year
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily Staff Reporter
A tighter budget and a maze
of red tape might keep celeb-
rity-stalkers on campus from
encountering their favorite
movie stars on the streets of
Ann Arbor.

The budget of the Michigan
Film Office, the state's distrib-
utor of film tax incentives, was
slashed to $25 million for the
2012 fiscal year - down from
$115 million in fiscal year 2010.
The reductions were included
in Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's budget, which was passed
by the state House and Senate
and took effect Oct 1.
The new incentive system
will grant a film a set amount
of money based on the Film
Office's criteria, which evalu-

ates the number of jobs the film
would create and the percent-
age of the production filmed
in Michigan, among other fac-
tors. Under the old percentage-
based system, films could be
awarded up to 42 percent of
their total operating costs.
Ryan Kazmirzack, a spokes-
man for Snyder, said the admin-'
istration sought to establish a
grant-based system because
the potential cost of some films
under the percentage-based
system made budgeting the

program too volatile.
"If the film industry did $1
billion worth of business in
Michigan, then the taxpayers
would have to come up with
$420 million to write them
a check," Kazmirzack said.
"(This) meant the more suc-
cessful we were as a state, the
more it was going to cost tax-
payers. It was impossible to
budget for because (we did not)
know how much it was going to
cost."

UNIVERSITY ACADEMICS
Sophomore Initiative helps
students explore 'U' majors


In class challenge,
students had $4.30
per day to buy food
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
For two days, 71 University
students ate off $4.30 per day.
But their spending wasn't
limited because of financial

need. They took on the eat-
ing challenge for a Univer-
sity class called "Twenty Two
Ways to Think About Food"
- a course offered under the
pilot program Sophomore Ini-
tiative - to experience what it
was like to live off the average
monetary allotment for people
receiving food stamps.
The Sophomore Initiative
was started this fall as a way
to increase programming for

sophomores as they make their
way through the in-between
stages of college, according to
Philip Deloria, LSA associate
dean of undergraduate educa-
tion and one of the creators of
the program. Deloria, who also
teaches "Twenty Two Ways to
Think About Food," said sopho-

Texas drought hinders water
distribution to various cities

Customers to
experience limited
water supplies
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)
- The devastating drought has
taken its toll on a Texas Panhandle
lake, now too low to keep supply-
ing water to nearly adozen cities.
The Canadian River Municipal
Water Authority near Amarillo
voted to stop usingLake Meredith,
which had been a water source
since the 1960s.
The water authority's half-
million customers are not likely to
notice the effects of Wednesday's
vote until next summer, said Kent
Satterwhite, the authority's gen-
eral manager. Although the lone
remaining water supply is plen-
.tiful, the peak demand may put
stress on its delivery, he said.
This year the lake's water, for
the first time, was pumped for cit-
ies' use only from June through
August instead of year-round
because water levels dropped to
a record low - just under 31 feet,

Satterwhite said. The record high
level was nearly 102 feet in 1973.
"Thesurface areaisonlyasmall
fraction of what it used to be," Sat-
terwhite said Thursday, adding
that only one boat ramp remains
open. "From my house, I can't see
the water anymore."
The U.S. Drought Monitor map
released Thursday shows 73.1 per-
cent of the state in the exceptional
range, down from 87.9 percent
last week. But much of the Pan-
handle remains in the most severe
drought stage because it did not
get as much rainfall thatfell across
other parts of Texas the past week.
The state is in its worst single-
year drought. And the rainfall
probability is below normal for the
state, including the Panhandle, for
the next three months, said Victor
Murphy, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in Fort
Worth.
The Canadian River Munici-
pal Water Authority's remaining
water source is the Ogallala Aqui-
fer, one of the world's largest.
The authority had already been
pumping water into wells from

that Roberts County aquifer for
its customers. Then in June, the
authority bought water rights
beneath 211,000 acres for $103
million from billionaire oilman
T. Boone Pickens and his Mesa
Water Inc.
The purchase involved about 4
trillion gallons of water, "enough
to last us 130 years," Satterwhite
said. But the 48-mile pipeline
from wells in Roberts County to
Amarillo and Lubbock and Lame-
sa - and several cities in between
- is not large enough to meet
increased summer demands, he
said.
Buildinga bigger pipeline is too
costly to be an option right now,
he said. Some cities might impose
water restrictions next summer to
help conserve.
Although Lake - Meredith is
expected to continue drying up,
Satterwhite said it could be used
as a water source in the future.
"There are so many variables,
but one good storm could just
change everything for us," he said.
"We're hopeful, but I wouldn't say
optimistic."

A seal sits in a cage during a cleaning session to get rid of fuel oil from its body in Tauranga, New Zealand, yesterday.
Grounded ship poses oil spill threat

New Zealand boat
dumps hundreds of
tons of oil into ocean
TAURANGA, New Zealand
(AP) - The calmest weather in
days has given salvage crews
hope they will be able today to
resume pumping the remaining
fuel from a cargo ship stuck on a
New Zealand reef.
The ship Rena has already
spilled hundreds of tons of oil
and crews are in a race against
nature to try and remove the
remaining fuel before waves

break up the vessel, which has
begun to crack apart and is
leaning on a 22-degree tilt.
Last week crews removed
about 10 tons of oil before the
weather forced them to post-
pone salvage attempts.
Environmentalists have
warned of a disaster for wildlife
if all the ship's 1,870 tons (1,700
metric tons) of oil and 220 tons
(200 metric tons) of diesel is
allowed to spill into the ocean.
Nick Bohm, a spokesman for
Maritime New Zealand which
is managing the emergency
response, told The Associated
Press Friday that crews are

"relatively positive" they can
proceed with plans to board the
vessel and begin pumping oil to
a nearby barge. He said pump-
ing should begin Friday after-
noon in an operation that could
last several days.
Bohm said there are stronger
winds forecast for the weekend
which may hamper the operation.
Meanwhile, several of the 88
containers that have fallen off its
deck had washed ashore by Fri-
day, and authorities confirmed
one container that toppled over-
board contained a hazardous sub-
stance. However, an official said it
should not pose a major threat.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Report: Problems
of Great Lakes
algae needs study
Scientific evidence is sketchy
about the causes of massive,
smelly algae blooms showing up
in most of the Great Lakes, and
further study of the problem is
needed, researchers contend in a
report released yesterday.
It's widely believed that phos-
phorus runoff from farms and
municipal waste treatment plants
is a leading cause of the algae
problem, which has returned
with a vengeance after it was con-
sidered largely solved decades
ago. Climate change and invasive
mussels are considered factors as
well.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.
Man convicted
for 2007 murders,
home invasion
A man was convicted yester-
day of murdering a woman and
her two daughters in a gruesome
2007 home invasion in which
family members were tied up,
molested, doused ingas andleftto
die in a fire. He now faces a pos-
sible death sentence.
Joshua Komisarjevsky, whose
accomplice is already on Con-
necticut's death row, stood and
faced jurors as they declared him
guilty of all 17 charges he faced,
including capital felony killing,
kidnapping and sexual assault.
After the verdict was read he sat
back in his chair, rocked slightly
back and forth and glanced briefly
at the jury. He yawned as he was
led out of the courtroom.
The only survivor of the attack,
Dr. William Petit, bit his lip and
closed his eyes as the verdict was
read.
"I thought from the begin-
ning that he was a lying socio-
pathic personality and probably
at this moment he doesn't think
he is guilty of anything," he told
reporters outside the courthouse.
SAN FRANCISCO
Investigation of
deadly California
train crash begins
Federal officials began inves-
tigating an Oakland train crash
yesterday involving two Amtrak
trains that injured 17people.
The investigators will exam-
ine equipment, interview crew
members and check any radio or
cellphone exchanges with dis-
patchers as part of the probe,
according to Federal Railroad
Administration spokesman War-
ren Flatau.
Flatau said the investigation
could take between three and six
months to complete.
The crash occurred around 10
p.m. Wednesday when an Amtrak
train ran into a train that was
unloading passengers at an Oak-

land station.
Seventeen people suffered
minor injuries, according to
Amtrak. Company spokeswoman
Vernae Graham said seven of
those people were taken to hospi-
tals, where they were treated and
released.
RAMALLAH, West Bank
Hamas criticized
by Palestinians
over prisoner swap
Some Palestinians criticized
Hamas yesterday for conceding
too much in its deal to swap a cap-
tured Israeli soldier for more than
a thousand Palestinian inmates.
Much of the criticism has come
from officials who are loyal to
Fatah, Hamas' bitter rival for con-
trol over the Palestinians. Yet it
appears to reflect a deeper unease
over whether the price Palestin-
ians paid for Schalit's capture
was too high. Critics of the deal
are disappointed that some of the
most prominent prisoners will
not be released and that hundreds
may be deported or not allowed to
return to their homes.

CHALLENGE
From Page 1
tor of the University's Center of
Entrepreneurship. Klinke esti-
mates there will be 75 to 90 stu-
dents participating throughout
the state this year.
During the six-month com-
petition, teams are paired with
a professional mentor to devel-
op ways to use clean energy in
the students' business plan and
make their idea marketable to
customers. Teams will work on
their business models until the
last day of the challenge on Feb.
17, 2012, when $100,000 in price
money will be spread out among
the winning teams.
For the first round, the initial'
teams that applied will be nar-
rowed down to approximately 25
teams. In previous Clean Energy
Venture Challenges, fewer teams
were allowed to participate in
this round.
Klinke said she is looking
forward to the revamped skill
building phase this year.
"Instead of going through a
phase of eliminating teams, we
want to give all the teams that
make it ... two days of intensive
skill building where they learn
about their customers, what
problems they are solving and
the basics of what a venture is,"
Klinke said. "Then we give them
intensive mentoring."
Norm Rapino, a mentor-in-
residence at Tech Transfer -
the University's office that helps
technologies developed here to
move to market - is mentoring in
this competition for the first time
this year and is excited about the
challenge's new format.
"That gives them a time to talk
to customers, figure out what
customers want, change and
adapt to what the market says
they should be doing," Rapino
said. "If you have the time, you
can perfect that idea."
Rapino added that mentors
with entrepreneurial experience
play an invaluable role in helping
the student teams.
"If someone tells you how to

play a sport, and you learn the
rules and everything else, until
you've played it, you don't know
how to do it. And to a degree,
that's the same way it is with an
entrepreneur, a start-up," Rapino
said. "It helps to have a mentor
who's done it."
Klinke said the Venture Chal-
lenge is unique in that it involves
students from across the state.
Rapino also said the competition
encourages collaboration among
many disciplines.
"The whole point is to cre-
ate sort of an entrepreneurial
eco-system in and among all the
schools in Michigan," Rapino
said.
The teams will work on their
ideas for developing companies
this month, according to Klinke.
As the process continues, teams
can receive grants of $2,000
from the Center of Entrepre-
neurship to aid their ventures.
Rapino added that though it
is a competition, the students'
work has an impact on real-
world problems.
The students will work with
investors from venture capital
firms throughout the competition
and will pitch their final ideas to
the companies at the final event
in February to see if they want to
invest in their start-ups.
The main sponsors of this
year's competition include the
University's Center for Entrepre-
neurship, DTE Energy and The
Kresge Foundation.
"It's not just an exercise for
fun or a classroom credit," Rap-
ino said. "This is a real venture
to create jobs, to create economic
activity."
Rackham student Adam
Byrnes, who is studying in the
University's Erb Institute, is
competing in the challenge and
said he is looking forward to
working with the mentors so he
and his team can learn as much
as possible.
"We'll do whatever it takes to
make sure we learn the most that
we can, and grow the business
the best as we can and hopefully
that will translate into winning,"
Byrnes said.

Hedge fund exec. sentenced
to 11 years for insider trading

Prosecutors claim
executive made up
to $75 million
NEW YORK (AP) - Raj Raja-
ratnam, the hedge fund billion-
aire at the center of the biggest
insider-trading case in U.S. his-
tory, was sentenced yesterday to
11 years behind bars - the stiff-
est punishment ever handed out
for the crime.
"His crimes and the scope of
his crimes reflect a virus in our
business culture that needs to be
eradicated," U.S. District Judge
Richard J. Holwell said. "Simple
justice requires a lengthy sen-
tence."
The 54-year-old founder of
the Galleon Group hedge fund
was also fined $10 million and
ordered to forfeit $53.8 million
in what the judge said were illicit
profits fromtradingon confiden-
tial corporate information.
Prosecutors said Rajaratnam
made as much as $75 million in
all by cultivating a network of
friends, former classmates and
other tipsters at various compa-
nies and investment firms who
supplied him with early word on
such things as mergers and earn-
ings announcements. In return,
they received kickbacks or a
chance to get in on the action.
Among the companies he
. profited from were Google, IBM,
Hilton Hotels, Intel, Advanced
Micro Devices and Goldman
Sachs.
The sentencing was the last
major act in a series of pros-
ecutions that followed Rajarat-
nam's arrest in 2009, the same
year he was ranked No. 559 by
Forbes magazine among the
world's wealthiest billionaires,
with a $1.3 billion net worth.
More than two dozen people
were arrested in the investiga-
tion, nicknamed Perfect Hedge,
and all were convicted.
The scandal - along with
the 2008 financial meltdown
and the Wall Street abuses

it exposed - stoked populist
anger in the U.S. and complaints
that the stock market is a suck-
er's game, rigged by insiders.
The judge called it "an assault
on the free markets that are a
fundamental element of our
democratic society. There may
not be readily identifiable vic-
tims, but when the playing field
is not level, the integrity of the
marketplace is called into ques-
tion and the public suffers."
Asked at his sentencing if he
would like to speak, Rajaratnam
responded: "No, thank you, Your
Honor."
The Sri Lanka-born Rajarat-
nam was ordered to report to
a yet-to-be-designated prison
Nov. 28. Until then, he must
remain confined to his $10 mil-
lion Manhattan condominium.
His lawyers asked that he be
sent to the medical facility at the
federal prison in North Caro-
lina where Bernard Madoff is
serving his 150-year sentence.
He has advanced diabetes and
needs a kidney transplant,
accordingto the judge.
The longest previous sen-
tence in an insider-trading case
was 10 years, given twice before,
most recently last month to one
of Rajaratnam's co-defendants.
But Rajaratnam's punishment
fell far short of the 24 years
prosecutors had requested.
Federal prosecutor Reed
Brodsky said insider trading
"makes a mockery of the prin-
ciple that no one participant has
an unfair advantage through
thievery." He said Rajaratnam
corrupted at least 20 fellow
traders and insiders, and at least
19 public companies were vic-
tims of his crimes.
"Today you sentence a man
who is the modern face of illegal
insider trading," Brodsky told
the judge. "He is arguably the
most egregious insider trader to
face sentencing in a courthouse
in the United States."
The prosecutor said insider
trading - carried out by smart,
educated people - had "become

rampant" because the incen-
tives to commit it were higher
than ever before and detecting it
was extremely difficult.
The judge said Rajaratnam
deserved some leniency, noting
his poor health and his chari-
table work in helping the home-
less and the victims of Sept. 11
and natural disasters.
Rajaratnam's lawyers had
argued for 61/2 to nine years.
Defense attorney Terence
Lynam asked the judge to show
compassion because of Rajarat-
nam's illnesses, saying: "He does
not deserve to die in prison."
Galleon was one ofthe world's
largest hedge funds before it
collapsed in the wake of Raja-
ratnam's arrest, and the case
against him and his cohorts was
one of the most closely watched
insider-trading scandals since
the Ivan Boesky and Michael
Milken cases in the 1980s.
Boesky was a stock specu-
lator who pleaded guilty and
served two years in prison.
Milken, known as the junk
bond king, pleaded guilty to
securities violations in 1989,
served 22 months and paid a
$200 million fine.
The Rajaratnam probe relied
heavily on the most extensive
use of wiretaps ever for a white-
collar case. Prosecutors cap-
tured conversations in which
he and his accomplices could
be heard gleefully celebrating
their inside information.
At his trial in May, pros-
ecutors said Rajaratnam could
convert short telephone con-
versations into millions in
profits. For instance, they said,
a 30-minute call with an Intel
Corp. insider yielded a $2 mil-
lion windfall.
Anil Kumar, Rajaratnam's
classmate at the University
of Pennsylvania's prestigious
Wharton School, testified
that he fed Rajaratnam inside
information about the acquisi-
tion of ATI Technologies Inc.
by Kumar's client, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc.

arts degree.
During one trip from East
Lansing to visit his family in Ann
Arbor, Van Dyck-Dobos recalled
walking by the boarded-up red
shop with his sister and con-
templated its potential. It wasn't
until years later that it would
become Le Dog.
After graduating from MSU,
Van Dyck-Dobos moved to Chi-
cago, where he managed several
large-scale restaurants, which
sometimes served as many as
5,000 dinners a night. After
growing wary of the big city res-
taurant scene, Van Dyck-Dobos
returned to Ann Arbor to open a
hot dog stand in a community he
said is "more manageable."
When Le Dog opened in 1979,
it sold only lemonade and hot
dogs. But the menu has since
expanded to include more
options and gourmet dishes, like
their famous soups.
"I got bored of hot dogs and
decided to do all the other
things," Van Dyck-Dobos said.
Since Le Dog occupies a
small space, Van Dyck-Dobos
said expanding the restaurant's
offerings was difficult.
"We had five people in here
working elbow-to-elbow," Van
Dyck-Dobos said.
Despite the limited space and
small staff, Le Dog offers an
extensive menu, which chang-
es daily. The restaurant offers
approximately 300 kinds of
soup, which rotate on the menu
throughout the year.
With such a large variety and
only a few soups served each day,

Van Dyck-Dobos urges costum-
era not-to be discouraged if they
can't find their favorite one the
day they stop by.
"Just come on by and choose
a soup," he said. "I can almost
guarantee if you look at the
menu, (you) will find something
you like."
Someof the most popular
soups include cheesy chicken
tortilla and chicken white chili,
which Van Dyck-Dobos attempts
to have on sale every day. Anoth-
er favorite, the lobster bisque, is
available on Thursdays and Fri-
days. Van Dyck-Dobos's favorites
include chicken paprika, veal
tarragon and pork curry, which
he makes about 10 times a year.
Van Dyck-Dobos estimated
that about 40 to 60 percent of
his customers are University
students - especially at the East
Liberty Street location. The
restaurant's second location on
Main Street attracts mainly busi-
nessmen and women, he said.
Because the East Liberty
Street business is so dependent
on students, Van Dyck-Dobos
said the company struggles a bit
during the summer. Despite this,
Le Dog doesn't have a website,
Facebook page or any other spe-
cial offers to accrue additional
revenue.
"We do not spend a nickel on
advertising," Van Dyck-Dobos
said. "We never have."
Still, Van Dyck-Dobos hasn't
had difficulty earning national
acclaim. Le Dog was featured in
an Oct. 7 article in the Chicago
Tribune praising his famous
soups.
"People know us," he said.
"(Our business) is word of mouth
and good will."

Respect allidentities
National Coming Out Week promotes tolerance
Members of the LGBT community in the United States
military can now be open about their sexuality since
"don't ask, don't tell" was repealed last month, but they
still face major inequalities in our society. Events like National
Coming Out Week remind us of these issues and the necessity of
equal rights for every citizen. This week is a reminder of the impor-
tance of being understanding and respectful of different sexual ori-
entations and lifestyles.

I

Today is the fifth day of National Com-
ing Out Week. The celebration has grown to
a nationwide event since it started in 1988.
National Coming Out Day, which kicks off
the week each year, is celebrated throughout
the country. At the University, the weeklong
event was celebrated with a rally on the Diag
on Monday, as well as other events held by
the Michigan Student Assembly and student
groups in supportof LGBT students and their
allies on campus.
Over the past year, the media has been
awash with stories of horrific bullying and
attacks on LGBT students. But bullying that
happens on a daily basis, and may seem harm-
less to some, often goes unnoticed. Across the
nation, nine out of 10 LGBT middle school
and high school students have been harassed
at school, according to statistics from the
National Youth Association. And more than
a third of LGBT youth have attempted sui-
cide at some point. These students are also
more likely to suffer depression than het-
sexual students. Events such as National
Co.uing Out Week draw n cessary attention
tV .n issue that can pose a legitimate threat
to young people in America.
While Ann Arbor is generally considered
a socially progressive city and the University
a free-thinking institution, it's still inipor-
tant to remember and respect the difficulties
LGBT students can face. Even in the most
positive environments, a stigma still exists

around LGBT issues. Michigan has some of
the strictest laws in the country banning gay
marriage and limiting same-sex partner ben-
efits.
If LGBT individuals continue to be mar-
ginalized by American laws, events like
National Coming Out Week will continue to
be important to advocate for equal rights.
This week is an opportunity to create a sup-
portive environment for LGBT students, so
they may be proud of their identity. And it
reminds all students that they must be cogni-
zant of how they speak and behave.
But the support for LGBT students
shouldn't end after this week. It's important
to continue to build a tolerant environment
throughout the year. The Spectrum Center
is open year-round to provide assistance and
open forums, and this supportive mentality
should spread throughout the University. All
students should have access to resources that
help them with any personal identity strug-
gles. And if there is a problem, they should
have a safe place to seek help. The University
must provide a safe and secure environment
for all students.
The University has been touting the phrase
"Expect Respect" to encourage students to
be conscious of the way they act toward each
other. The message of National Coming Out
Week shouldn't be limited to just one week
of the year, but should instead have influence
across campus every day.

very Monday night, I bring
down an overflowing recy-
cling bin to the edge of my
driveway. A year
ago, I would have
considered this a
significant act in
helping to pre-
serve the envi-
ronment, but
with a brother
working in the LEAH
sustainability POTKIN
and green engi- _
neering field, I'm
realizing quickly
that a blue bin full of recycled bot-
tles and boxes simply isn't enough.
Thus, in this age of green and sus-
tainable living, it is vital that every-
one, students included, go above and
beyond to protect and save the envi-
ronment. The blue bin alone won't
cut it anymore.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman recently released a new
sustainability initiative in a speech
outlining the University's 14-year
plan for sustainability. Some of the
plans include installing solar pan-
els on North Campus and replacing
regular cars and buses with hybrid
ones, with the laudable goal of cut-
tingcthe University's greenhouse gas
emissions by 25 percent by 2025. As
ambitious and meritorious as the
University's plan is, its ultimate suc-
cess may very well depend on the
involvement and commitment of
students. Because when it comes to
saving the environment, we're more
than just tuition payers, we're ener-
gy consumers and conservationists.
Not to mention, with Ann Arbor
ranked one of the leaders in green

initiatives, the least we Wolverines
can do is live up to our reputation
and work as hard as our beloved city
does. Students on and off campus
must try their hardest, and move
into this era of sustainability armed
with blue bins, energy-efficient light
bulbs and acan-do attitude.
I know many students are regi-
mented in their recycling and
energy-saving routines, but I see
too many water bottles thrown
in trash cans and lights left on in
houses to not address these seem-
ingly minor issues. Because, really,
at a school with more than 25,000
undergraduates alone, every light
switch left on makes a huge dif-
ference. I'm a college student, I'm
lazy and I'm guilty of committing
sustainability crimes too. But howI
see it, if we can pull all-nighters and
easily careen from pre-game party
to pre-game party before trekking
on to the Big House on foot, we can
handle searching for a recycling
bin that might be outside our line
of vision. Not to mention, turn-
ing down our thermostats a few
degrees and taking the time to go
upstairs to turn off the lights left on
in the rush to get out the front door.
And the bathroom, my friends,
is no place to forget about the envi-
ronment either. In fact, there are
important environmental decisions
to be made every time you excuse
yourself to the little girls or boys
room here on campus. First, are you
actually going to flush the handle up
for liquid;waste.and:down for solid
waste? And second, are you really
going to use a super-speed, high-
tech hand dryer when there are
water-absorbing paper towels there

too? Well, Yes. You have to. Every-
one has to. The University is taking
a stance and making changes, and
it's important that the student body
does the same. We should be grate-
ful that the University offers us so
many eco-friendly options, and we
should be eager to take advantage
of them at all times. Note - new
recycling bins like the ones in North
Quad even have an opening shaped
for bottles to make the process vir-
tually foolproof!
Take advantage
of eco-friendly
options at the 'U.'
Other small steps students can
take to help the University make a
big difference include using refill-
able water bottles, switching to
energy-efficient light bulbs and
walking to places instead of driv-
ing (not only good for the environ-
ment, but good for your health too!).
So although we can't all go around
installing solar panels, we can and
should go around milking these
new green accessories for all they're
worth. So keep those blue bins over-
flowing and toilets flushing in the
right direction because a flush in
the right direction doubles as a step
in the, right direction-the green
direction, that is.

Students for Life stand up
for the rights of the unborn
TO THE DAILY:
Students for Life is a social justice group.
Not political. Not religious. We're here to con-
front a social justice issue that would other-
wise remain disregarded on campus.
If, as Daniel Chardell claims in his column
(Abortion is notgenocide, 10/11/2011), he spent
nearly two hours on the Diag, he would have
heard our justification for the dehumaniza-
tion-based parallel between the unborn and
Holocaust victims. And if Chardell had spent
a portion of that time perusing the display, he
would have read one panel that said, "Com-
parable is not identical." Abortion's existence
today is due largely to ignorance, not the
shoveling of the innocent into gas chambers.
Certainly the millions of deaths in each case
deserve equal attention, but while pro-choice
advocates aren't ending the mass extermina-
tion, they are not Nazis.
Chardell assumes that Students for Life
Calling the Diag exhibit
insulting is accurate

does not understand the "much larger soci-
etal issue" of unwanted pregnancies. We
beg to differ. The central problem isn't that
unplanned pregnancies are occurring but that
we're cultivating a culture in which we'll sac-
rifice a human life to make ours more conve-
nient. Sure, we could devote all our time and
resources to prevention, but then who will
advocate for the unborn? Somethingstill won't
change: The unborn still won't have rights,
society still won't care and innocent lives still
will be sacrificed when the condom breaks.
Minimizing abortion isn't ending it altogether.
So excuse us for our radical idea that the
life created from a broken condom still has
the same value as the millions lost before it.
Students for Life doesn't care what you do
with your sex life. You can sleep with whom-
ever you want, whenever you want, however
you want - until a third person enters the
picture. And, yes, we're the same radicals
who at that point expect you to take responsi-
bility for procreation.
Carmen Allen
LSA junior and president of Students for Life
tion to abortions (quite frankly, the correct
term would actually be "homicide"), Chard-
ell's piece drew attention to what I view to be
a very common phenomenon in 21st century
American culture, which is the casual and
rather insulting manner in which we view and
discuss atrocities of the human past.
I would expect such disrespect from uned-
ucated individuals who didn't know better,
but I am shocked that an educated group of
University of Michigan students who pride
themselves on their love and support of the
human race were insensitive enough to display
pictures of corpses of African Americans and
Jews without any regard for the feelings of
their fellow students, faculty and staff. If you
want to condemn abortion, fine. Just don't do
it at the expense of others whose histories you
couldn't possibly begin to grasp.

ALEXANDER HEPPERLE I
To the bitter end

In a freak chance of fate, with the help of friends and
financial aid dollarsthat were supposed to go toward pay-
ing off my rent, I got to attend game 4 of the Tigers-Yan-
kees playoff. I really couldn't believe it even as I walked
up to the stadium. The giant Louisville Slugger bats signi-
fied the entranceway, and a stone cat protected the gate
from above. I was there. At Comerica Park, a place nearly
every person in Southeastern Michigan has memories of
regardless of whether they like baseball or not.
But this was no ordinary game, and no ordinary oppo-
nent. This was the American League Division Series, and
this opponent was none other than the New York Yan-
kees, also known as The Bronx Bombers and The Evil
Empire. The single-most winning team in all of baseball
with 27 world championships compared to the Tigers'
measly four. What chance did we stand? This is the team
of Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Micky Mantle, Alexander
Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, and now, sadly, Curtis Grander-
son. However, this is no ordinary city with no ordinary
sports fans. This is Detroit, and what the Tigers mean to
us is more powerful than any words Ican write down.
Anyone who is familiar with the entertainment indus-
try should know the reputation of Detroit: We are known
as one of the absolute best concert towns with some-of
the craziest sports fans out there. Who else throws octopi
ontotheiceathockeygames?Whoelse'sfootballteamhas
never won the Super Bowl for as long as there has been
a Super Bowl, yet sells out almost every game? Nobody.
One of my friends at the Tigers game asked me why this
was, and I didn't even need to think twice. I turned to
him and said, "When you've got nothing, you've got noth-
ing to lose." And most residents in Michigan don't have
much to lose anymore. The graduation rate for Detroit
Public Schools hovers around 60 percent. The unemploy-
ment rate for the state stands stagnant at 11 percent and
was as high as 15 percent in July 2009. Almost every sin-
gle family I knew growing up in Westland, Mich. (about
20 minutes outside of Detroit) worked for the Big Three

automakers. We all know what happened to them, don't
we?
The University and the state of Michigan are two dras-
tically different things. If you don't know this yet, it's
about time you stepped outside the bubble of Ann Arbor
and had a beer or two with a midnight shift line worker
or a McDonald's shift manager. I looked around at the
stadium and felt one powerful thought echo in my head
- these are my people. I heard the conversations around
me bring me back to a time when I wasn't attending an
elite university - a time when I myself was working at
a fast food restaurant and trying to keep my tank of gas
off empty.
I listened tothe conversationaround me:"Man, Ihad to
cut out of work two hours earlyto be here, but I wouldn't
miss it for the world!" "I hear you brother. The transmis-
sion on my Jeep gave out on the way here. It's stranded
on 96 as we speak - took a $60 cab ride to see the game!"
A man sitting next to me was wearing an Ernie Harwell
"EH" patch sewn into his ratty cap stamped with the old
English letter 'D' and I commented on how great Ernie
was for the team. He replied, "This was my dad's hat. We
used to have season tickets back at old Tigers Stadium.
Get this bro, he died the same day they closed the doors.
Last thing I heard him say was, 'What a shame."' Yes, I
was at home.
The bottom line is yes, we lost the game, but this isn't
the first time Detroit was on the losing end of things.
That game was about more than baseball. It was about
loyalty. About the small taking on the large. About hope.
In the bottom of the ninth and down nine runs, as all
hope seemed lost, the man next to me stared ahead - his
friends already gone - and spoke to himself barely loud
enough for me to hear the words that personify the spirit
of Detroit, "We will stay to the bitter end." Truer words
have never been spoken.
Alexander Hepperle is an LSA sophomore.


TO THE DAILY:
I believe that Daniel Chardell summed up
last week's Students for Life exhibit very well
when he described it as insulting (Abortion is
not genocide, 10/11/2011).
Due to the graphic nature of the display,
I chose not to go near the Diag last Monday
and Tuesday and therefore, had to rely on
others to tell me about the visuals that were
on display. I learned from Chardell's column
that photographs of Holocaust victims and
inaccurate allusions to genocides were pre-
sented along with the images of fetuses, as
were pictures of lynching victims as I later
discovered.
Besides calling attention to the fact that the
use of the word "genocide" is incorrect in rela-

When is borrowed
art OK, and when
is it plagiarism?
By JULIA
SMITH-EPPSTEINER
Daily Arts Writer
Beyonc6's latest music video
"Countdown" dominates pro-
fusely on almost every level.
Numerous close-ups of her chic-
but-sassy facial expressions
(Queen Blink, anybody?), fierce
shimmies, pop art-style editing,
killer wardrobe, Audrey Hep-
burn bangs and the product as
a whole proves itself impressive
and as punchy as it gets, but the
video flounders in one, big way -
one much bigger than her belly
- and ladies and gentlemen, the
name of the game is plagiarism.
As an aficionado of both
Beyonce Knowles and Anne
Teresa De Keersmaeker, I find
it difficult to not linger in what
could have been. How excit-
ing it is to imagine a blissful
matrimony of pop culture and
modern dance with two females
of knockout talent, bringing
together two far away worlds,
yet the situation is more like
theft than marriage.
The line between referencing
the work of others and steal-
ing has been walked frequently
in the past and, as long as art
exists, will continue to be tip-
toed forever. But the reality of
"Countdown" is that portions of
the movement and scene struc-
ture are direct quotes from the
work that De Keersmaeker cho-
reographed for her own modern
dance company, Rosas. The most
exact imitation was taken from
the window scene of a female
trio and soloist in "Rosas danst
Rosas," which had been made
into a dance film by Thierry De
Mey in 1983Beyonce and video
director Adria Petty also maneu-
vered in brief excerpts from De
Keersmaeker's "Achterland."
I realize there are people who
think it's kosher that Beyonce
didn't ask for permission and
give proper acknowledgement
because of the viewpoint that art
can't be copied; nothing can be

"All the unoriginal ladies/ All the unoriginal ladies..."

owned nor can it be completely
original. I agree with the idea
at large, and I'm sure De Keers-
maeker was inspired by some-
thing - there's no blank slate for
creation - but the viewpoint is
flawed when applied to the cir-
cumstance in conversation.
It's been mentioned that
Beyonc6 has relied a little too
heavily on other people's works
in past music videos. For exam-
ple, Bob Fosse's steps from
"Mexican Breakfast" make a
solid appearance in "Single
Ladies," but this time around,
the sampling is astonishingly
more straightforward and not
specifically acknowledged.
There are instances in the art
world when it's acceptable to
borrow movement - the moon-
walk being an example of this.
It can be used, and no one needs
to ask permission because the
step is iconic, and the universe
is aware of the man who created
it. As raw and gorgeous as De
Keersmaeker's moves are, she is
not Michael Jackson, and not yet
timeless - she is a working art-

ist who deserves recognition for
her material.
"What's rude about it is that
they don't even bother about
hiding it," said De Keersmaeker,
in a statement on a Belgian blog.
"They seem to think they could
do it because it's a famous work
... Am I honored? Look, I've seen
local school kids doing this.
That's a lot more beautiful."
Although Beyonce's sexy
flair added to De Keersmaker's
excerpts worked into the appeal
of "Countdown," there was no
homage paid in return. In grade
school and in gradschool, if a ref-
erence is not footnoted, you fail.
Well, De Keersmaeker was not
only not credited for her original
work but was as surprised as you
'and 'Itosee her own choreogra-
phy when watching the video for
the first time. Iam curious about
the consequences - what's the
equivalent of an F for Queen
B? My guess is a loss of respect
from some of her fans and a law-
suit that won't make a dent in
her treasure chestwon'tbeginto
touch her platinum career.


Instability proves captivating in 'Homeland'

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
For the Daily
When watching "Homeland,"
Showtime's new "24"-esque
political thriller, it's easy to for-
get this is an
episode of tele-
vision and not
a full-length Homland
action movie.
The cinematic Pilot
quality of the
camerawork Sundays at10 a.m.
and the mas- Showtime
terfully crafted
story come together to form a
style similar to that of director
Paul Greengrass ("The Bourne
Ultimatum"). However, "Home-
land" is no standalone work - it
is the beginning of what could
easily become the best new
drama this fall.
Like '24,' if
Jack Bauer was
a crazy chick.
The show follows Carrie
Matheson (Claire Danes, "Tem-
ple Grandin"), an unstable CIA
operative who starts pursuing
her latest bold theory when an
American POW named Nicho-
las Brody (Damian Lewis,
"Band of Brothers") is suddenly
rescued. Less than a year earli-
er, an Iraqi prisoner whispered
in Carrie's ear that a captured
American soldier had switched
sides. Brody, having survived
brutal captivity for eight years,
returns home as an American
hero. Unconvinced and already
dismissed by her superiors at
the CIA for her impulsive ten-

dencies, Carrie takes it upon
herself to investigate whether
Brody really is a living miracle or
a sleeper cell agent working for
the enemy.
The entire pilot would fall
apart if it were not for the excel-
lent performances from its cast.
Carrie has moments of complete
vulnerability immediately fol-
lowed by showcases of powerful
resolution, and Danes delivers
on both fronts. Lewis gives an
equally compelling perfor-
mance. With very few lines, he
still manages to fully embody his
character, whose discomforting
transition back into life at home
after years of torture is unnerv-
ing to watch.
Fans of FOX's seven-sea-
son political thriller "24" will
certainly find similarities in

"Homeland" - after all, creators
Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa
are "24" alumni. But to say that
"Homeland" is the new "24"
would be a mistake. While Jack
Bauer and Carrie Matheson have
a few things in common (both
are considered reckless by their
coworkers and prefer to work
alone), they are inherently dif-
ferent. Bauer knew how to take
charge, and even when those
around him found his theories to
be a bit of a stretch, they usually
listened to him. Carrie, on the
other hand, seems perpetually
on the edge of being fired. Her
lack of balance and control stems
not from a thirst for risk, but
from a psychological disorder
that both the audience and those
close to Carrie are left mostly in
the dark about.

Another aspectof "Homeland"
that sets it apart from "24" and
most serialized action programs
is that it does not focus entirely
on the urgency of the political
conflict. "24" succeeded in its
storytelling - keeping viewers
on their toes at all times - exe-
cuting grand action sequences
and throwing in just the right
amount of twists and turns. But
its "real-time" pacing does not
allow much room for stories out-
side Bauer's mission to save the
world. "Homeland" provides us
with many interconnecting sto-
ries: Brody's reintegration with
his family, his wife Jessica's
(Morena Baccarin, "V") attempts
to piece her broken family back
together and Carrie's internal
struggles and fragile relation-
ships. "Homeland" also has the

obvious advantage of airing on
Showtime and is therefore not
constricted by the level of cen-
sorship that plagues network
television.
Striking a balance between a
thrilling, topical plot and explor-
ing complex relationships is
something few dramas manage
to accomplish, especially so early
on. "Homeland" is essentially
everything AMC's cancelled
"Rubicon" wanted to be: a com-
pelling, well-written story that
explores the moral ambiguities
associated with America's cur-
rent wars. The premiere of this
show marks the return of the
smart serial action drama and
successfully intertwines beau-
tiful cinematography with raw
human emotions captured by the
subtle excellence of its cast.

Technology Startups, which
will invest up to $25 million in
University start-up businesses
over the next decade. He added
he is confident that returns on
the University's investment
in start-up companies will be
lucrative.
"There's a lot of good things
about the initiative," Lundberg
said, "but for me, it had to over-
come the hurdle of being able
to justify taking risks with the
endowment money."
YOST ICE ARENA PROJECT
BACKED BY REGENTS
The regents approved the
schematic design and funding to

improve seating and fan ameni-
ties at Yost Ice Arena.
Slottow said during the meet-
ing that this part of the project
must be approved to ensure that
construction doesn't interfere
with the hockey season and fin-
ishes by the fall 2012 deadline.
"We are requesting your
approval of the schematic
design and also to go out (and)
to (solicit) bids with some early
procurement packages to fit this
aggressive schedule," Slottow
said.
The regents were shown ren-
derings of the proposed renova-
tion, which includes additional
accessible seating for people with
disabilities, more concession
stands and a new press box. At
their June meeting, the regents
approved the $14.7 million reno-
vation of the 88-year-old build-

LABORATORY TO BE
HOUSED IN NEW HOSPITAL
The regents gave the green
light to finish the 11th floor of
the new C.S. Mott Children's and
Von Voigtlander Women's Hos-
pital as a cardiac catheterization
laboratory. The hospital is sched-
uled to open in November.
The laboratory project -
estimated to cost $3.45 million
- will be funded by the Univer-
sity of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers' resources.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Slottow explained that some
space in the hospital had been
left unfinished to accommodate
for future needs that may arise.
He said he hadn't anticipated the
need for a cardiac catheteriza-

tion lab so quickly, but trends
show that a pediatric unit in the
lab is necessary.
REGENTS APPROVE
POWER PLANT UPDATE
The University's Central
Power Plant, which allocates
power to Central Campus, will
receive an update to its control
system after the regents passed a
$6.75 million upgrade.
At the meeting, Slottow said
the project will revamp the Cen-
tral Power Plant's system, which
heats and cools much of the cam-
pus. The project is scheduled to
be completed in fall 2014.
HONORARY DEGREE
RECIPIENTS APPROVED
The regents heard the recom-

mendations and approved hon-
orary degrees to be awarded at
Winter Commencement to four
people in a variety of fields.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman read the nomina-
tions for honorary degrees. Jill
Abramson, executive editor of
The New York Times, will give
the keynote address at the com-
mencement ceremony on Dec. 18
at Crisler Arena. Abramson will
also receive an honorary Doctor-
ate of Humane Letters.
Coleman said Abramson is
a compelling candidate for the
degree because she serves on
the board of directors of the
Knight-Wallace Fellowship at
the University. Knight-Wallace
fellows are professional jour-
nalists who are given a grant
to study at the University for a
one-year period.

Coleman added that
Abramson represents powerful,
professional women as the first
female executive editor of the
Times - a position she assumed
Sept. 6.
"We are very excited that she
is going to be our commence-
ment speaker," Coleman said.
Nancy Cantor, chancellor
of Syracuse University, will
receive an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree at the ceremony.
Leslie Benet, professor of bio-
pharmaceutical sciences and
pharmaceutical chemistry at
the University of California, San
Francisco, and Robert Putnam,
the Peter and Isabel Malkin
professor of public policy in the
John F. Kennedy School of Gov-
ernment at Harvard University,
will each receive an honorary
Doctorate of Science degree.

FILM
From Page 1
Kazmirzack added that the
new program saves taxpay-
ers money and gives the Film
Office the ability to negotiate the
appropriations it doles out.
Michelle Begnoche, spokes-
woman for the Michigan Film
Office, said the office cannot
start accepting applications and

distributing money until state
legislators define the parameters
that films can use the grants for.
Though the office's new budget
is 78 percent lower than last year,
Begnoche said the transition to
a smaller budget is manageable
because the office had an "unof-
ficial cap" on spending in 2011.
"Under the tax credit system,
there is no cap," Begnoche said.
"However, when the governor
made his budget proposal, his

directive to our office was that
we work within $25 million (in
2011). So we've already been
doing this for a year."
Even with a significantly
smaller budget, the office has not
seen a drop in film applications.
Begnoche said the Film Office
has already approved 21 projects
to be filmed next year, and she
isn't concerned that filmmakers
will stop coming to the state.
"Anytime you have $25 million

to offer to folks, there are people
that are interested," Begnoche
said. "Our goal is finding the best
projects and attracting the best
projects in Michigan."
Over the summer, students
and Ann Arbor residents were
star struck with frequent sight-
ings of actor Jason Segel and
actress Emily Blunt, who were in.
town for the filming of the movie
"The Five-Year Engagement,"
that will premier in 2012. Earlier

this year, actors George Clooney
and Ryan Gosling made appear-
ances in Ann Arbor to film the
recently released "The Ides of
March."
Though the Michigan Legisla-
ture passed the state budget ear-
lier this year, disagreement over
the impact of the reduced Film
Office budget remains.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor), who supported the
film tax credits, said the addi-

tional job creation and spend-
ing brought on by increased film
production in the state provid-
ed much-needed assistance to
Michigan's economy.
"We saw a tremendous amount
of (economic) activity in Ann
Arbor and Washtenaw County,"
Irwin said. "The biggest impact
is going to be hotels and restau-
rants because they were seeing
a tremendous (increase) in busi-
ness due to the tax credits."


SOPHOMORE
From Page 1
tions like juniors and seniors.
"You've got these two big
clusters of opportunities for stu-
dents, and we do have a little bit
of a gap in relation to the kind of
programming we do for sopho-
mores," he said.
Sophomore Initiative has
three primary components: aca-
demic work, internship help and
experiential learning. The pro-
gram offers academic classes and
seminars catered specifically to
the needs of sophomores and has
also partnered with the Career
Center to better prepare LSA
students for internships.
Additionally, the Sophomore
Initiative program provides a
number of learning opportuni-
ties for LSA students to experi-
ence real workenvironments and

apply their liberal arts education.
Deloria said sophomore year is a
critical year in terms of choosing
a concentration, and the Sopho-
more Initiative helps to point stu-
dents in the right direction.
"We wanted to create a couple
of classes where students could
see the college and could see a
wide range of opportunities and
possibilities in a really short,
compressed period of time,"
Deloria said.
LSA sophomore Maxwell
Salvatore said he took the class
"Twenty Two Ways to Think
About Food" to help him narrow
down his concentration choices.
"I'm currently undecided, and
I thought this class was kind of
like my last chance to, you know,
get a little taste of all sorts of dis-
ciplines that are available," Sal-
vatore said. "I think it's given me
a little bit of an idea of the kind of
things that I want to do. It's cer-

tainly given me a taste of things I
don't want to do."
Salvatore participated in the
two-day food stamps challenge
and ate off $8.60 over the course
of 48 hours. During this period,
Salvatore said one of the most
important things he realized is
the importance of planning out
meals.
"As long as you really do plan,
and you don't mind cooking your
own meals, I mean it's pretty
manageable in terms of eat-
ing a variety of foods and cheap
foods," he said.
Salvatore added that he did
get hungry on the first night
and during the second day of
the experiment. However, he
said the experience wasn't long
enough to determine whether
he could actually live off food
stamps. Ultimately, Salvatore
said he was glad he participated
in the challenge.

LSA sophomore Caroline
Schiff, who is also in Deloria's
class, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that she and her friends
combined their money so they
could buy food in bulk.
"We had to make some sac-
rifices, such as buying grape
jelly instead of strawberry, so
we could save those extra 20
cents," Schiff wrote. "However,
we managed to buy a sufficient
amount of food for six meals."
She added that because of the
budget constraint, she had to eat
cheap, unhealthy food that she
usually tries to avoid.
"I prefer to eat healthy, fresh
food, which is usually more
expensive," Schiff wrote. "I also
felt more lethargic throughout
the day due to the quality of food
I was consuming."
The class that administered
the experiment features guest
lecturers from different depart-

ments within LSA, and each
guest offers a perspective on
food in relation to their areas of
study including history, political
science, physics and economics.
Schiff, said in a separate
interview that even though she
has already declared her major,
she still thought she could gain
something from the class.
"I kind of wanted a class that
was different from my major and
anything I've ever taken," Schiff
said. "I like how there's a differ-
ent lecturer every class and how
they give a different perspective
on food."
Though LSA is a liberal arts
institution, Deloria said many
students don't get the full ben-
efit of liberal arts program-
ming because they are often too
focused on finding a concentra-
tion. One of the objectives of the
Sophomore Initiative, he said, is
to help students understand the

benefits of having a liberal arts
education.
"We wanted to sort of have
some courses where we tried to
prepare students better to sort
of say, you know, 'Here's who I
am, here's what I did while I was
here, here's how it translates into
my success,"' Deloria said.
Margot Finn, a lecturer I
in American Culture, is also
teaching a Sophomore Initiative
class about food titled, "Much
Depends Upon Dinner." Finn
said looking at food from a mul-
tidisciplinary perspective is an
effective window into different
fields of study. She describes her
class as a food studies course,
which examines food from a cul-
tural perspective.
"What's interesting to me
about food is that it's both
incredibly personal, and we
interact with it on a daily basis,"
Finn said.

DUELING
COLUMNS
In the week leading up to the Michigan-Michigan State football
game each year,football writers from the Daily and the student
newspaper at Michigan State exchange columns. As the teams
prepare to clash in East Lansing, here's this year's installment:
The Michigan Daily's Michael Florek: J The State News's Anthony Odoardi:

Congratulations, Michigan
State. You did it.
For the 115 years since
you started playing football,
you've been obsessed with wag-
ing an imaginary battle against
Michigan. Your original fight song
included lines of "smash through
that line of
blue" and
"Michigan is
weakening."
Your name r
as the Spar-
tans came
as a direct
response to MICHAEL
Michigan FLOREK
being s called
the "Athens of
the Midwest" (Athens and Sparta
were rival city-states in ancient
Greece. Wikipedia it. I hear that
always works for class.)
And after beating Michigan a
trio of times, during the worst
three-year stretch in program
history, you have your rare
moment of attention. Hell, if you
ignore Michigan's edge in the
all-time series, 67-31-5, you could
even say Michigan State has
turned the tide of the rivalry.
The Wolverine fanbase cares
about you marginally more than
Notre Dame! Time to party!
But seriously, here's the bot-
tom line: The three losses to the
Spartans have derailed Michigan's
seasons. And no one in the class of
2012 wants to be in the fourth-
ever senior class that never beat
Michigan State. We care.
The funny thing is, no one else
does.
I was at last year's game. I saw
Edwin Baker rush for 149 yards
and two touchdowns. I saw the
Spartans celebrating and heard
your chants. As I went home and
flipped on the television I caught
ESPN between games and expect-
ed the worst. They were airing
College Football Live.
There was no talk of a dominant
4Spartan defense or Baker or Kirk
Cousins. Everything centered on
the play of a certain dreadlocked
quarterback.
Despite being 11-1 and co-co-
Big Ten Champions by the end of
the year, those final BCS standings
had you at No. 9, behind two-loss
Arkansas and two-loss Oklahoma.
As your coach tried to drum up
support for * bid to a BCS Bowl
anyway, few outside of East Lan-
sing came to his support. Why?
Everybody knew the same thing.
Sometimes Sparty looks like a
big boy, sometimes it even plays
like a big boy. But don't let Sparty

get too far away from his diapers.
Eventually, it's going to crap its
pants. When it happens later than
usual, like last season, usually it
happens twice. Iowa and Alabama
know what I'm talking about.
Don't be mad. You're still
Michigan's second rival, a distant
second from Ohio State - like the
distance your defensive backs will
be trailing Denard Robinson - but
second nonetheless. You're No.
2! After the previous paragraph,
that's especially fitting.
Plus, there are good things that
come from the American public's
complete apathy toward you.
No one cares when your foot-
ball players start a brawl in the
dorm that causes your coach to
create a "zero-tolerance" policy.
Or when your starting cornerback,
Chris L. Rucker, who was involved
in said brawl, gets a drunk-driving
charge.
We care. The
funny thing
is, no one
else does.
Or when said cornerback is
released from jail on a Thursday
and your coach's "zero-tolerance"
policy means he can play two days
later in the last major challenge to
an undefeated season. Or that the
team lost the game anyway.
Even on Saturday, no one is
going to care that your "Pro-
combat" threads look like South
Florida and Colorado mixed their
uniforms together and then threw
up on them. People will keep their
laughter to themselves when you
chant "Go Green! Go White!" even
though your uniform is missing
one of the colors.
Embrace this. You need it. The
public caring means you would
actually have to live up to expec-
tations.
People would look at your
schedule and realize it is just as
bad as Michigan's and realize that
the offensive line looks, well, like
a bigger sieve than Drew Palmi-
sano in the Big Chill. They'd be
surprised when you crapped your
pants.
It's not worth all that. Keep
your diapers on, Little Brother.

What's more sickening?
That Michigan is
ranked No.11 in the
country, or that I offer the news-
paper I saw those rankings in as
toilet paper for my apartment?
(No, it's not the Michigan Daily.
But if you have any extras, I'll
take them.)
The AP
needs the Red
Sox treatment
after that
one. Clear
house. Give
those votes
to someone ANTHONY
unbiased, ODOARDI
who doesn't
believe Mich-
igan should jump seven places
because they beatthe Big Ten's
worst team, 58-0.
Big win against Minnesota,
huh? Well, I guess if you don't
count their losses to New Mexico
State, North Dakota State and
Purdue - another poor Big Ten
team - it's justified.
But you know what, we're OK
over here in East Lansing. It will
just make it that much sweeter
Saturday, when the "Little Sister"
chants ring throughout Spartan
Stadium (thanks for that Mike
Hart, how's Eastern Michigan
going for you? And what the
hell is a quality control coach?)

and Paul Bunyan look-alike Joel
Foreman hoists the trophy for a
fourth straight year.
I know, I know, then we will
go drink and party and riot and
burn couches and (insert bad joke
here). Your insults remind me of
your co-eds: No matter how hard
they try, they still look like Rosie
O'Donnell.
You find your jokes about us to
be funny and insulting. We just
find them funny.
It's one ofthosethings
where your buddies will go
"OOOOOOH, BURNED!" and
then you start to think about it
and say, "Wait? They actually
party AND have girls that don't
look like Kelly Osbourne in East
Lansing?!"
Still, you Wolverines think
you just do it so much better
down there in Ann Arbor.
But I can go on for hours
with the routine stuff, how the
girls are ugly, how the team is
overrated and how they actu-
ally have the audacity torefer to
themselves as "The Harvard of
the Midwest," but I want to get
to what really bothers me about
U-M.
I sent outa text to my friends
yesterday with one simple
request: "Tell me why you hate
Michigan." And in each one of
their responses was the word

"entitle

'M' defense tasked with slowing diverse Spartan offense

By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Something in the East Lan-
sing air changes during Michigan
week.
At Spartan Stadium, the shoes
are laced up a little tighter and
the pads crack a little harder, as
the Michigan State football team's
intensity picks up.
During the Spartan Marching
Band's rehearsals next door on
Dem Field, the fight song's stac-
cato strain, "Go right through
for MSU," shifts to, "Smash right
through that line of blue."
By Saturday's kickoff, the city
reaches a fever pitch to welcome
the 11th-ranked Wolverines.
And once the teams take the
field in front of 75,000-plus fans
in East Lansing on Saturday, it's
that "line of blue" - Michigan's
defensive line - that will have the
toughest task in the rivalry game.
No. 23 Michigan State (1-0 Big
Ten, 4-1 overall) boasts an offen-

ine defense.
When the Spartans visited Ann
Arbor last seasdn, they trampled
over Michigan's front line, rush-
ing for 249 yards and three touch-
downs. Coming off a shared Big
Ten Championship season in 2010,
even with a weak offensive line,
Michigan State will pound the line
of scrimmage. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke expects nothing less.
"They're going to be physical
up front, they're going to run the
power, they're going to run the
outside stretch play," Hoke said on
Monday. "The three backs are all
really capable of hurting you."
Michigan's defense has been
notoriously bad in first halves
this season, but spectacular in the
second half. The Wolverines (2-0,
6-0) have allowed 54 first-half
points and just 21 in the second
half.
Against the Spartans, that
inconsistency won't work. It starts
with stoppingthe run.
"That's what a great defense

is built on," Michigan defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison said
on Tuesday. "You can measure a
defense on how they stop the run
in my mind.
"We'll get challenged. That's
what it's going to be. They can
throw it, too. It's not like we can
put 10 guys up there (on the line).
This is going to be another test."
The Michigan-Michigan State
rivalry game was named the
Davey O'Brien National Quarter-
back Award Marquee Matchup of
the Week, pitting Cousins against
Michigan junior quarterback
Denard Robinson.
"(Cousins) was good last year,"
Mattison said. "I think he's really
good this year. ... Anybody that
wins as many games as he's won,
you're a good quarterback."
After watching film, Mattison
determined Cousins's favorite
target, senior wide receiver B.J.
Cunningham, is "a big-time wide
receiver" with NFL-type talent.
Cousins and Cunningham

have connected 38 times this
season, averaging 116 yards per
game. Michigan's secondary
had its tune-up for Cunningham
when Notre Dame wide receiver
Michael Floyd collected 159 yards
in the second game of the season.
But during Michigan week,
anything can happen. Over in East
Lansing, the final change falls into
place. On Dem Field, the march-
ing band makes one last fight-song
alteration in the line, "See, their
team is weakening."
"Michigan is weakening, we're
going to win this game," the Spar-
tan brass chant. "Fight. Fight.Rah,
team, fight. Victory for MSU."
After never beating the Spar-
tans, Michigan's seniors have one
last chance to topple them on Sat-
urday. And it's the defense's job
to force the rivalry back in the
Wolverines' favor. Until then, the
Paul Bunyan Trophy, given to the
winner of the annual rivalry game,
will rest in East Lansing with the
Spartan victors.
