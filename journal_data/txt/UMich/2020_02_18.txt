The co-founder and former CEO 
of Clinc, an Ann Arbor artificial 
intelligence 
startup 
with 
ties 
to the University of Michigan’s 
College of Engineering, is facing 
claims of sexual harassment. Jason 
Mars’s behavior was investigated 
after Clinc received two official 
complaints from employees in 
December. He stepped down as 

CEO Feb. 10 in response to the 
investigation.
An article published in The 
Verge Thursday morning detailed 
reports of sexually inappropriate 
behavior from Mars, who is 
currently 
a 
tenured 
associate 
professor of electrical engineering 
and computer science at the 
University and the co-director of 
the University’s Clarity-Lab, an AI 
research group. The Verge based 
its reporting on accounts from 13 
current and former employees, 

including some who studied under 
Mars at the University, in addition 
to leaked phone calls, emails and 
documents.
Mars founded Clinc in 2015 
with his wife Lingjia Tang and 
University 
alumni 
Michael 
Laurenzano 
and 
Johann 
Hauswald. The company, which 
creates intelligent chatbots, has 
worked with clients including 
Ford, Sprint and USAA and has 
raised approximately $60 million 
in investments. 

Clinc has a close relationship 
with 
the 
University. 
Mars 
currently 
teaches 
EECS 
498, 
section 3, a conversational artificial 
intelligence class that uses Clinc’s 
platform. Tang is also a computer 
science professor at the University. 
The 
claims 
against 
Mars 
published by The Verge describe 
verbal and physical harassment 
of Clinc employees and business 
partners, as well as misuse of 
company funds.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Witness 
Lab 
is 
an 
architectural 
courtroom 
installation 
and 
a 
performance 
series 
by 
Courtney 
McClellan, 
Roman J. Witt Artist in 
Residence at the School of 
Art & Design. On Feb. 17, 
about 100 people attended 
the Artist Talk featuring 
McClellan, hosted by the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
Museum 
of 
Art, 
which 
explored 
the 
role 
of 
witnesses in society and 
how 
humans 
understand 
truth in our legal system. 
From February to May, 
Witness 
Lab 
will 
host 
a series of public trial 
simulations, theater and 
trial advocacy workshops 
that invite the audience to 
reflect on the role of truth 
in society. Art & Design 

students 
will 
document 
the performances through 
drawing, photography, text 
and video. The accumulated 
products will result in the

McClellan 
talked about her upbringing 
in a community of lawyers 
and 
teachers 
and 
her 
experience 
studying 
journalism at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel 

Hill. She acknowledged that 
though she did not pursue 
a 
career 
in 
journalism, 
journalistic methodologies 
have stayed with her and 
became an integral aspect 
of her artistic production. 
When she was teaching at 
the University of Georgia, 
McClellan said she followed 
and observed the mock trial 
team for three years.

Mobilize, a Central Student 
Government party “dedicated to 
running a campaign that prioritizes 
and empowers the voices of all 
students,” announced its intention 
on Monday night to have a slate 
of students seek CSG seats in the 
March election. Mobilize is the first 
party to publicly share its formation.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Amanda 
Kaplan, 
Mobilize’s 
presidential 
candidate, said she and her vice 
presidential candidate, LSA junior 
Sav Nandigama, will operate as a 
team if elected. Kaplan said their 
campaign is about listening to 
student voices and this theme starts 
at the top of the ticket.
“It’s not one person at the top 
of a ticket saying I want to run for 
president, now let me find a team 
of people behind me,” Kaplan 
said. “Sav and I literally sat in a 
room together, decided together 
that we wanted to run and then 
said, ‘Okay, let’s flip a coin and see 
who’s going to be president and 
vice president,’ because, to us, it’s 
truly a partnership, and it’s really 
emblematic of the way that we’re 
running our campaign, where it’s 
not just about one person or an 
executive ticket.

‘U’ professor faces allegations of 
sexual harassment, abusive behavior

Jason Mars, CEO of artifical intelligence startup Clinc, steps down from 
executive position in response to multiple misconduct accusations

The University of Michigan’s 
Residential College hosted a talk 
in East Quadrangle Residence 
Hall on Monday with Catherine 
Badgley, director of the RC and 
head of the Science, Technology 
and Society program. The RC is 
a multidisciplinary liberal arts 
program within the College of 
LSA and is one of LSA’s Michigan 
Learning Communities. 
The 
event 
facilitated 
conversations 
about 
building 
community, increasing diversity 
and exploring the identity of the 
RC. About 10 members of the RC 
community attended the event, 
including students, faculty and 
staff. 
The 
discussion 
began 
with attendees sharing their 
interpretations 
of 
what 
the 
identity of the RC truly is. Badgley 
commented on the curiosity and 
open-mindedness of RC students. 
“I find RC students extremely 
curious,” Badgley said. “Despite 
the fact that I think we have a 
reputation of being kind of on 
a certain part of the political 
spectrum, I also find RC students 
fairly open-minded in terms of 
being willing to consider a wide 
range of ideas.”

SACUA chair 
talks Philbert 
investigation, 
student voting 

The University of Michigan 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs met at 
Palmer 
Commons 
Monday 
afternoon to discuss how to 
increase 
civic 
engagement 
on campus in advance of the 
upcoming primary elections.
SACUA Chair Joy Beatty 
first 
began 
the 
meeting 
by 
addressing 
the 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 
against Martin A. Philbert, 
provost and executive vice 
president 
for 
academic 
affairs. She said she emailed 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel before this meeting 
regarding the matter, then 
read from his response to her 
email.
“While the allegations are 
serious, 
the 
investigation 
being 
conducted 
by 
an 
independent 
outside 
law 
firm is not yet complete and 
everyone 
should 
reserve 
final judgments until that 
point,” 
Beatty 
read 
from 
Schlissel’s 
email. 
“We 
all 
need to encourage people to 
come forward if they have 
any information on prohibited 

conduct. The fact that people 
came 
forward 
to 
report 
misconduct is a positive sign.”
Beatty 
also 
explained 
changes 
proposed 
by 
the 
Senate Assembly, including 
the 
realignment 
of 
the 
committees. Instead of having 
nine 
standing 
committees 
as there are now, the Senate 
Assembly proposed to move to 
six standing committees and 
one ad hoc committee, which 
gathers only as needed.
“The downside of having 
an ad hoc committee is that if 
you got something that needs 
to be done quickly and you got 
to pull together a committee, 
I think it will be difficult,” 
Beatty said. “It seems like 
a type of committee where 
it would really help to have 
people who have the expertise 
(on 
the 
bylaws), 
whether 
they’re from law, from policy 
or some unit like that.”
Gina 
Cervetti, 
associate 
professor 
of 
the 
School 
of Education and chair of 
Student Relations Advisory 
Committee, 
discussed 
the 
committee’s 
role 
in 
civic 
engagement on campus.

Artist Leslie Sobel displays her work, titled “Shrines & Reliquaries: Memorizing Climate,” at the A. Alfred Taubman Health Center. The collection of mixed media boxes, using various 
mediums of painting, monotype, photography, and more, each showcase places being altered by climate change. The collection is being displayed though March 6, 2020. 

Mars reacts to allegations 
One allegation detailed in The 
Verge comes from one of Mars’s 
former doctoral students, who 
worked at Clinc alongside his 
girlfriend. He claimed Mars made 
inappropriate comments about 
his girlfriend at an event at Revel 
and Roll bowling alley. Allegedly, 
Mars said she had a “nice ass,” 
asked if she “shaved” and said, 
“She can sit on my face.” 
The source, identified as Ryan 
in The Verge’s article, spoke to The 
Daily and corroborated this story, 
adding Mars’s wife was in earshot 
when Mars spoke inappropriately 
about Ryan’s girlfriend and did 
not speak up. He also clarified 
when he and his girlfriend left 
Clinc after the incident, his 
girlfriend explained to Mars and 
Tang why she was leaving, so the 
pair has been explicitly aware of 
Mars’s misconduct since June 
2017, according to Ryan.
Ryan said since leaving Clinc, 
he’s become more aware of what 
a toxic environment the company 
was. 
“Every weird way he acted 
towards people, I realized it was all 
just a sociopathic manipulation,” 
Ryan said. 
Another Clinc employee told 
The Verge she was groped and 
verbally harassed by Mars at a 
bar during a business trip to San 
Francisco. She said she did not 
report the incident out of fear of 
losing her job. 
Employees 
claimed 
a 
comparable incident happened 
on a business trip to San Antonio, 
during which Clinc was working 
on a project with one of its clients, 
USAA. At a social event at a bar, 
Mars allegedly groped a female 
USAA employee and told her, “I 
want to do nasty things to you.”
The female employee did not 
report the harassment to USAA. 
She told The Verge she did not 
want an HR investigation on her 
employee record. 
The 
Verge’s 
article 
also 
described 
some 
instances 
of 

conversations 
that 
crossed 
professional 
boundaries. 
For 
instance, Mars allegedly asked 
employees to name their sexual 
fetishes at a social event at his and 
Tang’s house. 
Sam, a former Clinc intern 
and 
full-time 
employee 
kept 
anonymous in this article due to 
fear of retaliation, confirmed this 
story in an interview with The 
Daily. He said he was an intern at 
the time, and the event shook his 
admiration for Mars. He also said 
when Ryan, who was also present 
at the social event, called Mars out 
for acting inappropriately, Mars 
shrugged it off.
“I just remember him leaning 
into me, and he’s like, ‘So, tell me 
about your sexual fetishes,’” Sam 
said. “I just kinda made something 
up and it went around the circle.”
Mars provided The Daily with a 
statement on Saturday afternoon. 
In an email to The Daily, he denied 
all accusations and emphasized 
the findings of the investigation 
into the two legal claims against 
him. 
“I vehemently deny any and all 
allegations of sexual misconduct,” 
Mars wrote. “Moreover, many of 
the allegations made about me are 
without merit or are fabrications. 
The outside investigator hired 
by Clinc’s board concluded that 
certain events that were alleged 
did not happen as claimed, and 
that allegations of retaliation 
were without merit. I valued my 
relationships with my colleagues 
and have the utmost respect for 
the men and women with whom I 
worked on a daily basis.”
Mars added there have been 
no complaints against him from 
University students. 
“To 
date, 
there 
are 
no 
complaints 
at 
the 
University 
of Michigan from anyone who 
was/is my graduate student nor 
undergraduate students in my 
class,” he wrote. “As there’s been 
no complaints from my students, 
there also isn’t and has never 
been any investigations into my 
conduct with students at the 
University throughout my years of 
service.” 
Tang did not respond to The 

Daily’s request for comment.
The recent investigation was 
prompted by two legal claims 
against Mars. One of these 
claims came from Brian Rider, 
vice president of innovation and 
strategy at Clinc. According to a 
letter from Rider’s lawyer, on a 
November 2019 business trip to 
San Francisco, Mars showed Rider 
pornographic videos and asked 
Rider to watch him receive oral 
sex from a prostitute. In its article, 
The Verge published a recording 
of a conversation between Mars 
and Rider regarding this incident.
In response to the official 
claims 
that 
surfaced 
in 
December, public relations firm 
MWWPR conducted a five-week, 
independent investigation into 
Clinc, interviewing 17 current and 
former employees and reviewing 
materials such as emails and 
company reports. 
According to a statement from 
MWWPR, the specific allegations 
being addressed did not occur as 
claimed, but the investigation did 
illuminate some misbehavior.
“The investigation did highlight 
instances where behavior has 
been a distraction to the success 
of Clinc and also concluded 
that 
complaints 
concerning 
such behavior were promptly 
addressed by Clinc leadership,” 
the statement reads.
After stepping down as CEO 
Monday and leaving Tang and 
Laurenzano as interim co-CEOs, 
Mars, 
in 
a 
company 
email, 
criticized the allegations but 
acknowledged he had crossed 
some boundaries.
“Although 
the 
allegations 
against 
me 
are 
rife 
with 
embellishments and fabrications 
some of which came out in the 
investigation, the truth is there 
were cases where I drank too 
much and partied with employees 
in a way that’s not becoming of 
a CEO,” the email reads. “I’ve 
learned a hard lesson about seeing 
my employees as friends and the 
importance of setting proper 
boundaries 
when 
socializing 
outside the workplace.”
Clinc did not respond to The 
Daily’s requests for comment in 

time for publication. 
Clinc 
employees 
describe 
toxic company culture 
Jordan, a University senior 
who asked to remain anonymous 
due to fear of retaliation and will 
be referred to using a pseudonym, 
interned at Clinc. They said the 
stories presented in The Verge 
did not come as a surprise. In 
fact, Jordan said they had heard 
of all the allegations in The Verge 
article.
“When this article came out, 
the scariest part was that none of 
it was news to me,” Jordan said. 
According to Jordan, Mars’s 
alleged 
misbehavior 
was 
common knowledge among Clinc 
employees.
“It was just kind of company 
folklore to hear all these stories 
about him,” Jordan said. “I think 
everyone at the company heard the 
story about him sexually assaulting 
a customer one time, and it was just 
kind of thought of as, ‘Oh, this is our 
CEO, this is what he does and we 
have to deal with it.’”
Another 
former 
Clinc 
employee, referred to as Emily for 
the sake of anonymity, said she 
also heard about several instances 
of sexual harassment during her 
time at Clinc. She said she would 
deliberately avoid having to spend 
time with Mars — and Tang — 
one-on-one or outside of work.
Jake, an LSA student who 
interned at Clinc, said he knew 
about 
two 
of 
the 
incidents 
mentioned in The Verge article, 
including 
the 
one 
involving 
Ryan. Others came as a surprise, 
though he didn’t see them as out 
of character for Mars. 
Jake said he first noticed Mars’s 
inappropriate behavior while at a 
bar with Mars, alleging that Mars 
drunkenly tried to convince a 
married Clinc employee to have 
sex with someone else. 
“He was very lecherous in his 
behavior, talked about women in a 
demeaning manner,” Jake said. “I 
was an intern, I didn’t know what 
to do. I wanted to call him out for 
it, but at the same time, it’s like, 
this is my livelihood, this is my 
job, I don’t want to get fired.”

“Even 
though 
just 
inherently in this mock trial 
room, learning that cases 
weren’t finite and outcomes 
were 
creative 
and 
many 
different things could happen 
inside them — after this long 
observation, I knew as an artist 
I must turn to some kind of 
action,” McClellan said. 
McClellan 
also 
explored 
the 
role 
of 
storytelling 
in 
a 
courtroom 
and 
how 
it 
contributes to the infinite 
uncertainty 
of 
truth. 
She 
said she sees litigation as a 
place where storytelling and 
performance intersect.
She also said she considers 
“liveness” vital to a courtroom. 
McClellan 
suggested 
that the act of witnessing 
contributes to a collective 
narrative in the legal space 
and that this public gesture 

is just as important as the 
performers in the trials. She 
said the openness of this space 
plays an important role in its 
subjectivity, which shows that 
truth is not an absolute but 
rather something people share 
with each other. 
“Witness is a powerful act. 
Witness is a presence but also 
a retelling,” McClellan said. 
“It’s active and social and 
political in nature.”
After the Artist Talk, the 
audience headed to the Irving 
Stenn, Jr. Family Gallery to 
experience the performance 
itself. 
Different 
from, 
yet 
imitative, of the traditional 
courtroom, Witness Lab was 
painted in a shade of light blue 
with counsel tables on both 
sides. 
Camille Casemier, School 
of Art & Design and Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
junior, 
said she has been a huge fan 
of McClellan’s work and is 
interested in her research-

based art.
“The interaction in between 
the 
courtroom 
and 
the 
religious space is something 
that I wasn’t really aware of 
so I thought that was really 
interesting,” Casemier said. 
“As an artist who also likes 
to do a lot of research, it felt 
really affirming to hear (from) 
someone a lot further along in 
their career.”
Conner 
Darling, 
a 
performance 
artist 
and 
University alum, expressed his 
interest in public ritual and 
McClellan’s medium of art. 
“I 
enjoyed 
her 
point 
about 
simulation 
versus 
reenactment,” Darling said. 
“Simulations 
can 
allow 
anything to happen effectively 
and a lot of what she has 
done is creating the space for 
things to happen as opposed to 
prescribing certain events.”

Despite the common recognition 
of Mars’s alleged misbehavior, 
Jordan 
said 
employees 
felt 
uncomfortable speaking up about 
Mars.
“The company had such a 
culture where we were kind of 
trapped and we couldn’t really say 
anything about it and bring up that 
it was so fucked up,” they said. 
Jake agreed, noting employees 
wouldn’t speak up because they 
didn’t want to lose their jobs and 
the company was doing well. 
Sam echoed this, saying the 
company was lucrative and many 
of the employees had strong stock 
options. 
Sexual misconduct was not the 
only trouble with Clinc’s culture, 
Jordan said. They claimed Mars 
was prone to angry outbursts at 
employees, and he and Tang would 
engage in intense fights at work. 
Other sources The Daily spoke 
to supported this claim. Ryan 
suggested the fighting was a tool 
Mars and Tang used to intimidate 
employees. 
“It was marital spats, but to an 
absolutely extreme degree,” Jordan 
said. “Swearing, storming out of the 
room, slamming doors. Married 
couples fight, but it was psychotic, 
almost.”
According to Jake, Mars crossed 
professional boundaries in the 
way he criticized and talked about 
employees.
“He definitely talked about 
employees in a very unprofessional 
manner,” Jake said. “He would 
mention 
people’s 
physical 
appearances, he would mention if 
they were a good worker or a bad 
worker. He would openly talk shit 
about employees pretty regularly.”
Jake said employees would be 
prone to personal attacks for their 
mistakes and Mars’s temperament 
could change instantaneously.
“He’s very outwardly friendly, 
like ‘I’m your best friend,’” Jake 
said. “But the instant you get on 
his bad side, you do something that 
upsets him, you’re dead to him. It 
flips like a switch, it’s crazy.”
Sam supported this, saying 
the workplace environment was 
confusing because Mars and Tang 
were volatile. For instance, he noted 

Tang could be kind — even hugging 
him on his birthday — when she’d 
just been screaming at someone in 
a conference room. 
Commenting on the workplace 
dynamic at Clinc, Ryan said Mars 
and his wife would manipulate 
employees by playing “good cop, 
bad cop.”
“Once you’re on their radar, they 
choose which of them is going to be 
nice and which is going to be mean 
to you, so that they can always have 
one of their unit on your side,” Ryan 
said. 
Jordan said the toxic culture 
got to the point where employees 
would freeze upon hearing even 
a video recording of Mars’s voice, 
afraid that he was in the room. 
“His 
presence 
is 
just 
so 
dominating and it’s scary,” Jordan 
said.
A 
major 
part 
of 
Mars’s 
misbehavior, Jordan said, was 
substance use. They said alcohol 
is a focal part of Clinc’s workplace 
culture — employees store alcohol 
in the company fridge, drink during 
Friday meetings and often go to 
bars after work — and this fueled 
Mars’s toxicity. 
Jake pointed out alcohol use and 
underage drinking are common at 
many tech companies, but claimed 
Mars was unprofessional in the 
extent of his drinking. According 
to Sam, at the first retreat he went 
to, the company brought 600 cans 
of beer and seven handles of vodka. 
Emily noted Tang was a heavy 
drinker as well, participating in the 
many happy hours and after-work 
drinking sessions. She said the 
couple would often show up late to 
work as a result of their drinking. 
“They show up oftentimes late 
because they both like to drink,” 
Emily said. “And then they have all 
the liquor in the office.”
Ryan said he thinks Mars 
used alcohol as an excuse for 
inappropriate behavior. Ryan added 
he was unimpressed by a statement 
Mars made in a company email, 
saying he had stopped drinking.
Referencing the incident at 
Revel and Roll, Ryan said he does 
not believe Mars’s inappropriate 
actions can be completely pinned 
on alcohol. According to Ryan, 
Mars winked knowingly at him the 
day after the incident.
“As far as I know, on bowling 
night, he was only just drinking 

beer, so unless he slammed down 
15 beers, he shouldn’t have been 
so out of control,” Ryan said. “It’s 
definitely not that he was blackout 
drunk the night before. It’s pretty 
clear that he knew he was trying to 
manipulate me, and then the wink 
was some sort of signal.”
Sexual harassment and alcohol 
abuse aside, Clinc was rife with 
professional issues, according to 
the sources who spoke to The Daily. 
For instance, Ryan said, Mars and 
Tang would cite themselves in their 
research papers to inflate their 
citation counts. Sam added there 
was some suspicious use of funds; 
he claimed Mars and Tang used 
investor money to pay for a set of 
condos they owned downtown. 
Emily said the couple would fire 
employees often, especially when 
employees 
expressed 
concern 
about the company. Sam agreed, 
sharing a story about an intern 
who told management he was not 
interested in pursuing a full-time 
position and was immediately fired. 
Moreover, Ryan said, Mars 
would 
lie 
to 
clients 
about 
the 
capabilities 
of 
Clinc’s 
conversational AI platform. Mars’s 
exaggerations 
meant 
workers 
would have to pull all-nighters 
to deliver on his promises. Emily 
backed up this claim.
“When an investor or client 
would come in and they’d be like, 
‘Oh, it would be cool if we could do 
that,’ as soon as that would happen, 
Jason would be like, ‘Oh, we 
already have that done, it’s so super 
intelligent, just give us two days to 
get it ready,’” Ryan said. 
In addition, Ryan said Tang 
and Mars would select graduate 
students from their University lab 
that they knew they could easily 
manipulate into working overtime. 
“That’s their perfect worker, 
someone you can pressure into 
working 70 hours a week, basically 
unpaid, for the company and for 
their own research,” Ryan said. 
According to Emily, Mars would 
target lower-level employees or 
those with less power in order to 
avoid retaliation. 
“He’s smart enough to pick on 
people who are lower level than he 
is, much lower level, to avoid some 
of the allegations,” Emily said. 
Ryan, who quit shortly after the 
bowling alley incident and left his 
doctorate program, said it took him 

time to process how unhealthy the 
workplace environment at Clinc 
was. 
“It’s so multidimensional how 
toxic it is,” Ryan said. “Once you’re 
there, it kind of infects your brain 
and it takes you like two months to 
actually withdraw from it and get 
back to normal.”
Overall, Sam said, the culture 
at Clinc was complicated. The 
management’s behavior was clearly 
inappropriate, but Mars also had 
many positive attributes, according 
to Sam — for example, he worked 
hard to get talented students 
from his parents’ native Guyana 
internships at Clinc. 
“Jason’s so charismatic and so 
persuasive, he has a way of getting 
inside your head,” Sam said. “He 
has this way of looking at people 
where it’s like he’s looking into your 
soul.”
U-M responds to the claims 
against Mars
In the wake of the allegations, 
University 
students 
and 
administration are reflecting on 
Mars’s role at the University. 
Multiple 
students 
have 
commented 
on 
the 
blurred 
boundaries between Mars’s class 
and his startup. 
Taylor, who took EECS 498 in 
Fall 2019, said Mars came to about 
three to five lectures over the 
course of the semester, saddling 
another lecturer — and Clinc 
employee — with the bulk of the 
teaching. He added Mars was 
unresponsive to emails related to 
the course. 
“He was pretty explicit about 
one of the reasons he did the class 
was to try to recruit UMich CS 
undergrads to go work at Clinc,” 
Taylor said. “At the final demo, 
there was a Clinc recruiter there 
handing out business cards.”
Taylor 
said 
the 
distinction 
between Mars’s professorship and 
his outside work was hazy. 
“My kind of perception was 
something along the lines of he 
didn’t really think that the rules 
and boundaries applied to him,” 
Taylor said. 
Sam claimed Mars and Tang 
abused their ties to the University. 
For example, he said, most of Mars’s 
graduate students also worked at 
Clinc, and they felt they had to stay 
at Clinc in order to keep their spot 
in the doctorate program. 

“Jason and Lingjia had a way of 
just intertwining everything,” he 
said. 
In an email to The Daily Friday 
morning, University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald clarified Mars’s 
status as an associate professor 
remains 
unchanged. 
He 
re-confirmed Mars’s employment 
Sunday morning.
“The behavior reported in this 
story is inconsistent with the values 
in the College of Engineering and 
entire University of Michigan 
community,” Fitzgerald wrote in 
the email on Friday.
In addition to retaining his 
employment status, Mars stayed 
on as a speaker at Friday’s TEDx 
event. 
The day The Verge published its 
reporting on Thursday, an EECS 
498 instructor made a post on the 
class’s Piazza page, acknowledging 
the article and clarifying the course 
has in no way been restructured.
An EECS 498 instructor made a 
Piazza post assuring students the 
class would not be restructured 
following the allegations against 
Mars.
On Friday morning, Engineering 
professor Westley Weimer sent out 
a lengthy statement to his EECS 
481 class, addressing students’ 
concerns in light of the allegations 
against Mars and other University 
administrators and faculty. 
In his statement, Weimer said 
though 
he 
cannot 
personally 
address investigations into sexual 
misconduct claims, he has set up 
an anonymous dropbox and wants 
students to feel comfortable coming 
forward. He also noted there are 
many other issues, like wait times 
at office hours, transparency in 
hiring processes and disrespect 
towards students from course staff, 
that the CSE department needs to 
address. 
“I may not be able to personally 
affect 
university-level 
policy 
about 
sexual 
harassment 
allegations, but I am working with 
a number of faculty members 
and 
administrators 
who 
have 
generously volunteered time or 
money to address some of those 
other climate concerns,” Weimer 
wrote.
Also on Friday, computer science 
and engineering faculty released a 
statement calling for Mars to take a 
leave of absence, according to The 

Verge. The School of Information 
announced it would be suspending 
its recruiting relationship with 
Clinc.
Late Friday afternoon, the Dean 
of Engineering Alec Gallimore sent 
out an email condemning the recent 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
and stating the college would soon 
take action.
“Let me state in the clearest 
terms — the reported behaviors 
are not consistent with our values,” 
Gallimore wrote. “Although I do 
not have details to share today, I 
want to assure you that we will 
address these matters and take 
action as appropriate. We are 
working toward solutions to not 
only address immediate issues, but 
to also support a culture of respect 
within the entire College.”
In 
an 
email 
to 
CSE 
undergraduates 
Saturday 
afternoon, CSE Chair Brian Noble 
said he had taken a few steps to 
address the allegations on Friday. 
He said CSE faculty had discussed 
the department’s climate issues. In 
addition, he said he asked Weimer 
to accept a position as Associate 
Chair of Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion and had launched two 
new student committees. 
“There are profound problems 
with CSE’s climate. I know that 
there is a lot of frustration, pain and 
anger, and I share it,” Noble wrote.
 CSE Chair Brian Noble sent 
an email to undergrads Sunday 
addressing the climate in the 
program.
Jake said Mars should absolutely 
not stay on as a professor. 
“If he’s being this touchy around 
employees, I would feel incredibly 
unsafe going to an individual office 
hour with him,” Jake said. “There’s 
no positives of him staying at 
Michigan.”
Emily said she takes issue not 
only with Mars’s status at the 
University but with his wife’s 
professorship as well. Tang is 
an assistant professor, not an 
associate, and her Linkedin says 
she is currently on leave from the 
University. 
“I would not send my kids to 
a university like that, knowing 
the professors have that kind of 
conduct,” she said.

This 
committee 
consults 
with 
and 
advises 
the 
vice 
president for student life.
Cervetti said they have been 
discussing how to think about 
the election in relation to the 
campus 
climate 
and 
issues 
facing students. She has been 
particularly interested in using 
the election to help University 
students think about their role 
as citizens and as an opportunity 
to support civic conversations 
on campus. She said this might 
help U-M win the Big Ten 
Voting Challenge, a competition 
across the Big Ten Conference 
to 
increase 
student 
voter 
registration and turnout.
MaryJo Banasik, director of 
the Faculty Senate Office, said 
she wants to foster different 
ways to promote student life. She 
said she will work to promote 
democratic involvement.
“We know at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
our 
students 
are interested in all kinds of 
pathways in impacting public 
life,” Banasik said. “We will be 
focusing on voting and some of 

the key skills and commitments 
toward democratic nature.”
Banasik 
also 
discussed 
declining support for democratic 
processes. She noted 17 percent 
of U.S. residents agree the 
government can be trusted to do 
what is right always or most of 
the time.
“It’s important to mention this 
to give you a sense of, ‘Where are 
we in this context, and why is 
there renewed focus considering 
civic engagement as part of 
the 
Michigan 
education?’” 
Banasik said. “Our hope at 
Ginsberg Center and working 
with partners across campus 
and some of our national civic 
partners, we know we want 
change in that scenario, creating 
confidence in the democratic 
structures, processes, et cetera 
that go beyond voting and are 
also about discussion, dialogue 
and information in news media.” 
Erin Byrnes, leader of the 
Big Ten Voting Challenge at the 
Ginsberg 
Center, 
mentioned 
there was a large jump in voting 
in 2018 with 41 percent voting, a 
26.7 percent increase from 2014. 
“It’s a lot of great work there,” 
Byrnes said. “We nearly tripled 
our voting rate and it was kind of 

our high-in-the-sky goal … With 
the hard work of our student 
team and our staff we were able 
to do that.”
Byrnes also commented on 
the high projections for the voter 
turnout this year in the U.S.
“In looking ahead to 2020, in 
the fall, projection is around 65 
percent turnout among eligible 
turnouts which will be the 
highest turnout since 1908, so 
over 100 years,” Byrnes said. “We 
are seeing a lot of movement, a lot 
of activity, a lot of energy.”
Dave Waterhouse, associate 
director of the Ginsberg Center, 
discussed how to incorporate 
civic engagement into working 
with students. He mentioned the 
Ginsberg Center is compiling a 
group of resources for faculty 
to connect their work and 
disciplines 
to 
promote 
civic 
engagement among students in a 
nonpartisan way.
“Even 
just 
asking 
the 
questions: ‘Are you voting? 
Do you have a voting plan? 
Are you registered to vote?’ in 
your classes,” Waterhouse said. 

LSA senior Camilla Lizundia, a 
member of the RC, discussed the 
academic attributes of a typical RC 
student and the sense of community 
she felt the RC embodied. 
“When I think of an RC student, 
I think of someone who’s really 
engaged,” Lizundia said. “Someone 
who’s 
perhaps 
interested 
in 
organizing, someone who enjoys 
learning languages and who enjoys 
the arts. When I think of the RC 
as a whole, the word that comes to 
mind is community.”
Badgley further talked about 
her experience as a member of 
RC faculty and the learning that 
she feels comes with the RC 
community. 
“One comes here as a faculty 
member, as a kind of a co-learner,” 
Badgley said. “So I feel as though 
in my classes, even though it’s true 
I have some expert knowledge 
that I can impart, I try to point out 
questions and topics for which I 
don’t have the answers. Because 
I’m genuinely interested in hearing 
what my students think, and they 
often have really unusual and 
valuable insights.”

The discussion then moved 
on to talk of diversity within the 
RC. Steven Ward, an associate 
professor at the RC, commented on 
how a perceived lack of diversity 
can be attributed to the RC being 
a microcosm of the broader 
University community. 
“I do think that racial diversity 
in particular and other forms or 
types of diversity are problems 
and concerns in the RC,” Ward 
said. “And I will say that that’s also 
symptomatic of the RC, but also 
symptomatic of the University. 
Something that I think we should 
be mindful of and talk about and 
try to work on, and maybe beat 
ourselves up a little bit but not too 
much. If we want to beat up on 
somebody it should be the whole 
University.” 
Badgely 
responded 
with 
a 
comment on the active effort to 
increase diversity within faculty. 
“We are trying to be more 
proactive in hiring,” Badgley said. 
“For example, we just had a joint 
search with the English department 
for a position in creative non-fiction 
and we rewrote the job ad in a 
way that specifically encouraged 
people 
with 
experience 
with 
underrepresented minorities to 
apply. And we also sent the ad to 

60 colleges and universities that 
are especially populated with 
underrepresented minorities.” 
The discussion then moved 
to talk of alienation within the 
RC community and fitting in, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
international students. 
“Yes, we do have a very low 
retention rate,” Lizundia said. 
“But there are a lot of factors that 
go into it … I would say to be more 
specific at what I’m trying to get 
at, the international community is 
not very welcome in a lot of social 
cliques. Absolutely I think we need 
to be having more conversations 
like this, more town halls … and I 
think the addition of task courses 
is excellent but there needs to be 
more.” 
Speakers then reminisced about 
the roots and history of the RC. RC 
drama lecturer Kate Mendeloff 
talked about the tradition of 
student self-governance within the 
RC. 
“Certainly when the RC was 
founded, the students ran it,” 
Mendeloff said. “They had a 
student board that was as powerful 
in making policy as the faculty. I 
think it’s part of the tradition.”

MOBILIZE
From Page 1

It’s about a team of people working 
together, respecting one another 
and elevating each other’s voices.”
Mobilize is holding a mass 
meeting on Wednesday night in 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
building.
Kaplan has previously served 
as CSG’s vice-chair of the finance 
committee and as a member of 
the Student Organization Funding 
Committee. 
She was also chair of the Engage 
Party, headed by Ben Gerstein, 
current president of CSG and 
Public Policy junior, in last spring’s 
election and currently serves as 
chief of staff in his administration. 
Before this, Kaplan held a seat in the 
Assembly as an LSA representative. 
Nandigama 
previously 
served as CSG chief of staff in 
Daniel Greene’s administration. 
Nandigama told The Daily that 
she and Kaplan created Mobilize 

with the goal of ensuring CSG is 
listening to student voices as much 
as possible.
“We really just want people to 
feel like we’re not going to sit on 
some pedestal being president and 
vice president, but we really want 
to work with students,” Nandigama 
said. “We’re really hoping to uplift 
different student voices because it’s 
not just us at the table.”
In addition to her work in 
CSG, Nandigama noted her roles 
within the South Asian Awareness 
Network, the University’s Office 
of Undergraduate Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs and Blueprints 
for 
Pangea, 
an 
organization 
committed to mitigating medical 
resource inefficiencies. 
The party does not currently 
have a platform. On Mobilize’s 
website, it said it is meeting with 
student groups to “effectively 
grasp student needs and craft 
meaningful policy.” Mobilize is 
expecting to release a platform 
next week, though it noted it will 
be constantly changing as the party 

hears from more people.
Public Policy junior Miriam 
Chung, 
outreach 
director 
of 
Mobilize, said the party wants to 
have conversations with student 
groups before creating policies 
to bring in multiple voices and 
better integrate CSG in the campus 
community. Chung said she joined 
Mobilize because this mission 
resonated with her.
“If we’re running as a body or as 
an entity that’s really supposed to 
represent student voices, then we 
should ask them what they want, 
and then implement it into our 
policy platforms and what we’re 
really advocating for,” Chung said. 
“In turn, that really integrates a 
lot of different kinds of people and 
voices into our story.”
The website has forms for 
individual students to share ideas 
or for organizations to arrange 
meetings with party members.

T

he Saline School District 
was recently dealt a blow 
when racist incidents 
within the community made local 
and national headlines. The first 
was the discovery of a student 
Snapchat group that contained 
racial slurs and epithets like 
“White Power” and “The South 
Will Rise Again.” Students of 
color within that group chat 
reportedly 
felt 
marginalized, 
“unsafe” 
and 
“frustrated.” 
The second occurred at the 
community response to this 
development: 
At 
a 
district-
wide meeting regarding issues 
of diversity and inclusion, a 
Mexican parent was voicing 
concerns about these race-based 
incidents when another parent 
coarsely asked why he didn’t just 
“stay in Mexico.”
The 
occurrence 
of 
these 
incidents, to some community 
members, 
wasn’t 
surprising. 
But for many, it served as 
a 
community 
awakening 
to an underlying culture of 
nonchalance regarding issues 
of race, ethnicity and other 
identities among both students 
and parents. These incidents 
speak 
to 
the 
unfortunate 
spreading of racist, unwelcoming 
language that is unbecoming 
of any community, especially 
a 
school 
district. 
Students 
shouldn’t 
need 
to 
worry 
about surface threats or racist 
messages. They shouldn’t feel 
ostracized in an educational 
environment 
by 
their 
peers 
or adults in the community. 
Educational 
institutions 
and 
teachers, the enactors of the 
educational mission, should be 
bound — by the nature of the 
institution of education — to care 
for students’ complaints, level of 
comfort and overall well-being.
I’ll admit this is strange to 
think about as I’ve always been 
a believer that individuals should 
take personal responsibility for 
their actions. (My mantra, ever 

since my stints with bullying 
in middle school, has always 
been: If you have a problem, 
figure it out.) However, this idea 
isn’t functional in educational 
settings, even if it applies to life. 
Educators have important roles 
in the lives of their students as 
teachers, leaders and caretakers: 
They should take the personal 
experiences of students seriously, 
especially those dealing with 
borderline 
malicious 
things 
like what went on in Saline. 
Otherwise, 
the 
mission 
of 
educating 
students 
becomes 
seriously jeopardized. How can 
some students be expected to 
learn in an environment in which 
they aren’t treated as equals?
I internalized this idea at 
the New England Literature 
Program (NELP). This was a 
spring 
semester 
educational 
program, 
offered 
by 
the 
University of Michigan, during 
which participants study English 
literature in the woods of New 
Hampshire, 
isolated 
from 
society and functioning as a 
transcendental commune. Before 
one of the trips we took outside 
our cabin grounds, we had a 
discussion about the politics 
of New Hampshire residents 
and the chance we’d see “Make 
America Great Again” signs and 
other things that are inconsistent 
with our transcendental bubble. 
At the time, I thought this was 
a 
conversation 
appropriate 
for sheltered individuals who 
couldn’t fathom the existence of 
a politwically diverse population, 
or that someone might have 
matured into their politics by 
different and parallel means. I 
wrote in my journal that I was 
surprised that a “talk-around like 
this even needs to be done.”
There were some other acerbic 
bits of writing about this matter 
that were passionate and which 
I held true to my beliefs. But I’ve 
changed my mind on the matter, 
especially in light of these events 

in Saline and discussions had 
with fellow Daily members on the 
Editorial Board. Conversations 
like the one I had at NELP — like 
the one Saline held in response 
to the racist social media posts 
— are a necessary response to 
student experiences. They are 
not indicative of some sort of 
cultural deficiency or emotional 
weakness, rather, they’re an 
appropriate 
product 
to 
the 
cultural artifacts of this time.
Saline 
recently 
held 
an 
inclusion rally in solidarity 
with the students who felt 
marginalized 
from 
these 
mean-spirited 
messages. 
I 
commend the intention to make 
a communal effort to right 
these wrongs. To be clear, the 
school district doesn’t need 
to 
adopt 
politically 
correct 
language and get sucked into 
a race to the bottom, driven 
by identity politics. (I talk 
about the negative influence of 
identity politics on educational 
institutions 
like 
universities 
in my last column. Political 
correctness stymies free speech 
and debate because it invalidates 
ideas 
and 
individuals 
who 
don’t agree with the accepted 
dogma). This “inclusion rally” 
probably falls into the category 
of 
meaningless 
politically 
correct 
demonstrations, 
but 
it can serve as a step in the 
right direction. The school 
district needs to — rather 
than re-educate — re-engage 
students in the mission of 
educational 
community-
building by incorporating the 
values that make a community 
a virtue: trust, tolerance and 
work. An incident like this 
shouldn’t muzzle the victims, 
but encourage them to create 
useful change. I’m glad it is and 
hope it continues to be the case 
in Saline.

I

t’s no secret that Ann Arbor 
is a bastion for pizza lovers. 
Smaller places — like New 
York Pizza Depot (NYPD) or Joe’s 
Pizza — offer some great options for 
paper-thin New York-style pizza, 
while places like Pizza House and 
Cottage Inn fulfill every other pizza 
lover’s desire. Everyone has their 
favorite place, memories of nights 
with friends and delicious pizza 
attached to each one. I was shocked 
when I heard that my sacred pizza 
place, South U Pizza, was being shut 
down this past December.
I was waiting for my red-eye 
flight back home for Christmas 
when my boyfriend texted me the 
bad news. My eyes welled up with 
tears, not only due to the countless 
memories I had made there but 
for the loss of their buffalo chicken 
pizza, which was lathered in a pool 
of buffalo sauce and grease so thick 
it soaked through their paper plates. 
I mourned the death of the best pizza 
I ever had.
It was only after the loss of this 
great pizzeria that I realized how 
nostalgic a pizza pie can be. Most 
American childhoods are marked 
by this universally beloved Italian 
food, steaming on table tops at 
birthday parties and sleepovers. 
Even former President Barack 
Obama isn’t immune to the greasy 
goodness of a Little Ceasar’s Pizza, 
albeit on a sterling silver plate 
rather than a paper one.
It was way back in 2011 when 
Obama made his way to Detroit, 
a pizza mecca in its own right, for 
a pizza party fundraiser. Hosted 
by Denise Ilitch, the daughter of 
Little Ceasar’s founders Mike and 
Marion Ilitch, guests dished out 
$10,000 for dinner and a photo 
with the president. The cocktail 
reception, and the chance to talk 
to the president, set guests back 
another $30,000. These numbers 
are paltry compared to the 
millions of dollars Ilitch, the local 
philanthropist, 
businesswoman 
and 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Regent, spent to host it at her home 
in Bingham Farms.
Obama 
repaid 
Ilitch’s 
generosity in 2016, with an invite 
not to a pizza party, but to his final 
state dinner alongside celebrities 
like Gwen Stefani, Rachel Ray, 
Jerry Seinfeld and Chance the 
Rapper. It was her third time in 
the Obama White House after two 
visits with her family’s Stanley 
Cup-winning Detroit Red Wings. 
While Ilitch’s political bona fides 
and connections may seem hard to 
beat, her position is hardly unique 
among her fellow regents.

University 
Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein (D) represents another 
famous 
Michigan 
pedigree, 
appearing on my television at least 
three times during the Super Bowl 
in his family’s famous Sam Bernstein 
Law Firm commercials. University 
Regents Paul Brown (D), Michael 
Behm (D), Katherine White (D) and 
Jordan Acker (D) are also prominent 
Democratic lawyers with more 
accolades and accomplishments to 
count. But the political influence of 
the University’s Board of Regents 
isn’t limited to the Democratic party.

University Regent Ronald Weiser 
(R), the sole Republican on the 
board, served as ambassador to the 
Slovak Republic under George W. 
Bush and chairman of the Michigan 
Republican Party from 2009-2011 
and 2017-2019. In this position, he 
oversaw the red wave that flipped 
Michigan’s legislature and helped 
them maintain their death grip on it 
in the 2018 elections. After working 
to raise $1 billion for President 
Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign as 
national finance chairman of the 
RNC, he is now serving in the same 
role for the re-election campaign 
of Stephen King’s arch-nemesis, 
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Even 
Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs (D), a 
Grosse Pointe dermatologist with 
her own line of skin-care products, 
holds great political power as 
one of Michigan’s 17 Democratic 
superdelegates.
Elected 
by 
millions 
of 
Michiganders to serve their eight-
year terms, the Board of Regents is 
no ordinary school board. Besides 
the power they hold as individuals, 
regents manage the school’s roughly 
$12 billion endowment, investing 
in new programs, buildings and 
the stock market. The school’s 
Wall 
Street 
investments 
have 
proven controversial in the last few 
years. Last year, the University’s 
Central 
Student 
Government 
passed a resolution to investigate 
withdrawing 
money 
from 
businesses that work with Israel, 
citing their violations of international 
law against Palestinians. The regents 

denied it to maintain the strength 
of the investment portfolio. This 
isn’t the only time regents have 
prioritized the wishes and futures of 
donors over those of their students.
Written in chalk on buildings 
and sidewalks around campus are 
various mantras calling for the 
regents to divest the more than $1 
billion the University has invested 
in gas and oil companies, reminders 
of the Global Climate Strike this 
past September. The University 
and the Regents have ignored these 
demands and had climate protesters 
arrested at sit-ins, ensuring the 
University maintains its spot near 
the bottom of Big Ten schools when 
it comes to reducing emissions. Their 
staunch refusal has baffled teachers 
and students who expect better from 
what they thought was Michigan’s 
most 
elite 
and 
progressive 
institution.
Long seen as a role model for the 
state, the Regents’ refusal to act 
sends a message that inaction on 
this existential threat to humanity 
is fine by them. Coming from a 
group of people who have helped 
elect presidents and countless 
other government officials in 
both major political parties, this 
message is beyond worrisome 
with implications reaching far 
beyond Ann Arbor.
In an America where Citizens 
United all but ensures elections go 
to whoever has the biggest bank 
account, the positive influence 
of wealthy donors like Ilitch and 
Weiser is going to be essential in 
getting Michigan and the nation 
back on track to keep our climate 
liveable. If the Regents don’t vote 
for this essential progress in their 
official roles, then they are unlikely 
to push other people, many who rely 
on their financial support, to do the 
same.
While the Regents recently 
took a small step in the right 
direction by voting down a $50 
million investment in gas and 
oil company Vendera Resources, 
they still have a long way to go 
before they prove themselves 
to be leading us in the right 
direction. With Earth’s climate 
quickly 
reaching 
a 
tipping 
point, the Regents are shirking 
their responsibilities to their 
students 
to 
strengthen 
the 
money-making 
machine 
the 
University has become. While 
South U and their iconic buffalo 
chicken pizza may be doomed, 
our world doesn’t have to be.

S

tress is a commonality 
that 
underpins 
the 
experience of students. 
Our lives are filled with a 
multiplicity 
of 
influences, 
whether we actively recognize 
them or not. The most obvious 
and 
trendy-to-criticize 
influence is social media. The 
vast majority of students on 
campus utilize some form of 
social media, with YouTube, 
Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, 
Facebook and Whatsapp being 
some of the most popular 
platforms for young people. 
Our 24/7 access to social media 
serves as a constant connection 
to influences and an inherent 
comparison to others.
But 
the 
pressure 
goes 
beyond 
the 
media. 
“Flex 
culture,” or the desire to show 
off aspects of your identity 
like your physique, belongings 
or 
social 
connections, 
is 
apparent both on social media 
and while crossing the Diag. 
While 
cultural 
structures 
add pressure to a student’s 
role, this is only one factor of 
high expectations. Mounting 
assignments, essays and exams, 
job and internship applications, 
on-campus employment, degree 
and 
credit 
requirements, 
budgeting and student debt 
are daily challenges many of 
us face. There are explicit and 
implicit expectations students 
are pressured to meet; While 
the 
narrative 
of 
“leaders 
and 
best” 
is 
aspirational 
and motivating, the looming 
pressures of resume building 
and 
constant 
productivity 
almost certainly add anxiety to 
student experiences.
Living in Ann Arbor poses 
specific challenges as students 
transition 
from 
on-campus 
housing to living off-campus. 
The housing market is lacking in 
providing an adequate amount 
of reasonably priced proper 
living 
spaces, 
while 
high-
rises multiply and the student 
and 
working 
population 
grow. 
Renting 
practices 
are complicated by limited 
space and a short time frame 
of 
contract 
signing, 
which 
can 
expose 
vulnerabilities 
landlords tend to exploit.
There is also a noticeable 
lack of access to healthy food 
close to Central Campus; While 
you can get basic staples at 

convenience stores, to get an 
adequate amount of fresh fruit, 
vegetables and protein, students 
must travel far off-campus. 
This task is straightforward 
for students with cars or the 
financial freedom to get their 
groceries delivered to their 
door, but those who don’t 
have 
those 
resources 
must 
rely on public transportation. 
The flaws in housing, access 
to nutritious food and other 
challenges stand in the way 
of students relieving stress in 
their daily lives.

Education burnout is an 
experience shared by many 
college 
students 
striving 
for degrees. This manifests 
when the stress of school and 
time management becomes 
unbearable, draining us of 
any motivation to complete 
daily 
responsibilities, 
at 
times even bleeding into our 
health and well-being. While 
it may seem obvious, self-
care is crucial to avoid this. 
Audre Lorde, an influential 
activist and powerful orator, 
said, “Caring for myself is 
not 
self-indulgence. 
It 
is 
self-preservation, and that is 
an act of political warfare.” 
Focusing on personal well-
being is a challenge when 
students are already dealing 
with the stress of standards, 
influences, 
pressures 
and 
expectations. 
Tales 
of 
downing 
one’s 
caffeinated 
beverage 
of 
choice 
and 
pulling 
all-nighters 
before 
exams 
are 
common. 
The 
caricature of undone laundry, 
dirty 
dishes 
and 
chaotic 
living spaces are a reality for 
many. Our well-being is often 
put aside in order to prioritize 
productivity — yet this very 
act makes us less productive.
There are industries that 
directly profit by advertising 

to those who experience high 
stress 
without 
pinpointing 
the cause. Face masks and 
essential oils can help the 
symptoms, 
but 
we 
must 
address the disease itself. 
This 
commercialized 

approach 
to 
self-care 
is 
certainly beneficial to some 
but is impractical for students 
who have little free time and 
extra cash to spend. Because 
of this quixotic presentation 
of self-care in the media, 
many do not take it seriously. 
The luxury of taking time 
out of packed schedules to 
do menial tasks seems like 
a joke. It is portrayed as an 
expensive hobby rather than 
a fundamental aspect of our 
well-being — an unrealistic, 
romanticized ideal that is 
nonsensical to integrate into 
our daily lives.
Educating ourselves on the 
variety of forms of wellness 
beyond eating healthy and 
exercising shouldn’t be seen 
as a luxury, but as a mandatory 
element for our success. This 
includes 
practicing 
good 
hygiene for its positive effects 
on mental health, developing 
spirituality and maintaining 
a clean living space. For those 
who struggle with mental 
illness, these tasks can be 
daunting, 
and 
additional 
resources 
like 
Counseling 
and Psychological Services 
(CAPS) may be helpful — it 
has been beneficial for me.
Our success should not be 
defined by how many hours we 
study or how long our resumes 
are. Instead, we must recognize 
that self-care is fundamental 
to not only maintain our well-
being and happiness but to 
our academic and professional 
pursuits as well. When we 
invest in ourselves, we are 
better able to be present and 
productive 
while 
working. 
Activist Maya Angelou said it 
best: “My mission in life is not 
merely to survive, but to thrive; 
and to do so with some passion, 
compassion, some humor and 
some style.” Leaders and best, 
it is time that we do not simply 
survive 
the 
pressures 
and 
expectations of our lives. It is 
time to thrive.

One of the many pleasures 
of Andrea Lawlor’s 2017 novel 
“Paul Takes The Form Of A 
Mortal Girl” is the realization I 
came to that this novel is more 
or less unreadable by a straight 
person. 
It’s 
saturated 
with 
vivid, unsparing depictions of 
not only gay sex but also the 
ecosystem that surrounds it — 
glances and recognitions and 
guesswork, a whole network of 
affiliations and signifiers that I 
doubt anyone at all uninitiated 
would be able to wade through 
without frustration. I even have 
some queer friends who tried to 
read this book and couldn’t get 
past what one called Lawlor’s 
“vulgar” style. The expectation 
that 
we 
can 
(and, 
more 
dubiously, 
should) 
untether 
queer community from the act 
of fucking is understandable, 
but an occasional reminder of 
the particular (maybe banal) 
site of queerness restores some 
revolutionary 
potential 
to 
the thing. There’s something 
lovely, anyway, about feeling 
at home in a book that your 
straight friends would likely 
throw across the room before 
too long, to be thrilled by 
recognition and curiosity that 
feels particular. 
That being said, gayness is 
a lot more legible in the book 
than transness per se, despite 
the fact that Lawlor has become 
known as a member of a trans 

fiction-writing vanguard along 
writers like Jordy Rosenberg, 
Imogen Binnie and Casey Plett. 
That this imagined community 
is more of a listicle than a 
reality shouldn’t be that much 
of a surprise. “Trans literature” 
as a category was probably 
destined to be problematized 
out of existence before it could 
ever really come into its own. 
Transness 
was 
always 
too 
multiple and mutable to ever 
coalesce into a canon or even 
really a section of a bookshelf. 
It’s easy to see how one might 
think of this book as trans. 
Lawlor’s titular anti-hero is 
a shapeshifter whose powers 
seem to mostly exist in the 
realm of human possibility: 
He can change himself into 
a woman and can become a 
more masculine man, adding 
and shedding muscle and fat 
in various places like picking 
out an outfit. This can easily 
be read, if you only look at the 
blurb, as a liberatory allegory of 
transness, Paul’s abilities easily 
packaged into a metaphor for 
genderbending.
Lawlor doesn’t seem to see 
it that way, though: They said 
in an interview that Paul isn’t 
trans. What they have said about 
the book — that they started 
the book as a way to talk about 
“picking up people in bars,” 
that the book is a sort of time 
capsule of the ‘90s — seems to 
indicate that their goals aren’t 
to make a trans vanguard book, 
or at least not a straightforward 
one. This is apparent to anyone 
who has read more than the 
first ten pages. The opening 

fanfare, which involves Paul 
changing into his girl alter-
ego Polly and getting picked up 
by a punk rocker dyke, moves 
quickly into a sequence of Paul 

in boy-mode hooking up with 
a 
bearded 
Visiting 
Writer. 
Paul’s mores, though decidedly 
omnivorous, seem to rely on a 
sort of balance (“Paul wanted to 
fuck someone tonight, after the 

business with the rock star”). 
The fluidity is from night to 
night, not moment to moment: 
Paul is, generally, either a 
gay man or a lesbian woman. 

Lawlor’s game is something 
other than a straightforward 
valediction of gender fluidity 
as we understand it today.
Their 
interest 
seems 
like it has more to do with 

exploration, with knowledge, 
with covering as much ground 
as possible within the scope of 
the novel. That being said, it’s 
worth pointing out that the 
novel doesn’t really resemble 
any of the standard types — 
it’s not a hero’s journey or a 
bildungsroman. Lawlor said in 
an interview that they found 
some 
difficulty 
in 
writing 
Paul’s story with a conventional 
three-act structure, one that 
would involve him “learning a 
lesson.” They write: “I ended 
up doubling down on a more 
episodic structure because I 
realized my reluctance had 
to do with my understanding 
of how people change, how 
I’ve changed — really slowly, 
recursively, making the same 
mistakes over and over.” As the 
poet Brian Blanchfield pointed 
out in his excellent review in 
Bookforum, Paul’s story has 
more to do with the picaresque 
than with the bildungsroman, 
especially in that picaresque 
is a genre that calls for a 
certain kind of personality 
— 
adaptable, 
adventurous, 
forceful, wily — as well as an 
episodic approach to plot. He is 
able to read people’s affiliations 
and 
types 
based 
on 
little 
signifiers, and is also capable 
of applying the same scrutiny 
on himself. Paul is all of these 
things, an endlessly curious 
and savvy reader of people who 
is never content to stay in one 
place. His travels place him in 
dispirate places — Boystown 
in Chicago, rural lesbianism 
in Michigan and in off-season 
Provincetown, the “various” 

atmosphere of androgynous, 
utopic San Francisco. Lawlor is, 
like Paul, interested in covering 
a lot of ground, finding things 
out. Sex is one way of learning 
about people; so are long-term 
relationships and parties and 
friendships. The shapeshifting 
could, in the end, just be 
Lawlor’s way of showing us 
what else exists, giving Paul 
access both to leather bars and 
to the famously transphobic 
Michigan 
Womyn’s 
Music 
Festival. Paul isn’t transgender, 
he’s multiple.
If you’ll allow me a bit of an 
overread — reading this book 
as a bona fide transsexual 
was 
interesting 
because 
it 
reminded me that I know of 
more than one trans person 
(usually 
transmasculine) 
who refers to themselves as a 
shapeshifter. Based on several 
choices they could make, they 
could convincingly pass as one 
or the other gender. For those 
of us who are slightly gender-
ambivalent anyway, this is an 
appealing choice if you can 
pull it off, and it’s usually less 
difficult than one might think. 
Trans people, like Robin says, 
are “like everybody else, only 
more so.” We know better 
than anyone else that the line 
between genders is thinner 
than you might think, and a 
lot is possible with a certain 
attention to detail. In my case, 
sometimes I wonder what it 
would be like to have been 
predisposed to another path. 
My curiosity has never really 
metabolized into desire, but I’m 
not ruling it out. 

Like everybody else, except more so: On Andrea Lawlor

A “loomi” is the Oman word for 
a sun-dried lime: a Middle Eastern 
spice that is used as a souring agent. 
It is quite small — about the size of 
a key lime with black, pebbly skin 
— yet looming and distinct in flavor 
without being overbearing. While 
originating from Oman, loomi limes 
are used throughout the Middle 
East. You will find some loomi 
limes providing bright but subdued 
acidity in Persian stews and soups, 
a rounded sweetness to many Iraqi 
meat stuffings and a voluptous funk 
to many Arabic fish dishes. 
While Loomi Cafe may not 
always use its eponymous spice 
within its rotating menu, the flavors 
often present in the food are as 
playful as a loomi lime — titillating 
spices play behind a foreground of 
(usually citric) acidity.
Loomi Cafe is situated in a 
small diner-like space across from 
Monahan’s Fish Market inside the 
Kerrytown Market & Shops. Long 
time residents of the neighborhood 
may recall that Loomi Cafe now 
stands in the space formerly 
occupied by Kosmo’s Bop Shop, 
which has since moved to a new 
location next to Fleetwood Diner. 
Unlike its predecessor, Loomi Cafe 
defies an ethnographic label on the 
theme of food that might be served; 
A Peruvian pork or a Hyderabadi 

chicken dish presented one day may 
very well be replaced by a Nashville 
hot cauliflower dish a few days later. 
You’ll find comfort and perhaps 
a sense of relief when you learn that 
all of these entrees have something 
in common: Every entree is always 
served with your choice of fresh 
in-house pita bread, roasted (well, 

griddled) potatoes or white rice. 
Each choice of starch has its own 
unique, tantalizing voice. The pita 
bread sings in its toasty, sweet 
and near charred aroma, amidst 
its chewy texture backing track. 
The potatoes shatter with their 
glass-like crust yielding into wet 
but fluffy interiors. The rice is a 
most agreeable “fluffy bunny” 
companion to Loomi’s entrees — 

you lean toward the rice on the days 
you crave a subdued, yet fuller meal 
(probably on a rainy or snowy day).
If 
you 
find 
the 
generous 
portion sizes of Loomi’s entrees 
challenging, and perhaps would 
only like to consume a small amount 
of food, consider Loomi’s pupusas: 
a griddled, puck-like Salvadorean 
snack made out of ground corn 
oozing with delicious fillings. An 
analogue of the Korean bindaetteok, 
it resembles an amalgamation of 
a tortilla and a Hot Pocket. The 
pupusas at Loomi’s provide a 
satisfying toasted crisp exterior 
that explodes with the hot, often 
fatty, juices hiding within. While 
the pork and cheese pupusa served 
last year contained juicy chunks of 
pork with intermittent salty globs 
of cheese, the current chicken and 
beans pupusa served recently shows 
a more delicate, fluffier interior. A 
good pupusa is always handmade 
to order; the pat-pat-pat of the cook 
preparing your pupusa comforts 
you as you settle in at the counter, 
salivating in anticipation.
After multiple visits, you find 
clarity in the theme and vision 
among Loomi’s food. Each starch 
option (whether pita, potato, rice or 
masa) is like an Avenger: It possesses 
its own delicious superpowers and 
characteristics uniquely catered 
to different palates. Loomi Cafe, 
therefore, is the Avenger’s Tower: 
all forms of starches assemble at the 
counter to save your day.
Loomi Cafe is located at 407 N 5th 
Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.

Going into “Downhill,” I was 
most intrigued not by the fact 
that it is a remake of a popular 
foreign film, or that it stars top-
tier talents like Julia Louis-
Dreyfus (“Veep”) and Will Ferrell 
(“Anchorman”). When I saw the 
trailer, the first thing I said was, 
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a 
movie about skiing before.”
The premise of “Downhill” is 
simple enough: a family on a ski 
trip in the Alps is threatened by 
an apparent avalanche. The main 
source of tension, however, is the 
priorities between husband Pete 
(Ferrell) and wife Billie (Louis-
Dreyfus) Staunton. As a cloud 
of snow approaches, Billie grabs 
Finn (Julian Grey, “Godless”) and 
Emerson (Ammon Jacob Ford, 
“Seal Team”), their two kids. 
Pete, on the other hand, grabs his 
phone and runs away. This split-
second fight-or-flight decision 
settles into a rift that sends the 
family into disarray.
Despite never having met 
before 
joining 
the 
project, 
Louis-Dreyfus and Ferrell are 
convincing as a couple. Pete and 
Billie feel very real as a married 
couple that has been together for 
so long that they have fallen into 
a rhythm. In one scene, they sit 
on the hotel bed eating french 
fries. In another, they brush their 
teeth in front of the sink, ducking 
and weaving around each other 

with perfect timing. But after the 
near-miss with the avalanche, 
and after Pete refuses to admit 
his cowardice, they lose their 
rhythm.
Watching the conflict play 
out on the stunning background 
of the Alps is surreal. My family 
has gone skiing every year since I 
was four, so many of the “family 
ski trip” aspects felt true to me, 
whether it’s one sibling dive 
bombing down the mountain 
while the other takes his time 
or a family game of Uno in front 
of the fireplace. But this is what 

gives “Downhill” its footing: it is 
a movie that is real and relatable, 
both in its comedy and its conflict.
The film is a remake of the 
Swedish film “Force Majeure,” 
a dark comedy that won critical 
acclaim and fan support back 
in 2014. “Downhill” was five 
years in the making, after “Force 
Majeure” director Ruben Östlund 
encouraged creating an American 
version of the film. As a result, 
this version in much lighter, 
finding comic relief during tense 
sequences via certain characters: 

Charlotte (Miranda Otto, “The 
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”), 
a woman at the ski resort with 
a shameless tendency for blunt 
and shocking declarations, and 
Zach 
(Zach 
Woods, 
“Silicon 
Valley”), Pete’s work friend who 
is hilariously bad at handling 
awkward 
situations, 
are 
particularly funny, as well as a 
brusque member of ski patrol 
played by Kristofer Hivju (“Game 
of Thrones”), a Norwegian actor 
who also appeared in “Force 
Majeure.” Still, there is something 
that seems to have been lost 
in translation, something that 
makes “Downhill” feel like it’s 
missing a beat.
Despite the comic relief and 
the acting backgrounds of its 
main 
actors, 
“Downhill” 
is 
not purely comedic. Ferrell’s 
tendency 
to 
play 
absurd 
characters is thinly veiled by 
his portrayal of Pete, who finds 
himself struggling to reconcile 
his current place in life with what 
he really wants. Louis-Dreyfus’s 
tangible emotions hold the film 
together, whether they are a 
well-crafted facial expression 
or the cracks in her voice as she 
explains the avalanche event to 
Zach and his girlfriend Rosie 
(Zoë Chao, “Strangers”). These 
performances, 
particularly 
Louis-Dreyfus’, 
turn 
this 
married couple into a pair of 
characters that are flawed and 
relatable.

For those of us who are slightly 
gender-ambivalent anyway, this is 
an appealing choice if you can pull it 
off, and it’s usually less difficult than 
one might think. Trans people, like 
Robin says, are “like everybody else, 
only more so.” We know better than 
anyone else that the line between 
genders is thinner than you might 
think, and a lot is possible with a 
certain attention to detail.

It’s no shock that Carly Pearce 
released her self-titled sophomore 
album on Valentine’s Day. She tied 
the knot with fellow country artist 
Michael Ray last October and hasn’t 
been very shy about her feelings for 
him on social media. It makes sense 
that her starry-eyed Instagram 
posts would carry over to her music. 
Luckily for listeners though, Carly 
Pearce isn’t mushy gushy, but open-
hearted. 
Sure, this album is stocked with 
its fair share of love songs. The 
most conventional of these sounds 
so sweet it feels sour: On “Finish 
Your Sentences” Pearce and her 
husband alternate verses, proving 
that they literally have the ability 
to accomplish the title’s cliche. 
It should be cute, but when the 
answers to questions like “Should I 
wear this dress?” are obvious, it just 
comes off as trying too hard.
On “Closer to You,” “Call Me” 
and “You Kissed Me First” Pearce is 
far more in her element: flirtatious, 
lively and light-hearted. Using these 

songs, one could easily trace the 
beginnings of her love story with 
her husband. That’s why it’s a little 
off-putting to discover that Pearce 
didn’t write any of them.
On an Instagram post for “You 
Kissed Me First,” Pearce wrote 
that she felt like songwriter Hillary 
Lindsey had written her story for 
her. Even though there’s a certain 
expectation in country music that 
singers write their own material, 

Pearce’s choice to cut these tracks 
is commendable. She isn’t going 
to stop herself from singing a song 
that suits her just because she didn’t 
write it.
The stand out track is a song that 
Pearce did have a hand in writing — 
it’s about an ex. On “I Hope You’re 
Happy Now,” a soaring duet with 
Lee Brice, Pearce takes all the blame 

for the failed relationship. “It’s all on 
me / it’s my mistake / I said ‘I don’t 
love you’ a little too late,” she admits.
The 
album’s 
throughline 
is 
Pearce’s vulnerability. Everyone 
loves a good party song or a bit of 
alcohol-related word play, but it’s 
refreshing that Pearce didn’t lean 
on either common country music 
crutch to compile her record. 
Because country radio’s airwaves 
are male-dominated and beer-
loving, not playing into that kind of 
song is a risk. One that Pearce makes 
the most of. 
For 
every 
party 
song 
slot 
she sacrifices, Pearce flexes her 
storytelling skills. “Woman Down” 
is a high-stakes late night drive 
following a woman “down on her 
luck.” “Dashboard Jesus” is a sunny 
update to “Jesus Takes the Wheel.” 
And the most personal song on 
the album, “It Won’t Always Be 
Like This” catches Carly in the 
strangeness of feeling nostalgic for 
both the past and present. Anyone 
can (and pretty much everyone 
does) sing about love, but stories are 
a more difficult feat.

Pearce is open-hearted on 
self-titled sophomore LP

BIG MACHINE

KATIE BEEKMAN
Daily Arts Writer

Inside the Newman Studio 
of the Walgreen Drama Center, 
two rows of actors wearing 
white face paint silently sat 
facing each other on either side 
of an empty black stage, while 
audience members filtered in. 
This was the student-run theatre 
organization 
Basement 
Arts’ 
“Spring Awakening,” the original 
play written by Frank Wedekind 
in 1906 from which the 2006 hit 
Broadway rock musical of the 
same name took inspiration. But 
the viewer experience was far 
from the same.
The 
play 
follows 
several 
interwoven stories of teenagers 
growing up in an oppressive 
provincial 
Germany 
in 
the 
late 1800s. They grapple with 
newfound 
and 
unexplained 
sexual desires, spar with their 
parents and face the crushing 
pressure to succeed in school, 
all while struggling with their 
new identities as young adults. 
“Spring Awakening” is famous 
for dealing with teen sexuality, 
suicide and the dangers that 
institutionalized pressure and 
silence can have on young people.
To no fault of Basement 
Arts, the major downfall of this 
production was the writing. The 
language was archaic and at 
times incomprehensible. The play 
opened with a scene supposedly 
set in a schoolyard. However, 
as the actors played catch with 
a rubber ball, their antiquated 
dialogue was a harsh contrast to 
their childish demeanors. The 
overly complex and philosophical 
language continued to detract 
from the powerful story. The play 
was also two hours of non-stop 
darkly heavy content. While the 
ideas may be timeless, the show 
was too serious to sit through 

without any comedic relief, or, 
for that matter, an intermission.
Even with this controversial 
and slightly problematic script, 
the direction could have been 
what saved the show, but I did 
not find this to be the case. When 
delivering their lines, most of 
the actors employed the same 
strange mix of teen angst through 
a somewhat Shakespearian tone.
Even more unsettling was 
that, for the majority of the 
play, every line seemed to be 
screamed. For yelling to be at 
all effective, it needs to happen 
rarely. However, I found it 
hard to care more about a main 
character’s speech preceding his 
death than his woes regarding 
his class rank because both were 
delivered in the same tone and 
volume. Given the consistency 
in screaming across characters, 
it seems more plausible that this 
was a directing issue rather than 
a personal choice coincidentally 
made by almost the entire cast of 
drama students.
For a show that deals so 
heavily with female adolescence 
and female sexuality, I was 
surprised to learn that both 
directors were male. It was 
definitely interesting to watch 
the actors, both male and female, 
work 
through 
this 
material 
knowing it was both written 
and directed by men. While it’s 
admirable that these students 
desired to shed light on female 
issues, watching this raised the 
question of why we continue to 
perform and celebrate stories 
written about women by men, 
instead of bringing the opinions 
and 
perspectives 
of 
women 
themselves forward.
Despite 
the 
questionable 
directing, it was clear that 
the actors were well-trained 
drama 
students. 
Particularly 
successful was SMTD junior 
Emma 
Steiner 
as 
Wendla 
Bergmann. Steiner carefully and 
maturely executed the innocence 

and 
sincerity 
necessary 
for 
Wendla. She had clear intention 
behind her actions, as well as 
an understanding of both the 
language and the objectives of 
her character. Consequently, her 
scenes were some of the most 
enjoyable, as she was able to 
more explicitly convey the plot 
points and underlying emotions. 
SMTD junior Nathan Correll as 
Hansy/Mrs. Gabor also stood 
out because of the contrast in his 
portrayals of the overbearing, 
ultimately 
sympathetic 
Mrs. 
Gabor and the closeted gay 
schoolboy, Hansy. He was able 
to reach the audience because of 
the variation both between and 
within each of his performances, 
and he was exceptionally precise 
in his emotional delivery of each 
of his monologues.
Most importantly, audiences 
might be tired of shows that 
merely present how bad things 
were (or are). It’s harmful to 
present themes of homophobia, 
sexism, suicide and rape to 
audiences if there is no new or 
insightful take on them. We know 
that things used to be and still are 
bad, and a lot of times this stems 
from deep-rooted societal issues. 
But what next? There needs to be 
an adequate justification to show 
these deeply personal topics in 
such a blunt and graphic way, 
and this play did not deliver this. 
Furthermore, to present these 
heavy and extremely relevant 
topics so inaccessibly borders on 
irresponsible.
In the end, the content and 
delivery left me wondering why 
Basement Arts chose this play. 
The reason why the 2006 musical 
adaptation was so successful 
was because it took a heavy yet 
important story and presented 
it appropriately for 21st century 
audiences. This return to the 
original play fell flat because 
neither the presentation nor the 
source material are relevant to 
modern viewers.

‘Spring Awakening’ can’t 
reach modern audiences

Breaking down the Wolverines’ recent revival

Two days before the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
thrashing of Indiana, Eli Brooks 
leaned against the blue curtains 
of the Crisler Center media room, 
his blue mesh practice pinnie 
almost blending in.
The 
junior 
guard 
fielded 
questions, most of which had 
nothing to do with the Hoosiers. 
Instead, he was asked to discuss 
the Wolverines’ recent revival.
A conversation like Friday’s 
seemed unthinkable less than 
three weeks ago, when senior 
point guard Zavier Simpson was 
suspended for the Wolverines’ 
trip to Lincoln in the midst of the 
program’s longest losing streak 
in five years. With junior forward 
Isaiah Livers already unavailable 
due to a groin injury, a loss to 
lowly Nebraska could’ve put the 
nail in Michigan’s coffin.
That night, however, marked 
an inflection point. And since 
losing four straight Big Ten 
games from Jan. 12-26, the 
Wolverines have won five of their 
last six, evening their conference 
record in the process.
“It feels like the Bahamas 
again,” Brooks said Friday.
The most telling part? He 
wasn’t even going out on a limb.
Paradise Island, of course, 
was where Michigan first put 
itself in the early national-title 
conversation. The Wolverines 
rolled to a pair of top-10 wins 
in a hotel ballroom during 
Thanksgiving week, punctuating 
the first month of the Juwan 
Howard era with a No. 4 national 
ranking.
And after limping to a 3-8 
record 
against 
high-major 
opponents in December and 
January, 
the 
Michigan 
of 
February is playing the same 
brand of basketball it did in 
November. In the last 10 days 
alone, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
knocked off Michigan State and 
cruised to blowout wins against 
Northwestern and Indiana.

“It feels like we’re back to the 
beginning of the year a little bit,” 
sophomore 
forward 
Brandon 
Johns Jr. said Sunday. “We’re 
all so connected, trusting each 
other, knocking down shots. … 
We’re having more team bonding 
sessions. We’re getting to know 
each other more, understanding 
each 
other 
as 
well.”
Added Brooks: 
“People 
are 
having fun and 
you can see the 
smiles. 
Before 
the Northwestern 
game, something 
coach 
Howard 
preached 
was, 
‘Go 
out 
there 
and have fun.’ I 
feel like sometimes you get lost 
that it’s a basketball game. We 
lose that sometimes, just having 
smiles on everyone’s faces.”
Winning 
helps, 
especially 
when it’s against an in-state 
rival or by margins of 20-plus 
over teams at the bottom of the 
conference standings. This elite 
level of winning, however, is 
comparable to the Wolverines’ 
victories over Gonzaga and North 

Carolina in the Bahamas. Albeit a 
small sample size, Michigan has 
been the best team in the nation 
over its last five games, according 
to Bart Torvik’s power rating.
Though he suffered an ankle 
injury on Sunday — a “tweak,” 
according to Johns — Livers’s 
return from injury has improved 
the Wolverines’ 
3-point 
shooting, 
defense 
and 
confidence. 
Most 
importantly, 
though, 
one 
of 
their 
most 
impactful 
leaders is now 
more than just 
a voice coming 
from the bench.
But above all, Howard is 
beginning to come into his own 
as a coach. His hiring marked a 
storied icon’s return to Crisler 
Center, though he had no head 
coaching experience prior to this 
season outside of the low-stakes 
NBA Summer League.
Even as the successor to 
one of the finest minds in 
college 
basketball, 
Howard’s 

NBA-style 
philosophies 
were 
unsurprisingly new to a team full 
of athletes recruited to play a role 
in previous coach John Beilein’s 
system.
“Some of our players probably 
never played in a defensive 
scheme like what I taught, what 
I brought to the program,” 
Howard said Sunday. “They 
bought in, for sure, but it takes 
time and development. It’s not 
always going to click right away. 
The beauty of it is they trusted 
and 
continued 
building 
the 
habits and getting better with it.
“… We’re getting better as the 
season goes. I didn’t expect for us 
to have a great start like we did, 
but it was beautiful to get off to 
a good start. But it takes time for 
a group to learn a new system on 
the defensive end as well as the 
offensive end.”
It took losing, it took slumps 
and, most of all, it took time. But 
now, spurred by the return of 
Livers, it most certainly appears 
the Wolverines are beyond their 
learning curve.
And because of it, a season 
that once seemed earmarked for 
a disappointing finish now has a 
new life.

Cameron Weston’s roller-coaster weekend

It’s hard to imagine a series 
of events more challenging for a 
freshman pitcher making his debut 
than that which befell Cameron 
Weston last Friday night.
On a macroscopic level, a neck-
and-neck rerun of the 2019 College 
World Series provided high stakes; 
even so, Weston’s circumstance 
of usage borders on cruel and 
unusual. 
The 
right-hander 
emerged 
from the bullpen in the bottom of 
the seventh to relieve junior right-
hander Jeff Criswell, who’d held 
then-No. 1 Vanderbilt to two hits in 
six and one-third innings of work. 
Weston took the mound with one 
out and two inherited runners. 
Against his first hitter, Weston 
did what the rest of the pitching 
staff was quite happy to do: pitch to 
contact and induce a ground ball.
“We have an amazing defense,” 
redshirt 
freshman 
left-hander 
Steve Hajjar said. “Especially 
(junior shortstop Jack) Blomgren 
and (freshman third baseman 
Ted) Burton on the left side, and 
(redshirt senior Matt) Schmidt 
and (sophomore second baseman 
Riley) Bertram on the right side. 
Those guys are absolute brick walls 
behind me.”
But in that moment, a hole 

in the wall appeared. Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich elected not 
to shift against the left-handed 
pinch hitter Patrick Noland, and 
a grounder to the right side that 
could have originated an inning-
ending double play turned into 
a run-scoring single. The game 
was tied: Weston had blown the 
hold and Criswell could no longer 
receive credit for the win. 
“I thought our pitching was 
pretty good,” Bakich said. “(The 
weakness) 
was 
more 
in 
the 
department of allowing batted 
runners to get to second base, 
allowing guys to take the extra 
base.”
After coming up empty against 
his first career batter, Weston had 
to face Harrison Ray with runners 
at the corners. Ray belied his 
bottom-of-the-order 
assignment 
by using a 1-1 offspeed offering to 
lay down a safety squeeze bunt.
The ball trickled down the first-
base line, forcing Weston to make 
his first defensive play. By the time 
he’d picked up the ball, Ray was 
streaking by.
Weston had two options: throw 
home, where a tag would be 
needed, or turn around and throw 
to first, trading a run for an out. He 
chose the former, but the go-ahead 
run arrived ahead of the throw. 
A fresh set of runners stood on 
the corners, the top of the order 

was due up and there was still just 
one out. Bakich brought in redshirt 
senior left-hander Ben Keizer, 
who retired the remainder of the 
side. Keizer ended up tallying one 
and two-third scoreless innings 
and took home the win thanks to 
Schmidt’s go-ahead homer in the 
ninth.
“It was a team win for us,” 
Criswell said. “We battled. It was 
a back and forth game … It kind of 
had that post season baseball feel.”
Despite 
Weston’s 
struggles 
against 
Vanderbilt, 
Bakich 
remained confident in his young 
reliever — confident enough to call 
upon him in another high-leverage 
situation.
When 
Cal 
Poly 
made 
a 
comeback in the bottom of the 

ninth the following day, scoring 
two runs and loading the bases, 
it was Weston’s time again. With 
the winning run at bat, he induced 
a ground ball out on the second 
pitch, earning redemption and his 
first save.
“There were so many different 
breakout candidates that could 
be on the horizon,” Bakich said. 
“Just guys that had their moments 
in different games that could be 
positive contributors for the entire 
season.”
Bakich only knows of Weston’s 
in-game ability because he took 
two chances on the unproven 
freshman. Thanks to the risk, both 
know of the latter’s ability to record 
collegiate outs in the toughest of 
spots.

T

he Michigan women’s 
basketball team is no 
stranger to adversity, 
especially when it comes to inju-
ries. 
First, 
senior for-
ward Kayla 
Robbins 
tore her 
ACL Jan. 
19. Then 
her replace-
ment, 
sophomore 
guard Dan-
ielle Rauch, 
injured her hand before the 
Feb. 6 game against Purdue. 
For a Wolverines team that 
started the season with only 
11 players on the roster, los-
ing a starter and sixth player 
spelled doom. 
Then came the apocalypse. 
In the first quarter of 
Thursday’s game against No. 
19 Northwestern, where a win 
would have put Michigan in 
excellent position to make the 
NCAA Tournament, sopho-
more forward Naz Hillmon 
stayed down after diving for a 
loose ball and colliding with a 
Wildcat defender. 
A silent Crisler Center 
crowd held its breath as the 
Wolverines’ leading scorer 
walked to the bench, visibly 
experiencing pain near her 
right shoulder. With Hillmon 
limited to just 15 minutes, 
Michigan fell, 66-60. 
Still, things could have 
gone much worse. Strong per-
formances from senior guard 
Akienreh Johnson, sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk and junior 
forward Hailey Brown meant 
the Wolverines could hang 
tough until the end, despite 
sustaining a few more bumps 
and bruises throughout the 
game. 
“I could see their fight. 
They were fighting like 
crazy,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “(Johnson) 
was all over the place and 
selling out. On that last pos-
session before (Johnson) went 
down, Amy stood in there and 
took a charge, we didn’t get 
that call. You could see the 
way that they were fighting 
for each other and that’s what 
we ask for them.”
That fight disappeared at 
the Rutgers Athletic Center 
Sunday, where Michigan 
played its worst game all 
season in a 62-41 loss. The 
offense looked frozen from 
start to finish. Passes flew out 
of bounds. Nearly every shot 

either hit the rim or the out-
stretched hand of a Rutgers 
defender. Hillmon played, but 
she clearly wasn’t 100 percent, 
tallying just five points. As 
a result, the Wolverines had 
just as many turnovers (15) as 
made field goals.
This bout of adversity felt 
nothing like what happened 
earlier in the season. In the 
first two games after Rauch’s 
injury, Michigan squeaked 
by Purdue at home before 
beating Minnesota by 25 on 
the road. Both were quality 
opponents, too — like the Wol-
verines, they were still jock-
eying for spots in the NCAA 
Tournament. Michigan took 
an impossible situation and 
somehow kept playing just as 
well as it had before. 
After those two games, the 
Wolverines looked unstop-
pable. Throughout the season, 
it had faced what felt like an 
unbreakable spell of adversity 
— from turnover problems, to 
bad losses, to heartbreaking 
injuries — and still competed 
with some of the Big Ten’s 
top teams. Even after Thurs-
day’s loss to Northwestern, it 
looked like they weren’t com-
pletely dead in the water. 
“I just think it’s the culture 
that’s been created in our pro-
gram,” Barnes Arico said after 
that game. “Our kids have 
been really doing a great job 
of staying positive and trying 
to rally around the injured 
kids.”
Michigan’s season isn’t 
over. We don’t know much 
about the seriousness of 
Hillmon’s injury, and Barnes 
Arico doesn’t have a time-
frame for when she’ll be back 
to 100 percent. Maybe she’ll 
be back at full strength on 
Wednesday and hang 25 on 
Illinois. Maybe she’ll go to 
East Lansing on Sunday hun-
grier than ever and bury the 
Wolverines’ rival for the sec-
ond time this year. 
But Sunday, Michigan 
finally found a problem that 
culture can’t fix. Make no 
mistake, its ability to respond 
to adversity this season has 
been nothing short of tremen-
dous. Very few teams start the 
season with just 11 players on 
the roster. Even fewer would 
be able to compete after losing 
two key players to injury. 
None would be able to win 
after losing a Naz Hillmon.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Junior guard Eli Brooks said that Michigan’s recent run of five wins in six games, “feels like the Bahamas again.”

It feels like 
we’re back to 
the beginning 
of the year.

Over undefeated opening weekends, Michigan demonstrates consistency

Carol Hutchins could teach a 
class on one-pitch softball. And, in 
fact, she did. 
Over the offseason, Hutchins 
and the Michigan softball team 
read the book “Heads-Up Baseball” 
and met weekly to discuss their 
takeaways. It’s about a mentality — 
focusing on taking the game one bat 
at a time to achieve consistency at 
the plate.
And, if the past two weekends are 
any indication, the Wolverines took 
a lot away from those sessions. The 
team is starting off the season with 
a 9-0 record, including three wins 
against ranked opponents: one over 

No. 7 Florida and two against No. 
25 North Carolina. And Michigan 
hasn’t been squeaking by — six of 
its nine games have been won by a 
margin of four or more, including a 
six-inning run rule over the Gators. 
This early road success is a far cry 
from how the Wolverines started 
last season. After the first two 
weekends, Michigan limped home 
with a 4-5 record, having fallen to 
teams it trounced a year later due 
to a lack of offensive consistency. 
The Wolverines would end a game 
scoreless in the morning just to 
come back later that day and pull 
out 10 runs. 
Even within games, they would 
hit a hot streak — scoring four or 
five runs in an inning — then lay 

dormant for the remainder.
But, in 2020, consistency is the 
name of the game for Michigan. 
Not only have the Wolverines 
managed to keep their bats hot 
from game to game but also from 
one inning to the next.
“We are doing a really good job 
of not going with the roller coaster 
of ups and downs whether we have 
good innings offensively, a bad 
inning offensively,” Hutchins said. 
“Whether the other team has a 
good inning, we really just stay on 
task. We’ve been very good at the 
one-pitch softball and I think it’s 
our strength.”
In their second game of the 
season, the Wolverines got on the 
board early and kept the momentum 

going, scoring in each of the second, 
third and fifth innings en route to a 
win. The weekend against the Tar 
Heels, they did it again, scoring 
in the second inning and slowly 
increasing their lead over the next 
three innings with one run each 
inning. 
This comes from being able 
to rely on production from all 
parts of the lineup. Last year, the 
Wolverines’ RBI came mostly from 
the top of the order, anchored by 
then-freshman 
outfielder 
Lexie 
Blair, and seniors Natalie Peters and 
Faith Canfield. 
Now, Michigan is firing on all 
cylinders with big hits coming from 
the center of the lineup, highlighted 
by junior infielder Lou Allan, 

sophomore 
outfielder 
Morgan 
Overaitis and senior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad. 
But the Wolverines are far from 
perfect. During opening weekend, 
they 
played 
two 
consecutive 
games in which they edged out 
their opponent by a single run. The 
contest against unranked Fresno 
State went into extra innings 
scoreless. With matchups against 
powerhouses like No. 1 Washington 
and No. 6 Texas on the horizon, one 
or two runs isn’t going to cut it. 
“The most important thing I 
think our team manages is just kind 
of staying within ourselves, not 
making the highs get too high and 
the lows get too low — just kind of 
keep it a common ground between 

the two,” Blair said. “And I think 
we’ve just done a really good job as 
a team of working on that and being 
cognizant of that.”
And it’s still early. The offense 
Michigan brought to Florida in last 
year’s opening weekend wasn’t the 
same offense that showed up to — 
and won — the Big Ten Tournament 
in May. Through the rest of their 
away tournaments and conference 
play, there’s time for the Wolverines 
to change — for better or for worse. 
Nine games is a small sample 
size. Michigan’s offense could stall 
under the wear and tear of constant 
travel. Or it could keep applying 
the consistency it learned in the 
classroom, and that could make all 
the difference.

Wolverines win Duel in the D, 4-1

DETROIT — Nick Blankenburg 
extended his two hands out and 
wagged them up and down like 
paws. At first glance, it seemed 
like an innocent gesture. His 
teammates even imitated him 
as they wrapped him in hugs of 
celebration.
But the message from his 
mouth matched the motion of his 
arms in a more crude way.
“Sit 
down,” 
he 
told 
the 
Michigan State portion of the 
crowd at Little 
Caesars Arena.
The 
only 
problem 
was 
he 
and 
the 
Michigan hockey 
team gave the 
audience 
little 
reason 
to 
sit 
quietly in their 
seats in a 4-1 win 
over 
Michigan 
State on Monday 
night.
Blankenburg had just scored 
a goal, the third of the night for 
the Wolverines, in a highlight-
reel fashion. In the second period, 
Michigan drew a power play, and 
after an unsuccessful first shift, 
switched to their primary unit. 
Blankenburg got the puck at the 
blue line and slung a bullet high. 
And the top-shelf snipe rang off 
the post and into the net. 
Only a few stayed in their 
seats.
“We had timely scoring,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “I give Michigan State a lot 
of credit. … They’re a tough team 
to play against when you get 
behind them. We were fortunate, 
again, to play with the lead.”
The Wolverines had built 
that 
lead 
much 
earlier 
in 
the game, going back to five 
minutes into the first period. 
Lockwood corralled the puck in 
the defensive and pushed down 
central ice. The line out on the 

ice was desperate for a change, 
but that’s not what Lockwood 
had in mind.
There were two Spartans in 
front of him — one to the left and 
one to his right. 
He beat both of them to the 
slot. He snapped his wrist, 
looking only at the net.
A strong start was what 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson had 
wished for before the game, and 
as it was, his wish was granted: 
Lockwood scored on his one-
man breakaway into traffic. 
Graduate transfer forward Jacob 
Hayhurst added 
to 
the 
early 
scoring with a 
power play goal 
from Lockwood 
and Slaker later 
in the first.
The 
start 
wasn’t 
without 
its 
caveats, 
however. 
A 
minute 
after 
Lockwood’s 
opening 
goal, 
the 
Spartans 
answered with a two-on-one 
rush.
Senior 
defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 
was 
conducting 
the 
transition defense, but as he 
started to commit to the puck 
handler, Spartan Adam Goodsir, 
he failed to notice Goodsir’s pass 
to the open man, Dennis Cesana. 
Sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann had also committed on 
Goodsir and was unable to do 
anything to stop Cesana’s open-
net shot.
It was the only mistake of 
the night for Mann, though the 
second period gave him plenty of 
chances to make another. 
Michigan State had a game-
high 13 shots in the second and 
there were plenty of saves to be 
made, of all difficulties. Two 
point-blank shots in the crease 
forced Mann to make high-
degree saves. Minutes later, the 
Spartans had a Grade-A open 
shot, but Mann stuck out his stick 

at the last second to deflect it. 
The puck bounced off his helmet, 
and teetered the goal line before 
freshman forward Nolan Moyle 
cleared it.
“I don’t know how it stayed 
out, honestly,” Lockwood said. 
“He does that at practice day in 
and day out, so we’re kind of used 
to it at this point. But you see it live 
like that, it’s pretty spectacular.”
Mann 
had 
played 
what 
Pearson had called his best game 
of the second half of the season. 
But as stout as Michigan was 
defensively, it was equally so on 
offense. And they hammered 
that point home in the third 
period.
A minute into the frame, Luce 
stopped the puck at the point and 
shot. It was unclear if Lockwood 
was there willingly, to screen 
or to try and top the shot, but he 
did both anyways. He held the 
flat of his stick to face the twine, 
and as the puck reached his stick, 
the shot was redirected. The 
puck slowly slipped between the 
goaltender’s blockers and to the 
back of the net.
Lockwood 
skated 
to 
the 
side. He had already raised his 
stick with one hand, but with 
the other, he swung upwards, 
motioning for all to rise. But 
there was no need. Everyone was 
already up.

‘M’ goes 2-for-2 on power play in win

DETROIT — Dennis Cesana 
didn’t have an answer for the 
two power play goals his team 
allowed.
“I’m not sure they changed 
anything up too much,” the 
Michigan State defender said 
about the Wolverines’ power 
play. 
But Cesana was wrong. 
All week long in practice, 
Michigan ran power play drills 
and made adjustments as it saw 
fit. It moved players around to 
different positions with hopes 
of throwing off the Spartan 
penalty killers. Monday night, 
the Wolverines did just that on 
their way to a 4-1 win.
“I don’t think they really 
had a game plan for some of the 
things we were doing,” senior 
forward Will Lockwood said.
Michigan scored two power 
play goals — good for a 100 
percent conversion rate. Both 
came at pivotal moments in the 
game. The first gave Michigan 
the lead, the second separation. 
The 
first 
power 
play 
opportunity came with just 
under five minutes remaining 
in the first period and the 
Wolverines wasted no time in 
capitalizing. 

Senior forward Jake Slaker 
and Lockwood connected on a 
pass in between two Michigan 
State defensemen. Lockwood 
was in the right faceoff circle, 
all alone. He stick-handled 
twice before throwing a pass 
to graduate transfer forward 
Jacob Hayhurst.
Hayhurst turned his hips 
toward the goal when he saw 
the puck coming his way, 
positioning 
himself 
directly 
in front of Spartan goaltender 
John Lethemon. With a quick 
flick of his wrist, he beat 
Lethemon and 
broke the 1-1 
tie.
“The power 
play was good 
tonight,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
said. 
“Scoring 
the 
power 
play 
goal was big 
because 
they 
came right back. You know, 
we scored, they come back to 
make it 1-1. To get that next one 
again. To play with the lead is 
important, especially against 
good teams like this.”
While Hayhurst’s goal ended 
up being the game-winner, 
the Wolverines’ power play 
units weren’t satisfied yet. 
Ninety 
seconds 
into 
the 
second period, Michigan was 
presented with another man 
advantage opportunity.
This 
time, 
the 
goal 
came 
from 
the 
stick 
of 
sophomore defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg. At the blueline 
of his team’s offensive zone, 
freshman defenseman Cam 
York 
passed 
the 
puck 
to 
Blankenburg. With his head 
looking to the goal, he assessed 
his options. Lockwood and 
Slaker were drifting near the 
net, but rather than finding 
one of them, he passed back to 
York.

York took advantage of the 
few feet of open ice in front of 
him, drawing two Michigan 
State defenders to him. This 
movement freed up Blankenburg, 
still positioned at the blueline. 
When he received the second pass 
from York, he’d already made up 
his mind — he was shooting.
A second later the puck blew 
past Lethemon.
The Wolverines now had a 
two-goal lead, and it was all due 
to their special team’s success.
“The 
puck 
movement, 
I 
thought we moved it really 
well,” Lockwood 
said. “We did all 
practice this past 
week. So leading 
into 
these 
two 
games we were 
expecting 
to 
succeed, 
and 
I think we did 
well.”
After 
Friday, 
Michigan’s 
power 
play 
conversion sat at 17.8 percent. 
It’s not great, or even good. 
It’s average. But it’s strides 
ahead of where it was a few 
months ago. In a November 
series against Minnesota, the 
Wolverines went 0-for-9 on the 
man advantage. The success 
rate sat at just 17.6 percent.
But in this series against 
Michigan 
State, 
the 
power 
play found its footing. The 
adjustments Michigan made 
— which Pearson declined to go 
into specifics about — clearly 
worked. In Friday night’s game 
against the Spartans, the power 
play went 1-for-5, and Monday 
night it was perfect, going 2-for-
2. 
The Wolverines are becoming 
serious contenders for the Big 
Ten regular season title — 
something that a few months 
ago seemed out of the question. 
Building on their power play 
success is a key to getting 
there.
