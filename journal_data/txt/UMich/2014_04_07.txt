CSG Commission
holds inclusive
event that provides
prom experience
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
About 40 University students
had a second chance to create
prom night memories at the fire-
and-ice-themed Pride Prom in
the Michigan League Saturday
night.
The LGBT Issues Commission
of Central Student Government
sponsored the Pride Prom to proL
vide students the opportunity
to express themselves in a fun
social setting. The Commission
works to improve and promote
LGBTQ student life and pride
throughout the year.
LSA junior Robert Schwar-
zhaupt, the Commission's chair,
said the event is valuable because
many LGBTQ individuals don't
have the chance to experience

prom or dances during in high
school.
"We really wanted to bring
back that tradition and give peo-
ple the space to experience that
prom-cliche kind of dance," he
said.
Although the Commission
was unable to hold a prom last
year, there have been other pride
proms at the University in the
past hosted by other groups.
LSA senior Katarina Evans
said she went to Pride Prom a few
years ago in East Quad, but noted
that this year's prom included
more of the campus community
since it was held in the League.
Many students attended this
year's prom wearing dresses and
bow ties. While students danced
in the center of the room, prom-
goers could also take pictures in
a photo booth.
Music, Theatre & Dance
sophomore Kalia Medeiros, who
attended the event, said it met all
her expectations.
"There's a photo booth, danc-
ing, camaraderie and food,"

That Brown Show
blends diverse
genres, disciplines
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
Saturday, a blur of vibrant
costumes, dynamic music and
harmonious voices filled the
Power Center for the fourth

annual performance of That
Brown Show.
Students performed tradi-
tional and contemporary South
Asian music and dance to a
crowd of over 300 friends, fam-
ily and members of the Ann
Arbor community.
That Brown Show was start-
ed in 2011 by Michigan Sahana,
a group of Indian classical danc-
ers and musicians, as a way to
unite the different South Asian

performing groups on campus
and give them the opportunity
to showcase their talents. The
show also hopes to educate the
University and Ann Arbor com-
munity on South Asian arts.
Engineering sophomore
Shwetha Hariharan, dance
chair of That Brown Show for
Michigan Sahana, said the group
reaches out to South Asian per-
forming groups all over campus
in order to recruit teams for the

show.
"We try to make it as inclusive
as possible, and most years we're
able to get most of the teams to
perform," she said. "Sometimes
they'll have competitions or
other things going on, but we
really want to make an inclu-
sive experience and allow all the
teams to come together because
it is one of the purposes of the
show."

Gathering reaches
8,000 amid debate
over pot legalization
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Ah, spring is in the air ... As
was something else on Satur-
day.

This year's Hash Bash, an
annual celebration of all things
hemp and marijuana, took place
on the Diag and Monroe Street.
Around 8,000 people attended
this year's event, a significant
increase over other recent bash-
es.
The number of attendees at
Hash Bash has increased every
year since the use of medi-
cal marijuana was legalized in

2009. In 2010 and 2011, nearly
5,000 and 6,000 were in atten-
dance, respectively.
Since 1972, individuals in
possession of marijuana in Ann
Arbor have only been charged
with a small civil-infraction
fine. But according to Charmie

'U' hospital director resigns

40 years ago (April 12,1974)
University Hospital Direc-
tor Edward Connors resigned
following an audit of his travel
expenses, which revealed misuse
of expense account funds.
The funds were considered
misused because Connors had
allegedly charged the expenses
twice - once to the University
and again to outside organiza-
tions.
A. B. Hicks, director of Univer-
sity Audits, refused to comment
on the case beyond telling The
Michigan Daily that he'd rath-
er not explain the University's
auditing policy at that time.
In a written statement, Con-
nors said his actions represented

a serious mistake in judgment,
and that he planned to fully repay
the University once the exact
total of misused funds was deter-
mined.
30years ago (April 10, 1984)
A series of arson incidents in
South Quad continued, marking
the fifth fire in less than a month.
Resident Adviser Eve Skirboll
told her residents at a special
house meeting that they need to
start moving faster in response,
even if they think it isn't serious.
"I'm one of the last ones out
of this building and I don't want
to burn," Skirboll said. "So when
that fire alarm sounds I want you
moving."

10years ago (April 8,2004)
A large number of graduate
student instructors cancelled
their classes in solidarity with
protesting members of the Lec-
turers' Employees Organization.
LEO's protest was focused on
certain demands they wanted the
University to meet during their
ongoing contract negotiations,
such as a revision of their health
benefits package and measures to
increase job security.
GSI Leanne Powner, who can-
celled her office hours, said she
supported the strike because the
issues LEO members were fac-
ing could affect her in the near
future.

Arab-American
leaders support
church invitation
to Easter egg hunt
Arab-American and Muslim
leaders are defending a subur-
ban-Detroit church that drew
criticism for inviting children at
public schools with many Mus-
lim children to attend its Easter
egg hunt.
Invitations to the upcoming
Saturday's Eggstravaganza at
Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church
were distributed last week in
elementary schools in Dearborn.
The Detroit suburb is the center
of southeastern Michigan's large
Arab-American community and
has a high proportion of Muslim
children.
Lawyer Majed Mougni tells
the Detroit Free Press his two
young children were upset to get
fliers about the event.
The Rev. Netta Nichols says
it's intended for children of any
religion and isn't an attempt to
proselytize.

Mormon leader
restates opposition
to gay marraige
A top Mormon leader reiter-
ated the church's opposition to
gay marriage Saturday during
the church's biannual general
conference.
The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints' stance on
homosexuality has softened in
recent years, but this marks the
second consecutive conference
in which leaders took time to
emphasize the faith's insistence
that marriage should be limited
to unions between a man and a
woman, as God created.
"While many governments
and well-meaning individu-
als have redefined marriage,
the Lord has not," said Neil L.
Andersen of the Quorum of the

Twelve. "He designated the
purpose of marriage to go far
beyond the personal satisfaction
and fulfillment of adults, to more
importantly, advancing the ideal
setting for children to be born,
reared and nurtured."

to tour China's new

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck

tour Monday of China's first air-
craft carrier, becoming the first
foreign visitor to go aboard the
ship.
A senior defense official
said Hagel requested the visit,
which comes a day after he told
reporters that China must better
respect its neighbors - a pointed
allusion to Beijing's ongoing ter-
ritorial dispute with Japan and
others over remote islands in the
East China Sea. He also has con-
tinued to urge Beijing to be more
transparent about its expanding

This year's show included
performances by 58 Greene,
Michigan Sahana, Maya, TAAL,
Michigan Manzil, The Michi-
gan Raas, Maize Mirchi and
The Michigan Bhangra Team,
said Engineering senior Hema
Karunakaram, the show's chair.
Each group's piece was preceded
by a short video clip to introduce
its members, convey the purpose
of the team and set the stage for
the performance.
Groups such as Michigan
Sahana and Maya performed
Indian classical dance while
TAAL and Michigan Manzil
performed Bollywood-style
dances. Raas presented a tradi-
tional folk dance while the Mich-
igan Bhangra Team performed a
blend of styles.
Groups such as 58 Greene,
Michigan Sahana and Maize
Mirchi gave vocal performanc-
es. 58 Greene opened the show
with an a cappella version of
the national anthem, followed
by Michigan Sahana's rendition
of the Indian national anthem.

Michigan Sahana musicians also
performed traditional Indian
Engineering junior Abbhinav
Muralidharan,the show's music
chair, said the performance is
unique because of the diversity
of the acts it offers.
"You wouldn't find this set
of performing teams together
in any other show because they
have different styles of dance,
different styles of music but they
all perform together for one
show," Muralidharan said.
Engineering sophomore Jacob
Gersh said he was impressed by
how a shared culture brought the
groups, who come from multiple
artistic genres, together.
"They're not connected by the
thing they do, they're connected
by the heritage they share and
from that they build a perfor-
mance," Gersh said.
Hariharan said the name of
the show comes from the shared
backgrounds of the performers.
"Brown is the common factor in
all these teams," Hariharan said.
"We're all reallydifferent ...butthe
thing that ties us together is that
we're all South Asian and we all
like to refer to ourselves as brown.
It'sjustsomethingreallycasual."

HASHBASH

legalization remains relevant.
"The direction that this rally
has taken is dramatic," Gholson
said. "It's always been a smoke-
in, it's always been a rally of the
people, by the people and for
the people. At this point, we're
no longer strictly on the menu
regarding our lives and how our

legislation impacts it. We're at
the table. We have our place at
the table."
Though the city of Ann Arbor
has some of the most lenient
penalties for individuals caught
in possession of marijuana, the
University Police adhere to
state laws, even during Hash
Bash.
But interactions were gener-
ally civil on Saturday. Univer-
sity Police made only one arrest
while attendees enjoyed vendors

and live music.
This year's Hash Bash, now
in its 43rd year, is not the same
event it was in 1972. Activists
are fighting the same cause with
different tools.
"The Internet has democra-
tized the media for us and given
us tools with which to orga-
nize," Gholson said. "It's an
absolute flood of change right
now. There's no stopping it.
Legalization is a forgone con-
clusion."

Rick Thompson, a contributor
to pro-marijuana publications
like The American Cultivator,
The Burn Magazine and The
Compassion Chronicles, encour-
aged attendees to take pictures
with their phones and post the
pictures on social media plat-
forms.
"We're all going to take pho-
tos of what's going on at Hash
Bash - are you ready?" he asked
the crowd. "But that's only part
one. Now we Facebook those

photos."
Law student Reid Murdoch,
executive director of Law Stu-
dents for Sensible Drug Policy,
collected signatures for state
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor)
and 2016 cannabis legalization
efforts.
"It's a beautiful event," Mur-
doch said. "It's the longest-run-
ning drug policy event in the
country. I'm just really honored
to be a part of it. It's a cultural
tradition."


PUPPIES

FirstBook - an organizationthat
provides children in low-income
areaswith age appropriate books
to foster alove of reading.
"We're hoping to raise aware-
ness for literacy which is Pi Phi's
philanthropy," said LSA sopho-
more Leah Sobel, Pi Beta Phi
philanthropy chair. "It's not nec-
essarily as well-known as breast
cancer or something, but if kids
can't read by third grade, they're
probably never going to read,
and we want to raise awareness
because you wouldn'tnecessarily
know that without doing a lot of
research."
LSA junior Nick Reed, Sigma
Chiphilanthropychair, saidPup-
pies on the Porch is an important
transition year and something
that the two Greek institutions
look forward to collaborating
on each year. This year's event
raised approximately $6,000.
"We've beengiving our money
to the animal shelter every year
and we think it's a great cause,"
Reed said. "It's nice for people to
get to play with the puppies and
they love being played with too,
so really it's a win-win for every-
one."
Around 400 tickets were pre-
sold for the event. Reed said
while the event was advertised
through social media channels,
word-of-mouth is the biggest
draw for the event.
"I love this fundraiser because
it sells itself; everyone loves play-
ing with puppies, and especially
when we have them out on the
front lawn and everyone's having

fun, it's like the best marketing
ever," Reed added.
LSA sophomore Nathan
Novaria said he wanted to sup-
port the organizations efforts
because he also believes that phi-
lanthropy is an important part of
Greek Life.
"I'm the philanthropy chair
of Beta Theta Pi, so I try to go to
as many events as possible just
to show my support, because
it's such an important aspect
of what we do," Novaria said.
"Obviously community service
is really important around Ann
Arbor, but it's also important
to look at larger foundations
across the nation and sustain-
ing them so they can continue
to give back beyond our Ann
Arbor bubble."
Novaria added that the pres-
ence of puppies was also a major
factor in his decision to attend,
specifically because the weather
was so dreary.
"Ithinkit'sareallysmartmove
bringing in puppies because who
doesn't love puppies?" he said.
"It's great that they're able to do
this because it's a nice break for
students and they can come and
play with a puppy, while contrib-
uting to a great cause. I think it
generates a lot of their interest
aside from the fact that they're
both great organizations."
LSA freshman Leslie Alter
echoed Novaria's sentiments,
saying that she enjoyed the
interactive aspect of the event,
as opposed to simply donating
money to a cause.
She added that she was think-
ing about "stealing" one of the
small golden retriever puppies
because it was her favorite from
the day.

US sending two warships to Japan
to counter North Korean threat

Defense Secretary
says there is a lack
of respect in China
TOKYO (AP) - U.S. Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel deliv-
ered a two-pronged warning
to Asia Pacific nations Sunday,
announcing that the U.S. will
send two additional ballistic
missile destroyers to Japan
to counter the North Korean
threat, and saying China must
better respect its neighbors.
In unusually forceful
remarks about China, Hagel
drew a direct line between
Russia's takeover of Ukraine's
Crimea region and the ongoing
territorial disputes between
China, Japan and others over
remote islands in the East
China Sea.
"I think we're seeing some
clear evidence of a lack of
respect and intimidation and
coercion in Europe today with
what the Russians have done
with Ukraine," Hagel told

reporters after a meeting with
Japanese Defense Minister
Itsunori Onodera. "We must
be very careful and we must
be very clear, all nations of the
world, that in the 21st century
this will not stand, you cannot
go around the world and rede-
fine boundaries and violate
territorial integrity and sov-
ereignty of nations by force,
coercion and intimidation
whether it's in small islands in
the Pacific or large nations in
Europe."
Hagel, who will travel to
China later this week, called
the Asian nation a "great
power," and added, "with this
power comes new and wider
responsibilities as to how'
you use that power, how you
employ that military power."
He said he will talk to the
Chinese about having respect
for their neighbors, and said,
"coercion, intimidation is a
very deadly thing that leads
only to conflict. All nations,
all people deserve respect
no matter how large or how

small."
Still, he said he looks for-
ward to having an honest,
straightforward dialogue
with the Chinese to talk about
ways the two nations and their
militaries can -work better
together.
The announcement of the
deployments of additional
destroyers to Japan came as
tensions with North Korea
spiked again, with Pyong-
yang continuing to threaten
additional missile and nuclear
tests.
In recent weeks the North
has conducted a series of
rocket and ballistic missile
launches that are considered
acts of protest against annual
ongoing springtime military
exercises by Seoul and Wash-
ington. North Korea says the
exercises are rehearsals for
invasion.
North and South Korea also
fired hundreds of artillery
shells into each other's waters
in late March in the most
recent flare-up.

Credit where credit is due
University policy on transfer credit will help students economically
The Newnan Academic Advising Center sent out an e-mail
Wednesday informing LSA students of a new transfer credit
policy that allows all students, regardless of class standing, to
transfer credits earned at a community college starting this Spring Term.
This policy eliminates a previous rule that only permitted students with
fewer than 60 credits to transfer community college credit. In light of
this new policy, students with more than 60 credits, who are of junior
or senior standing, can now transfer credits from a community college.
The change is a positive move because it helps lower economic barriers
to higher education and allows for greater schedule flexibility without
diminishing the quality of a degree earned at the University.

The previous policy was initially
implemented with the logic that upperclassmen
shouldn't be able to receive credit from
community colleges because they teach first-
and second-year courses. However, Tim Dodd,
director of the Newnan Academic Advising
Center, contended that juniors and seniors
aren't prevented from taking and receiving
credit for 100- and 200-level courses here at the
University - so allowing more transfer credit
flexibility was essentially harmless.
This new policy helps level the playing field
for students of upper-level standing that need
to take courses off campus but can't afford
to pay for the more expensive credit costs of
a four-year university. This spring, in-state
credits for part-time students cost $690 for
the first credit and $510 for every additional
credit while out-of-state credits cost $1,825 for
the first credit and $1,645 for every additional
credit at the University according to the Office
of the Registrar. The typical community college
credit is much cheaper. For example, in-district
students at Oakland Community College
pay $76.40 per credit and resident students
at Schoolcraft College pay $90 per credit.
Furthermore, itallows students to stay at home
over the summer and take classes, rather than
paying for housing in Ann Arbor.
Accordingto a U.S. Department ofEducation
profile of 2007-08 first-time bachelor's degree
recipients, which included full-time as well

as part-time students, it took an average of six
years and four months to obtain a bachelor's
degree. For any number of reasons, it can be
hard for students to graduate in four years. This
can lead to an increase in education costs and
delays in career plans. Many students have to
work their way through school and others are
working toward dual degrees. Managing their
time and credits can be hard without taking
classes over the summer. The greater flexibility
this policy provides can help students earn
their degree ina more timely manner and start
paying offtheir student loans.
Transferred community college credits
are still subject to approval by the University,
so the quality of a University degree will not
decline as aresultofthis policy; the onlything
that really changes is how long a student
can take advantage of community college
classes. Allowing upperclassmen to transfer
community college credits doesn't change
what counts toward a University degree; 60
of the 120 credits needed to graduate still
can't be transferred from other institutions,
and the University can still deem credits unfit
for transfer.
This policy comes with essentially no costs
and has the benefits of saving students money
and helping them graduate in four years.
It is now easier and more cost-efficient for
students to fulfill requirements and graduate
in a timely manner.

MELISSA SCHOLKE I
An unnecessary hurdle

The reverberations of an opening gunshot
startled ears throughout the public sphere
years ago. While other states made mad
dashes across untread territory toward new
ideas about equality, Michigan slept on the
sidelines. March 21st, however, Michigan
pinned the number 18 onto its shirt and
sprinted to catch up in this race to provide the
marriage rights homosexual couples lawfully
deserve. Initiated by District Judge Bernard
Friedman's momentous decision to revoke a
ban created in 2004, Michigan became the
18th state in the country to abolish restrictions
on same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples and
their supporters rejoiced throughout the state.
Hundreds of couples flocked to county clerk
offices on Saturday morning to be legally
united and recognized as both spouses and
parents. In fact, 300 couples proclaimed their
vows to one another during the weekend when
the initial declaration was made.
As a fervent advocate for the LGBTQ
community and a genuinely concerned human
being, I realize flawed notions like "normality"
don't exist in real life. Any politician or any
voter concerned about the dismantling of
"traditional family values" honestly needs to
pull their minds out of the world of'50s sitcoms.
Reading the news about the court decision
excited me and reinstalled a shard of my broken
faith in Michigan's government. Sure, the state
wasexceedinglysluggishin acknowledgingthis
breach of constitutional freedom. Yes, 10 years
is a ridiculously and obscenely longtime to deny
individuals the rights to marry whoever they
love and to provide stability for their children.
I'll admit I sometimes am overly enthusiastic
and far too emotionally invested in my opinions
about LGBTQ rights. Yet, I know progress is
still worthwhile regardless of an unreasonably
long delay. Earlier in the month, I set aside my
usual annoyance with Michigan's government.
Despite my mental image of a state panting and
choking upon the dust of its 17 teammates as it
slowly jogged along the path they left behind, I
was satisfied to finally see Michigan running in
this race for equality.
My pride and zeal quickly toppled over.
Within the same Saturday when about 322
marriages occurred in the state, Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette placed an
entirely unnecessary hurdle in the way.
Michigan was finally gaining momentum and
pushing itself to achieve equality. Within a
moment, however, the same metaphorical 18th

runner crashed into Schuette's appeal with
arms and legs flailing, and collapsed onto the
ground. Due to the unjust action of the state's
appeals court, a bruised and bloody Michigan
remained unconscious in the pathway -
covered in the homophobic dirt other states
kicked off their sneakers.
Michigan's members of the LGBTQ
community were at a similar impasse. Last
week, Gov. Rick Snyder told happy newlyweds
that their marriages wouldn't be recognized
by the state. Thankfully, U.S. Attorney General
Eric Holder intervened on the matter and
prevented the frustrated couples from waiting
to hear whether state government officials
would strip them of their constitutional rights.
The rationale used to justify this egregious
breach of human rights in my mind is far worse
than the request for an appeal of Friedman's
decision, and the state's reinstitution of the ban
is too inexcusable to remain unnoticed.
This entire situation oflegaluncertainty and
irresponsibility is based upon concerns about
the sanctity of marriage, providing the best
home environment for children, and decisions
made by voters 10 years ago. Lawmakers were
instantly prepared to hash out the cliched
argument that same-sex marriage is immoral
and has negative effects upon children, but
the studies are contradictory. If Michigan's
leaders truly had the well-being of citizens
and children in mind, they would realize
removing the stigma associated with same-sex
marriage would lessen the stress, harassment
and insecurity couples and families regularly
face. Abandoning the defense of archaic voting
decisions is in the best interest of Michigan's
citizens. It's 2014! Times and opinions have
changed, and there's a whole new crop of
voters who disagree with this ancient ruling.
In this scenario, the federal government
shouldn't have needed to clean up Schuette
and Snyder's mess. By issuing the appeal and
dangling the possibility of marriage rights in
front of both married and unmarried LGBTQ
members, Michigan officials are sending the
message our brothers, sisters, parents, friends,
roommates and classmates don't deserve
the full extent of their constitutional rights
because they refuse to be stuffed into this
nice, restricting imaginary box of normalcy
and creating these hurdles is the only way to
keep them from escaping.

The debate on climate change is
over. Last month, scientists from
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the world's
largestgeneralscientificsociety, said
evidence of human-caused climate
change is as conclusive as evidence
linking smoking and lung cancer. In
a report titled "What We Know: The
Reality, Risks and Response to Cli-
mate Change" AAAS explained that,
like the consensus among the health
community regarding the risks of
smoking, "a similar consensus now
exists among climate scientists, a
consensus that maintains climate
change is happening, and human
activity is the cause." The debate
now shifts to what can be done.
March 20, our law student organi-
zation - Law Students for Respon-
sible Divestment from Fossil Fuels 9
- presented in front of the Universi-
ty's Board of Regents, and proposed
a step in the right direction. In a
20-page detail-filled proposal, we
argued that the University should
divest its endowment from coal and
oil equities and bonds. These invest-
ments represent the companies that
are the primary drivers of climate
change - both because of their
emissions and because of their mis-
information campaigns.
While there have been other
divestment efforts regarding fossil
fuels, LSRD's approach sets us
apart. First, we focus on a much
smaller subset of investments: just
coal and oil equities and bonds.
These make up only about 1 percent
of the University's endowment. In
contrast, the student-run Divest
and. Invest campaign (with whom
we've worked closely and who is
co-sponsoring this proposal) is
asking the regents for a complete
divestment from fossil fuels. This
touches on near 10 percent of the
endowment. Further, they are asking
the University to re-invest that
money in "socially, environmentally
and economically responsible
companies." While we support its
efforts, our proposal is different.
We're talking about substantially
less money, taken only from the two
primary drivers of climate change,
and we are not requesting that the
University re-invest their money in
any particular way.
Our request is also different from
divestment proposals on other cam-
puses. Probablythemost public cam-
paign is the one at Harvard. They're

asking for divestment from direct
and indirect holdings from the top
200 publicly traded fossil fuel com-
panies. We, on the other hand, are
only discussing direct investments,
and we're only discussing coal and
oil, not natural gas.
But most importantly, our
proposal is unique from other
divestment campaigns because it is
based on the precedents established
from past successful divestment
efforts at the University, which
was outlined in a directive by the
University's Chief Financial Officer.
That, in large part, is why our "ask"
is so narrowly tailored - to ensure
that we meet this precedent.
Of note, the only times the
University has chosen to divest from
specific companies were in 1978
when it divested from companies
supporting apartheid, and, perhaps
not coincidentally, in 2000 when it
divested from tobacco companies.
In our proposal, we explain that
there is a clear, three-step approach
for divestment efforts: 1) The con-
cern tobe explored (climate change)
must express the broadly and con-
sistently held position of the cam-
pus community over time; 2) There
must be reason to believe that the
behavior or action in question may
be antithetical to the core mission
and values of the University; and 3)
There must be reason to believe that
the organization, industry or entity
to be singled out (coal and oil indus-
tries) may be uniquely responsible
for the problems identified. We're
confident that the investments in
coal and oil meet these standards.
First, there is a clear consensus on
campus that climate change exists
and that it poses real threats. Some
examples are the administration's
commitment to reducing Univer-
sity carbon emissions 25 percent by
2025, the educational pursuits of the
University's professors and students
andthe literallyhundreds of student
initiatives dedicated to sustainabil-
ity and combating climate change.
Second, the actions of the coal
and oil industries are antithetical
to the University's core mission
and values. As University President
Mary Sue Coleman said in a 2011
address, "Sustainability defines
the University of Michigan." A
perpetual reliance on coal and oil
does not align with this definition.
Beyond being antithetical to the
University's core value of sustain-

ability, the coal and oil industries'
actions mock the University's com-
mitment to academic integrity.
These two industries have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars on
lobbying efforts to thwart meaning-
ful legislative solutions on climate
change, and to create dubiously
named organizations such as the
Global Climate Coalition to under-
mine the scientific consensus on this
topic. LSRD believes, as the tobacco
divestment committee did, that "the
brazen dishonesty of (these indus-
tries) for so many years about a mat-
ter of such enormous public-health
significance is ... unquestionably
antithetical to the core missions of
the University." Investment in these
industries simply cannot be squared
with a University's commitment to
higher education.
Lastly, the actions of the coal and
oil industries make them uniquely
responsible for climate change.
First, of all the CO2 ever emitted by
burningfossil fuels, a full 83 percent
comes from just coal and oil. While
that is in part because of a long-
standing dependence on these prod-
ucts, coal and oil also emit far more
CO2 per unit of energy created than
other available fossil fuels, such as
natural gas (82 percent and 40 per-
cent more, respectively), and infi-
nitely more than renewable energy
resources. In short, coal and oil have
been, and will continue to be, the
primary drivers of climate change.
LSRD recognizes that the
endowment should not be used
primarily as a political tool. But, as
the University itself has recognized,
sometimes a set of investments
involves "such significant social or
moral implications ... that normal
investment practices should be
altered." The coal and oil industries
- as the primary drivers of climate
change and the misinformation
campaigns that have paralyzed steps
to counteract it - are investments
that meet this standard.
LSRD realizes that divestment
is just one step in the much larger
fight to combat climate change. That
being said, regardless of how large
an effect divestment may have, we
believe there is a value in being true
to your values, and currently, the
University is not living up to its own.

and feels like something plucked as Anderson rhythmically leads

us through Dignan and Anthony
Adams's 75-year plan to conduct
several heists after leaving a vol-
untary psychiatric unit. Things
inevitably go wrong. The audi-
ence continues snapping. And
then, in his last line, Dignan
looks at Anthony and says, "Isn't
it funny that you used to be in the
nuthouse and now I'm in jail."
If not sad, it's a surprisingly
touching moment, a little bit
reminiscent of those instants in
childhood of being jerked back
to reality as your parents called
for dinner while you played
outside. Except, of course, the
consequences here were much
more real. In the words of Mar-
tin Scorsese, "The central ideasof
the film is so delicate, so human:
Agroup ofyoungguys think that
their lives have to be filled with
risk and danger in order to be
real. They don't know that it's
okay simply to be who they are."
It's those brief, crippling sec-
onds of gloom that add dimen-
sion and perspective to what can
be called Anderson's otherwise
repetitive work. In "The Grand
Budapest Hotel," he spends
nearly two hours distancing us
from the hostile racial politics
of mid-20th century Europe. It's
a story within a story within a
story set in the snow-globe-like
exclusion of an old hotel in a
country that doesn't exist. The
main character is flamboyant,
unhinged from reality - almost
aloof to the chaos, dressed in
Nazi-suggestive uniforms,
encircling his beloved hotel.
The central plot is complete-
ly detached from these poli-
tics, choosing instead to focus
on Europe's cultured, well-
groomed tendencies. It isn't
until the last few minutes of the
film do we see M. Gustave take
a stand, stare fascism in the face
and spit. He pays for it with his
life. He becomes "a glimmer
of civilization in the barbaric
slaughterhouse we know as
humanity."
I'm still not completely sure
why I love Wes Anderson. But I
know it's more than just dream-
like nostalgia - it's the tiny
little minute before I wake up
from that dream and float back
to reality. It's the warm blan-
ket of detachment. It's a pil-
low of promised escapism. In
the words of my predecessor,
"it's something that clings to us
throughout adulthood." A glim-
mer of civilization in the bar-
baric slaughterhouse we know
as humanity.effects have already
started manifesting in beautiful
character work.
And that matters a lot more
than just a shocking twist.

What you know about the Boom Clap Bachelors?
Sampling or theft?:
Hip hop's conundrum

To what extent great effect. 9th Wonder, Just
Blaze, RZA, DJ Premier and
does the genre's J Dilla all helped to push the
sampling frontier. Over the
borrowing cross past two decades, certain art-
ists and songs have become

Mayfield, James Brown and

Daily Arts Writer tainly among the most popu-

The links connecting rap,
soul, blues and funk form
are enormously important to
hip-hop culture. By sampling
their forefathers, rappers pay
homage to the genre's musical
roots, and in the process, put
a modern spin on recogniz-
able classics. The practice of
"sampling" is not unique to
hip hop, or even contempo-
rary music. It's a long-stand-
ing tradition that has always
lived in the shadows, but was
launched into the limelight
when rap exploded in the late
'80s.
Kanye West was correct
when he said, "Rap is the new
rock 'n' roll. We the rock-
stars." Modern rap is less
about mastering an instru-
ment than it is about hon-
ing one's musical knowledge
across genres, and recycling
the old to make something
new. Despite sampling's lon-
gevity, the practice is not
really well known. Given its
increasingly central role in
modern music, it's time to
reach a consensus on when
sampling is acceptable, and
when it's not. Doing so is dif-
ficult and raises important
creative and ethical questions
- who deserves credit for
what, and in what form? Does
sampling promote creativity
or does it impede innovation?
When sampling is done
well, it uses a musical frag-
ment as a point of departure
to build something original.
Kanye West may be the con-
temporary master of sam-
pling in hip hop, but he's far
from the first to use it to

lar.
The majority of rappers
aren't simply reusing old
songs as their own, they are
transforming them rhyth-
mically, melodically and
lyrically to fit a modern para-
digm. In such circumstances,
old artists benefit from the
revival of their material and
new artists are able to chan-
nel their influences for inno-
vative purposes. All music is
part of a complicated evolu-
tionary tree - sampling helps
maintain ancestral roots.
Sometimes, a sample can be
used to convey two messages
within one song. In Kanye's
"Jesus Walks," "Niggaz!" is
yelled out at the end of sev-
eral verses. Although this
exclamation is fairly com-
monplace in Kanye's work,
it's actually a sample from
Curtis Mayfield's "If There's
a Hell Below." By employ-
ing this subtle sample, West
creates a clever parallel that
both enhances his song and
pays tribute to an influential
figure, placing their works
along a cultural continuum.
Sometimes a sample is not
iconic or old enough to be con-
sidered a tribute. How much
manipulation is required to
transform a little known con-
temporary song into a rap
original? It's a slippery slope
in terms of context. Kendrick
Lamar's "Bitch Don't Kill My
Vibe," is almost identical to
"Tiden Flyver," a 2008 track
by a contemporary group of
Danish producers called the
Boom Clap Bachelors. They
received credit as compos-
ers on good kid, m.A.A.d. city,

but sampling an entire con-
temporary melody is differ-
ent than taking a few lines
from a classic rock, soul or
blues song. Kendrick layers
their music with new lyr-
ics and effects to make it his
own. These circumstances are
common - producers create
beats and sell them to rap-
pers. However, oftentimes it
takes a significant amount of
research on the part of the lis-
tener to discern what is sam-
pled, and where the sample
comes from. Although Lamar
cites "Tiden Flyver" as the
source for the sample, it is not
done in a highly visible way
- Most people assume that
rap songs like "Bitch Don't
Kill My Vibe" are entirely
original productions. What's
the difference between sam-
pling a less well-known peer
like the Boom Clap Bachelors
and a dead legend like James
Brown? It's simple - Who the
fuck has heard of the Boom
Clap Bachelors? In cases like
these, rappers get most of the
credit while nameless artists
do most of the heavy lifting.
Sampling is a catalyst for
musical progress - It pro-
motes collaboration, innova-
tion and historical awareness.
By bridging the past and
present, sampling can repur-
pose old voices to enhance
the creative efforts of mod-
ern musicians. At the same
time, aspects of this practice
can have unintended conse-
quences. Is appropriation the
same as theft, or is it a form of
flattery? In an age of globally-
shared music, co-opting the
creative efforts of promising,
undiscovered artists in order
to craft hip-hop instrumen-
tals with dissociated messages
will cause musical evolution
to change course, for better
or worse. The question is,
when you discover that your
favorite rap song was made
in Copenhagen, not Compton,
does that kill your vibe?

emotionally satisfying and
thrilling episode. Over the
course of its two and a half
hour runtime, there were many
small yet powerful emotional
moments in both the "side-
ways world" and on the island.
Scenes like the one with Saw-
yer and Juliet by the vending
machine "remembering" their
love for each other or Jack and
Kate saying goodbye to each
other on the island were what
made the finale what it was:
a showcase of the emotional
moments that made "Lost"
great. The last several minutes
brought me to tears - thanks
to a great performance by Mat-
thew Fox ("Party of Five") and
some beautiful music from
Michael Giacchino ("Up").
Those moments reminded me
what I loved most about the
show, which is exactly what
a series should focus on right
before it goes away. Did we get
every answer? No. What we
did get, however, were some
great moments that reminded
us why "Lost" will forever be a
part of the TV lexicon.
-ALEX INTNER

Breaking Bad
If there's one line in the series
finale of "Breaking Bad" that
summarizes Walter White, it's
this: "I did it for me ... I liked
it ... I was good at it ... I was
really ... I was alive." Despite
being placed in the single
worst situation imaginable,
Walter White wasn't going to
go out like a punk. It would
have been easy for the series
to end ambiguously with Walt
dying alone in an isolated
cabin. Instead, we got one of
the most satisfying conclu-
sions to a TV series ever. Even
if it was expected, it was so
important for the story being
told not to simply cop out with
a "crime doesn't pay" moral.
This wasn't a show about the
drug trade, politics or why one
cause is better than another. It
was about a man named Wal-
ter White who wanted to be
remembered for something
- even if that something was
cooking meth. By the end of the
series, everything that needed
to be said was said.

didn't get all of the answers
to every little question (the

M*A*S*H
When explaining why
"M*A*S*H" 's finale is the best,
it's important to note that it's
the most-watched finale in tele-
vision history. But in reality,
you don't even have to turn to the
quantity over quality argument,
because the finale had both. The
story concluded the long running
episodic dramedy that followed
the medical staff at an army hos-
pital, and it retained an impres-
sive wide-range appeal without
sacrificing a second of quality.
Given that it's also 30 years old
and still holds up, even if you
don'tagree with its anti-war mes-
sage, it's hard to deny its signifi-
cance. "M*A*S*H" shows with its
finale that, despite its 11 year run,
it never lost the primary reason
behind its success: a strong sense
of humanity.
-JOE REINHARD
Six Feet Under
When I first saw the ending of
"Six Feet Under," I was floored.
It was the best series finale I
had ever seen. And despite the
many fantastic finales that have
come and gone (from "Friday
Night Lights" to "Medium" to
"Breaking Bad"), my opinion
hasn't changed. Holistically,
the episode is spectacular -
eventful, sad, reflective. The
final moments cement its lega-
cy - a seven-minute flash-for-
ward encapsulating the big life
moments and deaths of every
major character. Set perfectly to
Sia's "Breathe Me," the montage
is as chilling and heartbreaking
as you'd expect from "Six Feet
Under," and as satisfying as you'd
hope a series finale would be. Alan
Ball's dark drama ended with
emotion and confidence almost 10
years ago, and I'm still not over it
- which is probably why I watch
that iconic ending every few
months on YouTube.
-ALEC STERN
Friday Night Lights
February marked three years
since "Friday Night Lights"
wrapped up its series finale, had
my mother crying silently in the
living room and finally pushed
Coach to drift away from all of
our lives for good. But I didn't
start watching the show until
more than two years later, when
it was available in marathon-
able format, refurbished for
unhealthy viewing by the super-

human drug/TV-pusher that is
Netflix. Two years later, I saw
poetry in the way Taylor turned
his back, a smile on his face and
a hand wrapped around his
wife's shoulder.
He did it for all the right
reasons. After 76 episodes that
brought out the best of tele-
vision - a show built around
its characters with arcs that
emphasized the nuanced simi-
larities between parenthood and
mentorship. Coach's turn in the
spotlight was over and his deci-
sion to hand it over to his wife,
quitting his job in the process,
wasn't just the correct choice, it
emphasized what the series had
been about from the beginning:
decency. Vince was right. You
changed lives, Coach. Clear eyes
full hearts can't lose.
-AKSHAY SETH
Friends
I was a third grader when
"Friends" ended in the spring
of 2004. I remember because
on May 5, I had to explain to
my teacher, Mrs. Roser, that I
was yawning so much in class
not because I was bored, but
because I had stayed up too late
the night before. I had never
seen the show "Friends" and
I probably didn't understand
most of the jokes, but I refused
to miss out on watching the
finale. That's how big of a cul-
tural phenomenon it was.
The ending of what is prob-
ably the most iconic sitcom of
all time was nothing short of a
perfect match with the show's
overall tone. The six titular
friends were all getting ready
to start a new chapter in their
lives - whether it was Chan-
dler and Monica welcoming
their (surprise) twins into
the world or Ross and Rachel
finally getting together after
Rachel's "I got off the plane"
moment. The last moments
spent in Monica's empty apart-
ment were some of the series'
biggest tearjerkers, and yet
the writers still managed to
work a joke about Ross's short-
lived and unsuccessful dance
career into the dialogue. There
has never been a sitcom that
finds the humor and raw emo-
tion in the average lives of
twentysomethings as well as
"Friends" did. It changed the
genre forever, and the show's
finale was the perfect cap on
that legacy.

FESTIFOOLS

foot traffic, while students take
part in a challenging, engaging
form of self-expression.
"Because I've been with my stu-
dents for the last couple of months,
I'm really looking forward to how
my students respond to this expe-
rience," Tucker said. "Obviously
we aren't trying to make profes-
sional puppet makers, but I'm
excited to see how this experience
meshes with their career goals."
Students participated in bring-
ing their creations to life and also
came to support friends and enjoy
the festival. The beautiful, intri-
cate and sometimes frightening

puppets seemed to capture the
spirit of Ann Arbor, according to
students.
LSA freshman Florence Rivkin
came to support the participants
and said it's an event she looks for-
ward to each year.
"It's very interesting. I think it's

sive, and they seem to be bringing
a lot of joy to all of the little kids

Arbor - avery Ann Arbor thing to
do"
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje,
who attended the event, and Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man were two of the inspirations
for the giant look-alike puppets.
Though the festival has become

a widely anticipated Ann Arbor
staple, this was the first year the
University's School of Art and
Design chose not to participate.
Tucker said he believes their
absence only creates an opportu-
nity for new creations and ideas
to flourish, as both students and
members of the community can
participate in the creation and uti-
lization of the puppets.
"I think we are lucky we live in
a town that has such a strong con-
nection to the University," Tucker
said. "It is interesting and reward-
ing to figure out that they live in
this huge, broader community. I
think FestiFools is one of the many
artistic offerings in this town and I
think it is unique to this campus -
it doesn't happen anywhere else in
the country."

'Zombies' invade local community center

School of Public
Health students hold
emergency response
simulation
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
Zombies invaded Ann Arbor
Saturday, but citizens need not
worry. A joint team from the Uni-
versity's School of Public Health
and Washtenaw County Public
Health contained the incident
and effectively treated all sub-
jects who had been exposed to
the Toxoplasma zombie parasite.
In reality, Saturday's disas-
ter preparedness exercise at
the Washtenaw County Learn-
ing Resource Center served an
important role in preparing
community health officials for
a potential emergency. Though
the simulation used "zombies"
- volunteers from the commu-
nity who were provided makeup
prior to the event - the exercise

was intended to test the ability
of local public health agencies to
respond to a wide array of possi-
ble scenarios in the community,
such as a bioterrorism attack, flu
outbreak or natural disaster.
In the years since the Sept. 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, govern-
ment agencies, such as the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, have
invested heavily in community
preparedness programs such as
the "zombie invasion." While
zombies do not present a serious
threat to communities, the CDC
launched the national program
to help local agencies better pre-
pare for any disaster..
"If you are generally well
equipped to deal with a zombie
apocalypse you will be prepared
for a hurricane, pandemic, earth-
quake, or terrorist attack," wrote
Ali Kahn, director of the CDC's
Office of Public Health Pre-
paredness and Response.
The event, organized through
the School of Public Health,
serves the dual purpose of pre-
paring public response measures
and teaching students about

dealing with outbreaks or other
disasters. In particular, the sim-
ulation applies principles taught
in the graduate course "Applied
Epidemiology," allowing stu-
dents to see in action the proce-
dures they study over the course
of a semester.
Associate Epidemiology
Prof. Eden Wells, director of
the preventative medicine resi-
dency, called this year's event
a "functional exercise." While
she implemented a similar event
last year to help her class bet-
ter understand the material,
this year's event had the added
element of involving local pub-
lic health agencies, giving the
students a chance to partake in
a more realistic and beneficial
exercise.
"These events are really fun to
engage with, but they reallyneed
to be developed with concrete
goals and objectives," Wells said.
"It's fun if you just want to have
a zombie event, but for this we're
actually undertaking (the event)
with specific teaching competen-
cies in mind."

Wells said Saturday's exercise
was intended to simulate a "point
of dispensing" scenario. The
procedure is used when public
health officials need to distrib-
ute a large volume of treatments,
medication or vaccination over
an entire community population.
In such cases, both efficiency
and preparedness are key in
delivering the care people need
in a timely manner.
"Theyneedtobe able todothis
for a large number of people in a
short period of time, so it really
is a plan that has to be exercised
quite often, because you con-
tinually need volunteers to help
set up and you need the ability
to keep the experience fresh in
everybody's mind," Wells said.
Throughout the simulation,
volunteers were assigned vari-
ous roles - either as zombies
seeking treatment or uninfected
individuals seeking vaccina-
tion - and given instructions
regarding how to behave and
how to answer certain medical
questions. The response work-
ers were then responsible for

managing the treatment process
as the "patients" moved through
the POD site.
The response workers also
had to deal with a variety of
challenging scenarios that could
be experienced in a real-life sce-
nario, such as language barriers,
unaccompanied children, dis-
abled individuals and potentially
contagious subjects.
Susan Ringler-Cerniglia,
Washtenaw County Public
Health Department public infor-
mation officer, said the exercise
provided a way for the public
health workers to assess poten-
tial areas of improvement in
their procedures. While plans
often look great on paper, she
said problems often come to light
once such plans are implement-
ed.
As bottlenecks in the process
were identified, the officials
leading the event were able to
reallocate resources and work-
ers, thus ensuring a smooth flow
of patients through the treat-
ment area. All patients leaving
the POD received a bag of jelly

beans, which represented medi-
cation that would be distributed
in the case of a real-world emer-
gency.
Public Health graduate stu-
dent Matthew Shearer, one of
the event coordinators, said
the complexity and variety of
potential public health concerns
makes POD scenarios a "pretty
sizable undertaking." He added
that students can benefit from
seeing simulations rather than
experiencing the procedure for
the first time during a real emer-
gency situation.
"It gives people something
familiar and fun to take part in,
but it also gives us the platform
to really express the important
of preparedness," Shearer said.
"We want to inform the com-
munity that public health pre-
paredness starts with you. We
can put out all of the information
we want, but people need to take
ownership of themselves, their
families and friends and make
sure they have plans and materi-
als available in the event some-
thinghappens."

Spring Game
offers hints at new
5 schemes, tactics
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily SportsuEditor
Michigan football's biggest
story this spring, sans the
-offensive line, has been the
rebuilding of its offense. The
chief signing this offseason
wasn't the No. 3 overall prospect

in defensive back Jabrill Peppers,
but it was former Alabama
offensive coordinator Doug
Nussmeier.
So, when Michigan held its
Spring Game on Saturday, fans
and media alike came to watch
the offense, and whatever magic
Nussmeier could bring from
Tuscaloosa.
"All I can say is (Nussmeier's)
done an excellent job in teaching
(the new offense)," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "Obviously,
he's here because we think he's
an awfully good football coach
in all areas. ... (But) room for

improvement? Oh my gosh,
there's no question, we need a lot
of improvement - but the way
it's being taught has been real
positive."
As Hoke has been saying since
practice began a few weeks ago,
only remedial plays would be
unveiled to the public this spring.
And the fourth-year coach was
telling the truth, as most of what
the Wolverines showed Saturday
was "vanilla," as quarterback
Devin Gardner called it.
The "vanilla" offense kicked

on the walk
to his car by a
statue.
The imposing figure is Bo
Schembechler, the most famous
figure in Michigan sports. It's
the first outdoor statue of an
individual in the 197 years of
the University, all part of the
new renovation to the football
facilities.
Confused, Brandon walks
over to the statue.
Bo Schembechler: Dave,
it's been a while. Gotta admit, I
don't love this new statue, but
you're the boss now, not me.
Dave Brandon: I knew you'd
be too humble to be a fan of it,
but it's a great opportunity to
draw attention to the Michigan
brand. Did you see the Towsley
Museum inside the new Hall?
It'll be a great recruiting tool.
BS: Looks great. Has getting
recruits really been an issue over
the last few years?
DB: Well, no. We've had a
top-20 recruiting class every
year for the past three seasons,
actually. Our 'J. Ira and Nicki
Harris Family Head Football
Coach,' Brady Hoke, is quite the
recruiter.
BS: Sounds like it. The team
has got to be pretty successful

then, right?
DB: Well, sort of. We won
the Sugar Bowl in 2011, but last
season we got to just seven wins.
Had one of the worst offensive
lines in college football even
though an NFL team will draft
two of the five starters in May.
Rushed for minus-48 yards
against Michigan State. Got beat
up by Kansas State in the Buffalo
Wild Wings Bowl. But, we've got
an exciting schedule the next
two years against non-rivalry
teams. Appalachian State. Utah.
Miami (Ohio). BYU. Oregon
State. UNLV. Playing against
new opponents is a great way
to build our brand, plus, we're
almost through with having to
play Notre Dame. Thank God.
Those games were always so
boring.
BS: But is the team going to be
any good? How'd they do in the
Spring Game?
DB: Bo, sorry, but it's the
Spring Game presented byPNC.
Sponsoring every event we run
helps build the brand. Anyway, it
went fine. Devin Gardner threw
an interception on the first play
of the day and couldn't place any
throws, the offensive line could
be even worse than last season's
and we didn't have enough
depth to play an actual game,
but besides that, I think people
were excited! Must be leftover
from the Big House soccer
announcement.
BS: What soccer
announcement? I didn't think
the Michigan soccer team could
draw that many people!
DB: Well, err, it's not exactly
related to Michigan. But it's
very exciting. Two of the most
famous clubs in the word, Real
Madrid and Manchester United,
will be playing a friendly in the
Big House in August. Trying
to set the record for most fans
to ever witness a soccer game.

JAMES COffa
Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon shouldn't treat the University like it needs to sell itself out to make itself known on the national stage, writes Cook.

Classic, I think it'll go well.
Great for the brand.
BS: So in the span of nine
months, Michigan will be
hosting two events that
have nothing to do with the
University? What's next, Dave? A
WWE match? An NBA game? A
NASCAR race?
DB: Those are actually great
ideas! Let me write some of
those down. Can't ever have too
many opportunities to build the
brand.
BS: I mean, is the money at
least going toward something
worthwhile?
DB: Of course! Some of it's
going toward general student
scholarships, but we're also'
going to construct a new soccer
facility.
BS: The old stadium must be

pretty run down, then?
DB: Oh, yeah. I mean the
thing was built in 2010. How
am I supposed to build the
brand with all these decrepit old
facilities?
BS: So you're doing alot of
construction projects, then?
DB: Of course! Yost Ice Arena
and the Crisler Center just got
facelifts, and we're redoing
the entire South Campus.
We're getting rid of all the old
buildings and facilities, like
Ferry Field, and creating the
shiny new Stephen M. Ross
Athletic Campus. All of these
brand new buildings will really
show off the rich tradition and
history of Michigan.
BS: You're getting rid of
historic Ferry Field? Where
Jesse Owens set four world

records in 45 minutes? What
new facility is going there?
DB: Well, actually, a parking
lot. But that's beside the point.
BS: Dave, I don't know about
that. CanI give you some advice?
DB: Always, coach.
BS: You're focusing too much
on building up a brand that
already exists. The influence and
power of Michigan existed well
before you, and it will exist far
after you. You know what builds
brands? Winning. The basketball
team didn't build up its brand
with that fancy new Crisler
Center or with those highlighter
Adidas jerseys. It built up that
brand by making two Elite Eight
games in two seasons, without
excuses about age or anything
else. That team just won, plain
and simple, and that's why that

brand is so popular. The same
thing will happen with football,
or anything else. Start treating
Michigan like the historic place
it is, not like a second-rate
university that needs to make
a splash on the national scene.
This was Michigan well before
you got here, Dave. Don't lose
sight of that.
Brandon begins to respond, but

tenacity in the linebackers
and corners.
It took more than an hour
for stretching, punting drills
and positional warm-ups to
finally transition into an actual
scrimmage. And then? On the
first play, fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
threw an interception. On the
next, a run was stuffed for no
gain. And on the last snap of
the opening drive, Gardner was
knocked to the ground while
throwing, yellow no-contact
jersey be damned.
Answers? We got a few.
Freshman Mason Cole did, in
fact, start at left tackle, and
he held his own against Frank
Clark. Freddy Canteen, the
freshman receiver who likes to
brag about his athleticism, made
a streaking 40-yard reception.
Devin Funchess has shed

the apocryphal label of tight
end, and the junior is still the
Wolverines' biggest downfield
threat as a wideout.
But Gardner made ill-
advised throws, like the ones
that plagued him last year.
The offensive line gave in to
the pressure so quickly that
the quarterbacks shrugged
their shoulders, helpless to the
assault. Canteen's catch, the
offensive highlight of the day,
was equal parts good offensive
execution and defensive
breakdown.
Afterward, Hoke sat in the
press room and explained it all
away.
"I thought we were just a
little inconsistent," he said.
Then show us that
consistency, coach. A fanbase is
waiting.
There are 147 days until the
mistakes matter.

Aug. 30, the Wolverines will
touch the banner and be greeted
by 'The Victors.' The captains
will meet at midfield, and then
the ball will be put on a tee and
booted across the field.
Then, 'Team 135' will etch
its chapter in the book that is
Michigan football.
In April, there are 147 days
left to fix the interceptions,
the dropped passes, the
missed assignments. Against
Appalachian State, Notre Dame
and the rest? That's when it
matters. Right now, there's
still time to turn a roster of
100-plus athletes into a Big Ten
Championship-caliber team.
That's why, even when they
don't know the names, the
children ask for autographs
from anyone walking off the
field in a Michigan uniform.
Right now, there's still hope.

pass from Gardner, who was
looking for freshman receiver
Freddy Canteen on a fly route but
was intercepted by sophomore
Jourdan Lewis. It was Gardner's
first pass in front of fans since the
Ohio State game last November.
Before the scrimmage began,
though, all eyes were on the
offensive line and running back
drills. Freshman Mason Cole
practiced with the first team at
the starting left tackle position,
and redshirt junior Jack Miller
started at center, but both
could be bumped once redshirt
sophomore Erik Magnuson
and redshirt junior Graham
Glasgow return from injury
and suspension, respectively.
Cole did an admirable job
against Frank Clark, and only
a few members of the line gave
up would-be sacks - a vast
improvement from last season.
But even during preliminary
drills, the running backs
struggled to break through the
line. The only time they were
able to consistently generate
positive yardage was when the
defensive line was replaced with

a plastic strip.
And once the team began
scrimmaging an hour into
the event, the defensive line
consistently stuffed the backs.
The longest run of the afternoon
came from sophomore Derrick
Green, and it was for just eight
yards. The backs had the most
success when they ran to the
outside, avoiding work between
the tackles - illustrating once
again the line will need more
addressing this summer.
"Obviously we're missing
some pieces (on the line), but I
feel like they're playing well,"
Gardner said. "Coming into
the Spring Game, it's going to
be bland - you can't show too
much."
Entering the spring, Green
was the presumed starter,
but Saturday shed light on
sophomore De'Veon Smith as a
challenger for the spot. Redshirt
junior Justice Hayes is slotted to
be third, but all three had their
struggles breaking through.
Smith and Cole weren't the
only surprising starters for
the Wolverines on offense.
Nussmeier also had Canteen
starting out wide opposite junior
Devin Funchess, and the first-
year player has shown potential
early. The biggest crowd pleaser

of the day came on a 45-yard
play action catch and run from
Gardner to Canteen down the
left sideline.
When sophomorequarterback
Shane Morris took over the
second unit, he too looked for
Canteen out wide.
"He's earned his respect out
here (with) 14,15 practices now,"
Gardner said. "He's played well,
made plays and he's developed a
trust with all the quarterbacks.
We trust him and it's great he
came in as a big surprise."
With Funchess officially
deemed a wide receiver, junior
A.J. Williams is slotted as the
starting tight end, a position
where the Wolverines are very
thin after Jake Butt's ACL injury.
Recently converted tight end
Keith Heitzman also caught a
fewpasses. The formerdefensive
end played tight end in high
school, but predominately as a
blocker, so Nussmeier has been
trying outhis hands in practice.
With the Spring Game behind
it, Michigan sets its sights on
fall camp, where the rest of the
offense will be installed and the
entire freshman class will be
on campus. It's only then that
Nussmeier's offense can truly be
judged. But one thing is perfectly
clear: There is work to do.

Rather they, will likely be placed
in benches in the stands, leaving
the entire width of the field

Charlie Stillatano, CEO of
Relevant Sports, the marketing
company affiliated with the
event, said that workers will lay
a protective surface over the
turf field before loading trays of
sod on top. The process should
take about 48 hours to complete,
according to Stillatano.
Part of proceeds from the
event will be put to academic
scholarships, according to
Brandon, while the rest will go
to the construction of a new
soccer facility. The UM Soccer

The score was just enough
for the Stags' triumph over

afternoon, 9-8.
In accordance with its recent
trend, though, Michigan started
off the game poorly.

The second quarter was
different.
With the Wolverines still
looking to find their footing in
the game, Fairfield scored five
goals in the quarter, with the
last coming just three seconds
before the halftime whistle. The
Stags took an 8-4 lead into the
locker room.
"At halftime, I told the guys
the goals were going to come,"
Paul said. "If we started to get
a couple more posessions from
faceoffs, we were going to have
an opportunity to close the gap."
After the break, Michigan
seemed to find the on switch
and played a much better half,
starting with a snipe from fifth-
year midfielder Thomas Paras
with less than two minutes gone
in the stanza.
The Wolverines added two

more goals from the sticks
of Schlosser and sophomore
midfielder Kyle Jackson to close
the gap to one with almost a whole
quarter left to go in the game.
But both defenses held
their ground and the game
was scoreless for more than 12
minutes in the quarter.
Frederico's goal broke
the scoreless drought before
Michigan redshirt freshman
midfielder David Joseph
rocketed a shot from the point
to cut the deficit to one and
make the last 90 seconds of the
game intense.
"Joseph is an explosive
athlete," Paul said. "He's the
fastest guy in every game we play
so he has the capability of scoring
and we need him to do that."
But Fairfield escaped with a
one-goal win.
With a growing team in
just its third year as a varsity
program, Paul looks for
positives in each game, and on
this day, it was the defense.
Not only did the defense
hold the No. 15 program in the
nation to fewer than 10 goals,
but it also killed two man-up
situations - one of which came
when the Wolverines were
down two men.
With three games and the
ECAC post-season tournament
looming, the Wolverines know
they need to start playing
consistent lacrosse.
And this game was a good
start, despite the defeat.
"We played well, and come the
next couple games, teams aren't
going to want to play us because
we're going to come out strong as
we have been," Joseph said.

At thestart ofthe fourth inning
Sunday, the fans at Alumni Field
inched forward in their chairs,
almost in unison.
Usually, a none-on, none-out
at-bat in the middle of a game
wouldn't cause astir. But this one
was different. This was Sierra
Romero coming to the plate.
The sophomore shortstop
fouled off a high fastball on the
first pitch, then watched an
outside pitch go past her.
Ohio State's pitching had
stymied the Michigan softball
team the day before - it gave up
just five hits and one run - and
was on its way to more of the
same on Sunday. The Wolverines
had mustered only one hit in the
first three innings.
Romero, who struck out in
her first at-bat of the game, was
just happy that Buckeye right-
hander Olivia O'Reilly was
throwing her strikes. The day
before, O'Reilly had walked her
twice to start the game.
"I get so excited when I get a
strike," Romero said. "I know I'm
not going to get on every time,
but it's nice to get a chance to just
swingthe bat."
She did more -

of the season.
In that one swing, the
sophomore turned the game
on its head, as the Wolverines
poured on nine more runs in the
fourth and fifth innings to earn a
10-0 mercy-rule victory.
"It was just one of those things
where we needed one person to
hit it hard,"said senior designated
player Taylor Hasselbach, who
homered three batters later.

Romero turns tide in series

UNANAARCH^Y/Daily
Sophomore shortstop Sierra Romero is batting .512, but she helps Michigan win even when she's intentionally walked.

"Hitting is contagious."
It was a clutch hit. It was a
spark for a slumping offense. And
it was exactly the type of play
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
has grown accustomed to with
Romero on the roster.
"She's

the bat. Every
time the
Wolverines
need a big play,
Romero seems
to deliver - sometimes with a big
hit or deep home run, other times
with something intangible.
Sunday she provided the long
ball. Saturday, it was the latter.
In the first inning, with two
outs, Romero walked. Hutchins
called for Romero to steal second
base, which she did, easily.
Early in the game, the steal
didn't seem like much. But when

senior first baseman Caitlin
Blanchard singled through the
right side of the infield, Hutchins
waved Romero around third base
and toward the plate.
Ohio . State right-fielder
Caitlin Conrad got a good jump
on the ball, fielded it cleanly and
fired a laser to home plate, giving
Buckeye catcher Taylor Watkins
the ball with Romero still five
feet down the base path.
It should have been an easy
tag to end the inning.
But in a split second, Romero
dove headfirst for the corner of
the plate, beating Watkins' tag
and supplying the Wolverines
with their only run of the game
- the only one they would need
in a 1-0 victory.
"(Diving) was actually a last-
second decision," she said. "I
thought by diving I would limit
what parts of me she could
actually tag."
Michigan's roster, from top
to bottom, is filled with talent.
It has players who are heady,

players who are athletic and
plenty of leaders.
Romero is all of the above.
Her fielding is deliberate and
smooth, her base running
tactful and her plate presence
nearly impeccable. She's batting
.512 and gets on base in a jaw-
dropping 64 percent of her plate
appearances.
There's not an easy out in the
lineup, and yet Romero is fourth
in the nation with 1.03 walks
per game. Teams pitch around
her to face Blanchard, who bats
.333 and has 25 RBI.
They walk Romero so they
can pitch to a player who gets
a hit in one-third of her at-bats.
It's a ludicrous idea, yet it's the
right decision every time.
That's because when Romero
gets a strike, more times than
not, she's hitting it through the
infield or over the outfielders -
way over the outfielders.
So when she steps to the plate,
the crowd perks up. It would be
silly not to.

But Driesenga was just

Hutchins claimssher team's

runs always come in bunches.
That proved to be true at Alumni
Field in the bottom of the fourth.
The game was scoreless until
sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero hit a solo homer to
left field. Later that inning,
senior designated hitter Taylor
Hasselbach hit a two-run home
run and suddenly the Wolverines
had the momentum they needed.
"It was one of those things
where we needed one person
to hit it hard and we had
that happen, and hitting is
contagious," Hasselbach said.
The next inning, Driesenga
pitched a quick 1-2-3 frame for
Michigan to lead into the bottom

started to pick up.

Hasselbach hit

- to bring in four of those runs.

"I was just a little more

and it worked out in my favor."
After Hasselbach struck
out in each of her three at-bats
Saturday, it gave her a vote of
confidence when Hutchins put
her in again Sunday.
"Yesterday, she looked like the
old Taylor," Hutchins said. "She
struckout three times, not seeing
the ball, not really swinging to hit
it. I was really pleased to see her
pull herself out of it ... She needs
to know that I believe in her and
she's beengettingit done forus."
Michigan didn't rely on
any one player to carry it to its
series sweep of Ohio State. In
front of its home crowd, the
Wolverines relied on grandslams
and pitching, outscoring the
Buckeyes 20-1 over the weekend.

But Glines grounded into a

disbelief. Sophomore shortstop
Travis Maezes stared into
the dugout. Sophomore third
baseman Jacob Cronenworth
squatted, looking down into the
turf. Freshman catcher Harrison
Wenson had his hand on his hips,
staring up in the sky. They all
knew the opportunity was there,
but nothing came of it.

A day after tallying 11 hits,
Michigan couldn't find enough
offense on Sunday, losing to
Minnesota, 3-1.
Michigan (4-5 Big Ten, 14-17-1
overall) started the day's scoring
when junior first baseman Kyle
Jusick led off the second inning
with a double to right-center
field and scored on freshman
left fielder Carmen Benedetti's
sacrifice fly.
Minnesota (5-4, 17-10)
responded in odd fashion.
With two outs in the third
inning, junior left-hander Trent
Szkutnik struck out Dan Mott,
but a dropped third strike and a
throwing error by Wenson left
Motl in scoring position. He
scored on the next play.
It appeared that Wenson
initially tagged Motl, as he
reacted oddly to the umpires'
no call on what appeared to be a
routine dropped third strike.
"I didn't have a great view, but
I was justgoing off of (Wenson's)
reaction," said Michigan coach
Erik Bakich. "I think Harrison
probably got him.

"We've just got to learn fromit.
We've got to be tough enough to
where we can overcome that and
not exacerbate the situation and
give a two-out hit."
The Golden Gophers took their
momentum to the fourth inning,
scoring two runs off a ground-
rule double and an RBI single.
Aside from Jusick's double,
Michigan couldn't find any timely
hitting. Minnesota forced four
1-2-3 innings and the Wolverines
failed to provide any run support.
Szkutnik entered the game
0-3, a meager record at face
value. But it certainly isn't
representative of how dominant
he has pitched. With eight MLB
scouts watching his outing, the
junior threw six innings on
Sunday, allowing just two earned
runs while punching out five.
"(Szkutnik) gave us a chance
to win, and we didn't get it done
behind him," Bakich said.
Perhaps the most impressive
part of Szkutnik's day was not
succumbing to the pressure of
scouts.

nervous)," Szkutnik said. "But
you've got to analyze yourself.
Thinking about that - will that
help you win? The team win? It
doesn't."
Minnesota's strong defense,
though, proved to be too much
to overcome, despite Szkutnik's
performance. In the fifth inning,
senior catcher Cole Martin was
thrown out by the right fielder
attempting to take third on a
Benedetti single.
Michigan showed glimpses
of being a Big Ten contender
this weekend, but it must fix
its inconsistencies if it has any
hope of making a splash in the
conference.
What happened Friday:
Cronenworth allowed three
runs in a blown save, including
one on a walk in the 11th-inning
of the Wolverines' 9-6 loss to
Minnesota.
"We dug ourselves a pretty
good hole a couple of times,"
Bakich said. "When you have
a chance to win the game, you
win the game."
The blame, though,
couldn't solely be pinned on
Cronenworth. Senior right-
hander Ben Ballantine struggled
to find any rhythm, throwing 77
pitches in three innings while
allowing four hits and a run.
Michigan gotdown early, 5-0,
but came back firing, eventually
evening the game at six to go
into extra innings.
But, once again, the bats
became anemic, and Minnesota
tallied three runs for the win.
What happened Saturday:
Michigan combined hot bats
with near-perfect pitching to
even the series with Minnesota.
The Wolverines looked
to change the weekend's
momentum, and they did just
that in an 8-1 win.
Sophomore left-hander Evan
Hill was the catalyst behind
Michigan's success, throwing
6.2 scoreless innings in
dominant fashion. He finished
the game with four strikeouts.
Freshman outfielder Jackson
Lamb gave Hill all the run
support he needed, hitting a
two-run home run to left-center
field - the first home run at Ray
Fisher Stadium this season.

PAUL SH ERMAN/Daily
Junior left-hander Trent Szkutnik pitched well Sunday afternoon, but it wasn't enough to earn Michigan a series win.
