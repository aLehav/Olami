Ibram X. Kendi — author of 

“Stamped from the Beginning,” 
the 2016 National Book Award for 
Nonfiction winner — conveyed 
to a crowd of 50 his thoughts 
on how government policy has 
perpetuated 
racist 
ideologies 

throughout U.S. history.

An 
assistant 
professor 
of 

African-American history at the 
University of Florida, Kendi has 
published work in publications 
such as The New York Times, 
The Huffington Post and Black 
Perspectives.

Kendi began his talk Tuesday 

night by stating the United States 
has experienced two narratives: 

one of racial progress and one of 
increased racism in society. He 
said understanding this duality 
can reorient how one thinks about 
racism throughout history.

“We’ve actually had a dueling 

history of race,” he said. “What 
I mean by that is we’ve had a 
history of racial progress, but 
we’ve also had a simultaneous 
progression of racism. We’ve 
actually experienced, as a nation, 
two historical forces.”

A key component of Kendi’s 

discussion was that racist ideas 
stem from policy enacted by self-
interested politicians, rather than 
the commonly assumed falsehood 
that ideas lead to policy. He 
cited historical instances where 
political parties, unhappy with 

Months after the University 

of Michigan’s release of a new 
policy on building renaming, 
the LSA History Department 
convened a bicentennial panel 
Tuesday 
afternoon 
on 
the 

potential renaming of the C.C. 
Little Building, which has been 
named after former University 
of Michigan President Clarence 
Cook “C.C.” Little since 1968. 
About 50 people attended the 
discussion on the many factors 
involved with the process of 
name-changing and examples 
of other universities’ actions in 
similar cases.

Though he was a renowned 

genetics, cancer and tobacco 
researcher, Little has recently 
come under fire for his support 
of policies such as compulsory 
sterilization 
of 
the 
“unfit” 

and immigration restriction. 
American 
Culture 
Prof. 

Alexandra Minna Stern opened 
the panel by reflecting on the 
nuances of building names.

“We’re going to think about 

the arguments for removing 
his name and what are some of 
the arguments for retaining his 
name,” she said. “There is a high 
bar for renaming. If we just take 
his name off the building, we 
erase the past.”

Panelists 
referenced 
the 

notion that Little’s associations 
with ideas and practices are 
antagonistic 
to 
the 
values 

of 
diversity, 
inclusion 
and 

nondiscrimination 
the 

University is pushing toward 
today.

Stern 
said 
one 
line 
of 

reasoning 
for 
preserving 

Little’s name is that the name 
causes little harm, as not many 
students know who he was or 

what he did.

LSA junior Joshua Hasler 

countered those reasons by 
arguing Little’s interests in 
eugenics cannot be separated 
from his tenure as University 
president. He found it hard to 
believe Little became president 

of 
the 
American 
Eugenics 

Society 
after 
leaving 
the 

University in 1929.

“Like many students here at 

the University, I’ve had a class 
in the C.C. Little building,” 
Hasler said. After discovering 

The engineering and medical 

fields 
came 
together 
when 

five 
University 
of 
Michigan 

undergraduates teamed up to 
contribute to modern medicine 
with a device that can give the 
same data as a $30,000 machine 
in one-fifth of the time.

Sanguis 
Diagnostics, 

also called Team 805, is a 
group of students who have 
developed the product HeRM — 
hemoretractometer — a device 
that can measure a patient’s pre-
treatment hemostasis, or natural 
blood-clotting abilities.

Recent prototype development 

by these students has recognized 
current demand for a low-cost, 
fast-paced, 
technologically 

savvy and informative device for 
diagnostic blood testing.

The 
ability 
to 
maintain 

hemostasis is crucial for normal 
life function, as clotting too much 
or not enough could have serious 
implications 
for 
a 
patient’s 

health. The device, however, 
could be used for providing 
high-tech medical care to those 
who do not have access to it,

University of Michigan students 

and 
faculty 
gathered 
Tuesday 

evening in the Michigan Union to 
discuss President Donald Trump’s 
first 100 days in office for the annual 
Jack L. Walker Conference, hosted 

by the Undergraduate Political 
Science Association and sponsored 
by the Political Science Department.

The conference, named after 

Jack L. Walker, the late University 
professor 
of 
political 
science, 

explores different topics in politics 
every winter semester with experts 
and professionals in government and 
academia.

This year’s conference featured 

five professors specializing in a wide 
range of political science subfields, 
including feminist political theory, 
international trade and the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

LSA sophomore Eve Hillman, 

a co-president of UPSA, explained 
holding panels like these allow 
students to interact with professors 

in a way they rarely have an 
opportunity to in class.

“UPSA really focuses on building 

a relationship between political

so many of the political science 
classes are really big,” Hillman said. 
“So if you can get events and get

Chairs used in last week’s 

notable Stumbling Blocks exhibit on 

affirmative action will not be put to 

such symbolic use much longer. The 

University of Michigan Property 

Disposition Department announced 

Monday on Facebook that the 

University is currently selling the 

chairs to the public for $10 each.

The pop-up exhibit served as 

reminder of Proposal 2, the 2006 

constitutional amendment that 

banned on race- and gender-based 

affirmative action in the state, 

which the Supreme Court upheld 

in 2014. The 950 empty maize and 

blue chairs arranged on the Diag 

served to personify the number of 

underrepresented minority students 

who were unable to attend the 

University following the ban.

Presidential Bicentennial Prof. 

Martha Jones, who led the exhibit’s 

coordination, wrote in an email 

interview she was happy to see the 

chairs put to continued use.

“I am pleased that the chairs will 

have a life beyond the exhibition,” 

she wrote. “The rest will go out 

into the world and become part of 

other gatherings and conversations. 

Stumbling Blocks was always 

intended to be a pop-up experience, 

one that would further our best 

thinking about the future.”

Some students, however, called 

out what they perceived as irony in 

the chairs’ short-lived significance.

LSA senior David Song, a former 

Daily photographer, wrote in an 

email interview he was a bit taken 

aback by the speed of the process.

“It feels almost like a stab in the 

back to offer these “missing students 

after Proposal 2” chairs up for 

money,” he wrote. “I recognize that 

(the University) or whoever owns this 

property probably doesn’t have much 

use for it now, but the timing feels a 

little too soon.”

Special events manager Julie 

Ashley said Tuesday she hadn’t 

yet heard any student complaints. 

After offering the chairs to 

buildings and facilities managers, 

she said Property Disposition has 

been receiving marked interest in 

the chairs, which are emblazoned 

with the University’s bicentennial 

logo.

“We’ve gotten a lot of interest 

from employees for things like 

tailgates,” she said.

ON THE DAILY: STUMBLING BLOCKS BACK IN THE HOT SEAT 

BRIAN KOSASIH/Daily

Matt Ladies, the treasurer of MUSIC Matters, talks about SpringFest at the CSG Chamber 
Meeting on Tuesday. 

L A ST CSG

After 
conducting 
three 

campus-wide 
surveys 
and 

analyzing 
the 
results, 
the 

Central Student Government 
Mental 
Health 
Taskforce 

released its 2017 official report 
and comprehensive summary 
of its findings.

The 
task 
force 
was 

commissioned in November 
of 2016 by LSA senior David 
Schafer, 
then-president 
of 

CSG, and consisted of three 
co-chairs and a board of 16 
members. Two of the surveys 
the 
task 
force 
released 

measured opinions on mental 
health in regard to classroom 
climate, while one focused on 
understanding 
campus-wide 

opinions on mental health 
resources.

More than 1,000 students 

responded to the surveys. The 

task force reported a majority 
of stress- and mental health-
related 
issues 
came 
from 

academic stress, anxiety and 
depression.

The results, which include 

feedback from students and 
faculty across all schools and 
colleges at the University of 
Michigan, found that while 
students are aware of the 
mental 
health 
resources 

available to them on campus, 
not all students find the 
resources easily accessible.

In an example given by 

the research, some students 
responded 
the 
long 
wait 

time for appointments and 
the limited hours at CAPS 
contributed to their inability 
to utilize these on-campus 
resources. Students living on 
North Campus also responded 
they feel it is much more 
difficult for them to seek 
mental health assistance, as 

they do not have equal access 
to the resources on Central 
Campus.

When it came to analyzing 

input from faculty, the results 
found 
that 
while 
faculty 

did 
vary 
on 
opinion 
and 

experience, just over half of the 
faculty members responded 
they felt fully or moderately 
informed about the mental 
health resources available to 
students on campus.

One of the most conclusive 

results 
from 
the 
surveys 

found 96 percent of student 
respondents feel there is an 
importance for mental health 
to be accommodated on a 
college campus, yet 74 percent 
feel uncomfortable addressing 
their mental health concerns 
with faculty. According to 
LSA senior Yumi Taguchi, 
co-director of Active Minds 
and a co-leader of the task 
force, these were some of the 

most striking results.

“We weren’t really sure 

what we were going to 
find before we sent out 
those surveys, but two 
things we thought were 
very interesting was both 
faculty 
and 
students 

really support the idea 
that 
a 
college 
campus 

should create a supportive 
environment 
for 
mental 

illness, 
and 
also 
there 

was a striking difference 
between 
faculty 
and 

students when it came to 
comfortability when asking 
for accommodations,” she 
said. “Faculty were pretty 
comfortable handling any 
accommodation 
requests 

whereas students felt very 
uncomfortable.”

Following the results, 

the task force created 13 
recommendations it hopes 
will be established next 
year. According to Business 
junior Grace Nasr, chair 
of 
CSG’s 
Health 
and 

Safety 
Commission 
and 

Central Student Government Mental 
Health Taskforce releases report

The official report follows the conducting and analysis of three campus-wide surveys

Little’s link to eugenics, he said, 
he was shocked. “Obviously, this 
isn’t a fact the University likes to 
publicize.”

Following the recent pop-up 

Stumbling Blocks installations 
on campus, Hasler said he was 
surprised not to see anything 
addressing 
Little 
during 
the 

bicentennial exhibit.

“We didn’t see anything at 

the C.C. Little building,” Hasler 
said. “Even when students do 
hear about C.C. Little’s eugenics 
past, I feel that sometimes we fail 
to grasp the gravity of it. Every 
University does have a building 
like this, but that doesn’t mean 
we should keep these buildings. 
A mainstream thought nearly 
a century ago doesn’t reflect 
the values that we hold at this 
University today.”

Hasler said he thinks that as 

president, Little might have been 
able to distribute information 
on 
eugenics 
to 
students 
as 

mainstream 
science. 
The 

University, he said, should work 
to remove references to him from 
campus.

“As we think about, as students 

and faculty members, how we 
relate to this building, we need 
to ask ourselves: Regardless of 
the faculty who reside in this 
building, is C.C. Little a president 
whose 
legacy 
— 
specifically 

relating to what he did for the 
University of Michigan during 
his tenure — is something that we 
want to institutionalize?” Hasler 
said.

History Prof. Martin S. Pernick 

spoke in defense of Little’s views, 
as well as his role as a leading 
researcher of the time.

“Many of his views were widely 

shared by other scientists,” he 
said. “He was a leader in a vast 
number of important national 
and international organizations, 
and he had a flare for publicity 
for language and promotion that 
helped shape public attention.”

Despite 
this, 
Pernick 
said 

many of his studies were intended 
to create doubt, saying out-of-
the-box things such as smoking 
and climate change were both 
“harmless.” 

“Little focused on genetics,” 

Pernick said. “He seemed to 
revise his views to fit the tobacco 
industry’s views.”

Pernick stressed a building 

renaming cannot simply erase 
Little’s legacy.

“The point is that removing his 

name from a building, whether 
we do it or not, should not result 
in erasing him from memory 
or forgetting the important but 
complex things we can learn from 
understanding the connections 
among his multiple activities,” he 
said.

History 
Prof. 
Matthew 

Countryman 
placed 
building 

renamings in a historical context, 
citing the significance of Yale 
University renaming John C. 

Calhoun College to the Grace 
Murray Hopper College instead.

“Naming itself is a political act 

or an institutional act that should 
be 
examined 
and 
evaluated 

like any other historical event,” 
Countryman said. “What does 
the act of naming reveal about 
the political, social and cultural 
terrain in which it occurred?”

Countryman 
supported 

a 
balance 
in 
assessing 
the 

accomplishments of the figures in 
question before deciding whether 
to keep their names.

“Weighing of the fullness of 

the historical figure’s acts seems 
to be a more appropriate way,” 
Countryman said.

Prof. Kumea Shorter-Gooden, 

visiting from the University of 
Maryland, spoke about renaming 
the football stadium on her 
campus after student protests in 
2015. The stadium was originally 
named after former Maryland 
President Curley Byrd, who, 
despite bringing the university to 
national prominence, espoused 
racist 
views 
and 
actively 

prevented Black students from 
attending the school.

“The symbolic act of removing 

President Byrd’s name would 
continue the university’s work 
to make the campus a more 
diverse, inclusive, fair, just and 
welcoming 
place,” 
Shorter-

Gooden said. “For many African-
American citizens of the state of 
Maryland, alumni, faculty, staff 
and students of the University, 
Byrd’s name is associated with 
a 
history 
of 
exclusion 
and 

discrimination. Maintaining the 
name contributes to a hostile and 
unwelcoming climate.”

Shorter-Gooden 
also 

addressed some of the arguments 
against 
removing 
his 
name, 

such 
as 
disregarding 
Byrd’s 

positive contributions to the 
university, 
not 
focusing 
on 

actual policy to create a more 
inclusive 
environment 
and 

setting a precedent to reconsider 
everything on campus with an 
eponym. 

“The university risks losing 

alumni, donors and political 
support,” Shorter-Gooden said. 
“But 
since 
President 
Byrd’s 

time, the university has been 
transformed from a segregated 
university into one of the most 
diverse universities in the nation. 
I myself was delighted that the 
name was changed.”

Overall, Shorter-Gooden said, 

allowing Black students into 
universities is important, but 
making sure those students feel 
welcomed once they arrive is even 
more crucial. By changing the 
name of the C.C. Little Building, 
she thinks the University can 
make progress on that front.

“To name a building after 

Little, without any contending 
around his eugenicist past at the 
same moment that you’re opening 
up doors just tells us how this 
issue, how the whole agenda of 
diversity, was in its infancy and 
how much we have evolved,” 
Shorter-Gooden said. “We still 
have a ways to go.”

reducing workload and patient 
overload in hospitals and saving 
time in emergency situations 
following mismanagement of 
medications, much more so than 
what is currently available in the 
medical field.

The team, spearheaded by 

Engineering senior David Peyer, 
the leader of the group who 
conducted all the preliminary 
research for the product, worked 
to create a user interface around 
an important medical procedure 
— something that could prove 
significant for both health care 
professionals and patients.

Peyer first began his research 

in the University’s Mechanical 
Engineering 
Department 

with Jianping Fu, an associate 
professor 
of 
mechanical 

engineering, performing clinical 
trials on the technique.

Peyer has since collaborated 

with Kevin Ward, the director 
of the Michigan Center for 
Integrative Research in Critical 
Care, in securing blood samples 
from the University of Michigan 
Hospital. Later, after enrolling in 
the Applied Liberal Arts course 
261, Social Science Topics in ALA 
— a course geared toward those 

minoring in entrepreneurship — 
taught by Eric Fretz, a lecturer of 
psychology and education, Peyer 
and his group members were 
able to explore the potential for 
the device even further.

Within the group are two 

subgroups: The first, centered 
around the business endeavors 
of the project, includes Business 
juniors Ajay Das and Jeet 
Shah. The second, focused on 
the physical development and 
implementation of the project, 
is led by Peyer and Engineering 
sophomore Kyle Fietsam and 
LSA sophomore Antonio Mika, 
who designed the encasement 
of the device, completed the 
circuit designs, and integrated 
subsystems and software design, 
respectively.

Das 
noted 
the 
business 

endeavor of the project aimed 
to challenge the device’s central 
competitors, specifically Roche 
Diagnostics, Alere, Abbott and 
Siemens.

“Our role was to more analyze 

the competitive vantage of the 
device, see how that plays a role 
with the major competitors in 
the blood coagulation market,” 
Das said. “What we’ve been 
doing this past semester is 
analyzing major competitors, 
what their products provide, 
how 
this 
device 
actually 

undercuts that and what the cost 

savings are that it could provide 
to potentially hospitals and 
other consumers.”

The devices of the central 

competitors 
cost 
thousands 

of dollars, Das said, and their 
tests take nearly an hour to 
complete. This is only if a 
hospital is equipped with the 
testing device. For many, the 
data have to be sent elsewhere, 
delaying the turnaround time 
even further. For the Sanguis 
Diagnostics prototype, however, 
the device costs less than $200 
to produce and takes between 
five and 15 minutes to complete 
the same data measurement.

Additionally, 
while 
the 

competitors’ devices are large 
machines — costing as much 
as 
$30,000 
—the 
Sanguis 

Diagnostics 
prototype 
is 

portable, simple to use and 
does not require a trained 
technician to run the diagnostic; 
instead, those already present 
at the hospital would be able to 
determine the correct medical 
treatment based on the device’s 
results in real time.

Peyer 
explained 
the 

functionality of the device: the 
user places a droplet of blood 
on a cartridge — a portion of 
the device only costing a matter 
of cents — and as the blood 
coagulates, it contracts, pulling 
a beam on the device downward. 

An electrical current is run 
across the beam; as the beam 
deflects, the resistance goes up, 
allowing the user to measure the 
resistance.

Jeet talked about the potential 

of the device when scaled to a 
global picture.

“A unique device like this has 

many different applications for 
emergency 
rooms, 
hospitals, 

NGOs, Doctors Without Borders 
and even the military,” Jeet said. 
“So right now, we’re going to 
get into analyzing the different 
avenues for this device.”

The team also discussed the 

device’s significance with regard 
to preventing doctor error — 
a study from Johns Hopkins 
Medicine 
recently 
reported 

errors take the third leading 
cause of death in the United 
States, 
causing 
more 
than 

250,000 deaths per year.

The 
team 
has 
received 

interest from Roche, a central 
competitor; however, following 
graduation, Peyer will focus 
on creating a company in Ann 
Arbor around the product while 
working with the others in 
between their academics. Peyer 
will also continue to maintain 
clinical testing with the hospital. 

“The purpose of this machine … 

is to give doctors more information, 
faster so that they can make better 
decisions,” Peyer said.

at the University of Washington. 
Wasser has used the DNA in the 
feces of the African elephant from 
around Africa to map out the places 
of origin of recovered elephant 
tusks. Through discovering where 
the tusks originated, Wasser can 
identify where poaching is taking 
place most frequently.

“It used to be thought that for 

these really big seizures of ivory 
… that poachers were assembling 
ivory from all over Africa,” Kolbert 
said. “But (Wasser) has shown 
that there are just two poaching 
hotspots: one is at the border of 
Gabon, Congo and Cameroon … 
and one is southern Tanzania and 
northern Mozambique.”

Rackham 
student 
Alex 

Truelove said he finds great 

importance, especially as a student 
in the School of Natural Resources 
and Environment, in combatting 
species’ extinction.

“I think everything that she 

talked about, whether it’s the 
species extinction, and things that 
also might affect humans as well 
(was important),” Truelove said. 
“I think our future depends very 
much on the actions we take in 
regards to these problems.”

As Kolbert continued, she told 

the story of the American chestnut 
tree in the United States, once a 
common tree, especially on the 
East Coast. The work of William 
Powell of the American Chestnut 
Research and Restoration Project 
at the State University of New 
York has genetically modified the 
American chestnut tree to make 
it resistant to a disease that nearly 
wiped the species out beginning at 
the turn of the 20th century.

“In principle, at least, this is 

quite at least an amazing result,” 
Kolbert said. “A fungus that 
humans brought to the U.S. wiped 
out the chestnut and now a very 
clever human has figured out a 
way to try to revive the chestnut.”

Rackham student Chris Askew-

Merwin emphasized how humans 
ultimately are worse off when they 
kill off more species. Especially 
in the Amazon rainforest, he 
said, humans lose thousands of 
potential medicines when they kill 
plants they have never discovered.

“I personally believe that all 

these animal species have a right to 
exist and we should do our best to 
make sure they continue to do so,” 
Askew-Merwin. “At the same time, 
but also appeal to everyone’s self-
interest because we are better off 
and healthier with biodiversity.” 

A number of non-native species 

have been introduced to New 
Zealand starting 500 years ago, 
Kolbert said. One of the first, 

the Pacific rat, nearly killed off 
numerous flightless birds native to 
New Zealand.

Rabbits were later introduced 

to New Zealand, and exploded 
in number, which took a toll on 
farms on the islands. To combat 
the rabbit population, stoats, a 
type of weasel, were introduced. 
The 
stoat 
furthered 
the 

population decline of birds on 
the island instead of the rabbits, 
leading native New Zealanders 
to attempt to eradicate the 
presence of all the non-native 
mammals on the island.

“So 
New 
Zealanders 
are 

passionate about their native 
birds … and they have taken 
it upon themselves to protect 
them and since the problem is at 
least the mammals, the answer 
they have come up with is to 
killing a lot of the mammals,” 
Kolbert said. “It has successfully 
de-ratted a number of islands.”

election results, have suppressed 
voters — a process that resulted in 
modern-day voter ID laws.

“They 
did 
what 
previous 

groups of people did, when they 
did not have the votes,” Kendi 
said. “They figured out new ways 
to suppress the votes of their 
opinions. They figured out how 
to birth the great-grandchildren 
of poll taxes, grandfather clauses 
and literacy taxes. And these great-
grandchildren were of course, 
voter ID laws.”

Kendi also discussed different 

forms of racist ideas and how 
they contribute to modern-day 
discussions of social justice issues. 
The Blue Lives Matter group, he 
said, uses the idea that Black people 

are inherently inferior to white 
people in its arguments.

“We saw this play out in this 

race and policing debate, Blue 
Lives Matter principally blamed 
who? Black people,” Kendi said. 
“Black women are a racial group, 
Black gays are a racial group, the 
Black poor are a racial group. Black 
people have multiple identities, 
and throughout American history, 
each and every one of the groups 
they’ve been a part of has been 
denigrated as inferior by people in 
other groups.”

Kendi’s 
analysis 
of 

intersectionality and the different 
ways racist ideas affect different 
groups impressed students. 

Moses Massenburg, a graduate 

student 
at 
Michigan 
State 

University, said he enjoyed the 
discussion of intersectionality and 
how racist ideas can interact with 

other systems of oppression such 
as gender or class. He also touched 
on the importance of educating 
communities in order to stop the 
spread of racist ideas.

“I appreciate his discussion 

of how racist ideas can cross 
between 
other 
systems 

of 
oppressions, 
be 
they 

class or sexism, and all the 
intersections,” Massenburg said. 
“I think educating and learning 
at the same time and going into 
places where people don’t get 
access to education is important, 
so prisons, going into elderly care 
homes, and going into different 
neighborhoods.”

Kendi concluded by urging 

audience 
members 
to 
fight 

against racist policies to halt 
the progression of racist ideas 
in U.S. society. He praised social 
movements as a harbinger of 

change, and emphasized the 
importance of believing in the 
work.

“If you really want to eliminate 

the ideas, you must eliminate the 
cradle, the policies,” he said. “It’s 
social movements that have lead 
the change. But we have to believe 
that change is possible, in order 
to engage in that kind of rigorous, 
and taxing, and difficult work of 
organizing and challenging power.

MSU student Jasmine Howard 

said she first heard about the talk 
on Facebook and appreciated 
Kendi’s 
explanation 
of 
the 

connection between how racist 
ideas 
and 
policies 
influence 

society.

“(It was) not surprising, but I 

enjoyed him going through the 
process of racist ideas and how 
they become policy and how they 
influence society,” she said.

a co-leader of the task force, 
the recommendations will be 
sent 
to 
administrators 
and 

stakeholders on campus.

Of these recommendations, 

there are five the task force feels 
can be implemented within one 
year, including implementing 
a Wellness Zone on North 
Campus. Six recommendations 
can be accomplished within 
one to three years, such as 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 

CAPS counselors. Two could 
possibly be accomplished in 
three or more years, such as 
establishing faculty training 
on mental health issues among 
students.

The task force will continue 

its work next year to further 
establish these policies.

“The goal of the task force 

next year will be to help 
implement the program and 
policy 
recommendations 

that 
are 
improved 
by 

administrators,” Nasr said.

Throughout the year, the 

task force also held two mental 
health town halls, one on 
Central Campus and one on 
North Campus.

The purpose of these town 

halls, which were open to the 
entire University community, 
was to share the survey results 

as well as gather information 
from 
audience 
members 

regarding 
their 
thoughts 

on 
the 
results 
and 
their 

recommendations for potential 
programs and policies.

While 
the 
task 
force 

acknowledges the University 
is 
privileged 
to 
have 
the 

resources it does to address 
mental health, it hopes its 
work will help to make these 
resources 
accessible 
for 

everyone on campus in order to 
ensure adequate mental health 
remains a priority for students, 
faculty and administrators.

“We 
never 
want 
mental 

health to become something 
that goes in the back burner,” 
Taguchi said. “Mental health 
is always something that is 
important, 
everyone 
will 

always have it and it will affect 
their experiences here as a 
student, as a faculty member, a 
professor.”

LSA freshman Matt Henning 

said he feels publishing these 
results is a good first step in 
addressing mental health on 
campus, and he hopes the 
University will continue to 
improve upon its resources.

“If these numbers and these 

facts don’t get published and 
don’t get out, then these problems 
will still happen, but we just 
won’t know about them,” he said. 
“Putting the data out there, I 
think, is the first step to actually 
making any sort of change.”

they’re smaller like this, you can 
have more personal interaction 
and you can get your really salient 
questions about current events 
answered.”

When asked about Trump’s 

foreign policy mishaps, Noah 
Nathan, an assistant professor of 
political science, said she believes 
Trump’s team is directionless 
because of its inexperience and an 
ideological split between White 
House 
Chief 
Strategist 
Steve 

Bannon, who is known for his 
white nationalist views, and more 
mainstream officials.

“It’s not clear that there is 

a foreign policy apparatus of 
bureaucrats, of senior officials 
from the State Department … who 
are planning out what the foreign 
policy strategy is,” Nathan said. “I 
think (the administration is) just 
going from crisis to crisis to news 
event to news event figuring out a 
plan.”

In a question about who will 

suffer the most under the Trump 

administration, 
Lisa 
Disch, 
a 

professor of political science and 
women’s studies, answered women, 
particularly 
the 
elderly, 
will 

bear the burden of higher health 
care costs should a Republican 
replacement to the Affordable Care 
Act pass the House and Senate.

“It’s a return to the 1920s, when 

there were many elderly women 
living in poverty,” Disch said. “We 
didn’t think that was humane so 
that’s why we enacted policies that 
would help them.”

Recent events were also of high 

interest. Mark Tessler, the Samuel 
J. Eldersveld Collegiate Professor 
of Political Science, responded to a 
question about last week’s missile 
attack on Syria by stating that 
though Trump likely did not have a 
coherent plan when he ordered the 
strike, it worked favorably for the 
president’s ratings by deflecting 
attention away from the ongoing 
investigation into his presidential 
campaign’s 
ties 
with 
Russian 

officials and showing he can do 
something his predecessor Barack 
Obama could not do.

“He gained some popularity,” 

Tessler said. “I hate myself for 
saying this, but he looked at least 

somewhat presidential in terms of 
taking action and standing up for 
people who are victims and got 
some credit for that.”

Ken Kollman, the Frederick G. 

L. Huetwell Professor of Political 
Science, compared his projection 
about Trump’s future to other 
world leaders’ fates — Charles 
de Gaulle, Silvio Berlusconi, 
Richard 
Nixon 
and 
Benito 

Mussolini 
— 
saying 
Trump 

can turn into any one of these 
leaders.

“I’m hoping for some blend of, 

just for the sake of us all, some 
blend of Berlusconi and Charles 
de Gaulle,” Kollman said.

When asked what the media 

can do to regain its credibility 
among 
those 
who 
distrust 

them, James Morrow, the A.F.K. 
Organski Professor of World 
Politics, said while the right 
disliking mainstream media is 
not a new phenomenon, media 
needs to cultivate a self-critical 
attitude, telling a story of how 
The New York Times “went nuts” 
about the Trump administration 
after the election.

“One thing I would like to see 

is for them to think about how 

is it that such a large portion 
of the American electorate has 
gotten to the point where they 
basically don’t believe anything 
(the media) say,” Morrow said. 
“It predates the internet, so it’s 
not just a recent phenomenon.”

LSA freshman Caitlin Brown 

said she was intrigued by hearing 
a variety of perspectives from 
the professors.

“I 
thought 
it 
was 
super 

informational,” 
Brown 
said. 

“I felt already pretty educated 
about what was going on and 
then I came here and I was like 
‘Wow, there is so much I didn’t 
know.’”

When 
asked 
what 
mark 

Trump would make in U.S. 
history, Disch said she preferred 
he leaves no mark because any 
mark would not be a good one. 
She warned that in the worst-
case 
scenario, 
Trump 
will 

change the course of history like 
how George W. Bush redefined 
war through his actions after the 
Sept. 11 attacks.

“I would love it if history 

doesn’t remember him; I would 
love it if they remembered Alec 
Baldwin,” she said.

F

or 
the 
past 
three 

and a half years, I’ve 
fought fiercely against 

being 
titled 
a 
“Michigan 

Engineer.” 
I 
rejected 
this 

title because to me it seemed 
like the Michigan Engineer 
represented so many of my 
negative 
experiences 
amid 

engineering culture: having to 
prove to my male teammates 
that I’m just as capable as 
them, students and faculty 
alike not understanding how 
our decisions as engineers 
affect 
real 
people’s 
lives, 

and 
fighting 
against 
the 

administration to accept my 
work in disability design and 
design research.

I remember so vividly the 

day sophomore year that I 
walked into the machine shop 
for the first time to complete a 
training project. I was sweating 
and my hands were shaky. I 
tracked down one of the guys 
in flannel shirts who looked 
like he might be in charge and 
told him why I was there. I 
told him I had never been in a 
machine shop before and had 
absolutely no experience with 
making things. He walked me 
over to a big scary lathe and 
told me the project was easy — 
don’t worry. I asked him how I 
should start. He shot his wide 
eyes at me and said: “Didn’t 
you watch the instructional 
videos? 
You 
really 
should 

come here prepared.” Then he 
walked away.

What that man didn’t know 

was I had actually watched 
every single video they gave 
us about three times each. I 
memorized 
everything, 
but 

it’s 
different 
when 
you’re 

standing in front of a giant, 
scary machine for the first 
time. I didn’t know what to do. 
I apparently wasn’t allowed 
to ask for help. But I couldn’t 
just stand there, look at all the 
knobs and levers, and hope to 
magically become enlightened 
either. So I left. I returned my 
tools, got back my Mcard and 
walked out the door.

I thought it was my fault, 

that I wasn’t good enough to 
be an engineer. I had never felt 
so stupid in my whole life. I sat 
on a bench outside the EECS 
building and called my dad 
right then, crying progressively 
harder the further I got into 
recounting my story.

This memory and the way 

I felt that day will forever 
be burned into my mind. 
Unfortunately, it’s not the only 
negative experience I had in 
engineering, and I’m not the 
only person to have felt that 
they weren’t good enough to 

be an engineer. To me at that 
time, identifying as a Michigan 
Engineer meant being close-
minded, 
condescending, 

exclusionary of women and 
minorities, unwilling to ask for 
or give help, and too proud to 
admit mistakes.

So why did I stay in this 

program? It’s a question almost 
everyone asks me and one that 
I’ve asked myself every day for 
the past three years. I realized 
recently that it’s because of 
those whose energy and action 
contradict the negative, but 
often 
accurate, 
stereotype 

of 
a 
Michigan 
Engineer. 

Despite my experience in the 
machine shop, my design team 
that semester was incredibly 
supportive, and we were able 
to bring out one another’s 
strengths in ways I never 
imagined.

That same year, I began a 

disability design company with 
Sidney Krandall, a University 
alum in the School of Art & 
Design class of 2016, and we 
were able to rely on individual 
faculty to sit down with us and 
give feedback on cardboard-
and-duct-tape 
prototypes. 

I discovered people whose 
offices I could stop by and 
pose big questions to about 
carving my own path through 
the College of Engineering. 
Shanna 
Daly, 
an 
assistant 

professor 
of 
mechanical 

engineering, became one of 
my closest mentors in this 
way. She helped me discover 
the exponential growth that 
occurs when design research 
aligns with design practice, 
and introduced me to a world 
of opportunities, including a 
trip to Copenhagen to present 
our research.

Amy Hortop, a coordinator 

of 
mechanical 
engineering 

capstone 
projects, 
became 

my partner in creating an 
Interdisciplinary 
Design 

Conference. This introduced 

me to an entire group of 
engineers, 
architects 
and 

designers who care just as 
much as I do about doing 
impactful work. And finally, 
my capstone design project 
team — Val Coldren, Ryan 
Payerle and Sheevam Naik — 
has been a source of unending 
creative energy as we navigate 
our way through an intense 
case study in disability design.

A couple of months ago, I 

realized I’m graduating this 
spring with a degree from the 
University of Michigan College 
of Engineering. So by definition, 
I am a Michigan Engineer. What 
does that mean?

I 
am 
a 
designer. 
I’m 

passionate 
about 
designing 

with and learning from people 
who 
have 
disabilities. 
I’m 

insistent 
that 
every 
single 

person has the opportunity to 
create a positive impact in the 
world, and I try to open people’s 
eyes to that opportunity. I care 
about being reflective and 
constantly question whether or 
not I’m a good person.

Some days, when the answer 

is no, it’s up to me to figure out 
why and put the right work in. 
After seeing so much negativity 
in the world this year, I decided 
to ensure every action I take 
is one that positively impacts 
society. Choosing to live my 
life this way has given me both 
direction and wind in the sails 
of my boat of life.

So 
what 
do 
you 
offer? 

What is a Michigan Engineer 
to you? I think now is our 
opportunity to define that the 
Michigan 
Engineer 
doesn’t 

just take one form, that we 
require it to be a fluid term. 
I’ve experienced a College of 
Engineering that is diverse in 
thought and passion. Where 
each student brings unique 
strengths and individuality to 
the table. Writing “University 
of Michigan” on a résumé 
no longer implies a certain 
personality or skillset.

Each one of us has carved 

our own paths through this 
university and every day my 
fellow students define what 
it means to be a Michigan 
Engineer. The weight is on 
our shoulders to create our 
own definition and to ensure 
that our legacy is one we 
can be proud of. Our shared 
background 
as 
Michigan 

Engineers 
is 
the 
platform 

from which we take our big 
jump with eyes wide open into 
creating the world in which 
we want to live.

W

hen I watch the 
tour groups circle 
campus, 
I 
both 

smile and cringe as I see 
the 
prospective 

freshmen 
coming 

to the University of 
Michigan. I smile 
because 
college 

tours are exciting 
— they are full of 
promise and dreams 
of what is to come. 
But I cringe because, 
for 
many, 
college 

tours are also the 
beginning of a time 
in which students will first 
encounter the realization that 
they know basically nothing 
about the world.

I put myself in their shoes 

and it is hard to believe who 
I was a year ago. So much has 
happened since then, and as 
my first year at the University 
comes to a close, I realize I 
have learned a plethora of new 
things and yet still seem to 
have learned very little of the 
world outside my education. I 
am not sure if this is because 
it is my first year or because so 
much of the next three years 
is still unknown, but I have 
never been more aware of the 
knowledge I do not have.

I 
have 
had 
some 
hard 

lessons because of this lack 
of knowledge throughout the 
year. Whether it has been in 
what classes to take, what to 
major in or any kind of sizable 
life decision, more often than 
not, I usually learn from the 
mistakes I have made and not 
the things I did right. And 
this makes me wonder if I 
can successfully graduate and 
enter the “real” world with all 
of the skills I could ever need.

This extends to my friends 

and acquaintances as well. 
They have expressed these 
same thoughts, and it has lead 

me to believe that we, as a 
generation, still do not know 
very much. Collectively, our 
knowledge may be great, but 

I do not see how 
we can confidently 
leave college behind 
without 
admitting 

that we are not done 
learning.

Depending 
on 

what 
source 
you 

consult, the oldest 
millennials 
are 

currently 
entering 

their 
mid-thirties 

right 
now. 
This 

means many have settled, or 
are beginning to settle, down 
to have families, and they are 
just now starting to find jobs 
they could possibly stay in for 
more than five years. When 
looking at the big picture, we 
can see there are so many other 
people with more experience 
to draw on that we are still 
basically children within the 
world and young adults at best.

Millennials 
need 
to 
see 

that although some of us may 
disagree with certain values of 
older generations, we are not 
all-knowing or better because 
of our youth. There is value 
in talking about life lessons 
with those older than us even 
when we do not see eye to 
eye on specific issues, and we 
cannot begin to take major 
positions within this country, 
as politicians, business leaders 
or even as active citizens, 
without recognizing we have a 
lot to learn.

We must accept that our 

viewpoints and beliefs are not 
the same as others’, and it does 
not do any good to ignore what 
individuals from the opposing 
side 
have 
to 
say 
because 

we believe our way is right. 
Learning how to be a member 
of society does not just include 
contributing 
our 
opinions 

to the discussion. It means 
actively listening to others, 
being open to new ideas and 
not being afraid to change the 
way we are living based on an 
idea that was not our own.

Yes, the world is much 

different from when older 
generations were our age, but 
there are fundamental truths 
about life that we will wrestle 
with through our entire lives. 
As young adults, we have yet to 
feel the pressure to understand 
many of these, and simply 
because we have not wrestled 
with certain problems does 
not mean we can blow them 
off and not accept the advice 
we are given.

This goes beyond calling 

up our parents when we are 
having a bad day and need a 
pep talk. It means actually 
listening to what they have to 
say, what our grandparents 
have 
to 
say, 
our 
bosses, 

advisers and anyone else who 
offers us their input. I am 
not claiming everyone older 
than 
us 
automatically 
has 

something useful to tell us, 
but we should at least actively 
listen when they feel the need 
to express their thoughts.

Ultimately, even though we 

learn a lot during college, 
we cannot logically believe 
that we are done learning 
at graduation. Life itself is 
perpetually being a freshman 
and 
we 
cannot 
make 

decisions assuming we know 
everything. Because of this, 
we must remember to reflect 
not just on our choices, but 
the choices of those older 
than us. The world is made 
better 
not 
by 
citing 
the 

wrongs of those before us, but 
changing our actions so we do 
not repeat the same mistakes.

Redefining “Michigan Engineer”

LAURA MURPHY | OP-ED

Laura Murphy is a senior in the 

College of Engineering.

amegdano@umich.edu.

“Y

ou write for the 
Daily, 
so 
you 

want to go into 

journalism, right?” is a question 
I am often asked. 
And the answer is no 
… well … kind of. The 
answer is that I don’t 
even 
know. 
What 

I do know is that I 
enjoy the Daily, and 
it is something I am 
passionate about.

When I was little, 

I wanted to be an 
actress. 
Growing 

up, I was actively 
involved in theater, dance and 
public speaking competitions. 
It was my favorite thing to do. 
I loved having an audience and 
jumped at any opportunity 
to 
showcase 
my 
skills. 

However, 
my 
passion 
for 

performing never stopped me 
from pursuing other things. 
I played sports, danced and 
wrote for the school paper — 
shocker, I know.

The 
experiences 
I 
had 

outside of my primary passion 
for 
performing 
helped 
me 

to recognize how my acting 
abilities affected my other 
interests. In class, I was never 
afraid to be the first person 
to present a project, and I 
always raised my hand if I had 
a question. I did not know my 
willingness to perform in front 
of people helped me to be more 
comfortable 
and 
confident 

with myself.

When I came to college, I 

stopped performing. I became 
engaged 
with 
activities 

that were more specific to 
my academic interests, and 
the 
competitive 
nature 
of 

auditioning intimidated me. I 
am aware that even though I 
am not participating in theater 
anymore, that does not mean 
the skills and lessons I have 
learned through performing do 

not impact my day-to-day life.

The little girl inside of me 

still reminds me of the joy 
performing brought me. But 

now 
that 
I 
have 

been away from the 
stage, I have realized 
all the skills it has 
taught me beyond 
memorizing a script.

As we get older, 

our passions evolve 
and change to fit 
our individual goals. 
These 
goals 
are 

often 
focused 
on 

sustaining a lifestyle 

that best meets our needs. 
However, as our focus on these 
professional goals intensifies, 
the 
valuable 
experiences 

we might find outside of our 
vocation wane. If we only 
immerse 
ourselves 
in 
one 

environment, we are at risk of 
our passion burning out. 

As students, we often are 

caught up in thinking about 
how to get ahead of our peers 
by obtaining a better internship 
or scoring higher on a test, but 
we should acknowledge the 
fact that the experiences we 
enjoy outside of academics 
shape who we are. At this 
transitional period of our lives, 
we should be open-minded 
to new things and know that 
we aren’t wasting our time. 
Having and pursuing a variety 
of interests makes us more than 
our résumés. It is important 
to remember that being well-
rounded is a valuable virtue 
that makes us human. Just 
because 
something 
isn’t 

directly perceived as “on the 
right path” doesn’t mean it’s 
useless.

In 
fact, 
having 
hobbies 

or 
interests 
outside 
our 

professional 
disciplines 
is 

beneficial 
to 
our 
mental 

health 
and 
productivity 
in 

the professional field. When 

we focus our attention on 
our hobbies, we take time to 
de-stress from the daily grind 
of the workplace. It allows 
us to open our minds to new 
experiences and gives us a 
different activity to put forth 
our energy. At college, students 
feel pressured to be the best at 
their specific major, but taking 
classes 
that 
don’t 
exactly 

pertain to a specific interest 
encourages new forms of social 
interaction that we might not 
have if not for taking a class 
outside our disciplines.

While we might love the 

professions we are getting 
into, if we devote all of our 
energies to one thing, we risk 
neglecting the multitude of 
passions and hobbies we once 
had growing up. Achieving 
mastery at a specific profession 
depends on how we experience 
our lives outside of it. At college, 
we feel pressure to join clubs 
that pertain only to our major 
or field of interest. Instead, 
we should be encouraged 
to explore the things we’ve 
always loved alongside our 
professional goals. We should 
feel empowered to immerse 
ourselves in the multitude of 
opportunities we have on this 
campus.

When I tell my friends what 

I am involved in, they assume 
that my primary interest is 
some 
kind 
of 
journalism. 

However, they do not know 
all that I have done in my 
time before I joined the paper. 
Similarly, I am not aware of all 
of the interests that shape them. 
If we keep these passions alive 
beyond our youth, we might be 
surprised to find people who 
feel the same pressures we do. 
We might be surprised where 
we find ourselves.

Keep doing what you love

The costs and benefits of 
capturing injustice online

Whether it’s police brutality 

against 
Black 
Americans, 

unmediated violence or public 
acts of verbal and physical 
abuse, capturing and posting 
videos have become imperative 
when it comes to highlighting 
everyday 
acts 
of 
injustice. 

But what these kinds of viral 
videos portray in their content 
is almost as vital as how they 
are framed, who watches them 
and whether or not it will 
achieve its desired effect.

The most recent case of a 

viral video of injustice came 
just earlier this week when 
several 
passengers 
on 
an 

overbooked 
United 
Airlines 

flight captured something on 
their phones that has already 
caught national and online 
attention: Two aviation guards 
removed a male passenger off 
the plane by force. Based on the 
various videos of the event, the 
scene is quite disturbing. You 
can hear the collective shock 
of nearby passengers and shrill 
sound of the man’s scream, all 
while witnessing the security 
guards and the aggressive force 
in dragging the man out of his 
seat and onto the plane’s floor. 
Another video shows the man, 
his face now bloodied, running 
to the back of the plane and 
mumbling to himself: “Just kill 
me. Just kill me now. I need to 
go home.”

Since the incident occurred, 

people have expressed their 
anger 
and 
frustration 
on 

Twitter and other social media 
platforms, claiming that this 
man was unjustly taken off 
the 
plane. 
However, 
some 

online 
skeptics 
have 
tried 

to rationalize the situation, 
remarking how the man didn’t 
cooperate. It makes sense that 
people would react in both 
ways. For some, it’s a human 
instinct to empathize with 
the victim, while others might 
simply feel the need to justify 
the motive of the authority in 
question. But either way, this 
situation shouldn’t be that hard 
of an equation to solve. Even if 
the man refused to comply, the 
incident captured on camera 
is clear enough evidence that 
the way in which this man was 
taken off the plane was unruly, 

inappropriate and just plain 
wrong.

Since the beating of Rodney 

King in 1992, recording videos 
has become a powerful weapon 
in documenting injustice. With 
the universal accessibility of 
social media, these videos have 
now an even greater advantage 
of reaching audiences all over 
the world.

Camera phone videos were 

particularly influential after 
the shooting of Michael Brown, 
as they illustrated through the 
Ferguson riots, highlighted the 
issue of police brutality and 
ultimately spread the message 
of resistance in the Black Lives 
Matter movement. Since then, 
videos have become incredibly 
significant 
in 
documenting 

unjust beatings against Black 

male civilians (i.e. Eric Garner, 
Alton Sterling and Philando 
Castile). And yet even when 
a situation involving a man 
or woman being beaten is 
visually 
encapsulated 
and 

draws sympathy, a “but-what-
if-this-happened” 
rhetoric 

erupts online. The videos each 
share similar undertones for 
how authority can mistreat a 
victim. 

Despite 
how 
cellphone 

videos can bring important 
awareness to a rarely discussed 
issue, there’s something very 
problematic 
and 
somewhat 

counterproductive about the 
act. Other than not telling the 
fully story behind what is being, 
the passive act of capturing 
and posting videos of injustice 
reinforces bystander culture. 
The camera has the power 
to illustrate a misdemeanor, 
but what about the person 
capturing the event? Or the 
other people nearby witnessing 
the incident? Shouldn’t they be 

doing something? The most 
plausible theory to explain 
this passivity is because using 
a camera phone is easier and 
much safer than attempting to 
defuse the situation yourself. 
In some cases, recording for 
evidence can make a huge 
difference in how we perceive 
issues like race and criminal 
justice. But even when someone 
films an innocent man selling 
cigarettes is choked to death 
on the sidewalk, there’s still a 
probability that there won’t be 
justice for the victim.

Viral videos of injustice 

might also not be the most 
helpful tool in giving full 
context 
of 
what 
they’re 

capturing. In fact, whatever 
incident 
is 
being 
depicted 

can have drastically different 
effects on viewers, depending 
on the angle or quality of 
the camera. When we watch 
these 
videos 
online, 
they 

automatically prime to us side 
with either the authority or 
the victim, depending on our 
implicit biases. Do we side 
with the victim because we 
feel compassion for someone 
who is being hurt physically 
and emotionally? Or do we side 
with the authority because we 
hate it when a person refuses 
to respect and listen to them?

My guess is that the blame 

should lie not with the victim 
or the authority, but the power 
structures that are responsible 
for creating such a incident, 
deliberate or not. Perhaps it isn’t 
the man on the United Airlines 
we should be blaming, or even 
the security guards who carried 
out this horrifying act — what 
they did was nevertheless awful 
and should not have been as 
violent as it ended up being. 
Rather, it is the incompetence of 
United Airlines that deserves the 
most accountability. Their first 
mistake was overbooking the 
flight, but it was the company’s 
negligence of this situation and 
their mistreatment of forcibly 
removing this passenger. United 
CEO Oscar Munoz has released 
a statement, apologizing to the 
passenger and the online but 
the damage is already done. The 
repercussions will live forever 
on tape.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

‘Yeezus’ & the Bauhaus

Reflecting on industrial art and how it attests to Kanye’s artistry

When 
you 
think 
of 

Architecture, with a capital A, 
you might consider European 
cathedrals, 
gothic 
college 

campuses and maybe some all-
glass building with an all-white 
interior. 
So 
many 
Tumblr-

esque corners of the internet 
are cluttered with images of 
supremely tasteful homes and 
buildings, but almost none are 
of educational value. They just 
seem like nice spaces to be in, 
but it’s hard to understand why. 
Like music, you just know when 
you feel it.

I 
took 
an 
Architecture 

class last winter to try and 
understand 
how 
a 
space 

can impose itself on us, and 
perhaps vice-versa. Why do 
we make monuments? How do 
cities construct an identity? 
Can somewhere really be an 
empirically proven depressant, 
and how do you “fix” such a 

place?

I had most of my questions 

answered on a field trip to 
Lafayette Park: a legendary 
neighborhood 
in 
downtown 

Detroit, 
designed 
entirely 

German architect Mies Van der 
Rohe. Those who know me best 
know about my lifelong Kanye 
West fandom, so of course, 
an undertone of my field trip 
experience was in effort to 
understand West’s Yeezus-era 
obsession 
with 
mid-century 

modern architecture.

This 
is 
well-documented 

in many of West’s interviews 
and hidden easter eggs, and if 
you look in the right places, a 
strong argument could be made 
for considering Yeezus to be a 
legitimate “Bauhaus Album”. 
Specifically, 
while 
touring, 

I couldn’t help but think of 
an interview he did with Jon 
Caramanica of the New York 
Times, where he went as far as 
to cite a Le Corbusier lamp as a 
crucial “inspiration” for Yeezus.

For all of his efforts at 

building one of the greatest 
decade-spanning runs in music 
history, there’s no doubt that 
the Kanye West Experience 
has always been about more 
than the music. There is neither 
focal point nor distraction: 
Everything ranging from the 
brash interviews to the designer 
album covers contributes to a 
career-spanning performance 

art piece.

Even before the barrel of the 

media followed his every move, 
Kanye’s 
relentless 
personal 

development has always had 
architectural 
undertones. 

Before he was a Kardashian, he 
was a clumsy college dropout, 
packaging 
chipmunk-soul 

in Beaux-Arts frames. Late 
Registration shows his now-
iconic bear mascot peeking 
out from the doors of a stone 
cathedral; it should have been 
no surprise when he performed 
select tracks from the album 
with a full orchestra at Abbey 
Road Studios.

The Glow In The Dark 

Tour seemed to hyperextend 
Takashi Murakami’s vision of 
“Superflat” into a synesthetic 
cannon. A film he directed for 
Cruel Summer was projected on 
seven screens, superimposed 
on a pyramid-shaped pavilion 
designed by Dutch architect 
Rem Koolhaas. Every Kanye 
West album is an extension 
of a school of thought that 
transcends the realm of music.

Where 
Kanye 
travels 
to 

and creates his music is, in my 
opinion, the greatest indication 
of the space he intends for 
his music to occupy. He took 
a sabbatical in Rome before 
creating My Beautiful Dark 
Twisted Fantasy, dabbled in 
Japan during the Graduation 
era and made The Life of Pablo 
in Calabasas. It shows.

Yeezus, on the other hand, 

was recorded in-between a 
notoriously stark Manhattan 
loft, and an apartment in 
Paris’ 
16th 
Arrondissement. 

Now imagine Rick Rubin, and 
his beard, in either of those 
settings. Nice.

Like 
all 
Kanye 
albums, 

Yeezus is no exception in being 
a product of its environment. 
The relationship is sometimes 
hilariously direct; in the same 
interview with Caramanica, 
West revealed that he recorded 
in the living room of his Paris 
loft — which had “the worst 
acoustics possible” — and thus 
the songs “had to be super 
simple, because if you turned 
up some complicated sound 
and a track with too much bass, 
it’s not going to work in that 
space.” This is, by definition, 
engineering music for the space 
you intend for it to occupy.

The Le Corbusier citation 

for Yeezus is most interesting 
because it’s his most explicit 
architectural 
reference 
yet, 

and I find it to be worth 
considerable investigation in 
linking Yeezus to one of the 
most influential architectural 
movements and schools of all 
time: The Bauhaus.

I 
remember 
back 
when 

Yeezus first dropped, and the 
“no-album-cover” album cover 
felt like a bit of a like a lazy cop-
out. The fact that “On Sight” 
kicked the door in with a digital 
buzzsaw didn’t help; visual 
and sonic first impressions felt 
intentionally rugged.

Yet, the laziest criticism of 

post-MBDTF 
‘Ye 
capitalizes 

on these sorts of low-hanging 
fruit, spraying nonsense about 
his alleged “sloppiness” and 
“decline” since creating one of 
the most universally likeable 

albums of the century. While 
popular 
opinion 
remains 

that Kanye West is first and 
foremost an “asshole”, and 
musician second, holding and 
listening to Yeezus today in light 
of his architectural footprint 
seems to communicate a vision 
clear enough to remove all 
doubt regarding his multimedia 
genius. Where The Life of Pablo 
is more a product of 1950s Los 
Angeles “Googie” architecture, 
Yeezus is as cold and balanced 
as a Bauhaus product in every 
sense.

—

The core tenet of Bauhaus 

industrial design is structural 
transparency; clarity is the 
ultimate sophistication.

As we all know, the now-

infamous 
physical 
copies 

of Yeezus are designed as 
functionalist CD cases. No 
bells and whistles; the function 
is simply to house the disc. 
While touring a specific unit 

in Lafayette Park, I remember 
taking note a of a sink that was 
particularly helpful in making 
this connection.

Where most sinks contain 

features 
like 
cabinets 
and 

cupboards 
to 
abstract 
the 

underlying plumbing, this sink 
hid nothing. The frame of the 
sink was only inches deep (as 
little as necessary to funnel 
the water), with two iron pegs 
as support. The infrastructure 
set in place for plumbing was 
also completely visible — no 
ornamentation. 
One 
could 

easily identify weight-bearing 
components of the sink, and 
follow the path of the water 
from start to finish. While a CD 
case isn’t nearly as dynamic as 
a sink with moving parts, the 
design philosophy remains the 
same.

Aside from Kanye himself, 

the first names that come 
to mind when I think of the 
Yeezus era are Rick Rubin and 
Virgil Abloh — Kanye’s creative 
director. Virgil has a masters 
degree in Architecture from the 
Illinois Institute of Technology 
in 
Chicago, 
where 
Mies 

himself has actually designed 
the curriculum (it should be 
noted that West has also been 
documented Googling Mies in 
Paris around the same time).

While I had the privilege of 

SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

visiting Virgil’s “Off-White” 
store 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
two 

summers ago, an employee 
spoke to me about how Virgil 
himself participated in the 
design process for the tropical 
storefront. There is no doubt 
that he, as a seasoned architect 
educated to Mies’ liking, had a 
hand in the creative direction 
of Yeezus.

Sonically, the album draws 

from Rick Rubin’s minimalist 
zen in addition to the sparse 
spaces that birthed it. Billing 
himself as more of a “reducer” 
than “producer,” Rubin was 
largely responsible for fleshing 
out the entire album over 
the course of a week. I still 
remember 
running 
through 

My Beautiful Dark Twisted 
Fantasy all day in anticipation 
of my first listen through 
Yeezus, and in hindsight, this 
was terrible preparation to 
hear an album made by a guy 
who reinvents himself twice a 
year. Where Twisted Fantasy 
is architecturally equivalent to 
something like the classically 
ornate 
Pantheon, 
Rubin 

stripped Yeezus down to a 
carbon-fiber skeleton.

The end of “I’m In It”, for 

example, has a certain space 
and volume about it that lurches 
and collapses in on itself; the 
high-hats don’t layer so much 
as they wait for one another, 
spacing themselves out and 
alternating between left and 
right 
channels. 
Somewhere 

in the middle, Kanye remains 
in focus, but rapping as if his 
words 
intermittently 
pass 

through a strobe light. The 
bass kicks up dust with every 
iteration. The song sounds like 
a hollowed-out sex factory.

 “I Am A God” kicks off with 

an echo that bounces around 
some freezing abyss. Kanye’s 
voice is warped and permuted 

into variations of itself, flying 
in from all directions. Even on 
the 100th listen you struggle to 
predict where he comes from.

The most venomous track 

on the album, “New Slaves”, 
is driven by a single synth 

melody; it feels as hollow as 
the loft it was written in, and 
as cold as the stone it originally 
vibrated on. Again, Kanye’s 
voice is an industrial hammer-
blow between keystrokes. His 
panting on “Black Skinhead” 
seems to drip sweat on the 
barking synths that open the 
track. Each and every song 
is 
arranged 
with 
enough 

elements for you to count on 

one hand, but together they 
form soundscapes built on the 
Bauhaus design language.

In the same way that an 

architect 
places 
walls 
and 

columns to create a structure 
that 
you 
can 
navigate 

experientially, 
Yeezus 
sees 

Kanye narrow in on specific 
sonic elements like a synth or 
808, and guide them through 
various crevices of a single 
track. The sparse layers create 
spaces in songs that don’t 
exist 
elsewhere 
in 
Kanye’s 

discography; for the first time, 
Kanye 
ditches 
church 
and 

orchestra rehearsal to play with 
fire in an industrial complex. 
If 
his 
traditionally 
lush 

instrumentation 
suffocates 

you through raw enumeration 
(think: how many people must 
have been in that “Ultralight 
Beam” choir?), Yeezus throws 
you through a meatgrinder in 
an empty warehouse.

The whole album reminds 

me of one of Mies’ most 
famous sketches — a piece 
titled “Concert Hall” — where 
he draws 2D planes on an 
image of an empty airplane 
factory. The tessellation of 
beams and columns creates a 
certain elegance possible only 
through 
Bauhaus 
structural 

transparency; yet, the space 
between the columns creates 
a cold, airless vacuum. This 
is the space that Yeezus — the 
Bauhaus album — occupies.

It was assembled with the 

sophistication of mid-century 
modern 
industrialism 
and 

architecture, 
yet 
executed 

with the cold ruthlessness of a 
Black man denied entry to the 
bourgeoisie world of fashion. In 
one motion, he creates a project 
to show that he can “do it too”, 
but won’t let you in unless you 
cut the red tape first.

The core tenet 

of Bauhaus 

industrial design 

is structural 
transparency; 

clarity is 

the ultimate 
sophistication

Where Kanye 
travels to and 

creates his music 
is, in my opinion, 

the greatest 

indication of the 
space he intends 
for his music to 

occupy

In the same way 
that an architect 
places walls and 
columns to create 
a structure that 
you can navigate 

experientially, 
‘Yeezus’ sees 

Kanye narrow in 
on specific sonic 
elements like a 
synth or 808

With some movies, what 

you see is what you get. “Going 
in Style” is one 
of those movies. 
There’s little on 
the surface here 
and 
even 
less 

underneath, 
but 

what is there is 
usually 
funny 

enough to carry 
it 
through 
its 

moments 
of 

weakness. The cast is game, 
if underutilized, and when 
director Zach Braff (“Wish 
I 
Was 
Here”) 
taps 
into 

the energy a bank robbery 
naturally invites — even one 
perpetrated by octogenarians 
— his newest flick becomes a 
treat.

Updated from the 1979 film 

of the same name, “Going in 
Style” tells the story of three 
seniors who decide to rob 
a bank after their pension 
fund is dissolved. Without a 
doubt, Alan Arkin (“Argo”), 
Morgan Freeman (“Ben-Hur”) 
and 
Michael 
Caine 
(“The 

Last Witch Hunter”) are the 
movie’s greatest assets, and it’s 
a shame Braff doesn’t lean on 
them as often as they deserve. 
The interplay between them 
works more often than not, 
and together they are able to 
foster a believable longtime 

relationship 
between 
their 

characters.

Of the three, Arkin’s deadpan 

cynicism as Albert makes him 
a standout, though it’s not that 
difficult a competition. The 

actors may be 
solid, as befits 
their 
Academy 

Award-winning 
statuses, 
but 

their characters 
need 
work. 

Caine plays Joe, 
who 
hatches 

the initial idea 
to rob the bank 

but is otherwise the most one-
note, 
plainly 
good-natured 

guy onscreen at any given 
moment. Freeman, who only 
goes along with the plan to get 
a new kidney, has apparently 
reached the point in his iconic 
career where all producers 
can think to do with him is 
place him in mortal danger 
for a heavy-handed lesson in 
mortality. Given this material, 
it’s almost more impressive 
that 
Caine, 
Freeman 
and 

Arkin make their Joe, Willie 
and Albert as lifelike as they 
do.

That being said, there are 

flashes throughout the film 
of the wit and personality 
that these stars deserve. A 
mid-story “training montage” 
provides the film’s pacing a 
shot in the arm and is well-
photographed 
and 
edited, 

using inventive graphics and 

inserts to chart the three 
men’s progress as wannabe 
robbers. The heist itself is a 
fun show of each character’s 
personality, and Arkin again 
steal the show with a surprise 
“Heat”-like monologue.

Ultimately, 
what 
“Going 

in 
Style” 
lacks 
most 
is 

personality. Besides its stars, it 
is almost irritatingly lethargic. 
Its story is very reminiscent of 
“Tower Heist,” but it lacks the 
energy, comic or otherwise, 
that could have sustained 
it through its many slower 
moments. Instead, it spends 
time on forced life lessons 
that could have been spent on 
comedy and characters, both 
of which would have helped it 
stand out. As it is, it’s mostly 
just a string of “I’m too old for 
this” and “Fish out of water” 
jokes that get old fast, placing 
more and more pressure on 
the leads and their chemistry.

Thankfully, 
the 
trio 
of 

legends prove up to the task. 
Due to their work, “Going in 
Style” rises just above its generic 
roots to become a charming 
enough 
comedy 
that 
likely 

won’t be remembered by many 
by the end of the year. It would 
be hard to argue that that’s not 
the point, though. Braff wasn’t 
trying to remake the wheel here. 
By all appearances, his goal 
was to make a goofy comedy 
with three of the best actors of 
their generation, and in that he 
succeeded.

Some Exodus films not 
to pass over this holiday

As Passover approaches, some notable films may be of value

’Tis the season, my friends, 

’tis the season. ’Tis the season 
for macaroons, matzo balls 
and mishpacha (family). As 
Passover approaches, I thought 
it would only be appropriate to 
highlight some of my personal 
favorite holiday movies. Sure, 
we 
don’t 
have 
delightful 

movies like Christmas does. 
There is no Passover version 
of “It’s a Wonderful Life” or “A 
Christmas Story,” but there is 
potential. “A Passover Story,” 
where all Ralphie wants for 
Passover is an official Red 
Ryder, carbine action, two-
hundred shot range model 
air rifle — OK, it needs some 
work. Still, Passover movies 
are full of drama, tragedy and 
the 
booming, 
omnipresent 

voice of The Almighty (usually 
something like James Earl 
Jones). While Passover movies 
may not be jolly or joyful, they 
tell the story of the holiday 
much better than your Uncle 
or Zaide.

In addition to the four cups 

of wine and the eating of the 
bitter herbs, my family has 
another Passover tradition. 
Each 
Passover, 
we 
make 

ourselves 
comfortable 
and 

watch the 220-minute long 
depiction of the Exodus story: 
Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Ten 
Commandments.” 
This 
one 

is a classic; a melodramatic, 
historically inaccurate, 1950s 
version of the familiar tale. 
No matter how overdone and 
cheesy it may be, I love every 
second of this three and half 
hour epic. If you have seen 

the film, you know the scene 
where Anne Baxter’s Nefretiri 
(fake history) lures Moses into 
her chambers with a moan 
so deep it borders between 
orgasm 
and 
chainsmoker. 

Charlton Heston (“Ben-Hur”) 
is the chiseled Egyptian prince 
turned Hebrew slave liberator, 
Moses. 
Heston 
embodies 

Moses, like Marlon Brando as 
“The Don” or Harrison Ford as 
anything. The film is kitschy, 
but it feels like home in a way 
not many movies do.

This next one stars the likes 

of Val Kilmer, Sandra Bullock, 
Jeff Goldblum, Ralph Fiennes, 
Patrick 
Stewart 
and 
even 

Dame Helen Mirren. No, I am 
not describing a heist movie. 
I am talking about the 1998 
animated film, “The Prince 
of Egypt” (now on Netflix!). 
Despite it being animated, the 
film has the cinematic scope 
and drama of a live action. 
The drawn characters and 
catchy tunes make the story 
approachable and charming. 
The silly, sorcerer priests, 
Hotep and Huy are played by 
the kings of comedy, two of 
“The Three Amigos,” Steve 
Martin and Martin Short, 
respectively. No matter how 
many times I have seen it, 
and that being many, I always 
end up belting out “When 
You Believe” with no shame 
whatsoever.

The 
most 
recent 
foray 

into 
the 
Exodus 
story 

was attempted in 2014 by 
Ridley Scott (“Alien”) in his 
expansive, 
epic, 
overdone 

“Exodus: Gods and Kings.” The 
film’s goal is to apparently tell 
the Passover story, but it feels 
more like Scott took his film 

“Gladiator” and superimposed 
it over a poorly told, heavily 
fabricated summary of the 
book of Exodus. I had trouble 
seeing 
Christopher 
Nolan’s 

Batman (Christian Bale) as 
Moses and Jesus Quintana 
(John Turturro) from “The 
Big Lebowski” as Pharaoh. 
The special effects rule this 
film (I don’t think the real 
plagues were as intense as 
Scott’s version) so much so 
that the story gets washed 
out. “Exodus” is dominated by 
sibling rivalry, God complexes, 
an 
excessive 
amount 
of 

eyeliner and unfortunately not 
much else. For now, let’s leave 
the Biblical source material to 
Darren Aronofsky.

These 
Passover-themed 

films 
offer 
three 
very 

different approaches to one 
amazing story. The first is 
a classic, the next a beloved 
childhood memory, the last 
is, well, last. But the final and 
best rendition of the Passover 
story, by far, is the “Rugrats 
Passover 
Special.” 
Initially 

broadcast in 1995, before I was 
born, it’s played every year 
since on VHS in my family 
living room. Grandpa Boris, 
hoping to shed the light of the 
holiday onto the children, tells 
them the story of Passover. In 
this version, Tommy Pickles is 
Moses, liberating the enslaved 
babies (Hebrews) from the 
wicked Angelica (Pharaoh). 
It is the perfect amount of 
entertainment and nostalgia 
to add to your Passover.

So grab some matzo, sit 

back, relax and enjoy the story 
of freedom, faith and family. 
Happy Passover!

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Rethinking art in ‘artless’

I 
was 
sitting 
in 
my 

Anthropology 
101 
lecture, 

watching the documentary “In 
and Out of Africa,” when I finally 
came to an understanding.

The documentary is about the 

African art dealer Gabai Barre, 
who travels from the rural Ivory 
Coast to Long Island, selling his 
work. He explains his creation 
process, and the documentary 
addresses the idea of authenticity 
and exchange values.

One of the people interviewed 

poses the question: Is something 
considered art if it’s being created 
to be sold? The question hit me 
as extremely relevant, and not 
just in the context of African art 
exchange. Can art be constituted 
art even when it is created solely 
with the audience’s preferences 
in mind?

The woman being interviewed 

went on to answer her own 
question, discussing how she 
believes it is still artwork, because 
it contains the mind of the artist. 
Perhaps this is true. Perhaps to 
a certain extent, all artists think 
about 
their 
audiences 
when 

creating their work.

Another 
important 
facet 

of 
African 
art 
exchange 
is 

replication. Barre admitted that 
many of his Western customers 
wanted an original piece. He 

would reassure them that they 
were the first ones to see his new 
work, when in reality, the same 
piece had already been sold to 
others.

This raises questions about 

the 
relationship 
between 

replication and true creation. In 
the context of Barre’s work, it 
could still be argued that there 
is nontraditional artistry in his 
work. If one pursues art as a 
profession, then their work is 
being created to be sold. The goal 
is for their pieces to generate a 
profit.

While many famous artists 

such as Vincent van Gogh or 
Claude Monet were not profitable 
during most of, if not their entire 
lifetimes, their work was initially 
considered 
either 
successful 

or unsuccessful based off the 
monetary value of their art.

Barre and other African art 

dealers are profitable because 
they factor in what their buyers 
seem to prefer. After working 
with a buyer several times, 
they develop an understanding 
of what their buyer wants, 
something of which even their 
buyers are often not aware. This 
showcases an inherent artistry in 
the practices of these art dealers. 
It’s unconventional, because the 
artistry is in their understanding 
of the artistic styles that their 
customers want and their ability 
to produce this.

The 
issue 
of 
replication 

does 
raise 
ethical 
concerns, 

considering that their customers 
are being deceived. Setting aside 
this problem, replication of an 
artist’s own work is not wrong — 
depending on the artist, it could 
be even more artistic than the 
original piece, allowing the artist 
to rethink some of the concepts 
and ideas behind it.

Many 
of 
these 
questions 

stem from the monetization 
of artwork. Many African art 
dealers like Barre use this to 
their advantage by blending their 
talent with marketing skills and 
creating an intriguing and artful 
practice to analyze. Likewise, 
many famous actors, musicians 
and entertainment celebrities 
are 
economically 
successful 

because they capitalize on the 
monetization of artwork. Instead 
of minimizing the artistry in 
the work, maybe we should 
consider their work to be artistic 
in a different way, for their 
understanding of their audiences.

The Monets of history were 

ahead 
of 
their 
times, 
only 

gaining recognition very late 
in their lives or after death, 
making little money during their 
lifetimes. However, they are now 
considered 
highly 
influential 

artists who were leaders in 
artistic movements.

Wolverines search for next hockey coach

At the end of the past few 

seasons, Red Berenson’s status as 
the coach of the Michigan hockey 
team was in question. It was 
thought that he would retire after 
the 2015-16 season, but athletic 
director Warde Manuel convinced 
him to stay for another year.

Monday, Berenson finally put 

an end to all the questions, as he 
officially stepped down from his 
position with the team.

Now, for the first time in 33 

seasons, the Wolverines are in 
search of a new coach.

With Berenson’s status as coach 

being uncertain over the past few 
years, there has been plenty of 
time to speculate on who would 
take his position when he did 
retire. The Daily breaks down 
some of the possible candidates for 
his replacement at Michigan.

Mel Pearson:
Pearson is currently the head 

coach at Michigan Tech, where 
he has led the Huskies to NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances 
in 

two of the last three seasons as 
well as a Western Conference 
Hockey Association Tournament 
championship last season.

Pearson was an assistant under 

Berenson with the Wolverines 
from 1988-2011, and was long 
believed to be the coach-in-waiting 
for when Berenson retired. But 
after joining — and finding success 
with — Michigan Tech, it’s unclear 
if Pearson would be willing to 
come back to Ann Arbor.

Pearson may be the most 

qualified candidate for Michigan. 
One of the areas that has plagued 
the Wolverines in recent seasons 
is 
their 
ineptitude 
in 
Corsi 

percentage — just last season 
they were the third-worst team 
nationally in the category, which 
measures all shot attempts taken at 
even strength. On the other hand, 
Pearson’s Huskies have ranked in 
the top-five in Corsi percentage in 
each of the last three seasons.

All in all, if Pearson would be 

willing to return to Michigan, it 

seems as though the two would 
make a good fit.

Brian Wiseman:
Wiseman 
played 
for 
the 

Wolverines from 1991-94 and 
accrued 164 assists in his career, 
the most in program history. He 
has served as an assistant coach 
under Berenson since 2011. As a 
result, he is intimately familiar 
with the current team, so the 
transition from Berenson to him 
would presumably be smooth.

Additionally, 
Wiseman 
has 

taken a lead role in recruiting 
efforts over the last few seasons. 
He has traveled around the 
country, and in some cases, was 
the main contact between recruits 
and Michigan.

On the downside, Wiseman’s 

tenure 
coincides 
with 
the 

Wolverines’ struggles in recent 
years. This is not to say that 
Wiseman is responsible, but if 
Michigan wants to change its 
program’s 
momentum, 
hiring 

someone who is currently in the 
program may be counterintuitive. 

Billy Powers:
Powers’ situation is somewhat 

similar to that of Wiseman. After 
beginning his playing career at 
Division II St. Anselm, Powers 
transferred to Michigan as a part 
of Berenson’s first recruiting class 
in 1985. He played the next three 
years with the Wolverines, and 
after his college career was over, 
he immediately transitioned into 
being a graduate assistant with 
Michigan.

Powers has been with the 

Wolverines ever since, and after 
Pearson left, he was promoted to 
the associate head coach position 
that he holds today.

Like 
Wiseman, 
Powers 
is 

extremely close to the program. 
He was a part of the NCAA 
Championships in 1996 and 1998, 
and he’s also been a part of the 
recent decline.

So, again, if Michigan is looking 

to change directions with its 
program, Powers doesn’t seem to fit 
the bill. Unlike Wiseman, though, 
Powers has more experience in a 
coaching capacity, so hiring him 

now may be a safer bet.

Bill Muckalt:
Muckalt is a bit more of an 

outside candidate than the other 
three because he hasn’t coached 
under Berenson. He does have 
substantial 
and 
successful 

coaching experience, though.

Muckalt played his college 

career at Michigan from 1994-
1998 and was a part of both NCAA 
Championship teams. From there, 
he experienced a short, six-year 
professional career.

Muckalt moved on to become 

an assistant coach at Eastern 
Michigan 
before 
bouncing 

around as an assistant on a few 
junior hockey teams. He then 
reconnected with Pearson, his 
former associate head coach with 
the Wolverines at Michigan Tech.

In 2015, Muckalt got his shot 

as a head coach with the United 
States Hockey League’s Tri-City 
Storm, where he led the Storm to 
its first ever USHL championship 

in his first season at the helm.

Muckalt appears to be a good 

option for Michigan in today’s 
world of hockey, as he is only 42 
and would be able to relate to 
recruits more easily.

***
At Berenson’s retirement press 

conference, he was asked what he 
wanted from his successor.

“I hope there’s some Michigan 

awareness 
or 
Michigan 

connection for a coach that will 
feel the right way about what a 
Michigan man should be like and 
what a Michigan team should be 
like,” Berenson said.

Pearson, 
Wiseman, 
Powers 

and Muckalt certainly fit that bill 
with their coaching and playing 
experience with the Wolverines.

And even if Michigan decides 

to hire somebody other than those 
four, one thing is for certain: after 
33 years under Berenson, the next 
head coach will have enormous 
shoes to fill. 

Hill learning intricacies of fullback position

Can a fullback be the face of a 

modern college football team’s 
offense?

That may be the question 

surrounding 
the 
Michigan 

football team this year.

The Wolverines lost the bulk 

of last season’s playmakers to 
graduation. They did, however, 
receive some good news when 
Khalid 
Hill, 
their 
resident 

touchdown vulture also known 
as the ‘Hammering Panda,’ 
decided to return for one final 
year.

Hill admitted it would be nice 

to be considered the face of the 
offense. Since Jim Harbaugh’s 
arrival, the fullback has been 
integral to Michigan’s scheme. 
But Hill reserved that term 
for Wilton Speight, the team’s 
returning starting quarterback.

He 
may 
be 
underselling 

himself. Hill scored 13 times 
last season, by far the most of 
any returning skill position 
player and more than a third 
of the team’s total rushing and 

receiving 
touchdowns 
from 

returning players.

So that mantle — of being 

the focal point of the offense — 
may have to be shared between 
Hill and Speight, regardless of 
whether Hill denies it while 
saying he’s “just” a fullback.

Because if you believe what 

he has said about his offseason, 
it certainly seems like the fifth-
year senior is gearing up for 
what may be a larger role, even 
after his breakout season last 
year.

After all, he feels like he 

could be even better at what 
may 
be 
Harbaugh’s 
most 

beloved position.

“I feel more comfortable 

with the fullback position,” Hill 
said Tuesday night. “… Last year 
was like, ‘Do the best you can.’ 
This year I’m kinda focusing on 
those small things and getting 
better at those.”

That attention to the small 

things is a lesson he learned 
from his first season as a starter, 
after switching positions from 
tight end to fullback.

It’s also a lesson he saw in 

action while observing the 
NFL coaches and scouts in 
attendance at Michigan’s Pro 
Day.

In past years, Hill only 

watched the 40-yard dashes. 
But this year, he stayed for the 
rest of the drills, and quickly 
noticed 
the 

NFL personnel 
were 
looking 

for the details 
from each drill 
— how a player 
flipped his hips, 
or whether he 
could 
catch 
a 

ball 
without 

slowing down.

That 
new 

approach 
has 

found its way into his own game, 
from the little things like losing 
weight (still a work in progress, 
he readily admitted) to having 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 

opposing defenses.

“At tight end, you didn’t 

really 
have 
to 
understand 

what defensive fronts there 
are, safety rotations, reading 
defensive linemen stunts, you 

didn’t have to worry about that,” 
Hill said. “Coach Harbaugh 
does a great job of helping us 
see all those things. It’s cool to 
go through that and learn those 
things because it’ll help me in 
the future.”

Hill still enjoys running the 

routes that he 
used to as a tight 
end and claims 
he has the best 
hands 
on 
the 

team. He even 
jokingly lobbied 
passing 
game 

coordinator 
Pep 
Hamilton 

to split him and 
fellow 
fullback 

Henry Poggi out 

wide.

He once wanted to be like 

Delanie Walker, the standout 
tight end whom Jim Harbaugh 
once coached and compared Hill 
to. And while he still watches 
film of Walker, Hill now aspires 
to be more like Kyle Juszczyk 
of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens 
— coached by John Harbaugh 
— after spending much of the 
offseason watching Juszczyk’s 
tape and marveling at his pass-
blocking ability.

When 
Hill 
does 
watch 

his own film, it isn’t of his 
numerous touchdowns. Rather, 
he focuses on his mistakes, 
such as a sack given up against 
Colorado that resulted in a 
defensive touchdown, a fumble 
against Iowa and a missed 
protection against Maryland.

Scoring, Hill said, is difficult. 

But he knows how to do it. 
Now, it’s about learning the 
intricacies 
of 
the 
fullback 

position.

“Actually, two scouts asked 

me why did I stay,” Hill said. 
“I just told them I wanted to 
graduate. … I kinda thought I 
wasn’t at a mature enough stage 
to understand (that) I have to 
take this stuff more seriously.

“Last year was a blessing in 

disguise. I wasn’t expecting to 
have that many touchdowns 
or do what I did. Now that 
I’m doing that, I’ve got to 
understand that I have to take it 
more seriously.”

“This year I’m 
kinda focusing 
on those small 

things”

McDoom boasts 
strong potential

The question was simple. 

Eddie McDoom was asked if 
there was anything he can’t 
do.

The answer came without 

hesitation.

“No, I’m gonna do it all,” 

he said, with a smile cracking 
over his face.

Realistically, it’s not all that 

surprising. McDoom has never 
been short of confidence.

Last November, the then-

freshman wide receiver stood 
in front of the media, and it 
took just over two minutes for 
him to declare that he was the 
fastest player on the Michigan 
football team’s roster. But 
what really stood out was 
the next assertion — that his 
sophomore season would be 
his breakout year.

Now, four months later, 

that 
sophomore 
season 
is 

approaching, 
and 
the 

Wolverines 
need McDoom’s 
prediction 
to 
come 
to 

fruition. 

As 
is 
the 

storyline 
in 

virtually every 
phase of this 
Michigan team, 
the Wolverines 
are dealing with a close-to-
bare cupboard that features 
a collection of talented — but 
young and inexperienced — 
players.

In McDoom’s case, he’s 

being looked to as one player 
among a group of receivers 
tasked 
with 
replacing 
the 

loss of Amara Darboh, Jehu 
Chesson and Jake Butt. That 
trio accounted for 138 of 
Michigan’s 228 receptions, 13 
of the Wolverines’ 20 receiving 
touchdowns and 1,908 of the 
team’s 2,756 receiving yards in 
2016.

McDoom, in his own right, 

enjoyed a successful season 
during his freshman campaign, 
albeit in a specialized role. 
In 
the 
jet 

sweep package, 
McDoom 
amassed 
160 

yards on just 
16 
attempts 

— 
good 
for 

exactly 10 yards 
per carry.

If there was a 

way to quantify 
McDoom’s 
speed, 
that 

may be it. And it’s that same 
speed 
that 
warranted 
the 

proliferation of the booming 
‘Doom’ chant across Michigan 
Stadium 
last 
season 
— 

something he still cracks a 
smile at when remembering 
how he thought he was being 
booed the first time he heard 
it.

Now, though, the jet sweep 

package may not be enough for 
the Wolverines, and McDoom 
will need to be characterized 
for more than raw speed. Last 
year, McDoom notched just 
five catches on the receiving 
end. As the upcoming season 

grows closer, the sophomore 
wide receiver is out to change 
that.

“I feel like I can do way 

more than just be handed jet 
sweeps,” McDoom said. “I can 
go downfield, I can make the 
routes, I can make the catches, 
I can make the big plays that 
they’re asking for, and I’m 
trying to show it.”

Already, McDoom is taking 

the steps toward doing so. He 
indicated that he’s been taking 
reps receiving punts while also 
working in the slot and on the 
outside. But arguably the most 
important thing for McDoom, 
especially in a Jim Harbaugh-
orchestrated offense, is the 
ability to block. In that regard, 
as in nearly every regard, 
McDoom has no doubt he can 
do it.

“Oh, I can block,” McDoom 

said. “It’s not an issue. If I 
need to go out there and hit 
somebody, I’m gonna go out 

there and hit 
somebody.”

And if there’s 

anything 
that 

could serve as 
validation 
of 

the 
progress 

McDoom 
has 

made, it would 
be praise from 
senior receiver 
Maurice 
Ways 
— 
one 

of a limited group of veteran 
receivers expected to see an 
increased role this season. 
Ways even went as far as to 
say he finds himself learning 
things from McDoom, such as 
how to get a good release off 
the line.

“He’s doing really well,” 

Ways said. “He’s playing fast, 
making plays and having fun 
doing it. He’s probably one of 
the most vibrant guys in the 
locker room.

“He just comes to work 

every day with a smile on his 
face, loving football, and he’ll 
be out in practice having a 
good time. I appreciate his 
enthusiasm he brings to the 
game, brings to practice, and it 

kind of rubs off 
on the rest of 
us.”

For 

McDoom, that 
enthusiasm 
is 

just one aspect 
of a personality 
more confident 
than 
a 
king 

at 
his 
own 

coronation. 
And 
as 
is 

quickly becoming the norm for 
him, Tuesday was a day void 
of hesitation. He said he can 
block. He said he can run the 
routes, make the catches and 
flash the big-play ability. He 
said he can do it all.

So 
the 
time 
is 
coming 

for everyone to find out, is 
this really Eddie McDoom’s 
breakout year?

“Hey, I think so,” Ways said. 

“Eddie has all the tools to be a 
great receiver. Like I said, the 
sky is the limit for him. He can 
be as good as he wants to be, as 
great as he wants to be. I’ve got 
all the confidence in him.”

Michigan aims for 
another win streak 

After its 14-game win streak 

was snapped Sunday at the 
hands of No. 25 Ohio State, the 
No. 18 Michigan softball team 
(8-1 Big Ten, 28-8-1 overall) is 
determined 
to 
start 
a 

new 
string 

of 
victories 

as it squares 
up 
against 

Michigan 
State (5-4 Big 
Ten, 
21-12 

overall) 
on 

Wednesday 
night. 

The 

midweek 
game between 
the 
two 

in-state rivals 
was originally 
scheduled to be in East Lansing 
— the first of a home-and-home 
series over the next two weeks 
— but floods from the Red 
Cedar River left the softball 
facilities unusable, forcing the 
game to be relocated to Ann 
Arbor.

Following 
a 
seven-game 

winless skid, the Spartans have 
rebounded, winning six of their 
last seven contests. Five of 
those wins have come against 
Big Ten schools — including a 
sweep of Maryland and two of 
three against Penn State.

Seven players on Michigan 

State’s squad that have 62 or 
more at-bats under their belt 
post a batting average of .300 
or higher. Junior outfielder 
Lea 
Foerster 
stands 
out 

among them, boasting a .420 
batting clip and a .870 slugging 
percentage.

However, 
the 
Spartans’ 

recent 
success 
looks 
meek 

compared to the Wolverines’ 
impressive 
play 
the 
past 

month. Michigan has won 14 of 
its last 15 games, and is 8-1 in 

Big Ten play — tied with No. 6 
Minnesota for the best record 
in conference play.

Sophomore second baseman 

Faith Canfield continues to be 
the top offensive producer for 
the Wolverines, as she went 
7-for-10 
during 
Saturday’s 

doubleheader. 
She 
was 

complemented by four hits 
apiece from senior shortstop 
Abby 
Ramirez 
and 
junior 

first 
baseman 
Aidan 
Falk. 

Despite that hitting explosion, 
Michigan failed to score a 
single run in the final game of 
the series Sunday, registering a 
mere three hits in a 5-0 defeat 
to the Buckeyes.

Though there are no specific 

indications about how a short 
lead-up to the Michigan State 
matchup will alter practice 
routines, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins continues to preach 
the importance of consistent 
improvement — notably, higher 
quality swings, especially with 
runners in scoring position. 
She believes in approaching 
every game with the same 
mental fortitude, regardless 
of the opponent’s ranking and 
skill.

“My goal is for us to just keep 

getting better,” Hutchins said. 
“We’ve gotten a lot better in the 
last month and two months, but 
I thought we took a step back 
(Sunday). We can’t ever think 
that we’re done getting better.”

Added Canfield: “We’ll work 

on going out there every game 
to attack, and not giving in so 
easily.”

Hutchins also says excelling 

in the face of adversity is 
important to work on, which is 
something she didn’t see out of 
her squad against Ohio State on 
Sunday.

“We get our toughness when 

things don’t go our way, not 
just when things go our way,” 
Hutchins said. “And we need to 
be tougher when things aren’t 
going our way.”

With strong defensive effort, Wolverines 
outlast Eastern Michigan in extra innings 

With a man on second 

base, sophomore right fielder 
Jonathan Engelmann hit a ball 
deep to centerfield. It appeared 
it might leave the park for a 
walk-
off home 
run, but it 
bounced 
off the wall instead. Still, the 
hit was enough to bring junior 
first 
baseman 
Jake 
Bivens 

across the plate for the game-
ending double. 

It may have taken 13 innings, 

but 
the 
No. 
13 
Michigan 

baseball 
team 
secured 
the 

win over Eastern Michigan on 
Tuesday afternoon, 2-1.

The Wolverines were the 

first on the board after Bivens 
and 
sophomore 
designated 

hitter Nick Poirier both hit 
identical 
singles 
past 
the 

first 
baseman. 
Engelmann 

followed it up by grounding 
into a double play, but it was 
enough to bring Bivens home. 
After putting up the run in 
the second inning, the offense 
slowed considerably until the 
Engelmann RBI finally ended 
the game.

After Michigan fell into 

early holes in multiple games 
against 
Illinois 
over 
the 

weekend, the Wolverines made 
a point to avoid that against 
the 
Eagles. 
Junior 
right-

hander Jayce Vancena wasted 
no time in the first inning, 
striking out the side with ease. 
He’s normally not a pitcher 
known for strikeouts, but tied 
his career high of six in the 
midweek outing.

Along with fanning batters, 

Vancena’s 
usual 
style 
of 

pitching into ground balls was 
in full swing Tuesday, and his 
teammates behind him did not 
disappoint.

In such a low scoring game, 

the defense made a point to be 
sharper than ever.

“I 
think 
the 
defense 

definitely won us the game 
today,” said sophomore second 
baseman 
Ako 
Thomas. 
“It 

was tough out 
there, 
a 
lot 

of line drives 
that didn’t fall. 
Today we had to 
scrap, and that’s 
what we did and 
we came out on 
top.”

The 
defense 

was 
on 
full 

display in the 
fourth 
inning 

when 
Eastern 
Michigan’s 

designated 
hitter 
Brennan 

Williams hit a double to the 
right field wall. Engelmann 
collected it off the wall and 
relayed it to Thomas, who 
then made the throw to senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson to 

tag an Eagle out at the plate.

That 
would 
have 
been 

Eastern Michigan’s first run 
of the game and would have 
changed the situation of the 
inning completely. The play 

meant 
that 

there was one 
out and a man 
on second, as 
opposed to no 
outs, a run and a 
man on second. 

“That in itself 

was 
a 
huge 

momentum 
shift 
in 
our 

favor,” 
said 

Michigan coach 

Erik Bakich. “But the execution 
of the relay from Engelmann, 
to Ako, to Wenson with the 
good catch-tag, it was perfectly 
executed.

“That’s exactly like they’ve 

trained to do and they did it 
perfectly.”

Through 13 innings, seven 

Wolverines came out of the 
bullpen to help keep Michigan 
in the game. Senior right-
hander 
Jackson 
Lamb 
— 

normally just the ninth-inning 
closer — pitched 2.1 innings 
and struck out four batters. But 
it was freshman right-hander 
Karl Kauffman who picked up 
the win after striking out two 
batters and forcing a pop up 
in just 13 pitches in the 13th 
inning.

“We have a pitching staff 

that can shut any team down,” 
Bivens said. “We’re going to try 
and score runs on offense, but 
we know our pitchers always 
have our back.”

While the players in the field 

and on the bump may have 
won this game for Michigan, 
the Wolverines will need to 
rediscover 
their 
offensive 

prowess before they face No. 18 
Oklahoma on Thursday.

Pitching, defense lead to victory for ‘M’

With a runner on first in 

the 
fourth 
inning, 
Eastern 

Michigan 
designated 
hitter 

Brennan 
Williams 
lashed 
a 

liner into right field. Michigan 
sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann caught up to the ball 
at the warning track, and turned 
around to see Eagle centerfielder 
Jeremy 
Stidham 
barreling 

around second base, showing no 
signs of slowing down. 

Without 
hesitation, 

Engelmann fired the ball to 
sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Ako Thomas, whose relay throw 
reached senior catcher Harrison 
Wenson a split-second before 
Stidham slid home.

“It needed a good throw from 

Engelmann and Ako, and it 
needed a good catch and a hard 
tag from Wenson,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We got all of 
them.”

The successful relay preserved 

a 1-0 lead for the No. 13 Michigan 
baseball team (6-3 Big Ten, 26-7 
overall), and proved even more 
crucial after Eastern Michigan 
(4-2 Mid-American, 12-20) tied 
the game in the seventh inning. 
Without a stellar effort on the 
mound and in the field, the 
Wolverines wouldn’t have been 
able to grind out a 13-inning, 2-1 
win against the Eagles.

While Michigan’s offense – 

which has averaged 8.3 runs 
over its last 11 games – has 
received most of the attention 
recently, its defense has been just 
as spectacular. After Tuesday 
night’s error-free performance, 
the Wolverines now rank 10th 
in the nation with a fielding 
percentage of .983.

In the outfield, Engelmann, 

redshirt sophomore left fielder 
Miles Lewis and senior center 
fielder 
Johnny 
Slater 
have 

recorded 171 putouts without an 
error. Meanwhile, the infield of 
Thomas, junior first baseman 
Jake 
Bivens, 
junior 
third 

baseman Drew Lugbauer and 
senior shortstop Michael Brdar 
have combined to commit just 
nine errors on the year.

Bivens, last season’s third 

baseman, crossed the diamond 
to first base this year due to 
offseason Tommy John surgery 
which 
limited 
his 
throwing 

ability, while Lugbauer moved 
from 
first 
to 
take 
Bivens’ 

place. The pair’s versatility – 
both played shortstop in high 
school – has given Michigan 
exceptional 
athleticism 
from 

the corner positions, where this 
type of athleticism isn’t always 
prioritized. 
Against 
Eastern 

Michigan, Bivens highlighted 
his 
performance 
by 
leaping 

high to snare a high-bouncing 
grounder in the second inning, 
while Lugbauer’s arm strength 
consistently made tough throws 
seem routine.

“When you think about corner 

guys, you don’t necessarily think 
of them as premium athletes,” 
Bakich said. “But we feel like 
we’ve got four shortstops on the 
infield, which gives us a lot of 
range and athleticism and allows 
a lot of playmaking abilities.”

Meanwhile, 
Michigan’s 

pitching staff has fed right 
into the defense’s strengths 
– thriving with an increased 
emphasis on attacking hitters 
and pitching to contact. Against 
Eastern Michigan, Wolverine 
pitchers walked just two of the 
48 batters they faced, and threw 

68 percent of their pitches for 
strikes.

“We just want to let the defense 

work,” Bakich said. “Something 
we struggled with last year was 
nibbling and avoiding contact. If 
there are a lot of lulls every single 
inning, you get caught on your 
heels sometimes and you don’t 
play as good defense.

“When the pitching staff is 

relentlessly attacking the strike 
zone and forcing a lot of contact, 
and the pitchers are trusting 
that defenders are going to make 
those plays, those defenders 
stay engaged. It’s easier to play 
behind pitchers that are just 
attack, attack, attack.”

Tuesday night’s starter, junior 

right-hander Jayce Vancena, is 
one of those pitchers. He was 
ruthlessly 
efficient 
against 

Eastern Michigan, throwing just 
62 pitches in five innings, striking 
out five and allowing three hits. 
Perhaps 
most 
impressively, 

Vancena did not surrender a walk 
– in 29 innings this season, he has 
yet to do so.

“In the infield, we don’t want 

to be standing out there all day,” 
Thomas said. “Jayce is known 
for working quick and getting 
everybody ground balls.”

Added Bivens: “He’s been 

attacking the zone all year. He’s 

a great pitcher – we just love 
playing behind him. We trust in 
him and we believe in him.”

When Vancena exited after 

the fifth inning, the bullpen 
picked up right where he left off, 
striking out 10 batters in eight 
innings and allowing just five 
hits. While senior right-hander 
Jackson Lamb highlighted the 
group by striking out four in a 
career-high 2.1 innings, it was 
freshman 
right-hander 
Karl 

Kauffman who picked up the win 
with two strikeouts in the 13th 
inning.

“We knew we had some older 

guys that had some experience,” 
Bakich said. “We also knew we 
had some very talented freshmen 
coming in with (left-hander 
Tommy) Henry and Kauffman 
and even (right-hander) Jack 
Weisenburger in that mix. But 
we have a lot of depth – that’s an 
area that’s a huge priority in our 
program.”

All season – and especially 

against 
Eastern 
Michigan 
– 

Michigan has proven it has the 
talent and mentality on defense 
to win low-scoring slugfests. 
Even if its offense can’t push 
runs across the plate, if Tuesday 
night’s game is any indication, 
the Wolverines will be in good 
shape.

Golden State Worrior: Closure.Mov

A

t work on Thursday, my boss, who is 
a kind 40-something woman named 
Melisa, asked me if it had “set in” that I 
was leaving the University of Michigan.

No, I answered, it really hasn’t.

Which is true; it really hasn’t. Not wanting 

to 
jinx 
my 
temporary 
lack 
of 
existential 

dread about leaving college, I changed the 
subject, or thought I did, to the topic of 
YoutubeCommencementSpeechSchlisselGate.

I told her we weren’t having a commencement 

speaker and that I was upset about it. Which is also 
true; I was, and am, upset.

This whole speech situation really did bum me out. 

It bummed me out more than I wanted it to bum me 
out and, frankly, more than it is appropriate. There 
are objectively much worse things in the world, and 
in Michigan, and in Ann Arbor, and in decisions that 
the University of Michigan makes or doesn’t make 
that should bum me out exponentially more. In fact, 
I think most people who are bummed out about the 
lack of a graduation speaker would also throw in the 
caveat that it’s not that bad, it’s just …

To me, it kinda feels like one of those things that 

we’re gonna look back on and think, “They did 
what?” Like when OKC traded Harden, or when 
Damian Marley and Nas did an album together, or 
“Limitless” the TV show sans Bradley Cooper, etc. It 
all sort of made sense at the time, but everyone had a 
feeling it wasn’t going to work out.

Of course the University isn’t trying to sabotage 

our graduation. Marky Mark Schlissel doesn’t have 
some vendetta against us. It was a decision as much 
as hiring Brady Hoke, raising the price of student 
tickets or closing the Taco Bell in the Michigan 
League.

I did not say all of this to Melisa. We got to 

talking about her week and then came one of my 
favorite parts of my Thursday. The part where 
I get to knowingly nod in agreement when she 
says things like, “Man, it’s been a long week” or 
“Friday can’t come sooner.” I like this part of 
my week so much because, for that moment, we 
could both take solace in the fact that the real world 
sucks and I can quell a nagging belief that I have 
never dealt with an iota of real adversity or true 
monotony in my life.

I think of David Foster Wallace’s claim that soon-

to-be college graduates do not understand what the 
phrase “day in, day out” really means. I certainly 

do not.

I think it would be fair for someone reading this 

to scratch their head at my thought process. They 
might think, and be correct in thinking, that I am 
effectively just visiting real life’s monotony eight 

hours a week, and thus, it isn’t really monotony at 
all. The short and long of their critique might be, “You 
don’t know shit about real life because you work part 
time at a sorority, stop pretending like you do.”

Those critics, strangely of which I am one, are 

right, and that’s part of the reason I’m so bummed 
about having a video replace a human for my 

graduation.

I’ve spent college searching for some morsel of 

truth that will let me cut through the monotony of 
what I perceive real life to be. One way or another, I 
think my peers do the same. We imagine a moment 

where it all makes sense, where we are ready. But 
the other section of our brain quickly reminds us 
that there is no such morsel to find and we block 
it out, like I do every Thursday when Melisa and 
I complain about our tough weeks.

And that is exactly the problem. The 

graduation speech is our last hope. When I close 
my eyes and imagine myself on the 20-yard line 
of the Big House listening to Hillary Clinton — 
or John Stewart or Barack Obama or whomever 
— I’m imagining the speech already in memory 
form, as if it already happened, and already 
imparted some wisdom. I imagine remembering 
the moment where I look at my peers at this 
great University, the Leaders and the Best, the 
champions of the West, and I make eye contact 
with one of my roommates and give him a 
knowing nod: We got this.

Part of me knows this wouldn’t have happened 

even if they brought Bo Schembechler back from 
the grave, but when I saw that our speaker was a 
video, my fantasy was destroyed.

There is literally nothing profound about 

a video, and it’s mainly a numbers game. 
Eight minutes on Instagram, and I can watch 
150 different videos. My fantasy graduation 
inspiration is a singular moment. After Obama 
says, “Thank you,” and I say, “We got this,” 
I’ll get a little sad, knowing how fleeting the 
moment is. Once this video is made available 
on YouTube, I’ll honestly get a better look at it 
when I’m craning my neck up at the big screen. 
It might even be better the second time. Cold 
No Thai is better the second time. Graduations 
shouldn’t be.

Still, the problem is not with Mark, or with 

the video, or with the lack of a keynote, the 
problem is with ourselves. The reason, maybe, 

this speech is causing more outrage than things we 
all agree are more pressing is because it taps into a 
special kind of existential dread. A fear that life is 
a set of small compromises you have to make with 
your own understanding of what a happy life looks 
like, one which is getting sent off by a YouTube 
video.

PHOTO COURTSEY OF HARRISON KRINSKY


Dedicated to the memory of my great-

aunt Tillie Gross, a force to be reckoned 
with and as sharp-minded as they come.
I 

am graduating a year early from 
the University of Michigan, 
receiving a B.A. in international 
studies with a concentration 

in international security, norms and 
cooperation, as well as minors in history 
of art and oceanography.

Yeah, thank you, I would love my gold 

star now please.

The reason I’m starting off with that 

is for my own benefit, really. A lot of 
what this column has been is me trying 
to relate to you, the reader, like I’m Amy 
Poehler’s character in “Mean Girls” 
— the mom who wears a pink Juicy 
track suit and is delightfully desperate 
to be cool. What I’m aiming to do in 
this column, though, is to embody the 
confidence of Lady Gaga in her meat 
dress while coming off as intelligent 
as Rachel Carson and Marie Curie 
to explain why I am OK(ish) about 
graduating and low-key not freaking out 
anymore.

That’s right, you’re about to come on a 

journey of soul-searching with me.

Let’s rewind.
Three years ago, I was a senior in 

high school studying for six AP exams 
and preparing for my final research 
presentation — I had conducted a three-
year-long research project on ocean 
acidification in conjunction with the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration to relative national 
success. I was caught up in the stress of 
unimportant grade school drama and 
slightly disappointed I had committed to 
the University after being rejected from 
my 
top-choice-since-forever 
school, 

Yale University.

I was a smart kid (4.1 GPA), from a 

great family — my sister is my best friend 
— and participated in so many after-
school activities I now actually slightly 
gag wondering how I did it — rowing 
team, honor societies, piano and French 
horn lessons, Hebrew school, fall play, 
spring musical, community service (my 
role model in life is my high-school self). 
For the first time in my life, after reading 
my Yale rejection letter, I had been told 
what I did was not good enough for 
something I thought I deserved. I had to 
confront the reality that I might not be 
special.

Yes, I know, what a sob story. White-

and-Jewish-girl-from-New-York-is-
not-as-cool-as-she-thought-she-was. 
I completely get that, but, at the same 
time, bite me.

So I had committed to the University, 

and I told myself I was happy. I was, to 
some degree. But it wasn’t Yale. It wasn’t 
Ivy. (Looking back, though, who cares?) 
There was no pivotal moment when I 
decided I had made the right decision 
and that the universe obviously wanted 
me to go to the University over Yale. 
But, looking back, I couldn’t see myself 
anywhere else.

A lot of what I 

have been word-
vomiting across 
The Statement’s 
pages this year is 
directly 
related 

to 
insecurity. 

Insecurity 
that 

maybe I won’t 
achieve 
what 

I 
want, 
and 

insecurity 
that 

I might not be 
successful 
and 

end up leading 
an “average” life. 
And insecurity if 
I am making the 
right 
decisions 

and 
doing 
the 

right things to get 
me going in the 
right direction to 
land me in the right place.

Here’s what the University taught 

me: Insecurity is as common as having 
a nose and two eyes on your face. For the 
most part, people are putting their best 
foot forward in a society that tries to 
hide that one foot behind.

(Don’t worry, Mom and Dad, I learned 

a lot of other things too. For example, I 
learned how to write a 15-page essay the 
night before it’s due and get an A.)

I’m graduating a year early, which is 

thrusting me into the “real world” a full 
365 days earlier than I had planned. A 
lot of this year was me slowly doubting 
myself over and over about every choice 
I’ve made. Why couldn’t I have done 
this essay better? What if I had done 
Michigan in Washington? Do I really 
need to graduate early? Do I even want 
to go to law school? I should have spent 

more time on this job application, why 
didn’t I? Etc.

It was crushing me, suffocating 

me, thinking that I have let go of 
opportunities and that I’m doing 
something wrong. My frenzy manifested 
itself in self-debilitating humorous 
articles and retreating from doing much 
more than homework and Netflix and 
student organization meetings.

I’m not sure why, but I suddenly 

stopped around the beginning of April 
with the “what-ifs” and the “if-thens.” 
Instead, I started with the, “well-nows.” 
Well, now I’m headed to the University 

of 
Edinburgh 

to get a one-
year 
Master’s 

Degree in marine 
systems 
and 

policies. 
Well, 

now I’m studying 
for the LSAT and 
praying to Yeezy 
that I do OK. 
Well, now I am 
just taking things 
in stride.

Why?
Because, I let 

go of this need to 
plan.

Starting with 

my Yale rejection 
— and, arguably, 
starting 
with 

my first Google 
search 
for 

colleges — it was all about planning and 
doing and seeing enough to get me to the 
“next step” on my way to my “next goal.” 
There was always a well-thought-out 
plan between high school and college 
— see my very first Statement column 
about this. Once I let go of my insecurity 
with the lack of plan between college 
and post-graduation, the air has become 
easier to breathe.

I’m not special. That’s the biggest 

lesson I learned here, surrounded by the 
brightest and most passionate people I 
know. I’m not going to necessarily enact 
worldwide change, but I can enact one 
change in one person with a smile. I’m 
not the best, because there’s no true 
definition for what the “best” is. I’m not 
the smartest, because there are different 
types of intelligence.

I am OK with graduating, though. 

And that’s because I am comfortable 
with being uncomfortable. I am OK with 
graduating, because graduation doesn’t 
mean letting go of what you know. 
Graduation just means heading forward 
into an unknown future filled with 
whatever opportunities and possibilities 
you make for yourself.

Congratulations to the class of 2017, 

we got this. Also, send me a text if you 
have an idea about how to decorate my 
graduation cap! OK, thanks!

Meet the Students

Student of the Year Issue

“I loved the people, I think is what first drew 

me to it. … It’s a very specific kind of openness 
you have to have, as a performer.”

It’s the end of the week, and though Megumi 

Nakamura, a sophomore in the University of 
Michigan’s Music, Theatre & Dance School, is 
juggling a packed schedule — she has six hours 
of class on an average day, is currently working 
on two theater productions, is often in rehearsal 
until 12:30 in the morning, works with faculty in 
the School of Music, Theatre & Dance on issues 
of diversity and facilitates workshops for visiting 
elementary school students and middle-school-

ers through the Michigan 
Performance 
Outreach 

Workshop — she’s friendly 
and eager to talk.

This is the kind of open-

ness that, it seems safe to 
say, would be exhaust-
ing to most people. Luck-
ily, Nakamura is not most 
people.

She leans forward as 

she continues speaking, 
spreading her hands in the 
kind of emphatic gesture 
that comes naturally to 
her.

“I started to figure out 

that being a community leader and activist, the-
ater was an incredible outlet for that, and it gave 
me a voice, and it was a way that I understood 
how to give other people a voice, how to tell sto-
ries that I wanted to tell.”

Nakamura is working to share this outlet 

with others through the Michigan Performance 
Outreach Workshop. She joined MPOW, which 
brings students from Detroit-area schools that 
have little or no funding for the arts to the Uni-
versity for a day of performance workshops, as a 
freshman. Through it, she’s able to accomplish 
what she considers to be her overall goal in col-
lege: “to bring back a high level of arts to under-
funded schools like that” and to “spark interest” 
in performance.

She smiles as she describes the kids’ reactions, 

saying, “We do, like, one day of workshops with 
them, and performances, and at the end of the 
day, students walk away being like, ‘I can be an 
actor,’ or like, ‘You know what? I think I’m a good 
actor!’ ”

Involvement in MPOW seems to have been a 

natural path for Nakamura, who grew up attend-
ing public schools in San Rafael, Calif., that also 
had little funding for arts education. After real-
izing her love for the performing arts, she was 
able to find outside resources through the San 
Francisco-based American Conservatory The-
ater, and eventually began providing them for 
others: She started teaching theater as an assis-
tant in high school, and began teaching theater 
and dance on her own after she graduated.

Now, as the incoming vice president of 

MPOW, Nakamura is determined to expand the 
impact of theater as a means of nontraditional 
learning and communicating unvoiced stories 
and experiences. While the organization cur-
rently focuses on fifth-, sixth- and seventh-grade 
kids, she’s hoping to expand it to include high-
schoolers and college-prep-style workshops.

Despite the amount of time and effort she puts 

into the performing arts, she doesn’t get tired of 
it. When asked what her ideal, stress-free situa-
tion is, she laughs and responds: “Probably see-
ing theater, honestly. … That’s kind of the most 
relaxing times I have, to just sit and appreciate 
my classmates and fellow actors and see the 
work people are doing. I think … a lot of the most 

exciting work that happens here comes directly 
from the students — student-directed and stu-
dent-written pieces, because those are the shows 
that are reflecting our current situations.”

Nakamura’s commitment to giving voice to 

relevant stories is one of the primary reasons 
for her involvement in different communities on 
campus. She doesn’t get carried away with her-
self, though — she understands the importance 
of stepping back to assess a situation from the 
outside, a practice that can easily get lost in the 
drive to stand out as a leader on campus.

“Coming here was overwhelming at first 

because … I wanted to be able to connect with 
anyone that I possibly could, and there’s so many 
people here, and so many different identities that 
it’s been a really incredible and challenging pro-
cess to step back and say that, in order for me to 
one day be the leader and activist that I want to 
be, and be someone who … facilitates platforms 
for people to share their voices, their opinions, I 
have to understand those communities first.”

As a leader, Nakamura is able to teach and 

empower, but more importantly, she’s able to 
listen. 

“I know I can help more if I wait and I learn 

from the members of that community and recog-
nize my own ignorance,” Nakamura says.

She places her hands resolutely on the table in 

front of her as she says this. Performance, after 
all, demands a certain amount of receptiveness 
to the audience — and Nakamura’s ready to take 
the stage.

Cancer has closely affected LSA senior Rebec-

ca Ress throughout her life. Her mother has been 
battling colorectal cancer for the past 10 years, 
and she lost her father to lymphoma three days 
before the start of her freshman year. But soon 
after arriving on campus she, at the urging of 
her sorority sisters, became involved with Camp 
Kesem at the University of Michigan.

Camp Kesem at the University is part of a 

national nonprofit of primarily college students 
that organizes free camps for children of adults 
battling cancer. Camp Kesem at the Univer-
sity organizes two one-week camps in August at 
Camp Copneconic in Fenton, and has nearly 100 
student volunteers involved. Ress was drawn to 
the camp, as it was something she wished she had 
when her parents were battling cancer.

“I grew up having two parents who were both 

fighting cancer, and I didn’t have any resource like 
that,” she said. “It was definitely an ostracising 
feeling. So coming to this university, and realizing 
that I had the power to spread this community 
to other children in the area to have that kind of 
community was a no brainer.”

Ress started off her first summer as a coun-

selor, and quickly became more involved, being 
promoted to outreach chair on its coordinating 
board. In that role, she managed camper-family 
relations and reunions, as well as the organization 
of medical staff and information for the camp. She 
now serves as co-director, responsible for all the 
aspects of the camp’s planning and fundraising. 

Ress estimates that it costs $1,000 to send one kid 
to the camp. This summer, the camp will be its 
largest ever, as it is hoping to serve 260 kids. 

While it may be a lot of work, Ress feels that her 

job is incredibly rewarding.

“I like the mission-focused work, and feeling 

that passion,” Ress said. “I spend so much time 
working on Kesem that it doesn’t feel like work 
when you’re working for something that you care 
about that much.”

Ress stresses that Camp Kesem tries to give 

campers as normal a camp experience as possible.

“We say that Camp Kesem isn’t a boo-boo 

camp — it’s not like a cancer camp,” she said. “It’s 
pretty much a regular, crazy, dirty summer camp 
where we’re swimming and on the lake front and 
doing ziplining and messy games and things like 
that.”

However, the camp does dedicate one day of the 

week as an “empowerment day” to help campers 
through their tough times. The day begins with 
counselors and campers alike sharing their own 
stories if they choose, with the goal of empower-
ing themselves and other campers. Ress felt that 
this day was most impactful to her when she was 
helping others prepare their stories.

“My first year I spoke at empowerment, and 

the following years I’ve learned that I find more 
joy in finding others to speak,” Ress said. “So help-
ing other counselors helping campers through 
their stories, and bringing them forward to feel 
the power to share their stories has been really 

meaningful for me.”

Co-directing the camp isn’t the only hat Ress 

wears. She also cares for her mother, who is still 
battling colorectal cancer, as her father has passed 
and her siblings have moved away. She drives an 
hour home to Troy every other weekend or so, to 
make sure her mother isn’t always alone.

“Her chemo is pretty rigorous right now, where 

she can’t always get up and down the stairs or feed 
herself,” Ress said. “Sometimes, I need to take her 
to the hospitals to get IVs or things like that.”

Her mother’s long-term treatments were on 

her 
mind 
even 
as Ress 
was 
choos-
ing 
a 

college. 
Her 
mother 
goes 
through 
a 
new 

round 
of treat-
ments 
about 
every 
year and 
a half to 

keep her cancer under control.

“Coming here, and when I was applying to 

colleges, I definitely had to consider distance to 
home,” she said.

While Ress has faced many obstacles before 

and during her college experience, her experi-
ences with her parents battling cancer and the 
campers she works with have given her a new 
perspective on what it means to have a bad day.

“I tripped and spilled my coffee and it was just 

a typical kind of bad day, and I couldn’t help but 
laugh because I was so grateful to have a silly type 
of bad day.”

Every morning, Keiana Cavé looks in the mir-

ror and tells herself to be a badass. And so far, her 
mantra has worked.

The University of Michigan freshman is a 

member of Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2017 — 
one of the youngest in the Energy category. 

Cavé was recognized for her work surround-

ing the BP oil spill of April 2010, which she start-
ed researching at Tulane University when she 
was 15. Her primary goal was to prove that there 
is something more dangerous about a layer of oil 
sitting on the ocean surface than just pollution 
— the reaction of UV rays from the sun on the oil-
water mixture eventually forms chemicals that 
can cause cancer.

“I started off (in high school) doing four 

sports: ballet, swim, cheer and track,” Cavé said. 
“The last thing on my mind was being in a lab 
24/7 … I didn’t really think much of it — it was 
just a summer. It was cool. They paid me.”

Cavé entered her research in a local science 

fair, and ended up winning, despite her last-
minute poster. She then went on to the 2015 Intel 
International Science and Engineering Fair and 
earned second place out of 2,600 participants. 
As part of Cavé’s award, NASA and the MIT Lin-
coln Laboratory named asteroid “2000 GD136” 
after her. The award gave Cavé confidence about 
the importance of her work and motivated her to 
take it further.

“I had to first show that (these carcinogens) 

actually exist,” Cavé said. “And then once I 
showed that they exist I had to show that they 
are harmful, and then after that I moved into 
finding a solution.”

Before her research, the methods used to 

clean up oil spills weren’t dealing with the car-
cinogens at all. So Cavé invented a carcinogen-
fighting molecule, and turned her research into 
her own business — a startup called Mare. Now 
she is funded by Chevron, which gave her $1.2 

million to continue her research.

“It started off as just the molecule, just the oil 

spill, but now I think the company is more based 
off of the neutralization of toxins,” Cavé said. 
“I’m sure you read articles all the time, if you’re 
ever scrolling through Facebook, and you see 
something that says: ‘Warning! Don’t use your 
deodorant anymore because it will give you can-
cer!’ It can get pretty serious. … We want those 
companies to come to us so that we can neutral-
ize whatever carcinogen is in the product with-
out compromising the integrity of the product.”

But Cavé didn’t originally know how to run 

a business. Last summer, she was the youngest-
ever attendee of the Global Entrepreneurship 
Bootcamp at MIT, where she figured out how to 
translate her complicated research into a com-
prehensible marketing platform. Now, she man-
ages the business, has a team of people working 
for her and personally connects with Mare’s cli-
ents, including Chevron and Brazilian Blowout.

Cavé also holds two patents and has published 

two research papers. Her work with Microsoft 
is further proof of her unparalleled intellect. She 
taught herself HTML at age 8 and worked for 
Microsoft, designing websites for more than a 
year while still in high school.

After receiving a full ride to the University, 

Cavé enrolled in the College of Engineering, 
where she is studying chemical engineering. 
While taking a full course load, Cavé also spends 
many late nights in the lab continuing her 
research. She finds time to be an active member 
of the Entrepreneurs Leadership Program — 
though she admits that she doesn’t sleep much.

In addition to all her scholastic and scien-

tific pursuits, Cavé is a brand representative for 
Lululemon and Francesca’s, advertising their 
clothing through her social media posts. Lulule-
mon reached out to Cavé specifically, but she ini-
tiated the partnership with Francesca’s herself.

“I was on a flight from Miami to (Ann Arbor),” 

Cave said. “And they lost my luggage. I had a 
photoshoot with Humanly magazine … I was 
freaking out. It was all of my favorite stuff.”

“I went into disaster mode. I went to the mall 

and walked into Francesca’s and was like: ‘Look, 
I don’t have any money. The airport lost my stuff. 
I have a photoshoot. Is there anything you guys 
can do? Can you guys dress me?’ And that was 
the start of a relationship. So now, they give me 
stuff every two weeks, whenever they get new 
shipments.”

Francesca’s and Lululemon were not the 

only ones to crave Cavé’s influence, though. Her 
brand of female empowerment has been so pro-
lific that MTV scooped Cavé up to do a short seg-
ment for their “A Woman Did That” campaign. 
The first one-minute bit was so successful that 

the network is planning on having Cavé return 
for a weekly segment.

Cavé has already accomplished more than 

most college graduates, a fact that was noted by 
Congressman Cedric Richmond (D–La.) Feb. 23, 
2016, in his speech to the House of Representa-
tives regarding Cavé’s accomplishments. But 
these days, Cavé is giving her own speeches.

“Oh yeah, I forgot to say, I’m doing a Ted 

Talk in Barcelona on May 4th,” Cavé said. “I’m 
actually going to talk about the power of being 
obnoxious.”

While Cavé attributes her success to “being 

obnoxious,” she pursues everything she does 
with vigor and dedication. That may be abrasive 
to some, but Cavé has single-handedly managed 
to change the world by the age of 19 — and that is 
definitely badass.

Ben Rathi is, first and foremost, an incredibly 

kind person. The friendliness emanating from 
the fifth-year senior from Novi when he walks 
into Espresso Royale is not the oozing or over-
whelming kind, but mild and genuine. And if 
kindness is first, helpfulness is a very close sec-
ond. 

While pursuing two degrees in business and 

computer science, stopping just two classes short 
of a third in biomedical science, Ben has had a 
wealth of prestigious internships at software, 
finance and health care firms; and founded a 
successful, now national-scale, nonprofit orga-
nization that collects unused medical supplies 
and delivers them to impoverished countries for 

a fraction of their market value. He is aware of 
just how successful he already is — whereas oth-
ers might try to downplay their achievements 
for the appearance of humility, he talks comfort-
ably and matter-of-factly. He does not hold any 
illusions about his success either — he knows he 
owes it to much more than just himself.

“I started calculating, and I swear this was 

in 5th grade, but I was like, ‘All right, there are 7 
billion people in the world,’ income distribution, 
looked at some statistics, all that, and I was like, 
‘There are probably 6 billion people in the world 
who would do anything to have the opportuni-
ties I have,’ “ he tells me.

That gratitude, he says, is what gives him the 

motivation to stay in and work on a Friday night, 
to the extent that his peers think of him as “the 
crazy business kid” or “a machine,” and what 
gives him his desire to help. Though business is 
his main passion now, coming into college, Ben 
planned to help people by becoming a doctor. 
After completing his freshman year, he decided 
to volunteer in a Nepalese hospital for a month.

“I told myself, ‘All right, if you want to be a 

doctor, it’s one thing to do it at a nice hospital 
like Michigan or Northwestern, it’s another 
thing to feel true depravity and poverty, and 
witness people who might not have much 
going for them,’ “ he says. The hospital he went 
to, he told me, though it was one of the best in 
the country, suffered hours-long E.R. waiting 
times because of understaffing and underfund-
ing. Patients had to share beds and would often 
leave sicker than they came in from a disease 
another patient had given them. Simple medi-
cal supplies such as gloves and bedsheets had to 
be reused. Working at a hospital back in Novi, 
though, restocking shelves, he witnessed a very 
different situation, in which unused supplies 
were thrown out because of expiration dates. 
As well as wanting to have a broader under-
standing of the world, Ben says seeing the inef-
ficiencies of the medical industry is what led 
him to leave it for business.

“End goal, I would love to influence policy 

change, but I’m not delusional and it’s tough 
to lobby against the medical industry,” he 
says. “So while the waste is happening, I was 
thinking, ‘Is there a way to bridge the gap?’ “

As it turns out, there was. In his sophomore 

year, Ben founded Blueprints For Pangaea, a 

501(c)(3) nonprofit, with more than $25,000 
in prize money from several business compe-
titions. The business, which has now expand-
ed to nine other colleges and universities, has 
a model that is quite sustainable. If it can get 
the technically expired medical supplies for 
$5,000, and their value is $1,000,000, he says, 
governments would be happy to pay $6,000.

Weeks away from graduation, and hav-

ing left Blueprints For Pangaea safely in the 
hands of the next generation of students, 
Ben’s new dream is venture capitalism.

“When you’re in a startup, you have to 

commit all your time and effort and energy 
into that one startup, and so while I was doing 
Blueprints, a lot of cool opportunities came 
my way, but I was committed to Blueprints,” 
he says. “With VC you get to participate in 
multiple startups. You’re on the cutting edge 
of technology. And if you couldn’t tell, my life 
dream is just … to accelerate our ascent into 
the future, I guess, because I think technol-
ogy can improve everyone’s life, in an egali-
tarian way.”

If he had to distill his story into one word, 

though, it would be efficiency.

“Academically, I was learning about effi-

ciency on a microscale in CS, right — ‘How 
do you get 0.1 seconds faster in the code?’ On 
a macrolevel in business — ‘How does Tesla 
create a cheaper battery?’ So I’ve been study-
ing efficiency all my life, and I’d like to con-
tinue that.”

So while it may seem like a technical word, 

to Ben, it’s just another way of practicing 
kindness.

Antara Afrin’s small stature belies her ambi-

tious dreams. A mentor and role model to 
aspiring doctors from underrepresented back-
grounds, she plans to make medicine more 
accessible to people like her in the United States.

Antara is the undergraduate president of the 

University of Michigan Medical School’s Doc-
tors of Tomorrow, a program that sparks interest 
in underrepresented minority students in health 
fields and provides the resources students need 
to be successful in pursuing medical careers. 
Antara currently tutors public school students 
in Detroit.

Antara’s involvement with DoT started in 

2012, her senior year of high school, when it 
was established by Jonathan Finks, the Medical 
School’s associate professor of surgery. Though 
it was intended only for freshmen back in the 
day, Antara was nevertheless encouraged to 
attend events by Finks, whom she considers one 
of her role models.

“I feel like, as a student coming from the city 

of Detroit, I definitely had experiences with peo-
ple (who) as soon they find out I’m from Detroit, 
they probably are like … ‘Do you want to go to X 
career instead of medicine?’ ” Antara said. “Dr. 
Finks is one of those people who’s just like, ‘You 
want to be a doctor? You’re going to be a doctor. 
And I’m going to help you in any way possible to 
make sure you’re a doctor.’ ”

Antara took such a liking to DoT that she 

opted to join as an undergraduate representative 
at the University. During her sophomore year, 
she realized the DoT program only mentored 
freshmen and did not follow up with them.

“We work with these ninth graders, but then 

we just let them go,” Antara said. “That’s not how 
this pipeline from high school to medical school 
should work … we can’t just stop midway.”

To alleviate this problem, Antara created 

DoT Rising, which continues to mentor students 

throughout high school. This year, eight of the 
first DoT students who were freshmen in 2012 
enrolled as freshman at the University.

“It’s amazing because these students, I’ve 

seen them when I was a senior in high school,” 
Antara said. “And now to see them as a senior 
at UM … I see them all involved and doing great 
things on campus already, it makes me happy.”

Antara also started DoT Succeed, which 

encourages those who benefit from the pro-
gram in high school to teach high schoolers once 
they’re in college.

As a graduate of Cass Technical High School 

in Detroit, Antara works on a daily basis to bridge 
the gap between the high schoolers and Medical 
School students who participate in DoT. She ref-
erenced several instances in which her experi-
ence as a former Cass student provided her with 
an important perspective some of the medical 
students who participate in the program lacked.

“We were planning our end-of-the-year event, 

and at first someone was like, ‘We should proba-
bly hold it on a weekday,’ ” Antara recalled. “And 
I was like, ‘if we want parents there we can’t hold 
it on a weekday because a lot our students, their 
parents work jobs in manufacturing … if you’re 
coming from a lower-income background, you 
don’t want your parents to have to take off a day 
off for you and to have that pressure, so I was 
able to say no.”

Despite her large presence in the organi-

zation, Antara remains a humble figure. She 
explained that she prefers an inclusive environ-
ment in which everyone’s opinion is carefully 
considered, especially those who may not be 
inclined to speak in public.

“Usually when you lay down a problem the 

first person to answer will be the really extro-
verted, really outgoing person who answers the 
question,” Antara said. “However, you’ll have the 
greatest ideas in a person who’s really quiet.”

Antara’s Islamic faith and commitment to 

social justice guide her through life. Her mother 
always told her that she must expand her bound-
aries and discover knowledge, as that is what the 
Quran encourages all Muslims to do.

“It’s funny because when people see that I’m 

Muslim-American, they immediately assume, 
‘Oh, she’s oppressed,’ ” Antara said. “But then 
I’m like, ‘No, I aspire to these goals because I feel 
like that’s what my religion tells me. My religion 
tells me to help others and it tells me to be more 
knowledgeable.’ ”

In the future, Antara plans to establish a net-

work of medical clinics in underserved areas 
that take into account the social and cultural 
needs of the community. For example, a clinic in 
a predominantly Muslim area where physicians 
and nurses know what to expect during the fast-

ing season of Ramadan. Antara explained that 
minorities and immigrants have been under-
served throughout the history of the United 
States, and it’s about time that their needs are 
being met too.

“I don’t want to just be the friendly neighbor-

hood physician,” Antara said. “I also want to be 
a leader in medicine … I just don’t want to serve 
just one patient, I want to serve a community.”

Antara is enrolling in a supply-chain man-

agement MBA program at Michigan State 
University starting in August to learn how to 
open the clinics, then plans to obtain her MD. 
She hopes to continue being a figure students 
from underrepresented groups can follow 
and identify with.

“I just want to let them know that they’re 

just as capable,” she said.

The images, by now, are familiar. A baby washed 

ashore a beach. A young boy shellshocked by mor-
tar fire. Streams of mothers and children and grief-
stricken fathers, displaced from their homes, and 
fleeing what many now call the worst humanitarian 
disaster of our time.

For most students, the global refugee crisis is all 

at once pressing and overwhelming, both ubiquitous 
and distant. The victories of protest and demonstra-
tion can feel short-lived, especially when placed 
against a backdrop of geopolitical chaos on two dif-
ferent continents and a federal administration plac-
ing restrictions on refugees’ entry into the country.

LSA senior Nicole Khamis also watched the 

vicious cycle of election season rhetoric around 
refugee resettlement whirl last summer, but the 
scenes of tragedy were more than just sobering to 
her. Working at an international nonprofit in Jor-
dan, being a daughter of Palestinian refugees and 
hailing from a family full of asylum seekers, Khamis 
saw herself.

“These people are traces of who I am,” she said. 

“Or could have been. I couldn’t walk away.”

And thus, the Michigan Refugee Assistance 

Program was born.

In its first year on campus, MRAP has held 

nearly a dozen teach-ins, fundraising drives 
totaling $5,000, and held a refugee panel cap-
stone event, all with a board operating at full 
capacity and membership base of close to 100 
students.

The group’s most pivotal achievement, 

though, isn’t quite quantifiable. One hundred 
sixty-three refugees moved into Washtenaw 
County last year, and resettlement agencies 

expect that number to double in the 2017 fiscal year. 
By connecting students to volunteer opportunities 
with families themselves and state advocacy efforts, 
MRAP — under Khamis’ leadership — has succeed-
ed in reframing the refugee crisis as an urgent, local 
priority.

Last summer, she quipped, was “the perfect 

storm.” Khamis was halfway through her intern-
ship at the State Department when the idea of a 
refugee advocacy group on campus came to her, 
and she wasted no time in roping in seasoned stu-
dent organizers to back her fledgling project. She 
noted both the state of Michigan — with one of the 
highest resettlement rates of Syrian refugees in the 
country — and the University of Michigan — with 
an untapped pool of more than 50,000 diverse stu-
dents, faculty and staff and storied history of activ-
ism — represented the ideal site for MRAP’s mission.

Jewish Family Services, a local resettlement 

agency, was also eager to replenish its depleted 
volunteer force, and quickly signed on. Still, the 
night before the group’s Facebook launch, Khamis 
couldn’t sleep.

“I was so nervous,” she said. “I thought no one 

would sign up, or that it wouldn’t last.”

More than 200 people applied to volunteer with-

in MRAP’s first month of existence.

Today, MRAP has carved out a niche on campus, 

and is even regarded by external organizations as 
one of the most reliable sources of volunteers in the 
area. Khamis worked with a contact in the Detroit 
Mayor’s Office to form a pilot partnership with the 
city’s refugee housing program run by its Office 
of Immigrant Affairs. Groups of trained students, 
accompanied by a translator, travel each week to 
meet with refugee families and act as welcoming 
liaisons. These sessions in cultural orientation can 
include anything from trips to the grocery store to 
filling out tax forms. This summer, Khamis will be 
working with the DMO to bring the program to 
other universities.

When asked about her favorite memory with 

MRAP, Khamis immediately smiled.

“The best moment (was) getting the address 

for my own family,” she recounted. “I remember 
parking the car and seeing their house and it was 
just a plain, small, white house in Detroit. Nothing 
would’ve told you that there was a recently resettled 
refugee family from Syria in there. I remember 
walking up and being scared of offending them … 
or their dignity … I was nervous. And that moment, 
that two-second interval where I knocked on the 
door and waited, was really filled with anxiety for 
me. Then they opened the door. And immediately, 
they were like, ‘Oh my gosh, come in,’ and just com-
pletely accepted me with open arms. We ended up 
talking for, like, six hours.”

These human interactions are at the core of Kha-

mis’s vision, and compose much of MRAP’s strat-

egy of proximity and reciprocity. The families, she 
explained, benefit from the network of relationships 
and knowledge volunteers offer, while students 
become more actively engaged in breaking down 
stereotypes about refugees.

“We’re one of the only student organizations 

working with families directly and advocating with 
empathy,” she said. “What we’ve done really well is 
to channel students’ energy and desire to be on the 
right side of things. We make sure they’re doing 
work, but always with the right intentions.”

As Khamis looks toward graduation and her 

upcoming Fulbright program in Jordan next year, 
she highlighted the magnitude and sustainability of 
MRAP as critical developments.

“This work is heavy,” she said. “And I took on 

a lot of it … but this has to live on. There are still 
people here that need our help. There’s an ebb 
and flow in any organization, but the mission 
stays.”

Khamis credited MRAP as the catalyst in her 

journey “coming full circle” at the University: 
She knows now to leverage her own identity to 
connect with, and uplift, those with less privi-
lege.

“I learned to make good on the opportunities 

I have,” she said. “We’re undoing a paralysis this 
year, and I’ve seen so much faith and resilience in 
the face of impossibility.”

Other images, now, are familiar to Khamis. 

Rooms crowded with students, faculty, and staff 
diligently taking notes on the resettlement pro-
cess. Trips to Washington, D.C., and the United 
Nations to present MRAP’s model of a student 
movement. And a pot of tea, shared on a cold 
winter day, in a family’s new home.

“I had a meeting with Dan Gilbert the 

second day (of my internship) — I think we 
were talking about one of his developments — 
and he calls me out and says, ‘You’re the girl 
whose family owns Dutch Girl!’ And I was 
like, ‘Yes, sir, that’s me.’ And he stole my note-
book and he stole my pen and started making 
a map, and he was like, ‘This is your doughnut 
shop, this is where my dad’s bar was and we 
used to go over there all the time!’ He called 
me Doughnut Girl all summer.”

Though she may be “Doughnut Girl” to 

Detroit billionaire and philanthropist Dan 
Gilbert, most people know the Ross School of 
Business sophomore as Arrie Timmer — an 
enthusiastic and entrepreneurial spirit who 
is looking to do big things in and for the city 
of Detroit.

As Gilbert noted, Timmer’s family owns 

Dutch Girl Donuts, a Detroit doughnut staple. 
Her grandparents opened the shop when they 
moved here in 1946, and it’s been in the fam-
ily ever since. As Timmer grew up, Dutch Girl 
shaped her childhood.

“On Fridays, my dad would have me go 

with him downtown to the store and work 
until midnight, and then I would sleep in 
the back room,” she said. “I had a sleeping 
bag and I would sleep on top of flour sacks. 
It wasn’t anything special — I was 10 and it 
was just cleaning — but it was cool to have a 
job, and have responsibilities.”

Timmer also credits the shop with bring-

ing her closer to the city. Many of Dutch 
Girl’s employees have worked there since 
before she was born, and growing up with 
them allowed her to see the city through 
their eyes.

It was a love for her family business and 

for Detroit that brought Timmer to the Busi-
ness School. She’s seen the good that busi-
ness can do, and is determined to use it as a 
way to change people’s lives for the better.

“Growing up with entrepreneurs as fam-

ily members, it gave me a lot of respect for 
business, and the ways they can be used to 
support communities and drive change and 
growth in cities,” she said. “I’ve seen how 
our family business, even though it’s small, 
has changed other people’s lives.”

And, of course, because entrepreneurship 

seems to flow through Timmer’s veins, she 
is helping to grow and start several projects 
at Michigan that aren’t directly related to 
Detroit, too. As a survivor of sexual assault, 
she helped to expand the Panhellenic Peer 
Education Program last year, which teaches 
girls in Greek life about issues of sexual vio-
lence and fosters a community of support 
among them. She also is working to start a 
magazine with her friends next fall that will 
publish the writing and artwork of college-
aged women.

“I was just tired of having old men say, 

‘Your work is not good enough to be pub-
lished,’ ” she said.

Between her school work and extracur-

ricular projects and helping out at Dutch 
Girl — the whole family still goes back to 
work Fat Tuesday every year — Timmer 
found time last summer to put her passions 
to work as an intern for Rock Ventures, Dan 
Gilbert’s Detroit-based firm that is helping 
to revitalize the city in enormous ways.

Though some people criticize the way Gil-

bert is working in the city, Timmer sings his 
praises.

“He’s very passionate about what he does 

and he’s very passionate about making a dif-
ference. People think of him as this monarch 
who’s taking over the city and isn’t doing it 
mindfully, but he has teams and teams of 
people who make sure that his work is mind-
ful of the city’s existing residents and mind-
ful of what will bring people into the city.”

As an intern, she worked on projects such 

as Rehabbed and Ready, which works in 
partnership with the Detroit Land Bank to 
remodel houses and resell them to Detroit 
citizens, and Build Institute, which supports 
and educates young entrepreneurs in South-
west Detroit.

“I’ve wanted to work for (Gilbert) since I 

was in high school,” Timmer said. “I came in 
to last summer thinking that I just wanted 
to be involved in some way, and now I think 

my main goal at the University of Michigan 
and in my career is to develop myself into 
being the best asset for Detroit as possible … 
so I can be dropped into anything and make 
myself as useful as possible.”

In her future, Timmer said, she can see 

herself taking over Dutch Girl — though 
she’s nervous about living up to the stan-
dard her parents and grandparents have set. 
Whatever she ends up doing, she knows her 
path will lead her back to Detroit at some 
point, and she’s eager to make a difference 
in any way she can.

As for this summer, Timmer’s plans are 

still in the air, but she’s looking for projects 
that will allow her to get even more hands-
on in the city. And, of course, she’ll be work-
ing at the doughnut shop.

During her senior year of high school, Reid 

Depowski took her first college-level psychology 
class. She fell in love with the subject. This same 
year she lost her mother to suicide. 

“This was a really pivotal moment in my life, 

in realizing such an important moment of men-
tal health, despair and seeing the opportunities 
my mother didn’t have for her mental health,” 
Depowski, who is now an LSA senior, said. “And 
so, this was kind of a snowball effect — I was 
already getting so interested in psychology and 
mental health.”

After this, Depowski became involved with the 

American Foundation of Suicide Prevention as a 
volunteer. Her developing passion for psychol-
ogy continued when she enrolled at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, where she joined Active Minds 

and CAPS in 
Action — both 
organizations 
that 
promote 

mental 
health 

awareness.

As 
part 
of 

the 
national 

organization, 
Depowski helps 
plan expert pan-
els for Active 
Minds. 
For 

instance, 
she’s 

brought experts 
to campus to 
discuss 
eating 

disorders. The aim here, she explains, is 
to break down myths and provide real 

answers about mental health.

CAPS in Action is a student group partnered 

with the University of Michigan’s Counseling 
And Psychological Services that spreads the 
word of the psychological work on campus. One 
such project she is working on is a video fea-
turing the stories of campus leaders who have 
struggled with mental health in an effort to des-
tigmatize depression or mental illness.

It was with AFSP, however, that Depow-

ski found personal connections with those who 
faced similar struggles.

“I have met people who have scary simi-

larities to my story,” she said. “People who have 
been through the exact same thing I have, down 
to the details. It can feel very isolating to have 
gone through this loss that some people gasp at. 

So when you meet another individual who has 
gone through the same thing you have, it is, like, 
a burden lifted off of you. Like, someone gets it. 
Someone knows. … The connection you make 
with other suicide loss survivors, it’s priceless.”

One of AFSP’s largest events is the Out of the 

Darkness Walk, an event promoting suicide pre-
vention. After helping to plan her home county’s 
walk, Depowski realized she could bring the first 
Out of the Darkness Walk to the University — 
which came to Ann Arbor on April 9.

“I was like, ‘This is possible. I know I could 

make this happen,’ ” she said.

It was a quick turnover — planning with 

the Michigan chair of AFSP in early Decem-
ber, Depowski went through the heavy 
paperwork process to secure a walk in Nich-
ols Arboretum.

Four hundred walkers participated in the 

event, which raised $28,000 — half of which 
will fund the University’s mental health 
resources. Depowski’s committee decides 
where those funds will be allocated.

Depowski explained that sometimes it 

could be hard, intimidating even, to tackle 
mental health since it was so encompassing 
on campus and required everyone — stu-
dents, professors and administration alike — 
to be on board.

“Sadness, in American culture, is seen as a 

weakness. ‘You’re not sad, you’re not special’ 
sort of thing,” she said. “Specifically in suicide 
culture, something I am so passionate about, 
is that suicide is not really a choice for people. 
It’s not something they do to burden others. 
It’s not something people do out of revenge, 

it’s not something people do for attention.”

Depowski also found comfort outside of 

the academic and activist realm. Despite 
being disconnected from her father after her 
mother’s passing, she has found a home with 
her aunt.

“She has become my closest family mem-

ber besides my sister,” she said. “Our connec-
tion has blossomed since the loss of my mom. 
… My mom’s family is very small, so having 
my aunt, my sister and, of course, my grand-
parents in conjunction to an entire family 
who has loved me and accepted me as their 
own has been very healing to me and has 
helped work me through a lot of this grief I 
experienced.”

As for the future, Depowski has been 

accepted to the University’s School of Social 
Work, where she hopes to become a licensed 
clinical social worker. While she plans to stay 
involved with her organization, Depowski 
views this next part of her life as the biggest 
step to her goals.

“It feels like I am finally entering the stage 

in my life where I am going to make these 
changes happen for other people,” she said. 
“I have benefitted so much from talk-therapy 
that I want to bring that to other people.”

Ultimately, Depowski believes she owes 

much of her drive to her mother.

“My mother really encouraged me in 

school,” she said. “I owe so much of who I 
am today to her. She was not a mental health 
advocate, but she gave me a lot of her spirit 
and fight to make these things happen — to 
find the motivation to do this type of work.”
