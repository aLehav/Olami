The 58th Ann Arbor fair cultivates creativity, culture

Art Fair celebrates, connects artists and their audience

Construction paused on 
South University to make 

way for art vendors

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

The annual Ann Arbor Art Fair will 

take place this Thursday through Sunday 
across several city streets and sidewalks, 
looking to draw in students, residents and 

artists from around the world. The event 
— now in its 58th year — is a collabora-
tion among four smaller fairs: The Guild’s 
Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair, State Street 
Art Fair, Ann Arbor South University Art 
Fair and Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The 
Original.

The event covers 29 city blocks in down-

town Ann Arbor and serves as the larg-
est outdoor juried Art Fair in the nation. 
Pertinent to this year’s fair are the State 
Street Art Fair’s semicentennial, as well 
as the pausing of construction on South 

University Avenue. 

Karen Delhey, spokeswoman for the 

fairs and the executive director of the 
Guild of Artists & Artisans, which over-
sees one fair, said the fair is unique each 
year by nature.

“What we always say is that the Ann 

Arbor Art Fair is never the same twice, 
it’s different from year to year,” she said. 
“Yes, you’re going to always come out and 
see quality art, but the artists are dif-
ferent year after year, as is the artwork. 
You’ll have some new artists, you’ll have 

some returning artists that have new art-
work. What we try and emphasize with 
this event, which is focused on the art, is 
that the art is what’s new, year after year.”

Last year’s fair was the first time the 

fair ran Thursday to Sunday instead of 
Wednesday to Saturday; the change will 
persist this year. 

“Back in the ’60s when the fair start-

ed, times were very different, things 
weren’t open on Sunday, there were a lot 
more women that stayed home during 
the week, so it was easier for them to get 

Local artist and 

University student discuss 

the upcoming event

By WILL STEWART

Summer Managing Arts Editor

From July 20-23, hundreds of thousands 

will flock to Ann Arbor for the 58th annual 
Street Art Fair. After 57 years, the Fair has 

expanded into four concurrent events — The 
Ann Arbor Street Art Fair (The Original), 
Ann Arbor State Street Art Fair, Ann Arbor 
Summer Art Fair and Ann Arbor South Uni-
versity Art Fair — all located around Central 
Campus and downtown. It’s one of the busiest 
and most energetic weekends in the city, even 
rivaling football Saturdays in terms of crowd 
size.

The Art Fair celebrates the intricate rela-

tionship between artists and their audience. 
In a phone interview with the Daily, Bloom-

field Hills-based artist Lisa Farris described 
her fondness for outdoor art fairs.

“It feels more accessible in a way that gal-

leries don’t,” Farris said. I think a lot of people 
come to an art fair for the fun of it, and they 
end up buying pieces that they like and want 
to have in their home. And these same people 
may never feel comfortable going to a gallery.”

“An art fair isn’t intimidating. You’re actu-

ally talking to an artist, there are other activi-
ties, there’s food… it’s like a big party,” she 
said. “To get the actual work done, I spend so 

much time just isolated. So to finally come out 
and have your work out there and have people 
react to it is really invigorating.”

Farris, a graduate of the University of 

Michigan, earned a dual degree in Fine Arts 
and Honors English and speaks fondly of her 
experience in the Stamps School of Art and 
Design: “The professors were amazing. The 
school itself, like the student body, was so sup-
portive of each other’s work — it was a great 
four years.”

Although her education was focused in

Bautista received 

work permit in years 
following husband’s 

deportation

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

On Tuesday evening, hundreds 

gathered to protest the deporta-
tion of Lourdes Salazar Bautista — a 
local mother with three U.S.-born 
children — in Ann Arbor. The event 
began with a vigil at St. Mary’s Stu-
dent Parish before marching to the 
Federal Building on Liberty Street. 

Bautista was born in Mexico but 

moved to the United States with her 
husband in 1997. She was detained 
by U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement in 2011 but traded plac-
es with her husband, who was then 
deported.

The Washtenaw Interfaith Coali-

tion for Immigration Rights, St. 
Mary’s Student Parish and affiliated 
community members launched the 
Lucha por Lourdes campaign, ask-
ing Detroit ICE Director Rebecca 

Adducci to grant Bautista stay in her 
community. “Lucha” means “fight” 
in Spanish.

The event was held in both Span-

ish and English. 

In a translated interview, Bautista 

said she was grateful to have such 
strong support from the community.

“I feel very strong,” Bautista said. 

“I feel very full in my faith, and I feel 
strong to move forward and fight for 
my children.”

Rackham student Luz Meza, who 

attends St. Mary’s, joined the cam-
paign as the primary media contact.

“A lot of community members 

came onto the campaign knowing 
Lourdes for such a long time,” she 
said. “We came together — a core 
group of four of us — and a very large 
group of amazing volunteers and 
organizers who are doing a lot of the 
legwork for this campaign.”

Meza said Bautista’s request to 

stay in the United States is not abnor-
mal; it has been granted over the past 
several years and was expected to 
be granted this year, as she has chil-
dren.

“The 
priorities 
of 
ICE 
has 

changed with the new administra-
tion — where before they were using 

their discretion to grant stay to fami-
lies where the family was very con-
nected to the community and they 
have children, and on top of all of it, 
the possibility of eventually obtain-
ing a legal status through her chil-
dren,” she said. “There has been a 
change in the way that things have 
been running, although it is true that 
Director Adduci still has the power 
to grant her to stay. It’s not an issue 
of, (Adduci) has been instructed not 

to; it is, she has the power and she’s 
choosing to go in a route that is 
more favorable for the followers of 
the current administration.”

Attendees partook in prayers 

and moments of silence in support 
of Bautista. They also lit candles in 
her honor.

Bautista addressed the crowd, 

expressing 
gratitude 
for 
the 

immense community support. Her 
words were translated to English. 
Bautista then told her story — her 
husband’s deportation and how it 
has affected her and her three chil-
dren.

“I am the mother of three kids 

who thank God they have been 
born in this country,” she said. “I 
(had) a normal life just like you did 
until 2010.”

Bautista said she spent 23 days 

in jail.

“I was told I could remain in this 

country with my children but that 
my husband had to go,” she said. “I 
was only able to see my husband to 
say goodbye.”

Since then, Bautista said she has 

checked in with the ICE each year 
since they granted her the ability 
to stay on a work permit. However, 
this March, she was denied stay 

and is set to be deported August 2.

“Immigration has given me a 

work permit that has been renewed 
year by year, until March of this 
year,” she said. “When I went to my 
appointment, I was told it’s the deci-
sion of the new president. They had 
to clean up all the archives… I have to 
leave the country.”

Bautista noted she never had a 

criminal record, nor is she a threat to 
the country; she plays the role of both 
a mother and a father to her children. 
She said she wants them to have a 
better future.

“I’m fighting,” she said. “I’m 

bringing my kids up, I’m shaping 
them, I want to have the chance to 
continue guiding them and educat-
ing them so they can reach a future, 
since I come from a very humble 
environment where I was not able 
to reach anything like this. I want 
to shape them so my kids are good 
members of the community in the 
future.”

Bautista said such circumstances 

were not unique to her, but others as 
well.

“I want to speak out, not just for 

me and my family, but for people that 
I know, for members of my family,” 
she said. “We are here because we 
are seeking a better future, because 
we are here to work.”

After the vigil, attendees made 

their way down State Street toward 
Liberty Street, chanting and car-
rying signs in support of Bautista. 
Signs read “Keep families together” 
and “Lucha Por Lourdes.”

Marchers stopped outside the 

Federal Building on Liberty Street.

State lawmakers condemn GOP health care 
efforts, advocate for Planned Parenthood

State senator 

Rebekah Warren 

warns against 

defunding women’s 
health initiatives

By DYLAN LACROIX

Summer Daily News Editor

State Sen. Rebekah Warren (D–

Ann Arbor) and state Rep. Ronnie 
Peterson (D–Ypsilanti) spoke at 
the Riverside Art Center in down-
town Ypsilanti to over 40 people 
on behalf of Planned Parenthood 
Advocates of Michigan’s third 
and final Field Hearing Monday 
night. They discussed the cur-
rent battle against the Republican 
health care bill in the Senate and 
its effects on women’s health if 
passed.

Warren’s speech, which fol-

lowed a brief informational ses-
sion by Emily Clancy, Planned 
Parenthood Advocate organizer, 
weighed in on how she believes 
Democrats have depended too 
long on the federal backstep of 

the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court 
ruling to protect and defend legal 
abortions, forcing the GOP to 
depend on states to funnel their 
own anti-abortion legislation.

“The states have really become 

incubators, kind of laboratories, 
of anti-choice legislation,” War-
ren said. “We haven’t worried that 
much, as much as probably we 
should have, because we have Roe 
v. Wade, and we know that it laid 
out some really important tenants 
that we thought were there to pro-
tect us for a very long time.”

In reference to the state of 

Michigan’s 
Informed 
Consent 

for Abortion law created in 1993 
— which requires women to have 
certain information be made 
available for at least 24 hours 
prior to undergoing abortion 
procedures — she discussed the 
increasing amount of legislative 
efforts passed by the GOP mak-
ing it more difficult for women to 
have access to an abortion.

“I think, as women, this is one 

of the most insulting pieces of 
legislation we have on the books,” 
Warren said. “I don’t know any 
woman who has ever found her-
self, even for a moment, in the 

event she might have an unin-
tended pregnancy, who doesn’t 
put a lot of thought into what the 
outcomes of that might be.”

Since the recent movement 

to defund Planned Parenthood, 
Warren also spoke about the 
importance of spreading trans-
parency about misconceptions 
of Medicaid-funded abortions in 
Michigan where, since the Hyde 
Amendment of 1988, Michigan 
has bannedthe use of federal 

Medicaid funds towards abor-
tions except for instances of rape 
and incest.

“Planned Parenthood does zero 

abortions in this state with feder-
al money,” Warren said. “The only 
abortions that can be funded with 
state Medicaid money right now 
are just in the category of rape and 
incest.”

to the event,” Delhey said. “As 
times have changed, we felt it was 
important to have that accessi-
bility on a Sunday, so we moved 
it over so that more people could 
get here on the weekend.”

Maureen Riley, the executive 

director of the Ann Arbor Street 
Art Fair, The Original, said there 
was bad weather on the Sunday 
last year and so event contribu-
tors did not see the results it 
had hoped for; still, according to 
Riley, it was the right decision. 

“Everyone has told us they are 

thrilled we made the move,” she 
said. 

In terms of coordinating the 

event, each group curates their 
show separately but work jointly 
on marketing, sponsorships and 
city services. 

“We all take applications from 

artists and then go through a 
juried process, so they’re scored 
and then we pick who comes into 

the show based on their score, in 
a nutshell,” Dehley said. “Each 
show indepently does that — 
they have different standards 
that they look for when they’re 
jurying their show. You’re pretty 
much going to see, they’re all jur-
ied art fairs; so you’re going to see 
high-quality 
work 
throughout 

the entire event.”

A lot of the differences, how-

ever, depend on the missions of 
the organizations running them. 
The State Street Art Fair and the 
South University Art Fair, for 
example, are run by area associa-
tions, so the fairs serve as fund-
raisers for the association. The 
goal of the Guild is to provide 
marketing opportunities for art-
ists. The Ann Arbor Street Art 
Fair, The Original is organized by 
a nonprofit that aims to bring art 
and culture in the community. 

“You’ll see very similar art 

throughout the whole event — 
more of the difference lies behind 
the scenes,” Delhey said.

Each fair has a featured art-

ist whose work is displayed on 

T-shirts and posters; generally 
that artist is picked the year prior.

Sarah Goodyear, a painter from 

North Carolina, is The Guild’s fea-
tured artist. Her piece, entitled 
“Rage Louise,” features a woman 
who appears to be screaming.

“It’s awesome,” Delhey said. 

“It’s a really interesting piece, 
and we’re excited about it this 
year. It’s her first time doing the 
fair.”

Frances Todoro is the execu-

tive director of the State Street 
District, which oversees the State 
Street Art Fair, now celebrat-
ing its 50th year. Todoro noted 
the importance of the historical 
aspect of the fair. 

“Back in the days of (bargain-

ing) when the local businesses 
would come outside for sidewalk 
sales … it kind of built into an art 
fair,” she said. “Over the 50 years, 
providing that extra income or 
that economic catalyst has been 
huge in kind of forming the qual-
ity of our neighborhood and who 
we are.”

Furthermore, 
Todoro 
said 

what sets the State Street Art Fair 
apart is its “eclectic feel.”

“We mix artists with the local 

businesses and the local mem-
bers,” she said. “You could be 
walking down the street and have 
a fine artist and then you have 
(the shop) Orchid Lane, then you 
have more art, and then you have 
Knight’s (restaurant).”

The State Street Art Fair’s 

featured artist is Andy Anh Ha, 
a mixed-media painter from Los 
Angeles . 

“He just did an amazing job,” 

Todoro said. “We did do T-shirts 
with his art on it, a poster, which 
is hanging around the district, in 
our local businesses.”

For its 50th year, however, 

Todoro said the fair has worked 
with a local artist — referred 
to as the district artist — Tim 
Gralewski, who did a piece spe-
cific to the district. The work 
will remain in the district after 
the fair.

Ann Arbor Mayor Chris Taylor 
addressed the crowd, speaking in 
support of Bautista and immigrants 
in the community.

“On days like today, I am so proud 

to be in Ann Arbor,” he said. “I am so 
proud of our commitment to the val-
ues of pluralism and compassion. So 
devoted are we to sharing burdens 
and speaking out in the presence of 
injustice and wrong. We live, in the 
end, in an imperfect but great coun-
try.”

Taylor said for some, their ances-

tors have been in the country for 
millennia, some were brought in 
bondage and many came as refugees, 
who chose the United States to seek a 
better life.

“All these brave souls ever wanted 

was the ability to build and realize a 
dream,” he said.

Taylor said Bautista’s deportation 

would not benefit the United States in 
any way, and that the mere act com-
municates weakness.

“Lourdes’s threatened deporta-

tion is a breach of faith and a dis-
grace,” he said. “It would not make 
America safer, or protect Ameri-
can jobs. All it will do is devastate 
an already-separated family and 
impoverish a community that val-
ues her… What kind of culture are 
we if we deport hard-working par-
ents?”

Taylor called on the community 

to do everything possible to keep 
Bautista’s family together.

“Finally, it is up to us to do 

everything we can to tell the world 
that Trump is not America,” he 
said.

Ypsilanti 
resident 
Karina 

Valle, mother to a young son, also 
addressed the crowd — her hus-
band Jose Valle-Rodriguez has 
been detained by ICE for over a 
month.

Years ago, ICE stopped Valle-

Rodriguez in a vehicle and told 
him he would need to go to court, 
but according to Valle, he never 
received a court date or informa-
tion about a hearing. On May 24, 
ICE officers stopped Valle-Rodri-
guez and his family in their vehi-
cle.

“The first thing (my husband) did 

was look back at his son and say, ‘I’m 
sorry,’ ” she said. “He was pulled 
out of the car. My son started going 
crazy, crying, because he saw that 
they were pulling his dad out of the 
car. I didn’t know what to do.”

MULLINGS

Unpopular opinion

I 

pride myself on “keeping it 
real” or “telling it like it is.” As 
expected, it can occasionally 

get 
me 
into 

trouble. 
Or 

sometimes, my 
realism 
and 

formulations 
may be altered 
in an attempt to morph my 
thoughts into what people want to 
hear … or maybe what they consider 
easier to handle. That being said, I 
am making the executive decision 
to keep it real regarding the topic I 
am about to discuss in an attempt 
to offer a fresh perspective and 
dialogue. Just a little food for 
thought. Hopefully I do not find 
myself in any trouble.

Last 
month, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
President 
Schlissel 

unveiled a new initiative titled the 
Go Blue Guarantee. Starting in 
January 2018, any current or future 
in-state student whose family earns 
$65,000 or less will be eligible for 
free tuition for four years. For the 
record, let me state, I think this 
is absolutely fantastic. There are 
some students who will benefit 
from this, giving them access to a 
stellar education which may have 
been a distant fantasy because of 
the ever-so-daunting tuition bill. 
However, if you noticed I used the 
word “some” to describe whom the 
Go Blue Guarantee will affect. This 
was entirely deliberate, because 
that’s just it. It will affect some but 
nowhere near close to a majority 
of students who need financial 
support at the University.

As 
an 
out-of-state 
student, 

recognizing none of this will affect 
me anyway, I was easily enamored 
by the words “free tuition” and the 
praise from the administration 
and alumni in the press and across 
social media. However, I realized 
that this initiative is kind of like 
fresh new wallpaper. Once you 
begin to peel back some of its 
allure, you find the same wall that 
you tried to cover up, which … in 
all honesty, isn’t that promising. 
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have tried 
to cover it up in the first place. 

As I started considering these 

thoughts, I became increasingly 
aware of the criticism I may 
receive regarding my opinion. It 
may come across as controversial 
or pessimistic to say the least. 
Hence my selection of the title 
for this piece. However, as I 
began conducting my research, I 
was surprised to find that I was 
not the only person who shared 

this viewpoint. A few days after 
the 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee 
was 

introduced, I noticed a post from 
a Students4Justice activist on 
Facebook.

“Although half of the families 

in Michigan would qualify for this 
new financial aid initiative, how 
many of these students will actually 
have the chance to be accepted 
and to attend the University of 
Michigan?” it read. “This is not an 
initiative to bring more of these 
students to our campus. Let me 
know when UM’s initiatives will 
start to combat the disappearing 
Black 
population 
and 
other 

underrepresented communities of 
color.”

The reactions to her commentary 

were pretty split, as some illustrated 
their support through likes, while 
others debated in the comments. 
It was Jamie’s post that triggered 
my own investigation. My findings 
shine light on a different outlook of 
the Go Blue Guarantee, and more 
importantly answers the question, 
what is this initiative actually 
doing?

At the beginning of this year, 

The New York Times published a 
set of data which reflected statistics 
regarding 
the 
socioeconomic 

status of students attending the 
University. Come to find out, 
the median family income at the 
University is $154,000, and 66 
percent of the student body are 
identified as part of the top 20 
percent income status. This is the 
highest median family income of the 
other 27 public colleges nationwide 
classified as “highly selective” that 
were polled. According to the 2015 
U.S. Census, the median family 
income in the state of Michigan is 
$48,876 so it is indeed correct that 
half of the families in the state 
Michigan would qualify for the Go 
Blue Guarantee, yet, clearly these 
students don’t seem to attend the 
University. Why is that?

In the years since 2008, the 

proportion of low-income recent 
high school graduates who enroll in 
college has seen a significant drop. 
In 2008, 55.9 percent of low-income 
students enrolled in college; by 
2013, that the rate drastically 
decreased to 45.5 percent.

principles, priorities, tastes 
and behavior.

Recently, 
I 
observed 

something that particularly 
struck 
me 
as 
enlightening 

to 
the 
principles 
society 

imparts on everyone, even 
those as young as 8. My 
sister, Talley, showed me a 
book her class made at the 
end of her last school year. 
It was a heartwarming book 
where each page was written 
by a different student who 
explained why they thought 
Talley 
was 
special. 
Each 

student had a similar book 
dedicated to them. I read 
some like, “Talley is special 
because she stands up for 
me,” that left me with a strong 
sense of pride for my sister.

All kept with this sweet 

theme until suddenly I was 
confronted with a page that 
left me conflicted. It read, 

“Talley is special because she 
is beautiful.”

Initially, 
I 
thought 
to 

myself, “How sweet of this 
boy!” However, this feeling 
quickly transitioned to me 
questioning 
the 
sentiment, 

“My sister is special because 
she is beautiful?” Out of all 
the qualities, what makes her 
special is her appearance?

I thought about what this 

imparts to Talley. Will she 
think she should only care 
about her appearance? If her 
peers don’t care about her 
intelligence, 
personality 
or 

interests, will she? Will she 
think that her beauty is what 
makes her special?

I 
thought 
of 
what 
this 

shows us about the young boy 
who wrote the comment. Is it 
already ingrained in his mind 
that the most important aspect 
of a woman is her appearance? 
Does he care about Talley’s 
other qualities?

I asked myself, can I be mad 

at this boy? And I resolved 
that I couldn’t; at the end of 
the day, he issued my sister 
a compliment. But I could 
take this instance to evaluate 

the social conditioning that 
fuels invisible sexism in our 
society.

I took this as a very poignant 

example 
of 
benevolent 

misogyny, or misogyny that 
takes the form of a compliment 
or as subjectively positive. 
While this kid had no intent 
to be prejudiced in any regard, 
or even for that matter no 
ability to understand sexism, 
his words have unexpected 
consequences. I’m sure he 
has learned this from the 
many 
adults 
whose 
first 

words to girls are about their 
outfits or their appearance. 
So, 
it’s 
impossible 
not 
to 

expect the little boy to also 
comment a girl’s beauty, and 
it’s impossible not to expect 
the girl not to care about her 
beauty.

However, 
this 
situation 

leaves 
me 
unresolved. 
To 

expect men to never comment 
on a young girl’s appearance 
seems both unattainable and 
undesirable. Everyone enjoys 
being complimented on their 
looks or clothes from time to 
time. However, young girls 
need to be taught that they 
are much more than what 
they look like. And that starts 
with telling girls that. I don’t 
see anyone telling my brother 
he’s 
special 
because 
he’s 

handsome.

H

eadlining The New York 
Times, 
the 
morning 

of Nov. 9, 2016 read 

the unpredicted results of the 
presidential 
election: 
“Donald 

Trump 
Is 

Elected 
President 
in 
Stunning 

Repudiation 
of the Establishment.” For many 
U.S. citizens and pollsters, these 
results were shocking. How could 
someone who defied political 
correctness, who used abrasive 
language and who seemed so far 
away from a presidential standard 
be elected? Though this may 
seem like a liberal take on the 
results (and admittedly it might 
be), the results were nonetheless 
shocking to both Republicans 
and Democrats alike. The core 
question that scholars and citizens 
are asking is, “what happened?” 
What did Trump possess that was 
so sorely overlooked in the polls?

Following the campaign of 

the 
presidential 
contenders 

throughout the year, the vast 
difference between Clinton and 

Trump 
was 
evident. 
Clinton, 

a longtime politician with an 
impressive 
resume, 
was 
by 

standards 
significantly 
more 

qualified than her opponent. Yet 
her streak of political experiences 
was tainted by scandals. In this 
light, too many Americans saw her 
as a “standard politician” made 
and corrupted by the system. 
She 
represented 
the 
political 

institutions that many American 
citizens 
mistrusted. 
Trump 

offered a far different product to 
voters.

Trump tapped into a market 

demand that Clinton did not. 
Trump 
essentially 
became 
a 

salesman for change. He began 
establishing this market power 
early on in the primaries, defying 
the 
system, 
making 
it 
clear 

that he would dismantle the 
establishment 
in 
Washington. 

While 
D.C. 
politicians 
were 

consumed with their own circle 
of elitists, they forgot to look 
outside the bubble and see that 
the face of rural America had 
changed. Donald Trump’s secret 
was that he was an outsider. His 

monopoly of power that no one 
could compete with was his claim 
to oppose the elitists and to stand 
beside the “working class” citizen. 
A politician who saw political 
correctness as a sham was in 
demand for many Americans.

Trump took advantage of this 

wide-open 
market, 
knowing 

that he could make statements 
that were clearly sexist, racist 
and harsh and still be seen as 
honest. In economic terms, he 
was “raising the price” for voters, 
without losing the quantity of 
voters he needed to secure the 
election. I recall all too familiar 
rhetoric from Trump voters: “Sure 
he is sexist and racist,” they say, 
“but at least he will get things 
done.” In other words, they mean, 
yes, the price to vote for him is 
high, but I still want a politician 
unafraid to defy the system. No 
other candidate could compete 
with this selling point, least of all 
Hillary Clinton.

OPINION

Thursday, July 20, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A hindsight look at the election

federal expropriation. As a means 
of compromise, they decided on 
two things: the federal government 
had almost total legal authority 
over the army and militia and the 
federal 
government 
should 
not 

have any authority at all to disarm 
the citizenry. After realizing this, I 
understood that the debate and gun 
ownership was rooted in U.S. DNA.

I understand that this debate has 

shifted greatly, where most view 
that government isn’t coming for 
one’s guns, people are interested in 
stronger background checks, and 
more is in common between the 
two sides than we like to realize. 
Nevertheless, as much as I can 
quote statistics about gun deaths 
in America, and the gun rights 
advocates can quote gun safety 
statistics, it becomes an argument 
of fact. In the past year as a student 
and neuroscience researcher, I have 
realized statistics can be skewed 
to whichever opinion you feel. It’s 
a form of strong confirmation bias 
where one seeks out information 
only to support their opinion. But as 
much as I can write and speak about 
the truths I find evident through 
research, often it isn’t the statistics 
that will convince either side of the 
argument. We are human beings who 
frequently determine our opinions 

not by what we read but by what we 
experience. This is the fundamental 
issue in most of our debates today: 
we surround ourselves with people 
and ideas of our own. This extreme 
amount of confirmation bias removes 
us from the experience of someone 
drastically different than ourselves, 
so when we approach an issue such 
as gun law, we retreat to our corners 
and tell each other, “Well if you just 
look at the statistics, you’d realize 
your idiocy.” But it’s deeper than 
that. It’s experience.

I grew up in a unique situation, 

where in northern Minnesota, I was 
both living in a city and surrounded 
by a strong hunting and gun rights 
culture. In my self-analysis, I have 
realized that the experiences for those 
in cities versus rural America are 
different. In cities, guns are often the 
weapon of choice for most homicides 
and crimes. They are considered vices 
of the country and are often put into a 
bad light. In rural America, a typical 
fall weekend is going out with one’s 
father or mother to the shooting range 
or the hunting cabin. In my experience, 
I have never fired a gun, but I grew up 
with many people who were both in 
a city environment and often went to 
the firing range or went hunting. They 
went to gun safety classes, were gifted a 
gun for Christmas, and had guns sitting 

around the house. Though I don’t plan 
on going to a gun range anytime soon, 
I do think that it shows a completely 
different 
emotional 
and 
cultural 

difference that most neglect to realize. 
It isn’t a legal debate; it’s a personal 
debate.

As stated before, gun control 

debates are more or less the 
equivalent to an “American element” 
on our metaphorical periodic table. 
It’s a debate rooted in our DNA. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
am 
frustrated 

that many don’t realize that gun 
support isn’t a matter of stupidity 
or idiocy, but rather an inability to 
become fascinated with the thought 
processes of others. These debates 
and questions can be painful, even 
insulting, yet often the intentions 
are not out of spite or malice. We can 
agree to disagree, but we shouldn’t 
forget that almost all debates are 
not black and white. It’s a spectrum. 
Become fascinated with difference 
of opinion.

Analyzing the gun debate
O

n the morning of June 14, 
2017, a few Republican 
lawmakers were at Eugene 

Simpson 
Stadium 
Park 

in 
Alexandria, 

Va. when shots 
ran out. It was 
the last practice 
before the congressional baseball 
game, which occurred every year to 
raise money for charity since 1909. 
When a loud gunshot went off, the 
men and women hit the ground, 
crouched in the dugout, behind 
fences and in the long outfield 
grass. Steve Scalise, the House of 
Representatives 
Majority 
Whip 

from Louisiana, stood at second 
base. He had nowhere to hide. He 
looked to the dugout before being 
struck in the left hip and collapsed 
to the ground. After struggling to 
army crawl to safety, he made it to 
center field, lying in the grass until 
the shooting stopped. Though police 
killed the shooter, the bullet broke 
Mr. Scalise’s bones, caused major 
internal bleeding and tore his organs.

I read how the shooter had 

multiple rounds of ammunition, a 
semi-automatic weapon and mental 
health issues. I thought, “How did this 
man get ahold of a weapon with such 
firepower? How many more shootings 
like this before we have to have stricter 
gun control?”

After this atrocity, many saw it as 

another example of a terrible shooting 
in our recent history. People wanted 
change with our nation’s approach to 
guns. My initial conclusion, as it has 
always been, was to have much more 
stringent gun control laws. I soon read 
that same day that many, especially 
Republicans, were calling for more 
guns to prevent instances like these. 
After hearing this, I had to take a 
second thought. We had read or seen 
exactly the same event, with exactly 
the same outcome, and we came to 
exactly the opposite conclusion. To 
most, I think that this would have been 
disheartening and another reason for 
gun control advocates to blow off gun 
rights supporters, calling them crazy 
and disillusioned. However, I became 
extremely fascinated and interested in 
the gun control debate, not to become 
angrily aggressive towards gun rights 
supporters, but because I quickly 
realized that even with the same event, 
two very different conclusions can be 
reached. This is a debate that is much 
more complicated than both sides tend 
to let on.

I am writing this not to voice 

support for the gun control lobby, 
but as a reflective piece. Rather than 
engaging in partisanship, I became 
greatly inquisitive about the logic of 
your average gun rights supporter 
(not just the NRA). To improve my 
understanding, I decided to turn to 
the Second Amendment. Now, I have 
read court opinions from Supreme 
Court cases addressing the Second 
Amendment (District of Columbia 
v. Heller and McDonald v. City of 
Chicago), but I wanted to keep an open 
mind. There I read:

“A well-regulated Militia, being 

necessary to the security of a free State, 
the right of the people to keep and bear 
Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Simply considering the wording of 

the Second Amendment, I was stopped 
within the first four words: a well-
regulated Militia. In my instinctual 
emotions of gun rights, I would have 
said that the debate should be over 
right there. Regulation is extremely 
necessary for guns, and since militias 
are mostly an entity of the past, it 
doesn’t make much sense for people 
to still own guns. Nevertheless, 
maintaining 
strong 
introspection 

was and is currently my goal. My gut 
reaction was in my interpretation 
of regulation. I hear the word, and I 
conclude naturally a need for an assault 
weapons ban among other measures, 
but for many, this “regulation” means 
better background checks, but more 
guns on more people. I quickly realized 
that is an error in communication for 
both sides of the debate.

Secondly, I arrived at the word 

“necessary.” This is where I believe 
the heart of the debate rests. What is 
necessary today? To understand this, 
I thought that I should learn more of 
the history of gun rights in America. In 
the founding generation, many found 
that governments were oppressive to 
its people. To respond to unexpected 
attacks, governments would depend on 
a militia of ordinary civilians, supplying 
his or her own weapons. After the 
Revolutionary War, the Constitutional 
Convention realized militia forces 
could not be relied on for national 
defense; therefore, the government 
should have the authority to regulate 
its militias. This became a classic Anti-
Federalist versus Federalist debate, 
establishing the root of the modern 
debate today.

This was one of many firsts 

where there was a massive shift in 
power from the states to the federal 
government. Anti-Federalists said 
that this removal of defense would 
all but diminish any effort against

20th CENTURY FOX 

Maurice gazes with fear

At first glance, “War for the 

Planet of the Apes” doesn’t resemble 
a modern war movie. Where most 
films of the genre trade in bloody 
action and bountiful shots of brawny 
men shouting at each other, the final 
chapter in the “Apes” reboot trilogy 
is quiet. Contemplative even. Entire 
sequences pass without a single word 
of dialogue. Large scale battle scenes 
are few and far between, replaced by 
moving character drama, nuanced 
acting and Biblical allegory. It’s full 
of brutally intense scenes, of course, 
but it’s far more interested in the 
effects of war than the fighting of the 
war itself. At its core, “War for the 
Planet of the Apes” is a story about 
hate, and for a trilogy that has always 
used characters discovering their 
humanity to tell stories of mankind’s 
flaws, it’s a nearly perfect ending.

“War” picks up some time after 

“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” 
ended with the beginning of a 
conflict between the sentient apes 
led by Caesar (Andy Serkis, “Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens”) and 
the United States military. Caesar is 
struggling to manage the balancing 
act between protecting his people 
and maintaining hope for peace, 
but after an unspeakable tragedy, he 
embarks on a mission to assassinate 
the military leader responsible, 
a man known as the Colonel 
(Woody Harrelson, “The Edge of 
Seventeen”).

It almost goes without saying 

that Serkis is perfect as Caesar. The 
man is practically synonymous 
with Oscar-caliber motion-capture 

work, and his performance in “War 
for the Planet of the Apes” is no 
exception. In his first shot alone, 
Serkis wordlessly communicates 
Caesar’s weariness with the war for 
the humans but resolve to fight for 
his people. Every moment he is on 
screen, he seems to be shouldering 
a load that only grows heavier as the 
story wears on. There isn’t a single 
scene that he doesn’t absolutely 

own, though Steve Zahn (“Captain 
Fantastic”) bears mentioning as the 
delightful newcomer, Bad Ape.

The same praise goes for the 

effects that work with Serkis to bring 
Caesar to life. They’re far beyond 
anything we’ve seen on the big 
screen. The faith that director Matt 
Reeves (“Let Me In”) puts in these 
effects and his performers is obvious. 
Dialogue scenes — usually involving 
a fair bit of American Sign Language 
— are shot almost exclusively in 
close-ups to take in the subtlety 
of the acting and the breathtaking 
quality of the CGI. It’s perfect 
synergy between actor, director and 
effects artists, almost unparalleled 
in modern blockbusters.

All of this is put to work in a deeply 

human story about hate that casts 
humanity in the role of the villains. 

The new “Apes” films have always 
been about prejudice, and “War” 
finds those feelings finally reaching 
and threatening to consume Caesar. 
The journey that he goes on that 
finds him fighting those feelings 
is spellbinding and lends further 
credence to the argument that the 
character ranks as one of the best 
film protagonists of the decade. For 
all his film’s epic ambitions, Reeves 
never loses sight of the personal 
nature of the story as it relates to his 
lead.

But for all its exemplary acting, 

effects and direction, the most 
shocking thing about “War” is still 
how little it resembles a modern 
war movie. In fact, the whole 
thing functions as an extended 
metaphor for the biblical book of 
Exodus, leading to a movie that 
resembles Cecil B. Demille’s “The 
Ten Commandments” more than 
any war movie released in the last 
decade. From Caesar’s struggle 
to lead his people out of captivity 
to the hard-hearted tyrant at the 
heart of the conflict, the imagery 
is obvious but never forced.

“War” is a rare class of film no 

matter how it’s viewed. As a war 
movie, it bucks convention with 
its slow pacing and intimate plot. 
As a modern blockbuster, it does 
the same with its focus on flooring 
performances 
and 
intelligent 

script. As the third chapter in 
a trilogy, it isn’t just good; it’s a 
masterclass in character-based 
storytelling. As the credits roll 
not just on the movie, but on 
the trilogy, there should be no 
doubt that the rebooted “Apes” 
franchise ranks as one of the best 
of all time.

‘Apes’ trilogy ends perfectly

Tyler, the Creator 
at Agenda Festival

Long Beach, CA — Agenda 

Show arrived in annual fashion 
this 
past 
weekend, 
uniting 

industry-insiders from streetwear 
and performance gear for two 
days of flaunting at the Long 
Beach Convention Center, but 
this year the SoCal trade-show 
came with added muscle and 
extra events, opening its doors 
publicly on Sat., Jul. 15th for a 
concert headlined by Tyler, the 
Creator. At the inaugural Agenda 
Festival, attendees could shop 
at or interact with hundreds of 
booths by skateboarding, surfing 
and lifestyle brands before hitting 
the show, which also included 
sets from Ludacris, Cam’ron and 
Lil Dicky.

The pop-up mall’s roster of 

exhibits spanned from buzzy 
fashion labels like Rip N’ Dip, 
Staple and The Hundreds all the 
way to record shops, Rainbow 
flip-flops and indoor skateparks. 
Some booths offered souped up 
shopping 
opportunities 
while 

others set up simple, inoperable 
photo-ops. At Champions, custom 
embroidery was available on 
purchased items and at Herschel, 
a limited number of festival tote 
bags were given out. Yet, the 
flashiest finds were at nationally-
acclaimed vintage collectors like 
Versus ATL — that’s where I saw a 
Louis Vuitton x Supreme sweater 
marked at $2,000 and some 
vintage rap t-shirts with not-so-
distant price points.

It’s foolish to shop lavishly at 

an Odd Future fans’ get-together 
though, especially if you plan 
on standing anywhere close to 
the stage. At Agenda, Tyler, the 
Creator’s fans flocked to the pit 
immediately after Lil Dicky’s 
set ceased, Golf Wang garb 
acting as a nearly unanimous 
uniform 
and 
foreshadowing 

their 
impartialness 
towards 

other 
upcoming 
acts. 
While 

festival 
organizers 
seemed 

intent 
on 
curating 
a 
truly 

multifaceted 
experience, 
it 

became progressively apparent 
throughout the afternoon that 

Tyler was the main attraction.

Cam’ron came out next, but 

even with his figurehead-status 
in hip-hop fashion offering an 
apparent bridge to the youth, 
he failed to ignite the crowd 
of teens and 20-somethings to 
its full potential, a key sign of 
the afternoon’s disjointedness. 
Opening track “Killa Cam” and 
other dated hits like “Down & 
Out,” “Oh Boy” and “I Really Need 
It” earned somewhat emphatic 
reactions, as did the Diplomats 
songs “Bout It III” and “Dipset 
Anthem.” Yet, beyond their hooks, 
few audience members seemed 
familiar with the songs’ lyrics, as 
was the case on deeper cuts “Wet 
Wipes” and “Get It In Ohio.”

Dressed in baggy designer jeans 

and a careful combination of black 
and yellow, from his sneakers 
to his Simpsons t-shirt and 
backwards hat, Cam’ron looked 
like an artifact left over from a 
former era of hip hop, especially 
while performing the sexually 
aggressive “Suck It Or Not,” 
which fails to translate overall in 
2017. He couldn’t truly connect 
with the audience until he landed 
on “Hey Ma,” the crowd-favorite 
singalong from his otherwise 
macabre discography, and by that 
time, his set had ended. Next up 
was Ludacris.

“Where the real Ludacris fans 

at?” 
the 
rapper-turned-actor 

asked the crowd after opening 
with “Welcome To Atlanta” and 
his verse from the gimmicky DJ 
Khaled hit “All I Do Is Win.” 
“They probably just ‘Fast & 
Furious’ fans,” he told his DJ. “I 
think we gotta test them out!” 
Throughout the next 40 minutes, 
Ludacris tore through a series of 
hits that spanned across three 
decades and two genres — pop & 
hip-hop. “Act A Fool,” “Southern 
Hospitality,” “Area Codes” and 
“Roll Out” appeased his oldest 
fans, while hits like Usher’s 
“Yeah” and his own “Pimpin’ 
All Over The World,” “Money 
Maker,” “How Low” and “My 
Chick Bad” excited the entire 
audience.

Ludacris engaged with the crowd

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com ARTS

As 
children, 
the 
“entire 

world” can be a lot of things. For 
some, it’s the universe — every 
solar system in the galaxy. For 
others, it’s the planet Earth. For 
a few, it’s the small town, city or 
village in which they grew up. 
And for one, it’s a hermetically 
sealed bunker in the middle of 
a Californian desert. That one 
person is James Pope (Kyle 
Mooney, “Saturday Night Live”), 
and the film “Brigsby Bear” 
is a touching story about his 
discovery of the world outside 
the bunker.

“Brigsby Bear,” which initially 

premiered 
at 
the 
Sundance 

Film Festival last February, was 
presented as the closing film of 
the Semaine de Critics (Critic’s 
Week) at the 2017 Cannes Film 
Festival. On a balmy afternoon 
in the famed French Rivera, the 
Daily had the opportunity to sit 
down with the film’s creators: 
longtime friends Kyle Mooney, 
Dave McCary (writer: “Saturday 
Night Live”) and Kevin Costello 
(writer: “Brigsby Bear”), along 
with Greg Kinnear (“Little Miss 
Sunshine,” “Stuck in Love”), who 
plays Detective Vogel in the film. 
Speaking with Mooney, McCary 
and Costello, it is clear that the 
strong themes of friendship and 
dreaming present on-screen are 
even more prevalent off-screen. 
The heart of “Brigsby Bear,” 
from its inception to the finished 
product, lies in the unique magic 
that is, as McCary puts it, “the 
passion for creativity that is 
discovered... and friends coming 
together.”

Before being rescued from his 

(unknowing) 
captivity, 
there 

are a few things about which 
James is certain: he loves his 
parents (captors), Ted (Mark 
Hamill, “Star Wars”) and Clare 
(Claire Danes, “Homeland”) and 
“Brigsby Bear,” the children’s 
television 
show 
he 
watches 

each day, is the best show in the 
world. He is not only the show’s 
ultimate fan — he runs an online 
“Brigsby” 
forum, 
fantasizes 

about the female heroine Arielle 
Smiles (Katie Lyn Shell, “House 

of Cards”), discusses fan theories 
rabidly — but also, he is the 
show’s only fan. Out of captivity 
and in the real world, it comes 
to light that “Brigsby Bear” had 
been made exclusively for James. 
Every single week since he was 
kidnapped, captor Ted created 
an episode of the nostalgic, 
weird, laser-infused pedagogical 
nonsense that is the TV show 
and presented it.

There’s the crux of the film. 

In Mooney’s words, “Brigsby 
Bear” is a movie “about a kid 
who watches this TV show that 
nobody has ever seen.”

James’s discovery that he is 

the show’s only watcher sets 
him on a journey to “find out 
how his favorite show is going 
to end,” according to Costello. 
This journey — motivated by 
a simple, pure desire — serves 
as the catalyst that acclimates 
James into a world he never 
knew existed, fosters his passion 
for filmmaking and harnesses 
the power of friendship. On 
why he chose this journey for 
James, Mooney explained that, 
“what this story allows us — 
not only do we get to see the 
progression of James and his life 
(but also) starting in one world 
and breaking into an entirely 
new 
universe 
that’s 
totally 

mysterious.” 

He added a second, more 

personal reason on why this 
story: “We (Mooney, Costello, 
McCary) do love all of these 
children’s TV shows and videos.” 
It’s true. The trio’s love for this 
type of TV and video dates back 
to their younger days, when 
Mooney exposed Costello and 
McCary to his “extensive VHS 
collection.” 
The 
collection, 

says McCary, has some “really 
obscure thrift store finds that 
(they’ve) in turn become big fans 
of.”

Stylistic and thematic aspects 

of these “obscure thrift store” 
videos are central to both the 
script and finished film. Each 
collaborator — Costello, Mooney 
and 
McCary 
— 
connected 

differently with these videos. 
For McCary, it was “a nostalgia 
there because there were just 
puppeted, infinite kid’s videos 

back then. But also, they’re just 
disturbing… telling a kid how 
they should live their life in that 
vulnerable of an age, and telling 
a kid what they should believe.” 
Watching 
James 
struggle 

between what he was raised to 
believe and what he has come to 
know is an interesting paradox — 
and in a way, a completely normal 
part of growing up. Not everyone 
is 
raised 
in 
a 
bunker, 
but 

everyone ultimately experiences 
disillusionment with the world 
they thought they knew.

It’s 
for 
this 
reason 
that 

the film “Brigsby Bear” is so 
honest and relatable, despite 
its 
rather 
unconventional 

circumstances. 
The 
bunker 

feels like a unique framing 
device for a genuine coming-
of-age story. It would have been 
easy to make the film about a 
“fish-out-of-water” and spend 
the whole time putting James 
into 
wacky 
situations. 
It’s 

probably what was expected, 
given the history of the long-
time collaborators. McCary 
and Mooney are founders of 
the L.A. sketch comedy group 
“Good Neighbor” and now 
work together on “Saturday 
Night Live.”

A “SNL” brand film garners 

different expectations than 
what this film is. Even Greg 
Kinnear admits that, when 
his agent first approached 
him about the script, he was 
hesitant. “Just knowing from 
SNL, I thought it would be 
more gaggy and broad.” After 
reading the script, however, 
what 
impressed 
him 
was 

how “inspired and incredibly 
unexpected” the story was. 
The sincerity shone through.

The trio knew, from day one, 

that this was the approach they 
wanted. “It was important for 
us to never reach for jokes or 
get too silly, even though we 

have a background in comedy and 
we work at SNL... I think the most 
interesting version of this story to us 
was the most grounded,” McCary 
notes. 

The decision to find comedy in a 

grounded situation was wise. It is a 
sign of a well-trained improviser and 
comedian: They look to find “truth in 
comedy” instead of simply the easiest 
joke. It’s because the creators stayed 
true to their roots — be it longtime 
friendship, comedy, or obsessions 
with VHS videos — that “Brigsby 
Bear” is much more than an off-beat 
indie festival film.

At the end of the interview, 

McCary and Mooney reflect on the 

process.

“It was very meta and surreal 

when we were in the premiere of our 
film. We’re sitting there watching the 
film about friends who discovered 
filmmaking together put on the 
premiere of their film while we’re 
watching, as best friends, and they’re 
best friends…” began McCary.

Mooney interjects, “…and they’re 

hoping their film is received well 
while we’re sitting there hoping 
our film within a film within a film 
within a film is received well.”

All of this, thanks to a giant robotic 

bear named “Brigsby.”

FILM INTERVIEW

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS 

SNL star Kyle Mooney stars in “Brigsby Bear”


and by the end of his set, it was 

wholly apparent how he’s managed 
to remain so relevant — hit after hit, 
smile after smile, he is impossible not 
to appreciate. After “Move, Bitch” 

and “Get Back,” two of his rowdiest 
tracks, Ludacris left the stage 
for Tyler to claim. Finally, the 
crowd was ignited.

With his new album Flower 

Boy (formerly Scum Fuck Flower 
Boy) due out later this week (it 
already leaked and had been 
heard by many), Tyler’s set 
seemed bound to bring an extra 

kick. Of course, that would only 
come after his DJ, Taco, played 
Drake and Playboi Carti songs 
off his MacBook for 30 minutes, 
but finally, Tyler arrived right 
around 7:00 PM. By this time, his 
fans had already been warned by 
security more than once to relax, 
yet they thrust forth regardless, 
likely incited by his re-doing of 

the set’s introduction because he 
wanted to see more excitement.

Dressed in a peach-colored 

jumpsuit to match his new 
signature Converse, Tyler went 
through a series of songs from his 
last two albums before arriving 
at “Who Dat Boy,” one of two 
lead singles off his upcoming 
project. The song is teasing 

but 
eruptive, 
and 
halfway 

through 
it, 
he 
whispered 

into the microphone, “I’m 
gonna take a break,” only to 
introduce his pal A$AP Rocky 
onstage to cover for him. 
The crowd roared as Rocky 
recited his verse, continuing 
on stage as Tyler and him went 
through the A$AP Mob track 
“Telephone Calls,” but when 
Rocky said the pair “might 
need to drop an album or 
something soon,” grinningly 
dropping the explosive line 
on his way off stage, fans 
absolutely lost it.

Tyler followed this high-

point with some mellower 
melodies, 
playing 
“911,” 
a 

softer 
single 
off 
his 
new 

album, 
before 
rapping 
his 

verse 
from 
Frank 
Ocean’s 

recent single “Biking.” Odd 
Future fans’ favorite mosh 
pit anthem, “Tamale,” came 
next, but it was oddly followed 
by “Mr. Lonely” and “She” — 
two more softies. Before his 
breakout hit “Yonkers,” Tyler 
reminded fans that the song 
is now a steep six years old, 
an apparent sign of their cult’s 
mortality, then finished his set 
with “I Ain’t Got Time,” a song 
off his new album, claiming to 
hope we liked it but also to not 
really care if we didn’t, still 
pretending that we hadn’t all 
already heard the entire album 
and loved it, like, absolutely 
loved it.

printmaking, she now primar-

ily works with clay. Her work 
at this year’s Fair consists of a 
variety of sculptures, many of 
which are meant to decorate a 
garden. Farris notes the com-
petitive selection process for the 
artists. “There has to be some-
thing about your work that is 
unusual because you’re compet-
ing against so many other art-
ists. There has to be a reason why 
they picked this ceramic artist 
over the (many) others that have 
applied,” she explained.

Considering the fierce compe-

tition, the Art Fair features work 
created by some of the most tal-
ented artists across the country. 
Over 1,000 artists attend with 
their booths lining the city’s 
streets.

The abundance of entertain-

ment encourages many to return 
to the Fair every year; LSA junior 
Anna DeVeaux has attended the 
festival with her family for 15 
consecutive years and wishes to 
continue her streak.

“It’s really fun to just walk 

around because of all the differ-
ent things going on — all of the 
community 
comes 
together,” 

DeVeaux said. “It’s just a real-
ly cool vibe to be around. And 
there’s great street food.”

DeVeaux 
points 
out 
the 

dynamic atmosphere during the 
Art Fair. “All of the streets are 
completely packed and there’s so 
much energy because everyone 
is going in between booths... it’s 
really bustling and everyone’s 
super interested in everything 
they’re going past.”

Although the Fair can be a 

hindrance to local residents — 
streets close and traffic becomes 
nightmarish — the city puts 
on the Townie Street Party to 
thank locals for their patience 
and cooperation during the busy 
weekend. Still, the Fair’s lack 
of parking has become a joke in 
and of itself. “We have this post-
er in our family room that just 
has pictures of all the no park-
ing signs from the Ann Arbor 
Art Fair. It’s a funny joke to us,” 
DeVeaux said.

Nevertheless, 
she 
believes 

scarce parking and large crowds 
shouldn’t 
stop 
anyone 
from 

attending, 
explaining 
that 

“there’s really something for 
everyone,” making it one of the 
most exciting events in Metro 
Detroit all year.

The message of O.J.

By JASON ROWLAND

Michigan in Color Managing Editor

I’m going to ask you three questions, and I need you to answer honestly.
First, did you know that Black children are punished more often and more severe-

ly than their white classmates? Second, that Black borrowers are much less likely 
to be granted a loan than their white counterparts with similar credit scores? And 
third, that employers prefer applicants with “white”-sounding names over those with 
“Black”-sounding ones?

If you’re like most Americans, you probably did know all of that. Those facts don’t 

surprise you in the slightest; they’re just a reality of life. And that is the problem.

When those facts are given as simple statistics, they’re easy to ignore because of 

how commonly accepted they are — even for people who claim to care deeply about 
these issues. Yet when they’re packaged into other mediums, such as television, film 
or music, they’re denounced for mixing politics and entertainment. This creates a 
dilemma where these issues aren’t properly acknowledged because the “accepted” 
ways to discuss them are ineffective, but using other mediums (mainly, the arts) is 
deemed taboo.

The good news is that breaking such “taboos” can create a dialogue that fights 

to tackle many of these issues. For example, I wouldn’t be writing this article if the 
response to Jay-Z’s “The Story of O.J.” — a song on the rapper’s album 4:44 that details 
the Black community’s struggles against poverty and racism — hadn’t been so nega-
tive. The bad news: in order for any good to come from these conversations, we must 
move past the hypocritical idea that one can claim to be a fan of Black artists yet turn 
them off when they start talking about Black issues. Especially when these “Black 
issues” are systemic problems of racism, segregation and discrimination — problems 
that require the attention of more than just the African American community.

While “The Story of O.J.” has received a generally positive reception from music 

ritics, many casual listeners hold a much less favorable opinion of the song — with 
most finding offense in the song’s coarse language and frequent allusions to Black 
stereotypes. However, the detractors are offended for all of the wrong reasons. People 
need to be outraged that these problems exist, not by the way they’re being discussed 
by the victims. And, perhaps more importantly, people need to realize that the only 
reason these problems are being discussed so frankly in popular culture is because 
they’d otherwise continue to be swept under the rug and ignored.

“Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga / Still nigga,” a line from the “The 

Story of O.J,” sends the same message as “African Americans, regardless of their 
income levels or occupations, are discriminated against.” The difference is that one 
grabs your attention, while the other fades into the background as just another com-
monly accepted, if unfortunate, reality. To spark a discussion, we’ve given artists no 
choice but to use ostensibly provocative language. And by blaring Jay-Z when he raps 
about money and fame but muting him when he talks about real issues, you’re simply 
allowing these problems to continue unsolved by depriving them of the attention they 
deserve.

If we’re ever going to address these massive issues about race and discrimination, 

we need to first have a conversation. And in order to have a conversation, we must 
be cognizant of the issues at hand. Since traditional facts and figures haven’t drawn 
enough attention, the only way to raise this awareness is through unsparing channels 
such as “The Story of O.J.”

One of the great things about music is that it exposes listeners to cultures other than 

their own — and this cross-cultural exposure can change the world. However, this can 
only happen once people step out from the schoolhouse door and let the change in. For 
this to occur, we must be willing to listen and empathize with the experiences of art-
ists without complaining, because if you get offended listening to them, just imagine 
how offended the artists get living those experiences every day.

Health care town hall in Plymouth gives voice to Michiganders’ 
fears over ramifications of possible repeal of Obamacare

Nearly 200 people attended 

a town hall on health care 
Sunday morning in Plymouth, 
hoping 
to 
receive 
answers 

on 
how 
their 
care 
would 

change under the Better Care 
Reconciliation Act, the GOP plan 
to repeal and replace the Obama 
administration’s Affordable Care 
Act currently making its way 
through the Senate.

The town hall was hosted 

by 
the 
11th 
Congressional 

District’s chapter of Indivisible, 
a 
progressive 
activist 
group 

formed 
in 
response 
to 
the 

Trump administration. Fielding 
questions were Rep. Dan Kildee 
(D–Mich.), state Rep. Christine 
Greig 
(D–Farmington 
Hills) 

and Charles Gaba, an expert on 
health care who runs the website 
ACAsignups.net, which provides 
data on national health care.

The 
version 
of 
the 
GOP 

bill that passed the House of 
Representatives 
in 
May 
was 

projected by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office to 
kick 14 million people off health 
insurance by next year and 23 
million by 2026, which Kildee 
called a tragedy at the beginning 
of the town hall.

“It’s a tragedy of human 

dimensions 
that 
is 
almost 

impossible to contemplate,” he 
said.

Throughout 
the 
town 

hall, Kildee stressed that the 
impact of the BCRA would not 
be limited to just the tens of 
millions who would become 
uninsured because of it. Like it 
or not, Kildee said “we all pay for 
one another’s health care.”

“The 
loss 
of 
access 
to 

preventive care simply means 
that 
as 
those 
individuals 

ultimately access the health 
care system, they will do it at 
a point in time when they are 
far more sick, when the cost 
will be a higher cost for a more 
serious disease and very likely 

will result in care that is not 
compensated,” he said. “So what 
happens? All the costs that are 
not compensated are shifted. 
Shifted to people who have 
health insurance, or ultimately 
shifted to the biggest insurer, 
the United States government, 
through Medicare.”

Under the BCRA, Medicare — 

the 
single-payer 

health 
insurance 

system 
managed 

by 
the 
federal 

government, 
benefitting 
U.S. 

citizens over the 
age of 65 — will 
become insolvent, 
Kildee said.

In addition to 

the 
problems 
it 

would cause for 
those on Medicare, 
the 
bill, 
which 

puts a prohibition 
on 
funding 

for 
Planned 

Parenthood, 
would 
also 

severely 
reduce 

care for women, 
Greig and Kildee 
pointed out.

“Whether 
we 
like 
it 
or 

not — and I don’t — the Hyde 
Amendment is still in effect that 
prevents federal dollars from 
being used for abortion services,” 
Kildee 
said. 
“But 
because 

Planned Parenthood provides a 
legal right to women to access 
those services and also provides 
other services, the 12 men in 
the senate who are making the 
decision about what this bill says 
have decided that women should 
not have that right. And that’s 
pathetic.”

And 
though 
the 
Hyde 

Amendment 
bans 
federal 

funding of abortion services, 
as Kildee pointed out, abortion 
should be treated and funded as 
health care, Greig said.

“Abortion is health care,” she 

said. “We can’t shy away from 
it. We are at the lowest levels 
of 
unintended 
pregnancies 

right now, the lowest levels of 
STDs, teen pregnancies. And 
a lot of that has to do with the 
services provided by Planned 
Parenthood.”

Kildee 
characterized 

the 
defunding 
of 
Planned 

Parenthood 
as 
governmental 

overreach 
by 
Republicans, 

calling them hypocrites.

“We have to make sure that 

we’re clear on what this is,” he 
said. “Remember that whole ‘if 
you like your doctor, you can 
keep your doctor,’ and what 
they said about Obama when 
there were problems with that? 
They’re actually saying that you 
can only go to the health care 
provider that they approve of.”

Gaba, whose website tracks 

data on the Affordable Care Act, 
explained some of the important 
changes that would take effect 
upon passage of the BCRA.

“Under the ACA, insurance 

companies 
for 
all 
plans 

guaranteed issue. ‘Guaranteed 
issue’ means they have to sell 
a policy to you,” he said. “And 
that’s really important, because 
before the ACA, if you had a 
pre-existing 
condition, 
like, 

say, being pregnant, or having 
cancer, pretty much whatever 
the insurance company defined 

as a pre-existing condition, they 
could say ‘nah, we’re not going to 
sign you up.’ “

But according to Gaba, one of 

the most important aspects of the 
BCRA was not what it would do 
to Obamacare, but what it would 
do to Medicaid, the government-
sponsored insurance program 
for 
low-resource 
individuals 

and 
families. 

According to the 
CBO reporton the 
BCRA, Medicaid 
spending 
would 

decrease by $772 
billion over the 
next ten years.

“The Medicaid 

impact is actually 
the larger story 
here,” 
Gaba 

said. 
“Around 

75 
million 

Americans 
are 

on 
Medicaid. 

The Senate bill 
not only repeals 
the expansion of 
Medicaid, but it 
also 
decimates 

standard 
Medicaid 
that 

has nothing to do with the ACA. 
This was supposed to be about 
repealing Obamacare, it was not 
supposed to decimate Medicaid 
as well.”

In response to an audience 

member’s 
question 
about 

Democratic 
Party 
messaging, 

which the audience member said 
wasn’t bold enough and focused 
only on opposing Republicans, 
Kildee and Greig both said their 
long-term vision for health care 
was to have universal coverage.

“I think we all have to 

acknowledge that in the last 
decade or so — even less than 
that — as a society, as a nation, 
we’ve made some progress on 
this 
question,” 
Kildee 
said. 

“Clearly, the passage of the ACA 
is a massive step forward. That’s 
not what I’m talking about. 
Just listen to the debate now as 
compared to the debate that took 
place under a decade ago. There’s 

an 
acknowledgement 
across 

much of the political spectrum 
that we have to get to universal 
coverage and that the federal 
government has to guarantee 
this right.”

And coverage should not be 

dependent on your employment 
status, Greig said.

“Back in the day, I used to put 

in payroll HR benefit systems for 
corporations, and I used to have 
to plug in the new charges every 
year for the plans so they could 
take the payroll deductions and 
all that, and I remember back 
then, just thinking ‘that is just 
nuts that we tie employment 
and health benefits together,’ “ 
she said. “We’ve gotta rethink 
this, and make sure that we 
have universal coverage and 
it’s not forced to be tied with 
employment.”

Bob McCreevey, an audience 

member from Oakland County, 
said he had given his testimony 
on the pain he had been caused by 
privatization of health services 
at five different town halls, as 
well as before a committee in 
the state legislature. His son, 
who 
suffers 
from 
paranoid 

schizophrenia, had been in a 
support program for 12 years that 
kept him in a stable condition 
“beyond all belief,” McCreevey 
said. After the government voted 
to privatize the program, he said 
the annual cost of caring for his 
son increased from about $1,800 
to $180,000. Testifying before 
the House committee, he said, he 
lost his faith in government.

“It’s different when you hear 

it on the news,” he said. “When 
you sit in that room over there, 
on the third floor of the Capitol, 
and you watch 20 Republicans, 
and it’s like pulling the strings 
on a Howdy-Doody: ‘yes, yes, 
yes, yes, yes.’ It’s disgusting. 
This is no longer America that I 
know. When we don’t take care 
of ‘of, by, and for the people,’ and 
the only thing we care about is 
the half of one percent that are 
running this country in a broken 
government.”

Dakich to transfer to Ohio State

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team has seen a graduate transfer 
to a rival Big Ten school in each 
of the last two seasons. Forward 
Max Bielfeldt transferred to 
Indiana in 2015, and guard 
Spike Albrecht played his final 
season of college 
basketball 
at 

Purdue 
last 

season. 

That 
streak 

will 
continue 

this season with 
perhaps the most 
unlikely transfer 
yet.

Monday, ESPN’s 

Jeff 
Goodman 

reported 
that 

former Wolverine guard Andrew 
Dakich will join Ohio State as a 
graduate transfer this season. 
The Buckeyes’ new head coach, 
Chris Holtmann, was looking to 
add backcourt help, and before 
taking the job at Ohio State had 
been recruiting Dakich to play 
for him at Butler.

A former walk-on, Dakich 

appeared 
in 
49 
games 
at 

Michigan and scored 22 points. 
He had planned to redshirt in 
both the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 
seasons, but burned his redshirt 
both years due to an onslaught of

in my shoes, I think a lot of people 
would have done the same thing.”

While Dakich’s defection to 

the Wolverines’ fiercest rival 
is sure to rub some fans in the 
wrong way, that’s not the case 
with his former coach, John 
Beilein.

“He was great, he understood 

my situation completely and I’ll 
actually be up there this week 
to work a camp for him,” Dakich 
told MLive. “There’s no bad 
blood at all. He’s happy for me 
to have this opportunity to play 
at Ohio State for a great coach he 
respects. And coach Holtmann 
had the same conversation with 
him.

“This all happened about a 

week ago and coach Beilein was 
great. I have the utmost respect 
for him and he knows that.”

Notebook: Wolverines enjoy 
afternoon with AS Roma

As much as he would’ve 

liked to play soccer Monday 
afternoon, Jim Harbaugh simply 
couldn’t.

Bothered by a hip flexor 

injury suffered earlier this 
month while playing softball 
against 
staff 
and 
camp 

members at Camp Michigania, 
Harbaugh stood by the side 
and watched as members of 
the Michigan football team 
participated 
in 
soccer 
and 

football related activities with 
players from AS Roma, an 
Italian soccer club.

During their trip to Rome 

in 
April, 
the 
Wolverines 

practiced at Roma’s facilities. 
Monday, 
the 

team’s manager, 
CEO and several 
players 
made 

their way to Ann 
Arbor to spend 
more time with 
Harbaugh 
and 

Michigan. Roma 
is slated to play 
against 
Paris 

Saint-Germain 
at Comerica Park 
Wednesday night — a matchup 
that Harbaugh said he is slated 
to attend.

It was readily apparent that he 

has developed an appreciation 
for 
Roma 
— 
especially 

when it comes to members 
of the staff, who he spent 
much of Monday’s activities 
in 
spirited 
conversation 

with, 
and 
midfielder 
Kevin 

Strootman. Harbaugh bonded 
with Strootman over both his 
competitiveness and his return 
to top form after two ACL 
injuries.

“You see how competitive 

(Strootman) is and I’m sure 
that bodes well for him in 
what he does playing football,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s great to 
see the guys interact and have a 
little bit of fun.”

Monday’s activities, in which 

Michigan and Roma players 
competed in several challenges, 
such as fielding punts, kicking 
field 
goals 
and 
scoring 
on 

penalty kicks, were some of 
the few remaining moments of 

levity before the season starts. 
The Wolverines are set to break 
for fall camp July 31, and have 
been preparing with team and 
player-led workouts for much of 
the past couple months.

It has been an eventful 

offseason, to say the least. 
Many of Michigan’s players 
left the country for the first 
time with the trip overseas 
before the entire team had 
all of May off to study abroad 
or pursue internships. Now, 
the Wolverines are ready, as 
Harbaugh 
has 
said 
before, 

to enter the submarine once 
again.

“All deep breaths have been 

taken,” Harbaugh said. “Now 
it’s time to train and get ready 
for the season.”

Johnson done 

with football at 
Michigan

In 
April, 

Harbaugh 
left 
open 
the 

possibility 
for 

running 
back 

Drake Johnson to 
return for a sixth 
year on the team. 
Now, it appears 
Johnson’s 

decision is final, and he won’t be 
returning to the gridiron for the 
Wolverines.

“Drake Johnson is going 

to continue at Michigan, he’s 
going to take classes this 
fall,” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“The latest is he’s not going 
to participate in football, he’s 
going to concentrate on track. 
He’ll be here for another year.”

Johnson’s career at Michigan 

has been star-crossed, to say the 
least. He has suffered multiple 
ACL injuries that have taken 
him many months to recover 
from. Johnson was ready to 
return to the field last spring 
before yet another setback: He 
was run over by a forklift and 
suffered undisclosed injuries 
that kept him on the sidelines 
for months.

In his career at Michigan, 

Johnson appeared in 25 games, 
tallying 
641 
rushing 
yards 

and eight touchdowns while 
catching seven passes for 107 
yards and two touchdowns.

Harbaugh 
supportive 
of 

Malone-Hatcher’s decision

The Wolverines experienced 

a recent — and unexpected — 
departure from the team when 
freshman defensive end Corey 
Malone-Hatcher 
announced July 4 
that he would be 
medically retiring 
from football.

In a statement 

posted to Twitter, 
Malone-Hatcher 
cited an arduous 
and 
longer-

than-expected 
recovery from an 
Achilles 
injury 

suffered during high school as 
the reason for taking a medical 
exemption. It was a decision 
that 
was 
made 
with 
input 

from Michigan’s training staff 
and 
doctors, 
and 
Harbaugh 

expressed his support for the 
decision Monday afternoon.

“I 
support 
it 
from 
the 

standpoint 
of 
being 
very 

supportive 
of 
what 
Corey 

and the doctors thought was 
best,” Harbaugh said. “... It’s a 
disappointment for his family, 
for him, for us coaches, for 
everybody concerned in terms of 
football, there (were) high hopes 
there.

“But as he said — and I 

thought he said 
it very well — you 
can still get a 
great education, 
can 
still 
be 
a 

great 
Michigan 

man and be able 
to participate as 
a 
student-intern 

if he so chooses, 
so there’s other 
ways that he can 
contribute.”

Malone-Hatcher, ranked as 

a four-star recruit according 
to 247Sports, enrolled early 
in January and took part in 
spring practices. He was not 
expected 
to 
contribute 
this 

year, though he would’ve had 
an opportunity to provide depth 
along a relatively young and 
inexperienced defensive line.

Michigan’s non-conference schedule released for 2017 season

The Michigan basketball team 

released its 2017 non-conference 
schedule Monday, a 13-game slate 
which features a trip to Hawaii 
for the Maui Invitational as well 
as a showdown with defending 
national 
champion 
North 

Carolina.

Just as they did last season, 

the Wolverines will play only 
one exhibition game, on Nov. 
3, against Division II opponent 
Grand Valley State. Michigan 
took on Armstrong State in an 
exhibition matchup in 2016.

The 
Wolverines 
normally 

begin the regular season with less 
challenging competition: They 
took on mid-major opponents 
Howard and IUPUI last season, 
and faced Northern Michigan 
and Elon two years ago. Michigan 
will continue that trend this 
season, as it opens regular-season 
play against North Florida (Nov. 
11), Central Michigan (Nov. 16) 
and Southern Mississippi (Nov. 
19) — teams that combined to go 
40-57 last season.

Up next for the Wolverines is 

the Maui Invitational. The eight-

team tournament, which includes 
Michigan, California, Louisiana 
State, Marquette, Notre Dame, 
Virginia 
Commonwealth 
and 

Wichita State, as well as hosts 
Chaminade, will take place Nov. 
20-22 at the Lahaina Civic Center. 
Michigan will play three games 
at the invitational, starting with 
a matchup against LSU.

The Wolverines last competed 

in the Maui Invitational in 2011, 
placing third. Michigan has made 
the trip to Hawaii five previous 
times, and won the tournament 
in 1985 and 1988.

This year’s Maui Invitational 

field 
includes 
five 
teams 
— 

Michigan, 
Marquette, 
Notre 

Dame, Virginia Commonwealth 
and Wichita State — that qualified 
for the NCAA Tournament last 
season.

“The 
Maui 
Invitational 
is 

going to give us an early season 
challenge,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein in a statement. 
“The trip will not only serve as 
a great bonding experience, but 
three games in three days against 
quality opponents will only serve 
us well preparing for the Big Ten 
and postseason.”

Perhaps the biggest test for 

the Wolverines will be the ACC/
Big Ten Challenge on Nov. 29. 
Michigan will travel to Chapel 
Hill, N.C. to take on defending 
national 
champion 
North 

Carolina. The Wolverines have 
a 2-3 all-time record against the 
Tar Heels.

On Dec. 9, Michigan will play 

host to UCLA, who defeated the 
Wolverines in Los Angeles last 
December in the first game of 
the home-and-home series. The 
Bruins, who went 31-5 last season 
and bring in the No. 4 recruiting 
class in the country according 
to ESPN, should be another 
formidable test.

Michigan’s toughest remaining 

non-conference 
game 
will 

likely come at Texas on Dec. 12, 
which is also the second half of 
a home-and-home series. The 
Longhorns struggled last season 
and finished just 11-22. However, 
their recruiting class — which 
includes five-star power forward 
Mo Bamba, who chose Texas over 
Michigan, Kentucky and Duke — 
is ranked fifth in the nation by 
ESPN.

The Wolverines’ other non-

conference games are against 
UC Riverside (Nov. 26), Detroit 

Mercy (Dec. 16), Alabama A&M 
(Dec. 21) and Jacksonville (Dec. 
30). The neutral-site showdown 
with the Titans might be the most 
meaningful: The Titans are led by 
former Michigan assistant coach 
Bacari Alexander, who is going 
into his second season as head 
coach, and the game will be the 
first college basketball game ever 
played at Little Caesar’s Arena, 
the newly built home of the NBA’s 
Detroit Pistons and the NHL’s 
Detroit Red Wings.

Overall, the Wolverines’ non-

conference 
schedule 
strength 

stacks up favorably to its 2016 slate. 
Including potential opponents in 
the Maui Invitational, Michigan’s 
opponents 
had 
an 
average 

KenPom rating — an advanced 
metric that measures a team’s 
strength — of 155, compared to 171 
last season. The Wolverines are 
also likely to face at least three 
Top 25 teams in non-conference 
play, compared to just one such 
team last season.

“We have always tried to 

schedule and play a competitive 
non-conference 
schedule,” 

Beilein said in a statement. 
“This season continues to live 
up to those expectations. We 

are really looking forward to the 
challenge.”

The 
2017-2018 
schedule 

comes with a few other changes 
compared to last season. The Big 
Ten Tournament will be held 
from Feb. 28-March 4 at Madison 
Square Garden in New York City 
— a week earlier than last season. 
As a result, Michigan will have a 
home and an away Big Ten game 
sometime between Dec. 1-Dec. 5. 
The Big Ten basketball schedules 
have not yet been released.

These changes mean that the 

Wolverines 
will 
have 
played 

15 games before New Year’s 
Day, a date by which they 
have usually played just 13 in 
years 
past. 
However, 
should 

Michigan qualify for the NCAA 
Tournament, it will have an extra 
week of rest, as the tournament 
does not begin until March 13.

While 
the 
Wolverines’ 

schedule features its share of 
“cupcake” opponents, perennial 
powers such as North Carolina, 
Texas and UCLA and the Maui 
Invitational should bolster their 
strength-of-schedule and give 
them crucial experience against 
tough competition leading up to 
Big Ten play.

“In terms of 
football, there 

(were) high 
hopes there.”
