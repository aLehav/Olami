Representatives 
from 
the 

Lecturers’ Employee Organization, 
the union representing lecturers, 
archivists and librarians across 
all three University of Michigan 
campuses, announced in a press 
release on Sept. 13 that they have 
reached a tentative agreement with 
the University’s administration 
after nine months of negotiations.

The 
tentative 
agreement 

includes a $51,000 starting salary 
for lecturers on all three University 
campuses starting in the 2023-
2024 school year. The salary 
increase is a $10,000 jump for 
lecturers on the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses, fulfilling one of LEO’s 
demands for pay parity across all 
three campuses. 

“In addition to the historic 

victory in minimum salaries, the 
contract would include longevity 
raises, 
increased 
job 
security 

provisions, enhanced sick pay, and 
teaching professor titles for longer 
serving lecturers,” the press release 
reads. 

Contract negotiations between 

LEO and the University had up 
to this point been unsuccessful, 
primarily due to disagreements 
over LEO’s demands for pay parity 
across the three U-M campuses. 
On Aug. 9, LEO members voted to 
quit their current contract with 
the University, meaning they were 
no longer contractually prohibited 
from going on strike 30 days after 
the vote.

In a march on campus shortly 

after the union announced its 
decision to quit the contract, the 
organization’s 
members 
were 

joined by lecturers, students and 
community members in support of 
their demands. 

Following further negotiations, 

LEO members voted to extend 
their contract with the University 
to Sept. 15 from Sept. 8, when it was 
originally set to expire, with hopes 
of reaching an agreement without a 
strike. The Sept. 13 announcement 
comes just two days before the 
deadline.

The Michigan Daily conducted a 

data analysis in April 2021 showing 
a historical trend of pay disparity 
between the Ann Arbor, Dearborn 
and Flint campuses over the last 19 
years. 

Dominick 
Fanelli, 
chief 

negotiator for the University, wrote 
in a statement obtained by The 
Daily that the tentative agreement 
represents a win for both LEO and 
the University’s administration. 

“We are pleased to have 

reached 
an 
agreement 
that 

provides 
a 
fair 
salary 
and 

maintains the university’s goal 
of 
providing 
much 
needed 

flexibility in benefits, as well 
as 
continuing 
security 
for 

lecturers,” Fanelli wrote. 

LEO president Kristen Herold 

wrote in the release that while 
all of LEO’s demands are not 
being met by the new contract, 
the contract signifies a historic 
gain for the union. 

Student 
organizers 
who 

intended to live at the new 
The One Ann Arbor apartment 
complex delivered an open 
letter to the University of 
Michigan dean of students on 
Sept. 10. The group is asking 
the University to help provide 
support for the more than 
600 displaced students who 
planned to live at The One this 
school year.

The 
One 
is 
a 
newly 

constructed 
off-campus 

housing development located 
on Pontiac Trail in Ann Arbor, 
over two miles away from 
Central Campus. Most of its 
tenants are students, who were 
notified on Aug. 19 — five days 
prior to their expected move-
in date — of construction 
delays that would push back 
their move-in date to Sep. 9. 

Ten days later on Aug. 29, 

tenants were again told that 
more 
delays 
have 
further 

pushed back their move-in 

date, 
leaving 
U-M 
student 

tenants still unable to live in 
the apartment complex one day 
before the first day of classes.

John Harris, principal at 

Trinitas Ventures, the parent 
company of The One, told 
The Michigan Daily in an 
email Wednesday that The 
One received nine temporary 
certificates of occupancy Sept. 
8 and had 45 students move 
into the complex Sept. 9.

Harris didn’t immediately 

reply to request for comment 
when asked about the latest 

tenant open letter to the U-M 
Dean of Students office or 
about 
former 
and 
current 

tenants’ continued concerns.

When speaking about the 

experience, LSA senior Krystal 
Webb, a former tenant who 
terminated her lease, said she 
felt stressed with the constant 
uncertainty of her temporary 
living situation. She also said 
she felt that the whole ordeal 
was taking a negative toll on 
her mental health.

Michigan Stadium opened its 

gates on Sept. 4 to more than 
100,000 fans eager to see the 
Wolverines take on Western 
Michigan University live and in 
action. 

Some University of Michigan 

community members and Ann 
Arbor residents, though, have 
expressed concerns that the 
upcoming season and events 
associated with it will heighten 
the spread of COVID-19 as cases 
rise.

Following the 2020 season, 

which halted ticket sales to the 
general public and introduced a 
conference-only game schedule, 
the 
University 
released 
a 

comparatively lenient set of 
health protocols for the 2021 
season. 

According to the University’s 

Athletics Face Covering Policy, 
which was last updated on Aug. 
18, capacities at home athletic 
events are not to be reduced. 
Fans are also encouraged, but 
not required, to wear masks in 
the outdoor stadium sections. 
Guests are required to wear 
face coverings when in any 

indoor area, regardless of their 
vaccination status.

University spokesperson Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
to The Michigan Daily that 
while the University’s academic 
missions continue to be their top 
priority, Michigan football is an 
important part of Ann Arbor’s 
community culture. 

“We 
have 
worked 
with 

medical 
experts 
across 
the 

university 
and 
state 
and 

local governments to find a 
balance 
that 
allows 
events 

and gatherings to continue on 
campus while still providing a 
safe atmosphere,” Broekhuizen 

wrote. 
“(Athletic 
Director 

Warde) Manuel has been a 
relentless advocate for the safety 
of our student-athletes.”

The University is keeping 

a close eye on the spread of 
COVID-19, Broekhuizen wrote, 
especially on cases stemming 
from community events.

“We will continue to monitor 

viral activity closely, especially 
in relation to games and other 
large 
events, 
and 
will 
not 

hesitate to adjust the policy as 
needed,” Broekhuizen said.

The University of Michigan has 

approved 662 vaccine exemptions, 
less than 2% of the Ann Arbor 
campus’ 
student 
population, 

and 
denied 
an 
additional 
95 

exemptions, according to University 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald. 

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Fitzgerald wrote that each 
exemption was evaluated on an 
individual basis. 

“Exemption 
requests 
are 

reviewed by designated U-M staff 
members from a number of units, 
including University Health Service, 
Student Life, Human Resources and 
Occupational Health Services, as 
well as representatives from all three 
campuses and the health system, 
when appropriate,” Fitzgerald wrote. 

On July 30, University President 

Mark Schlissel announced that 
faculty, staff and students across all 
three University campuses, as well as 
Michigan Medicine, were required 
to be fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19 by the first day of classes. 

Schlissel’s 
announcement 

included “limited” religious and 
medical 
exemptions 
subject 
to 

University 
approval. 
Individuals 

with exemptions have to participate 
in mandatory weekly COVID-19 
testing.

As of Sept. 8, 93% of students 

have reported their full vaccination 
sequence. According to Fitzgerald, 
the remaining 5% of students 
who have not self-reported a full 
vaccination nor been given an 
exemption 
are 
either 
partially 

vaccinated or in the process of 
requesting an exemption.

79% of staff and 92% of faculty 

on the Ann Arbor campus have also 
reported their full vaccination.

Students who have not reported 

their vaccination status and have 
not received an exemption or a 
deferment had an administrative 
hold placed on their account starting 
Aug. 30. 

Fitzgerald wrote the majority of 

vaccine exemptions granted by the 
University were religious. In order 
to receive a religious exemption, 
students had to prove that getting the 
vaccine violated their sincerely-held 
religious view in a written statement 
and complete the COVID-19 safety 
module.

Engineering 
senior 
Brannon 

Kincaid said he applied for a religious 
exemption that has since been 
approved by the University. Kincaid 
said he spent time praying and 
decided now was not the right time 
to get a vaccine. 

“Basically everything that you do 

(in Christianity) is to glorify God in 
a way, and to go to God and pray for 
most decisions,” Kincaid said. “And 
basically, for me personally, I had 
prayed about it, and at that point in 
time I just decided it wasn’t the right 
thing for me to do.” 

Kincaid said the process of 

receiving 
an 
exemption 
was 

relatively straightforward, though 
he said there were some confusing 
aspects of applying for one. Kincaid 
said after applying on Aug. 4, 
he didn’t hear anything until 
Aug. 19, when he learned that his 
exemption had been approved on 
the condition that he complete a 
COVID-19 safety module.

ACADEMICS
Students face another semester outside the 
classroom with virtual, outdoor classes
Concerns about the delta variant prompt instructors to change course formats 

Though 91% of University 

of Michigan courses are being 
taught in-person this semester, 
some students are still learning 
in 
alternative 
formats 
— 

including online or outdoors — 
due to concerns over teaching 
in small classrooms as the 
more contagious delta variant 
continues to spread.

LSA freshman Sam Gomez, 

who is taking an outdoors 
class this semester, was among 
those most looking forward to 
getting as normal of a college 
experience as possible in the 
age of COVID-19.

“I 
was 
very 
optimistic 

— when you searched for 
in-person classes, most classes 
would pop up,” Gomez said. “I 
was really excited that I’d be 

able to walk the campus and 

be able to experience it more or 
less in the way that a student 
would on a normal year.”

To 
Gomez’s 
surprise, 

“in-person” for English 223 did 
not mean learning in Mason 
Hall, the class’s location on the 
LSA course guide. After first 
meeting in the confined space 
of a classroom, lecturer Molly 
Lynch decided to move the 
English class outside for both 
creativity and safety reasons, 
she told The Daily.

“For the most part, people 

would like to be outside in 
the nice weather, especially 
in a creative writing class,” 
Lynch said. “But the COVID 
safety aspect of it was my main 
motivation, because I don’t 
know how well ventilated each 
classroom is.”

Over the past two weeks, 

Lynch has made use of spaces 
available throughout Central 
Campus, teaching her courses 
across from Hill Auditorium, 
outside the North University 
Building 
and 
even 
in 
the 

University Museum of Modern 
Art.

“There’s 
plenty 
of 

opportunity 
for 
outdoor 

classrooms,” Lynch said. “Our 
campus has a lot of spaces 
where that can be done and 
done in a way in which teachers 
just kind of use what appears 
to be available.”

Learning 
in 
these 

unconventional 
locations 

has 
helped 
Gomez 
grow 

accustomed to campus while 
tapping into his creative side 
— something that is much 
more difficult in a windowless 
Mason Hall classroom, he said.

“I feel like I’m a lot more 

in touch with things,” Gomez 
said. “I know that for some 
situations, being outside can 
make a classroom environment 
more difficult, but in a creative 
class such as this one, it feels 
like you’re in your element a bit 
more.”

The 
only 
downside, 

Gomez said, is the occasional 
interruption, whether it be 
the bell tower’s quarter-hour 
chime or a friend unknowingly 
disrupting the class.

Though 
Gomez 
and 
his 

classmates are tackling school 
in a brand-new setting, others 
have returned to the all-
too-familiar Zoom calls for 
hybrid and virtual classes this 
semester.

Despite 
having 
the 

option to teach in person, 
Anna Edmonds, lecturer of 
philosophy, opted for virtual 
lectures 
with 
in-person 

discussions 
due 
to 
space 

limitations on campus.

“Given that it seemed like 

a pretty high possibility that 
we would end up with a much 
worse lecture time in possibly 
not a very good space, I elected 
to stay online,” Edmonds said. 

Edmonds said the return 

to virtual instruction is not 
a setback but instead offers a 
variety of ways to keep students 
engaged 
during 
lectures. 

Edmonds said the chat function 
has been especially helpful 
for facilitating participation 
during lectures.

“I really love being able to 

glance over at the chat and 
see the kind of comments and 
questions people are asking 
there,” Edmonds said. “It’s a 
pretty low bar for entry into 
class participation … I already 
know that the person who’s 
written in it has something to 
say, so there’s no sort of danger 
of scary cold-calling.”

Students have so far enjoyed 

the freedom that comes with 
recorded lectures, Edmonds 
said.

“It seemed fairly plausible 

that 
having 
the 
recorded 

lectures to be able to go back 
and watch, as well as taking 
exams in a setting where you 
were by yourself and not elbow-
to-elbow in the auditorium, 
were helpful,” Edmonds said.

Edmonds 
and 
Lynch 

emphasized the importance 
of continuing to prioritize 
students’ mental health.

“I acknowledge the kind 

of 
awkwardness, 
difficulty 

and challenges that we may 
potentially be facing,” Lynch 
said. “I put a huge amount of 
emphasis in my teaching on 
student mental health — it’s 

very prominent in my syllabi, 
so students are aware of the 
services that are available to 
them.”

Engineering 
junior 

Anna 
Kilts 
said 
virtual 

classes definitely have their 
advantages when it comes to 
freedom and time management.

“It’s really nice to take my 

class wherever,” Kilts said. 
“I don’t actually have to go 
anywhere, so my Tuesdays are 
very relaxing.”

On other days when she has 

hybrid classes, Kilts said she 
loses this luxury of working 
wherever is convenient.

“The only difficulty with 

hybrid (classes) is scheduling,” 
Kilts 
said. 
“My 
discussion 

section is ten minutes after 
my lecture, so I have to do the 
online lecture somewhere on 
campus to get to my classroom 
time.”

Still, Kilts said she hopes 

students stay safe and follow 
the 
University 
COVID-19 

protocols set in place so that 
next semester is more similar 
to 
a 
pre-pandemic 
college 

experience.

“I just hope that, as a whole, 

the student body continues 
to be safe and smart with the 
decisions that they’re making,” 
Kilts said. “Obviously, being in 
person is really exciting, but 
we’re only going to be able to 
continue to have in-person 
classes 
and 
in-person 

opportunities as long as people 
are making smart decisions.”

“I literally lost so much sleep 

those nights because I didn’t 
know if they were going to put 
me in a hotel,” Webb said. “They 
weren’t telling us. Just recently, I 
decided I couldn’t do it anymore. 
It just felt like a game, because 
I’m sure that they know that the 
move-in dates couldn’t happen 
on those days. But they were still 
giving us false hope.”

Organizers are requesting that 

the University issue a statement to 
The One regarding its treatment 
of U-M students and that the 
University cut its advertising ties 
with The One by removing ads for 
the complex on the off-campus 
housing website Beyond the Diag. 

Conrad 
Kosowsky, 
fourth 

year PhD student and one of the 
organizers of the letter, said he 
felt that the University shouldn’t 
be 
advertising 
housing 
that 

doesn’t exist. 

“I think it’s really bad of 

the University to be providing 
a platform for an apartment 
complex when that complex is 

treating university students so 
incredibly poorly.”

They are also asking the 

University to provide tenants 
with meal swipes at dining 
halls. According to the letter, 
“a 
representative 
survey 
of 

tenants” showed that over 50% of 
respondents have skipped meals 
and/or school-related events to 
save money. 

“It appears that hundreds of 

students have not yet received 
their promised stipends from The 
One and therefore cannot use 
that money to purchase food,” the 
letter reads.

Webb said that when she 

contacted the Dean of Students 
to obtain meal card swipes for 
tenants who were living in hotels, 
she was met with unreasonable 
options 
and 
little 
support, 

especially for students given 
hotels in farther cities.

“‘The One is giving you $50 a 

day. You can use that,’” Webb said 
the Dean of Students told her. 
“But for some people who were 
out in Canton and Livonia, that’s 
not really a viable option because 
they have to use that $50 a day to 
get to campus.”

Other 
requests 
included 

encouraging faculty to create 
virtual learning opportunities for 
students who are commuting to 
campus or staying in hotels due 
to their housing displacement, 
as well as providing alternative 
transportation 
resources 
for 

tenants. The One has provided a 
shuttle service to get to campus; 
however, 
organizers 
say 
the 

shuttle timing is unreliable.

“The 
One 
has 
offered 

inconsistent and poorly timed 
shuttle service to its current 
tenants, with long, unscheduled 
wait times and some routes 
taking well over an hour to arrive 
on campus,” the letter reads.

Given 
these 
and 
other 

difficulties, 
70% 
of 
survey 

respondents reported that “the 
emotional 
distress 
from 
the 

delay will affect their academic 
performance,” according to the 
open letter. 

“At this difficult time, we need 

you to advocate for us,” the letter 
reads. “University students were 
pressured (78% of respondents); 
given 
inadequate 
information 

or insufficient time (98% of 
respondents); and had days when 

they didn’t know where they 
would stay (70% of respondents).”

Kosowsky said the University 

should provide transportation 
resources like Blue Buses or 
parking passes for the students 
who commute 20-30 miles away 
from campus. So far, Kosowsky 
said the University hasn’t been 
helpful with regards to parking. 

“One of the students who 

helped deliver the letter today 
tried to get a parking pass,” 
Kosowsky said of a commuter 
who was ineligible for a parking 
pass and was unable to get special 
permission from the parking 
office. “So now he doesn’t have a 
great place to park his car when 
he drives to campus, which he 
needs to do because the shuttles 
don’t run frequently.”

The letter currently has 312 

signatures, 
and 
organizers 

reported that around 250 tenants 
have contacted each other on 
social media to support each 
other.

CAMPUS LIFE
Freshman creates unofficial 

Blue Bus tracking app

Akinci programmed ‘M-Bus’after frustrations with ‘U’ app

Engineering 
freshman 
Efe 

Akinci, an Ann Arbor native, 
struggled 
to 
navigate 
the 

University of Michigan’s Magic 
Bus application last year and 
decided to do something about it. 

So this past summer, Akinci 

designed and programmed his 
own unofficial app — M-Bus — 
that tracks when buses arrive in 
real-time.

“(The 
University-affiliated 

app Magic Bus) just loads their 
webpage, so it feels a little clunky 
because it’s basically a webpage 
in an app,” Akinci said. “I wanted 
to make my own so that when I 
came (to Michigan) I would be 
able to find bus stops and buses 
and have a better experience with 
it.”

Akinci said he spent two weeks 

creating the app and then made 
it available for download on the 
App Store and Google Play. Akinci 
then shared his app with close 
friends and posted to the U-M 
subreddit promoting his app. 
Soon enough, downloads for the 
app began to increase. 

“I was expecting like twenty 

or thirty people to download it,” 
Ackinci said. “And then the first 
day I launched it, I think about 
650 people downloaded it, which 
I was not expecting. I hadn’t 
made the app to handle that, and 
the app crashed on its first day.”

Since 
then, 
Akinci 
has 

reworked 
the 
app 
to 
avoid 

crashes.

“It’s not a very intensive 

program, at least on the back end, 
so I don’t see any reason why 
it wouldn’t be able to support 
every single person here using it,” 
Akinci said. 

The M-Bus app relies on 

Application 
Programming 

Interface data that the University 
acquired 
through 
its 
2020 

contract with Clever Devices, 
the 
supplier 
that 
facilitated 

the switch from the previous 
University-affiliated app Double 
Map to Magic Bus. Akinci said he 
uses the same data the University 
uses, ensuring the app’s accuracy.

“As far as I can tell, (the 

contract) comes with a standard 
package that includes a developer 
API, so that’s what I’m using. It’s 
all standardized and very well 
documented,” Akinci said. “It 
comes from the same data that U 
of M uses.”

Moving forward, Akinci said 

he plans to change the app so 
that each time the University 
updates its bus routes, the app 
automatically adds the new routes 
without requiring users to update 
their app to the newest version. 

Since launching in August, 

Akinci’s M-Bus has garnered 57 
ratings on the Apple App Store, 
with an average rating of 4.9 stars 
as of Sept. 8. 

Akinci’s 
frustrations 
with 

the University’s official bus app, 
Magic Bus, are shared among 
many of its users. When the 
University first launched Magic 
Bus in early 2020, students 
said the app’s features were not 
intuitive and bus positions were 
not always updated. 

LSA sophomore Jack Sweeting 

uses the U-M bus system a couple 
of times a week and switched 
from Magic Bus to M-Bus.

“I don’t use the (Michigan) 

Magic Bus app; I use the M-Bus 
app, which I’ve found is a bit more 
accurate than the official one by 
the school,” Sweeting said. “Even 
then sometimes the (M-Bus) app 
can be a little inaccurate on the 

timing. But it’s usually pretty 
helpful for knowing when a bus is 
going to be there.”

Sweeting also said he thinks 

the M-Bus app uses a more “user-
friendly interface,” compared to 
Magic Bus, which shows users 
more maps and screens. 

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore Carlos Pirela Romero 
regularly commutes from North 
to Central Campus and said he 
prefers to use Google Maps over 
the Magic Bus app because of its 
simplicity. Pirela Romero said he 
had not yet used M-Bus.

“I think Google Maps is more 

user-friendly than Magic (Bus),” 
Pirela Romera said. “Magic Bus 
has a lot of stats, a lot of drop-
down menus. It gets a little 
complicated.”

Currently, the app is run 

entirely by Akinci, who said he 
doesn’t earn profit from the app. 
Akinci said before launching, 
he received permission from 
the 
University’s 
Logistics, 

Transportation 
& 
Parking 

department to create the app. 

“I did ask if they were okay 

with the app existing, and they 
said they were fine with it as long 
as it had no U of M branding and 
I didn’t make money … from it,” 
Akinci said. “They know the app 
exists and they’re fine with it 
existing, which is really all that I 
can ask for.”

The 
University 
Logistics, 

Transportation 
& 
Parking 

department did not respond to 
requests for comment.

For the time being, Akinci said 

he plans to continue running 
the app but said he would not be 
opposed to handing the app over 
to other students in the future.

GOVERNMENT
Biden extends student loan 
moratorium to Jan. 2022

Program was initially supposed to end Sept. 2021

On Aug. 6, President Joe Biden 

announced his administration 
would be extending the student 
loan 
moratorium 
from 
the 

original end date in September 
2021, allowing borrowers to 
pause repayment until Jan. 31, 
2022. 

The loan moratorium initially 

began on March 13, 2020 and is 
a period of suspended federal 
loan payments, frozen interest 
rates for loans accruing interest 
and a pause on defaulted loan 
collection for borrowers across 
the country. 

The 
relief 
measures 
are 

selective and determined by 
the ownership of the loan, 
meaning only a subset of loans 
are “eligible” for this suspension. 
While 
defaulted 
and 
non-

defaulted loans owned by the 
U.S Department of Education, 
defaulted 
HEAL 
loans 
and 

non-defaulted Federal Family 
Education Loan (FFEL) Program 
loans all qualify for relief, 
commercially-owned 
lender 

loans, school-owned loans and 
private loans do not.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

targeted eligibility of student 
loan relief, CSG President Nithya 
Arun, a Public Health senior, 
questioned the selectivity.

“This 
is 
a 
demonstrated 

need,” Arun said. “I think it’s the 
government’s duty to cover that, 
especially because at the end of 
the day, you’d be investing in our 
economy in the long run. And I 
really don’t think there’s a need 
to be selective because we can 
cover the cost of it. It’s just that 
we choose not to.”

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, LSA junior and founder of 

U-M’s Students for Biden Andrew 
Schaeffler 
said 
he 
believes 

Biden’s plan is a great start in 
giving aid to those who need it 
most, especially considering the 
challenge of broadly canceling 
student debt.

“More broad-based student 

loan forgiveness could run into 
more legal problems, require 
legislative action or could be 
reduced by future Republican 
administrations, and taking it in 
a more nuanced and specific way 
is more important,” Schaeffler 
wrote. “In essence, this structure 
allows for those truly wronged by 
predatory lenders or other more 
urgent situations to be targeted 
and have their loans forgiven, a 
much more succinct process.”

In his statement from The 

White House, Biden said the 
current extension would be 
the final one. After Jan. 31, 
borrowers would have to be 
prepared to start repaying their 
loan payments.

Schaeffler said he believes the 

Biden administration’s timing 
and forgiveness measures of the 
extension was greatly needed 
given the pandemic.

“As job numbers continue to 

grow and the impacts of COVID-
19 continue to slowly subside, 
I believe that this extension 
is 
fair,” 
Schaeffler 
wrote. 

“However, as we get closer to 
January 2022, we will see how 
appropriate another extension 
would be; there is probably not 
a specific time that would be 
‘good’ to restart payments, so 
this timing, being a few months 
from now, is as good a time as 
possible.”

On this point, Arun said she 

disagrees with putting a cap on 
the moratorium. She said she 
believes decisions shouldn’t be 

made when the trajectory and 
full impact of the pandemic is 
unknown. Because loans are a 
significant burden even without 
the impacts of a pandemic, 
Arun said considering post-grad 
education in a time of COVID-
19 uncertainty is unknown and 
anxiety-inducing.

“I’m scared for myself in terms 

of post-grad,” Arun said. “I will 
not have the financial capability to 
just pay that in full without a loan. 
So that is something that provokes 
fear in me.”

Considering 
the 
Biden 

administration’s 
student 
debt 

forgiveness has topped $9.5 billion 
so far, Schaeffler said he believes 
Biden is ‘fully committed’ to 
achieving students’ loan relief and 
fighting for their education. 

“Biden 
supports 
and 
has 

proposed a legislative package that 
would include free undergraduate 
tuition 
for 
students 
from 

families who make less than 
$125,000,” 
Schaeffler 
wrote. 

“He has proposed nearly $800 
billion of spending pertaining to 
education, including $450 billion 
for child care and universal pre-
kindergarten programs, as well as 
funding for school infrastructure 
and free community college.”

Arun said given the Biden 

campaign’s support for immediate 
$10,000 forgiveness per student 
borrower, she believes Biden 
has still not delivered enough on 
forgiving student loans.

“That was one of his promises 

and he still hasn’t followed 
through 
on 
that 
campaign 

promise,” Arun said. “I think there 
is room in the budget to cover the 
cost of education, especially higher 
education.”

In 2021, like in years before, the writers of 

The Michigan Daily Arts are stretching out their 
hammies to participate in a grueling challenge 
of mental fortitude and physical fitness: the Ann 
Arbor Probility Marathon. A little pretentious, a 
little weird, The Daily team is a mix of seasoned 
athletes and … less seasoned athletes. For the 
sake of journalism and prestige, The Daily’s 
tenacious review-writing gremlins are closing 
their laptops, tying up their Brooks and hitting 
the Ann Arbor pavement. Non-gremlin but 
marathon-interested University of Michigan 
students can join the marathon with the discount 
code “Goblue25.”

Brenna “I hate running, but I’ll die before 
I’m bad at it” Goss

I’ve wanted to learn how to run ever since 

I was forced to run a mile in sixth grade gym 
class. I knew it was coming weeks ahead 
of time, but I didn’t bother to prepare for it. 
After all, I was spending 20 hours per week 
in my dance studio, training for competitions 
and a potential future career — how much 
harder could running be? Unfortunately, 
I didn’t get the answer I was looking for. I 
made it one lap around the field before I gave 
up and just started walking. Unable to stand 
being terrible at anything, I started training 
in fits and spurts. But although my mile times 
gradually got shorter, I never made it more 
than a month before giving up on the whole 
idea, only to have to start all over again when 
I got my motivation back. The problem was, I 
just hated running. I hated the feeling of my 
heart constricting painfully in my chest, my 
throat dry and scraping. I hated the cramps 
that would wedge themselves down through 
my shoulder and up under my ribs. In the end, 
my desire to improve was never stronger than 
my desire to just avoid it all.

But, for better or for worse, I’m a stubborn 

person. I’ve never been one to let things go 
easily. And no matter how much my body 
shouts at me that it’s just not meant for cardio, 
I am determined to prove it wrong. Even if I 
nearly passed out while forcing myself to the 
peak of a 14,265-foot mountain. Even if my 
heart was beating 195 bpm while climbing 
up Colorado’s sand dunes. Even if running 
makes me feel like I’m always just a couple of 
steps away from a heart attack. If my body is 
the instrument through which I experience 
the world, then it better be well prepared to do 
everything I’m going to ask of it.

I made up my mind in sixth grade, and even 

a decade later, I haven’t forgotten it: I’m going 
to learn how to run.

Elizabeth “I have asthma, but I’m not 
asthmatic” Yoon

Within our lives, we live out little loops, 

becoming certain kinds of people defined 
for a moment by our fascinations. Soccer 
player, high school debater, school doer. Our 
pet obsessions and interests memorialize 
and drive our outward presentation. It is, in 
part, subconscious while also a sustained 
performance. Who we are (how we are 
perceived and how we envision ourselves) is 
tied to our own baked-in idiosyncrasies. They 
are the result of compounded habits and tics.

The graphic novel “Habibi” by Craig 

Thompson illustrates this well. Toward the 
end of the novel, Thompson has a visual 
spread of the many different lives the main 
characters have lived. You see the characters 
as children, teenagers and young adults. Each 
iteration is drastically different, adapted to 
changing circumstances and lifestyles. Their 
lives were trying yet expansive and different: 
constantly changing, evolving, devolving 
and mobile. I want the same. I want to 
look back and see my life segmented 
into vibrant and distinct phases.

Thus, I run the marathon to 

reboot myself post COVID-19. 

I want to build new habits and 

successfully merge the athlete I was in 
high school with the more sedentary 
co-ed I am now. I want to make use of 
my many sports bras and evolve myself 
into two things: a person who rises early 
and a person who can gleefully run seven 
miles. The first goal is already in the process 
of coming true. My summer morning 
commute had me very begrudgingly 
trudging out of bed at 6:30 a.m. While I am not 
yet gleeful (and have also not started running 
more than two miles), I am very hopeful that 
by October, I will have enough lung capacity to 
laugh while running my leg of the marathon 
relay. And if not laughing, armed with my 
inhaler, I will definitely be making some kind 
of laugh-adjacent, strangled wheezing noise.

Kaitlyn “Retired middle school track star” 
Fox

The start of my running career dates back 

to sixth grade when my ex-Marine officer 
gym coach approached me after the infamous 
PACER test and said, “Fox, I’m recruiting you 
for the 4×100 relay.” I didn’t particularly enjoy 
running at the time, but I was terrified of 
saying no to the coach that ordered burpees left 

and right and had scrawny middle schoolers 
flipping tires across the school soccer field. 

I quickly discovered that I was actually a 

decent runner after our relay team wound up 
winning the local conference championship. 
My middle school running career was short-
lived, however, when I came down with 
pneumonia in the seventh grade, putting me 
on the sidelines for nearly two years as my 
lungs recovered. 

While running never became my main sport 

(I ended up dedicating myself to tennis in high 
school), I continued racing on my own time, 
even logging a few miles before tennis practices 
and running my first half marathon before my 
senior season. 

Nowadays, finding the time and energy to 

maintain my fitness is a challenge, and I’m not 
always eager as I was in high school to lace up 
my shoes and hit the road. But I’ve stuck with 
it because running is a constant challenge, and 
I want to 
conquer it. 

As a type 
3 
on 
the 

Enneagram 
(aka 
the 
“achiever”), 

running 
presents 
an 
amazing 

opportunity to strive for more and work on 
bettering myself. I love the prospect of adding 
extra miles to my weekly mileage, beating my 
personal records and watching my body adapt 
to the challenges of running. Even when my 
legs feel stiff and lungs burn, I know that pain 
is turning me into a better, stronger athlete. 

To put it plainly, I love the “running 

aesthetic.” I love waking up before the rest 
of the world to go for a long run. I live for the 
adrenaline rush before a race. I’m secretly 
proud when someone tells me I’m crazy 
for enjoying running. I chuckle at running 
memes, and I love the wholesomeness of the 
running community.

Darby “Inclement weather be damned” 
Williams

I took up running out of necessity.
My senior year of high school was a disaster 

of tempestuous proportions. Literally. Two 
months into the school year my school and 
home in the U.S. Virgin Islands were hit by 
two Category 5 hurricanes. I was forced to 
evacuate and live in Utah with my two little 
sisters for the remainder of my senior year. 
All in all, I spent eight months sleeping on a 
deflated air mattress in the living room of my 
grandparents’ basement. 

That year brought with it six college 

rejections, a string of chronic migraines and 
the worst heartbreak of my life. Senior year 
was as much an exercise in resilience as it was 
an exercise in rejection. At its culmination, I 
was left completely directionless. 

I took up running because I needed 

something to reach for. I signed up for a half 
marathon, despite only having run eight miles 
before. I trained and trained and trained. I 

spent hours in the summer sun, sometimes 

leaving the track at 10 p.m. Looking back, 
my first race time was nothing to write 

home about. Nevertheless, it left me 
with a small pink medal, copious 
blisters and the gift of something I 
thought I had lost long ago: purpose. 

I signed up for another race. And 

another. During my gap year, I ran 

five half marathons. Running afforded 
me the luxury of losing myself in the 
act of progress for progress’s sake. 
The beauty of running, for me, was in 
the sheer joy of moving forward. Speed 
and direction became secondary as I lost 

myself in the thrill of the race. 

Running taught me the power of being 

present. In past years, I had defined myself 
through past failures and future anxieties. 
In the time I trained, I was able to focus on 
the things that brought me joy and fulfillment. 
I taught at an elementary school, I acted 
in Shakespearean plays, I sang. I left the 
heartbreak, the rejection letters and that 
shitty deflated mattress in my wake. 

Amid the storm-stricken debris of my past 

aspirations, I finally found my footing, and 
having done so, I did what runners do best. 

I moved forward.

Gigi “Send help — lost on a sidewalk 
somewhere in the Midwest” Guida

When I first arrived in Ann Arbor, and for 

many months after, I had no idea where the 
heck I was. 

Before freshman move-in, I’d lived on the 

same block of Center City Philadelphia my 

whole life. My family had moved only once, 
when I was a far-from-cognizant newborn, 
from a rowhouse on one end of our block to an 
identical rowhouse a few doors down. Eighteen 
years later, I moved again. This time, not a few 
doors down, but to a Midwestern college town. 
Driving through flat farmland, turning on 
Washtenaw Avenue and walking up the steps 
of South Quad, I entered what would become 
more than a momentary state of geographic 
and cultural disorientation.

In a way I hadn’t predicted, I had a hard 

time making sense of Ann Arbor. Where was 
I? Would you call it a town? A suburb, maybe? 
Certainly not a city like I had been told. Where 
were all the elderly people, the kids younger 
than college-aged? Or was the whole place a 
large-scale hotel for transient 20-something-
year-olds who came and went? Where were 
the parks? The old buildings? The gathering 
spaces? What did it mean to live here? I didn’t 
know, but I was doing it anyway. I was lost in 
space, without a sense of place and, for a long 
time, Ann Arbor didn’t feel like home.

It wasn’t until the spring of 2020 that 

this began to change when, in a moment of 
pandemic hysteria, I began training for my 
first marathon. During that time, my runs 
were vital nutrients to my everyday sanity; they 
were a surefire method of escape, a delicious 
departure from Zoom and my bedroom desk. 
Crucially, my daily run also became an essential 
cartographic tool; running in and around Ann 
Arbor was when I finally came to know it.

Carried by my own two legs, I found forests, 

parks, cabins, farms, deer and a gated mansion 
or two. I ran through yellow sassafras leaves and 
underneath snowy branches. Herons skulked 
on the banks of the Huron River, robins and blue 
jays fluttered across the path in front of me. Far 
away from my hometown, I saw brightly colored 
townhouses with front and back porches, cabins 
made of varnished wood, an old church, now 
refurbished and residential, a grand stained-
glass window letting light into a living room.

Notably, I got lost all the time. Outrageously 

lost. Scarily lost! A certain sort of I-don’t-have-
my-phone-the-sun-is-setting-and-I’m-on-
a-dirt-road lost. But as I got more and more 
lost in the Ann Arbor landscape (and do 
brace yourself for the incoming cliché), I was 
starting to understand exactly where I was.

I ran my marathon in December 2020 in 

Philly. I finished Rocky-style at the top of the 
Art Museum steps. I hugged my mom, I looked 
out at the sunset and the skyline, I totally cried. 
Months later, in Ann Arbor now, I’m still 
running, still reorienting. 

There are some musicians whose performances make 

you forget where your body ends and the music begins; 
they connect with the crowd so deeply that you feel rooted 
in your current moment. This energy was palpable at Theo 
Katzman’s Sonic Lunch concert in downtown Ann Arbor 
on Sept. 2, for which May Erlewine opened. The same 
friendly electricity was palpable in a long Zoom chat with 
The Daily.

Katzman’s engaging manner in conversation felt akin to 

the way he pulls his listeners in: He asks them to become 
part of his musical world and volunteers his emotions so 
that they might find something similar stirring within 
themselves. “I’ve noticed that people that are fans, they 
often sing all the words,” he shared. “It’s really cool, 
because it’s like, they’re resonating with that, too.”

And indeed, at the Sonic Lunch, the crowd gleefully 

sang along. At first, there was the hesitance that people 
seem to find themselves submerged in at outdoor concerts 
sometimes, as these so often feel less formal, and you are 
aware that pedestrians crossing can see you dancing and 
singing. Katzman encouraged the crowd to break out of 
the everyday setting we had found ourselves in, until we 
couldn’t help but twist our hands up into the air to his funk-
rock, singing his own feelings back at him and laughing at 
his occasional dialogue delivery of the lyrics.

This return to his college town carried a good bit of 

significance and happy memories for Katzman, saying 
“I think I can basically trace every gig I’ve gotten as a 
professional musician back to just, like, hanging out in 
Kerrytown.” The 2007 U-M graduate still carries the 
community he found in Ann Arbor with him, saying that 
this school gave him friends all over the world. He met 
many of his bandmates from the funk band Vulfpeck 
through the jazz program here.

“A very innocent, beautiful time to be in Ann Arbor,” he 

reminisced. “We were making music on our own terms. It 
was like, so exciting to be a young person on your own for 
the first time.” In what I now recognized as a classically 
thoughtful Theo Katzman twist, he added, “I mean, I 
would imagine you’ve had a similar feeling.”

Of course, now Katzman is more cemented in his 

identity as a musician. “I definitely am a performer and 
… I feel like I’m my best self when I’m performing music,” 
Katzman said.

It was a discovery reached after a long year, one filled 

with gratitude for things after they’d been taken away, just 
like for so many of us. “That’s what this whole last year has 
been,” he pondered. “It’s like, man who really are you? And 
what’s important to you right now? And are you going to, 
like, double down on that? Or are you going to ignore it? 
And I don’t want to ignore it.” 

Facing yourself in such a manner is difficult, and 

sharing it with a whole crowd is an impressive level of 
vulnerability, but Katzman is nothing if not courageous.

His songs very often cover heartbreak and frustration: 

his last album Modern Johnny Sings: Songs in the Age 
of Vibe mixing political commentary (“You Could Be 
President”) with songs about bygone intimacy; his singing 
on “Fog In The Mirror” so soft you can tell he is walking 
through the memory. His music over the years has 

contained all sides of love, from the sharp panged euphoria 
of new love, to the feeling of a glowing soft-edged love that 
has existed for a long time and continues to exist. This 
love reaches further to the pile of sea glass and pieces of a 
heart that one resigned oneself to when originally opening 
oneself to love.

“My music isn’t separate from my life,” he said. “I’m not 

like that kind of artist … it would be cool if (I) were, maybe, 
but (I’m) not. It’s like I’m trying to accept more of just who 
I am and … how I am.”

This sort of thoughtfulness seems to translate intensely 

into his writing process. “I feel like I’m just compelled to 
write music and I’m compelled to think a lot about how I 
feel and I think sometimes that’s a trap because thinking 
can be a trap,” he admits.

But overall, music is omnipresent in his brain, whether 

he is writing it or not. As such, he strives to stay productive, 
allowing what is in him already to make an appearance 
in the world. “When I’m writing … I’m trying not to lead 
the music as much as follow it these days, because I think 
it’s, that’s part of the magic if you can kind of not close 
your mind off.” It is an almost generous sentiment from 
a musician who has learned, through time, that you don’t 
guide the music or the genius, it guides you.

Emotions, flaky paint colors that they are, so clearly 

guide him too. Writing music seems to be an almost 
therapeutic process of self-discovery for Katzman, as he 
often learns more about what he is thinking and feeling 
when trying to communicate it to others through music.

“I like when those emotions change while you’re 

writing a song. And sometimes you write a song (and) 
you’re like, this is about a person, you know, and then 
you’re thinking about (that) person. And then you realize, 
actually, this person is actually just symbolic. And then 
you’re like, ‘Oh, shit.’ I’m just personifying a feeling,” 
Katzman finishes, the casual tone making his piercing 
observations seem almost easy to come by. But in the 
end, this person he is writing about is a necessary part of 
the song, in order to properly create a chain of empathy 
between him and his listeners. 

Simply writing about the feeling itself would make it 

vague, open-ended, obvious. It can tell the listener what 
to feel, instead of allowing them to reflect and figure out 
why the song resonates with them. It might be different 
from what Katzman originally intended, but to him, this is 
something to be encouraged.

“I think it’s really cool when a song can mean different 

things to different people, based on how it feels to them, 
which is sometimes the challenge with lyrics,” Katzman 
said. “It’s challenging to write words that are specific 
enough to send a message but open enough to not direct 
it.”

There is a kind of generosity to statements such as these, 

a quality that seems to define Theo Katzman as a musician. 
What is music if not generous?

The kind of openness that defines his discography can 

be a form of giving of oneself.

“What’s the point of doing any of this? If we’re not 

dealing with real shit? And it doesn’t mean I want my music 
to be a bloodbath, you know?” he jokes, following up with, 
“But I’d like … there (to) be some blood.”

When we started the “Best of Summer” 

series last year, none of us expected that we 
would still have a hanging shadow of the 
pandemic looming over us. If anything, this 
series was created as a defense against the 
social brain rot brought out by constant screen 
interfacing and self-isolation. If there is one 
entity that can foster genuine connection 
without the need for physical immediacy, 
it’s music. With that in mind, here we are, 
one year later, still reeling from the effects of 
this separation but with possible hope on the 
horizon. As artists return to recording studios 
with the music they’ve created during the 
pandemic, the music beat is celebrating the 
return of new music with our favorite summer 
releases. 

Mood Valiant – Hiatus Kaiyote 

Never has outer space felt so realistic. 

Hiatus Kaiyote’s third album Mood Valiant 
grounds the strange and unfamiliar feeling 
of what is past the atmosphere, making it 
seem like something within our reach. By 
that, I don’t mean simple synths and voice 
alteration technology. Theirs is an album filled 
with intricately thought-out instrumentation 
that walks the line between jazz, R&B, funk, 
electronica and something undefinable. 
Their lead Nai Palm’s singing, which swoops 
between euphoric, daring, grooving and 
tender, is a highlight on the album, as usual. 
While the album is perhaps not as cohesive 
as their last masterpiece, it still makes strong 
use of their technical skill while remaining 
in empathetic touch with the listener. Songs 
like “Stone or Lavender” bring the listener to 
a reckoning with their insides, encouraging 
us that love is the difficult choice we should 
always make. Meanwhile, “Get Sun ft. Arthur 
Verocai” and “Chivalry Is Not Dead” really dig 
into it in completely different ways, displaying 
once again the insane range of this band. 
Because their music does not fit fully into any 
genre and is like none I’ve ever heard before, 
each album of theirs becomes a new world to 
explore. — Fia Kaminski, Daily Arts Writer

What do you get when you take the 

soulfulness and cryptic wordplay of Erykah 
Badu, a velvety smooth bassline, then add a 
taste of fusion jazz? Hiatus Kaiyote’s “Red 
Room.” This was my favorite song of the 
summer, by far. The production is stripped 
down to its bare minimum, the song builds but 
doesn’t necessarily change and the drumbeat 
is not busy at all; its simplicity is effective. 
“Red Room” showcases the artistry and skill 
of the band, since there is literally nowhere 
to hide, and everyone is heard. Frontwoman 
Nai Palm’s voice dances on top of the groove 
— there is something ritualistic about her 
vocal performance, like a shaman guiding 
you through an auditory hallucination. She’s 
not afraid to explore the edges of her register, 
and she finds beauty in the imperfections. The 
lyrics are hard to unravel but not meaningless. 
It’s poetry, and the words flow like a 
crystalline stream of consciousness. Sparse 
instrumentation and simplicity is a dangerous 
game in music, but “Red Room” definitely 
comes out on top. — Jason Zhang, Daily Arts

Solar Power – Lorde

Lorde’s release of Solar Power feels very 

timely given the current state of the world. As 
we emerge from isolation and embrace a “new 
normal,” Lorde has returned from her hiatus, 
giving us a fresh album that grapples with 
global issues while appreciating the beauty 
that we have left to cling to. 

Unlike the dark, somber mood of her 2017 

release Melodrama, Solar Power offers a sense 
of optimism and feels more commercial than 
any of her previous releases. But commercial 
doesn’t necessarily equate to being unoriginal. 
Produced with Jack Antonoff, who recently 
produced Taylor Swift’s cut-back indie albums 
folklore and evermore, Solar Power embraces 
simplicity and seeks clarity through poetic 
accounts of her ponderings over the climate 
crisis, her recent trip to Antarctica and her 
relationships — both romantic and familial. 

The album’s title track has become a summer 

anthem, a song that celebrates the natural world 
and sonically mimics the warmth of sun-filled 
summer days. With its inspiring retrospection 
and concern for the modern crises plaguing 
our world, Solar Power is not just a feel-good 
summer release — it is a call to action. — Kaitlyn 
Fox, Music Beat Editor 

Spiral – DARKSIDE

When news broke out that producer 

Nicolás Jaar and multi-instrumentalist Dave 
Harrington would be returning to their 
DARKSIDE project nearly 8 years after their 
debut record Psychic, expectations could not 
have been higher. 

The release of Psychic felt like a new 

discovery was just made in electronic music, 
with its murky textures being allowed to 
roam the liquid architecture provided by 
subterranean synth ambiance. 

Jaar in particular has continued to be a 

trailblazer in the genre for the years following. 

With their new release Spiral, DARKSIDE 

stick to their formula of synthetic mysticism. 
However, they do so with an entirely different 
aesthetic in mind. In fact, the respective 
album artwork between the two records 
perfectly highlights this distinction. Whereas 
Psychic sounds like an air bubble swirling in 
the darkness of a fog-imbued room, Spiral 
is lurking underneath the verdant foliage, 
slithering between the pockets of space 
provided by the leaves. It’s an album whose 
sound is allowed to ferment as sharp plucks of 
guitar give way to the encompassing hum of a 
singing bowl. It feels so in tune with a summer 
whose oppressive heat and humidity have 
often made it feel like you were swimming 
through the air. At the same time, there is also a 
certain pulse that the album seems to function 
under, whether it be a lone hi-hat count, a 
hard-hitting bass groove or just a steady 
thump of the kick. In this sense, Spiral feels 
like a living organism, with its heart-pounding 
away buried beneath the overgrowth. — Drew 
Gadbois, Music Senior Arts Editor 

Fatigue – L’Rain

Residing in an emotional state of limbo has 

never sounded more breathtakingly ethereal 
than it does on Brooklyn musician L’Rain’s 
latest album, Fatigue. The project arrived amid 
a summer spent balancing high expectations 
for normalcy with circumstances that often 
changed for the worse. It’s an odd space that 
we inhabit now, most of us not unscathed by 
the events of the last two years but willing to 
welcome hope and joy with open arms. On 
Fatigue’s opener “Fly, Die” a probing voice 
asks, “What have you done, to change?” L’Rain 
artfully unpacks this question, tying together 
the moments of chaos and peace that have 

defined her own fatigue into one cinematic 
listening experience. 

What is perhaps most special about 

Fatigue is the way that each song unfurls into 
something unexpected. The track “Find It” 
begins as a relatively spare arrangement of 
soft vocal loops and light synth, yet by its end 
 

crescendos into a soulful explosion of gospel 
choirs and church organs. “Two Face” leads 
with an incredible twist of hard-edged piano 
and percussion and descends into sparkling 
guitar and grooving bass. “Suck Teeth” flows 
between a more classic R&B bassline to almost 
eerie vocal delivery.

With her background as a chameleon-like 

instrumentalist, L’Rain doesn’t stay in one 
place for long. Despite Fatigue’s eclecticism, 
it never sounds disjointed. Instead, L’Rain has 
opened up a space for her emotions to breathe 
and interact with one another, reminding us 
that it’s okay to step back and reconcile the 
conflicting forces of our being. — Nora Lewis, 
Daily Arts Writer

Black Metal 2 – Dean Blunt

You remember laying in the backseat of your 

parents’ car — the one they got rid of years ago — 
and the radio is playing a hundred seats up; you’re 
looking at the yellow dots of street lights passing 
above you like paint strokes against a fogged-up 
mirror … ok, maybe it’s not like that. Maybe, it’s 
just another incredible edition to Dean Blunt’s 
discography of blissful, impossibly hypnotic 
and cruelly melancholic art-pop music: Black 
Metal 2. The British musician’s signature sound 
echoes throughout the 23-minute mini-album: 

his muddy baritone against the harmonization 
of album companion Joanne Robertson and 
her hazy vocals, along with lazy soulful guitars, 
warm string sections and production that rings 
snares and bells throughout such playfully short 
songs. Black Metal 2, the sequel to Dean Blunt’s 
2014 enigmatic Black Metal, feels less like a 
complete work and more like a continuation of 
a sound that is so confidently strong after the 
musician’s long and influential career. “DASH 
SNOW” has been on repeat since the album 
came out back in July, and no matter how much 
I listen to Dean Blunt, I somehow always find 
myself back to these songs, closing my eyes 
and swaying every inch of my body. Because 
that’s what his music does to you: It makes your 
everything sway. His music and lyrics have 
the effect of knowing something you wish you 
didn’t, but here you are, and what else can you 
do, you can’t get away; you can only sit down and 
listen to Black Metal 2 by Dean Blunt again and 
again. — Conor Durkin, Daily Arts Writer

Jubilee – Japanese Breakfast

Japanese Breakfast’s latest release, Jubilee, 

was by all means the perfect summer album. 
Though Michelle Zauner is best known for 
her heart-wrenching ballads and artistic 
performances, this 2021 album strays from 
somber narratives and embraces optimism 
successfully. Jubilee is the type of alternative 
pop album that can be blasted in the car 
equally as well as it can be background music 
while you’re doing homework. 

Mainstream queer television has certainly 

come a long way in the past several decades. 
Before revolutionary shows like “The L 
Word” or “Orange Is the New Black,” the 
most the LGBTQ+ community could expect 
of representation was an offhand reference 
to a minor queer character (whose existence 
often served as a punchline) or the implicit 
representation provided by queerbaiting, 
wherein media implies non-heterosexual 
relationships or attraction to engage an 
LGBTQ+ audience. Slowly but surely, popular 
television has grown more inclusive in terms 
of its queer representation, which has led to 
the creation of shows like Netflix’s “Q-Force,” 
one of the loudest forms of queer media 
television has produced to date. 

“Q-Force” 
centers 
around 
Steve 

Maryweather (Sean Hayes, “Will & Grace”), 
a gay secret agent who graduates at the top 
of his class from the American Intelligence 
Agency but is denied cases, promotions and 
his deserved title of valedictorian because 
of his LGBTQ+ identity. “Q-Force” is loud 
and explicit about representing queer 
culture, unlike the implicit nature of queer 
representation in the past. However, its 
representation is still limited to mainstream 
perceptions of queerness. 

Undoubtedly an ode to popular LGBTQ+ 

culture, the show features many often-
publicized aspects of the LGBTQ+ community, 
ranging from drag shows to “iconic” and “slay 
queen” diction to lesbians loving Subarus. One 
of the agents’ names is literally “Twink.”

When does a love letter become a mockery? 

It’s tough to draw the line between riffing on 
inside jokes from within the community and 
making the community into a punchline 
through exhausted stereotypes. As nearly 
every joke in the series centers around queer 
stereotypes, it begins to feel difficult to 
appreciate the humor rather than cringe away 

from it.

A commonly understood theme of comedy 

is the notion of punching up versus punching 
down. The comedian ought to aim upward 
at the most powerful instead of downward 
at those without a voice. The question arises 
whether “Q-Force” punches up or down, as 
well as whether all representation is good 
representation. What exactly qualifies as 
progressive representation?

On one hand, Gabe Liedman (“Brooklyn 

Nine-Nine”), the creator of “Q-Force,” is a 
gay man himself; thus, the content of the 
show seems more authentic than it would 
have had it been created from a heterosexual 
perspective. Also, the show’s central plot 
is centered around combating the power 
hierarchy of a system that discriminates 
against members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Despite its reliance on queer stereotypes, 

“Q-Force” is a show unlikely to have been 
created a decade ago and would have been 
unthinkable in the decades before that. The 
fact that a show like “Q-Force” is even possible 
is a testament to the progress made by the 
LGBTQ+ community.

The next question we have to answer: 

Given the community’s growing influence 
on popular culture, will the perception of 
the queer community be pigeonholed — 
becoming essentially a brand — or will queer 
representation develop into a more nuanced 
and human definition?

Ultimately, asking an animated comedy 

show to tackle the entirety of these questions 
is a lot, but it’s interesting to see where 
“Q-Force” fits within queer history. The series 
is unapologetic and provides an opportunity 
to celebrate and gain insight into a rich and 
historic culture. You just have to remember 
this form of representation can be one-
dimensional, and queerness isn’t limited to 
the series’ depiction.

Regardless, it’s always nice to see LGBTQ+ 

culture and relationships on screen, and 
“Q-Force” is an excellent reminder of how far 
LGBTQ+ representation has come.

‘Q-Force’ is in your face, for

SARAH RAHMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Colors and shapes: That’s all it takes to 

keep a kid occupied. Throw some auditory 
stimuli into the mix, and you’ve got a self-
sufficient machine equipped to monopolize 
a child’s neurons for hours. In a way, that’s 
exactly how I view the microcosm of video 
game streamers, in all their microphone-
screaming grandeur. It’s not for me, and 
that’s okay; the populace of overzealous 
20-somethings is instead embraced by an 
equally zealous audience of children. Therein 
lies the foreboding problem.

During a June 9 stream, Twitch streamer 

Adin Ross accidentally opened a Discord 
exchange in which a $2 million payment to 
Ross was discussed. Ross, whose connections 
to famous rappers turned the floodlights of 
popularity toward his channel, had at the 
time been streaming gambling games in 
crypto casinos, one of which being Duelbits.

Duelbits, alongside several sites of the 

same nature, is based offshore on the island of 
Curaçao where the regulations on gambling 
licenses are lax. Applicants are required 
to pay a fee, but background checks are 
negligent — previously approved web casinos 
have been fronts for money laundering and 
organized crime. Sites like Duelbits are not 
subject to legal disputes with customers or 
any general regulatory measures. There’s 
nothing withholding Duelbits from flagging 
users and confiscating their winnings at will 
or rigging their random-number generators 
to overturn the odds to the house.

The U.S. government cracks down on 

sites like Duelbits, effectively banning their 
service, but a powerful enough VPN can 
grant access to American players and prevent 
them from being tracked. Cryptocurrency 
adds another layer of protection — Duelbits 
accepts Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and 
Dogecoin, eliminating banks and credit card 
companies as third parties. Users might be 
traced by their cryptocurrency wallets, but 
the blockchain network ultimately offers 
unprecedented anonymity and control over 
one’s funds. 

In the case of Ross, what’s happening is 

quite simple: He hops on live, tacks a promo 
code to his stream, spends a few hours 
betting on Duelbits’ offerings of virtual slot 
machines, blackjack or roulette and gets rich. 
Sometimes he loses money, but that means it’s 
all the more exciting when he wins big. Either 
way, Ross is paid six to seven figures a month 
to gamble, so what difference does it make?

On YouTube, some of his best moments 

are clipped and re-uploaded. The titles of 
these videos give away the high-stakes 
nature of Ross’s streams: “ADIN ROSS WINS 
$300,000 GAMBLING IN MEXICO,” “ADIN 
ROSS LOSES $100K IN 10 MINUTES!! 
(HILARIOUS).” Ross loses money, but he 
wins more frequently — at least, the videos 
of him winning surpass those of him losing, 
both in quantity and in view count.

Even without YouTube views, Ross is 

popular with almost 5 million followers and 
34 million total views on Twitch. It takes little 
imagination to think of what kinds of people 
are watching Ross endorse casino games. The 
issue is that 37.9% of Twitch’s active users 
are between the ages 10 and 19. The math 
favors a fanbase of a whole lot of minors who 
aren’t equipped with the foresight needed 
to renounce the act of gambling, especially 
when their favorite streamer is adamant 
about its greatness. 

In an archived Twitch stream of the 

H3 Podcast, YouTuber Ethan Klein hosts 
Ross alongside streamers Hasan Piker and 
Matthew Rinaudo, and the four hash out over 
a Zoom call. Rinaudo, known on the site as 
Mizkif, was also briefly involved in gambling 
on Twitch. Most of the conversation takes 
place between Klein and Ross, as the focus 
of the episode is the gambling controversy. 
When Ross is confronted with accusations 
that he’s doing something objectively wrong, 
he doesn’t hesitate to agree.

Klein inquires, “ 
You have no problem 

peddling gambling to children, that’s a more 
soulless act than not smiling, wouldn’t you 
agree?”

Ross breaks into a cheeky grin before 

responding, “It’s fun!”

It’s easy to understand how Ross gets so 

caught up in the scheme. The live events 
are so emotionally charged that it feels like 
intruding — imagine a Las Vegas casino, 
but with a camera propped up at every 
machine. In one video, Ross leans forward in 
concentration, eyes locked on the whirring 
images of shiny multicolored gems. He shouts 
expletives at the game as if to intimidate it into 
improving his odds. When he scores, he grins 
widely. When he scores big, he claps, shouts 
and jumps in his seat, as zaps of adrenaline 
take a physical form. This is what the kids 
are interested in — the thrilling nature of the 
game, the scintillating stunt of victory.

Age is the fundamental issue — in every 

sense, promoting gambling to children is 
deeply, unequivocally wrong. To watch 
someone experience unprecedented peaks 
of euphoria upon winning a life-changing 
amount of money is extremely dangerous 
to the impressionable; these are moments 
that should not be broadcasted, that no child 
should ever see.

There’s a reason why the federal 

government age-restricts gambling. Children 
and adolescents are more likely to gamble 
for entertainment, to compete with their 
friends or to relieve boredom, as opposed 
to adults who are more motivated by the 
advantage of a financial boost. The effects 
of gambling are thus exacerbated on young 
brains — substance abuse, interpersonal 
difficulties and a host of mental health 
problems can result. A lack of research clouds 
our understanding of treatment options, but 
if an Adin Ross fan falls victim to the grave 
reality of a gambling problem, Ross will hold 
on tighter to his earnings, with all but an 
impertinent smirk to offer in return.

As for Ross, he is not trying to run from 

being canceled, or to avoid some scandal; 
he accepts the allegations in a way that 
almost feels unexpected. He knows what 
he’s doing, and he knows that it’s wrong. If 
the circumstances were different, it would 
almost be unfair to expect a 20-year-old to 
be a knight of virtue and turn down a life-
changing sum of money.

I’m 19 years old, and I just started making 

my own doctor’s appointments — and I mean 
just started. Independence is a looming 
shadow under the water, an unflinching fact 
of life that I will soon have to embrace. This 
is the age for opening a checking account and 
finding a cheap apartment, not deciding how 
to spend millions of dollars in excess cash. In 
fact, I spend almost every conscious minute 
distracting myself from existential confusion 
and thoughts about my future — it’s hard to 
speak for Ross because he is so alienated from 
the triviality of the college-aged person. If he 
wasn’t sitting proudly in moral purgatory, I 
might feel bad for Ross; maybe somewhere 
in there is a deeply misguided kid, blinded by 
millionaire tunnel vision. 

The nature of digital celebrities brings 

about a new kind of autonomy for young stars, 
because the internet is not an industry in the 
way Hollywood is. There are less talent scouts 
and big studio contracts — instead, as the 
product, the internet celebrity governs the 
way they carry themself in the virtual realm 
with minimal guidance. 

Ross accepted the money because he’s the 

guy in charge, even though this choice may 
bear detriment to his future as a successful 
figure. He might not be mainstream enough 
to attract the likes of tabloid journalism, but 
he is important enough to influence a large 
niche audience. Ross, at the age of 20, is 
granted this formidable power and platform, 
and he uses it to peddle the most harmful 
habit next to drugs. 

While Ross is entitled to his own poor 

judgment, Twitch is entitled to operating 
a safe, accessible platform. To answer the 
question of “who let this happen,” we must 
fixate the accusatory glare on the site itself. 
Ross, accompanied by several others like him, 
operates under the rules of the website — rules 
that have failed to condemn online gambling 
as a whole. Twitch’s terms of service impose a 
blanket policy prohibiting illegal activity, but 
restrictions against gambling streams are not 
specifically written.

What we see on Twitch is streamable, and 

anything streamable is monetized. While 
there’s still a chance to set a precedent and 
wholly condemn online gambling, Twitch 
willfully neglects the issue; their inaction 
serves to convince more streamers that it’s 
okay to Adin Ross-ify their content.

There should be a serious incentive 

to act the opposite, but the website’s 
accommodation of gambling implies a grim 
future of Twitch as a destination for brand 
advertising and unscrupulous money-grabs, 
a platform on which ethics are thrown out 
the window.

Adin Ross sets bad precedents with Twitch gambling

26 “Morning Edition” 

Every year around this time, the stares 

intensify. It doesn’t matter that I was born 
here or that I’ve lived here my entire life. The 
sense of estrangement in the country that I 
am a citizen of is as severe as ever.

It’s been 20 years. 
I am only 19. 
So why am I regarded as a monster?
How can I bear responsibility for 

something I wasn’t even alive to witness?

Why am I expected to apologize for the 

actions of those I have no connection to?

Is it because I am Muslim?
Is it because I wear the hijab?
Is it because I speak Arabic?
What about my identity makes it so easy 

for America to pin its grief on me?

Anti-Muslim profiling and surveillance 

of 
communities. 
Unlawful 
detentions. 

Racist immigration policies and bans that 
tore families apart. Endless wars waged in 
the name of fighting terror. Hundreds of 
thousands of children, mothers and fathers 
murdered in cold blood. Millions more 
displaced. 
Afghanistan, 
Iraq, 
Pakistan, 

Yemen. All scapegoats for securing America’s 
world dominance, ensuring this country 
remains number one at all costs. 

As we step out of our apartment, my 

roommate and I laugh about random TSA 
checks we’ve endured and the potential of 
being hate crimed. But this feeling is anything 
but funny. This is the life of many other 
Muslims living in Westernized societies 
around the world. 

Especially those of us who wear hijabs. 
Especially those of us with obvious 

Muslim names.

Especially those of us forced to directly 

witness American imperialism unfold under 
the visage of fighting terrorists.

Lives altered forever. Intergenerational 

trauma 
lingering, 
waiting 
to 
explode 

like bombs suspended in the air. People 
abandoning their identity and livelihoods 
out of fear. Triple checking anything and 
everything they say or do. Because God forbid 
you make a mistake. God forbid you mess up. 

***

As my Muslim parents taught me about 

the beauty of Islam and the love and empathy 
it preaches, the military family next door fed 
their children propganda about my religion, 
filling their hearts and minds with hatred 
towards all Muslims. 

When Dylan and Lauren would come 

out to play, my brother and I would hide 
around the porch, waiting in anticipation as 
they rushed into our backyard to indulge in 

kickball with hushed voices. If their parents 
ever peeked out the window and found they 
were out of sight — possibly spending time 
with two young Muslim children — they 
called them back inside immediately and 
would keep them there until my brother 
and I went back home. Then, and only then 
were Dylan and Lauren allowed back outside. 
This tiringly endless cycle continued on, but 
the measly half hour of fun with them was 
worth it. One week, they stopped coming out 
to play. We were only informed by the fading 
chalk note they left on the sidewalk that they 
had moved out because Dylan and Lauren 
weren’t allowed to say goodbye.

My brother Ali was 5. I was 6.

***

Ramadan rolled around during the school 

year. I had fasted for the first time the year 
before, but only a few scattered days, so I was 
committed to fasting the full month this time. 
My parents were worried I would get hungry 
and dehydrated at school. Not wanting to 
discourage me, they told me it would be easier 
to fast on the weekends and that I would be 
rewarded with goodies and prizes, but after 
a long night of begging and pleading, they 
reluctantly agreed. As my mom dropped 
me and my brothers off to school the next 
morning, she reminded me it would be okay 
to just fast until lunchtime and then she 
bid me farewell. But I was too excited and 
determined to prove my strength. When 
lunchtime rolled around, the kids in the 
cafeteria bombarded me with questions, 
noting that I didn’t grab a lunch tray or take 
out my lunchbox. I protested giving them an 
explanation, and finally they came to their 
own prejudiced conclusion: that my parents 
were neglectful and forced me not to eat. 
They said I should be adopted by new parents 
that would love and feed me. My classmates 
continued discussing my family situation 
— as if I wasn’t there — as my brother’s 
kindergarten teacher started rounding his 
class up for recess. He saw me and ran up for a 
hug. Now that everyone knew I had a sibling, 
the conversation grew deeper. One girl, who 
was adopted, declared it would be hard to 
find a family willing to take in two kids, and 
that we probably wouldn’t stay together.

My brother Ahmed was 6. I was 10.

We were in line to board the plane on our 

way to Jordan. My brothers and I were so 
excited that we didn’t get a lick of sleep the 
night before. As per usual, my dad had us at 
the airport 6 hours before departure “just 
in case.” It was a good thing he did. After 
completing the customary security checks, 
we were all pulled aside for a “random” TSA 
check. We were heavily interrogated before 
even setting our bags down, and my youngest 

brother was starting to get antsy. I reached 
over to my bag to grab the stuffed animal I 
had been carrying for him. Immediately, the 
TSA agent told me to stop what I was doing 
and grabbed his walkie talkie to call for 
backup. We were the first ones to check in, 
but the last ones to board the flight.

My brother Amin was 5. I was 14.

Terrorist. Towel head. Camel jockey. Goat 

f***er. Sand n***er. 

The anti-Muslim slurs and hate go on for 

decades. 

Then, there is also this aggression towards 

the religion of Islam as a whole that stems 
from preconceived notions of associating 
Muslim women who cover themselves with 
oppression and this belief that western 
women must provide them with secular 
liberation. This idea of “colonial feminism” 
falsely labels the hijab or veil as a sign of 
oppression, but gives no support to things like 
women’s right to education or suffrage. It is 
used to justify past colonization of and current 
war in the Middle East, all done under the 
guise of fighting for the rights and dignities 
of Muslim women. Rather than focus on the 
actual safety and health of women in the 
Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, the 
United States and Europe use “the freedom to 
unveil” as a tactic for waging wars, colonizing 

lands,and extracting valuable resources. 
The obsession with this unveiling of Muslim 
women connects back to the savior complex 
of the West and their Orientalist view of the 
East; white men saving brown women from 
brown men. These white men have no actual 
concern for “saving” brown women, they are 
more so ridding the brown man of all that is 
“his” while simultaneously pinning him as 
the danger. Essentially, either way women are 
not concerned for, but painting their freedom 
as the motivation provides access and acclaim 
to the white man without him having to do 
anything other than harm the brown man. 
This othering of the East allows the West to 
justify the wars they wage while granting 
them impunity, aiding them in furthering their 
own personal gain and economic agendas.

With this piece, I do not intend to center 

my plight or dissect Orientalism while 
discrediting the pain of those who lost loved 
ones on 9/11. I do, however, want to bring light 
to an oftentimes forgotten group. A group 
that is facing the violent and blatantly hateful 
consequences of a day and event they had 
nothing to do with. A group that is constantly 
expected to condemn and apologize for 
the actions of others they don’t know, 
but of whom they have become assumed 
accomplices. A double standard that their 
white, Christain counterparts are not held to. 

An emotionally draining barrage of questions 
that will always have us on the defensive: 
“Does your religion promote terrorism? 
Doesn’t jihad mean killing all non-Muslims? 
Why do you guys hate America so much?”

We don’t hate America so much. We hate 

America’s foriegn policy that advocates for 
the destruction of the countries we belong 
to. We hate that the American government 
engages in imperialism abroad. We hate 
that America feels so entitled to our natural 
resources to the point where forever wars 
have become the norm. But I don’t hate 
America as a whole nor am I rooting for its 
destruction. My parents came to America to 
pursue their own higher education and give 
me and my brothers the chance at a better life. 
Opportunities. Freedom. A fighting chance 
to live a life free of war and destruction. But 
this war and destruction that my family was 
forced to flee didn’t just “come to be.” It’s part 
of an endless cycle of colonial imperialism. 
White supremacy. Orientalism. A cycle filled 
with intergenerational trauma and pain. 
One that America is at the forefront of. But 
I am still an American citizen. And though 
this country is far from perfect, it is still my 
country.

The afternoon sky seems to bleed 

forever as the highway traffic drives 
closer into its abyss. Cars race past 
me: 20 over the limit, determined to 
get to where they’re going. I take a 
sip of water, and I let my left hand 
slide 
down 
the 
steering 
wheel. 

Drinking more water seems like 
the right thing to do. I drink more 
water. Listen to more podcasts. I’m 
not really listening though. I switch 
between catastrophic daily news, 
philosophical food for thought and 
niche playlists made by my best 
friend from high school. Anything to 
keep me from forming a thought of 
my own. 

Commuting in silence felt like a 

waste of time. 

More accurately, spending time 

with myself felt like a waste of time. 

I had been back and forth all 

summer. 

Between my hometown and my 

college town. 

Between the home I grew out of 

and the home I grew into. 

On the road again before the end 

of the week. 

Just me and my little red Nissan. 
I was unreachable. 
I was a nomad. 
I used to be envious of the 

vagabond. 
Detached 
from 

Destination, they were free to roam. 
How liberating that must feel. But 
I don’t feel like that. I feel trapped. 
Trapped by repetitive days. Trapped 
by my own company.

I was never really good at spending 

time with myself. 

My summer commute left me with 

no choice.

- Packing List: 
- Work Uniform
- Extra Gym Clothes
- Laptop
- Follow through on plans with 

college friend

- Grab groceries before I get to my 

place

Shit. I forgot my vitamins again. 

I merge onto the M-14 highway. 

I run through lists in my head and 

forgive my forgetfulness. Co-Star 
told me to be kind to myself today. It’s 
good to believe in something. Even if 
it’s some shitty astrology app. I queue 
up Lorde’s “Mood Ring” just for the 
irony. I was desperately chasing after 
some kind of eudaimonic well being, 
hoping it would be the antidote to my 
chronic Pure Heroine phase. 

Driving is one of those things I 

often crave when I need to think or be 
alone. When I need to escape reality. 
When I’m not focused on where I’m 
headed. But these days, I wish I could 
reach the Destination faster.

These days, this commute feels like 

a very painful purgatory between 
places 
of 
belonging. 
Between 

versions of myself. 

The human condition frequently 

centers around being rather than 
becoming. A podcast I’ve grown 
to like speaks of this in the most 
metaphysical sense — in the way 
that nothing is static and everything 
is constantly changing at the most 
elemental level. But on those drives 
when the stereo can no longer pacify 
my demanding thoughts, I’m focused 
on everything I am not — everything 
I am not being and everything I am 
not becoming. I know that’s not fair 
to myself, and I resent my hostility. 
Soon enough, Interstate 275 blurs 
from my vision and the month’s 
repressed tears spill over. 

Driving in a storm activates my 

fight or flight. 

This time, though, I choose to 

fight.

I choose to soften my bitterness. 

Partly because it’s an exhausting 
emotion. Partly because I deserve 
better. I switch on my wipers, forging 
ahead. And when the rain subsides, I 
discover sparse roots of healing. The 
very crooked healing that makes you 
weary. Weary and impatient. 

With every red light and detour, 

my impatience intensifies. But I can 
only think of moving forward. 

I am becoming. My being is always 

becoming. 

This is me believing in something 

more. I may not be There yet, but I’m 
on my way.

June, July and August slip away in 

monotonous movements. And maybe 
somewhere along the way, I made 
peace with this two-laned concrete 
journey of mine.

My summer commute

EASHETA SHAH

MiC Columnist


Last Saturday at the Big House, I saw 

a sea of Maize-and-Blue — as it is often 
described whenever we convene at the 
stadium — complete with bodies packed 
and bleachers stacked in undulating 
exaltation. Hours later, a similar sea 
moving in a much faster fashion rushed 
ashore on the surface of my phone as one 
by one, post after post flooded my feed all 
in service to gameday.

But let’s be clear. Gameday photos are 

never a monolith. They exist in multitudes. 
There’s the tailgate pic at the pregame, the 
pic in front of the stadium, the pic inside 
the stadium whilst standing in the crowd, 
the stadium selfie, and the enduring 
pic exemplifying the view of the vast 
amalgamation of fans, players, stadium 
decorations, 
lights 
and 
iconography. 

Nonetheless, the feed dries. The game day 
hype (temporarily) dies, but I know with 

great certainty the wave will return, not 
just offline, but online too. 

Aquatic allegories aside, it’s no secret 

that social media and our use of it play 
serious roles in our lives. Many of us 
now recognize it as having a pathological 
character 
to 
it, 
as 
exemplified 
in 

documentaries like “The Social Dilemma” 
(2020) and psychological thrillers like 
“Black Mirror.” We can see a common 
critique of digital connection daily as we 
witness more and more the rejection of the 
online coupled with the glorification of the 
offline, leading us to demonize the former 
through our veneration of the latter. Yet 
this precipitous perspective, rooted in 
what social theorist Nathan Jurgenson 
describes in his book “The Social Photo: 
On Photography and Social Media” as 
digital dualism, creates a false separation 
of the online and offline world. This false 
separation fails to take into consideration 
the vastness and variety social media and 
online platforms offer to us as human 
beings and spiritual entities. Indeed, our 

preoccupation with social media suggests 
that there is something profound to be 
found in the digital mediation of our lives. 

Our soul’s desire for life in documented 

form manifests itself in a myriad of means. 
Journals, letters, diaries, scrapbooks 
and social media platforms all mediate 
our 
memory 
and 
lived 
experience 

into a materialized entity. French film 
critic André Bazin, in his text “The 
Ontology of the Photographic Image,” 
likens the documentation technology 
of photography to the embalming of 
the dead. In taking a photo, a formerly 
transient reality earns an eternal quality. 
The moment is not mourned. Instead, 
death is transgressed and the instance is 
immortalized. The past is preserved in the 
present, and what’s fleeting is now fodder 
for the future, forever. Photos freeze a 
place and time into eternity. Evidently, 
our souls crave to make that which is 
transient transcend time and space. 
Yet with our near-omniscient power of 
preservation, this documentary impulse is 

easily exploited, leaving us to ponder what 
is and what is not worth documenting. 
Jurgenson maintains that our everyday 
participation 
in 
social 
photography 

restructures our minds so that our life 
is “experienced in the service of its 
documentation.” With an audience always 
at our disposal, we see the world through 
the lens of others. This compulsion for 
documentation and the making of media 
has heavy implications for our memory. As 
José van Dijik, distinguished new media 
professor, discusses in her book “Mediated 

Memories in the Digital Age,” media and 
memory are not separate from each other, 
but constantly intertwining, as the former 
intensifies, contaminates and even usurps 
the latter. When what we remember from 
the past is primarily based on the curated 
collection of content created for the sake of 
others, we’re left to wonder what that does 
to our sense of self. 

As 
American 
sociologist 
Charles 

Horton Cooley’s theory of the looking-
glass self espouses, we have a tendency to 
base our sense of self on the perception of 
others. Critics of social media claim that its 
performative nature erodes the expression 
of our authentic selves. Success theater and 
status posturing, as Jurgenson describes 
it, do play a role in the cultivation of our 
Internet personas. Yet Jurgenson argues 
that these conflicts between the authentic 
and performative selves transcend social 
media. He believes the assumption that 
the performative self is based on non-truth 
often implies that the authentic self, or the 
act of being true to oneself, assumes there 
is truth in the self to begin with. 

Everyday life, with its persistent 

perception on behalf of others, ensures 
that the self is largely a performance. In 
this vein, it makes sense that social media 
is also performative fiction. Beyond our 
souls’ desire for documentation is the 
desire for performance as well. This does 
not necessarily mean performance in a 
theatrical sense, but much of the soul of 
social media can be found in its theatrics. 
We see evidence of this in the aesthetics 
cultivated in each application, the need 
for evoking imagery that is pleasing to 

the eye, as well as the employment of the 
body as a site for exhibition. As French 
literary theorist Roland Barthes states in 
his text “Camera Lucinda,” “Once I feel 
myself observed by the lens, everything 
changes: I constitute myself in the process 
of posing, I instantaneously make another 
body for myself, I transform in advance 
into an image.” The particularities of 
posing, the postures and the physicality 
involved in creating social media content 
convince me to believe that there is, 
indeed, a performing artist inside of each 

one of us, awaiting its opportunity to take 
the stage. 

Turning the lights up on this stage 

allows us to see that there’s always more 
than meets the eye in every social media 
photo, video or post. All content invites us 
into a world of imagination and mystery 
— hallmarks of the soul, according to 
Jungian psychotherapist Thomas Moore. 
Social media carries with it an infinity 
of imaginative elements. As French 
philosopher Georges Bataille believed, 
any accumulation of knowledge is also 
an accumulation of non-knowledge. A 
single post contains as much ignorance 
as it does insight, if not more. Jurgenson 
notes that there is an obscenity to our 
online personas in the desire to reveal and 
expose details of our everyday lives, but 
also a seduction in which we “strategically 
withhold knowledge to create magical and 
enchanted interests.” One photo, tweet 
or status update can raise a continuum of 
questions — who we’re with, what we’re 
doing, how we’re doing and where we 
are — all centered around the object of 
interest. We become intrigued and seek 
to intrigue others in the details of our day-
to-day lives. Anyone who has ever had a 
crush on somebody knows the feeling of 
going to the profile page of their newfound 
interests and marveling at the mystery 
inherent in the media. Our souls have 
strong desires for attachment to people, 
places and objects; social media allows 
us to preserve our attachments with very 
little effort.

Mars drives you to increase your

Second-guessing my future

I haven’t sat in a class like 

this in almost a year. One of 
my professors is talking in the 
front of the classroom about 
something — I’m listening to 
his voice but he’s talking too 
fast for me to follow. The lights 
in the room are dull but loud, 
nurturing a slight whining noise 
in my ears. 

I actually like this setting: 

the familiar musty smell of an 
old building, the act of sitting 
next to strangers and the faint 
noise of the fluorescents. Even 
though none of these things 
are enjoyable by themselves, I 
like it because it makes me feel 
normal, as if school is finally 
becoming what I expect and 
remember it to be. 

As much as I enjoy the 

normalcy of it all, I can’t help but 
feel a little uneasy spending all 
of my effort trying to understand 
what people are saying. We 
started syllabus week in some 
of my classes by going around 
and introducing ourselves: year, 
major, hobbies. Most people are 
sure of themselves — they’ve 
decided on what they will focus 
on, a decision that will tell them 
how to navigate the rest of their 
years here as well as help them 
make plans about their post-
university future.

I’m still a little confused, 

though. Not about college in 
general — I feel like I’ve been 
here long enough to be able 
to outline what is going on 
socially and academically — 
but about my future. Last year, 

when I entered the University 
as an undeclared freshman, 
my advisor encouraged me to 
think about what I wanted to 
do in the future and reflect on 
what I enjoyed in the present. I 
listened to her advice and even 
followed it, but I struggled to 
engage when I asked myself 
about my future and even my 
likes and dislikes. 

It seems a little pathetic to 

admit I hardly know what I 
enjoy and what I don’t. Do I 
like this because I am actually 
interested in it, or is it just easy? 
Is this actually easy or did they 
just grade easily? Am I actually 
good at this at all? What if I get 
to the higher levels and start to 
hate it? But do I even have to 
like it at all as long as it pays my 
bills?

I’m 
paying 
tuition 
and 

striving toward a degree, but so 
far I have no idea what I’d like 
that degree to say. I’ve always 
been indecisive — sometimes I 
close UberEats because I’m too 
overwhelmed by the number of 
choices I have — and a part of 
me feels like my time is starting 
to run out. I have to declare by 
the end of next semester, but I 
am as lost as I was in freshman 
year. 

My major and my future 

plans come up often at my 
family dinner table or during 
family FaceTimes. When I click 
on the group call notification, 
I prepare myself to hear the 
question: So did you decide what 
you’re going to do? I’ve never 
been able to form a concrete 
response to this; the questions 
of the future still seem so far 
even as they draw nearer. I am 

the type of person who takes 
things as they come, someone 
who doesn’t necessarily plan 
ahead. Even writing follows 
that process for me — I never 
know what my endpoint is, but 
my words figure themselves out 
along the way and everything 
eventually turns out to be 
passable. I am waiting for the 
pieces of my life to fit together 
in the way that these sentences 
do so that I can eventually reach 
some epiphany, some sort of 
push towards figuring out what 
I want for myself. “I’ll figure 
it out eventually,” has always 
been my motto, because things 
usually do align properly for 
me eventually. But the truth 
is that I want too many things 
and sometimes see too many 
possibilities, obfuscating the 
goals 
that 
I 
am 
searching 

for 
until 
I 
am 
completely 

overwhelmed by them. 

It’s not just the possibilities 

that are so unnerving to me, but 
also the uncertainties that they 
all carry. I wish I could watch all 
of my possible futures and then 
choose which one suits me best, 
like reading the walkthrough 
for a video game. Should I 
follow my love of writing? 
Biology? Academia? I can’t ask 
Google what choices I should 
make to create the best ending 
of my life. We’re all oblivious 
to the future, but sometimes I 
feel like I’m unaware of my own 
thoughts. 

Worrying 
about 
the 

future 
and 
its 
ambiguities 

obviously won’t go away once 
I decide what I want to pursue 
academically. 
My 
indecision 

won’t, either. And yet, that task 

of narrowing things down feels 
so integral to my ideas of the 

future. I know, technically, that 
I can always change my mind 
and that I can choose so many 
different things for myself after 
my years here are over. I know 
that I’m still young and that I 
have time to explore the world, 
myself and my interests. But the 
things that I know to be true 
can’t change the way that I feel 
right now. My logic is betraying 
me. In the long run, time isn’t 
running out but in the present, 
time is slipping away. Though I 
have a whole life ahead of me, I 
only have two years of college 
left. I can’t exactly imagine a 

life outside of the structure of 
academia, so it feels like there 

are only two years left to figure 
my life out. 

My anxiety about timing 

should push me to try to 
discover what I want from 
myself, but every time I look 
inward I get stuck in the same 
positive 
feedback 
loop 
of 

knowing I need to think about 
my options, worrying about the 
consequences of making the 
wrong choice and then shutting 
down out of sheer worry and 
frustration. I’ll enter my normal 
and 
easy-going 
state 
until 

something flips the switch on 
the anxiety again: a question 

from one of my family members, 
my friends talking about their 

research, mentions of LinkedIn 
connections. I feel so utterly 
behind from the rest of my 
peers mostly because many of 
them seem to have everything 
planned out. 

I’m told by my family that I 

need to take a more active role 
and start to push outwards 
instead of reflecting inwards 
towards myself, which is what 
I usually do when I’m confused. 
But even that leaves me at a loss. 
Push out towards what exactly? 
If I knew, I wonder if I would 
second-guess myself out of the 
answer.

7-Opinion

O

ne year ago, our campus 
felt 
chaotic. 
Inadequate 

testing, spiking COVID-19 

cases and thousands of frightened 
and disgruntled university workers, 
who, in a shock to the system, 
declared they were going on strike for 
better working conditions. 

Among 
these 
workers 
were 

more than a hundred members of 
University 
Housing’s 
Residential 

Staff who joined the strike to pursue 
their own demands, in a two-week-
long struggle that University Housing 
refers to as a “work stoppage.” With 
the Lecturers’ Union on track to go 
on strike this month, unmet labor 
demands could once again deeply 
impact student life on campus. 

Why are so many labor demands 

not met at our university? To 
understand this, we should first 
understand what happened with 
the largest undergraduate workers’ 
strike in the University of Michigan’s 
history, the 2020 ResStaff strike.

Without 
a 
union, 
these 

undergraduate student employees 
supported the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization 
in 
their 
strike, 

organized in opposition to the 
University’s fall 2020 reopening 
plans. After initial requests were not 
met, and insufficient answers were 
provided in a ResStaff Town Hall, the 
strike commenced. 

In a move that attracted the 

attention of national news outlets, 
the resident advisers held out for two 
weeks before accepting an offer by 
U-M administration and returning to 
work on Sept. 22, 2020.

One factor that explains the 

hardiness of the ResStaff strike 
was the overwhelming support on 
campus. LSA Student Government 
released a statement in support of the 
ResStaff strike after a vote of 26-0. 
One petition written in support of 
ResStaff received more than 2,000 
signatures before the strike’s end. 
GEO organized a solidarity rally with 
MDining workers and ResStaff. An 
open letter circulated among non-
tenured U-M staff garnered nearly 
200 signatures. Though support 
was not universal, it is certain that 
the ResStaff strike sent ripples 
throughout Ann Arbor and beyond.

***
Looking back on this “stoppage,” 

we are left to consider: What has 
changed? Was it a success? Are 
conditions now better for RAs and 
other members of ResStaff? 

One must look no further than 

at the strikers’ original demands to 
evaluate the impact:

First: 
“Regular 
access 
to 

testing for all of ResStaff (not only 
symptomatic 
individuals).” 
The 

University achieved this early on, 
offering as-needed testing for all 
members of the campus community, 
and mandating weekly testing for 
residence hall residents (including 
RAs) in the Winter 2021 semester. 
With the campus vaccine mandate 

now in effect, weekly testing is no 
longer mandated by the University 
except for students and faculty who 
have not yet received the vaccine or 
who are exempted.

Second: 
“Providing 
sufficient, 

effective PPE to ResStaff and 
Students.” Housing provided masks 
and gloves for ResStaff to use when 
working in community spaces, as 
well as plastic face barriers. Students 
were not extended this same degree 
of personal protective equipment, 
though they (and ResStaff) were 
issued reusable cotton masks as well 
as U-M-branded bandanas during 
their move-in.

Third: “Enforcement of social 

distancing and face coverings inside 
and outside of residence halls and 
dining halls” and “enforcement of 
currently unenforceable guest policy 
by non-student employees.” Though 
this policy was in place on paper, 
there were many reported cases of 
lax enforcement of U-M policies. The 
onus was placed on RAs to enforce 
these policies during their work 
inside residence halls; dining hall 
staff did likewise at their workplaces. 
It’s unclear whether this demand 
was ever fully met to the extent that 
the strikers desired. As part of this 
demand, RAs desired more stringent 
consequences for policy breakers. 
Whether it was due to this change 
or not, there were certainly students 
whose 
housing 
contracts 
were 

terminated as a result of COVID-19-
related violations.

Fourth: “Hiring and staffing to 

normal capacity for all facilities and 
housing teams.” This demand is 
harder to pin down, however, given 
the fact that University Housing’s 
website has job postings for both 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 

communities. It’s likely still the case 
that the residence halls are not fully 
staffed at the moment. 

Fifth: 
“More 
specific 
public 

and ResStaff communication and 
transparency.” University Housing 
reinstated their policy of providing 
daily updates to ResStaff members 
via email; the U-M COVID-19 
dashboard also began breaking down 
case statistics by building and floor. 
However, ResStaff members were 
quick to point out inaccuracies that 
seemed to appear in the dashboard 
data.

Sixth: “Hazard pay for ResStaff.” 

Most members of ResStaff are not 
compensated outside of their room 
and board expenses. ResStaff was 
not provided with hazard pay in any 

form; a stipend of $200 in Blue Bucks 
was provided to ResStaff, to be used 
at 
University-owned 
restaurants 

and stores. This one-time payment 
of “Rick Bucks” (so dubbed after the 
Director of Housing, Rick Gibson) did 
not fully meet the strikers’ demands 
for compensation in recognition of 
the unique threats of the pandemic.

And lastly: “A formal statement 

of no retaliation from Housing 
Administration should a ResStaff 
Union be formed” and “a formal 
statement of no retaliation from 
Housing 
Administration 
or 

University Administration against 
any ResStaff member who went on 
strike, is currently on strike, or is 
supporting the strike.” For many on 
ResStaff, this point was especially 
controversial, as ResStaff members 
allege 
that 
Gibson 
implicitly 

threatened to fire ResStaff members 
in a closed-door meeting. Regarding 
a ResStaff union, the University 
explicitly declined to make any 
agreements regarding any sort of 
future bargaining unit.

***
Most of the demands were met, 

in one way or another, by University 
Housing. Others will eventually be 
deemed moot after the end of the 
pandemic. This does not include, 
however, the two most important 
long-term demands: hazard pay and 
the tacit permission that a ResStaff 
union may be formed. 

It comes as no surprise that the 

University would want to prevent the 

formal unionization of ResStaff, given 
the successes that have been achieved 
by the RAs already, as well as those 
achieved by actual unions in the form 
of GEO and LEO in recent years.

The tactics used by the University 

to defuse the strike are not new. In the 
case of the ResStaff strike, the same 
tactics can continue to be employed. 

Most RAs work for a maximum 

of three years before they graduate. 
When they put forth their demands, 
all the administration needs to do is 
wait them out. They will graduate 
and be replaced by students who don’t 
have the knowledge or confidence to 
make the same demands. By the time 
these students become empowered to 
advocate for themselves, it is often too 
late, and the cycle repeats. 

It’s with this framework in mind 

that we look toward an uncertain 
future. Time will only tell what will 
become of the ResStaff’s unmet 
demands and whether they emerge 
as an exception or an embodiment of 
this cycle.

W

omen’s 
reproductive 

rights 
are 
under 

assault in Texas. The 

passage of a new anti-abortion law 
by the conservative state legislature 
and the complicity of the Supreme 
Court has endangered the freedom 
and safety of women across Texas 
and the entire nation. 

At midnight on Sept. 1, 2021, a 

new anti-abortion law went into 
effect in Texas. This law prohibits 
women from obtaining an abortion 
if a fetal heartbeat is detected. 
Fetal heartbeats can be detected 
as early as six weeks, before many 
women know they are pregnant. 
Therefore, this new law all but 
ensures that countless women in 
Texas will not have access to safe 
abortion services. This law is so 
restrictive that it does not even 
have exceptions for cases of rape or 
incest.

The 
Texas 
law 
is 
unique 

compared to other “heartbeat 
bills” in that it does not set criminal 
penalties for violating the ban. 
Instead, the law allows private 
citizens to sue anyone who helps 
women receive an abortion if a fetal 
heartbeat is present.

This 
means 
that 
private 

citizens with no relationship to 
the patient can sue anyone who is 
even tangentially connected to the 
patient. Therefore, everyone from 
a doctor, to a partner, to the Uber 
driver who drove the woman to the 
clinic could be sued if the abortion 
was performed with a heartbeat 
present. 

The law reads like a scene 

from Margaret Atwood’s “The 
Handmaid’s 
Tale,” 
with 
the 

government exerting control over 

women’s reproductive health and 
encouraging people to spy on each 
other and report to the authorities. 
Anti-abortion groups in Texas 
have already set up whistleblower 
sites to encourage people to turn in 
clinics and individuals they believe 
are violating the new law.

Opponents of the bill have 

warned that anti-abortion groups 
will use this law as a pretext to 
continuously sue clinics, causing 
major financial and legal hardship 
to clinics that provide a wide range 
of health services beyond abortion 
services. 

In the case of other so-called 

“heartbeat laws,” the United States 
Supreme Court has prevented 
the laws from going into effect. 
The court had continually used 
the precedent set in the landmark 
Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court 
decision, which established the 
constitutional right to obtain an 
abortion. However, after a day of 
silence, the Supreme Court ruled 
late at night on Sept. 1 that the Texas 
abortion ban can be implemented 
while challenges to the law work 
their way through the federal court 
system. 

The shocking 5-4 decision, 

with most conservative justices 
ruling in favor of the abortion ban, 
effectively gutted the constitutional 
protections of Roe vs. Wade in 
Texas. 

This ruling of the court will 

have major repercussions beyond 
Texas. Other conservative states 
have signaled that they will try to 
pass similar legislation. Even if the 
Supreme Court eventually strikes 
down this law, the precedent 
set in Wednesday night’s ruling 
sends a message that this highly 
conservative court does not intend 
to protect reproductive rights. 

The impact that this bill will have 

on women in Texas and beyond is 
truly dire. At only six weeks, many 
women will not know they are 
pregnant and will therefore miss 
their window to receive the care 
they need. 

This bill is especially callous 

because it will harm lower-income 
women at a much higher rate. For 
women in Texas, the only way to 
receive care after six weeks is to 
travel out of state, but for many 
women, this is an unattainable 
solution. Traveling out of state to 
receive reproductive health care 
is not possible for many women. 
The cost of traveling out of state, 
time required to take off of work 
or other commitments are factors 
that disproportionately bar lower-
income women from accessing 
safe abortions. On the other hand, 
those who have wealth can access 
abortions with relative ease.

The women who cannot afford 

to go out of state to receive care may 
turn to unsafe measures instead. 
We have seen in the past that when 
abortion is not legal, women will 
utilize unsafe methods to terminate 
their pregnancy, which can result 
in severe injury or death.

Even women who do receive 

care before a heartbeat is detected 
will likely be plagued with fear that 
someone could find out about their 
procedure and attempt to initiate a 
lawsuit against people in their lives, 
or even those barely related, such 
as the aforementioned ride-share 
driver. 

The ruling by the Supreme Court 

has made women across the United 
States less free and sent a message 
that women cannot have autonomy 
over their bodies and their health 
care decisions. It is up to all of us to 
speak in opposition to this ruling 
and use our voice and our vote to 
protect reproductive rights. 

I

magine 
a 
technological 

innovation that can weed out 
child predators hiding in the dark 

pockets of the internet — a beautiful, 
life-saving move that prioritizes safety 
and protection and one the architect 
should be celebrated for. 

Now 
imagine 
opposition, 

resistance and dissent toward 
that tool — specifically, rooted in 
fears of technological abuse and 
contaminated privacy. 

Apple has been facing criticism 

recently for a new policy aimed 
at protecting minors from child 
sexual 
abuse 
material. 
This 

backlash is ridiculous. And I support 
Apple’s decision to introduce new 
regulations and technology that 
“empowers people and enriches 
their lives.”

Last month, I moved back to my 

childhood home where I finally 
confronted my hoarder tendencies 
and upturned a closet flooded with 
Zhu Zhu pets, my Rainbow Loom 
kit, Orbeez, a Nintendo DS and too 
many Silly Bandz and Sticky Hands. 
As old memories began to surge back 
into my mind, I couldn’t help but 
think about the experiences of kids 
that enter into an already present 
social media world. It is frustrating 
and concerning that younger kids 
confront the same space that gives 
adults body insecurities and adverse 
mental health effects; that they live 
in a world where cyberbullying is 
widespread and normal. 

How are we changing, really? 

How is technology changing us? 
A recent Ezra Klein Show episode 
on The New York Times hosted 

guest L.M. Sacasas, author of the 
newsletter The Convivial Society, 
to discuss 41 questions concerning 
technology. Sacasas pulls from 
20th-century 
philosophers 
of 

technology to argue that technology 
is not an innocent medium — we 
become these tools and are reshaped 
by them. The choices we make and 
the habits we form in the virtual 
world spill out and become reality. 
His questions directed me to take 
a backseat from the technocentric 
screen and consider our generation’s 
relationship with technology: 

When 
we 
spew 
unfiltered, 

negative comments just because 
we can’t see the person behind the 
screen, what sort of person does that 
make us? When we fill open cracks 
of time with a subconscious, trained 
flick of the thumb to open Snapchat 
or 
TikTok, 
what 
experiences 

does that prevent? What rituals, 
conversations, 
relationships, 

spontaneous moments? When we 
post on Instagram and obsessively 
submit to ‘like’ and follower counts, 
are we being authentic to ourselves 
or are we just performances 
ourselves, hungry for the audience’s 
approval? When we persist in a 
toxic relationship with social media 
platforms, is it anxiety and fear 
keeping us hanging on? Why do we 
continue? 

In a place where saying anything 

is better than saying nothing, 
misinformation thrives. This form 
of social media undermines us and 
makes our lives worse. 

In its infant stage, social media 

was seemingly innocent, welcoming 
society with boundless freedom and 
individual expression (remember 
the world of Dylan O’Brien’s 
homemade sketches on YouTube, 

or very random highly filtered 
Instagram posts?) Because of that 
nostalgic optimism, I understand 
the hesitation or objections to 
regulation that feels as though 
companies are stealing the magic 
of the virtual society. People are 
afraid of limited rights, reveling in 
the current state of nature where 
we stand as equal beings without a 
form of government and legislature 
to restrain us. 

In 
the 
political 
sphere, 

libertarians value a minimal state 
and maximum individual rights. 
They hate being used for the sake 
of others’ welfare (think seatbelt 
laws or income redistribution from 
the rich to the poor). Applied to the 
virtual society, I think it’s analogous 
to hating regulation as a means for 
the collective welfare of technology 
users 
(think 
privacy 
breach 

complaints amidst efforts of child 
pornography surveillance). 

John Locke argues that there 

are inconveniences in a state of 
nature, 
namely 
over-aggression 

in punishment and heightened 
violence, which ultimately leaves 
people insecure in their enjoyment 
of their inalienable rights. Users 
“cancel” influencers in extreme 
measures, often accompanied by 
suicide threats. 

Sometimes we find ourselves 

overcome with unbearable anxiety 
in a toxic environment and delete 
social media apps for weeks. In our 
developing virtual society, we need 
to find civility and recover the ability 
to enjoy our rights to life, liberty 
and happiness by striking a balance 
between individual rights and the 
common good.

B

itcoin is, for the time being, 
on the up and up. Earlier 
this year, Venmo, a financial 

services company, announced that 
it will be incorporating Bitcoin 
transactions into its platform, as the 
currency recently surpassed a record 
value of $63,000 per coin. Though 
Bitcoin has many benefactors in the 
tech executive class and beyond, this 
cryptocurrency has limited utility 
compared to the cost that it takes to 
maintain the entire system. . 

An indictment of Bitcoin is not an 

indictment of blockchain technology 
— the multi-agent authentication 
system on which Bitcoin operates — or 
its many other uses. Bitcoin, outside of 
the fact that it is a bubble likely to pop, 
creates more problems for the world 
than it solves.

Bitcoin has prominent proponents, 

such as Twitter and Square CEO Jack 
Dorsey and the Winklevoss twins. It 
makes sense — a democratized, purely 
digital currency is exactly the kind of 
futuristic, disruptive thing tech CEOs 
flock to. But why is it appealing? What 
problem is Bitcoin meant to solve? 

Proponents will give you a number 

of answers. The currency is meant 
to escape the harmful oversight of 
a central bank, which is allegedly 
devaluing the money of hard-working 
Americans. You may have heard a 

similar argument from proponents 
of gold. In reality, the fluctuations 
in Bitcoin are otherworldly when 
compared to the stable inflation rate of 
the U.S. dollar. Even Bitcoin’s original 
selling point of complete anonymity is 
going down the drain, as many of the 
Bitcoin exchange services do in fact 
require a verified identity.

Bitcoin is much more an (volatile) 

investment 
opportunity 
than 
a 

revolutionary way to do commerce. 
Economist Nouriel Roubini has called 
Bitcoin “the mother of all scams” 
because of how it preys on the least 
financially literate with promises of 
revolutionizing the financial systems 
and the possibility to develop extreme 
personal wealth. In a speech this 
August, Gary Gensler, Securities 
and Exchange Commission chair, 
called for stricter regulation of the 
cryptocurrency 
market. 
Gensler 

called the current market “like the 
Wild West” in terms of protection for 
vulnerable new investors.

Those already bought into Bitcoin 

have the most incentive to encourage 
new investors to buy into the currency 
because that is the way their personal 
Bitcoin fortune can increase in value. 
In the same way that many first-time 
investors were left high and dry after 
the GameStop situation earlier this 
year, if the hype train slows down, 
millions of Bitcoin holders will be left 
holding the check.

Bitcoin has an environmental 

impact 
as 
well. 
Every 
Bitcoin 

transaction 
consumes 
around 

500,000 times more energy to 
authenticate than a traditional online 
transaction. The immense energy cost 
of Bitcoin is built into the platform. 
Miners, or different computers all 
over the world who would like to 
authenticate, are all competing with 
each other for blocks, or groups, of 
transactions. This competition, while 
making the platform secure, also 
wastes incredible amounts of money on 
redundancy. Though Bitcoin “mines” 
are sometimes built in colder climates 
to alleviate some of the energy cost 
associated with cooling, (at this stage 
in the technology) Bitcoin mining still 
manages to consume more energy than 
the entire country of Finland.

Cryptocurrencies 
are 
already 

classified as securities and are thus in 
SEC jurisdiction in some regard, but 
the issue of taxes is still a weak point 
in the American crypto regulation 
scheme. Hopefully, cryptocurrencies 
will be coming under more stringent 
tax regulations soon. 

The 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 

bill passed by the Senate includes a 
provision that would require crypto 
“brokers” to report their client’s 
cryptocurrencies transactions, much 
like how stockbrokers are required to 
report their client’s stock transactions 
to tax regulators. This reasonable 
change is expected to bring in $28 
billion in previously untaxed revenue.

Bitcoin is more trouble than it’s worth

Apple isn’t the problem, we are.

AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY

LSA LECTURE

On 
Wednesday, 
Michigan 

offensive coordinator Josh Gat-
tis referred to the Wolverines’ 
running back tandem of sopho-
more Blake Corum and senior 
Hassan Haskins as “the perfect 
combination of thunder and 
lightning.” 

Against Washington on Sat-

urday night, the duo certainly 
lived up to their billing. 

In a game where junior 

quarterback Cade McNamara 
threw for just 44 yards, Haskins 
and Corum paced Michigan’s 
offense, 
combining 
for 
326 

rushing yards, 48 carries and all 
four Wolverine touchdowns in a 
31-10 victory. 

“That warms the cockles of 

the heart to be able to do that, 
run the ball that way,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said after 
the game. “... (Washington was) 
just having a hard time tackling 
the backs. When we started 
breaking the edge pressure, 
there were some real creases in 
between the tackles. Our guys 
hit them.” 

In the week leading up to the 

game, 
Michigan 
recognized 

that 
Washington’s 
defense 

boasted a formidable second-
ary. As a result, the Wolverines 
geared their gameplan to the 
trenches. 

Through the first half, the 

Huskies rotated between an 
array of defensive looks, none of 
which proved capable of slow-
ing down Michigan’s relentless 
ground game. 

“We knew coming into this 

game that we wanted to run 
the ball and we wanted to run 

it down their throat,” senior 
offensive tackle Ryan Hayes 
said. “With backs like we have, 
it makes it pretty easy for the 
o-line. We knew going into this 
game that we were going to run 
the ball as much as we could 
because they couldn’t really 
stop it.” 

In the early going, Haskins 

helped set the game’s tone, 
notching three quick carries 
for 32 yards, highlighted by a 
16-yard burst. Shortly after-
wards, Corum made his mark 
with a 68-yard touchdown run 
along the Washington sideline, 
utilizing his speed to dust the 
safety. 

The opening drive of the sec-

ond half stands as a poster boy 
for the Wolverines’ success run-
ning the ball. In four minutes, 
Michigan marched down the 
field for an eight-play, 73-yard 
touchdown drive. Each of the 
eight plays resulted in a hand-
off, with Haskins running for 
39 yards and Corum recording 
34 yards, along with the touch-
down. 

“We knew they were getting 

defeated towards the end of the 
game and we just kept hitting 
them and hitting them and hit-
ting them,” Hayes said. 

In fall camp, as Michigan 

spoke of a desire to establish an 
identity as a running-oriented 
team, questions loomed over 
how Corum and Haskins would 
handle a split-workload. Two 
games in, those apprehensions 
have certainly been quelled, 
as neither Western Michigan 
last week, nor Washington this 
week, has managed to stop 
them. 

“We just kinda feed off each 

other,” Corum said. “We don’t 

go into the game thinking, ‘I’m 
going to get this many carries, 
you’re gonna get this many car-
ries.’ We just kinda go with the 
flow.” 

The pair complement each 

other 
admirably. 
Haskins, 

dependable and bruising, is at 
his best in between the tack-
les; Corum, a human highlight 
reel, is most explosive on the 
edge. 

And, even when one of 

Corum or Haskins receives the 
bulk of the carries, the other is 
still incorporated into the play. 
It’s indicative of Michigan’s 
desire to play through both of 
them on offense, especially in 
the absence of senior receiver 
Ronnie Bell, who stood as the 
Wolverines’ most potent threat 
on the perimeter. 

Against Washington, Corum 

and Haskins combined for four 
of McNamara’s seven comple-
tions. 

“It 
definitely 
puts 
other 

teams in a (difficult) situation, 
cause you don’t really know who 
to stop,” Corum said. “And then 
sometimes, when we’re in the 
backfield together, at the same 
time, that’s probably a little dif-
ficult also.” 

For the long-haul, this sort of 

run-dominant approach figures 
to be unsustainable; at some 
point, the Wolverines will have 
to rely on McNamara to air the 
ball out. 

That’s something Michigan 

surely recognizes. But through 
two games, Corum and Haskins 
are wreaking havoc, leaving lit-
tle need for anything else. 

“We’re 
running 
backs,” 

Haskins said. “So if we get to 
run it a lot, that’s no problem 
with us.”

Corum, Haskins duo dominate the 

offense against the Huskies

JARED GREENSPAN
Daily Sports Editor

From the moment Saturday’s 

game kicked off, it was clear 
the Michigan football team’s 
defense wouldn’t give an inch.

With a “Maize Out” crowd 

of 108,345 at their back, the 
Wolverines forced a three-
and-out on Washington’s first 
drive. The Huskies’ next series 
went four yards in the wrong 
direction; their third drive 
only netted two yards. Three 
quick punts electrified Michi-
gan Stadium as the Wolverines’ 
offense established an early 
lead.

All 
told, 
Michigan 
held 

Washington to a paltry 18 yards 
in the first quarter and didn’t 
surrender any first-half points, 
setting the tone in what ulti-
mately became a telling 31-10 
win over a Washington team 
that debuted in the top 20 of 
the AP Poll just two weeks ago.

“Seeing the defense ball 

out like that, it motivates us,” 
sophomore running back Blake 
Corum said. “Now it’s our turn 
to do better and I think that’s 
what we did throughout the 
game. The defense had a phe-
nomenal game, they kept shut-
ting them out. I think it just put 
a little fire in us and motivated 
us to do a little bit better.”

It feels like a lifetime ago, but 

some of Michigan’s best teams 
under coach Jim Harbaugh 
have been built on defense. The 
Wolverines led the country in 
team defense in 2017, and the 
2018 team that fell a game short 
of the College Football Playoff 
finished the season ranked No. 
3 nationally in team defense. 

That once-vaunted defense 

crumbled in 2019 and 2020, 
leading to the firing of former 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown. Harbaugh replaced him 
with Baltimore Ravens defen-
sive assistant Mike Macdonald, 
who installed a brand new 3-4 
scheme this past offseason.

So far, the first-time coordi-

nator’s system has rejuvenated 
the Wolverines’ defense. That 
much was evident in Michi-
gan’s inspired play during Sat-
urday night’s win.

“Mike did a great job calling 

the defense,” Harbaugh said. 
“From an offensive perspec-
tive, Washington ran every-
thing known to man offensively 
in the first three quarters. 
And for the most part, three 
straight three-and-outs to start 
the game, that was huge. You 
talk about getting off to a fast 
start, that precipitated that. 
Four three-and-outs through-
out the course of the game. It 
was really, really strong.”

Despite throwing the kitch-

en sink at the Wolverines, 
Washington didn’t reach the 
red zone until the second half 
and failed to score a touch-
down until the fourth quarter. 
The Huskies struggled to block 
senior edge Aidan Hutchin-
son, who recorded 2.5 sacks, 
four tackles — three of which 
were solo — and a quarterback 
hurry. With NFL scouts from 
13 franchises in attendance, 
Hutchinson looked the part of 
a first-round draft pick.

With 
every 
Washington 

drive that fell apart, Hutchin-
son was at the center of the 
wreckage. He blew up numer-
ous short run plays in addition 
to his 2.5 sacks. His strong 

play in the trenches helped 
Michigan dominate the line of 
scrimmage — something the 
Wolverines’ own offensive line 
grew accustomed to as the sea-
son approached. 

“(The 
Huskies) 
couldn’t 

block Aidan,” Harbaugh said. 
“In fall camp, we couldn’t block 
him either.”

Added senior offensive line-

man Ryan Hayes: “It’s a really 
fun back and forth when we’re 
in practice. It’s really nice hav-
ing Aidan on that side of the 
ball because we’re not really 
going to face anyone better 
than him this year.”

The defensive dominance 

stretched further than just 
Hutchinson, 
though. 
After 

allowing a 75-yard touchdown 
on Western Michigan’s open-
ing drive a week ago, the Wol-
verines needed time to settle 
in. That wasn’t the case in 
Week 2 — a major step forward 
on the preparation front.

Fifth-year senior lineback-

er Josh Ross found himself 
at the heart of that improve-
ment. His role in the middle of 
the defense affects everyone 
around him, allowing him to 
notice the contrast.

“For today, one of the things 

I was most proud of was how 
well we communicated and 
how much better we com-
municated from last week to 
this week,” Ross said. “There 
were a lot of formations, a lot 
of trickery. ... We were getting 
to certain calls that we never 
went over, but we sort of went 
out and handled it.”

And at this point in a young 

season, 
rapid 
improvement 

is the best thing Michigan 
could’ve possibly seen.

Wolverine defense stepped into the 

moment Saturday

DANIEL DASH

Daily Sports Editor

Each week, the No. 25 Michi-

gan football team practices a 
9-on-7 drill. 

Effectively, 
it’s 
football 

stripped down to its most 

basic components: the run-
ning back takes a handoff up 
the middle, and the defense 
tries to stop him. There’s 
no trickery, stunts or play 
actions. The drill merely tests 
if the offense’s blockers can 
out-duel the defense’s front 
seven. 

It’s old-school stuff, but in the 

offseason, the Wolverines gave it 
new meaning. 

“In years prior, we would call 

it 9-on-7, which is what the drill 
is,” junior offensive lineman 
Trevor Keegan said. “This year, 
we changed it to (the) Beat Ohio 
drill. Now, we’re blasting music, 
smelling salts, everything. And 
it’s a pretty physical period, and 
we love it.” 

In the grand scheme of things, 

renaming a drill will do little 
to close the canyon-sized gap 
between Michigan and Ohio 
State. Culture changes — espe-
cially when coming off a 2-4 sea-
son — are good, but they won’t be 
enough to turn the tables after 
losing the last three matchups 
to the Buckeyes by a combined 
score of 149-86. 

Still, the renewed intensity 

reflected in the “Beat Ohio” drill 
is already apparent in one aspect 
of the Wolverines’ performance: 
the offensive line. 

Through two games, the start-

ing five has paved the way for 
a whopping 678 rushing yards 
while allowing just six tackles for 
loss and one sack. To put that in 
perspective, Michigan managed 
just 786 rushing yards through 
all six games last season while 
forfeiting 4.5 tackles for loss and 
1.3 sacks per game. It’s still early, 
but there’s clearly some tangible 
progress on the offensive line. 

In Saturday’s 31-10 drubbing 

of Washington, Michigan fully 
embraced the mentality of estab-
lishing the run. Fifty-six of the 

Wolverines’ 71 offensive plays 
stayed on the ground. On aver-
age, each of those runs went for 
6.1 yards. That success came in 
large part thanks to the physical-
ity up front. 

“First off, I want to shout the 

o-line,” sophomore running back 
Blake Corum said Saturday. “As 
you guys saw today, they fired off 
the ball, they were real physical 
and they made (senior running 
back Hassan Haskins’s) and my 
job real easy.”

Even on the running backs’ 

highlight-reel 
plays, 
linemen 

could be seen clearing paths 
through the Huskies’ defense. 
For example, on Corum’s 67-yard 
touchdown run midway through 
the second quarter, he had a 

massive hole to run through 
thanks to solid down-blocking 
from Keegan, a strong kick-out 
block from pulling sixth-year 
center Andrew Vastardis and a 
touchdown-sealing hit on the 
second level from senior tackle 
Ryan Hayes. 

For the most part, Vastardis 

also anchored the line, seeming 
to get more push than anybody 
off the ball. Since being elected 
captain at the end of fall camp, 
he looks to have embraced the 
heavier expectations levied on 
him this season. 

“Vastardis is the leader of our 

o-line, the leader of our team,” 
Keegan said. “So he makes all the 
calls and stuff. We gelled really 
well in the spring together, and 

we’ve just been continuing to 
carry that on.”

Though later revealed to be 

just a cramp, an injury to Vas-
tardis late in the game offered 
a reminder as to how quickly 
things could fall apart for the 
Wolverines. Even if everyone 
remains healthy, caveats are 
always going to apply in wins 
against Western Michigan and a 
Washington team that lost to an 
FCS opponent. It remains to be 
seen whether the offensive line 
will be able to sustain this level 
of dominance up front against 
tougher teams. 

If the newly minted “Beat 

Ohio” drill is to be believed, 
the team is preparing for those 
challenges.

Through two games, Michigan’s offense looks settled into an identity

BRENDAN ROOSE

MILES MACKLIN/Daily 

Michigan’s offensive identity is channeled through the line, a clear result of the focus spent on it over the summer.

MILES MACKLIN/Daily 

Michigan fifth-year senior linebacker Josh Ross totaled 11 tackles, four solo, and three quarterback hurries.

LUKE HALES/Daily 

Michigan sophomore running back Blake Corum rushed for 171 yards and three touchdowns on Saturday.


Despite its winning record heading into Friday’s 

matchup against No. 12 New Hampshire, the 
Michigan men’s soccer team had yet to play a 
complete game well. The Wolverines’ slow starts 
have led to missed opportunities and have forced 
them to play catch-up with the opposing team. 
Michigan hoped to change this narrative, but this 
game was no different, as the team fell, 1-0.

The Wolverines’ offense struggled mightily in 

the first half. They were unable to convert on passes 
in the offensive zone, allowing the Wildcats to take 
the ball up the field and into Michigan’s final third 
for most of the first half. The Wildcats dominated 
in the Wolverines’ box, creating numerous scoring 
chances, but Michigan held them off with timely 
saves and great stops by freshman goalkeeper 
Hayden Evans and fifth-year defender Austin 
Swiech. 

In the 38th minute, New Hampshire punished 

the Wolverines for their inability to retain 
possession and take shots. Midfielder Bilal Kamal’s 
goal put New Hampshire up 1-0, and it appeared as 
if the Wildcats were going to walk away handedly 
with a win. 

At halftime, though, Michigan came out of the 

tunnel looking like a completely different team. 

“I think we absolutely tore them apart in the 

second half,” Michigan coach Chaka Daley said. 
“They were fortunate to get out of here with a win.”

The team’s fire and poise were plain to see. The 

Wolverines tallied eight shots in the second half, 
which created many scoring opportunities. But 
even with the dominant second half, Michigan was 
unable to equalize.

Twenty-two minutes into the second half, 

Michigan had the ball in the Wildcats’ zone. 
Effective passing led to a shot on target by Swiech 
that rebounded off of New Hampshire goalkeeper 
Jassem Koleilat. The rebound led to an even better 
chance by junior forward Evan Rasmussen, but the 
rebound opportunity went over the crossbar.

“We had five legit chances in and around 

the box in the second half,” Daley said. “I’m not 
discouraged in any way, shape or form: for a group 
like that (New Hampshire) to come in here with all 
those players with good experience and for us to 
take it to them in the second half, I’m encouraged, 
not discouraged.” 

Even with Daley’s words, Michigan has struggled 

to score offensively throughout the season, scoring 
only five goals in five games. If the Wolverines want 
to remain competitive in the Big Ten, they will need 
to find the back of the net more often.

In 
a 
game 
billed 
to 
be 
Michigan’s 

first big test of the season, the 
results are … dubious. Sure, the 
Wolverines 
beat 
Washington 

by three touchdowns and its 
defense looked impenetrable for 
most of the 
game, when 
Michigan 
usually 
struggles 
in 

big matchups.

But 
also, 

how good is 
Washington 
really, 
and 

what 
in 

tarnation was that offense?

The Huskies don’t seem primed 

to be a contender in the PAC-12, 
and maybe the embarrassing loss 
to FCS Montana wasn’t a fluke. 
All told, this game is probably not 
the test we thought it would be 
when Washington was ranked 
20th at the start of the season, and 
the “lessons learned” may just be 
built on a house of cards.

The running game, though, 

seems built with brick walls. It 
is a unit that, at least, can lead 
Michigan toward a season that 
matches its (more reasonable) 
preseason 
expectations. 

Doomsayers won’t have to worry 

about embarrassing losses to 
bottom-feeders 
Maryland, 

Rutgers or Nebraska if the 
Wolverines can pound the rock 
like that.

“It means a lot to me knowing 

that we have two solid running 
backs (and) that we can run the 
ball and do the things we’ve 
done the last two weeks, I think 
it’s 
phenomenal,” 
sophomore 

running back Blake Corum said. 
“It definitely puts other teams in 
a situation, cause you don’t really 
know who to stop.”

This ‘thunder and lightning’ 

pairing of Corum and senior 
running back Hassan Haskins 
offense is the new evolution of 
Michigan’s offense, closer to 
the early days of Jim Harbaugh. 
The days of Karan Higdon and 
De’Veon Smith, when running 
was the first-choice option and 
the floor seemed to be 8-5, with 
the ceiling one yard short of the 
playoffs. 

The offenses of Michigan have 

evolved since then, but the one 
thing they all have in common is 
their ceiling: below Ohio State. 

And that’s a pattern of behavior 

that some Michigan fans have 
said time and time again is not 
enough.

But that Washington game 

also gives glimmers of hope on the 
other side of the ball, the defense. 
One of the biggest weaknesses of 
last season for the Wolverines, the 
changes seem to have made this 
defense formidable. But shutting 
down Western Michigan, a good 
MAC team — but a MAC team 
nonetheless — and Washington, 
which scored seven points against 
Montana, aren’t necessarily good 
measuring sticks. 

The 
stats 
are 
there 
for 

Michigan: It notched the third-
most 
rushing 
yards 
under 

Harbaugh’s tenure on Saturday 

with 343. On the defensive end, 
it held Washington to 50 rushing 
yards.

Conversely, 
Michigan 
is 

averaging 33.5 more rushing 
attempts than passing attempts 
through its first two games. The 
next-closest Big Ten champion in 
the playoff era is Ezekiel Elliott’s 
2014 Ohio State, which averaged 
18.7 more rushing plays than 
passing. 

But what made that team 

even more dangerous was its 
passing ability. It took big shots 
and kept defenses honest through 
explosive passing plays.

The Wolverines, meanwhile, 

have recorded 60% of their 
passing yards on two plays, both 
against Western Michigan, and 
are averaging 130 passing yards a 
game. They didn’t want (or need) 
to utilize the passing game to 
beat the Huskies, but that won’t 
be true forever. 

Against teams as talented 

as the Buckeyes or Penn State, 
running every play won’t get 
you anywhere in an eight-man 
box. Junior quarterback Cade 
McNamara will need to be more 
than just the game manager 
offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 
has deemed him to be. To finish 
better than 8-4, McNamara will 
have to make game-changing 
plays.

Can he? We don’t know yet. 
The great yardstick that was 

Washington turned out to be 
no more useful than the game 
against 
Western 
Michigan. 

The next test — a real test — for 
Michigan will be at Wisconsin, on 
Oct. 2. Until then, we won’t be able 
to figure out if this is a mediocre, 
good or great team.

Missed scoring 

opportunities hamper 
Michigan in 1-0 loss

Michigan senior running back Hassan Haskins averaged 5.7 yards per 
carry with a long of 20 yards.

Wednesday, September 15, 2021 — 11

Trailing 
1-0 
in 
the 
66th 

minute, junior forward Evan 
Rasmussen slid the ball past 
the New Hampshire defenders 
to sophomore midfielder Bryce 
Blevins. Blevins took aim from 
inside the 18-yard box and fired 
a shot into the left-side netting, 
failing to put it on target.

Blevins’s scoring opportunity 

was one of many for the Michigan 
men’s soccer team (2-2-1) in the 
second 
half, 
but 

none 
found 
the 

back of the net. As 
such, No. 12 New 
Hampshire 
(5-0-

0) 
escaped 
Ann 

Arbor with a 1-0 
victory 
over 
the 

Wolverines.

New 

Hampshire’s 
single goal came 
off of a corner 
kick in the 38th 
minute. The ball 
took a deflection 
in Michigan’s box, 
falling at the feet of 
Wildcat junior Bilal 
Kamal, who then 
swiftly placed it in 
the top right corner 
of Michigan’s net.

With the Wolverines losing 1-0, 

Blevins’s opportunity sparked a 
momentum change in U-M Soccer 
Stadium. The fans got louder and 
the offense opened up for the 
Wolverines. A mere two minutes 
after Blevins’s chance, fifth-year 
defender Austin Swiech fired a 
shot on goal after the ball landed 
at his feet following a Michigan 
corner kick. New Hampshire 
goalkeeper 
Jassem 
Koleilat 

saved the shot, but it bounced 
back to Rasmussen for another 
opportunity. Koleilat was there to 
make the save yet again, keeping 
the lead intact for the Wildcats.

“I think we absolutely tore 

them apart (in the second half),” 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley 
said. “They were fortunate to get 
out of here. But, the game is about 
margins. They had a real chance 
to miss in the first half, a half-
chance they scored on, and we had 
five legit chances in and around 
the box in the second half.”

The Wolverines finished the 

game with 10 shots, eight of which 
came in the second half. New 
Hampshire finished with 11 shots, 
five of which came in the second 
half.

Despite the loss, there were 

many positives for the Wolverines 
to build off of going forward.

Rasmussen 
displayed 
a 

knack for finding the ball in 
scoring positions throughout 
the game, as his three shots 
led the Wolverines. His best 
chance came in the 85th minute 
when he found the ball at his 
feet shortly after a Michigan 
free kick was played into the 
box. Rasmussen fired a rocket 
toward the top left corner of 
the net, but Koleilat managed 
to tip it over the crossbar for a 
Michigan corner kick. 

Another bright spot for the 

Wolverines was the talent on 
display by their underclassmen.

Freshman 
defender 
Jason 

Bucknor swept past opposing 
players with the ball at his feet, 
making it look easy in the process. 
After pushing up the field in the 
84th minute, he played a cross into 
the middle of the box that could 
have produced a goal on another 
day.

Despite pushing forward into 

the attack, Bucknor’s most notable 
moment came in the Wolverines’ 
defensive third. With a Wildcat 
pressuring him from behind, 

Bucknor displayed 
some flair, flicking 
the ball into the 
air and clearing it 
with an impressive 
overhead kick.

Another 

underclassman 
with an impressive 
performance 
was 
freshman 

goalkeeper 
Hayden Evans. In 
the 84th minute, 
New 
Hampshire 

forward 
Victor 

Menudier got on 
the end of a long 
pass 
and 
found 

himself one-on-one 
with Evans. Evans 
stayed 
composed, 

managing to deflect Menudier’s 
shot to the right of the net, and 
ultimately finished the game with 
four saves.

Despite 
some 
strong 

performances, 
this 
young 

Wolverine team ultimately fell 
short Friday.

“Everything is not always 

going to go your way. And again, 
that doesn’t mean you need to 
concede goals, right, or concede 
momentum,” Daley said. “You’ve 
still got to be comfortable in your 
own skin if things are against you. 
Just kind of weather the storm, 
a little bit, and that comes with a 
little bit of maturity.”

Blown fourth set downs Wolverines

With the game in its infancy, 

the Michigan women’s soccer 
team made a rare mistake:

It turned the ball over in 

its defensive third. Cincinnati 
midfielder Lauren Bastian moved 
the ball to forward Vanessa 
DiNardo, who took the first shot 
of the game and scored.

The 16th-ranked Wolverines 

(6-1-1 overall) then found their 
backs against the wall, a position 
that 
felt 
unfamiliar; 
usually, 

they take the ball early and 
relentlessly attack the opposition. 
Cincinnati neutralized that attack 
all through the first half, and 
Michigan looked like it would 
return home from its weekend 
road trip without a win.

Heading into the locker room 

at 
halftime, 
the 
Wolverines 

needed a change.

“We 
were 
kind 
of 
the 

underdogs in that moment, and 
we decided we’ve got 45 minutes 
to change that,” senior midfielder 
Raleigh Loughman said. “It’s a 
Sunday game, so you’ve always 
gotta fight it out. We went into 
that with a fighting mindset.”

That mindset led to a pair of 

second-half goals and guided 
Michigan’s 
approach 
to 
its 

weekend road games. On Friday, 
after tying Louisville (4-1-1) at 
a goal apiece in a game where 
they dominated possession, the 
Wolverines utilized their deep 
roster to battle for a 2-1 win 
against Cincinnati (4-3-1).

Michigan’s offense has found 

a consistent pattern this season. 
It generates dozens of shots 
every game, but struggles to turn 
them into goals. The Wolverines 
addressed those challenges this 
weekend.

Against 
the 
Cardinals, 

Michigan started the game in 
its usual position: the driver’s 
seat. Fifth-year senior midfielder 
Nicki Hernandez scored the 
Wolverines’ goal in the 19th 
minute after Loughman and 
junior midfielder Dani Wolfe 
worked the ball past the defense.

But 
Michigan 
faced 
stiff 

competition following the goal. 
Midfielder Nina Nicosia slipped 
Louisville’s first shot of the game 
past fifth-year goalkeeper Hillary 
Beall in the 21st minute. The 
Wolverines dominated possession 
and made 24 shots, throwing all 
they had on net. But the finish that 
has eluded them all season proved 
absent once again.

Substitutions came early and 

often in both games. A calling 
card of Michigan’s team, those 
decisions kept the Wolverines’ 
energy 
high 
against 
both 

opponents. 
Michigan 
coach 

Jennifer Klein utilized 19 outfield 
players against the Cardinals and 
18 against the Bearcats.

“You’ve 
gotta 
trust 
your 

players,” Klein said. “And you 
have to trust that the work that 
they’re doing every week in 
practice is preparing them for 
those moments.”

In adjusting from its first 

game of the weekend, Michigan 
focused 
on 
maximizing 
the 

danger of its chances against 
Cincinnati. This was a marked 
change from Friday’s match in 
which the Wolverines peppered 
the 
goalkeeper 
with 
lower-

quality threats.

“Sometimes we can have a lot of 

shots, but they weren’t necessarily 
great opportunities,” Loughman 
said. “So I think we actually did 

better (against Cincinnati) with 
creating good opportunities.”

Cincinnati scored its early goal, 

but the Wolverines refused to roll 
over. As the midfield worked the 
ball toward the Bearcats’ goal, 
Loughman played deeper in the 
offensive zone. Senior midfielder 
Meredith Haakenson found a 
break in the Cincinnati defense, 
connecting with Loughman for a 
goal. Michigan had drawn even in 
the 62nd minute.

Loughman wasn’t done scoring 

though. Her deep pressure forced 
a yellow card from Cincinnati 
midfielder Taylor Nuncio that 
resulted 
in 
a 
penalty 
kick. 

Loughman ripped it deep into the 
net in the 64th minute, giving her 
team the lead. After a back-and-
forth battle the rest of the game, 
Beall put the finishing touches on 
the Wolverines’ victory when she 
snagged a penalty kick in the 87th 
minute.

Michigan’s changes had paid 

off.

The result in Louisville wasn’t 

what 
Michigan 
wanted, 
but 

the team switched its approach 
after a slow start in Cincinnati. 
Questions 
about 
finishing 

opportunities came closer to 
answers than they’ve been all 
season, which bodes well as the 
Wolverines enter a tough Big Ten 
campaign.

‘M’ utilizes adjustments to come 
away from road trip with win, draw

JACK GLANVILLE

For The Daily

CONNOR EAREGOOD

Daily Sports Writer
Victory 
against 
North 

Carolina was in their hands 
in front of an energetic crowd 
at 
Crisler 
Center. 
Leading 

the match 2-1 and building a 
comfortable 23-18 lead in the 
fourth set, all the Wolverines 
needed was two points to hand 
the Tar Heels their first loss of 
the season. 

But two points were evidently 

too much for Michigan. 

Instead, 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball team (4-2 overall) 
crumbled under a punishing 
7-0 run from North Carolina. 
Despite 
calling 
multiple 

timeouts and making difficult 
digs to extend points, the 
Wolverines had no answer 
for 
outside 
hitter 
Mabrey 

Shaffmaster’s aerial assault. 

The freshman carried out 
four demoralizing kills in the 
final seven points to secure 
the set that would propel 
the Tar Heels to a five-set 
victory.

“(Shaffmaster) started just 

teeing off,” Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen said. “... And 
next thing you know, now all 
of a sudden the momentum’s 
spinning.” 

Before 
Shaffmaster’s 

mastery at the net, however, 
Michigan was cruising in the 
would-be-clinching fourth set.

Early in the set, junior 

middle blockers Jess Robinson 
and May Pertofsky combined 
for an emphatic rejection of 
a Shaffmaster attack. Their 
block traveled near the back 
line of the court, soaring past 
the North Carolina defense and 
out of reach. 

Senior outside hitter Paige 

Jones, who was quiet earlier 
in the match, was starting to 
heat up. Following a clean set 
by sophomore setter Scottee 
Johnson, Jones ran up the 
sideline 
and 
took 
flight, 

launching the volleyball into 
the face of North Carolina 
outside hitter Parker Austin for 
a savage kill that tied the game 
at four. 

Two 
points 
later, 
Jones 

continued her display of force, 
attacking Austin once again. 
This time, Austin managed to 
get a hand on the ball, but it 

shanked out of bounds and into 
the stands. 

Jones entered into a serious 

rhythm 
by 
the 
middle 
of 

the game. At 12-9, she was 
commanding the outside with 
multiple strong attacks that 
had the Tar Heel defense 
scrambling. She then ran in 
for a finishing blow following 
another great set from Johnson 
to finish the lengthy point. 

The array of kills from 

Jones had the defense on their 
heels. Eyeing a clean set, Jones 
leaped into the air and cocked 

her hand back. Expecting yet 
another strong attack, North 
Carolina retreated, only for 
Jones to roll-shot the ball over 
the net, landing on the floor 
before a sprawling Tar Heel 
could dig. The crafty kill put 
the Wolverines up 16-12, and 
momentum was squarely with 
them. 

“We have four really good 

scoring positions,” Rosen said. 
“We were playing very well. … 
We were playing phenomenal.” 

The 
phenomenal 
play 

continued for Michigan as 
sophomore outside hitter Jess 
Mruzik, coming off a career-
high 
31 
kill 
performance 

on Friday, painted the back 
corner of the court for an ace, 
forcing North Carolina to call a 
timeout. 

The 
Wolverine 
lead 

continued to grow, but at 23-18, 
a block by Austin and middle 
blocker Skyy Howard on an 
attack by Jones turned the tide, 
sparking the 7-0 run that ended 
the game. Following Michigan’s 
collapse, it was clear the tables 
of the match had turned. 

With 
the 
Tar 
Heels 

rallying, 
the 
crowd 
grew 

loud 
in 
response, 
but 
a 

miscommunication 
involving 

Jones led to a service ace by 
defensive specialist Karenna 
Wurl, 
whose 
serve 
landed 

relatively slowly onto the floor 
with no defender there to pass, 
bringing the margin within 
two.

With the score tied at 23, 

Robinson’s attack was rejected 
by outside hitter Kaya Merkler. 
Next, it was none other than 
Shaffmaster who ended the 
furious comeback with yet 
another kill. 

The 
momentum 
North 

Carolina carried after its late 
surge was too much for the 
Wolverines to overcome in the 
final frame, as they lacked a 
consistent attack and made a 
handful of unforced errors in 
the 15-9 fifth-set loss.

“It’s easy to say, ‘Hey let’s 

just move on to the next set,’ ” 
Rosen said. “But that’s a hard 
hurdle to kind of get over. … 
(This was) hopefully a good 
learning opportunity for us.”

Poor first half spells doom for 
Michigan in ranked matchup

PAUL NASR

Daily Sports Writer

Confirming its newly minted 

No. 1 national ranking, the 
Michigan field hockey team 
made a statement in a 12-0 rout 
of Ball State in its home opener 
on 
Friday. 
The 
Cardinals 

were 
prevented 
from 
even 

attempting to make a dent in 
the score, finishing with zero 
shots and zero corners in the 
game.

In contrast, the Wolverines 

posted 39 total shots, 33 of 
which were on goal. Notably, 
none 
of 
Michigan’s 
goals 

came off a corner shot, despite 
the Wolverines receiving 14 
opportunities to do so. In the 
three games since their 3-2 
dogfight over former No. 1 
North Carolina, Michigan has 
scored 22 unanswered goals and 
allowed only six shots.

While 
seven 
Michigan 

players joined in on Friday’s 
scoring, senior midfielder Sofia 
Southam provided the plurality 
of the goals, scoring five and 
breaking the Michigan record 
for goals in a single game, 
previously set at four by Rachael 
Mack in 2013. 

“It feels great, but it’s a team 

sport, there’s no one single 
person,” Southam said. “We’ve 
always had this great team 
connection.”

Asked about the dominant 

start to the season, Southam 
emphasized 
the 
team’s 

mentality.

“We’re not focusing on the 

outcome, we’re focusing on 
doing the right thing every 
practice, every play,” Southam 
said. “We’re keeping it day-by-
day, game-by-game.”

For the Wolverines, any fears 

of fatigue from their springtime 
national runner-up campaign 
appear to be unfounded. With 
this year’s finals being hosted 
in Ann Arbor in the 20th 
anniversary year of Michigan’s 
lone national title win, Michigan 
coach Marcia Pankratz — who 
has led the team to all five of 
its Final Four appearances — 
welcomed her team’s early-
season play as they look toward 
a formidable Big Ten conference 
season and beyond.

“We’re a very deep and 

versatile team, so we can run 
lines almost like an ice hockey 
game,” Pankratz said. “(The 
team is) going to play as hard 
as they can until they get tired 

and switch out. In practice, the 
younger players are getting reps 
at a high tempo against some 
of the country’s best players. 
They’re 
getting 
better 
and 

better and better.”

In addition to Southam’s 

five goals, senior forward Tina 
D’Anjolell 
also 
scored 
two 

goals in two shots. Freshman 
midfielder Abby Tamer led 
the team with two assists, 
adding a goal for three points 
in total. Redshirt senior mid-
back Emma Tamer and redshirt 
senior 
back 
Halle 
O’Neill 

finished second and third on 
the team in shots with six and 
five, respectively, but both 
players were unable to find the 
back of the net. Freshman back 
Emmy Tran and sophomore 
forward Katelyn Clarke scored 
their first career goals in the 
third 
and 
fourth 
quarters, 

respectively.

With this being Michigan’s 

first home game with fans 
since the 2019 season, emotions 
were high, both in the stands 
and on the field. Following the 
game, Pankratz summed up her 
elation:

“What a great night to play 

field hockey in Ann Arbor, 
right?”

No trouble for new No. 1 as Wolverines 

easily blow out Ball State

BY LANE KIZZIAH, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

Reflections on a last first day

Public Policy senior Maddi Walsh poked her 

head into the classroom while the rest of us milled 
awkwardly around the first floor of Weill Hall. We 
all stood quietly — awkwardly — not remembering 
the proper pre-class etiquette. At what point is it 
acceptable to walk into the room? How does one 
engage in small talk? Should I leave and come back 
just to avoid the sheer awkwardness? The things 
that should’ve been second nature as I entered my 
16th year of school were now completely foreign 
after almost two years of online learning.

Growing up, I’d always gotten the pre-school 

butterflies. I’d make my mom take me back-to-
school shopping outrageously early so I could 
labor over the choices of which lunchbox would 
appropriately accent my third-grade experience 
and which brands of colored pens would improve 
my abysmal handwriting. As I’ve gotten older, the 
novelty of the first day has naturally worn off, but 
this year it all came flooding back.

I’d been looking forward to the start of 

school for weeks with the fervor of an anxious 
kindergartener. When the big day arrived, my 
roommates and I all tried on multiple outfits, and 
I’d spent an hour making sure all my books were 
in order, my water bottle filled, my iced coffee in 
just the right travel cup.

But when our professor, Megan Tompkins-

Stange, told Walsh we could come into the 
classroom, I felt an unexpected wave of anxiety. 
I was overwhelmed by the physical presence of 
the class, the rows of desks, the faces I recognized 
and those I didn’t, the professor at the front of the 
room.

And even beyond the social factors, there 

are new COVID-related taboos to think about. 
Is it rude to take a seat directly next to someone 
else? Should I leave room for them? Can I lower 
my mask and sip my water? All of these factors 
culminated in one all-important question: Where 
do I sit down?

After taking a quick scan of the masked faces 

around me, I chose a seat in the back. A few 
rows ahead of me, Walsh was having a similar 
experience.

“Something I didn’t realize until I got back here 

was that I haven’t introduced myself to someone 
in just so long in person,” she said. “That little 
small talk that you do with the people next to you 
that we didn’t get to do over Zoom, I totally forgot 
about all. It was so awkward.”

After getting to know someone over Zoom — 

at least as well as you can get to know someone 
through breakout-room chit-chat — it’s hard to 
gauge that first in-person interaction. I was sitting 
next to someone who I’ve sat on a Zoom with 
probably 100 times; I know her political opinions 
and what she thought of our professors, but I didn’t 
know her height or whether to introduce myself 
again. As I sat down, I tried to preoccupy myself 
with any task I could think of. I organized my 
pencils, took out all my books and put them back 
in my bag. I flipped through my planner, looking 
through a list of imaginary tasks to complete. A 
couple of times, I thought about saying hi, but in 
the end, I opted to sit in silence and wait for class 
to start.

Even professors felt the strange circumstances 

and first-day jitters. University of Michigan 
Education professor Matt Diemer is used to 
reading non-verbal cues from his students to 
assess their comprehension and engagement, 
something made much more difficult when 
everyone is wearing masks.

“I get 25% of the information from people’s 

faces I used to because I can’t see so much of 
people’s faces,” he said. “This isn’t to complain 
about masking — I think it’s important — but it’s 
just something I had not anticipated about what it 
would be like to be in the classroom again.”

Still, Diemer is excited to be back in person and 

looking forward to getting back to the aspects of 
teaching he missed even if it isn’t entirely normal. 
As he aptly put it, returning to the classroom is a 
double-edged sword.

“If you’re a freshman at Michigan or you’re a 

first-year graduate student, you’re excited about 
going, and it’s been a lifelong goal for you to go 
there maybe, but it’s still a new challenge, a new 
stressful situation that always kind of introduces 
normative stresses,” Diemer said. “I think just 
transition periods are difficult because they’re 
new and novel and may take us out of our habits 
and routine, so they introduce some stress. 
They’re also great things but it’s stress at the same 
time.”

Business sophomore Claire Strimling is 

essentially living the freshman transition a year 
late. Even though she was in Ann Arbor for all of 
last year, she only had one hybrid class.

“It was really, really amazing being in person 

and just being with other people,” she said. “I 
don’t even think I realize how many people went 
to Michigan.”

Though she prefers in-person learning, 

Strimling was worried that her classes this 
semester would be harder than the ones she 
took online. She went to a small high school in 
Las Vegas and is still learning to navigate the 
aspects of a big school — large class sizes and 
less face-to-face time with teachers — that most 
upperclassmen had the opportunity to adjust to as 
soon as we got on campus.

Even as a senior, I resonate with that idea 

of the freshman transition, in the best possible 
way. Underlying the awkwardness I felt was an 
overwhelming feeling of excitement. Last year, 
I would take most of my classes from my bed, 
occasionally turning off my camera to go make a 
sandwich or refill my coffee. I felt disconnected 
not just from my classes or classmates, but from 
the very idea of Michigan. This year, everything 
feels like a significant first: the first walk to class, 
the first assignment, the first time sitting in the 
library.

On my second day, I got lost in Mason Hall 

and ended up on the wrong floor. I took a quick 
lap in an effort to not look so blatantly lost and 
then snuck down the back stairs to my classroom. 
There was something in that moment that made 
me fall in love with Michigan all over again.

“(The start of in-person classes) brought 

kind of a sense of fulfillment back to my day,” 
Business senior Matt Kocsis said. “I guess just 
once again being able to go out on campus, seeing 
everybody also on the pilgrimage to class. Things 
felt certainly back to normal, and it was the energy 
and the enthusiasm that I’ve been so used to for so 
long.”

That energy has been palpable all over campus.
“It was really difficult for students and 

professors to truly have engaging conversations 
and not really being able to read body language 
and stuff (over Zoom),” LSA junior Lily Anderson 
added. “So I’ve loved being back in person with 
them and kind of having their energy to bounce 
off of and seeing how excited they are to be back in 
person as well has been really motivating.”

Even with this faux sense of normalcy, this is 

by no means a normal semester. After the first two 
weeks of classes, there have been 322 COVID-19 
cases reported on campus. By the second day of 
classes, LSA junior Stanley Wang had already 
gotten two email notifications that someone in 
his class had tested positive. COVID-19 was a 
major concern for him coming into the school 

year because many of his friends are international 
students who didn’t have access to the vaccine at 
home.

“I knew that (the email notifications) would 

happen, but I guess I didn’t know it would be that 
quick,” he said.

Kocsis is less concerned about the risk of 

infection. He feels comfortable knowing that such 
a high percentage of students are vaccinated and 
he has no underlying health concerns. Naturally, 
there’s a large range of feelings within the student 
body. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle, 
wanting to experience this year to the fullest but 
still holding a nagging sense of doubt in the back 
of our minds.

Many professors, Diemer included, have 

younger children at home who are not yet vaccine 
eligible. One of Diemer’s concerns coming into the 
semester was that students would be resistant to 
wearing masks, a fear that proved unfounded. 
Now with the first day behind us, Diemer is 
focused on being flexible.

“The challenges for professors are just trying 

to know what to expect, to try to be adaptive and 
flexible and customizable,” he said. “But at the 
same time, having a plan and a structure, so trying 
to thread some line between not being so rigid and 
totally unprepared if a student has to miss class 
because of a COVID exposure ... There’s a lot of 
invisible labor that professors are doing to try to 
be responsive and customizable, and this is labor 
I want to do. I think it’s important for students’ 
well-being and educational success, but being 
back in person, this term isn’t like every other 
term.”

It wasn’t a normal first day of school, and it 

won’t be a normal semester that follows. I’ve 
already gotten two notifications that someone 
in my classes has tested positive. The mixture of 
fear and optimism and excitement I have for the 
coming months is always changing. As Diemer 
said, we have to be adaptable.

But when my first class was over, I walked out 

alone, still unsure of how to navigate classroom 
chit-chat. On my walk home, I thought about my 
last first day of school and all the first days that 
came before it. Who knows what will happen in 
the next few months or whether we’ll be able to 
keep it up until the end of the semester. In that 
moment, I was just grateful that there were people 
on the street, backpack straps in hand, classes to 
go to.


Recently, I had a falling out with someone who 

told me in parting that they could, at the very least, 
always count on me to look out for myself. Not look 
after. Not take care of. Look out. As in, that ball is 
about to hit your head. Look out. Engage your 
defenses.

While I didn’t fight this, I can’t forget it, 

because weeks after the conversation I still find 
myself struggling to work through all the bitter 
complexities of the statement. Putting my needs 
first — is that not a base element of personhood? 
In the moment, I thought I was acting on what 
I knew about myself, what I knew about what I 
wanted. The swell of regret crept in, first slowly 
and then all at once. So pervasive was the doubt 
then, the feeling that I knew nothing about what 
was good for me. What happens when we think 
we know ourselves?

I don’t entirely know what is with the 

always randomly felt and forever forceful 
urge to be on my own, to ensure the fewest 
tethers — this is what I was acting on, what 
the plaintiff was referring to. Even when 
any sort of relationship seems to be going 
well, even if I’m with someone who I think 
is good for me, the urge still comes. Could 
my actions be driven by a questioning of 
what I feel I deserve? Moving through life 
acting on these defenses has always felt like 
acting on the opposite of principle, a shield 
against what may or may not be a true self, 
an unlovable self.

There’s an important difference in 

connotation between taking care of and 
looking out for oneself, it seems; while the 
former is often touted as a necessary, emo-
tionally conscious act of fulfilling one’s 
own needs, the latter is rife with defense 
and paranoia — looking out as if always on 
guard, watching, waiting.

Solitude feels safe, but also, crucially, not 

always what I imagine it to be. Solitude is not 
always a night to yourself in a closed bed-
room exhausting the playlists or reading the 
books or watching the movies, the ones you 
have already seen. Sometimes, it’s lying restless in 
the dark and wishing you could go back and change 
it all. Sometimes solitude is just loneliness disguised 
in the thick manifest of expectation.

Last winter — and it always happens in winter 

— I experienced a bout of loneliness I had imposed 
on myself, like purgatory I felt I deserved. I kept 
wishing to be with someone, but then as soon as 
I was, reality was never what I imagined it to be: 
They sat in a chair at my desk instead of the cor-
ner of my bed, kissed me coming right instead of 
left and without the proverbial “spark” that Sev-
enteen magazine had always promised would 
accompany kissing. It was imperfect and over-
whelming and when the night ended, I would 
think back through every moment, what I had 
said, what I didn’t say. What I did do, what I didn’t. 
I had hardly tried to enjoy it.

I feel as though I’m full of sickly contradic-

tions, seeking and wanting this solitude while also 
wishing it didn’t have to be the case — wanting 
to be around nobody and everybody at the same 

time. Feeling ambivalence and even apathy about 
some things one minute, and then total fervor the 
next. Because as much as I hate to admit it, I don’t 
know myself nearly as well as I think I do.

It’s 2013 and a tired waiter is taking my fam-

ily’s order at dinner. Asks if we would like drinks. I 
shake my head, declining, and my mother laughs, 
ordering something for me anyway, claiming,

“Taylor, sometimes I know you better than you 

know yourself.”

She would go on to explain, “Once our drinks 

arrive and you don’t have one with your meal, 
you’ll want mine.” This presumption always both-
ered me, and not only because she was right, but 
because she had confidently surmised that know-
ing one pattern of behavior indicated that she 
knew my whole self. She wasn’t really saying that, 

but that’s how I saw the explanation then, and still 
see it now. She could have said that she, as both my 
mother and someone who was not me, saw pat-
terns that I could not, or would not, admit to. But I 
was 13 and my mother prefers maxims.

A cautious desire to understand what drives 

our perceptions of ourselves has dogged me ever 
since. We are presupposed to believe that if we 
know ourselves, we are well off — we have placed 
ourselves in a position to succeed. Once we are 
familiarized with our own styles of learning, 
behaving and feeling, it then follows that we can 
feel at peace with what we have experienced and 
felt and what we will experience and feel. These 
are possibilities, the books and movies and songs 
have said, where it is both possible and beneficial 
to know ourselves. But let’s not pretend that there 
aren’t limits, or that we haven’t already bought 
into its warped promise.

What have I already bought into? Perhaps it’s 

not just solitude that I seek, but an escape from 
being my own spectator. Maybe all these years of 

journaling have convinced me that if I’m able to 
articulate precisely how I feel, down to the tight 
clamp of an impulse, I can predict how any given 
situation might impact me. So maybe I’ve deluded 
myself.

Am I just a combination of predisposition, 

expected presentation of personality and actual 
desires, of which I have not even the slightest clue 
how much each factor is divided? And is that fine?

I take a Myers-Briggs test. I take an Ennea-

gram test. Their result pages show me bite-
sized pieces of information about who I am and 
why, my strengths and weaknesses, and as nice 
and neat as this information presents itself, I’m 
hesitant. It’s come too easily, I feel. Only 20 or 30 
thoughtful yet still general questions, and sud-
denly I’m known?

Philosophy and its concerns about the nature of 

the self have always interested me — its competing 
strains of thought, each on a determined search 
for answer and reason, while also making it clear 
that any definitive conclusions about human 
nature and our world cannot truly exist.

A most distrustful strain of philosophy, which 

has both intrigued and terrified me ever since I’ve 
come across it, is solipsism, first recorded by the 
Greek presocratic Gorgias. Solipsism is the theory 
that if the outside world and other’s minds cannot 
be known, the self is all that is sure to exist. Others, 
such as Anita Avramides of Stanford University, 
define it as, “the problem of other minds.”

John Horgan, a journalist best known for his 

1996 book “The End of Science,” elaborated on 
this idea in Scientific American, arguing, “As 
crazy as this proposition seems, it rests on a brute 
fact: each of us is sealed in an impermeable prison 
cell of subjective awareness.”

Horgan continues, “Even if you reject solipsism 

as an intellectual position, you sense it, emotion-

ally, whenever you feel estranged from others, 
whenever you confront the awful truth that you 
can never know, really know another person, and 
no one can really know you.” I find the solipsism 
problem to be a useful, even if sad, way of defin-
ing the loneliness in being yourself. It is written 
on the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo in Del-
phi, “Γνῶθι σεαυτόν.” Know thyself. It was then 
Shakespeare who wrote in his play “Hamlet,” 
“To thine own self be true.” These famed men 
realized the virtues in learning about yourself, in 
knowing your tendencies: Break bad patterns, feel 
more comfortable in various situations, plan and 
predict with accuracy. But these benefits, while 
admirable, don’t constitute knowing yourself. 
Maybe they do, in the limited sense. But not fully.

In E.M. Cioran’s “The Trouble With Being 

Born,” a collection of short, nihilistic phil-
osophical musings, he wrote, “Once we 
appeal to our most intimate selves, once we 
begin to labor and to produce, we lay claim 
to gifts, we become unconscious of our own 
gaps. No one is in a position to admit that 
what comes out of his own depths might be 
worthless. ‘Self-knowledge?’ A contradic-
tion in terms.”

It is incredibly difficult, if even possible, 

to see ourselves objectively. I’ll always have 
motives, and I can’t pretend to ignore them, 
or pretend they’re not pressing. The more I 
think about it, the more that I feel I can con-
clude that this delusion of self-knowledge 
is just human element, a completely natu-
ral response to the complex layers of our 
existence. I then wonder: Is the search for 
reason — the existence of philosophy — just 
a symptom of living?

There are, admittedly, parts of us that 

are easy to know — why we are uncomfort-
able in the face of affection, why we prefer 
outgoing people as friends, why we aspire 
to be certain things — those are the easy 
things, things which give us the impres-
sion that we do or could know ourselves. 
As Ali Smith would say in her best book, 

“Autumn,” “That’s the thing about things.”

Know this: There are hundreds of thousands 

of different versions of yourself that exist in the 
minds of others, people you have loved, hated, 
wanted or met for only a minute. People that you 
lock eyes with on the bus or with whom you share 
notes in class, people that could forget you when 
out of the periphery, or who could remember you 
until they die. Versions that if ever presented to 
you, may be unrecognizable.

There are hardly any definitive conclusions 

here — this is exactly what I’m trying to get at. You 
can know yourself, but never completely, or prop-
erly, and at long last, I think that’s just fine. It’s still 
a worthwhile pursuit. There’s the point: pursuit. 
Because no matter how many details of my early 
life I untangle in therapy sessions, no matter how 
much I try to intellectualize my emotions in my 
journals, there remain those slippery, ineluctable, 
unattractive truths. Ones that I will never fully 
know or understand. I don’t mind them now as 
much as I used to.

On knowing yourself

3 — Wednesday, September 

15, 2021 // The Statement

 
I was on the phone with my dad for seven min-
utes. I sat down on the worn, green loveseat, 
greatly appreciated over the summer. I was not 
expecting to talk with him that evening, but when 
he texted asking if he could call, I promptly dialed 
him back, remembering the rarity of being awake 
and on our phones at the same time. Two months 
earlier, I flew up to Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula, 
where I was perpetually busy as a summer camp 
counselor, and perpetually four hours behind my 
life back in Michigan.

My dad got right to the point: He had can-

cer. My mind searched for memories that could 
ground this situation into something I’ve experi-
enced before, and as it descended further into the 
past, the only thing it could grab onto was Holly-
wood reenacting a similar scene.

There is a certain drama that is portrayed in 

American films and television surrounding can-
cer; a certain weight is given to it, more so than 
other medical conditions. Saying the word out 
loud spits spikes into the conversation despite the 
gentle curves of its letters on the page. My reaction 
to the phrase when it painfully brushed its way 
out of my father’s lips, however, felt underwhelm-
ing in comparison to what one might anticipate. 
Perhaps I was surprised at how easily cancer 
infiltrated my life, my brain numbing to avoid this 
unwanted acquaintance. Or maybe I ignored it, 
pretending it never existed.

Seven minutes after the call began, I ended 

it, and minutes after that, I was in a Jeep rolling 
through the Alaskan backcountry. While my 
friends moved with the music and the dirt road 
beneath them, I was busy wrapped in internal 
guilt from the recent sequence of events.

Seven minutes? My dad just told me he had can-

cer, and I only gave him seven minutes of my time 
to talk? I felt selfish, rightfully so, and immediately 
brainstormed ways to make up for my subpar con-
solation. I would text him again tomorrow to see 
if he wanted to talk. I would be extra helpful and 
caring when I saw him and the rest of my family 
in two days. I would be a better son and become a 
model of good relations with my father. I lingered 

on my choices and regret and didn’t move on until 
I was temporarily satisfied with my plan of action.

We eventually parked the Jeep on the side of 

the trail, embarking on a walk through the woods. 
The golden light beamed through the trees, the 
lengthening shadows indicated the day was wind-
ing down. Several abandoned cars were rusting in 
the ground cover, immortalized in their image of 
vintage decay. The path stopped at a fast-flowing 
creek and upon arrival, we saw what we came 
for. Running through the dark, clear liquid were 
bright pink fish — salmon swimming upstream. 
Their color indicated that they were “zombie 
salmon,” a group on their lives’ final journey back 
upstream to lay eggs and plant the seeds of their 
next generation.

From my coworkers, I learned that these fish 

of the living dead instinctually returnto the places 
that they were born, and they will swim for eter-
nity to accomplish their life’s grand finale. Their 
scales turn pink as fat reserves are slowly depleted 
throughout their body, and the pigments that once 
colored their insides move to the outer layers of 
skin. The fish deteriorate physically and mentally, 
sacrificing their last days on Earth to the next gen-
eration.

Our group of coworkers-turned-friends waded 

into the fast-moving waters, watching the bright 
pink rockets whizz past our ankles. All of us under 
the age of thirty, in what is supposedly the prime 
of our existence, watched the fish go through 
the grueling, final stages of theirs. It was easy 
for us young Americans to question the salmon’s 
thought process: Why would one save the hardest 
journey of a lifetime for last? Backed up by images 
of midwest retirees migrating to Florida beaches, 
the end of our lives is a time when we should relax, 
take a final pause and settle down, taking in every 
last moment before they are gone.

A problem, however, with this school of 

thought is that many of us cannot choose when 
or what happens in our final days of existence. 
As nature’s instinct calls on salmon to return to 
their geographic origins, depleting and destroy-
ing them in the process, our bodies turn against 

us humans as well. No one, fish or person, chooses 
when or how these conditions will afflict us, and 
when or how they might end. The end of our lives, 
or the end of anything, is simply adapting to the 
constraints we are given.

Given that these were the last hours of daylight 

on our final night together in Alaska, we decided to 
spend it standing in the Jeep, dodging the branch-
es of overgrown brush, bright eyes and smiles 
reflecting glimmers of light from one to another. A 
once in a lifetime experience, one might say. In 24 
hours, we would head our separate ways, no lon-
ger united by the shared goal of caring for youth at 
a summer camp, but still tied together through the 
experience. Soon, we would all go home and pick 
up our former lives where they left off. I wondered 
if anything had shifted while I was gone, and if 
my family had changed over the few months they 
were without me in Michigan.

The social dynamic that I stepped off the 

plane to was largely the same as before I left. 
My mom and brother met me at the airport 
with hugs and questions, and there was nothing 
strange about the first lunch back in Michigan. 
But as the hours progressed during that first 
day back, I began to feel new undercurrents in 
my parents’ dialogue. A sense of urgency dust-
ed the top of their words. Stress and tension 
rippled from an invisible, yet still perceptible, 
elephant in the room. I worried what my next 

weeks at home would bring, still having almost 
a month until I moved away again for school. 
I worried for my parents and brother having 
to breathe heavy uncertainty for the following 
months, not knowing exactly what the next day 
would bring or the potential pains the future 
might hold. The cascade of doctor visits, medi-
cation and consolation created a landscape that 
felt foreign and strange.

But as new medical appointments began to 

write themselves on the family calendar, the air 
became lighter, and a newer sort of normal set in. 
My parents rolled with whatever news the doc-
tors had for my dad, and the nerves of having a 
family member diagnosed with cancer began to 
wear themselves off, relatively. Driving my dad to 
check-ups became part of a routine, rather than 
an unfamiliar journey. Receiving meals from 
friends was no longer a surprise, and Tupperware 
dinners were enjoyed without question. Taking 
inspiration from the Alaskan salmon, we just kept 
moving; swimming upstream to whatever life had 
in store for us.

Perhaps there is something naive about tak-

ing things as they come with little preparation. 
My call with my father represented a potential 
pitfall of this approach – talking with him longer 
instead of feeling rushed to the next activity may 
have eased my guilt. However, when navigating 
through the great unknown, especially in a world 
with an increasingly uncertain future, it might 
make more sense to only worry about what one 
sees and to keep moving forward to view the rest. 
There are only so many ways to avoid the inevi-
table anxiety that comes with waiting.

With the new semester just beginning, coupled 

with pandemic complications and being away 
from home, I know there will be moments when 
the future frightens and the present is not such a 
gift. In those times, I will wade into an Alaskan 
creek and watch the salmon, bright pink with 
ambition, wiggling their way through trials and 
tribulations, and admire them for their tenacity 
on their long journey home. Maybe this time, I’ll 
dive in and keep swimming with them.

S

aturday, Sept. 4 marked a monumental 
moment in Ann Arbor. For the first time 
in nearly two years, Michigan Stadium 

welcomed in students at full capacity for the 
first game of the Wolverines’ 2021 season. 
And though this wasn’t a homecoming 
game, the event centered largely on the idea 
of coming — or, more accurately, returning 
— home. A tumultuous virtual year left 
students scattered across the world in their 
childhood bedrooms. Tens of thousands of 
them reuniting in one cherished location 
at the same time was cause for celebration, 
even if dampened by lingering COVID-19 
concerns.

Returning as a recent graduate, however, 

added another layer of hesitation for me. It 
was, of course, incredible to be back in the 
Big House. It was like returning to my family 
home after my first semester of college and 
finding my bedroom intact. After feeling 
alienated from everything for a year, it 
reminded me how secure and certain I had 
felt in my place at the University of Michigan. 
But, like returning to a childhood bedroom, 
the experience was bittersweet. Everything 
may look the same, but some part of you 
knows this is not truly your home anymore, 
at least not in the same way it was before. It 
will naturally be taken over by others and 
used for something new.

Given the circumstances of the past 

year, however, the return was not merely 
bittersweet, but in some ways painful. 
Nostalgia for my college experience prior 
to the pandemic was partially replaced by 
heartbreak for the experiences I had lost to 
the pandemic. Game day in Ann Arbor was 
a reminder of everything that never was due 
to the pandemic; acquaintances that never 
became friends and memories that were 
never made.

Wrapped up in all of those conflicting 

feelings, game day above all reaffirmed to 
me that there is something about being in 
Ann Arbor — about being a U-M student — 
that can’t be replicated anywhere else. Being 
back at the Big House was the first time in a 
long time that I’d felt like a part of something 
bigger than myself. And it wasn’t just being 
in a crowd of 109,000 people. It was blending 
into a sea of maize and blue and chanting the 
same chants I had two years ago as if nothing 
had changed. It was almost a blessing of 
anonymity; in the crowd, I couldn’t be 

singled out as a recent graduate or a job-
seeker or a young adult in the transition 
from college to the real world. I could just be 
a Michigan Wolverine for a moment. And in 
that moment, I wanted to just be a Michigan 
Wolverine forever.

I’m certain I’m not alone in this feeling. 

Between 2008 and 2018, more than 96% 
of freshmen completed their first year 
successfully and returned to the University 
the following year. This makes Michigan tied 
for the 11th highest first-year retention rate 
nationally, which is well above the average of 
91.3% for all public schools in the Association 
of American Universities. Similarly, the 
University’s yield — the number of students 
enrolling compared to the number admitted 
— increased over 5% between 2014 and 2019. 
Clearly, there’s something about Michigan 
that motivates people to come here and stay 
here, more so than many other schools.
H

owever, the desire to make the 
Michigan experience last forever 
conflicts 
with 
the 
constant 

pressure to get it done as quickly as possible. 
Eighty percent of the University’s 2012 
first-year cohort graduated within four 
years, almost 20% greater than the average 
four-year graduation rate of AAU public 
universities. This is often touted as a good 
thing, and in many ways, it is. College is 
expensive and getting it done faster can 
save you a significant amount of money. And 
some students may desire an efficient college 
experience for social or personal reasons.

But financial and social pressures to 

finish as quickly as possible and get to the 
next step can detract from the experience 
of the four — or five or six — years spent on 
campus. It seems antithetical to how hard 
many of us worked and how excited many 
of us were to get here only to treat it as a 
stepping stone to what’s meant to come next. 
Perhaps this is becoming more noticeable 
due to the prominence of hustle culture 
among Gen Z at large; the desire to not only 
climb the career ladder but to exploit every 
possible ounce of our productive capability 
begins with our first steps on campus. But 
I think this culture goes back far beyond 
Gen Z. It’s somewhat unique to Michigan, 
an 
internalization 
of 
“the 
Michigan 

Difference” and “Leaders and the Best” and 
every other expectation foisted upon us by 

our attendance of this prestigious university 
— prestige we are frequently reminded of.

One especially oppressive part of this 

culture is the expectation that you should 
have everything figured out, a culture 
perpetuated 
by 
everyone 
around 
you 

seemingly having everything figured out. As 
early as August, LinkedIn connections are 
“thrilled to share” their internship plans for 
next summer or, even more daunting to those 
of us who feel behind, their return offers 
upon graduation. As a junior transfer, the 
gravity and immediacy of finding a junior 
year internship were impressed upon me 
before I even attended a class at Michigan. 

As difficult as these pressures can be, they 

do seem to be at least a common malaise, and 
in light of the pandemic, some students at 
Michigan are questioning the overemphasis 
on the junior year internship altogether. As 
much as it seems everyone else seems to 
have the future figured out, there are also 
reassurances that most people don’t and 
that everything will work out eventually. 
But getting to the end of my degree and 
feeling like everything expected of me hasn’t 
materialized can be a very lonely experience.

Upon 
commencement, 
I 
lost 
the 

camaraderie of collective struggle. I lost 
access to the social groups that carried 
me through college. In the days following 
graduation, I was removed from several 
group chats and listservs that had brought 
me together with others before the pandemic 
and kept me sane during it. Though I had 
been anticipating this separation, it still 
felt sudden. A few months later, as others 
celebrated a triumphant return to campus on 
the first day of classes, I spent that day in the 
same way I had spent the past year: working 
alone in my room. As much as I was thrilled 
for others to get back to campus, every joyful 
Instagram post and Snapchat story I saw 
made me long for a chance to return, to be 
invited back to the party.
G

raduation was also the moment that 
“real world” expectations came on 
in full force. I can no longer just say 

“I’m a student” when asked what I do. I had 
felt the pressure of knowing my future before 
graduation, but it became so much more 
visceral after losing the buffer of being in 
college. Whether it’s a doctor’s appointment 
or dinner with relatives, the question of 

“what’s next?” is asked less out of curiosity 
and more out of urgency. I’m no longer 
afforded understanding for my uncertainty; 
I’m 
presumed 
lost 
and 
directionless. 

Perhaps this is tied to the pressure to always 
think way ahead and to know exactly what’s 
coming next. After years of this culture, 
being uncertain after graduation and not 
quite sure of the next step is indicative of 
personal shortcomings and maybe even 
unworthiness of the Michigan pedigree.

The 
most 
interesting 
part 
of 
this 

internalized guilt is that I don’t believe 
my present state is the result of failure, 
but actually of choice. Truthfully: I need a 
minute. Maybe I’m just not ready to move 
on. I need a minute to linger in the space 
that was once mine before it becomes 
something else, just as my room at home 
was quickly converted into storage space. 
I need something between a victory lap 
and goodbye tour, or just a chance to finish 
writing this chapter in a way I’m at least 
somewhat satisfied with rather than having 
the page forcefully turned over. As much 
as I feel strange and even a bit unwelcome 
sticking around, I do believe there is value in 
lingering.

According 
to 
the 
University 
of 

Washington, it takes the average college 
graduate three to six months to find a job 
after graduation. As much as Michigan has 
constantly reinforced the importance of 
being different, of leading and being the best, 
I’m trying to be okay with being “average” in 
some measures, including this one.

As difficult as it can be following several 

years of an incessantly forward-looking 
culture, we need to allow ourselves and 
others space to linger and feel uncertain 
after graduation. Despite how the social 
environment at Michigan makes us feel, 
it’s normal to need time and to not have 
everything figured out even after you’ve 
received your diploma. This is especially true 
for the class of 2021: as much as you may feel 
urged to move on as if things were normal, 
what happened to our college experience 
frankly sucks. It’s more than okay if you 
need some extra time to wrap things up.

I have some ideas for what the next phase 

is, but for the moment, I’m not finished here. 
I’m going to linger in between Michigan and 
whatever’s next for right now. And besides, 
there’s always grad school.
