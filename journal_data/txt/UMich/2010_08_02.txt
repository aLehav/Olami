SEC alleges
University
donor fraud
Charges filed with court
against Samuel Wyly
for insider trading
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
A prominent University donor
is facing serious scrutiny from the
Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion after questions have surfaced
about the legality of several of his
investment practices and transac-
titans.
According to documents filed
with the Federal District Court in
Manhattan, University alum Samuel
Wyly and his brother, Charles, are
at the center of an SEC investiga-
titn. The SEC's complaint filed with
the court alleges insider trading and
securities fraud at companies where
the Wylys served on the boards of
directors.
Samuel Wyly is a notable figure
on the University's campus, having
donated $10 million in 1997 to help
build the Business School's Sam Wyly
Hall - a facility that cost approxi-
mately $20 million to construct. At
the time, the gift was the largest ever
given by a donor to the school for
facility construction.
The SEC is alleging that, through
an extensive financial network in the
Caymen Islands and Isle of Man, the
Wyly brothers were able to sell more
than $750 million in stocks from four
publicly traded corporations where
they sat on the companies' boards
of directors. Additionally, SEC offi-
cials say the two brothers engaged in

Yousef Rabhi sets
sights on County Board
of Commissioners
By DYLAN CINTI
Daily StaffReporter
A community activist since pre-
school, LSA senior Yousef Rabhi is
no stranger to door-to-door cam-
paigning. Having canvassed for
current city council members Mike
Anglin (D-Ward 5) and Steven
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) in heavily

student-populated neighborhoods,
Rabhi decided to throw his hat into
the ring this year.
The 21-year-old is vying for
a spot on the Washtenaw Coun-
ty Board of Commissioners - a
group whose present members
range in age from late 30s to early
60s. Rabhi, who is running as a
Democrat in the County's 11th dis-
trict, will face three challengers
in tomorrow's state primary elec-
tions.
Among his challengers are
Mike Fried, a former chief admin-
istrator for the Wayne County
Prosectuor's office, and LuAnne

Bullington, a former computer sdr-
vices worker, according to an arti-
cle in AnnArbor.com.
Despite the competition, Rabhi
said he's very optimistic about his
chances.
"All signs point toward victo-
ry," Rabhi said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily on Saturday.
Since announcing his candi-
dacy in January, Rabhi said he has
built up a considerable base of sup-
port among local politicians and
organizations.

On-campus polling to change

Non-residential
buildings become new
site of polling stations
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
As the August general primary
election approaches, Ann Arbor vot-
ers will seea change in their on-cam-
pus polling locations, as the residence
halls will no longer be used as voting
stations.
In an effort to maintain security,
polling stations previously located
in on-campus residential halls will
be shifted to non-residential campus
buildings. This move is the result of
conversations between University
and city officials, with the aid of Uni-
versity Housing and the Division of
Student Affairs.

Voters who previously reported
to Bursley Hall, Mary Markley Resi-
dence Hall, East Quadrangle and
South Quadrangle will now vote
instead at Pierpont Commons, Palmer
Commons, the Michigan League and
the Michigan Union, respectively.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said though the resi-
dence halls have not previously had
any security incidents during voting
days, housing officials have had con-
cerns about opening up the buildings
to the public, particularly as the vot-
ing process has changed to an elec-
tronic system.
Logan added that because parking
around the residential halls is difficult
to find, University officials felt they
could better uphold their commit-
ment to on-campus residents' safety
while making polling locations more
accessible to the public by pursuing
other on-campus locations.

With the summer primary elec-
tions, Logan said University officials
were also concerned about how sum-
mer groups staying in residential
halls, like South Quad and orientation
students staying in East Quad, would
be affected.
The Northwood Community Cen-
ter will remain a voting location
because it does not house any resi-
dents, Logan said.
Because the new replacement loca-
tions are still situated on campus,
Logan said he feels the University
and the city worked well together to
accommodate voters.
"We're pleased with the result, and
I believe the city is pleased with the
result too," Logan said.
Ann Arbor City Clerk Jacqueline
Beaudry said the public was made
aware of the change in locations, as
every registered voter in Washtenaw
County was sent a card informing

them about the change in locations
last June. During the primary elec-
tions, Beaudry said there will also
be signs on the doors of the previous
locations, which will direct the voters
where to go instead.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
Director of Community Relations,
.said the Government Relations Office
has been working to create a better
atmosphere for voters at polling loca-
tions in general. Their work includes
brainstorming methods to reduce the
time that voters will stand in line and
to make the locations more accessible.
Kosteva added that he thinks the
voters will be able to easily adapt to
the new on-campus polling locations.
"I think and hope that voters will
see very little difference outside of the
physical location and that they will
find it as equally accessible and easy
to cast their ballot at these locations,"
he said.

'U' researchers design robots for battlefield

Engineering team is
among finalists in
robotics competition
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Some soldiers may soon be taken
out of harm's way on the battlefield
as robots designed by a University
research team could explore and per-,
form reconnaissance in hostile ter-
rain.
Edwin Olson, assistant professor
of electrical engineering and com-
puter sciences, and his team have
been selected as finalists in the 2010
Multi Autonomous Ground-Robotic
International Challenge (MAGIC)
- a competition jointly sponsored
by the United States Department of
Defense and the Australian Depart-
ment of Defense Science and Tech-
nology Organization.
"The goal of MAGIC is to foster
technologies that will allow robots
to autonomously help in war zones.
So things like doing reconnaissance
missions and exploration and finding
bad guys and identifying bombs and
things like that," Olson said.
The competition was originally
designed to gather research propos-

als worldwide to develop robotic sys-
tems for use in military operations
and emergency situations, according
to a University press release.
Olson said the competition push-
es for robots to be made more useful
in the battlefield and for single opera-
tors to control multiple robots rather
than a team of operators maneuver-
ing a single machine.
The first round of the competition
began in November last year when
the University competed against 23
college- and corporate-based teams,
according to the release. Teams were
required to submit a film and a writ-
ten report detailing their plans along
with preliminary results.
"Between that phase and this
most recent June ... we built a team
of five robots that could autono-
mously go through an environment
and explore. There was some human
intervention involved in terms of
guiding those robots, but the robots
really did do a lot on their own,"
Olson said.
The ten teams initially select-
ed for funding had each received
a $50,000 grant to support their
research costs. However, earlier in
the month, the competition orga-
nizers visited each of the participat-
ing teams to observe their robots in
action and selected the University to

be among six finalists to receive an
additional $50,000 in grant funding.
Olson said the six teams will
be going to Australia in November
for the final round of competitions,
which will award $750,000 for the
first place team, $250,000 for the
runner-up group and $100,000 for
the third place team.
Aside from the funding that the
University will receive, the competi-
tion is also significant for Olson on a
personal level.
Olson, who said the competition
aligned with a lot of his research
goals, added that developing equip-
ment for the military was not origi-
nally part of his research agenda.
"It's not a goal of mine to devel-
op something for the military, but
I think robotics technology for the
military has a lot of good things
going for it," he said. "For one thing,
by putting robots out there, we take
our troops out of harm's way. SoI see
it fundamentally as a lifesaving tech-
nology."
Olson said the research for this
competition is different from his past
projects given that his team, which
includes five graduate students and
one undergraduate student, is faced
with developing a team of robots as
opposed to a single robot.
"From a research perspective,

working with a team of robots pres-
ents a lot of interesting challenges,"
Olson said. "We have to divide up that.
work that has to get done between
multiple robots and algorithmically
that's a difficult problem."
Olson said he and his team have
been working diligently for the past
year and will continue to do so as the
competition nears its end, adding
that they are aiming for the top prize.
"We want to show off that Michi-
gan is an emerging robotics power-
house," he said. "And I think that's
actually true, so we want the world
to know ... that Michigan is going to
be the leader in robotics."

'U' study: women base self-worth in weight

Among other races,
white women who are
preoccupied with body
weight seek thinness
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StffReporter
A University study suggests that
white women who base their self-
worth on body weight experience a
significant drive toward thinness,
despite having healthy body mass
indices. Women of other races share
a similar, though less significant, con-
nection between self-worth and body
weight, according to the study.
Led by Natalie Cole, a Ph.D. can-
didate in women's studies and psy-
chology, the study, published in June,
consisted of two surveys in which
college-aged women were asked to
declare their ethnic identity and
answer questions regarding the con-
nection between their self-worth and
body weight.
Cole said the goal of the surveys,



which were conducted in the early
years of the past decade, was to note
any differences in body satisfaction
between different ethnic groups. The
study also examined what factors, if
any, led women to engage in dieting
behaviors.
Though Cole said she expected
white women to have the highest drive
for thinness, she was surprised to
find that white women had that drive
even as they claimed they had overall
healthy body weight and satisfaction
with their appearance.
Cole added it was clear that after
answering whether or not their body
satisfaction would go up or down
if they lost 10 pounds, participants
showed that their self-worth was
linked to being thin.
This finding was significant, Cole
said, to her and the co-authors of the
study - Elizabeth Cole, an associ-
ate professor in women's studies, and
Monique Ward, an associate professor
of psychology - because it conflicts
with previous notions about women
who choose to engage in dieting
behaviors.
"We thought that was particularly


important because it really speaks to
this idea that how much you weigh is
related to how you feel about your-
self overall and that's happening for
white women regardless of (whether)
they're satisfied with their appear-
ance or if they're of normal weight,"
Cole said.
Though the study did not exam-
ine why white women placed a high
importance on weight, Cole said she
believes it is due to the images of thin
women that are perpetuated in the
media.
"I think that women see those objec-
tified images and really identify with
that and think that in order to have
value, in order to be seen as sexy, you
need to looka certain ways," she said.
Because many of the images are
white women, Cole said some people
do not think that other ethnic groups
experience the same drive for thin-
ness.
Though African American women
ranked the lowest for the drive for
thinness and basing self-worth to their
weight, Cole said they also found that
some of the African American par-
ticipants did base their self-worth on


weight and were susceptible to dieting
behaviors.
Findings in the study also indicated
that though Asian American women
had the lowest BMI average, they also
had low satisfaction with their body
appearance.
Cole said she hopes these findings
can aid educators and counselors who
are working with women onbody and
self-esteem.
"One of our hopes for what will hap-
pen with this research is that it will
help inform people who are working
with African American women and
Asian American women to really edu-
cate them more about what's going on
with their body image and eating hab-
its, so that they can really be in tune
with that group," she said.
Though Cole said she is now focused
on the interaction between older
women and body image, she said she
and her colleagues are still particu-
larly interested in under-represented
groups.
"We're really interested in peo-
ple whose experiences haven't been
explored as much in the literature,"
she said.

Vote Hieftje, Kailasapathy, Teall, Hohnke
Candidates for city government promise changes to increase student involvement in city politics
T here's no hiding Ann Arbor's overwhelmingly blue hue when it comes to politics. With Republicans rarely standing a chance
in the general election, the August primary among Democrats tends to be the deciding ballot in city elections. That makes it
especially important for students to show up to vote on Tuesday, when contests will be decided for the mayor as well as City
Council seats for Wards 1, 4 and 5.

Undoubtedly the most encouraging factor of this year's elec-
tion was the consensus among most candidates that the prima-
ry date should be changed. While many blamed the restrictions
stipulated by state law, there appeared to be a sincere willing-
ness to work with state-level officials to move the date to a
time when students can participate. What remains to be seen
is whether or not this election year enthusiasm translates into
action, lest this continue to be an empty campaign promise.
With a decade under his belt at the helm of Ann Arbor's city
government, incumbent John Hieftje has plenty to boast about.
During a time when most other municipal governments face
crippling cuts to vital public services and tax hikes, Hieftje has
done a respectable job as the steward of Ann Arbor's finances.
The city has minimized layoffs and cutbacks while continuing
to embark on impressive "green" initiatives, promote a dense,
vibrant urban core and enhance mass transit.
Hieftje will face off against challenger Patricia Lesko, CEO
of Part-Time Press and the formerly anonymous voice behind
the blog A2Politico. With a level of rhetoric not typical to Ann
Arbor politics, Lesko venomously criticized Hieftje's tenure as
a lot of talk and "green-wash" without real results. She argues
passionately for the direct inclusion of student voices in city
politics and opposes the ward system, as well as condemns the
current administration for cuts in public services.
Hieftje has, by most measures, been a positive force for Ann
Arbor. Lesko seems to be much more apt as a critic than as a
candidate to lead Ann Arbor. Her fiery campaign rhetoric has
featured a list of statistics and facts that have turned out to be
outright false or misleading, such as stating that the city gov-
ernment's Chief Financial Officer Roger Fraser had received a
35 percent pay raise since he started (it's actually 16 percent)
and that Stadium Bridge collapsed, according to AnnArbor.
com. And while Hieftje could benefit from incorporating some
of Lesko's emphasis on engaging students more directly with
city politics, he has proven himself able the manager and leader
Ann Arbor needs. The Daily endorses John Hieftje for mayor.
In Ward 1, incumbent Sandi Smith faces a formidable chal-

lenger in Sri Lankan-born Sumi Kailasapathy. Smith has an
impressive legacy on city council protecting human services,
supporting affordable housing and promoting downtown
development. She led initiatives to double the occupancy of the
emergency shelter system last winter, supported an expansion
in the city's recycling program and created the Energy Audit
and Rehabilitation Grant Program, which incentivizes down-
town businesses to invest in energy efficiency.
But Sumi Kailasapathy also has a remarkable record in
human rights, most notably as a leading student organizer at the
University of Jaffna during the 1980's, where she co-founded
a women's shelter for victims of the military's sexual violence
and fought for human rights. Now a certified public accoun-
tant, Kailasapathy, more than any other challenger this year,
demonstrates an incredibly strong grasp of the city's finances
and the skeptical voice the Council needs to keep its spending
in check, ask the right questions and ensure that all available
options are explored.
While Smith's record on human services is indeed com-
mendable, Kailasapathy too shares this passion for helping
society's less fortunate members. More importantly, she dem-
onstrates an immense knowledge of the issues at play in this
election, including the city's complex financial picture. She
argues enthusiastically - and rightfully - for the need for
independent voices on the Council. The Daily endorses Sumi
Kailasapathy for City Council in Ward 1.
In Ward 4, incumbent Margie Teall is running against Jack
Eaton. Teall has an impressive and lengthy resume as a mem-
ber of City Council since 2002. She has been a leader in sup-
porting environmentalism in both city government and Ann
Arbor at large. Most importantly, she has found innovative
funding solutions for building projects that have minimized
their impact on the budget. And like most other candidates,
she expressed an eagerness to move the primary date to a time
when students can participate.
Challenger Jack Eaton, on the other hand, criticizes the city's
cuts to public services and also promises to work directly with

student groups to move the primary date. As a former Univer-
sity student, he claims he understands the issues students face
as unique residents of Ann Arbor. He also argues that he will
make the Council more transparent, citing incidents this year
in which council members were found to be regularly trading
e-mails during meetings with the public.
Yet while his vision for Ann Arbor is impressive, his plans
for making it a reality are rather vague. In contrast, his oppo-
nent has extensive experience in city government and the deep,
specific knowledge necessary to find creative solutions to the
problems facing the city. The Daily endorses Margie Teall for
City Council in Ward 4.
In Ward 5, incumbent Carsten Hohnke is pitted against
Lou Glorie. Hohnke can point to a solid record during his
two years on the Council, when he sat on the Greenbelt Advi-
sory Commission, passed legislation that expanded the city's
recycling program and supported policies restricting subur-
ban sprawl. He has worked with students on lighting issues
and shows a genuine desire to work more closely with them
in the future, including an expressed interest in collaborating
to engage state legislators on finding a primary date during
the school year.
Like most challengers this year, Glorie is campaigning
on what she sees as the need to reprioritize the city finances
toward public services and restore fiscal responsibility. On her
website, she states that if some in the city government "believe
we have too many police and firefighters, then they should
explain why, and we should discuss it" and that she "doesn't
see why the city would consider reducing the number of these
employees." Glorie similarly promotes repairing the city's leaky
water system and crumbling roads.
Hohnke has the benefit of being able to point to his accom-
plishments as a councilmember, whereas Glorie must run on
the quality of her ideas and plans for change. Unfortunately,
these are both lacking in details and paint a picture of Ann
Arbor that oversimplifies the challenges it faces. The Daily
endorses Carsten Hohnke for City Council in Ward 5.

My own identity

ELAINE MORTON

E-MAIL ELAINEAT EMORT @UMICH.EDU.

Last week, many American
Jews, myself included, breathed
a sigh of relief - for the moment,
at least - when the Israeli Knes-
set declined to vote on a bill that
could give Israel's Orthodox Rab-
binate the authority to validate or
invalidate conversions performed
in the country. As the Knesset
breaks for its summer recess, the
bill will thankfully remain tabled
for'at least three months (or four
to six depending on who you ask).
Since I'm a fairly secular Jew,
it might seem odd to some that I
would care about abillthat appears
to deal with strictly religious mat-
ters. However, debate over this
legislation revolves around the
question of what it means to be
Jewish, a question that isn't nec-
essarily about religion. Under-
standing American objections
to the legislation first requires
understanding a largely secular
American Jewish character that
emphasizes Jewish pluralism.
There's an episode of the televi-
sion series "Entourage" in which
Ari, the Jewish agent, is scolded
by his wife for ducking out of
High Holiday services to make a
business call. It's the most impor-
tant Jewish holiday, she tells him,
and he's setting a bad example for
their children. While there are
many who would likely agree with
Ari's wife, I actually disagree. In
this country, there's nothing more
* Jewish than absentmindedly
attending High Holiday services
while continuing to fret about the
rest of your busy life.
The "Entourage" scenario
serves as an example of a larger
phenomenon. American Jews
form strong communities. that
appear to revolve around more
than religion. According to the
2008 Pew Forum U.S. Religious
Landscape Survey, on average,
American Jews are less likely than
American Christians to believe in
God or attend services, but we join
and participate in congregations
at similar rates.
The ideaof a Jewish community
united by non-religious values can
be perplexing. Jews can (and will)
debate what it means to be Jew-
ish for an eternity. Religion aside,
there are many cultural traits that
take on a distinctly Jewish-Amer-
ican character. We are commit-
ted to Tikkun Olam, the healing
of the world, but at the same time
possess an overarching sense of.

sarcasm reminiscent of Woody
Allen or Jerry Seinfeld. And of
course, as Harvard Law profes-
sor Alan Dershowitz states, our
Jewish identities are "energized"
by anti-Semitism and a history of
religious persecution.
Because our community seems
to be united by much more than
religion, religious pluralism with-
in American Judaism is generally
accepted, often even celebrated.
There certainly are very religious
Jews who look down on those
who don't practice and see rituals
as central to the Jewish identity.
But an Orthodox friend of mine
recently expressed the opposite
opinion: "It doesn't bother me
when Jews aren't religious. What
bothers me is when Jews who
don't practice don't call them-
selves Jewish."
This sentiment that Jewish
pluralism is a positive force is not
completely absent from Israel,
where, according to the Israel
Democracy Institute, roughly 51
percent of the population is "secu-
lar." The difference is that Israel
has a prominent Orthodox lead-
ership that sees other forms of
Judaism as illegitimate, whereas
secular Judaism is viewed as
increasingly mainstream in the
United States.
Which brings me back to the
conversion bill. The politics sur-
rounding the bill are messy, but
the focal point for criticism is
that the bill gives Israel's Ortho-
dox Rabbis more authority to
determine who is Jewish by state
definition. While it's unclear what
the exact practical effects of the
legislation might be, it has the
potential to affect whether Jew-
ish converts are allowed to immi-
grate to Israel under the Law tof
Return. Regardless, if the bill is
passed, it will give more legiti-
macy to a leadership that believes
un-Orthodox Jews in the U.S. are
not really Jewish.
There are a few outcomes that
I and other American Jews can
hope for regarding this bill. One
is that it's never passed. Another
possibility is that the most con-
troversial provisions will be
watered down or removed during
the recess. But if the bill does get
passed in its current form, it will

Ann Arbor loves to boast about
its diversity. It's home to the
University and a variety of
colorful char-
acters that give
the city a unique
atmosphere. But
that diversity
isn't reflected in
the Ann Arbor
City Council. Ann
Arbor residents
are so ardently RACHEL
Democratic that VAN GILDER
they have over-
looked the value
that a conservative candidate could
have. Both Democrats and Republi-
cans have something to offer in the
debate regarding city issues. Ann
Arbor voters shouldn't feel bound
to the Democratic Party when
choosing City Council representa-
tives. Instead, candidates should be
judged on their understanding of the
city's varied set of needs- and that
includes the needs of students.
The Aug. 3 party primary election
is almost certain to determine the
outcome of November's final ballot
because there won't be a Republi-
can contender in most wards. And
since the Ann Arbor population is
so strongly Democratic, it's almost
certain any Republican candidates
won't be able to steal the general
election anyway. Incumbent John
Hieftje, who has been Ann Arbor's
mayor since 2000, faces competi-
tion for the Democratic nomination
for mayor this year from political
blogger Patricia Lesko. Meanwhile,
the campaign for the Democratic
nomination for City Council seats in
Wards 1, 4 and 5 are also contested.
Only Ward 5 has a candidate for
the Republican nomination: John
Floyd, who also ran for Ward 5's
City Council seat in 2008.
It's no surprise that infamously lib-
eral Ann Arbor has a hard time drum-
ming up conservative candidates.
Voters often choose to vote for all the
candidates of one party - sometimes

as high as 60 percent of general elec-
tion voters in Michigan, according to
a 2002 reportby the Mackinac Center
for Public Policy, a Michigan-based
nonpartisan research institute. Peo-
ple tend to feel a loyalty to their party
of choice, and many are skeptical that
a candidate from the opposing party
could offer anything of value to any
governmental debate.
But there's no reason for Demo-
crats to stick stolidly to party lines
or for conservatives to give up on
Ann Arbor. In an election this size,
the most significant concern isn't
whether a candidate is red or blue.
City Council isn't the U.S. Congress.
The fate of abortion or health care
isn't going to be decided by local gov-
ernments. City Council deals with
infrastructure issues (roads, water,
etc.), urban planning (like the much-
discussed Ann Arbor Discovering
Downtown initiative) and the cre-
ationof ordinances.
Republicans and Democrats alike
can agree that the East Stadium
Blvd. Bridge is in desperate need of
repair. And though the potential ban
on porch couches that was put back
into the spotlight after this April's
rash of suspicious fires is conten-
tious, it's not really a deliberation
based on a moral debate between
conservatives and liberals.
Just because a candidate shares
your political perspectives doesn't
make them a good candidate. The
case in point for me is John Floyd. I
met Floyd in 2008 when he made his
first bid for a Ward 5 council seat. To
me, Floyd isn't right for Ann Arbor,
even though he and I share many
political opinions. For example, Floyd
didn't seem to recognize the impor-
tance ofthe University or its students.
He also didn't support more and
denser housing downtown, which
students need.
But I do agree with Floyd that
Ann Arbor needs some fresh blood
and diversity of opinion on the City
Council. There are a few debates that
would benefit from a Republican

voice, and having a variety of opin-
ions is never a bad thing. The city's
property taxes, for example, seem
excessively high to me. High prop-
erty taxes contribute to the already
expensive housing market in Ann
Arbor - and students are directly
affected by housing concerns. A
cut on those taxes would make rent
significantly cheaper by decreasing
property owners' costs.
City Council
should include
conservatives too.
And while a Republican might be
more likely to push for lower taxes,
the concern isn't exclusively ideo-
logical for me. Instead, it's important
to the demographic that I belong to:
University students. This is a demo-
graphic that often gets ignored in city
elections because of students' lack of
interest and because many students
aren't in Ann Arbor for the primary.
But candidates shouldn't count stu-
dents out because, in this race, every
vote really does count. Last summer,
City Councilman Stephen Kunsel-
man beat out incumbent Leigh Gre-
den in the Democratic primary by
only six votes. Candidates shouldn't
count out the importance of any
demographic, so they must be pre-
pared to go to work on the issues that
concern students.
The City Council should consider
the needs of all its constituents, and
that means taking an approach to
government that isn't defined by
party affiliations. A more diverse
council made up of both liberals and
conservatives would advocate for a
diverse population.

The unsung heroes of the pine

7

People always debate the high-
est-pressure position on
sports team. Most sports have
a more or less con-
sensus answer - for
hockey, the goalie;
for football, the
quarterback; for
volleyball, the set-
ter. But the answer
is actually the same
for all sports - it's COURTNEY
the benchwarmer. FLETCHER
There are no arti-
cles written about them, no glory, no
recognition and, most of the time, fans
don't even know who they are. But
what the outside world fails to recog-
nize is that without these crucial play-
ers, no team could be successful.
I found myself in this undesirable
position during my freshman year.
I had been a starter on every team I
had ever played since I was 13. Going
from a position of glory to a position

of anonymity was one of the hard-
est things I went through. It's really
easy to get excited about practice and
working hard when you see games
on the weekend as the reward. But
as a benchwarmer, you go to practice
every day, work just as hard and put
forth the same effort as your team-
mates, and your reward is to watch.
And then, on top of watching, you
have to cheer on your teammates, be
supportive and then put on a happy
face. To a newly benched player, this
appears to be a lackluster reward for
your hard work.
The mental aspect of being a
benchwarmer is definitely the hard-
est part of the position. Every person
on the team has the ability to go to
practice and give it their all, day in
and day out. But for a benchwarmer,
it's about both doing that every week
and coming up short week after week.
Mentally, you have to tell yourselfthat,
you're preparing to play against some

of the best competition in the nation.
But, as each week goes by, the chances
of that happeningbecome smaller and
smaller. When the game does come
around, you can't check out and not
pay attention. You have to be men-
tally invested in the match and know
what's going on in case your name is
actually called.
Playing in a game actually releas-
es a lot of mental stress and anxiety
built up during practice. But if you
don't get to play, you experience the
same stress and anxiety without the
release and satisfaction that you con-
tributed to the win or loss.
Whatanyplayeronateammustreal-
ize - starter or benchwarmer - is that
every single player is crucial to ateam's
success. Competition in practice is one
of the driving forces behind players
improving. It's easy to be complacent
when you have a solid lock on your
starting spot. But if there's another
player nipping at their heels, that com-

placency turns into competition and a
drive to perform at your best. The real
source of a team's overall improvement
during practice comes from the people
who don't play at all. The non-starting
players must raise their own level of
play and challenge starters. The higher
the level of competition is in the gym,
the more successful the team is going
to be duringactual games.
People always talk about those who
graduated and who will fill their role.
But it's the ones people don't talk about
that may actually carry a bigger role.
Cassie Petoskey was the volleyball
team's leader among non-starters this
past year. Cassie set the standard for
contributing even while not playing.
Every time we competed, her goal was
not to challenge the other side, but to
beat them - and badly. Cassie knew
she was notgoing to see a lot of playing
time, but her integrity and character
held a lot of other players from going
down a path of self-pity. She united

the benchwarmers without separating
them from the team. That takes a spe-
cial kind of person, and that is going to
be hard to replace this upcoming year.
Benchwarmers
play a crucial role
in team success.
Nobody plays a sport so that they
can practice - they practice so they
can play. Unfortunately, it doesn't
always work out that way. There will
always be starters and benchwarm-
ers. But it's the mentality, attitude and
work ethic of the benchwarmers that
make the good teams great.

The real environmental disaster

ast week, congressional
leaders gave up on stopping
climate change for the fors-
eeable future.
The U.S. Con-
gress dropped all
forms of a cap on
carbon emissions
from its pending
energy bill.
In a nasty
irony that would NICHOLAS
find itself at home CLIFT
on a bad reality
show, around the
time Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (D-Nev.) was explaining that
he didn't have the votes for a carbon
cap, the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration was releas-
ing its annual State of the Climate
Report. In the report, more than 300
scientists in 48 countries confirmed
that the last decade was the warmest
on record, continuing a long-standing
upward trend in global temperature.
Like NASA, the National Academy
of Sciences, the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science
and the United States Global Change
Research Program, NOAA again

reminded us how startlingly real cli-
mate change is.
I've been campaigning for America
to fight global warming for a while. It
was the hope of finally taking steps to
combat climate change that had me so
passionate about voting for President
Barack Obama in 2008. Accordingly,
the loss of congressional support for
combating climate change is tough
for me to swallow. But my sense of
annoyance over last week's events
must be nothing like the sense of
annoyance felt by scientists who have
studied the climate their entire life
yet continue to be ignored.
Among other obstacles for scien-
tists, you may remember "Climat-
egate." E-mails hacked from a server
at the University of East Anglia were
spun by some as proof of a conspiracy
among scientists to dupe the public
on global warming. Around the same
time, the findings of the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change
came under fire for a prediction
about glacial melting that proved to
be misinformed.
Though the scientists at East
Anglia and the IPCC have since been
exonerated by multiple independent

investigations, the stories fueled an
already thick atmosphere of misin-
formation. The American people are
famous for their fierce independence
- namely, their tendency to distrust
authority and those who call them-
selves "experts." For scientists every-
where, these "scandals" shook the
already shaky confidence the public
has in the scientific establishment.
The $175 million dollars spent on lob-
bying by the oil and gas industries last
year alone, as reported by OpenSe-
crets.org, didn't help the atmosphere
of misinformation either.
When the crisis of public faith was
near its worst, Natalia Andronova,
an IPCC contributor and climate
researcher in the University's Depart-
ment of Atmospheric, Oceanic and
Space Sciences, expressed to me her
imperturbable faith in the ability of
the general public to ultimately get
things right. "The public really wants
to know what is right, what is wrong,"
she assured me. She felt confident
that, given accurate information,
Americans would make wise deci-
sions concerning the climate.
But while I respect Andronova's
confidence in the public, I'm both-

ered by the fact that the public does
not reciprocate her confidence. The
situation is so ridiculous it's almost
comical: Dr. Andronova has dedicat-
ed her career to studying the climate.
As I sat across from her in her office,
she told me that there is consen-
sus among climate researchers that
humans are affecting the climate.
She wasn't deceptive. She was simply
a kind lady trying to get a skeptical
public to believe her. I trust her judg-
ment and the judgment of thousands
of other climate scientists across the
world. Yet many non-scientists insist
they know better, usually because it
feels momentarily cold outside.
It's worth acknowledging that,
while Harry Reid's new bill doesn't
have carbon caps, it does have some
provisions for encouraging energy
efficiency, and it changes federal
regulation of offshore drilling. It's
also an epic example of winning the
battle but losing the war. We think
the problem which warrants action is
a leak. We call it the worst environ-
mental disaster in our nation's his-
tory. Meanwhile, the populations of
phytoplankton, microscopic plants at
the very base of all life in the oceans,

are down 40 percent - not from
leaked oil, but from global warming.
It's the result of a slow population
drop that scientists started seeing 50
years ago.
Climate change is
too dangerous for
Congress to ignore.
And it's an ominous sign of what's
to come. If phytoplankton goes,
ocean life collapses.
Chastising BP and plugging the oil
leak are all well and good. But now is
not the time for shortsightedness in
Congress. In addressingthe immediate
problem of the oil spill, we're treating a
small symptom of using fossil fuels for
energy. Meanwhile, an unimaginably
more serious disaster closes in - one
that will be far more costly to our soci-
ety and planet if left unchecked.

of Conan Smith, a current member
of the Washtenaw County Board of

But according to Rabhi, his great-

"face time" - going door-to-door

just knocking on their doors," Rabhi
said. "It's the way you make politics
and democracy accessible. I want to
engage the people in the democratic
process."
Rabhi said he began going door-to-
door in late April, which enabled him
to reach more houses than if he had
started closer to the primary. Start-
ing early was important, he said, in
a district of about 25,000 registered
voters.
"At the beginning a lot of people
were telling me, 'You're the first
county commissioner candidate
that's ever knocked on my door,' "
Rabhi said.
Rabhi said his campaign efforts
have only intensified since April.

munity, including South Quadrangle,
West Quadrangle and predominantly
student-filled neighborhoods around
Oakland Avenue and Fifth Avenue.
Rabhi said he makes a point of hit-
ting student-heavy areas even though
the student population deflates over
the summer.
"I think it's important to engage
all the voters, not just the people who
are usual voters," he said. "I don't
think it's a waste of time."
Still campaigning in the days lead-
ing up to the primary election, Rabhi
left flyers on Saturday afternoon for
residences on Fifth Avenue and Wil-
liam Street, making notes to himself
to return later to houses in which no
one answered his knocks.
Rabhi did get the chance for direct
interaction and the opportunity to
tions in question were anything other
than legal and fully appropriate,"
said William Brewer, III, a partner at
Bickel & Brewer - the firm represent-
ing the Wylys. "It will come as little
surprise to those who know them that
the Wylys intend to vigorously defend
themselves ... and expect to be fully
vindicated."
In an e-mail interview with The
Michigan Daily, University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham said it's
unfortunate the Wyly brothers are
currently experiencing such hard-
ships.
"Mr. Wyly is a longtime support-
er of the University," Cunningham
wr"te in her e-mail. "We're sorry to
hear he is facing these difficult cir-
cumstances."
The charges come after nearly two
decades of investigations into the Wyly
brothers' investment practices, which
led to a Senate investigation in 2006.
At the culmination of the investigation,
the Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, which at the time
included ranking minority member
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), released
a report highlighting the Wyly broth-
ers' investment practices as one of six
elaborate abuses of tax laws.
At the time, Jerry May, the Univer-
sity's vice president for development,
said Wyly was innocent until proven
guilty.
"Sam Wyly is a highly reputable
and successful business person," May
said in an interview with the Daily at
the time. "He has done a lot for a lot of
organizations and people."
A spokesperson at the Business
School echoed May's comments at the
time, saying the Senate's investiga-
tions were unlikely to impact Wyly's
relationship with the Business School.
Though comment on the Univer-
sity's process for screening donors was
not immediately available last week-
end, the University's past actions sug-
gest the University may continue to
stand by Wyly by leaving his name on

answer questions about his platform at
some houses along his campaign path.
At the South Division home of
Dylan Manna - a PhD candidate in
physics at the University - Rabhi
launched into a conversation about
important issues facing the county.
Manna asked Rabhi how he stood
out from his opponents.
"What I'm bringing to the table is
energy and enthusiasm to get the job
done," Rabhi replied. He then began
talking about his plans to continue
funding vital human services while
encouraging sustainability.
"Sustainability - environmental,
economic and social. That's what

By the end of their brief conversa-
tion, Manna said he had confidence
in Rabhi's campaign.

"I like the fact that you're young
and enthusiastic;" Manna said.
"You've got my vote."
Rabhi said he doesn't want his age
to be a factor in the race, adding that
when he first considered running, he
thought his age would work against
him.
"I don't like to use age to distin-
guish myself from my opponents," he
said. "When I started, I was afraid of
the fact that I was a student. I was
afraid that people would not accept
that."
After comments like Manna's,
though, Rabhi said he's begun to
realize that his age might actually
work in his favor.
"I've realized that what I'm bring-
ing to the table is new and different,"
he said. "But that's my strength."

Lee Bollinger stood by University alum
and donor Alfred Taubman, who was
found guilty of price-fixing - a convic-
tion that landed Taubman a one-year

Bollinger said he would not change

Taubman's name should have been

"I don't think that sets a wonderful

Vegging out @burger

A2's newest burger
joint is forbidden fruit
for vegetarians
By EMMA JESZKE
Managing Arts Editor
Veggies ... beware.
East Liberty Street's latest
lovechild, @burger, is kind of like the
Noodles & Co. of burgers - order at
the counter, deliver to the table, no
tipping, etc. - but the comparison
stops there. With a menu extremely
inaccessible to the iron-deprived, you
wouldn't even know that any of its
beef-on-bacon burgers could be made
vegetarian.
They can, though - but in truth,
that's nothing to write home about.
Unless, of course, you're writing
home to tell your loved ones good-
bye, because there's no way you'll live
through the incessant stomach pain
induced by @burger's poor excuse for
a veggie burger. (But, then again, will-
ingly eating at a restaurant opened by
former owners of Big Boy is probably
asking for it.)
Cooks at @burger should make
sure all vegetarian patties are kept
away from the sizzling cow juice on
the grill - even small amounts of
unfamiliar meat product ina vegetar-
ian's body can throw their system out
of whack for days.
Aside from the actual eating part,
though, @burger isn't so bad. Despite
a serious identity crisis in the vibe
of the restaurant - it's struggling
between being a pseudo-sports bar
with a 4:1 ratio of plasma TVs to walls
and another hipster hangout with
minimalist design and modern, angu-

lar furniture - the overall @burger
dining experience is rather pleasant.
The waitstaff is extremely attentive
and friendly and the men in charge
are accessible and eager for feedback.
The place is Stepford-wife clean, and
they cook their fresh potato chips in
non-hydrogenated oil.
If @burger is doing anything, it's
standing up against traditional A2
burger culture: You don't leave feel-
ing like you need to take a shower and
don't need to undergo harassment for
your meat-free treat.

Unfortunately, though, these
minor details don't have a prayer of
winning over your average veg-head.
With places like Seva (portabella and
tempeh options) and Sava's (black
bean and lentil options) just a spit
away, an over-processed Morning-
star patty on a fancy bun isn't enough
to cajole the veggie masses to dine
with @burger.
Needless to say, @burger is going to
have to make some adjustments if it is
aiming to please the soy-hugging hip-
pie crowd of the Arbs.

GETTING TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER ...

KIDS
From Page 9
anearly'90s film addressingthe iden-
tity crises of marriage dissolution.
There's something decidedly raw
and familiar about the emotions
revealed toward the second half of
the film, with the very real threat of
neglect and divorce looming in the
distance. In this way, "Kids" becomes
much more relatable than your typi-
cal quirky-family comedy. The film
doesn't scream about its sexuality - it
simplytakes it as fact. The film indus-
try has been slow to embrace the
concept of a nuclear family beyond
the whole heterosexual picket fence
thing, so it's refreshing that "Kids"
can be so daring yet conventional at
the same time.
Yet herein may lie the problem.
While the script is stunning, tossing
off well-thrusted barbs like a skilled
javelin thrower, it can get a bit sketch-
oriented and comedic. Yet once trag-
edy hits the family, something goes a
little off - it's like the mood doesn't
know where it wants to be. The best
genre to place "Kids" in would prob-
ably be tragicomedy, but Cholodenko
has a problem with transitioning
from the tragic to the comic. There
are some really huge misfortunes
that befall this close-knit family, but

This time around, Williams's voice

He's distinctively less morose, too.

able for non-vegetarians. Each of the
aspiring franchise's eight "soon to be
famous" burger basics can be made
with patties of beef, chicken or veg-
etables (although the veggie option is
hard to locate on the menu).
The beef-pattied Southwest Jack
burger oozed with enough homemade
guacamole to satisfy the entire Ari-

was satisfyingly melted into the meat.
The beef itself was tolerable if some-

sauce bottles on the tables sort of made
up for that.

Other burger options include the
classy basil-mozzarella-pesto-tomato
Caprese, the intriguing Savory Garlic
Mushroom and Swiss and the Trash
Can - a veritable festival of ingredi-
ents including fried egg and banana
peppers.
@burger's meat is nothing spe-
cial - what gives the joint hope is the
creative eclecticism of its menu and
its cook staff's willingness to change.
With a bit more direction, @burger

it takes the audience a little time to

cycle three runner-up YaYa Dacosta

Although several of its turns might

drawn, then King shows his sun-
nier, extroverted side. Instead of
lamenting the goth scene and his@
lack of future prospects like in pre-
vious records - "Got no car, got no
money" - Williams takes on a more
blatantly sarcastic tone, even during
his favorite, oft-mentioned topic of
self-reproach.
On"GreenEyes," (essentially alove
ballad, in the style of Wavves, any-
way) Williams claims that all of his
friends hate his guts. He's obviously
kidding, as the sentiment is accompa-
nied by an extremelyup-tempo guitar
riff and drum beats. Introspection is
definitely not a key trait of Williams,
who seems to have a predilection for
taking it easy (via copious 420 refer-
ences, Garfield memorabilia, et al).
This is not to say that everything
about Wavves has changed. Wil-
liams's impishness remains inher*
ent throughout the record. The lead
track, "Post-Acid" features his sig-
nature snide snarls. He's "just having
fun with you," though. No worries.
Worrying is not something in Wil-
liams's vernacular, anyhow.
Williams's laissez-faire attitude
has served him well - musically,
at least. And while his personal life
has definitely had its ups and downs
(often documented in the lyrics of his
songs), they sure make for one hell of
a summer album.

Taylor excelswithUSAFutures at World Cup

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Wearing a uniform of red, white
and blue, Michigan softball pitcher
Jordan Taylor pulled up to the Ama-
teur Softball Association Hall of Fame
Stadium in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
ready to compete against some of the
world's top players.
Taylor, who was named in mid-
May to compete on the USA Futures
team in the 2010 KFC World Cup of
Softball, couldn't wait to step on the
mound.
But at her first sight of the stadium,
the senior saw the Women's College
World Series Championship banner
congratulating UCLA on their Nation-
al Championship and immediately felt
a pain in the bottom of her stomach.
"Pulling up to the stadium for the
first time was hard," Taylor said.
"There (was) UCLA Champions 2010
stuff everywhere. I didn't think it
was going to be difficult. I didn't even
think about it.
"But it definitely put a little fire
back in me, if there wasn't already one,
to really get back next year. Everyone
knew that we really missed a golden
opportunity with last year's team. I
think it will kind of kick us in our butts
a little bit to get back there."
Taylor took it upon herself to ignite
the fire for next season's Wolverines
team by putting her talents on dis-

play for the USA Futures team. The
Futures team - comprised of the best
current collegiate softball players
from around the country - took third
place in the competition, with a 3-4
overall record.
The competition featured the USA
National team, the USA Futures team
and all-star teams from Canada and

about who is
going to be the
new pitcher."
Japan. With little time to practice
and facing all-star lineups on tap each
night, Taylor had to quickly get com-
fortable with new catchers and the
defense behind her.
In the Futures' first game against
Canada, Taylor got the nod to pitch
the seventh inning and was credited
with her first save of the competition,
as the team beat Canada 5-4 on July
23.
Taylor was also the starting pitcher
in the team's first game against the
USA National team the following day
and kept the best professional softball

players in the United States on their
toes before surrendering the loss, 1-0.
In the loss, Taylor only gave up three
hits while striking out four.
"When you're facing teams like
these, you can't miss a pitch," Taylor
said. "It really brings the competitive
drive out of me.
"It opened my eyes a little bit to
exactly what I could do and what I
would be able to do, which is keep one
of the best hitting teams to one run.
It just gave me a little bit more confi-
dence in my abilities."
The right-hander also tossed the
third-place game of the competition,
as the Futures secured third place in
the World Cup with Taylor's complete
game performance. She struck out
seven batters in the 9-3 Futures' vic-
tory on July 26.
"I've always had a competitive
drive, but I think it was upped a little
bit more after playing with this team,"
Taylor said. "I (saw) that I could com-
pete in international play against some
of the best players and against teams
that have been playing together for
up to 10 years ... It definitely showed
me that I need to start being my own
pitcher, and that I don't need to con-
stantly be like other pitchers and use
their strategies."
The hurler pitched 16 total innings
and finished the tournament with a
team-best 1.69 ERA in four games.
Taylor gave up eight hits and three

earned runs and only one home run,
while striking out 11 and walking just
three.
The 2010 KFC World Cup of Soft-
ball marked United States' ace pitcher
Jennie Finch's retirement from pro-
fessional softball - a departure that
was filled with memories and sadness
from USA National and Futures team
members alike.
But with Finch finished competing
for the USA, the National team's pitch-
ing situation has drastically changed.
Taylor has already recognized the

possibilities the future could hold if
she stays focused on her game.
"The national roster is extremely
difficult to get on, and now that Jen-
nie Finch retired there is a buzz about
who is going to be the new pitcher,"
Taylor said. "The pitching spots are
always competitive.
"There are girls who have been on
the border (of securing that spot) for
a couple years now. You have to be on
your game and do well, and playing for
the Futures has given me more moti-
vation to do (my) best."

Bauer sisters fall short in Michigan Amateur

Ashley and Meagan
Bauer suffer losses in
quarterfinal play
By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
It was a long shot for the Bauer sis-
ters, but the potential was there.
After making it through the quali-
fier at the 94th Annual Michigan
Women's Amateur last Monday and
Tuesday, Ashley and Meagan Bauer
found themselves on opposite sides
of the 32-person match-play bracket.
Both would have to win four matches
in order to face each other in the finals
on Friday.
Despite playing fairly well in high-
pressure situations throughout the
tournament, the sisters fell in the

quarterfinals, ending their bid to
eventually face each other.
Ashley, who graduated from the
Ross School of Business in the spring,
holds nearly every record in the Mich-
igan women's golf record book.
After shooting 75-69 to qualify
for the match-play tournament as
the fourth seed, Ashley won her first
round match against 29th-ranked
Molly Esordi, 3 & 2. In the second
round, she defeated 20th-ranked
Sarah Johnson to move on to the quar-
terfinals.
"I played really well and made a
lot of putts in the first round," Ashley
said. "I was never really more than
one up, I think, until the last couple
holes in the first match. In the sec-
ond match, we both didn't play our 'A'
game. I got a couple breaks on that.
Both of us didn't play to our potential."
Meagan, a junior on the golf team

this coming fall, was the 11th-seed
after posting 79-73 in the qualifier,
defeated 22nd-seed Michelle Bowles 3
& 1 in the first round and sixth-seeded
Alexandra Lipa 2 & 1 in the second
round.
Two more victories stood in the
way of a possible Bauer-versus-Bauer
final. The two sisters had never played
against each other in match play
before. Unfortunately, it would stay
that way. On Thursday, Meagan faced
Michigan State senior and third-seed
Natalie Brehm in the quarterfinals.
After losing the first three holes,
it appeared that Meagan would be
defeated easily, until she fought back
and cut the deficit to just one going
into No. 17. But it was too little, too
late, as Brehm parred the par-4, 17th,
and Meagan bogeyed after hitting her
approach shot into the bunker.
"It was pretty close when it got

towards the end," Meagan said. "I felt
like it could have gone either way, but I
just didn't quite make it through.
I went out there and tried my best.
"Unfortunately
I came up a
couple short, but
I played well."
You win some and you lose some, and
unfortunately it didn't end up how I
wanted."
On Thursday afternoon, Ashley
squared off in a nail-biter against Ohio
State sophomore and fifth-seed Amy

Meier in her quarterfinal match.
After draining a 20-foot birdie putt
on No. 15 to win the hole, Ashley was
down one with three to play. She fol-
lowed that up by hitting her approach
shot to within 10 feet of the hole on
No. 16, and it appeared that she was in
great shape to even up the match. But
she went on to three-putt the hole and
Meier two-putted, and just like that
Ashley was two down. After another
nice approach shot to about eight feet
on No. 17, Ashley failed to convert the
birdie putt and both she and Meier
parred, giving the victory to Meier.
"I missed a couple of putts that cost
me, which seems to be the story of my
career to anyone who's watched me,"
she said. "Unfortunately I came up
a couple short, but I played well. I'm
disappointed that I didn't make those
putts, but (Meier) played very well
too."

Former Michigan running backs

year as Wolverines in 2009, and the
duo still managed to shine - even
though they had to share carries

some to Michigan quarterbacks

The running game for the Wolver-
ines is less defined than it was years
ago, and no one is going to carry the
football 250-plus times next season.
That's because Michigan has anoth-
er crowded backfield, with no clear
talent that stands out above the rest.
Brown and Minor were supposed
to carry the offense last year, and
they tried. Minor rushed for 502
yards and eight touchdowns and

Michigan sophomore running back Vincent Smith, pictured left, and junior Mike Shaw, should share the majority of carries for coach Rich F

touchdowns - Brown even ran for a
career-high 187 yards against East-
ern Michigan on just 13 carries.
But those two are gone now, and
Michigan's leading returning rusher
is sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson. He averaged 5.1 yards a
carry last season and finished with
351 yards rushing and five touch-
downs.
Sophomore quarterback Tate
Forcier isn't a slouch either, and he
had his fair share of plays within
Rodriguez's spread-option offense.
Forcier ran for 240 yards and three
touchdowns.
As for the true running back posi-
tion, the Wolverines have about five

players who could share carries.
Sophomore Vincent Smith might
be the favorite to garner the largest
share of carries, but he's recovering
from an ACL injury and missed the
Spring Game due to an injury suf-
fered at the end of last season. He
averaged 5.8 yards per carry in just
under 50 carries last season.
Junior Mike Shaw is the veteran
of the group, and during his Michi-
gan career, he hasn't really had the
chance to be the go-to guy in the
backfield. He was overlooked because
of Brown and Minor last year, and his
freshman year was the Sam McGuffie
show in Ann Arbor.
All the while, Shaw showed the

ability to catch the ball out of the
backfield. tie averaged over five
yards per carry his freshman year
and saw that fall to 4.4 yards per
carry last year. He's carried the ball
just 42 times in each of his freshman
and sophomore years.
At the very least, Shaw could be
a change-of-base running back who
could also moonlight as a threat to
catch the ball out of the backfield.
Redshirt sophomore Mike Cox
made his big splash against Delaware
State last season, rushing for 82 yards
on 11 carries and scoring two touch-
downs. In that game, albeit against
inferior competition, Cox showed he
could be a physical back that could

also run away from defenders.
And the final two candidates to
carry the ball for Michigan in the fall
are running backs who have never
played a down for the Wolverines.
Redshirt freshman Fitzgerald
Toussaint and true freshman Ste-
phen Hopkins each drew praise
during spring practice, with both
receiving important reps during the
Spring Game. He could factor in as
one of the quicker running backs,
and could be dangerous in breaking
off some long runs.
Hopkins is the big back of the
group, listed at 236 pounds. Hav-
ing a big back that's agile is always
important - around the goal line
especially. That might be Hopkins's
calling card and one reason to avoid
redshirting him.
Each running back brings some-
thing different to the table. Com-
bined with the quarterback's ability
to run, Michigan could improve on
its rushing numbers from a year ago.
And with a more experienced and
more conifortable offensive line, that
will only help the running game.
If Smith is healthy, he showed the
shiftiness and big-play ability to be a
versatile first option at running back
for Rodriguez. Behind him, it could
come down to who is producing the
most.
Rodriguez will have the luxury
of letting the play on the field truly
decide who gets the most carries in
2010.
